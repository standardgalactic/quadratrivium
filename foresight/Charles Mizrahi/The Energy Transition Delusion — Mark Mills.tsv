0	4520	And there is no transition going on in the energy markets.
4520	6480	It's just not visible in the data.
6480	10040	So in my world also data, data matters.
10040	15200	And the idea that we're in the middle of an accelerating transition is not showing up
15200	16200	in the data.
16200	25040	In fact, if we then go one step further and talk about aspirations, which is the aspiration,
25040	31200	that's when you get to the delusion.
31200	32960	My guest today is Mark Mills.
32960	36880	Mark is a physicist, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and was named energy
36880	40120	writer of the year by the American Energy Society.
40120	43720	He has written several award-winning books, including his latest, The Cloud Revolution,
43720	48920	and The Convergence of New Technologies will unleash the next economic boom and a roaring
48920	50480	2020s.
50480	54800	The Binding Administration plans to eliminate fossil fuels as a form of energy generation
54800	57080	in the U.S. by 2035.
57080	58720	Not so, says Mark.
58720	62560	I recently sat down with him and he shared with me why the administration's transition
62560	66520	to green energy is a delusion, in fact, impossible.
66520	76000	And here we are going to need fossil fuel for at least the next several decades.
76000	77800	Mark, thanks so much for coming on the show.
77800	78800	Greatly appreciated.
78800	79800	This is your second time.
79800	82320	I remember the first time you came, it was about a year ago or so.
82320	83320	It seems like yesterday.
83320	84320	Yeah.
84320	85320	It's our anniversary.
85320	86320	Anniversary.
86320	88560	We're going to have to get a cake.
88560	89560	What's the first anniversary?
89560	90560	What is that?
90560	91560	I think paper or something.
91560	92560	I don't know.
92560	93560	Okay.
93560	94560	I know.
94560	95560	You didn't send me any flowers, any any chocolates.
95560	96560	I got nothing.
96560	97560	I got buckets.
97560	98560	Wait till after.
98560	99560	Wait till after the show.
99560	100560	All right.
100560	106480	So you were on the show about a year ago, and you totally enlightened me as to fossil
106480	110280	fuels, EVs, green energy.
110280	114960	And I remember at the time you just went through, because you just went right through with how
114960	120680	green energy isn't so green or clean, especially when we talk about electric vehicles.
120680	125200	So before we even begin, before we even begin, I want to bring you back to the state of the
125200	127440	union address.
127440	131440	President Biden is giving the state of the union, it was February 7th, so not too long
131440	132440	ago.
132440	134360	And he goes totally off script.
134360	135360	It's not on the transcript.
135360	136360	It's not anywhere.
136360	140320	He says, we are still going to need oil and gas for a while.
140320	144640	And then he tells a little anecdote, an oil executive asked him why his company, why his
144640	149040	company should invest in fossil fuel projects in light of the negative business atmosphere
149040	151000	for oil and gas projects.
151000	156480	And Biden responded, we're going to need oil for at least another decade and beyond.
156480	162760	You coined this a while ago, the energy transition delusion.
162760	167680	Tell me why.
167680	174640	Well, in the world that I live in, and this is not universal, not universal, I like to
174640	176120	believe words have meaning.
176120	182820	So I sort of, let's start with, and I recognize that words are elastic and we change their
182820	184320	meanings over time.
184320	186160	But usually it takes a long time.
186160	191400	So a transition means going from something from one place to another, it's a transition.
191600	194160	There is no transition going on in the energy markets.
194160	196120	It's just not visible in the data.
196120	199680	So in my world also data matters.
199680	204840	And the idea that we're in the middle of an accelerating transition is not showing up
204840	205840	in the data.
205840	214640	In fact, if we then go one step further and talk about aspirations, which is the aspiration,
214640	216400	that's when you get to the delusion.
216400	221840	It's not just that it's delusional to call this a transition because there isn't one.
221840	227200	And to restate what I mean by that is we're 20 years into what we could call the era of
227200	229920	climate awareness, at least 20 years into it.
229920	235160	The Western world was spent directly about $5 trillion, and I believe probably indirectly
235160	236160	another $5 trillion.
236160	241360	Well, let's say rounded up to about $10 trillion to avoid using hydrocarbons over the last
241360	242880	20 years.
242880	246760	And the share of the world's energy coming from hydrocarbons has indeed gone down in
246760	247760	those 20 years.
247760	252520	It's gone down from 86% to 84%.
252520	257120	So that doesn't look like a rapid transition after $20 trillion of spending.
257120	258520	It doesn't look like a transition.
258520	264040	In fact, it's not a transition because over that same time period, the quantity of hydrocarbons
264040	269000	consumed in absolute terms has gone up, and to put it in sort of relative terms has gone
269000	275760	up by a quantity equal to adding 5 or 6 Saudi Arabia's worth of oil production in terms
275760	276880	of energy equivalent.
276880	280720	So that's the world's using more of everything, so that's not a transition.
280720	284960	That's a feel like, you know, the better word to be transformation, we're adding new
284960	290240	form of energy to the broad energy mix, which is a lot of windmills and solar arrays.
290240	291240	This is true.
291240	294720	We're adding new kinds of machines like electric vehicles.
294720	298720	This is also indisputably true, and then we're going to add lots more of them.
298760	300400	But that's not a transition.
300400	305960	In fact, all of history, the development of new ways of producing and delivering energy
305960	307440	to society have been additive.
307440	313160	In fact, there's a sort of last point that I made many times I should make again.
313160	315760	It's not that I like windmills.
315760	318440	I've been in wind farms that stress the horizon in China.
318440	319440	I think they're oppressive.
319440	321360	I like solar arrays.
321360	323160	In a way, my first patent was a solar device.
323160	328120	It actually was a photo detector for guiding missiles, but I was a cold warrior back in
328120	330440	the day, so I like the technology.
330440	332200	I think I understand the technology.
332200	333600	I'm a fan of the technology.
333600	337160	If I were making a prediction today, I would say that the share of the world's energy coming
337160	342840	from wind and solar in the coming decade will at least double, at least setting aside all
342840	345520	the money being thrown at it foolishly.
345520	349760	Even without that, we're going to increase the use of it because it's more cost effective
349760	350760	than it ever was.
350760	353200	So it has an enormous role, really important.
353200	358240	But here we are today, to make the point again, all this excitement about wind and solar.
358240	365320	As of right now, after trillions of spending, wind and solar combined provide the world
365320	370560	one third as much energy as burning wood globally, burning wood.
370560	372440	Wood is the oldest energy source known to man.
372440	376880	We still get triple the energy globally from burning wood than we do from wind and solar
376880	377960	combined.
377960	380040	That's not because wind and solar won't take over wood.
380040	381920	It has an America finally.
381920	386840	So we now get twice to three times more energy from wind and solar than we do from burning
386840	387840	wood.
387840	388840	But it just takes time.
388840	389880	It costs a lot of money.
389880	396720	So the point of the delusion language is not meant to be an invective, although I guess
396720	399160	it's obviously provocative.
399160	403760	It's not there in the data where we are.
403760	407000	And the more difficult thing to answer is, well, why can't we get there?
407000	408400	I mean, so we heard it from the president.
408400	414000	In a, I guess you could call it a form of social Tourette's, maybe.
414000	420240	I mean, I'm not sure why Trump had social Tourette's even more epically than this president.
420240	422480	Any president goes off script.
422480	425480	So he says something that he has to know is true.
425480	430280	And his energy secretary has since he said that off script remark, been running around
430280	435040	the country, repeating that statement, actually went to the biggest energy conference in the
435040	441720	world is zero week that my friends, Dan Jurgen, you know, pioneered and created down in Houston.
441720	445400	And it brings people from all over the world and all forms of energy, not just oil and
445400	446400	gas.
446400	450680	She went there, secretary of energy, said, again, we're going to need oil and gas for
450680	452260	a long time yet.
452260	457960	And she sort of modified that, not just 10 years, when the reason she modified it with
457960	462760	sort of more open ended, how long we'll need it is obvious.
462760	466880	If you thought, if you thought as a business, pretend it's your money, that you have to
466880	470520	make multi-billion dollar investments today and the government is going to ban your product
470520	472720	in 10 years.
472720	473720	Would you make those investments?
473720	474720	Well, of course not.
474720	480480	And of course, the current level of investing oil and gas is at a epic, if cyclical low,
480480	485560	maybe lower than in relative terms than it's ever been in modern modern history.
485560	488920	And why, why, why are the investments down?
488920	492600	Is it because the oil and gas industry is afraid of competition?
492600	494880	I don't think they're afraid of competition.
494880	498160	What they're afraid of is regulation and taxation.
498160	502560	And so you slow down and wait to see when things calm down and being simplistic, there
502560	503560	are lots of factors.
503560	508040	But if you're on a board and you're sort of thinking about these things, you know, you're
508040	512680	making a lot of money now at current prices, even if even the current soften prices.
512680	513680	What's the hurry?
513680	518360	Let's just wait and see how things settle out and see what, if they're serious, I mean,
518560	519760	I guess I would.
519760	523800	This, by the way, this, this is already the same phenomenon as already in playing out
523800	530840	in utility scale wind and solar where investments are down as subsidies get complicated.
530840	537040	Nobody knows what the rules are as in as real costs have risen both for the costs of the
537040	545000	machines and as the financing costs have risen because of interest rates and as uncertainties
545000	550280	have risen with respect to if you're the developer going to put billions to work, you
550280	554600	might, you might begin to worry about the tolerance of markets to high cost energy.
554920	561440	And one of the things that is sort of central to the trope of the energy transition is that
561440	562600	wind and solar are cheaper.
562760	564240	That's just central to the thesis.
564440	566120	It's baked into every forecast.
566680	573560	And yet there is no jurisdiction in the world, in Europe or United States, no state and no
573560	579240	country in which the increased penetration of wind and solar has led to reduced utility
579640	582400	grid costs have all been associated with higher costs.
582840	589800	So if they're cheaper and we're at epic levels of spending, I'm waiting for the cheaper power
589800	592520	if you're a consumer and the inverses happen.
592520	598720	So I think, you know, cooler minds setting aside the hyperbole around all this stuff and
598720	603240	the anxiety about why we have to do this, which is beyond obvious what the motivations are.
604440	613480	You know, the combination of scale imposing real costs, the combination of the exposure of
614200	619400	the fragility of energy systems that the Ukraine invasion illustrated, because what Europe did
619400	623000	was build a more economically and structurally fragile energy system.
623480	628600	And by that I mean both by depending on an unreliable source of cheap energy, but also
629320	634120	failing to build in their own borders, reliable sources of cheap energy.
634600	635320	Right.
635320	640280	So all of this, let me, you packed up, you threw out a lot of great information there.
640280	646920	I just want to go back to one thing, that the Biden administration was talking about being,
647640	652600	going to zero missions, totally green energy out at 2035 or 2050.
652600	654520	All those dates really have been thrown out the window.
654520	656920	They were just dates probably just to get out there, right?
657480	660600	The numbers and the facts and the data didn't support any of that, right?
661560	666520	No, there's no, there's, I think what we have is the Energy Information Administration,
666520	671640	which is the Department of Energy's, I mean, tautological information agency.
672360	674200	It's pretty, it's pretty apolitical.
674200	678360	They've been very good over the, over the decades in providing data based on what's
678360	681480	actually happening as opposed to policy aspirations.
681480	686280	Their goal is not to make the policy, but to make forecasts, report data.
687480	690600	Make forecasts based on stated policy.
690600	696600	And they just issued their latest analysis and they show that pushing out to 2030, 2035, 2040,
696600	698520	we don't get anywhere near zero missions.
698520	700920	If you implement everything in the Inflation Reduction Act,
701560	706200	set aside the Orwellian name for that, but all the spending, which is hundreds of billions,
706200	710600	literally probably direct spending and mandated spending.
710600	713640	Cause a lot of these things have mandates that are off book spending.
713640	719160	So there's probably a trillion dollars of spending in the two pieces of legislation,
719160	725240	Infrastructure Act, Inflation Reduction Act on wind solar transmission and electric cars.
725240	730760	And what you get is, you know, something like 15 to 20% reduction in US CO2 emissions by
731320	736840	2040 or so, which, okay, I mean, that's not zero, but it's not zero missions.
736840	741560	And more importantly, as the EIA points out, and now there's this, that reduction,
741560	744680	which is about a gigatonic carbon dioxide, by the way,
745240	749400	we've already gone down about a gigatonic carbon dioxide in the last 20 years,
749400	752680	mostly because of the cheap shale gas replacing coal, of course.
752680	757960	But that's wiped out by three to four years of increased coal consumption
758600	761880	in China alone, never mind India, Indonesia and other places.
761880	763880	So there's, there's sort of this bizarre,
766440	771160	it's almost surreal ignoring of what's going, really going on in the world.
771720	777640	Which is CO2 emissions are going up as countries expand and chase energy that's cheap.
777640	783720	And the CO2 emissions reductions coming in the United States come at staggering costs
783720	786040	and have no effect on the overall global trends.
786680	796440	And even Bill Gates at the last great gathering that gets vilified in Davos,
796440	799800	gave a, you know, private interview and talked about all this stuff.
799800	803640	And he, and he said, and I don't think I'm gonna get the quote wrong.
803640	804920	So two things that are important.
805560	811000	One is that even if we get to zero emissions by 2050, he doesn't think we can.
811960	815000	Things we have to try, obviously he said that a lot, but we're not going to.
815000	820840	But even if we got there, then that would not mean that the world's warming won't continue.
820840	826680	The models would show the world will continue to warm roughly as much as the models purport
826680	827400	it will do now.
828600	830120	Whether you believe the models or not, it's not the point.
830120	834760	The models don't show any material change going out for the next century after that,
835640	837480	even if we spend that kind of money.
837480	841080	The thing that really bothers me, what animates most of my work is not,
841720	847400	it's not just that it's a delusionary to think that we can get rid of hydrocarbons quickly.
848440	848920	Not never.
848920	853000	Never is different than quickly, but quickly meaning in the foreseeable future in decades
853720	857880	is that the cost of doing this is economically and socially destructive.
857880	861480	It is, in my view, immoral.
861480	863320	And it's immoral for this reason.
863880	872040	The whole world has, really all of history, pursued the goal of increasing wealth
872040	874520	for the maximum number of people, increasing productivity.
874520	879640	Productivity is always defined very simplistically, but 100% accurately,
879640	883880	getting more outputs for fewer inputs of dollars, labor and materials.
884440	889080	The energy transition aspirations get the same outputs, if you're lucky,
889080	892200	with increased inputs of dollars, labor and materials.
892840	897320	This is, it puts more simply, this is wealth destroying.
897880	901320	And at the scales we're talking about, I don't mean having a few percent of electricity
901320	905720	from wind and solar and 100 million electric cars, that's irrelevant.
905720	907160	It's in the noise, frankly.
908040	910840	But the scales imagined, it's profoundly wealth destroying.
911400	915160	And the people who are impacted by that are not the wealthy.
915800	917320	So the wealthy are less wealthy.
917880	919240	Okay, no one cares.
919960	924360	It's the wealth destruction of the middle class and the people who are poor.
926360	932840	It's indescribably offensive to me to have a path that's doing that,
932840	937160	which is not the same as saying, because it always gets, one label is all,
937160	939880	then you don't care about what we have to try to do.
941160	942680	I care about changing energy systems.
942680	943560	I may not agree with you.
944600	946760	It was like, it's like an interrupter.
946760	951240	I haven't met anyone who would say they're pro-pollution.
951240	952840	They want more pollution in the future.
952840	954120	We're all on the same side.
954120	957000	It's just, as you mentioned, how much it's going to cost
957000	959800	and how much benefit are we going to get for each dollar spent?
960120	967080	It's beyond obvious the money matters, or symmetrically follow the money,
967080	970840	as the old ad is about saying who benefits from different policies.
970840	972200	But here's the problem.
972200	975400	It's not only is the rest of the world increasing its carbon dioxide emissions
975400	980600	as the West tries to reduce it at extraordinarily high costs.
981240	982840	It's that it's not doing what people claim.
983480	987240	I mean, it's dishonest, intellectually dishonest,
987240	990760	to pretend, for example, the electric cars are zero emissions.
990760	991240	They're not.
991240	992520	They're elsewhere emissions.
992520	996680	What you'd want to know is how much the emissions are today
997480	1002760	and how much they will be in the future as you push harder on getting more EVs in the market
1004280	1008440	to result in the higher emissions to make the vehicles.
1009160	1012120	Obviously, it offsets emissions from combusting gasoline.
1012120	1015480	This is beyond obvious and infantile observation,
1015480	1016600	but it's not zero emissions.
1017160	1018680	It's other place emissions.
1019720	1021800	People know that reflexively when you say it.
1021800	1024360	I mean, they say, OK, yeah, well, I have to have a power plant
1024360	1026920	and everybody jokes about how the power plant could be coal fired.
1026920	1028040	Well, that's no joke.
1028040	1029160	I mean, it depends.
1029160	1030680	It depends on where you charge the car.
1031320	1035160	And when you charge the car, how you're filling that battery up.
1035160	1039560	I mean, this may be obvious, but it's most of the calculations that purport
1039560	1043640	an electric vehicle is zero emissions are based on average emissions from a grid.
1044360	1045720	Well, there's no average.
1045720	1049400	There's no average emissions in filling the vehicle.
1049400	1053400	When the vehicle is fueled is when the emissions occur.
1053400	1057320	So if you fuel the vehicle at night in some parts of the United States,
1057320	1060120	you're filling it with hydro hydro electricity in other places.
1060120	1061560	Let me just let me just drill down on this.
1061560	1065800	And so we're on the same page and our listeners could get this.
1066760	1068040	True, there is nothing.
1068040	1070760	No emissions coming out of the vehicle.
1071480	1072200	But fuel.
1072200	1073800	There's no tailpipe.
1073800	1075160	So apparently there's not.
1075160	1081400	But fueling by plugging in your EV, you are creating emissions by.
1081400	1081800	Somewhere.
1082600	1083240	Electricity.
1083240	1083720	Making power.
1083720	1085240	Which doesn't come from magic dust.
1085960	1086520	No.
1086520	1092280	So you would and the EV focus is important because it's the preoccupation
1092280	1093480	of governments these days, right?
1093480	1097400	We've we've moved beyond mandating 100% wind and solar.
1098120	1100840	That's sort of old news and we can't get there fast enough.
1100840	1102680	So we have the grids that we have.
1102680	1103960	Grids take time to build out.
1104520	1107560	But it gets that there's lots more wind and solar on grids,
1107560	1108440	depending where you live.
1109400	1110440	The most is in Texas.
1110440	1112840	The second most is in the midcontinent of the United States.
1112840	1113640	Lots of windmills.
1114520	1117640	How far that can go is an interesting separate discussion.
1118280	1122120	And they too don't have tailpipe, so to speak.
1122120	1124040	They don't emit anything when they're operating.
1124040	1126840	They do cause emissions when they get built.
1126920	1129880	Because windmills are built from concrete and steel,
1129880	1135800	which require metallurgical coal and coal and oil and natural gas to make and fabricate.
1135800	1139720	But you know, measured over the lifetime of the operation,
1139720	1142840	it emits less CO2 than burning natural gas.
1142840	1143240	It's true.
1145080	1149640	How much that costs you is what matters, not whether that's true or not.
1149640	1152840	But the EV has sort of become the monomaniacal preoccupation.
1152840	1156440	I think at last count, I think there's now a dozen states.
1156840	1158520	The number may have gone up in the last month.
1158520	1160680	I think the state of Maryland, where I live,
1160680	1162200	as the governor said they're going to pledge,
1163160	1167240	a dozen states that are proposing by 2035 or 2040,
1167240	1171480	depending on the state, to utterly ban the sale of internal combustion engines completely.
1172040	1176120	I think the number of countries that have made such proclamations or planned to make them
1176120	1177080	is now the dozens.
1177720	1183400	So this is all predicated entirely on that these are zero emissions vehicles.
1183400	1184760	That's the entire predication.
1185080	1186200	I want you to hang on right there.
1186200	1188600	I want you to hang on right there because when we spoke last time,
1189320	1195320	you pointed out, I said, Charles, these cars don't show up in the showroom by magic.
1195320	1196920	It took something to get there.
1196920	1199320	And you pointed me in the direction of Volkswagen,
1199320	1205080	and who had it on their site, which showed the crossover between an EV and a,
1205080	1206680	I think it was a diesel powered car.
1206680	1207720	I'm not sure what their thing was.
1207720	1208200	Right.
1208200	1209240	Yeah, it was diesel.
1209240	1214440	Close to seven years before the 70,000 miles.
1214440	1215480	70,000 miles, right?
1215480	1217240	Which is 10,000 miles a year, let's say.
1217240	1219720	So you're talking about seven years on average,
1219720	1225720	seven years before the EV makes sense in terms of emitting CO2.
1225720	1226680	Is that more or less right?
1227800	1230120	Yeah, they're studying others.
1230120	1231000	They're not alone on this.
1231000	1232680	Volvo published a similar analysis.
1232680	1234680	So what they're doing is they're doing two things.
1235480	1238760	They're counting the emissions that's needed to make the EV and its battery.
1239400	1241480	And the emissions needed to make the internal combustion engine.
1242040	1248760	And so these are the noble processes to mine minerals at copper and aluminum
1249480	1253080	and refine them and assemble them into an electric vehicle.
1253080	1255880	And you do the same with the steel to make an internal combustion engine.
1255880	1256680	So you count that.
1257480	1260840	It's called embodied emissions or embodied energy.
1260840	1262200	It's our body.
1262200	1267560	So you count what it takes just to get the vehicle to your driveway, the emissions for that.
1268200	1272760	And everything has emissions associated with manufacturing because hydrocarbons are used
1272760	1273560	everywhere.
1273560	1277320	So that's the world we live in, not the world we aspire to be in in the far future.
1277960	1283560	And then you look, in the case of both these studies, at the average, back to the average,
1283560	1287480	is the average emissions from the electricity you have available in Europe
1288280	1290920	over the coming five to 10 years to operate the vehicle.
1290920	1294040	Because the grid that exists is the grid that you're going to use,
1294040	1295960	not the grid your imagined will exist in the future.
1296760	1301800	And yes, so what they determined is that for the first seven years of driving,
1301800	1305000	if you'd driven the diesel vehicle, you would have admitted less CO2
1305640	1306760	than if you bought the EV.
1307400	1310200	Because a combination of the two emissions, the battery beam,
1311160	1314280	the mining and the battery being fabricated, and the power plants
1314840	1317960	took you that long to pay off your carbon debt.
1317960	1318920	Now, this is important.
1318920	1325800	The Volkswagen study was based on a small EV using a battery less than half the size
1325800	1326760	of a Tesla battery.
1326760	1327720	And what was the range of that?
1327720	1329880	So it was a really small range on that battery, right?
1329880	1331320	Yeah, it's a 250-mile range.
1331320	1335480	But for a light vehicle, for round town use, which is a lot of people use them for,
1335480	1338360	that's fine, perfectly reasonable assumption.
1338360	1340440	But most people aren't buying those vehicles at the moment.
1340440	1345880	The biggest sellers are the vehicles with the big batteries in the range of three to 400 miles.
1345880	1348760	So, or put it differently, that means you have a battery twice as big.
1348760	1349960	Your carbon debt is double.
1350920	1355400	So the crossover point shifts out from seven years to 10 or 12 years,
1355400	1357480	which for most people, that's never.
1357480	1361320	Now, if you assume that the vehicle has a second life and in its second life,
1361320	1363960	it's submitting less CO2, okay.
1363960	1368280	But the point is the illusion that you, as the owner of that vehicle,
1368280	1372360	have saved CO2 is totally shattered by those assumptions.
1372360	1374280	Now, here's the rub.
1374280	1379160	We actually don't know exactly how much CO2 is emitted by a specific EV.
1379160	1381960	Because we don't know exactly where the materials came from for that EV.
1382520	1386200	We know exactly how much CO2 is emitted by an internal combustion engine vehicle,
1386200	1390760	because it's the same every time you fill a tank up, there's no change.
1390760	1391960	There's no mystery.
1391960	1392760	It's transparent.
1392760	1393400	It's obvious.
1394040	1398440	What we do know about the emissions associated with manufacturing an EV
1398440	1400200	is those emissions are going up, not down.
1400200	1401720	And it's not me saying this.
1401720	1405160	This is the International Energy Agency, International Monetary Fund,
1405160	1406520	the UN bodies.
1407400	1415640	This is a geological, if you like, fact that the net new ton of copper or steel or aluminum
1415640	1419480	or molybdenum or zinc are coming from what are called lower grade ores.
1419480	1423800	You'd have to dig up more rock to get the same pound or ton of metals.
1423800	1428680	Digging up more rock means more energy and grinding more rock more energy.
1428680	1429800	Let me stop you there one second.
1430760	1437800	You put in one of your papers that you have to move 500,000 pounds of dirt
1438440	1444520	in order to mine enough metals, minerals to make one, one EV battery.
1445080	1446360	Could you just break that down for me?
1447560	1451640	So the way you sort of think about this is as you start with the point,
1451640	1453880	how big is the fuel tank and electric vehicle?
1453880	1458760	If it's the one that everybody buys, not everybody, the majority that would be purchased,
1458920	1465000	they're about a half a ton or 1,000 pounds, the battery, which is a digression tells you why
1465000	1469160	the electric vehicle uses a lot more aluminum on average than a regular vehicle because you're
1469160	1473720	trying to offset what used to be an 80 pounds of gasoline with a 1,000 pound fuel tank.
1474520	1480280	So you offset that by more aluminum, which also causes a lot of emissions.
1480280	1483160	It's a very energy intensive, emissions intensive metal.
1483720	1486360	And that often is not included in the calculations, by the way.
1486360	1489640	It's just left out and ignored by some of the analysts.
1490520	1492360	So you have a 1,000 pound battery.
1493560	1495880	Then you look at the various components of the battery.
1495880	1499160	It's copper, it's steel, and it's aluminum.
1499160	1502120	Has lithium, of course, because it's a lithium-ion battery.
1502120	1503160	Has cobalt.
1503160	1507400	It has far more graphite, by the way, than it does lithium or any other element.
1507400	1510760	It's the most common element, and it's a very intensive
1511400	1514600	material to get to make all forms of lithium batteries.
1514600	1520760	And then what you do is you chase up, this is all findoutable, if you like, in Magic Google
1520760	1521640	Machine.
1521640	1525160	You could look up, what's the average ore grade for copper?
1525160	1526920	What was it 100 years ago or 10 years ago?
1526920	1528440	What's the average ore grade for aluminum?
1528440	1531320	The ore grade for nickel and all the different metals.
1531320	1531960	It's clean ore grade.
1531960	1532520	That is what?
1534040	1538680	So ore grade, and when I was in my impetuous youth, I worked briefly for a mining company.
1538680	1541160	So I have a certain affection for mining and miners.
1541160	1545080	I like a Canadian uranium, gold, and silver mining company.
1546040	1552760	Ore grade means the percentage of the rock that you found, or that contains the stuff you want.
1552760	1557160	So the richest ore grades in the metals world is iron.
1557160	1562760	Iron can be, you can find iron, which is the rock that you're digging up that contains iron,
1562760	1564040	can be 20% iron.
1565000	1566520	So you could do the math here.
1566520	1569080	That means for a pound of iron, you dig up five pounds of rock.
1570040	1575240	Copper, however, and a lot of the other metals are much less common in the earth's crust.
1575240	1578760	So the average copper ore grade now is well below 1%.
1579480	1584120	So a pound of copper, you have to dig up 100 pounds of rock, and it's declining.
1584120	1585880	This is true for every metal.
1586520	1591000	The percentage of the rock that's the metal you want, typically the single digit percentages
1591000	1591880	are a fraction of percent.
1591880	1596280	And if it's the rarer metals, that's so-called rare earths, even more, which aren't rare,
1596280	1597960	by the way, they're actually very common.
1597960	1603160	They just, I mean, in the geology of the earth they're common, geography of the earth,
1603160	1605560	they just aren't, they have rare properties.
1605560	1607880	They're called rare earths because they're properties, not because of their,
1608520	1611960	we know where they are, we know how to find them, you have to dig up lots of dirt.
1611960	1614040	So you have to dig up two kinds of dirt.
1614040	1617080	You have to dig up what's called overburden, you have to get to the ore body.
1617080	1620040	So if you're lucky, it's an open pit mine on the surface.
1620040	1622280	You don't have to get a lot of dirt out of the way.
1622280	1627000	So you have rocks and dirt, you have to get out of the way, dig that up, it's just waste.
1627000	1630840	Then you dig up the ore and then you're digging up again.
1630840	1634360	If it's a ton of copper, you're digging up, you know, not a hundred tons, right?
1634360	1637880	You're digging over over a hundred tons of ore, which you then have to crush
1637880	1640920	with big energy consuming machines into powder.
1640920	1642440	Do you have to crush rocks?
1642440	1645880	Then you have to dissolve the rocks with sulfuric acid.
1645880	1648840	We're dissolving rocks and the more rock you have to dissolve,
1648840	1651960	the more acids you have to use, the more acids, the more energy to make the acids,
1652520	1654440	the more energy to keep everything clean.
1654520	1659640	It means this is a beyond obvious do loop of very energy-intensive activities.
1659640	1662600	And then when you get the refined metal, you have to ship it.
1662600	1666120	This is a refining process like everything else is separate from the mining.
1666120	1670200	Then you have to go to the chemical industries that convert the refined metals
1670200	1675320	or minerals into the nature of the specific material you need for the battery,
1675320	1678440	which is another chemical and energy-intensive process.
1678440	1679000	That's the most...
1679000	1681000	When you put that all together, that's where you get this,
1681800	1687480	you know, not only does it take 500,000 pounds of rock extracted for your one battery,
1688360	1693560	but all in, if you mentioned oil terms, you're going to consume between
1693560	1699320	one in 300 barrels of oil equivalent in energy to make a battery that can hold
1699320	1701560	about one barrel of oil equivalent of energy.
1701560	1702200	Amazing.
1702200	1704200	I looked at two points I just want to share with you,
1704200	1707240	but I don't want to hear you keep talking because I just keep learning so much.
1707560	1715000	These earth-moving machines, huge, huge, huge machines that move all this earth you mentioned,
1715000	1720040	I looked up and the average one is 237,000 gallons per year,
1721240	1722760	12 feet high off the ground.
1722760	1723640	These are huge.
1723640	1727640	And that's why I guess, you know, in mining, energy costs are such a big factor,
1727640	1729560	you know, you have to move this stuff.
1729560	1734520	And it just boggles my mind that people do not take this into account.
1734520	1737720	They think it's fairy dust that it comes here and I did too.
1737720	1741320	I got to admit when I got two of my two Teslas and I traded them,
1741320	1743400	I thought I was doing something great for the environment.
1743400	1750360	And then now every night that I plug it in, I realized that it didn't come here by magic.
1750360	1753640	All of the fuel that was needed to do that.
1753640	1759960	The second thing I just wanted to touch on for us is that most of this refinery
1759960	1764440	is done in China because who the heck wants a refinery in their backyard?
1764440	1764920	Is that right?
1766280	1770760	Yeah. Well, back to your machines, by the way, I love these big mining trucks.
1770760	1774120	They're literally the size of a house, these trucks, the size of a house.
1774120	1774920	They're great.
1774920	1779080	And the idea that we're going to convert those mining trucks to not using diesel in their future is...
1779080	1780360	What are they going to do on solar?
1780360	1781960	You know, these things are huge.
1781960	1785800	You can make them, you can run them on batteries too, if you make enough batteries.
1785800	1791640	But to say it's impractical to do it is a breathtaking understatement.
1792360	1796360	We're not going to be running these trucks anything other than big diesel generators
1796360	1798840	and diesel engines for a very, very long time.
1798840	1800680	And by that I mean, you know, many, many decades.
1800680	1805400	The machines themselves have a life, a useful life of 30 to 40 years.
1805400	1808360	Once you spend millions of dollars, tens of millions of a machine,
1808360	1809800	you're going to run it for a long time.
1809800	1812680	But, you know, back to your question of where the refineries are.
1812760	1816360	I mean, so they're elsewhere.
1816360	1819080	They're not in America or Europe by and large.
1819080	1822520	There's some, not many, very, very few.
1823240	1825400	So what we're doing is we're making an interesting trade.
1825400	1825640	Right.
1825640	1828600	The United States in particular is domestically self-efficient.
1828600	1832120	In fact, in hydrocarbons, we're a net exporter of hydrocarbons if we count all in.
1832760	1837080	We were almost, we were briefly a net exporter of oil and oil products.
1837080	1840600	Right, in 2018, wasn't it 2018 or so we were a net exporter?
1840920	1846840	Well, it was 2019, 2020, into that year, we were still, if you count, you know,
1846840	1849560	we still import because there's an arbitrage, you know, you import crew,
1849560	1850680	you export refined products.
1851240	1857320	But we are functionally independent of the need for imports functionally.
1857320	1862520	I just remember back in the 70s during the energy crisis and going to school there.
1862520	1867160	And it was always a dream that one day America would be self-sufficient.
1867160	1869400	And we had OPEC with a gun to our head.
1869400	1873960	And after the the Arabs really were of 1973, when they placed it in Bargo,
1873960	1877080	the oil was there, but they didn't ship it to us to the United States.
1878120	1880360	We were, we didn't have production.
1880360	1881720	We were way, way behind.
1882280	1887400	And now it seems that we traded off OPEC for China.
1887400	1892120	We're now reliant on China refining our metals and lithium batteries.
1892120	1895400	And this whole green energy seems like to be playing into the hands of China.
1895960	1897480	Is it might be a little crazy on that?
1897480	1899080	Or is that those are the facts?
1899080	1904600	No, it's that you're just stating, let's, let's put aside the geopolitical implications.
1904600	1906360	You could just look at the facts first, right?
1906360	1909480	I mean, the U.S. is a net export of hydrocarbons.
1909480	1911640	China is a net importer of hydrocarbons.
1911640	1916520	China has a market share in refining what the IEA, the International Energy Agency,
1916520	1921720	calls energy minerals, the things like copper and lithium carbonate.
1921720	1928840	So the refining of energy minerals, that capacity in China, in terms of global market share, is
1928840	1931800	double OPEC's global market share in oil.
1932520	1939080	So China by itself is the OPEC on steroids of energy minerals for refining.
1939640	1942760	Hey, if you're a reasonable person, would say, well, can we do something about that?
1942760	1943800	Can we do something about that?
1943800	1945320	Couldn't we resharrow those refineries?
1945320	1945880	Of course we can.
1947240	1950760	You first, you have to want to, you have to put in place the kind of regulatory environment
1950760	1953720	that makes it possible to build them economically.
1953720	1958680	That hasn't happened in any of the legislation by any president, by the way, in decades.
1959240	1964360	So we don't have the appetite politically to do that, and we're not doing it, even if
1964360	1965880	tomorrow we decided to do it.
1966520	1973480	The velocity of demand for those minerals, the mandating batteries be put in cars instead of gas
1973480	1979640	tanks, vastly exceeds the velocity with which we could reshor the supply of those minerals.
1979640	1980920	So the mining is elsewhere.
1980920	1983320	We can't open mines easily in America.
1983320	1990600	The administration last year reversed permits that were millions of dollars in years in
1990600	1994760	development for copper and nickel mines, three of them in the United States, just reversed
1994760	2001400	the permits after many years of trying to get the permits in place and passing all the tests,
2001400	2002280	if you like.
2002280	2004920	They passed in flying colors, they were failed anyway.
2004920	2011160	So the path that we're on is unequivocally one of increasing dependencies on foreign sources
2011160	2014280	for the premier materials and the refined materials.
2014280	2019160	But we're sort of hiding behind the fig leaf of subsidizing what are called EV factories or
2019160	2019960	battery factories.
2019960	2026600	These are assembly plants, which are still dependent on importing metals and materials
2026600	2028760	and minerals refined elsewhere.
2028760	2033960	So it would be no different than the symmetrical equivalent is what you described going back
2033960	2039960	to the dawns of the energy embargoes, oil embargoes, is that we were assembling cars
2039960	2044920	in America and we, in fact, had very few foreign cars sold in America at that time.
2044920	2049240	But we were very dependent on gasoline and oil imports, the fuel cars.
2049240	2054600	So what we're doing now is replicating the exact situation we were in 50 years ago.
2054600	2063000	We just replaced refined minerals and metals and these things with the lithium
2063800	2069880	cobalt, I think with 17 or so of minerals that we need are none of the friendliest places in
2069880	2070520	the world for us.
2072280	2076840	Well, we're, you know, we used to be one of the primary suppliers of many of these metals and
2076840	2077240	minerals.
2077240	2081480	US is geophysically rich in all these metals and minerals.
2081480	2083000	But like, you know, there's nothing wrong.
2083960	2086360	Count me in the free trade camp, right?
2086360	2088360	I'm happy to trade with other countries.
2088360	2092600	When you get trade concentration is when you get geopolitical risks and problems.
2092680	2096920	And of course, the risk with China is beyond obvious.
2096920	2103000	You don't have to be anti-China or pro-China to observe the fact that we're in economic
2103000	2104040	conflict with them for sure.
2104040	2108440	I hope it stays just an economic, we're certainly in political conflict with them.
2108440	2112040	And so we've handed them and they've made this decision 20 years ago.
2112040	2113640	It was public information.
2113640	2116440	They published the fact of their goals.
2116440	2118280	So we knew what they were planning to do.
2118280	2124120	So now we have this sort of odd balance to pick up on what President Biden said and his
2124120	2126840	Secretary of Energy have said, world's going to use oil for a long time.
2127880	2131880	Another point to make is China is going to be dependent on oil and gas imports for a long time
2131880	2132120	too.
2132760	2135960	They can't, they can't match what we've done in the oil and gas world.
2135960	2137560	They're not anywhere close to it.
2137560	2139800	So they, they actually have a bargaining chip now.
2139800	2144120	I mean, if you think about it in this simple geopolitical terms, they had no bargaining
2144120	2148760	chips. They were very deeply dependent on vital energy imports to keep their economy running.
2149640	2155240	We could, we could cause them a lot of pain both directly and indirectly in oil and gas
2155240	2156440	markets, natural gas markets.
2157400	2161320	Well, you know, they could cause an awful lot of pain to the world as the world increases
2161320	2166200	its dependency on energy minerals to build windmills, solar arrays and electric batteries.
2166200	2169160	So it's, it's not an accidental strategy.
2169160	2173080	It's actually a brilliant strategy, especially when you consider they,
2173080	2177240	they now have price control over those energy minerals, because they utterly dominate the
2177240	2179080	market far more again, far more than OPEC.
2179800	2183480	And we, we don't have any effective way to offset that price control,
2184440	2190680	except to do the equivalent of what we did in the gas industry with minerals.
2190680	2191880	Turns out that's a lot harder.
2191880	2197720	I mean, the velocity of opening a mine versus the velocity of getting a oil well in place
2197720	2198680	are profoundly different.
2198680	2199800	They're just the different.
2199880	2205240	This is like, I mean, to put it very simplistically, it's like the difference in the
2205240	2210280	velocity of building a mining truck and building a go-kart.
2210280	2212440	I mean, mines are huge.
2212440	2215240	They take decades to, to build typically.
2215240	2219080	The average in the world is 16 years to go from discovery to to happen.
2219080	2220840	I recently heard you speak about a copper mine.
2220840	2225240	How long does it take from start to finish to start to digging was 16?
2225240	2228280	Yeah, the average IEA says is 16 years, but it could be,
2228760	2233480	it could be 10 years in some, in some jurisdictions, if, if you're lucky, and it could be
2233480	2236600	30 and others, infinite in the United States apparently.
2237240	2241800	But if you wanted to compare that to the oil and gas world, the, the slowest,
2242600	2247640	the most difficult projects in terms of velocity are offshore, offshore rakes, offshore oil projects.
2248200	2253960	And one of the most remarkable accelerations that's occurred, sort of untold stories,
2253960	2257160	is that that's been cut in half from a decade to five years roughly.
2257800	2261880	But still five years to do a billion dollar offshore oil platform to go into production
2261880	2263320	from, you know, discovery to production.
2264120	2267080	A shale well from, you know, you don't have to discover a shale.
2267080	2267720	We know where it is.
2267720	2269000	I've always known where it is.
2269000	2274520	But the decision, let's say decision to production in a shale well depends on where it is,
2274520	2277160	but six months to a year, it's very, very quick.
2278120	2281720	So you're looking at velocities in the oil and gas world
2281720	2285960	that are literally 10 times faster than the velocities in the minerals world.
2286840	2293720	And, and the minerals world's velocities are all attached to foreign jurisdictions,
2293720	2298920	which are opaque, often corrupt, subject to bribes.
2299720	2305480	It's, to, to labor practices that we, we, we would, when we know about them, find offensive.
2305480	2309080	Child labor is rampant in the mining minerals world in Africa and South America.
2309880	2312520	It's not, it's not up to say it's not a nice thing.
2312520	2316920	It's a breathtaking understatement that, but it's generally ignored.
2317720	2321560	As you know, I reviewed a book for the Wall Street Journal recently called Cobalt
2321560	2326600	Red, which the author, professor of human trafficking and slavery in England,
2327880	2329320	was pretty, pretty gutsy.
2329320	2334440	He, he went down to Congo into East and Congo and went visiting the mine sites,
2334440	2338360	which you're not supposed to visit to try to document the extent to which the cobalt
2338360	2342680	mining in particular is done, what's called as euphemism, artisanally,
2343720	2348200	which means by hand with a shovel and how much of that's with children.
2348200	2352120	And of course, he reports that he thinks that the percentage that it's artisanal
2352680	2354360	and child labor is vastly higher.
2355000	2362760	The official estimates are something like 20% of the mining in, in Congo for cobalt is artisanal
2362760	2364440	and maybe half that's with children.
2365160	2369400	He thinks it's far higher, but even if it isn't far higher, it's pretty,
2369400	2371400	it's pretty grotesque when you think about it.
2372280	2372920	Does that matter?
2372920	2378120	Well, yeah, because as he points out correctly, pretty much every lithium battery and every
2378120	2381640	portable device has cobalt because you need it for the energy density.
2382440	2385000	The majority of the world's electric car still use cobalt.
2385560	2389000	And of course, those that don't use cobalt in their batteries, you can,
2389000	2390360	you can switch up the chemistry.
2390360	2393160	There's lots of different chemical soups you can use.
2393160	2395160	You use typically more nickel, for example.
2395800	2398440	So you're shifting your demand for one metal to another,
2398440	2403000	which still takes you on the same path of foreign minds, foreign refining,
2404200	2408840	questionable labor practices, all of which in principle can be fixed and made transparent.
2408840	2412360	In principle, it's just, it's not there right now.
2412360	2413080	It's not where we are.
2414120	2418840	So, yeah, Siddharth Rathkarra, you're referring to a cobalt red.
2419880	2420920	I'm going to have him on the show.
2420920	2421960	He's just fascinating.
2421960	2422600	He read his book.
2422600	2425800	It was just unbelievable what he did exposing.
2425800	2429080	And most of those minds in Congo were in partnership with the Chinese.
2429080	2430520	They were there in 0809.
2430520	2434200	They saw the opportunity right there that the world's going to need cobalt.
2434200	2438200	And every lithium battery, I think it is, cobalt is part of.
2439320	2442600	Well, in every high performance device, lithium battery.
2442600	2448840	But the big, you can, you know, one can make lithium batteries with no cobalt at all.
2448840	2450920	There's lithium iron phosphate batteries.
2450920	2452440	There's nickel manganese batteries.
2452440	2454440	There's lots of different chemical formulations.
2454440	2460200	But as you change the chemical mix, you trade off things like temperature tolerance, fire,
2460200	2461640	safety, range.
2462280	2466520	The now favored lithium iron phosphate, which the pioneered in China,
2467240	2473400	is a very clever battery chemistry, very safe chemistry, relatively speaking,
2473400	2475800	and safer than the cobalt class batteries.
2476680	2478120	But it has lower energy density.
2478120	2483240	So you have to either have a bigger battery to get the range, which so instead of a thousand
2483240	2486600	pound battery, it's 1200 pounds, which means more metals.
2486600	2488200	Which means more aluminum, more FIFO, everything would be.
2488200	2490200	Yeah, more copper, more aluminum, or.
2490200	2490760	Pick your poison.
2490760	2493560	Or you have less range, and everybody's trying to sell range.
2493560	2497640	So in China, you don't have to sell range because there's lots of people without cars.
2497640	2503160	So really small cars with okay range, which is what's going on as a first vehicle
2504120	2509800	with arguably features and safety standards that most Americans won't buy and tolerate.
2510440	2511800	It's a big market for them in China.
2511800	2513320	So that'll be true in India.
2513320	2515560	So I expect there's going to be lots more of those cars.
2515560	2519800	In fact, China's export of their electric vehicles, if you track that data,
2521800	2526520	they have become a powerhouse and not just producing electric vehicles,
2526520	2529400	but exporting electric cars and vehicles in general.
2529400	2531160	They're not to us.
2531160	2532760	We're not buying them yet here.
2532760	2535400	I think that'll happen, but to emerging markets, of course.
2535400	2541320	Yeah, I think EYD just put a showroom together somewhere in the United States with their electric
2541320	2542840	bus, which looks unbelievable.
2543640	2545160	They're going to get a flip to the toehold here.
2547000	2555320	I think probably one of the best engineered batteries for a car in the world is still a Tesla.
2555320	2560440	Dick Elon Musk's focus in this early before everybody else gave him a huge head start,
2560440	2561160	terrific team.
2561880	2563480	The engineering is absolutely brilliant.
2563480	2569560	It really is the level of the energy density and safety and quality on the battery.
2569560	2570920	I'm not talking about the car overall.
2570920	2574680	The car is fine, but it's not a standout in terms of quality.
2574680	2575560	It's just fine.
2576840	2578040	But the battery is impressive.
2578040	2580280	And the rest of the world is catching up.
2580280	2584120	They'll probably get to pair up a suit with him in due course.
2584600	2592600	I would say BYD's batteries probably pretty much on par with Tesla's engineering, getting there.
2592600	2594520	Chinese engineering on this stuff is very good.
2594520	2595800	They've been at it a very long time.
2597240	2599400	I've traveled to China several times.
2599400	2605240	I've been in maybe, I think, 12 or 14 Chinese cities, visited battery factories there and
2605240	2607320	electric car factories and bus factories.
2607320	2610200	This was pre-epic lockdowns, of course.
2611160	2612680	This is the last few years.
2612680	2614280	It's a little more difficult lately.
2615480	2620040	A friend of mine just went there and told me he was put into quarantine 10 days anyway,
2620040	2623640	despite negative tests, passports, visas, vaxes.
2623640	2625560	He still had to be quarantined.
2625560	2627960	So I hope it was a nice hotel.
2627960	2629160	Probably was, knowing him.
2630600	2632280	Here's the thing that's sort of puzzling to me about,
2633720	2636200	and I think it's in people's heads about electric cars.
2636200	2638760	I'll come back to the mythology of this.
2638920	2641240	There are elsewhere omissions and lots of omissions.
2641960	2644760	It's elsewhere dependencies, elsewhere jobs.
2644760	2645960	All those things are all true.
2646600	2651800	But there's this sort of naive belief that it's a simpler vehicle.
2651800	2655080	I mean, look, it's just a battery and electric motor.
2655080	2656040	What could be simpler?
2656040	2656920	Look at that.
2656920	2659080	It's got to be inherently cheaper to make eventually.
2661560	2664840	If that were true, if they were inherently simpler,
2664840	2666120	that might be true.
2666120	2667640	It would be inherently cheaper to make.
2667640	2668840	But it's not true.
2668840	2671400	The battery is not like the little double-A cell
2671400	2673320	you stick in a child's toy.
2673320	2678440	This half-ton engine, it's actually an electrochemical engine,
2679000	2680600	has thousands of parts in it.
2681480	2684360	If it's a Tesla battery, maybe tens of thousands of parts,
2684360	2688520	but lots of batteries, thousands of parts, tens of thousands of welds,
2688520	2692440	cooling systems, electronic control systems, structural systems.
2692440	2697000	It's a complicated, multi-thousand-part electrochemical engine.
2697640	2698520	The motor is simple.
2698520	2700040	Electric motor has two moving parts.
2700760	2704280	In an internal combustion engine, we just flop the complexities.
2704840	2707240	The fuel tank has two moving parts.
2707240	2710920	It's an electric motor that pumps your fuel, two moving parts.
2710920	2711720	A little tiny one.
2712520	2713400	The tank has nothing yet.
2713400	2714840	It's just fluid.
2715400	2717320	The engine, on the other hand,
2717320	2720280	instead of being an electrochemical engine with thousands of parts,
2720280	2723320	it's a thermochemical engine with thousands of parts.
2724280	2727960	We've just swapped mechanical, thermo-mechanical complexity
2727960	2730040	for electrochemical complexities.
2730040	2731320	They're both complex.
2731880	2735880	They both wear out at the molecular level.
2735880	2738360	Wear and tear on an engine with reciprocating parts
2738360	2739880	is literally at the molecular level.
2741320	2746440	Batteries wear out, electrochemistry wears out at the molecular level.
2746440	2750680	They both have performance characteristics that vary with temperature,
2751400	2753400	all kinds of both have safety issues.
2754920	2759400	The difference between them is that the complicated fuel tank
2760520	2765880	in an electric car is made of expensive minerals
2765880	2769320	as opposed to cheap iron ore and steel.
2770200	2775240	The mineral costs that go into a battery constitute about 70% or 80%
2775240	2776920	of the cost to make the battery.
2776920	2779800	Once you know that we now are making batteries so efficiently,
2780280	2782680	if I took all the labor out and said the labor was free,
2783480	2786440	the capital and the overhead for the automated machines is free,
2787240	2791960	that would reduce the cost of a battery by 20%, 25%.
2791960	2792440	That's it.
2794200	2795160	It's not game-changing.
2795160	2797400	What you're left with is, put differently,
2797400	2800360	is the future cost of batteries for electric cars,
2800360	2802520	which dominates the cost of the electric car,
2802520	2805080	is entirely dependent on the future of the mining industry.
2806200	2808920	What we're making a bet on when we tell people
2808920	2810760	they won't be able to buy internal combustion engines
2810760	2813800	is a bet that the mining industry will cooperate
2813800	2816360	and provide both enough minerals and metals
2816360	2819080	and cheaply enough to keep consumers happy.
2819080	2823240	The mining operations in parts of the world
2823240	2825320	which are not the friendliest in the United States.
2827240	2828040	Well, they're not here.
2828040	2830440	And they're also, I mean, the most important point, of course,
2830440	2832280	is that the cost of these minerals has been rising.
2832280	2838120	So a lot of the 2022 price spikes and everything
2838120	2841720	have come off of the highs, including inflation overall.
2841720	2843800	Inflation is still at a 40-year high.
2843800	2845640	In fact, it's a 50-year high,
2845640	2847560	but it's below the peak of last summer.
2848280	2850440	Mineral prices similarly are still at highs.
2850440	2853000	They're about, depending on the basket you choose,
2853000	2854840	but the kind of metals that go into batteries,
2854840	2857480	electric cars, nickel, copper, aluminum,
2857480	2860040	they're all about 200% to 300% more expensive
2860040	2860920	than five years ago.
2861640	2865480	Aluminum is at multi-decade highs still.
2865480	2869400	The lithium is still, instead of being 1,800% more expensive,
2869400	2873960	it's only 900% more expensive than it was five years ago.
2873960	2876360	So all the minerals and metals are going into
2876360	2878680	making electric vehicles and solar arrays
2878680	2880040	have become more expensive,
2880040	2882520	which is driving up the cost of those machines.
2882520	2885080	So the last year and this year and next year,
2885800	2887320	batteries are getting more expensive,
2887320	2889960	have got more expensive, wind turbines are got more expensive,
2889960	2891080	are going to get more expensive.
2891640	2895080	Same with solar and all of them have the same characteristic.
2895080	2900840	They all depend for their price forecasts
2900840	2904360	on the availability and price of the input minerals and metals.
2904360	2908040	So the most important thing that's being missed
2908040	2912040	in all the ambitious plans to make this energy transition
2912600	2915480	is acknowledgement that every one of the plans,
2915480	2918680	there's no exception, all plans in all countries,
2919400	2921400	all the aspirants to this transition,
2922040	2925160	a certain belief that the costs of these machines
2925160	2928200	will get cheaper, not a little bit, by a lot in the future.
2928200	2931480	All of them are asserting and model all of their forecasts
2931480	2933640	on every declining costs for electric cars,
2933640	2935800	their batteries, windmills and solar arrays.
2937000	2944120	That model, those claims are profoundly and completely dependent
2944120	2945640	on the cost of the metals and minerals.
2946280	2949400	And about that, I would take the bet.
2949400	2950760	Those are not going to go down,
2950760	2953160	but I just want to know on what basis they're assuming
2953160	2955960	these things will get cheaper at the rate that they're claiming.
2955960	2961160	That is, put differently, for the battery to go down by 50% in price,
2962200	2965160	electric car batteries about $10,000 to make, roughly.
2966200	2967720	So for it to become,
2967720	2969880	and that's about what the average price premium is
2969880	2972200	for electric car over conventional car.
2972920	2976680	This roughly, setting aside the really expensive high-end cars
2976680	2978600	which comprise 5% of market.
2978600	2981000	We're talking about the cars that people drive every day,
2981000	2985400	the $22,000 Nissan, the $22,000 Toyota.
2985400	2987400	To make that an electric vehicle,
2987400	2990280	you basically increase its cost by $8,000 or $10,000.
2990280	2991000	The input costs.
2992040	2996040	To cost parity, the battery has to be free, essentially.
2996040	2997560	Because internal combustion engines don't cost much.
2997560	2998920	The government has to give a subsidy.
2999880	3001480	Well, okay.
3002040	3005240	But what's going on, and we've already seen this,
3005240	3006920	is when the government gives the subsidies,
3006920	3008440	the car doesn't get cheaper.
3008440	3011080	The automaker keeps the price at that,
3011080	3015000	and they raise the price and extract the benefit for themselves.
3015640	3016600	But you're right.
3016600	3018840	In principle, you could subsidize it enough to make it cheaper.
3018840	3019160	Sure.
3020840	3022360	I guess the real question is,
3022360	3025240	what percentage of cars are governments willing to subsidize?
3025240	3026440	100% of them, apparently,
3026440	3029880	because if we ban internal combustion engines entirely,
3030680	3033720	unless the electric car gets cheaper,
3034760	3037400	then we're going to have to subsidize every car everybody buys.
3037400	3039720	But Mark, do we have enough minerals in the world
3041400	3042200	to make these cars?
3042200	3051560	Or do we have enough copper to replace 1.4 billion light vehicles throughout the world?
3052360	3053240	Yes, Howard.
3054200	3056440	The question has to be phrased carefully,
3056440	3059880	because for this reason, and this is not to criticize you, Charles,
3059880	3062120	is because the answer to the question,
3062120	3064520	are there enough minerals in the world, is unequivocally yes.
3065160	3069080	Because I've been accused recently of something that was the deepest cut
3069080	3071480	that's ever been leveled against me in my career.
3071480	3073320	I was called a Malthusian for saying
3073320	3075320	that we don't have enough minerals in the world,
3075320	3078040	as if I'm the anti-Malthusian.
3078360	3083480	Anyway, there are enough metals and minerals in the Earth's crust.
3083480	3087800	This is not, in fact, that some researchers recently at MIT put out a study
3087800	3088920	to prove the obvious.
3088920	3093240	There are enough minerals in the world to finance all cars being electric.
3093240	3094120	Yes, of course there are.
3094120	3094840	That's not the point.
3095720	3099800	The point really implicit in this is, are we now mining enough,
3100600	3105320	and are the world's mines investing in enough expansion
3105320	3108360	to provide that quantity of copper and aluminum and nickel?
3108360	3110200	And for that, we know the answer.
3110200	3112680	And again, courtesy of the International Energy Agency,
3112680	3117880	we want to have to increase the mining of things like copper by nearly 300%,
3117880	3124200	things like lithium by something about 500%, for graphite by about 800% or 1,000%.
3125320	3131720	The increase in mining required to meet this are numbers that have never been seen,
3132360	3133960	I mean, literally in modern history.
3134680	3140040	But more importantly, even if you naively thought you could expand mines that fast enough,
3140040	3143000	you would want to ask the obvious question.
3143000	3148200	Are the world's mining industries announcing plans and investments in the coming decade
3148200	3151160	that are even close to what's required?
3151160	3155000	And there are businesses that follow this stuff, Reistad does.
3156360	3158440	There are mining analysts that follow this stuff.
3158440	3160920	Wood McKenzie has put out very good data on this.
3161640	3167880	Roughly speaking, the world's mining industry is investing about 10% of what's required
3167880	3171880	to meet 2330 goals, 10% of what's required.
3171880	3177320	Or put differently, we're going to miss the availability of the metals to make enough
3177320	3180120	electric vehicles by 2030 by a factor of 10.
3180120	3181480	Amazing.
3181480	3182600	Absolutely amazing.
3182600	3188040	And by the way, just to close with this, even if we got rid of all of the 1.4
3188040	3191320	billion light vehicles on the road today that suck up gas,
3191960	3194200	what are we saving in the world's fuel consumption?
3194200	3197400	Because like you said, the fuel is going to have to go somewhere.
3197400	3200760	We're going to need fuel in order to make all these other things.
3200760	3202360	So what would be the net savings?
3203640	3207720	If you could wave the wand, which we sort of did with lockdowns.
3207720	3209960	We stopped people from driving as much.
3209960	3215240	If you could wave the wand, you could eliminate about a quarter of the world's oil use.
3215320	3220280	If you did overnight, no more driving of internal combustion engine vehicles,
3220280	3221720	like duty vehicles, small trucks.
3223320	3227160	From a viewpoint of overall hydrocarbon use, oil, gas, and coal combined,
3229160	3232520	your total reduction is about 7% of the world's hydrocarbon use.
3232520	3235240	But remember, the wand waving is not happening.
3235240	3237080	We're looking at 20 years.
3237080	3241240	20 years from now, the increased consumption of oil for the mining machinery,
3241240	3246040	for aviation, for heavy trucks and delivery, shipping, all the other factors
3246040	3251880	would mean that even if you could get to 100% electric vehicle penetration 20 years from now,
3251880	3259080	you would eliminate, by my estimation, about 12 to 15% of the world's oil use at that time.
3259080	3260120	So that's something.
3261240	3262280	It's a lot of oil.
3262280	3266840	But the more important question that you'd have to ask if your strategist or an analyst is,
3267720	3269720	who's producing the other 80% to 90%?
3269720	3270520	Where's it coming from?
3270920	3273240	Who's investing in that?
3273240	3274760	Well, you know, OPEC is.
3274760	3276760	Russia will continue to do that.
3277320	3281640	China is investing in oil and gas expansion in their country and offshore on their shores.
3281640	3283080	I saw the last eight quarters.
3283720	3290120	On average, the U.S. oil industry has not been spending in due to the administration
3290120	3294280	and political risk into capital expenditures and to drilling.
3294280	3295160	So that's eight quarters.
3295160	3297000	So our supply is greatly lagged.
3297000	3299160	And suppose you put a big frame around this.
3299160	3303400	We're talking about 100 million barrels a day is what we're sucking up, right?
3303400	3306840	So even if the world consumes 100 million barrels a day,
3306840	3311240	so even 30 years, let's say 20 years out, so with 10% reduction,
3311240	3314680	we're still going to be using 90 million barrels or so a day at the best.
3314680	3315240	But who knows?
3315240	3318200	Maybe we'll 80%, 80 million.
3318200	3319480	It's not zero.
3319480	3321560	Anyone who thinks it's zero is.
3321560	3322440	Well, that's the problem.
3322440	3328520	Even if you imagine the scenario is wildly optimistic as you get to all,
3329320	3334280	in fact, electric cars are at price parity or subsidized to be a price parity.
3334280	3337000	And you get you get rid of 20 million barrels per day of oil.
3337640	3341080	You still have to produce at least 80 if nothing else grows.
3341720	3345160	And since other things will grow, you're still going to have to produce closer to 90
3345160	3346520	million barrels per day.
3346520	3349960	So the question that's important because it's only 20 years away that we're going to
3349960	3353160	force this quote transition, it's back to where we started.
3353160	3355640	This is not a transition, right?
3355640	3358120	This is not a transition away from oil use.
3358840	3361480	It's a reduction in oil use, even if it were to happen.
3361480	3365560	But it's not a transition away from the need for hydrocarbons.
3365560	3369480	And to make it apolitical, to your point under this administration's
3369480	3373800	hostility to oil and gas, which has been moderated by the president's
3373800	3380840	intemperate off-script remarks, okay, I'll give him credit for doing it because
3380840	3384040	he had to have been realizing as soon as he started saying it what he was saying.
3384040	3389320	He's not, whatever other people think, he's pretty aware of what he's saying.
3389320	3394200	He may have loose lips, but a lot of presidents have had loose lips when they're talking.
3395320	3400840	Here's the thing is that it's not just under this presidency or the previous presidency
3400840	3402840	where it was much more enthusiasm, oil and gas.
3402840	3406680	But if we look at the global oil and gas industry, so we get out of the United States
3407240	3413000	and we look at the behaviors of capital markets broadly where the investments come from both
3413560	3419400	both the private markets, private banks, and public banks, if you like, the international
3419400	3424440	banking system, especially the European banking system, it's been hostile to oil and gas investment
3424440	3431240	for about 15 years. And so if we charted the total capital expenditures of the oil and gas
3431240	3440200	industry globally in new production, it started going down like off a cliff 15 years ago.
3440200	3444360	And then when COVID hit and then this president was elected, the combination
3444360	3452440	accelerated down. So we're now at epic lows that began, predates US lack of enthusiasm,
3452440	3458280	let's call it. Let's give the administration credit for giving a permit to Conoco Phillips
3458280	3465880	for dealing in Alaska, even though the jury is out as whether or not they've also put it into place,
3466840	3471640	we'll call it the expedite rules or at least arbitration rules so that they can get it built
3471640	3476360	as quickly as they built the original oil production in Alaska. So they don't, it's just
3476360	3480360	it'll never get built under litigation. So that should bring in 180,000 barrels
3480360	3486520	when that's up and running. But it's a huge fine, right? I mean, a really productive
3487720	3493000	shale well, and that's like putting a couple hundred really productive shale wells in place
3493080	3499560	all at once. I mean, it's a big deal when they get it going. So we have this general
3499560	3504600	antipathy in the investment world, private and public, and a lot of social and public pressure,
3504600	3510120	a lot of overt pressure, not to invest net new money in oil and gas globally. And it's had the
3510120	3515560	effect that was intended. The investment's gone down. It's had the effect. And the fact that
3515560	3519560	sort of everybody knows if you're an analyst, but it's, you don't have to understand the
3519560	3526600	only gas industry to know this important fact. You have to, just like food, you have to plant
3526600	3530840	crops every year. In the oil and gas business, when you consume energy from oil from a well
3530840	3537080	or gas, the well eventually is exhausted. It's capacity. So you have to plant new,
3537880	3542600	the exploration each year and development is the equivalent of planting new food each year.
3542600	3547560	And we know the decline rate, the global decline rate for all the world's oil wells. If we stopped
3547640	3552440	investing in new ones tomorrow with the zero, every year we'd have about six or seven million
3552440	3558200	barrels per day less oil available to the world. So we'll put differently. We have to
3558200	3567880	find and put into production oil output pretty close to what Texas does every year globally.
3569000	3572680	Without making a prediction, because I know that's not what you're doing. I hate predictions,
3573240	3579400	my episodically get into the game of predicting. I get trapped into and
3579400	3584040	have to make predictions the case that we all do. This is simple economics 101.
3584040	3589880	Supply is shrinking and being crimped and not being replaced even at the rate of seven million
3589880	3594600	barrels a year. We're consuming, even if we stay at 100 million, but we know that's not the case.
3594600	3599800	China was reopening, India, other development countries want the same benefits we all have
3599800	3605880	is electricity 24-7 or the availability of that. No brownouts on that. Even if that stays the same,
3605880	3611560	we're in a situation the way I see it, where five years or so from now, how could oil prices not be
3611560	3618040	higher? Yeah, I think if you know, the thing about oil prices is if you're really good at
3618040	3622520	predicting them, especially in the mid-short-term, you're a very wealthy person, as we all know.
3622520	3628440	It's true for all commodities. So commodities are impacted by lots of variables, but with
3628440	3635880	oil it's easy. Oil is still utterly deeply tied to our economy, first of all, since to state an
3635880	3642520	obvious fact, 98% of all the world's movement of goods and people is moved by burning oil,
3643080	3651960	98%. And if you get all the EVs to happen in the next 20 years, maybe you get it down to 90%.
3652920	3659320	So the world moves people and goods, things we need and things we want by burning oil.
3660200	3667400	So if you have a recession, people move less and buy less stuff. So you're reduced to, in
3667400	3671800	simplistic terms, moving only the essentials, food and things you have to have and have to
3671800	3676680	replace. You just put everything off. So a really deep recession can really, really put off the
3676760	3681640	day of reckoning. And I think we're on track for a recession. I'm not a great predictor of
3681640	3687640	things, but given inflation and interest rates and market psychology and the banking challenges,
3687640	3692040	it sort of feels like we're already in a mild recession, at least. The world doesn't like
3692040	3697720	recessions. The world always comes out of recessions. Even the Great Depression, we came out of it
3697720	3705800	eventually. So the bet you're making to your point is whenever the recession is however long we delay
3705800	3713160	the oil-consuming impact of growth again, because all growth, including the enthusiastic world,
3713160	3718040	will result in more oil demand, not less. For the near future, let's forget whether we're
3718040	3722840	going to have 20 or 30 years. So for the near five years or so. Yeah, five, 10 year future.
3722840	3727080	So this is what you would look at. You'd look at the decline curve and the investment numbers.
3727080	3732760	And those are two public numbers. The decline curve we know, the investment's down. So we know
3732760	3740680	for a fact that a day in the not distant future could be 18 months, could be as soon as 18 months.
3741880	3745560	If we dodge a really bad recession, it could happen. If it's a geopolitical event,
3745560	3750600	it could be even sooner. So who knows? Can I give you a scenario? Here's an
3750600	3759320	optimist scenario, the pessimistic outcome. Peace breaks out in Ukraine and Putin leaves
3759320	3765480	office, doesn't have a heart attack, he retires, he's deposed, whatever. So that Russia gets out of
3765480	3772200	the penalty box and the world wants to buy its oil and gas again. Here's a factor that's not being
3772760	3777800	threaded into the discussion about future oil prices. Russia is one of the world's biggest
3777800	3783080	oil exporters. They export 7 million barrels per day. They export much more than we do. They are
3783080	3789160	like OPEC, the big dogs in oil export. But their oil is being sold at about a 40% discount to market.
3789720	3794120	Because they're in the penalty box. We sanctioned them so everybody else is buying a discount.
3794120	3799560	If you're, you don't have to again be an oil trader or an economist to know, if for the first time in
3799560	3805240	history, the biggest, one of the biggest exporters of a commodity in the world market
3805800	3810440	has having to sell its stuff for a 40% off of prevailing price, that has dragged the world
3810440	3816280	price down. If you add to that a mild recession, which is where we're sitting, if you get growth,
3816280	3819720	so growth will come back if peace breaks out in part because people be enthusiastic,
3819720	3826440	they have the spirits, all which would be great. Let's pray Xi negotiates a piece, pray that Putin
3826440	3831960	is exits the world stage in some fashion that we're all comfortable with, whatever that is.
3832840	3837960	And oil demand goes up and they start trading oil in the market again. Wow.
3837960	3839400	But the real price.
3839400	3845080	It just do the math here. I mean, take 7 million barrels per day, which gets you to sort of a
3846040	3850760	what's that about 3 billion barrels of oil a year going at a discount of 30 to $4 a barrel.
3850760	3858360	So there's a $100 billion a year discount in oil going on now because of the current price, right?
3858360	3863640	That's reflected on the current price. I mean, you could argue it's a good thing that there's
3863640	3870360	less money flowing to potentates who sell oil, including Putin. We're doing fine and miss record
3870360	3873960	profits for Exxon and the shale guys are making a lot of money at these prices.
3874520	3880040	But the bigger economic and political question and the one out of scare politicians witless
3880680	3883240	is growth comes back and peace breaks out.
3885080	3889240	What we don't want, and this is what I think Chairman Powell knows, by the way,
3889240	3896760	I think he's a very smart guy, when he answered a question that he was put to him last week and
3896760	3900840	Senate hearings about inflation and the tool he has, which is interest rates.
3901560	3905000	We're talking about what the other things are that might push inflation. Well,
3905000	3911000	the Federal Reserve has published pretty good academic papers on the other things like systemic
3911000	3916360	increase in commodity prices, not an episodic increase. If you push oil back to $100 a barrel,
3916360	3920760	leave it there for, I don't know, four or five years instead of four or five months.
3921560	3927800	I mean, this is inflationary. If it's high enough, it creates recessions by itself.
3928360	3932360	This is when we had our high oil prices, it acts like a tax on the American people.
3933160	3933800	It is a tax revenue.
3933800	3937320	Driving your car, you have to now figure out if I'm traveling 50 miles a day to work,
3937320	3941560	it's going to cost you X percent more. And I remember back last year in February time,
3942440	3947480	there were calculations that I don't remember ever thinking about and hearing about that I heard
3947480	3952520	in the 70s of, well, I only could fill up today and here's what it cost. All of a sudden energy
3952520	3956520	became a big factor and I'm in New York and I'm seeing what my gas bills are,
3957240	3962680	my natural gas bill each month and my electric bill, they've gone through the roof. And this is at
3962680	3970440	a discounted price of crude oil. Amazing. So let's use the language that everybody now understands
3970440	3975000	if they read papers, systemic risk, right? That when you have policies that create
3975000	3981560	quote systemic risk, so what do we do with the policy of zero percent money? We create an
3981560	3986280	systemic risk inflation. When you inflate the cost of money, you have a systemic risk and you end
3986280	3994600	up with bank failures. So we understand the bludgeoning of markets with ham-handed tools that
3994600	4002360	have systemic impacts create systemic risks. So let me just use that language. When you create
4003400	4008360	an environment in which the world is underinvesting in its primary source of moving goods and
4008360	4016840	people, oil, you've created a systemic risk and that systemic risk is calculable. We know
4017640	4023240	we have lots of data, just like in the financial markets, what happens if you create an environment
4023240	4029160	at which the markets demand for oil exceeds its supply systemically, not because there's a brief
4029160	4034360	war in the Middle East. This is a long-term trend and that's what I've been going over my
4034360	4040200	numbers and looking at this for the past year and I'm saying myself, how could oil not be higher
4040200	4046360	five years from now? I'm glad you just laid out the facts. Mark, we've got to have you on again.
4046360	4051000	I can speak to you for hours and hours and hours, folks. Mark Mills, the name of his latest book,
4051000	4055000	really definitely worth reading, even though it's, let me just say the name of it, the Cloud
4055000	4060520	Revolution, how the convergence of new technologies will unleash the next economic boom in our roaring
4060600	4066280	2020s is a fantastic, I think about six or 70 pages there about energy in that book.
4066280	4073080	Yeah, really great stuff. Well worth reading and I think it's really enlightening because you
4073080	4078600	go into research and everyone talks about but no one thinks about. I appreciate that. I mean,
4080520	4084840	I guess the reason I'm frustrated at us creating systemic risk of high cost energy
4084840	4088760	is that we're sitting on the cusp as I try to outline in my book, as you know,
4088760	4094520	of one of the greatest economic expansion opportunities in the century and growth brings
4094520	4099160	energy demand. If you make energy expensive, you constrain the growth. It's not that it
4099160	4104840	will never happen, is that you push it off in time and of course we all know time value amounting
4104840	4108360	money matters. I mean, if somebody tells you, I'm going to give you a raise in 10 years,
4108360	4113560	you're not as happy as getting a smaller raise tomorrow. Amazing. For obvious reasons.
4113560	4118120	All right, Mark, I want to thank you once again, man. Best of luck to you and keep doing the great
4118120	4124200	work that you do. I follow you when you're speaking on YouTube. You write tons of papers
4124200	4127960	and really amazing stuff. Keep going for the next 20 years.
4130200	4136280	Thank you. Thanks. Good to be on and as you know, my podcast is The Last Optimist. I'm still
4136280	4140120	a stubborn optimist. Oh yeah, Last Optimist by the way, folks. Definitely worth listening to.
