1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
And there is no transition going on in the energy markets.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,480
It's just not visible in the data.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,040
So in my world also data, data matters.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,200
And the idea that we're in the middle of an accelerating transition is not showing up

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,200
in the data.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:25,040
In fact, if we then go one step further and talk about aspirations, which is the aspiration,

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,200
that's when you get to the delusion.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,960
My guest today is Mark Mills.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,880
Mark is a physicist, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and was named energy

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,120
writer of the year by the American Energy Society.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,720
He has written several award-winning books, including his latest, The Cloud Revolution,

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,920
and The Convergence of New Technologies will unleash the next economic boom and a roaring

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,480
2020s.

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,800
The Binding Administration plans to eliminate fossil fuels as a form of energy generation

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,080
in the U.S. by 2035.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,720
Not so, says Mark.

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,560
I recently sat down with him and he shared with me why the administration's transition

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,520
to green energy is a delusion, in fact, impossible.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:16,000
And here we are going to need fossil fuel for at least the next several decades.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,800
Mark, thanks so much for coming on the show.

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Greatly appreciated.

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
This is your second time.

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,320
I remember the first time you came, it was about a year ago or so.

24
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,320
It seems like yesterday.

25
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,320
Yeah.

26
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
It's our anniversary.

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Anniversary.

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,560
We're going to have to get a cake.

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,560
What's the first anniversary?

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,560
What is that?

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
I think paper or something.

32
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,560
I don't know.

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,560
Okay.

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,560
I know.

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,560
You didn't send me any flowers, any any chocolates.

36
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
I got nothing.

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
I got buckets.

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
Wait till after.

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
Wait till after the show.

40
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
All right.

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,480
So you were on the show about a year ago, and you totally enlightened me as to fossil

42
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,280
fuels, EVs, green energy.

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,960
And I remember at the time you just went through, because you just went right through with how

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,680
green energy isn't so green or clean, especially when we talk about electric vehicles.

45
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,200
So before we even begin, before we even begin, I want to bring you back to the state of the

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,440
union address.

47
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,440
President Biden is giving the state of the union, it was February 7th, so not too long

48
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
ago.

49
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,360
And he goes totally off script.

50
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
It's not on the transcript.

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
It's not anywhere.

52
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,320
He says, we are still going to need oil and gas for a while.

53
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,640
And then he tells a little anecdote, an oil executive asked him why his company, why his

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,040
company should invest in fossil fuel projects in light of the negative business atmosphere

55
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,000
for oil and gas projects.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,480
And Biden responded, we're going to need oil for at least another decade and beyond.

57
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,760
You coined this a while ago, the energy transition delusion.

58
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,680
Tell me why.

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,640
Well, in the world that I live in, and this is not universal, not universal, I like to

60
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,120
believe words have meaning.

61
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:02,820
So I sort of, let's start with, and I recognize that words are elastic and we change their

62
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,320
meanings over time.

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,160
But usually it takes a long time.

64
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,400
So a transition means going from something from one place to another, it's a transition.

65
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,160
There is no transition going on in the energy markets.

66
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,120
It's just not visible in the data.

67
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,680
So in my world also data matters.

68
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,840
And the idea that we're in the middle of an accelerating transition is not showing up

69
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
in the data.

70
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:34,640
In fact, if we then go one step further and talk about aspirations, which is the aspiration,

71
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,400
that's when you get to the delusion.

72
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,840
It's not just that it's delusional to call this a transition because there isn't one.

73
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,200
And to restate what I mean by that is we're 20 years into what we could call the era of

74
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,920
climate awareness, at least 20 years into it.

75
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,160
The Western world was spent directly about $5 trillion, and I believe probably indirectly

76
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,160
another $5 trillion.

77
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,360
Well, let's say rounded up to about $10 trillion to avoid using hydrocarbons over the last

78
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,880
20 years.

79
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,760
And the share of the world's energy coming from hydrocarbons has indeed gone down in

80
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
those 20 years.

81
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,520
It's gone down from 86% to 84%.

82
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,120
So that doesn't look like a rapid transition after $20 trillion of spending.

83
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,520
It doesn't look like a transition.

84
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:24,040
In fact, it's not a transition because over that same time period, the quantity of hydrocarbons

85
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,000
consumed in absolute terms has gone up, and to put it in sort of relative terms has gone

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,760
up by a quantity equal to adding 5 or 6 Saudi Arabia's worth of oil production in terms

87
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,880
of energy equivalent.

88
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,720
So that's the world's using more of everything, so that's not a transition.

89
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,960
That's a feel like, you know, the better word to be transformation, we're adding new

90
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,240
form of energy to the broad energy mix, which is a lot of windmills and solar arrays.

91
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
This is true.

92
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,720
We're adding new kinds of machines like electric vehicles.

93
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720
This is also indisputably true, and then we're going to add lots more of them.

94
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,400
But that's not a transition.

95
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,960
In fact, all of history, the development of new ways of producing and delivering energy

96
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,440
to society have been additive.

97
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,160
In fact, there's a sort of last point that I made many times I should make again.

98
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,760
It's not that I like windmills.

99
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,440
I've been in wind farms that stress the horizon in China.

100
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
I think they're oppressive.

101
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,360
I like solar arrays.

102
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,160
In a way, my first patent was a solar device.

103
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,120
It actually was a photo detector for guiding missiles, but I was a cold warrior back in

104
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,440
the day, so I like the technology.

105
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,200
I think I understand the technology.

106
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm a fan of the technology.

107
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,160
If I were making a prediction today, I would say that the share of the world's energy coming

108
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,840
from wind and solar in the coming decade will at least double, at least setting aside all

109
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,520
the money being thrown at it foolishly.

110
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,760
Even without that, we're going to increase the use of it because it's more cost effective

111
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,760
than it ever was.

112
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,200
So it has an enormous role, really important.

113
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:58,240
But here we are today, to make the point again, all this excitement about wind and solar.

114
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:05,320
As of right now, after trillions of spending, wind and solar combined provide the world

115
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,560
one third as much energy as burning wood globally, burning wood.

116
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,440
Wood is the oldest energy source known to man.

117
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,880
We still get triple the energy globally from burning wood than we do from wind and solar

118
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,960
combined.

119
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,040
That's not because wind and solar won't take over wood.

120
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,920
It has an America finally.

121
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,840
So we now get twice to three times more energy from wind and solar than we do from burning

122
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,840
wood.

123
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,840
But it just takes time.

124
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,880
It costs a lot of money.

125
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:36,720
So the point of the delusion language is not meant to be an invective, although I guess

126
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,160
it's obviously provocative.

127
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,760
It's not there in the data where we are.

128
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,000
And the more difficult thing to answer is, well, why can't we get there?

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,400
I mean, so we heard it from the president.

130
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,000
In a, I guess you could call it a form of social Tourette's, maybe.

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,240
I mean, I'm not sure why Trump had social Tourette's even more epically than this president.

132
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,480
Any president goes off script.

133
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,480
So he says something that he has to know is true.

134
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,280
And his energy secretary has since he said that off script remark, been running around

135
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,040
the country, repeating that statement, actually went to the biggest energy conference in the

136
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:21,720
world is zero week that my friends, Dan Jurgen, you know, pioneered and created down in Houston.

137
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,400
And it brings people from all over the world and all forms of energy, not just oil and

138
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
gas.

139
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,680
She went there, secretary of energy, said, again, we're going to need oil and gas for

140
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,260
a long time yet.

141
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:37,960
And she sort of modified that, not just 10 years, when the reason she modified it with

142
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,760
sort of more open ended, how long we'll need it is obvious.

143
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,880
If you thought, if you thought as a business, pretend it's your money, that you have to

144
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,520
make multi-billion dollar investments today and the government is going to ban your product

145
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,720
in 10 years.

146
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Would you make those investments?

147
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Well, of course not.

148
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,480
And of course, the current level of investing oil and gas is at a epic, if cyclical low,

149
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,560
maybe lower than in relative terms than it's ever been in modern modern history.

150
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,920
And why, why, why are the investments down?

151
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,600
Is it because the oil and gas industry is afraid of competition?

152
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,880
I don't think they're afraid of competition.

153
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,160
What they're afraid of is regulation and taxation.

154
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,560
And so you slow down and wait to see when things calm down and being simplistic, there

155
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
are lots of factors.

156
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,040
But if you're on a board and you're sort of thinking about these things, you know, you're

157
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:32,680
making a lot of money now at current prices, even if even the current soften prices.

158
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,680
What's the hurry?

159
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,360
Let's just wait and see how things settle out and see what, if they're serious, I mean,

160
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,760
I guess I would.

161
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,800
This, by the way, this, this is already the same phenomenon as already in playing out

162
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,840
in utility scale wind and solar where investments are down as subsidies get complicated.

163
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:57,040
Nobody knows what the rules are as in as real costs have risen both for the costs of the

164
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:05,000
machines and as the financing costs have risen because of interest rates and as uncertainties

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,280
have risen with respect to if you're the developer going to put billions to work, you

166
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,600
might, you might begin to worry about the tolerance of markets to high cost energy.

167
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:21,440
And one of the things that is sort of central to the trope of the energy transition is that

168
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,600
wind and solar are cheaper.

169
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,240
That's just central to the thesis.

170
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,120
It's baked into every forecast.

171
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,560
And yet there is no jurisdiction in the world, in Europe or United States, no state and no

172
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,240
country in which the increased penetration of wind and solar has led to reduced utility

173
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,400
grid costs have all been associated with higher costs.

174
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:49,800
So if they're cheaper and we're at epic levels of spending, I'm waiting for the cheaper power

175
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,520
if you're a consumer and the inverses happen.

176
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,720
So I think, you know, cooler minds setting aside the hyperbole around all this stuff and

177
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,240
the anxiety about why we have to do this, which is beyond obvious what the motivations are.

178
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:13,480
You know, the combination of scale imposing real costs, the combination of the exposure of

179
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,400
the fragility of energy systems that the Ukraine invasion illustrated, because what Europe did

180
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,000
was build a more economically and structurally fragile energy system.

181
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,600
And by that I mean both by depending on an unreliable source of cheap energy, but also

182
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,120
failing to build in their own borders, reliable sources of cheap energy.

183
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,320
Right.

184
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,280
So all of this, let me, you packed up, you threw out a lot of great information there.

185
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:46,920
I just want to go back to one thing, that the Biden administration was talking about being,

186
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,600
going to zero missions, totally green energy out at 2035 or 2050.

187
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,520
All those dates really have been thrown out the window.

188
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,920
They were just dates probably just to get out there, right?

189
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,600
The numbers and the facts and the data didn't support any of that, right?

190
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,520
No, there's no, there's, I think what we have is the Energy Information Administration,

191
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,640
which is the Department of Energy's, I mean, tautological information agency.

192
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,200
It's pretty, it's pretty apolitical.

193
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,360
They've been very good over the, over the decades in providing data based on what's

194
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,480
actually happening as opposed to policy aspirations.

195
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,280
Their goal is not to make the policy, but to make forecasts, report data.

196
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,600
Make forecasts based on stated policy.

197
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,600
And they just issued their latest analysis and they show that pushing out to 2030, 2035, 2040,

198
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,520
we don't get anywhere near zero missions.

199
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,920
If you implement everything in the Inflation Reduction Act,

200
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,200
set aside the Orwellian name for that, but all the spending, which is hundreds of billions,

201
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,600
literally probably direct spending and mandated spending.

202
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,640
Cause a lot of these things have mandates that are off book spending.

203
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,160
So there's probably a trillion dollars of spending in the two pieces of legislation,

204
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:05,240
Infrastructure Act, Inflation Reduction Act on wind solar transmission and electric cars.

205
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,760
And what you get is, you know, something like 15 to 20% reduction in US CO2 emissions by

206
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,840
2040 or so, which, okay, I mean, that's not zero, but it's not zero missions.

207
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,560
And more importantly, as the EIA points out, and now there's this, that reduction,

208
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,680
which is about a gigatonic carbon dioxide, by the way,

209
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:29,400
we've already gone down about a gigatonic carbon dioxide in the last 20 years,

210
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,680
mostly because of the cheap shale gas replacing coal, of course.

211
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,960
But that's wiped out by three to four years of increased coal consumption

212
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,880
in China alone, never mind India, Indonesia and other places.

213
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
So there's, there's sort of this bizarre,

214
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,160
it's almost surreal ignoring of what's going, really going on in the world.

215
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,640
Which is CO2 emissions are going up as countries expand and chase energy that's cheap.

216
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:03,720
And the CO2 emissions reductions coming in the United States come at staggering costs

217
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,040
and have no effect on the overall global trends.

218
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:16,440
And even Bill Gates at the last great gathering that gets vilified in Davos,

219
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,800
gave a, you know, private interview and talked about all this stuff.

220
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,640
And he, and he said, and I don't think I'm gonna get the quote wrong.

221
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,920
So two things that are important.

222
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:31,000
One is that even if we get to zero emissions by 2050, he doesn't think we can.

223
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,000
Things we have to try, obviously he said that a lot, but we're not going to.

224
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,840
But even if we got there, then that would not mean that the world's warming won't continue.

225
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,680
The models would show the world will continue to warm roughly as much as the models purport

226
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,400
it will do now.

227
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,120
Whether you believe the models or not, it's not the point.

228
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,760
The models don't show any material change going out for the next century after that,

229
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,480
even if we spend that kind of money.

230
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,080
The thing that really bothers me, what animates most of my work is not,

231
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,400
it's not just that it's a delusionary to think that we can get rid of hydrocarbons quickly.

232
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:08,920
Not never.

233
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,000
Never is different than quickly, but quickly meaning in the foreseeable future in decades

234
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,880
is that the cost of doing this is economically and socially destructive.

235
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,480
It is, in my view, immoral.

236
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,320
And it's immoral for this reason.

237
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:32,040
The whole world has, really all of history, pursued the goal of increasing wealth

238
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,520
for the maximum number of people, increasing productivity.

239
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,640
Productivity is always defined very simplistically, but 100% accurately,

240
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,880
getting more outputs for fewer inputs of dollars, labor and materials.

241
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,080
The energy transition aspirations get the same outputs, if you're lucky,

242
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,200
with increased inputs of dollars, labor and materials.

243
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,320
This is, it puts more simply, this is wealth destroying.

244
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,320
And at the scales we're talking about, I don't mean having a few percent of electricity

245
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,720
from wind and solar and 100 million electric cars, that's irrelevant.

246
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,160
It's in the noise, frankly.

247
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,840
But the scales imagined, it's profoundly wealth destroying.

248
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,160
And the people who are impacted by that are not the wealthy.

249
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,320
So the wealthy are less wealthy.

250
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,240
Okay, no one cares.

251
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,360
It's the wealth destruction of the middle class and the people who are poor.

252
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,840
It's indescribably offensive to me to have a path that's doing that,

253
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,160
which is not the same as saying, because it always gets, one label is all,

254
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,880
then you don't care about what we have to try to do.

255
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,680
I care about changing energy systems.

256
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,560
I may not agree with you.

257
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,760
It was like, it's like an interrupter.

258
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,240
I haven't met anyone who would say they're pro-pollution.

259
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,840
They want more pollution in the future.

260
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,120
We're all on the same side.

261
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,000
It's just, as you mentioned, how much it's going to cost

262
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,800
and how much benefit are we going to get for each dollar spent?

263
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:07,080
It's beyond obvious the money matters, or symmetrically follow the money,

264
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,840
as the old ad is about saying who benefits from different policies.

265
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,200
But here's the problem.

266
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,400
It's not only is the rest of the world increasing its carbon dioxide emissions

267
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,600
as the West tries to reduce it at extraordinarily high costs.

268
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,840
It's that it's not doing what people claim.

269
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,240
I mean, it's dishonest, intellectually dishonest,

270
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,760
to pretend, for example, the electric cars are zero emissions.

271
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,240
They're not.

272
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,520
They're elsewhere emissions.

273
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:36,680
What you'd want to know is how much the emissions are today

274
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,760
and how much they will be in the future as you push harder on getting more EVs in the market

275
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,440
to result in the higher emissions to make the vehicles.

276
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,120
Obviously, it offsets emissions from combusting gasoline.

277
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,480
This is beyond obvious and infantile observation,

278
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,600
but it's not zero emissions.

279
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,680
It's other place emissions.

280
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,800
People know that reflexively when you say it.

281
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,360
I mean, they say, OK, yeah, well, I have to have a power plant

282
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,920
and everybody jokes about how the power plant could be coal fired.

283
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,040
Well, that's no joke.

284
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,160
I mean, it depends.

285
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,680
It depends on where you charge the car.

286
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,160
And when you charge the car, how you're filling that battery up.

287
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,560
I mean, this may be obvious, but it's most of the calculations that purport

288
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,640
an electric vehicle is zero emissions are based on average emissions from a grid.

289
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,720
Well, there's no average.

290
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,400
There's no average emissions in filling the vehicle.

291
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,400
When the vehicle is fueled is when the emissions occur.

292
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,320
So if you fuel the vehicle at night in some parts of the United States,

293
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,120
you're filling it with hydro hydro electricity in other places.

294
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,560
Let me just let me just drill down on this.

295
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,800
And so we're on the same page and our listeners could get this.

296
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,040
True, there is nothing.

297
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,760
No emissions coming out of the vehicle.

298
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,200
But fuel.

299
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,800
There's no tailpipe.

300
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,160
So apparently there's not.

301
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,400
But fueling by plugging in your EV, you are creating emissions by.

302
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:01,800
Somewhere.

303
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,240
Electricity.

304
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:03,720
Making power.

305
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,240
Which doesn't come from magic dust.

306
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,520
No.

307
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:12,280
So you would and the EV focus is important because it's the preoccupation

308
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,480
of governments these days, right?

309
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,400
We've we've moved beyond mandating 100% wind and solar.

310
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,840
That's sort of old news and we can't get there fast enough.

311
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,680
So we have the grids that we have.

312
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,960
Grids take time to build out.

313
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,560
But it gets that there's lots more wind and solar on grids,

314
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,440
depending where you live.

315
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,440
The most is in Texas.

316
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,840
The second most is in the midcontinent of the United States.

317
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,640
Lots of windmills.

318
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,640
How far that can go is an interesting separate discussion.

319
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,120
And they too don't have tailpipe, so to speak.

320
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,040
They don't emit anything when they're operating.

321
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,840
They do cause emissions when they get built.

322
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,880
Because windmills are built from concrete and steel,

323
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,800
which require metallurgical coal and coal and oil and natural gas to make and fabricate.

324
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,720
But you know, measured over the lifetime of the operation,

325
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,840
it emits less CO2 than burning natural gas.

326
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,240
It's true.

327
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,640
How much that costs you is what matters, not whether that's true or not.

328
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,840
But the EV has sort of become the monomaniacal preoccupation.

329
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,440
I think at last count, I think there's now a dozen states.

330
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,520
The number may have gone up in the last month.

331
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,680
I think the state of Maryland, where I live,

332
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,200
as the governor said they're going to pledge,

333
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,240
a dozen states that are proposing by 2035 or 2040,

334
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,480
depending on the state, to utterly ban the sale of internal combustion engines completely.

335
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,120
I think the number of countries that have made such proclamations or planned to make them

336
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,080
is now the dozens.

337
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,400
So this is all predicated entirely on that these are zero emissions vehicles.

338
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,760
That's the entire predication.

339
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,200
I want you to hang on right there.

340
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,600
I want you to hang on right there because when we spoke last time,

341
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,320
you pointed out, I said, Charles, these cars don't show up in the showroom by magic.

342
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,920
It took something to get there.

343
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,320
And you pointed me in the direction of Volkswagen,

344
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,080
and who had it on their site, which showed the crossover between an EV and a,

345
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,680
I think it was a diesel powered car.

346
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,720
I'm not sure what their thing was.

347
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,200
Right.

348
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,240
Yeah, it was diesel.

349
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,440
Close to seven years before the 70,000 miles.

350
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,480
70,000 miles, right?

351
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,240
Which is 10,000 miles a year, let's say.

352
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,720
So you're talking about seven years on average,

353
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,720
seven years before the EV makes sense in terms of emitting CO2.

354
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,680
Is that more or less right?

355
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,120
Yeah, they're studying others.

356
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,000
They're not alone on this.

357
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,680
Volvo published a similar analysis.

358
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
So what they're doing is they're doing two things.

359
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,760
They're counting the emissions that's needed to make the EV and its battery.

360
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,480
And the emissions needed to make the internal combustion engine.

361
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:48,760
And so these are the noble processes to mine minerals at copper and aluminum

362
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,080
and refine them and assemble them into an electric vehicle.

363
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,880
And you do the same with the steel to make an internal combustion engine.

364
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,680
So you count that.

365
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,840
It's called embodied emissions or embodied energy.

366
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,200
It's our body.

367
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,560
So you count what it takes just to get the vehicle to your driveway, the emissions for that.

368
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,760
And everything has emissions associated with manufacturing because hydrocarbons are used

369
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,560
everywhere.

370
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,320
So that's the world we live in, not the world we aspire to be in in the far future.

371
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:23,560
And then you look, in the case of both these studies, at the average, back to the average,

372
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,480
is the average emissions from the electricity you have available in Europe

373
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,920
over the coming five to 10 years to operate the vehicle.

374
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,040
Because the grid that exists is the grid that you're going to use,

375
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,960
not the grid your imagined will exist in the future.

376
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,800
And yes, so what they determined is that for the first seven years of driving,

377
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,000
if you'd driven the diesel vehicle, you would have admitted less CO2

378
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,760
than if you bought the EV.

379
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,200
Because a combination of the two emissions, the battery beam,

380
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,280
the mining and the battery being fabricated, and the power plants

381
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,960
took you that long to pay off your carbon debt.

382
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,920
Now, this is important.

383
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:05,800
The Volkswagen study was based on a small EV using a battery less than half the size

384
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,760
of a Tesla battery.

385
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,720
And what was the range of that?

386
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,880
So it was a really small range on that battery, right?

387
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,320
Yeah, it's a 250-mile range.

388
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,480
But for a light vehicle, for round town use, which is a lot of people use them for,

389
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,360
that's fine, perfectly reasonable assumption.

390
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,440
But most people aren't buying those vehicles at the moment.

391
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,880
The biggest sellers are the vehicles with the big batteries in the range of three to 400 miles.

392
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,760
So, or put it differently, that means you have a battery twice as big.

393
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,960
Your carbon debt is double.

394
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,400
So the crossover point shifts out from seven years to 10 or 12 years,

395
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,480
which for most people, that's never.

396
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,320
Now, if you assume that the vehicle has a second life and in its second life,

397
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,960
it's submitting less CO2, okay.

398
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,280
But the point is the illusion that you, as the owner of that vehicle,

399
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,360
have saved CO2 is totally shattered by those assumptions.

400
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,280
Now, here's the rub.

401
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,160
We actually don't know exactly how much CO2 is emitted by a specific EV.

402
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,960
Because we don't know exactly where the materials came from for that EV.

403
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,200
We know exactly how much CO2 is emitted by an internal combustion engine vehicle,

404
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,760
because it's the same every time you fill a tank up, there's no change.

405
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,960
There's no mystery.

406
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,760
It's transparent.

407
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,400
It's obvious.

408
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,440
What we do know about the emissions associated with manufacturing an EV

409
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,200
is those emissions are going up, not down.

410
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,720
And it's not me saying this.

411
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,160
This is the International Energy Agency, International Monetary Fund,

412
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,520
the UN bodies.

413
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:35,640
This is a geological, if you like, fact that the net new ton of copper or steel or aluminum

414
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,480
or molybdenum or zinc are coming from what are called lower grade ores.

415
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,800
You'd have to dig up more rock to get the same pound or ton of metals.

416
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,680
Digging up more rock means more energy and grinding more rock more energy.

417
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,800
Let me stop you there one second.

418
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:57,800
You put in one of your papers that you have to move 500,000 pounds of dirt

419
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:04,520
in order to mine enough metals, minerals to make one, one EV battery.

420
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,360
Could you just break that down for me?

421
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,640
So the way you sort of think about this is as you start with the point,

422
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,880
how big is the fuel tank and electric vehicle?

423
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,760
If it's the one that everybody buys, not everybody, the majority that would be purchased,

424
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:25,000
they're about a half a ton or 1,000 pounds, the battery, which is a digression tells you why

425
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,160
the electric vehicle uses a lot more aluminum on average than a regular vehicle because you're

426
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,720
trying to offset what used to be an 80 pounds of gasoline with a 1,000 pound fuel tank.

427
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,280
So you offset that by more aluminum, which also causes a lot of emissions.

428
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,160
It's a very energy intensive, emissions intensive metal.

429
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,360
And that often is not included in the calculations, by the way.

430
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,640
It's just left out and ignored by some of the analysts.

431
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,360
So you have a 1,000 pound battery.

432
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,880
Then you look at the various components of the battery.

433
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,160
It's copper, it's steel, and it's aluminum.

434
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,120
Has lithium, of course, because it's a lithium-ion battery.

435
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,160
Has cobalt.

436
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,400
It has far more graphite, by the way, than it does lithium or any other element.

437
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,760
It's the most common element, and it's a very intensive

438
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,600
material to get to make all forms of lithium batteries.

439
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:20,760
And then what you do is you chase up, this is all findoutable, if you like, in Magic Google

440
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,640
Machine.

441
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,160
You could look up, what's the average ore grade for copper?

442
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,920
What was it 100 years ago or 10 years ago?

443
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,440
What's the average ore grade for aluminum?

444
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,320
The ore grade for nickel and all the different metals.

445
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:31,960
It's clean ore grade.

446
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,520
That is what?

447
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,680
So ore grade, and when I was in my impetuous youth, I worked briefly for a mining company.

448
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,160
So I have a certain affection for mining and miners.

449
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,080
I like a Canadian uranium, gold, and silver mining company.

450
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:52,760
Ore grade means the percentage of the rock that you found, or that contains the stuff you want.

451
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,160
So the richest ore grades in the metals world is iron.

452
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,760
Iron can be, you can find iron, which is the rock that you're digging up that contains iron,

453
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,040
can be 20% iron.

454
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,520
So you could do the math here.

455
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,080
That means for a pound of iron, you dig up five pounds of rock.

456
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:15,240
Copper, however, and a lot of the other metals are much less common in the earth's crust.

457
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,760
So the average copper ore grade now is well below 1%.

458
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,120
So a pound of copper, you have to dig up 100 pounds of rock, and it's declining.

459
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,880
This is true for every metal.

460
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,000
The percentage of the rock that's the metal you want, typically the single digit percentages

461
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,880
are a fraction of percent.

462
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,280
And if it's the rarer metals, that's so-called rare earths, even more, which aren't rare,

463
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,960
by the way, they're actually very common.

464
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,160
They just, I mean, in the geology of the earth they're common, geography of the earth,

465
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,560
they just aren't, they have rare properties.

466
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,880
They're called rare earths because they're properties, not because of their,

467
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,960
we know where they are, we know how to find them, you have to dig up lots of dirt.

468
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,040
So you have to dig up two kinds of dirt.

469
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,080
You have to dig up what's called overburden, you have to get to the ore body.

470
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,040
So if you're lucky, it's an open pit mine on the surface.

471
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,280
You don't have to get a lot of dirt out of the way.

472
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:07,000
So you have rocks and dirt, you have to get out of the way, dig that up, it's just waste.

473
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,840
Then you dig up the ore and then you're digging up again.

474
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,360
If it's a ton of copper, you're digging up, you know, not a hundred tons, right?

475
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,880
You're digging over over a hundred tons of ore, which you then have to crush

476
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,920
with big energy consuming machines into powder.

477
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,440
Do you have to crush rocks?

478
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,880
Then you have to dissolve the rocks with sulfuric acid.

479
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,840
We're dissolving rocks and the more rock you have to dissolve,

480
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,960
the more acids you have to use, the more acids, the more energy to make the acids,

481
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,440
the more energy to keep everything clean.

482
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,640
It means this is a beyond obvious do loop of very energy-intensive activities.

483
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,600
And then when you get the refined metal, you have to ship it.

484
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,120
This is a refining process like everything else is separate from the mining.

485
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,200
Then you have to go to the chemical industries that convert the refined metals

486
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,320
or minerals into the nature of the specific material you need for the battery,

487
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,440
which is another chemical and energy-intensive process.

488
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,000
That's the most...

489
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
When you put that all together, that's where you get this,

490
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,480
you know, not only does it take 500,000 pounds of rock extracted for your one battery,

491
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,560
but all in, if you mentioned oil terms, you're going to consume between

492
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:19,320
one in 300 barrels of oil equivalent in energy to make a battery that can hold

493
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,560
about one barrel of oil equivalent of energy.

494
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,200
Amazing.

495
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
I looked at two points I just want to share with you,

496
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,240
but I don't want to hear you keep talking because I just keep learning so much.

497
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:35,000
These earth-moving machines, huge, huge, huge machines that move all this earth you mentioned,

498
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,040
I looked up and the average one is 237,000 gallons per year,

499
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,760
12 feet high off the ground.

500
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,640
These are huge.

501
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,640
And that's why I guess, you know, in mining, energy costs are such a big factor,

502
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,560
you know, you have to move this stuff.

503
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,520
And it just boggles my mind that people do not take this into account.

504
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,720
They think it's fairy dust that it comes here and I did too.

505
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,320
I got to admit when I got two of my two Teslas and I traded them,

506
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,400
I thought I was doing something great for the environment.

507
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:10,360
And then now every night that I plug it in, I realized that it didn't come here by magic.

508
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,640
All of the fuel that was needed to do that.

509
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:19,960
The second thing I just wanted to touch on for us is that most of this refinery

510
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,440
is done in China because who the heck wants a refinery in their backyard?

511
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:24,920
Is that right?

512
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,760
Yeah. Well, back to your machines, by the way, I love these big mining trucks.

513
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,120
They're literally the size of a house, these trucks, the size of a house.

514
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,920
They're great.

515
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,080
And the idea that we're going to convert those mining trucks to not using diesel in their future is...

516
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,360
What are they going to do on solar?

517
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,960
You know, these things are huge.

518
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,800
You can make them, you can run them on batteries too, if you make enough batteries.

519
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:51,640
But to say it's impractical to do it is a breathtaking understatement.

520
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,360
We're not going to be running these trucks anything other than big diesel generators

521
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,840
and diesel engines for a very, very long time.

522
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,680
And by that I mean, you know, many, many decades.

523
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:05,400
The machines themselves have a life, a useful life of 30 to 40 years.

524
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,360
Once you spend millions of dollars, tens of millions of a machine,

525
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,800
you're going to run it for a long time.

526
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,680
But, you know, back to your question of where the refineries are.

527
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,360
I mean, so they're elsewhere.

528
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,080
They're not in America or Europe by and large.

529
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,520
There's some, not many, very, very few.

530
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,400
So what we're doing is we're making an interesting trade.

531
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:25,640
Right.

532
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,600
The United States in particular is domestically self-efficient.

533
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,120
In fact, in hydrocarbons, we're a net exporter of hydrocarbons if we count all in.

534
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,080
We were almost, we were briefly a net exporter of oil and oil products.

535
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,600
Right, in 2018, wasn't it 2018 or so we were a net exporter?

536
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:46,840
Well, it was 2019, 2020, into that year, we were still, if you count, you know,

537
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,560
we still import because there's an arbitrage, you know, you import crew,

538
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,680
you export refined products.

539
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:57,320
But we are functionally independent of the need for imports functionally.

540
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,520
I just remember back in the 70s during the energy crisis and going to school there.

541
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,160
And it was always a dream that one day America would be self-sufficient.

542
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,400
And we had OPEC with a gun to our head.

543
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,960
And after the the Arabs really were of 1973, when they placed it in Bargo,

544
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,080
the oil was there, but they didn't ship it to us to the United States.

545
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,360
We were, we didn't have production.

546
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,720
We were way, way behind.

547
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:27,400
And now it seems that we traded off OPEC for China.

548
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,120
We're now reliant on China refining our metals and lithium batteries.

549
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,400
And this whole green energy seems like to be playing into the hands of China.

550
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,480
Is it might be a little crazy on that?

551
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,080
Or is that those are the facts?

552
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,600
No, it's that you're just stating, let's, let's put aside the geopolitical implications.

553
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,360
You could just look at the facts first, right?

554
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,480
I mean, the U.S. is a net export of hydrocarbons.

555
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,640
China is a net importer of hydrocarbons.

556
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,520
China has a market share in refining what the IEA, the International Energy Agency,

557
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:01,720
calls energy minerals, the things like copper and lithium carbonate.

558
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,840
So the refining of energy minerals, that capacity in China, in terms of global market share, is

559
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,800
double OPEC's global market share in oil.

560
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:19,080
So China by itself is the OPEC on steroids of energy minerals for refining.

561
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,760
Hey, if you're a reasonable person, would say, well, can we do something about that?

562
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,800
Can we do something about that?

563
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,320
Couldn't we resharrow those refineries?

564
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:25,880
Of course we can.

565
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,760
You first, you have to want to, you have to put in place the kind of regulatory environment

566
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,720
that makes it possible to build them economically.

567
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,680
That hasn't happened in any of the legislation by any president, by the way, in decades.

568
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,360
So we don't have the appetite politically to do that, and we're not doing it, even if

569
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,880
tomorrow we decided to do it.

570
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:53,480
The velocity of demand for those minerals, the mandating batteries be put in cars instead of gas

571
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:59,640
tanks, vastly exceeds the velocity with which we could reshor the supply of those minerals.

572
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,920
So the mining is elsewhere.

573
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,320
We can't open mines easily in America.

574
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:10,600
The administration last year reversed permits that were millions of dollars in years in

575
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,760
development for copper and nickel mines, three of them in the United States, just reversed

576
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:21,400
the permits after many years of trying to get the permits in place and passing all the tests,

577
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,280
if you like.

578
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,920
They passed in flying colors, they were failed anyway.

579
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:31,160
So the path that we're on is unequivocally one of increasing dependencies on foreign sources

580
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,280
for the premier materials and the refined materials.

581
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:39,160
But we're sort of hiding behind the fig leaf of subsidizing what are called EV factories or

582
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,960
battery factories.

583
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:46,600
These are assembly plants, which are still dependent on importing metals and materials

584
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,760
and minerals refined elsewhere.

585
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:53,960
So it would be no different than the symmetrical equivalent is what you described going back

586
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:59,960
to the dawns of the energy embargoes, oil embargoes, is that we were assembling cars

587
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,920
in America and we, in fact, had very few foreign cars sold in America at that time.

588
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:09,240
But we were very dependent on gasoline and oil imports, the fuel cars.

589
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:14,600
So what we're doing now is replicating the exact situation we were in 50 years ago.

590
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:23,000
We just replaced refined minerals and metals and these things with the lithium

591
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,880
cobalt, I think with 17 or so of minerals that we need are none of the friendliest places in

592
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,520
the world for us.

593
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,840
Well, we're, you know, we used to be one of the primary suppliers of many of these metals and

594
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,240
minerals.

595
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,480
US is geophysically rich in all these metals and minerals.

596
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,000
But like, you know, there's nothing wrong.

597
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,360
Count me in the free trade camp, right?

598
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,360
I'm happy to trade with other countries.

599
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,600
When you get trade concentration is when you get geopolitical risks and problems.

600
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:56,920
And of course, the risk with China is beyond obvious.

601
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:03,000
You don't have to be anti-China or pro-China to observe the fact that we're in economic

602
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,040
conflict with them for sure.

603
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:08,440
I hope it stays just an economic, we're certainly in political conflict with them.

604
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,040
And so we've handed them and they've made this decision 20 years ago.

605
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,640
It was public information.

606
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,440
They published the fact of their goals.

607
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,280
So we knew what they were planning to do.

608
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:24,120
So now we have this sort of odd balance to pick up on what President Biden said and his

609
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,840
Secretary of Energy have said, world's going to use oil for a long time.

610
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,880
Another point to make is China is going to be dependent on oil and gas imports for a long time

611
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,120
too.

612
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,960
They can't, they can't match what we've done in the oil and gas world.

613
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,560
They're not anywhere close to it.

614
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,800
So they, they actually have a bargaining chip now.

615
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,120
I mean, if you think about it in this simple geopolitical terms, they had no bargaining

616
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,760
chips. They were very deeply dependent on vital energy imports to keep their economy running.

617
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:55,240
We could, we could cause them a lot of pain both directly and indirectly in oil and gas

618
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,440
markets, natural gas markets.

619
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,320
Well, you know, they could cause an awful lot of pain to the world as the world increases

620
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,200
its dependency on energy minerals to build windmills, solar arrays and electric batteries.

621
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,160
So it's, it's not an accidental strategy.

622
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,080
It's actually a brilliant strategy, especially when you consider they,

623
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:17,240
they now have price control over those energy minerals, because they utterly dominate the

624
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,080
market far more again, far more than OPEC.

625
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,480
And we, we don't have any effective way to offset that price control,

626
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:30,680
except to do the equivalent of what we did in the gas industry with minerals.

627
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,880
Turns out that's a lot harder.

628
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,720
I mean, the velocity of opening a mine versus the velocity of getting a oil well in place

629
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,680
are profoundly different.

630
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,800
They're just the different.

631
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:45,240
This is like, I mean, to put it very simplistically, it's like the difference in the

632
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,280
velocity of building a mining truck and building a go-kart.

633
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,440
I mean, mines are huge.

634
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,240
They take decades to, to build typically.

635
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,080
The average in the world is 16 years to go from discovery to to happen.

636
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,840
I recently heard you speak about a copper mine.

637
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:05,240
How long does it take from start to finish to start to digging was 16?

638
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,280
Yeah, the average IEA says is 16 years, but it could be,

639
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,480
it could be 10 years in some, in some jurisdictions, if, if you're lucky, and it could be

640
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,600
30 and others, infinite in the United States apparently.

641
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,800
But if you wanted to compare that to the oil and gas world, the, the slowest,

642
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,640
the most difficult projects in terms of velocity are offshore, offshore rakes, offshore oil projects.

643
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,960
And one of the most remarkable accelerations that's occurred, sort of untold stories,

644
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,160
is that that's been cut in half from a decade to five years roughly.

645
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,880
But still five years to do a billion dollar offshore oil platform to go into production

646
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,320
from, you know, discovery to production.

647
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,080
A shale well from, you know, you don't have to discover a shale.

648
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:47,720
We know where it is.

649
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,000
I've always known where it is.

650
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,520
But the decision, let's say decision to production in a shale well depends on where it is,

651
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,160
but six months to a year, it's very, very quick.

652
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,720
So you're looking at velocities in the oil and gas world

653
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,960
that are literally 10 times faster than the velocities in the minerals world.

654
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:13,720
And, and the minerals world's velocities are all attached to foreign jurisdictions,

655
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,920
which are opaque, often corrupt, subject to bribes.

656
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:25,480
It's, to, to labor practices that we, we, we would, when we know about them, find offensive.

657
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,080
Child labor is rampant in the mining minerals world in Africa and South America.

658
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,520
It's not, it's not up to say it's not a nice thing.

659
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,920
It's a breathtaking understatement that, but it's generally ignored.

660
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,560
As you know, I reviewed a book for the Wall Street Journal recently called Cobalt

661
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,600
Red, which the author, professor of human trafficking and slavery in England,

662
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,320
was pretty, pretty gutsy.

663
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:54,440
He, he went down to Congo into East and Congo and went visiting the mine sites,

664
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,360
which you're not supposed to visit to try to document the extent to which the cobalt

665
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,680
mining in particular is done, what's called as euphemism, artisanally,

666
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,200
which means by hand with a shovel and how much of that's with children.

667
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:12,120
And of course, he reports that he thinks that the percentage that it's artisanal

668
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,360
and child labor is vastly higher.

669
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:22,760
The official estimates are something like 20% of the mining in, in Congo for cobalt is artisanal

670
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,440
and maybe half that's with children.

671
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,400
He thinks it's far higher, but even if it isn't far higher, it's pretty,

672
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
it's pretty grotesque when you think about it.

673
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:32,920
Does that matter?

674
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:38,120
Well, yeah, because as he points out correctly, pretty much every lithium battery and every

675
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:41,640
portable device has cobalt because you need it for the energy density.

676
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,000
The majority of the world's electric car still use cobalt.

677
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,000
And of course, those that don't use cobalt in their batteries, you can,

678
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,360
you can switch up the chemistry.

679
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,160
There's lots of different chemical soups you can use.

680
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,160
You use typically more nickel, for example.

681
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,440
So you're shifting your demand for one metal to another,

682
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,000
which still takes you on the same path of foreign minds, foreign refining,

683
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,840
questionable labor practices, all of which in principle can be fixed and made transparent.

684
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,360
In principle, it's just, it's not there right now.

685
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,080
It's not where we are.

686
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,840
So, yeah, Siddharth Rathkarra, you're referring to a cobalt red.

687
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,920
I'm going to have him on the show.

688
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,960
He's just fascinating.

689
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,600
He read his book.

690
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,800
It was just unbelievable what he did exposing.

691
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,080
And most of those minds in Congo were in partnership with the Chinese.

692
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,520
They were there in 0809.

693
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,200
They saw the opportunity right there that the world's going to need cobalt.

694
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,200
And every lithium battery, I think it is, cobalt is part of.

695
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,600
Well, in every high performance device, lithium battery.

696
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:48,840
But the big, you can, you know, one can make lithium batteries with no cobalt at all.

697
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,920
There's lithium iron phosphate batteries.

698
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,440
There's nickel manganese batteries.

699
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,440
There's lots of different chemical formulations.

700
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:00,200
But as you change the chemical mix, you trade off things like temperature tolerance, fire,

701
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,640
safety, range.

702
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,520
The now favored lithium iron phosphate, which the pioneered in China,

703
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:13,400
is a very clever battery chemistry, very safe chemistry, relatively speaking,

704
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,800
and safer than the cobalt class batteries.

705
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,120
But it has lower energy density.

706
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:23,240
So you have to either have a bigger battery to get the range, which so instead of a thousand

707
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,600
pound battery, it's 1200 pounds, which means more metals.

708
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,200
Which means more aluminum, more FIFO, everything would be.

709
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
Yeah, more copper, more aluminum, or.

710
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:30,760
Pick your poison.

711
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,560
Or you have less range, and everybody's trying to sell range.

712
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,640
So in China, you don't have to sell range because there's lots of people without cars.

713
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:43,160
So really small cars with okay range, which is what's going on as a first vehicle

714
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,800
with arguably features and safety standards that most Americans won't buy and tolerate.

715
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,800
It's a big market for them in China.

716
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,320
So that'll be true in India.

717
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,560
So I expect there's going to be lots more of those cars.

718
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,800
In fact, China's export of their electric vehicles, if you track that data,

719
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,520
they have become a powerhouse and not just producing electric vehicles,

720
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,400
but exporting electric cars and vehicles in general.

721
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,160
They're not to us.

722
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,760
We're not buying them yet here.

723
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,400
I think that'll happen, but to emerging markets, of course.

724
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:21,320
Yeah, I think EYD just put a showroom together somewhere in the United States with their electric

725
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,840
bus, which looks unbelievable.

726
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,160
They're going to get a flip to the toehold here.

727
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:35,320
I think probably one of the best engineered batteries for a car in the world is still a Tesla.

728
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,440
Dick Elon Musk's focus in this early before everybody else gave him a huge head start,

729
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,160
terrific team.

730
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,480
The engineering is absolutely brilliant.

731
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,560
It really is the level of the energy density and safety and quality on the battery.

732
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,920
I'm not talking about the car overall.

733
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,680
The car is fine, but it's not a standout in terms of quality.

734
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,560
It's just fine.

735
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,040
But the battery is impressive.

736
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,280
And the rest of the world is catching up.

737
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,120
They'll probably get to pair up a suit with him in due course.

738
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:12,600
I would say BYD's batteries probably pretty much on par with Tesla's engineering, getting there.

739
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,520
Chinese engineering on this stuff is very good.

740
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,800
They've been at it a very long time.

741
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:19,400
I've traveled to China several times.

742
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:25,240
I've been in maybe, I think, 12 or 14 Chinese cities, visited battery factories there and

743
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,320
electric car factories and bus factories.

744
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,200
This was pre-epic lockdowns, of course.

745
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,680
This is the last few years.

746
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,280
It's a little more difficult lately.

747
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,040
A friend of mine just went there and told me he was put into quarantine 10 days anyway,

748
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,640
despite negative tests, passports, visas, vaxes.

749
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,560
He still had to be quarantined.

750
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,960
So I hope it was a nice hotel.

751
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,160
Probably was, knowing him.

752
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,280
Here's the thing that's sort of puzzling to me about,

753
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,200
and I think it's in people's heads about electric cars.

754
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,760
I'll come back to the mythology of this.

755
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,240
There are elsewhere omissions and lots of omissions.

756
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:04,760
It's elsewhere dependencies, elsewhere jobs.

757
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,960
All those things are all true.

758
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:11,800
But there's this sort of naive belief that it's a simpler vehicle.

759
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,080
I mean, look, it's just a battery and electric motor.

760
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,040
What could be simpler?

761
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:16,920
Look at that.

762
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,080
It's got to be inherently cheaper to make eventually.

763
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,840
If that were true, if they were inherently simpler,

764
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,120
that might be true.

765
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,640
It would be inherently cheaper to make.

766
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,840
But it's not true.

767
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,400
The battery is not like the little double-A cell

768
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,320
you stick in a child's toy.

769
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:38,440
This half-ton engine, it's actually an electrochemical engine,

770
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,600
has thousands of parts in it.

771
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,360
If it's a Tesla battery, maybe tens of thousands of parts,

772
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:48,520
but lots of batteries, thousands of parts, tens of thousands of welds,

773
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,440
cooling systems, electronic control systems, structural systems.

774
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:57,000
It's a complicated, multi-thousand-part electrochemical engine.

775
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,520
The motor is simple.

776
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,040
Electric motor has two moving parts.

777
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,280
In an internal combustion engine, we just flop the complexities.

778
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,240
The fuel tank has two moving parts.

779
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,920
It's an electric motor that pumps your fuel, two moving parts.

780
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,720
A little tiny one.

781
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,400
The tank has nothing yet.

782
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,840
It's just fluid.

783
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,320
The engine, on the other hand,

784
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,280
instead of being an electrochemical engine with thousands of parts,

785
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,320
it's a thermochemical engine with thousands of parts.

786
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,960
We've just swapped mechanical, thermo-mechanical complexity

787
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,040
for electrochemical complexities.

788
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,320
They're both complex.

789
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,880
They both wear out at the molecular level.

790
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,360
Wear and tear on an engine with reciprocating parts

791
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,880
is literally at the molecular level.

792
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,440
Batteries wear out, electrochemistry wears out at the molecular level.

793
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,680
They both have performance characteristics that vary with temperature,

794
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,400
all kinds of both have safety issues.

795
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,400
The difference between them is that the complicated fuel tank

796
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,880
in an electric car is made of expensive minerals

797
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,320
as opposed to cheap iron ore and steel.

798
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,240
The mineral costs that go into a battery constitute about 70% or 80%

799
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,920
of the cost to make the battery.

800
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,800
Once you know that we now are making batteries so efficiently,

801
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,680
if I took all the labor out and said the labor was free,

802
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,440
the capital and the overhead for the automated machines is free,

803
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,960
that would reduce the cost of a battery by 20%, 25%.

804
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,440
That's it.

805
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,160
It's not game-changing.

806
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,400
What you're left with is, put differently,

807
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,360
is the future cost of batteries for electric cars,

808
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,520
which dominates the cost of the electric car,

809
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,080
is entirely dependent on the future of the mining industry.

810
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,920
What we're making a bet on when we tell people

811
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,760
they won't be able to buy internal combustion engines

812
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:53,800
is a bet that the mining industry will cooperate

813
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,360
and provide both enough minerals and metals

814
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:59,080
and cheaply enough to keep consumers happy.

815
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:03,240
The mining operations in parts of the world

816
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,320
which are not the friendliest in the United States.

817
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,040
Well, they're not here.

818
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,440
And they're also, I mean, the most important point, of course,

819
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,280
is that the cost of these minerals has been rising.

820
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:18,120
So a lot of the 2022 price spikes and everything

821
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,720
have come off of the highs, including inflation overall.

822
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,800
Inflation is still at a 40-year high.

823
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,640
In fact, it's a 50-year high,

824
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,560
but it's below the peak of last summer.

825
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,440
Mineral prices similarly are still at highs.

826
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,000
They're about, depending on the basket you choose,

827
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,840
but the kind of metals that go into batteries,

828
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,480
electric cars, nickel, copper, aluminum,

829
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,040
they're all about 200% to 300% more expensive

830
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:40,920
than five years ago.

831
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,480
Aluminum is at multi-decade highs still.

832
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,400
The lithium is still, instead of being 1,800% more expensive,

833
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,960
it's only 900% more expensive than it was five years ago.

834
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,360
So all the minerals and metals are going into

835
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,680
making electric vehicles and solar arrays

836
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,040
have become more expensive,

837
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:02,520
which is driving up the cost of those machines.

838
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,080
So the last year and this year and next year,

839
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,320
batteries are getting more expensive,

840
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,960
have got more expensive, wind turbines are got more expensive,

841
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,080
are going to get more expensive.

842
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,080
Same with solar and all of them have the same characteristic.

843
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:20,840
They all depend for their price forecasts

844
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,360
on the availability and price of the input minerals and metals.

845
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,040
So the most important thing that's being missed

846
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,040
in all the ambitious plans to make this energy transition

847
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,480
is acknowledgement that every one of the plans,

848
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,680
there's no exception, all plans in all countries,

849
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,400
all the aspirants to this transition,

850
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,160
a certain belief that the costs of these machines

851
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,200
will get cheaper, not a little bit, by a lot in the future.

852
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,480
All of them are asserting and model all of their forecasts

853
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,640
on every declining costs for electric cars,

854
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,800
their batteries, windmills and solar arrays.

855
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:04,120
That model, those claims are profoundly and completely dependent

856
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,640
on the cost of the metals and minerals.

857
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,400
And about that, I would take the bet.

858
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,760
Those are not going to go down,

859
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:13,160
but I just want to know on what basis they're assuming

860
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,960
these things will get cheaper at the rate that they're claiming.

861
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:21,160
That is, put differently, for the battery to go down by 50% in price,

862
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,160
electric car batteries about $10,000 to make, roughly.

863
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,720
So for it to become,

864
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,880
and that's about what the average price premium is

865
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,200
for electric car over conventional car.

866
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,680
This roughly, setting aside the really expensive high-end cars

867
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,600
which comprise 5% of market.

868
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,000
We're talking about the cars that people drive every day,

869
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,400
the $22,000 Nissan, the $22,000 Toyota.

870
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,400
To make that an electric vehicle,

871
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:50,280
you basically increase its cost by $8,000 or $10,000.

872
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,000
The input costs.

873
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:56,040
To cost parity, the battery has to be free, essentially.

874
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,560
Because internal combustion engines don't cost much.

875
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,920
The government has to give a subsidy.

876
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:01,480
Well, okay.

877
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,240
But what's going on, and we've already seen this,

878
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,920
is when the government gives the subsidies,

879
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,440
the car doesn't get cheaper.

880
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,080
The automaker keeps the price at that,

881
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,000
and they raise the price and extract the benefit for themselves.

882
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,600
But you're right.

883
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,840
In principle, you could subsidize it enough to make it cheaper.

884
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,160
Sure.

885
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,360
I guess the real question is,

886
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:25,240
what percentage of cars are governments willing to subsidize?

887
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,440
100% of them, apparently,

888
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,880
because if we ban internal combustion engines entirely,

889
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,720
unless the electric car gets cheaper,

890
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,400
then we're going to have to subsidize every car everybody buys.

891
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,720
But Mark, do we have enough minerals in the world

892
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,200
to make these cars?

893
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:51,560
Or do we have enough copper to replace 1.4 billion light vehicles throughout the world?

894
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,240
Yes, Howard.

895
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,440
The question has to be phrased carefully,

896
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,880
because for this reason, and this is not to criticize you, Charles,

897
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,120
is because the answer to the question,

898
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,520
are there enough minerals in the world, is unequivocally yes.

899
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,080
Because I've been accused recently of something that was the deepest cut

900
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,480
that's ever been leveled against me in my career.

901
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,320
I was called a Malthusian for saying

902
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,320
that we don't have enough minerals in the world,

903
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,040
as if I'm the anti-Malthusian.

904
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:23,480
Anyway, there are enough metals and minerals in the Earth's crust.

905
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,800
This is not, in fact, that some researchers recently at MIT put out a study

906
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,920
to prove the obvious.

907
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,240
There are enough minerals in the world to finance all cars being electric.

908
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,120
Yes, of course there are.

909
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:34,840
That's not the point.

910
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,800
The point really implicit in this is, are we now mining enough,

911
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:45,320
and are the world's mines investing in enough expansion

912
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,360
to provide that quantity of copper and aluminum and nickel?

913
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:50,200
And for that, we know the answer.

914
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,680
And again, courtesy of the International Energy Agency,

915
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:57,880
we want to have to increase the mining of things like copper by nearly 300%,

916
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:04,200
things like lithium by something about 500%, for graphite by about 800% or 1,000%.

917
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:11,720
The increase in mining required to meet this are numbers that have never been seen,

918
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,960
I mean, literally in modern history.

919
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:20,040
But more importantly, even if you naively thought you could expand mines that fast enough,

920
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,000
you would want to ask the obvious question.

921
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,200
Are the world's mining industries announcing plans and investments in the coming decade

922
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,160
that are even close to what's required?

923
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,000
And there are businesses that follow this stuff, Reistad does.

924
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,440
There are mining analysts that follow this stuff.

925
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,920
Wood McKenzie has put out very good data on this.

926
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:47,880
Roughly speaking, the world's mining industry is investing about 10% of what's required

927
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,880
to meet 2330 goals, 10% of what's required.

928
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:57,320
Or put differently, we're going to miss the availability of the metals to make enough

929
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,120
electric vehicles by 2030 by a factor of 10.

930
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,480
Amazing.

931
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,600
Absolutely amazing.

932
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:08,040
And by the way, just to close with this, even if we got rid of all of the 1.4

933
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,320
billion light vehicles on the road today that suck up gas,

934
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,200
what are we saving in the world's fuel consumption?

935
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,400
Because like you said, the fuel is going to have to go somewhere.

936
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,760
We're going to need fuel in order to make all these other things.

937
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,360
So what would be the net savings?

938
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,720
If you could wave the wand, which we sort of did with lockdowns.

939
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,960
We stopped people from driving as much.

940
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:35,240
If you could wave the wand, you could eliminate about a quarter of the world's oil use.

941
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:40,280
If you did overnight, no more driving of internal combustion engine vehicles,

942
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,720
like duty vehicles, small trucks.

943
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,160
From a viewpoint of overall hydrocarbon use, oil, gas, and coal combined,

944
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,520
your total reduction is about 7% of the world's hydrocarbon use.

945
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,240
But remember, the wand waving is not happening.

946
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,080
We're looking at 20 years.

947
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:01,240
20 years from now, the increased consumption of oil for the mining machinery,

948
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:06,040
for aviation, for heavy trucks and delivery, shipping, all the other factors

949
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:11,880
would mean that even if you could get to 100% electric vehicle penetration 20 years from now,

950
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:19,080
you would eliminate, by my estimation, about 12 to 15% of the world's oil use at that time.

951
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,120
So that's something.

952
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,280
It's a lot of oil.

953
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:26,840
But the more important question that you'd have to ask if your strategist or an analyst is,

954
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,720
who's producing the other 80% to 90%?

955
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:30,520
Where's it coming from?

956
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,240
Who's investing in that?

957
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,760
Well, you know, OPEC is.

958
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,760
Russia will continue to do that.

959
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,640
China is investing in oil and gas expansion in their country and offshore on their shores.

960
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,080
I saw the last eight quarters.

961
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:50,120
On average, the U.S. oil industry has not been spending in due to the administration

962
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:54,280
and political risk into capital expenditures and to drilling.

963
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,160
So that's eight quarters.

964
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,000
So our supply is greatly lagged.

965
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,160
And suppose you put a big frame around this.

966
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,400
We're talking about 100 million barrels a day is what we're sucking up, right?

967
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,840
So even if the world consumes 100 million barrels a day,

968
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:11,240
so even 30 years, let's say 20 years out, so with 10% reduction,

969
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,680
we're still going to be using 90 million barrels or so a day at the best.

970
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,240
But who knows?

971
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:18,200
Maybe we'll 80%, 80 million.

972
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,480
It's not zero.

973
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,560
Anyone who thinks it's zero is.

974
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,440
Well, that's the problem.

975
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:28,520
Even if you imagine the scenario is wildly optimistic as you get to all,

976
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:34,280
in fact, electric cars are at price parity or subsidized to be a price parity.

977
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,000
And you get you get rid of 20 million barrels per day of oil.

978
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:41,080
You still have to produce at least 80 if nothing else grows.

979
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,160
And since other things will grow, you're still going to have to produce closer to 90

980
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,520
million barrels per day.

981
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,960
So the question that's important because it's only 20 years away that we're going to

982
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,160
force this quote transition, it's back to where we started.

983
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,640
This is not a transition, right?

984
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,120
This is not a transition away from oil use.

985
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,480
It's a reduction in oil use, even if it were to happen.

986
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:05,560
But it's not a transition away from the need for hydrocarbons.

987
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:09,480
And to make it apolitical, to your point under this administration's

988
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,800
hostility to oil and gas, which has been moderated by the president's

989
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:20,840
intemperate off-script remarks, okay, I'll give him credit for doing it because

990
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:24,040
he had to have been realizing as soon as he started saying it what he was saying.

991
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:29,320
He's not, whatever other people think, he's pretty aware of what he's saying.

992
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:34,200
He may have loose lips, but a lot of presidents have had loose lips when they're talking.

993
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:40,840
Here's the thing is that it's not just under this presidency or the previous presidency

994
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,840
where it was much more enthusiasm, oil and gas.

995
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:46,680
But if we look at the global oil and gas industry, so we get out of the United States

996
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:53,000
and we look at the behaviors of capital markets broadly where the investments come from both

997
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:59,400
both the private markets, private banks, and public banks, if you like, the international

998
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:04,440
banking system, especially the European banking system, it's been hostile to oil and gas investment

999
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:11,240
for about 15 years. And so if we charted the total capital expenditures of the oil and gas

1000
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:20,200
industry globally in new production, it started going down like off a cliff 15 years ago.

1001
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:24,360
And then when COVID hit and then this president was elected, the combination

1002
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:32,440
accelerated down. So we're now at epic lows that began, predates US lack of enthusiasm,

1003
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:38,280
let's call it. Let's give the administration credit for giving a permit to Conoco Phillips

1004
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:45,880
for dealing in Alaska, even though the jury is out as whether or not they've also put it into place,

1005
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:51,640
we'll call it the expedite rules or at least arbitration rules so that they can get it built

1006
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:56,360
as quickly as they built the original oil production in Alaska. So they don't, it's just

1007
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:00,360
it'll never get built under litigation. So that should bring in 180,000 barrels

1008
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:06,520
when that's up and running. But it's a huge fine, right? I mean, a really productive

1009
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:13,000
shale well, and that's like putting a couple hundred really productive shale wells in place

1010
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:19,560
all at once. I mean, it's a big deal when they get it going. So we have this general

1011
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:24,600
antipathy in the investment world, private and public, and a lot of social and public pressure,

1012
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:30,120
a lot of overt pressure, not to invest net new money in oil and gas globally. And it's had the

1013
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:35,560
effect that was intended. The investment's gone down. It's had the effect. And the fact that

1014
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:39,560
sort of everybody knows if you're an analyst, but it's, you don't have to understand the

1015
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:46,600
only gas industry to know this important fact. You have to, just like food, you have to plant

1016
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:50,840
crops every year. In the oil and gas business, when you consume energy from oil from a well

1017
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:57,080
or gas, the well eventually is exhausted. It's capacity. So you have to plant new,

1018
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,600
the exploration each year and development is the equivalent of planting new food each year.

1019
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:07,560
And we know the decline rate, the global decline rate for all the world's oil wells. If we stopped

1020
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:12,440
investing in new ones tomorrow with the zero, every year we'd have about six or seven million

1021
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:18,200
barrels per day less oil available to the world. So we'll put differently. We have to

1022
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:27,880
find and put into production oil output pretty close to what Texas does every year globally.

1023
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,680
Without making a prediction, because I know that's not what you're doing. I hate predictions,

1024
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:39,400
my episodically get into the game of predicting. I get trapped into and

1025
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:44,040
have to make predictions the case that we all do. This is simple economics 101.

1026
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:49,880
Supply is shrinking and being crimped and not being replaced even at the rate of seven million

1027
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:54,600
barrels a year. We're consuming, even if we stay at 100 million, but we know that's not the case.

1028
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:59,800
China was reopening, India, other development countries want the same benefits we all have

1029
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:05,880
is electricity 24-7 or the availability of that. No brownouts on that. Even if that stays the same,

1030
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:11,560
we're in a situation the way I see it, where five years or so from now, how could oil prices not be

1031
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:18,040
higher? Yeah, I think if you know, the thing about oil prices is if you're really good at

1032
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:22,520
predicting them, especially in the mid-short-term, you're a very wealthy person, as we all know.

1033
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:28,440
It's true for all commodities. So commodities are impacted by lots of variables, but with

1034
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:35,880
oil it's easy. Oil is still utterly deeply tied to our economy, first of all, since to state an

1035
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:42,520
obvious fact, 98% of all the world's movement of goods and people is moved by burning oil,

1036
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:51,960
98%. And if you get all the EVs to happen in the next 20 years, maybe you get it down to 90%.

1037
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:59,320
So the world moves people and goods, things we need and things we want by burning oil.

1038
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:07,400
So if you have a recession, people move less and buy less stuff. So you're reduced to, in

1039
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:11,800
simplistic terms, moving only the essentials, food and things you have to have and have to

1040
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:16,680
replace. You just put everything off. So a really deep recession can really, really put off the

1041
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:21,640
day of reckoning. And I think we're on track for a recession. I'm not a great predictor of

1042
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:27,640
things, but given inflation and interest rates and market psychology and the banking challenges,

1043
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:32,040
it sort of feels like we're already in a mild recession, at least. The world doesn't like

1044
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:37,720
recessions. The world always comes out of recessions. Even the Great Depression, we came out of it

1045
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:45,800
eventually. So the bet you're making to your point is whenever the recession is however long we delay

1046
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:53,160
the oil-consuming impact of growth again, because all growth, including the enthusiastic world,

1047
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:58,040
will result in more oil demand, not less. For the near future, let's forget whether we're

1048
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:02,840
going to have 20 or 30 years. So for the near five years or so. Yeah, five, 10 year future.

1049
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:07,080
So this is what you would look at. You'd look at the decline curve and the investment numbers.

1050
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:12,760
And those are two public numbers. The decline curve we know, the investment's down. So we know

1051
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:20,680
for a fact that a day in the not distant future could be 18 months, could be as soon as 18 months.

1052
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,560
If we dodge a really bad recession, it could happen. If it's a geopolitical event,

1053
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:30,600
it could be even sooner. So who knows? Can I give you a scenario? Here's an

1054
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:39,320
optimist scenario, the pessimistic outcome. Peace breaks out in Ukraine and Putin leaves

1055
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:45,480
office, doesn't have a heart attack, he retires, he's deposed, whatever. So that Russia gets out of

1056
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:52,200
the penalty box and the world wants to buy its oil and gas again. Here's a factor that's not being

1057
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:57,800
threaded into the discussion about future oil prices. Russia is one of the world's biggest

1058
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:03,080
oil exporters. They export 7 million barrels per day. They export much more than we do. They are

1059
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:09,160
like OPEC, the big dogs in oil export. But their oil is being sold at about a 40% discount to market.

1060
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:14,120
Because they're in the penalty box. We sanctioned them so everybody else is buying a discount.

1061
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:19,560
If you're, you don't have to again be an oil trader or an economist to know, if for the first time in

1062
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:25,240
history, the biggest, one of the biggest exporters of a commodity in the world market

1063
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:30,440
has having to sell its stuff for a 40% off of prevailing price, that has dragged the world

1064
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:36,280
price down. If you add to that a mild recession, which is where we're sitting, if you get growth,

1065
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:39,720
so growth will come back if peace breaks out in part because people be enthusiastic,

1066
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:46,440
they have the spirits, all which would be great. Let's pray Xi negotiates a piece, pray that Putin

1067
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:51,960
is exits the world stage in some fashion that we're all comfortable with, whatever that is.

1068
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:57,960
And oil demand goes up and they start trading oil in the market again. Wow.

1069
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,400
But the real price.

1070
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:05,080
It just do the math here. I mean, take 7 million barrels per day, which gets you to sort of a

1071
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:10,760
what's that about 3 billion barrels of oil a year going at a discount of 30 to $4 a barrel.

1072
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:18,360
So there's a $100 billion a year discount in oil going on now because of the current price, right?

1073
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:23,640
That's reflected on the current price. I mean, you could argue it's a good thing that there's

1074
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:30,360
less money flowing to potentates who sell oil, including Putin. We're doing fine and miss record

1075
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:33,960
profits for Exxon and the shale guys are making a lot of money at these prices.

1076
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:40,040
But the bigger economic and political question and the one out of scare politicians witless

1077
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,240
is growth comes back and peace breaks out.

1078
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:49,240
What we don't want, and this is what I think Chairman Powell knows, by the way,

1079
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:56,760
I think he's a very smart guy, when he answered a question that he was put to him last week and

1080
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:00,840
Senate hearings about inflation and the tool he has, which is interest rates.

1081
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:05,000
We're talking about what the other things are that might push inflation. Well,

1082
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:11,000
the Federal Reserve has published pretty good academic papers on the other things like systemic

1083
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,360
increase in commodity prices, not an episodic increase. If you push oil back to $100 a barrel,

1084
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:20,760
leave it there for, I don't know, four or five years instead of four or five months.

1085
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:27,800
I mean, this is inflationary. If it's high enough, it creates recessions by itself.

1086
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:32,360
This is when we had our high oil prices, it acts like a tax on the American people.

1087
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:33,800
It is a tax revenue.

1088
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:37,320
Driving your car, you have to now figure out if I'm traveling 50 miles a day to work,

1089
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:41,560
it's going to cost you X percent more. And I remember back last year in February time,

1090
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:47,480
there were calculations that I don't remember ever thinking about and hearing about that I heard

1091
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:52,520
in the 70s of, well, I only could fill up today and here's what it cost. All of a sudden energy

1092
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:56,520
became a big factor and I'm in New York and I'm seeing what my gas bills are,

1093
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:02,680
my natural gas bill each month and my electric bill, they've gone through the roof. And this is at

1094
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:10,440
a discounted price of crude oil. Amazing. So let's use the language that everybody now understands

1095
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:15,000
if they read papers, systemic risk, right? That when you have policies that create

1096
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:21,560
quote systemic risk, so what do we do with the policy of zero percent money? We create an

1097
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:26,280
systemic risk inflation. When you inflate the cost of money, you have a systemic risk and you end

1098
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:34,600
up with bank failures. So we understand the bludgeoning of markets with ham-handed tools that

1099
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:42,360
have systemic impacts create systemic risks. So let me just use that language. When you create

1100
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:48,360
an environment in which the world is underinvesting in its primary source of moving goods and

1101
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:56,840
people, oil, you've created a systemic risk and that systemic risk is calculable. We know

1102
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:03,240
we have lots of data, just like in the financial markets, what happens if you create an environment

1103
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:09,160
at which the markets demand for oil exceeds its supply systemically, not because there's a brief

1104
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:14,360
war in the Middle East. This is a long-term trend and that's what I've been going over my

1105
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:20,200
numbers and looking at this for the past year and I'm saying myself, how could oil not be higher

1106
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:26,360
five years from now? I'm glad you just laid out the facts. Mark, we've got to have you on again.

1107
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:31,000
I can speak to you for hours and hours and hours, folks. Mark Mills, the name of his latest book,

1108
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
really definitely worth reading, even though it's, let me just say the name of it, the Cloud

1109
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,520
Revolution, how the convergence of new technologies will unleash the next economic boom in our roaring

1110
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:46,280
2020s is a fantastic, I think about six or 70 pages there about energy in that book.

1111
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:53,080
Yeah, really great stuff. Well worth reading and I think it's really enlightening because you

1112
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:58,600
go into research and everyone talks about but no one thinks about. I appreciate that. I mean,

1113
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:04,840
I guess the reason I'm frustrated at us creating systemic risk of high cost energy

1114
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,760
is that we're sitting on the cusp as I try to outline in my book, as you know,

1115
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:14,520
of one of the greatest economic expansion opportunities in the century and growth brings

1116
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:19,160
energy demand. If you make energy expensive, you constrain the growth. It's not that it

1117
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:24,840
will never happen, is that you push it off in time and of course we all know time value amounting

1118
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:28,360
money matters. I mean, if somebody tells you, I'm going to give you a raise in 10 years,

1119
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:33,560
you're not as happy as getting a smaller raise tomorrow. Amazing. For obvious reasons.

1120
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:38,120
All right, Mark, I want to thank you once again, man. Best of luck to you and keep doing the great

1121
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:44,200
work that you do. I follow you when you're speaking on YouTube. You write tons of papers

1122
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:47,960
and really amazing stuff. Keep going for the next 20 years.

1123
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:56,280
Thank you. Thanks. Good to be on and as you know, my podcast is The Last Optimist. I'm still

1124
01:08:56,280 --> 01:09:00,120
