01:21.020 --> 01:26.820
I don't know if this is going to challenge the ethics, but I hope that it might lead to something of a debate towards the end.

01:26.820 --> 01:34.700
OK. First thing to say is, we will never know how life started on Earth.

01:34.700 --> 01:41.660
Even if we invented a time machine and we were able to go back four billion years to the origin of life,

01:41.660 --> 01:47.060
we could not agree among ourselves as scientists in this field, where should we go?

01:47.060 --> 01:51.260
Should we go into the atmosphere? Should we find a beach?

01:51.260 --> 01:56.340
These are stromatolites that you can see. It's actually living rocks, you may say.

01:56.340 --> 01:59.620
Should we go down into the depths of the ocean?

01:59.620 --> 02:05.300
Scientists who work in the field cannot agree with each other about things as simple, you may say, as that.

02:05.300 --> 02:13.740
And if we actually did succeed in agreeing on where to go and we go there and we find some green slime on a rock,

02:13.820 --> 02:22.340
do we know if this is a step en route to the origin of life, or is this some side alley going nowhere in particular?

02:22.340 --> 02:24.740
Again, we have no way of knowing.

02:24.740 --> 02:29.100
So even if we had a time machine, we still wouldn't be able to answer the question.

02:29.100 --> 02:33.660
So you may think it's completely hopeless. Why am I even standing here?

02:33.660 --> 02:37.180
Well, we can. We can hope to understand it.

02:37.180 --> 02:39.620
That's really what we're trying to do.

02:39.620 --> 02:45.860
I don't think there's any likelihood that over the next, say, five to ten years, as some people claim,

02:45.860 --> 02:51.740
that we will succeed in producing life in the lab and we'll have cells growing out of some test tube or something.

02:51.740 --> 02:54.740
I think we are miles and miles away from doing that.

02:54.740 --> 03:00.900
But we can try to understand the kinds of environments, the kind of chemistry going on and all the steps.

03:00.900 --> 03:07.860
We can work out an intellectual framework that will explain how a wet rocky planet with no life on it whatsoever

03:07.860 --> 03:12.420
can give rise to the kind of glorious planet that we live on.

03:12.420 --> 03:16.540
How can we even think about that transition?

03:16.540 --> 03:18.060
I think we can.

03:18.060 --> 03:23.460
What I'd like to try and get across to you this evening is that we're beginning to have some ideas.

03:23.460 --> 03:26.380
At least some people agree with them. Some people don't.

03:26.380 --> 03:31.300
But I want to try and persuade you that it's not just hand waving.

03:31.300 --> 03:34.700
So how do we begin to think about it?

03:34.700 --> 03:40.460
I would say for the last 50, 60 years or so, the guide to the origin of life has really been chemistry.

03:40.460 --> 03:45.060
What chemistry actually works and which chemistry doesn't work so well.

03:45.060 --> 03:51.940
Over the last perhaps 15, 20 years, biology has become involved for the first time.

03:51.940 --> 03:56.980
Until then, surprisingly, biologists had almost nothing to say on the origin of life.

03:56.980 --> 04:01.620
It was dismissed as armchair speculation of the worst kind, not science at all.

04:01.620 --> 04:05.900
Whereas the chemists were thinking, OK, here's an interesting challenge in synthetic chemistry.

04:05.900 --> 04:10.020
Can we make the nucleotides that make up DNA or RNA? Can we make the sugars?

04:10.020 --> 04:13.380
Can we make the lipids to make membranes and so on?

04:13.380 --> 04:17.940
It was a valid question in synthetic chemistry and they've made all of these things.

04:17.940 --> 04:23.420
Then you have a little problem about, OK, you put them all together in a pot and then what happens?

04:23.420 --> 04:26.820
It doesn't just kind of congeal into cells and start crawling out.

04:26.820 --> 04:29.900
So there's something missing still.

04:29.940 --> 04:35.420
Biology, life itself, is an interesting guide and what I'm going to try and suggest to you is that

04:35.420 --> 04:39.500
it's in fact an excellent guide in three different areas.

04:39.500 --> 04:45.780
Energy, metabolism, which is one of those words that tend to put a lot of people off,

04:45.780 --> 04:48.300
but I'll try and explain this as likely as I can.

04:48.300 --> 04:49.900
And then genetic information, genes.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.380
Where does information in biology come from?

04:52.380 --> 04:57.220
Which I think a lot of people find more interesting than metabolism.

04:57.220 --> 05:00.380
On the other hand, it can become quite obscure quite quickly.

05:00.380 --> 05:03.940
When you see the two together, it makes much more sense.

05:03.940 --> 05:07.780
So before I get going, I'm going to orientate you to those three themes.

05:07.780 --> 05:11.260
This is, you could think of this as a bacterial cell.

05:11.260 --> 05:15.180
You could think of this as the mitochondria inside your own cells.

05:15.180 --> 05:17.700
The mitochondria are the power packs inside your cells.

05:17.700 --> 05:21.300
And this is what's happening inside you right now.

05:21.300 --> 05:24.020
Keep this as simple as I can. We're burning glucose.

05:24.020 --> 05:26.540
We're breaking it down to an intermediate.

05:26.540 --> 05:29.540
You don't even don't need to know the name of it, Acetyl CoA.

05:29.540 --> 05:32.100
And we go through this thing called the Krebs cycle.

05:32.100 --> 05:35.980
And the Krebs cycle is basically pulling out CO2 and hydrogen.

05:35.980 --> 05:38.100
That's all I really want you to get from this.

05:38.100 --> 05:41.980
CO2 is a way of breathing it out into the atmosphere,

05:41.980 --> 05:44.500
contributing our own little bit to global warming.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.820
And the hydrogen, while we're splitting the hydrogen,

05:47.820 --> 05:49.620
the hydrogen atoms, two hydrogen atoms,

05:49.620 --> 05:52.420
we're splitting them into their fundamental parts,

05:52.420 --> 05:54.260
the electrons and the protons.

05:54.340 --> 05:58.940
We have a current of electrons going to oxygen.

05:58.940 --> 06:01.020
That current of electrons,

06:01.020 --> 06:04.900
literally pretty much an electric wire inside this membrane,

06:04.900 --> 06:06.260
inside this insulated membrane,

06:06.260 --> 06:10.460
is powering the extrusion of protons across the membrane.

06:10.460 --> 06:13.740
So now we have a lot of protons on this side of the membrane,

06:13.740 --> 06:16.140
very few protons on the inside.

06:16.140 --> 06:17.900
About three orders of magnitude difference,

06:17.900 --> 06:20.780
three pH units difference.

06:20.780 --> 06:23.740
Now that may not seem like very much.

06:23.740 --> 06:29.220
It's about an electrical charge of about 150 to 200 millivolts.

06:29.220 --> 06:32.380
But if you were to shrink yourself down to the size of a molecule

06:32.380 --> 06:35.340
and stand right next to this membrane there,

06:35.340 --> 06:38.380
you would experience an electrical field strength

06:38.380 --> 06:41.940
of about 30 million volts per metre.

06:41.940 --> 06:44.260
That's equivalent to a bolt of lightning.

06:44.260 --> 06:47.780
So this entire surface area of membrane

06:47.780 --> 06:50.260
has got an electrical charge equivalent to a bolt of lightning

06:50.260 --> 06:51.260
going across it.

06:51.260 --> 06:54.060
It's just such a small distance, five nanometres,

06:54.060 --> 06:57.300
that the actual charge is quite small.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.980
But it's quite a field strength.

06:59.980 --> 07:02.060
That is powering everything.

07:02.060 --> 07:05.180
I'm showing here a protein called the ATP synthase.

07:05.180 --> 07:06.580
I'll come back to that later on.

07:06.580 --> 07:09.260
ATP is often called the universal energy currency.

07:09.260 --> 07:11.340
In other words, it's powering work.

07:11.340 --> 07:15.020
But that work doesn't have to be making this ATP,

07:15.020 --> 07:18.060
this energy currency, any kind of work.

07:18.060 --> 07:19.820
It can power the bacterial flagella,

07:19.820 --> 07:22.620
which will kind of row a bacterium around the place.

07:22.620 --> 07:25.140
It can power CO2 fixation,

07:25.140 --> 07:27.340
which is what I'll say more about.

07:27.340 --> 07:31.020
OK, so that's how energy works in biology.

07:31.020 --> 07:32.980
That's basically it for all cells.

07:32.980 --> 07:33.980
It's kind of...

07:33.980 --> 07:36.300
There are plenty of variations on that thing,

07:36.300 --> 07:37.780
but this is fundamental.

07:37.780 --> 07:39.860
All life works that way.

07:39.860 --> 07:40.940
It's amazing.

07:40.940 --> 07:42.140
Your own cells work that way,

07:42.140 --> 07:43.260
bacteria work that way,

07:43.260 --> 07:46.380
stuff that you find high up in the atmosphere

07:46.380 --> 07:47.820
on the outside of the space station

07:47.820 --> 07:50.020
or deep down in the bowels of the earth,

07:50.020 --> 07:51.460
in the deep hot biosphere.

07:51.460 --> 07:53.060
It's all working that way.

07:53.060 --> 07:54.220
It's amazing.

07:54.220 --> 07:58.220
It's as universally conserved as the genetic code itself.

07:58.220 --> 08:01.260
OK, this looks exactly the same.

08:01.260 --> 08:03.940
It's not. It's the opposite.

08:03.940 --> 08:05.500
What I'm showing here is this Krebs cycle

08:05.500 --> 08:07.420
going in the opposite direction.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.940
I've still got hydrogen and CO2.

08:09.940 --> 08:10.860
Think what happens though.

08:10.860 --> 08:13.140
Normally when the Krebs cycle is spinning,

08:13.140 --> 08:15.060
it's pulling out hydrogen and CO2

08:15.060 --> 08:17.140
and it's burning the hydrogen in oxygen.

08:17.140 --> 08:18.300
The reverse Krebs cycle,

08:18.300 --> 08:20.380
and quite a lot of bacteria work this way,

08:20.380 --> 08:22.940
is sucking in hydrogen and CO2

08:22.940 --> 08:25.740
and using the energy of this charged membrane

08:25.740 --> 08:28.660
to make them react together to form organic molecules.

08:28.660 --> 08:29.940
The Krebs cycle intermediates.

08:29.940 --> 08:31.900
They're carboxylic acids.

08:31.900 --> 08:35.340
And from then, we make amino acids and sugars

08:35.340 --> 08:38.060
and nucleotide the building blocks of DNA and RNA

08:38.060 --> 08:40.460
and lipids for the membranes themselves and so on.

08:40.460 --> 08:43.260
So it's not about energy only.

08:43.260 --> 08:45.100
It's also about biosynthesis.

08:45.100 --> 08:48.020
It's about making the building blocks of life.

08:48.020 --> 08:51.060
And this is again really deeply conserved in biology.

08:51.060 --> 08:52.860
Some of the molecules in that Krebs cycle,

08:52.860 --> 08:54.940
not necessarily always as a complete cycle,

08:54.940 --> 08:57.620
sometimes more as a linear pathway,

08:57.620 --> 09:00.780
but there are five molecules in there

09:00.780 --> 09:03.860
which are universally conserved across all of life.

09:03.860 --> 09:07.060
They are the universal precursors for all of metabolism.

09:07.060 --> 09:11.380
This is the starting point for making everything that cells do.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.140
And it's all coming from here.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.300
And it's powered by the same system.

09:15.300 --> 09:16.740
It's just operating in reverse.

09:16.740 --> 09:20.900
So it's kind of strange that both metabolism and energy

09:20.900 --> 09:22.380
are powered by the same system.

09:22.380 --> 09:25.260
There's a tension between which way is it going to go.

09:25.260 --> 09:28.340
And in our own bodies, sometimes it's going both ways.

09:28.340 --> 09:31.940
And cancer very often is working with the Krebs cycle

09:31.940 --> 09:34.660
going in the opposite direction, in this reverse direction,

09:34.660 --> 09:36.740
making the building blocks to make new cells

09:36.740 --> 09:40.260
to power the growth of cancer cells.

09:40.260 --> 09:44.060
So that's in a nutshell how metabolism is working.

09:45.420 --> 09:46.660
And genetic information,

09:46.660 --> 09:49.140
I'm going to come back to this in a little more detail later on,

09:49.140 --> 09:51.100
but just what I want you to take now

09:51.100 --> 09:54.060
is that there are patterns in the genetic code

09:54.060 --> 09:56.460
and these have been known about for 60 years

09:56.460 --> 09:59.140
since the early 1960s,

10:00.420 --> 10:03.940
which suggests that there are direct interactions

10:03.940 --> 10:06.820
between the codons,

10:06.820 --> 10:10.620
which is to say that the units within DNA or RNA

10:10.620 --> 10:13.140
that codes for an amino acid in the protein

10:13.140 --> 10:15.260
and the amino acid itself.

10:15.260 --> 10:17.700
In other words, there's a kind of stickiness, you may say.

10:17.700 --> 10:21.060
There are interactions between that particular letter

10:21.060 --> 10:23.660
and that particular amino acid.

10:23.660 --> 10:26.300
And what that suggests is that the genetic code

10:26.300 --> 10:29.100
is not just some random arbitrary assortment,

10:29.100 --> 10:31.740
but that if you had a random string of RNA,

10:31.740 --> 10:33.940
a random string of letters,

10:34.020 --> 10:37.180
then you would have a non-random string of amino acids

10:37.180 --> 10:40.020
that in one way or another, and it may be more like this,

10:40.020 --> 10:43.180
we don't need to specify exactly how that works.

10:43.180 --> 10:45.740
The patterns are there anyway.

10:45.740 --> 10:48.380
What it suggests is that there are direct interactions

10:48.380 --> 10:51.300
between the amino acids and the bases in the genetic code

10:51.300 --> 10:52.820
that code for them.

10:52.820 --> 10:56.620
And so a random RNA sequence codes and non-random peptide,

10:56.620 --> 11:01.220
if that peptide has function in whatever environment it may be,

11:01.220 --> 11:04.180
then natural selection, as we know it, can start.

11:04.180 --> 11:06.900
And there's no mystery about the origin

11:06.900 --> 11:09.620
of information in biology.

11:11.020 --> 11:14.100
So one thing to say about that immediately.

11:14.100 --> 11:17.340
What I'm suggesting here is that we have electricity

11:17.340 --> 11:20.260
driving metabolism, which is giving rise to genes,

11:20.260 --> 11:22.500
and that means it's all going to happen in one place,

11:22.500 --> 11:24.340
and that's already a little bit unnerving

11:24.340 --> 11:26.260
if you're thinking about the origin of life.

11:26.260 --> 11:29.140
Most theories on the origin of life until now have said,

11:29.140 --> 11:31.660
OK, well, this chemistry happens best over here,

11:31.660 --> 11:34.260
and that chemistry works over there, and this works down here,

11:34.260 --> 11:36.500
and we can bring them all together somehow,

11:36.500 --> 11:39.340
and then they will, as I say, congeal into cells

11:39.340 --> 11:40.900
and crawl out of the test tube.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.860
They don't do that.

11:42.860 --> 11:43.740
So what do they do?

11:43.740 --> 11:49.860
Well, in some kind of a place where we've got a continuous reactivity,

11:49.860 --> 11:52.780
continuous gases being brought together,

11:52.780 --> 11:54.420
let's say hydrogen and CO2,

11:54.420 --> 11:56.740
to react together to form these molecules,

11:56.740 --> 12:00.420
forming genes in the same place.

12:00.420 --> 12:04.140
It's a scary hypothesis, but at least it's testable,

12:04.140 --> 12:05.900
and you could say it's very easily testable

12:05.900 --> 12:09.340
because you can do it if you can get the right conditions.

12:09.340 --> 12:10.340
You can do it on a lab bench.

12:10.340 --> 12:11.740
If it's all happening in the same place,

12:11.740 --> 12:15.060
then you can just go straight ahead and test it.

12:15.060 --> 12:17.500
So what kind of place could it possibly be?

12:17.500 --> 12:20.580
Well, the place I favour, it doesn't have to be here,

12:20.580 --> 12:24.660
but this is something that we can get our head around.

12:24.740 --> 12:27.940
I want to know, as alkaline hydrothermal vents.

12:27.940 --> 12:29.620
They were discovered by Deb Kelly,

12:29.620 --> 12:33.780
who was captain of the Alvin submersible back in the year 2000.

12:33.780 --> 12:36.820
Before that, there had been other deep-sea hydrothermal vents

12:36.820 --> 12:39.220
known back into the 1970s,

12:39.220 --> 12:41.660
but these are quite different.

12:41.660 --> 12:46.060
They're not smoking in the way that you'll mostly be familiar,

12:46.060 --> 12:47.820
I'm sure, with the idea of black smokers

12:47.820 --> 12:50.060
with chimney and smoke coming out of the top,

12:50.060 --> 12:51.420
billowing out of the top.

12:51.420 --> 12:53.220
They're not like that. They almost look dead.

12:53.220 --> 12:54.220
They're not dead.

12:54.220 --> 12:57.860
These are living vent systems with fluids going through them.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.620
Deb Kelly here has got a lump of a black smoker

13:00.620 --> 13:02.900
with this chimney structure,

13:02.900 --> 13:04.980
and this is a bit of lost city,

13:04.980 --> 13:08.020
and you might be able to see it looks a bit like a mineralised sponge.

13:08.020 --> 13:12.620
It's kind of a labyrinth of interconnected pores.

13:12.620 --> 13:16.140
And so there are alkaline fluids,

13:16.140 --> 13:19.300
hydrothermal fluids kind of winding their way

13:19.300 --> 13:22.420
through these interconnected pores.

13:22.420 --> 13:25.660
Now, they're not produced by the same mechanism

13:25.660 --> 13:27.860
that makes the black smoke events.

13:27.860 --> 13:30.940
The black smokers are produced by effectively direct interaction

13:30.940 --> 13:36.180
between magma, volcanic magma, and ocean water,

13:36.180 --> 13:40.100
at the spreading centres of the mid-ocean ridges and so on.

13:40.100 --> 13:43.180
What's happening here, we're away from this,

13:43.180 --> 13:48.860
and water will effectively percolate down into the sea floor.

13:48.860 --> 13:51.500
And if the sea floor is relatively close to the mantle,

13:51.580 --> 13:55.740
and this tends to happen these days close to the ridges,

13:55.740 --> 14:00.540
this is 15, 20 kilometres away from the mid-Atlantic ridge,

14:00.540 --> 14:03.580
these green minerals here, it's called olivine.

14:03.580 --> 14:09.340
It's actually the most common mineral in the Earth's mantle.

14:09.340 --> 14:12.660
It's also extremely common in distella space.

14:12.660 --> 14:15.780
It's called olivine just because it looks a bit like olives.

14:15.780 --> 14:18.300
It's really that simple.

14:18.300 --> 14:22.500
Water will percolate down as much as five or six kilometres

14:22.500 --> 14:25.340
underneath the sea floor and react with this olivine,

14:25.340 --> 14:26.900
and it's an exothermic reaction.

14:26.900 --> 14:31.660
It's releasing heat, and it's releasing these alkaline fluids,

14:31.660 --> 14:34.300
so they're warm and they're buoyant and they bubble back up,

14:34.300 --> 14:37.340
and plenty of hydrogen gas.

14:37.340 --> 14:40.860
And it's basically just the oxidation of water that's going on.

14:40.860 --> 14:44.620
Sorry, the oxidation of iron, so ferrous iron is going to ferric iron,

14:44.620 --> 14:48.300
and water is being converted into hydrogen.

14:48.300 --> 14:53.180
These same kind of vents should form on any wet rocky planet,

14:53.180 --> 14:56.220
and they happen on a global scale.

14:56.220 --> 15:00.020
So if this is the mid-Atlantic ridge,

15:00.020 --> 15:01.940
it would be somewhere around here,

15:01.940 --> 15:04.660
we have these reactions going on in the crust,

15:04.660 --> 15:06.900
and then now with tectonic spreading,

15:06.900 --> 15:11.260
it's spreading across the ocean floor and then being subducted down.

15:11.260 --> 15:14.420
In effect, what's happening is the water is reacting with the rock

15:14.420 --> 15:16.140
and hydrating the rock,

15:16.140 --> 15:18.940
and then this hydrated rock is being subducted,

15:18.940 --> 15:21.820
and at the increasing temperatures and pressures,

15:21.820 --> 15:24.020
water is being driven off again.

15:24.020 --> 15:26.580
And that water in the mantle is melting the mantle

15:26.580 --> 15:28.540
and causing convection currents in the mantle,

15:28.540 --> 15:31.460
and that is driving volcanic activity on the planet,

15:31.460 --> 15:33.740
on literally a planetary scale.

15:33.740 --> 15:36.700
So it's then quite interesting that Mars, for example,

15:36.700 --> 15:38.460
which is a fairly small planet,

15:38.460 --> 15:42.660
there's plenty of evidence that it had oceans four billion years ago,

15:42.740 --> 15:45.340
maybe three and a half billion years ago on Mars,

15:45.340 --> 15:47.060
and they disappeared,

15:47.060 --> 15:49.620
and there's various explanations for where they went,

15:49.620 --> 15:52.940
but one interesting explanation is this same process

15:52.940 --> 15:55.940
called serpentinisation,

15:55.940 --> 16:00.260
whereby the minerals like olivine react with water,

16:00.260 --> 16:01.820
get subducted down,

16:01.820 --> 16:04.700
but on a smaller planet which is cooling faster,

16:04.700 --> 16:08.980
the temperatures are cooler now because the core is cooling down,

16:08.980 --> 16:10.540
less of that water is driven off,

16:10.540 --> 16:15.140
and, effectively, Mars buried its oceans as rock,

16:15.140 --> 16:16.540
as hydrated rock,

16:16.540 --> 16:20.540
and that's one of the reasons why Mars, effectively,

16:20.540 --> 16:22.380
seems to have died as a planet.

16:22.380 --> 16:24.220
Maybe there's still life hanging on there,

16:24.220 --> 16:25.500
who knows, we'll find out,

16:25.500 --> 16:29.340
but it would be, to me, quite surprising if there was,

16:29.340 --> 16:32.660
and certainly it's not had any real impact on the atmosphere.

16:32.660 --> 16:35.020
Occasionally we see traces of methane,

16:35.020 --> 16:40.500
methane could also be produced by this process of serpentinisation.

16:40.980 --> 16:44.380
Incidentally, I didn't define serpentinisation,

16:44.380 --> 16:46.260
it sounds a bit intimidating.

16:46.260 --> 16:49.580
I say minerals like olivine are reacting with water

16:49.580 --> 16:51.140
and effectively rusting,

16:51.140 --> 16:54.860
and they're being converted into another mineral called serpentinite,

16:54.860 --> 16:56.980
and that's the process of serpentinisation,

16:56.980 --> 16:59.020
it's a metamorphosis.

16:59.020 --> 17:00.820
Why is it called serpentinite?

17:00.820 --> 17:03.420
Because it looks like a serpent's scales, again.

17:03.420 --> 17:05.620
The geologists have got these intimidating terms

17:05.620 --> 17:08.220
that just mean something very simple.

17:08.300 --> 17:11.420
We have a rock that looks like olives converted into a rock

17:11.420 --> 17:12.980
that looks like serpent's scales,

17:12.980 --> 17:14.580
it's called serpentinisation,

17:14.580 --> 17:16.060
and it happens throughout the universe.

17:16.060 --> 17:21.380
This is Enceladus, which is one of the moons of Saturn,

17:21.380 --> 17:25.300
and there are these plumes that were initially seen by Cassini

17:25.300 --> 17:27.380
on its fly past of Saturn.

17:28.500 --> 17:33.020
And these are alkaline, they're around about pH 9,

17:33.020 --> 17:35.020
they're rich in hydrogen and methane,

17:35.020 --> 17:37.500
and plenty of organic molecules in there.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.340
So, the interpretation of this is,

17:39.340 --> 17:42.860
beneath the frozen surface of Enceladus, there is a liquid ocean,

17:42.860 --> 17:45.660
and beneath that liquid ocean,

17:45.660 --> 17:51.620
there is a rocky, olivine-rich...

17:51.620 --> 17:55.140
I don't know what you call it, really, not exactly a mantle,

17:55.140 --> 17:57.500
I'm not sure, I'm not a geologist, what the term would be,

17:57.500 --> 18:01.620
but anyway, olivine-rich rock underneath the ocean,

18:01.620 --> 18:05.020
serpentinising giving rise to this alkaline ocean

18:05.020 --> 18:09.660
and the pressure is producing these plumes through cracks in the ice.

18:12.700 --> 18:17.500
This idea of planetary scale things going on,

18:17.500 --> 18:20.420
this is not a very exact analogy,

18:20.420 --> 18:23.100
but it's a very interesting analogy,

18:23.100 --> 18:26.260
that the structure of a cell, the topological structure of a cell,

18:26.260 --> 18:30.660
and the topological structure of a planet are very similar to each other.

18:30.660 --> 18:32.940
So, if this is the Earth, for example,

18:32.980 --> 18:35.940
the inside has a negative charge relative to the outside.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.940
All of the iron, which is buried down in the core,

18:38.940 --> 18:40.380
is effectively electron-rich,

18:40.380 --> 18:44.460
whereas the atmosphere, the oceans and so on, are relatively electron-poor.

18:44.460 --> 18:46.740
We have gases like carbon dioxide and so on,

18:46.740 --> 18:49.220
it's relatively oxidised outside.

18:49.220 --> 18:54.580
So, it's also relatively more acidic outside,

18:54.580 --> 18:57.020
this is slightly more problematic,

18:57.020 --> 19:02.500
but effectively, if you see these as hydrothermal vents

19:02.500 --> 19:04.540
between the mantle and the ocean,

19:04.540 --> 19:07.020
then we have alkaline fluids coming out,

19:07.020 --> 19:09.740
going into a relatively acidic early ocean.

19:09.740 --> 19:11.900
Now, a cell structure is basically the same,

19:11.900 --> 19:13.540
it's negatively charged inside,

19:13.540 --> 19:19.180
it's relatively reduced inside, plenty of electrons and protons on the outside.

19:19.180 --> 19:23.900
So, at a slightly hand-wavy level,

19:23.900 --> 19:27.860
there is an interesting topological equivalence between planets

19:27.860 --> 19:31.620
like the Earth, wet rocky planets, and the structure of cells.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.300
This was first noticed,

19:35.300 --> 19:37.020
I don't know if it's first noticed,

19:37.020 --> 19:40.780
but it was noticed and pointed out by a guy called Mike Russell,

19:40.780 --> 19:42.420
30 years ago now,

19:42.420 --> 19:47.620
and after the discovery of Lost City by Deb Kelly,

19:47.620 --> 19:51.300
his ideas became quite well-known.

19:51.300 --> 19:54.380
He predicted the existence of vents like Lost City

19:54.380 --> 19:56.220
10 years before their discovery,

19:56.220 --> 19:59.860
and his ideas throughout the 90s were pretty marginal in the field,

19:59.860 --> 20:01.460
nobody was very interested in them,

20:01.460 --> 20:04.300
and you can look back at conference proceedings

20:04.300 --> 20:07.140
and see the discussions after people's talks,

20:07.140 --> 20:09.020
and there would be Mike Russell jumping up and saying,

20:09.020 --> 20:11.020
yeah, but what about alkaline hydrothermal vents,

20:11.020 --> 20:12.140
and everybody would ignore him,

20:12.140 --> 20:14.900
and it was quite interesting to see this dynamic

20:14.900 --> 20:20.580
all written up in volumes of forgotten life sciences history.

20:20.580 --> 20:22.420
Then after the discovery of Lost City,

20:22.420 --> 20:24.100
he suddenly became much more famous,

20:24.100 --> 20:28.420
this was a feature article by Nature in the year 2009,

20:28.420 --> 20:31.180
and they photoshopped him up as Erasmus,

20:31.180 --> 20:33.300
as the Renaissance man,

20:33.300 --> 20:34.860
and they called him Naissance man,

20:34.860 --> 20:37.260
Naissance has in the birth of life,

20:37.260 --> 20:38.620
and this is his reactor,

20:38.620 --> 20:41.460
he was at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,

20:41.460 --> 20:44.500
and this is a little bit of Lost City behind him,

20:44.500 --> 20:46.700
and essentially what he was arguing,

20:46.700 --> 20:50.900
and what I still think to be the right way of seeing the question,

20:50.900 --> 20:53.620
is that there are high concentrations of hydrogen

20:53.620 --> 20:55.580
in these alkaline fluids,

20:55.580 --> 20:57.380
bubbling up into the ocean,

20:57.380 --> 21:00.980
and the oceans, the early oceans were CO2 rich,

21:00.980 --> 21:02.820
it's very hard to constrain how much,

21:02.820 --> 21:06.780
but probably as much as one bar of carbon dioxide in those early oceans,

21:06.780 --> 21:10.500
they would have been mildly acidic, perhaps pH 5 or 6,

21:10.500 --> 21:16.380
and that means this is the sponge-like,

21:16.380 --> 21:18.140
mineralised sponge-like structure,

21:18.140 --> 21:21.420
all of these interconnected micro pores.

21:21.420 --> 21:23.780
Four billion years ago, before there was any oxygen,

21:23.780 --> 21:25.740
this is now carbonate rocks,

21:25.740 --> 21:28.820
but we would expect to see lots of iron and nickel

21:28.820 --> 21:30.620
and transition metals in there as well,

21:30.620 --> 21:32.660
because these dissolved in the oceans

21:32.660 --> 21:34.540
before there was any oxygen around,

21:34.540 --> 21:36.420
especially in acidic oceans.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.740
So we would expect to see some of these walls

21:38.740 --> 21:43.740
effectively containing catalytic transition metals and equivalents.

21:43.740 --> 21:46.220
And so reactive fluids percolating,

21:46.220 --> 21:48.700
wending their way through, ocean waters coming in,

21:48.700 --> 21:53.380
this is really an electrochemical flow reactor,

21:53.380 --> 21:56.140
where we've got the two components that I was saying earlier on,

21:56.140 --> 21:57.460
make up the Krebs cycle,

21:57.460 --> 22:01.220
are the first starting point for life hydrogen and CO2

22:01.220 --> 22:05.460
being forcibly reacted together with natural proton gradients,

22:05.460 --> 22:08.180
which is to say differences in the proton concentration

22:08.180 --> 22:10.740
between the ocean waters and the alkaline fluids,

22:10.740 --> 22:12.660
probably across these barriers,

22:12.660 --> 22:15.100
across potentially quite short distances.

22:15.100 --> 22:16.340
So we've got a system here,

22:16.340 --> 22:19.420
which has a structure which is reminiscent of cells,

22:19.420 --> 22:21.620
and we've got all the right ingredients

22:21.620 --> 22:25.980
to be reacting together to make the components of cells.

22:26.060 --> 22:27.820
So at least you can imagine

22:27.820 --> 22:34.020
that this may be a suitable starting point for life.

22:34.020 --> 22:37.900
So this is my hypothesis,

22:37.900 --> 22:39.620
which is grounded in the work of the people

22:39.620 --> 22:41.100
that I've been talking about,

22:41.100 --> 22:43.780
but I'm not sure any of them would necessarily see it quite this way,

22:43.780 --> 22:46.340
and I wouldn't have dared to show anybody this slide

22:46.340 --> 22:48.220
even five or six years ago.

22:48.220 --> 22:51.940
It's very simple, and I'll explain it briefly,

22:51.940 --> 22:54.380
but I wouldn't have dared to say it

22:54.380 --> 22:57.980
because there's big claims going on here,

22:57.980 --> 23:01.420
and they're experimentally tractable questions,

23:01.420 --> 23:03.420
and the reason I dare to show it to you now

23:03.420 --> 23:05.980
is that a lot of them are beginning to show signs

23:05.980 --> 23:07.380
that there's truth in them.

23:07.380 --> 23:09.020
So imagine this is a paw

23:09.020 --> 23:10.380
in one of these hydrothermal vents.

23:10.380 --> 23:13.060
We've got acidic ocean waters percolating in.

23:13.060 --> 23:16.860
We've got iron sulfur minerals in these barriers,

23:16.860 --> 23:19.940
not just that, or silicate and carbonate and things as well,

23:19.940 --> 23:21.980
but some iron sulfur minerals,

23:21.980 --> 23:24.660
driving a reaction between hydrogen and CO2,

23:24.660 --> 23:26.620
not necessarily a complete Krebs cycle,

23:26.620 --> 23:29.740
but at least some of these intermediates in the Krebs cycle,

23:29.740 --> 23:32.060
to make the most thermodynamically-favoured products.

23:32.060 --> 23:35.140
Lipids, which is to say fatty acids,

23:35.140 --> 23:39.980
long-chain hydrocarbons, and amino acids.

23:39.980 --> 23:45.140
These are the two most thermodynamically-favoured groups.

23:45.140 --> 23:48.380
If we did make lipids, we potentially would expect

23:48.460 --> 23:50.380
that they would form some kind of a...

23:50.380 --> 23:52.980
I'm going to call it a proto-cell.

23:52.980 --> 23:56.580
It's got a bilayer membrane around it, and it's snuggling in.

23:56.580 --> 23:59.220
I'm showing it deliberately snuggling into a paw here.

23:59.220 --> 24:02.140
I'm exaggerating, but this, effectively,

24:02.140 --> 24:05.140
this paw is templating a cell,

24:05.140 --> 24:08.420
and the cell is snuggling in with a bilayer membrane around it,

24:08.420 --> 24:11.340
and now it's a semi-closed system, and we can make more things,

24:11.340 --> 24:15.420
not just lipids and amino acids, but also sugars, maybe nucleotides.

24:15.420 --> 24:19.540
For this to be happening, we need that bit.

24:19.540 --> 24:22.500
This iron-sulfur mineral.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.500
Well, if we want to be fixing these things inside a proto-cell,

24:25.500 --> 24:28.340
then this needs to be sticking in this membrane.

24:28.340 --> 24:30.660
Protons need to be crossing that membrane.

24:30.660 --> 24:34.100
We need to have all this happening inside, and a continuous flow.

24:34.100 --> 24:36.220
So we're combining the structure of the vent

24:36.220 --> 24:38.940
with the continuous flow of things.

24:38.940 --> 24:42.500
And this, I hope, will be beginning to challenge you,

24:42.540 --> 24:44.620
because, certainly, I would be thinking,

24:44.620 --> 24:48.140
well, really, can we really believe that that's true?

24:48.140 --> 24:50.460
And then, just as a final challenge,

24:50.460 --> 24:52.860
if we can get as far as nucleotides,

24:52.860 --> 24:55.300
then we can begin to have RNA.

24:55.300 --> 24:57.580
We can begin to have a kind of an RNA world,

24:57.580 --> 25:01.020
but inside these growing proto-cells,

25:01.020 --> 25:03.220
and now we've got amino acids becoming peptides,

25:03.220 --> 25:05.580
we've got RNA,

25:05.580 --> 25:09.300
which is the kind of more reactive equivalent of DNA

25:09.300 --> 25:12.260
if you're not so familiar with these things.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.580
And the beginnings of making proteins,

25:14.580 --> 25:15.900
the beginnings of information,

25:15.900 --> 25:19.660
and the beginnings of real protein function in cells.

25:19.660 --> 25:21.780
So it's a very simple hypothesis,

25:21.780 --> 25:25.540
and it really challenges our ability

25:25.540 --> 25:28.260
to believe our own hypotheses in science,

25:28.260 --> 25:32.980
but the good thing is it is eminently testable.

25:32.980 --> 25:34.220
So I'm going to run through,

25:34.220 --> 25:36.820
and I'm going to show you a little bit of data with some of this,

25:36.820 --> 25:38.460
and I kind of apologise for that

25:38.460 --> 25:40.020
because it's not supposed to be a seminar,

25:40.020 --> 25:42.660
but at the same time, if I just stand here and wave my arms around

25:42.660 --> 25:45.260
and say, yeah, take it from me, it's really going to happen,

25:45.260 --> 25:46.780
you really should not believe me.

25:46.780 --> 25:49.260
So I'm going to show you that we can do some experiments,

25:49.260 --> 25:51.980
that this is actually science,

25:51.980 --> 25:54.860
and I'll show you the kind of experiments that we can do.

25:54.860 --> 25:56.660
I'm going to skim over them quite lightly,

25:56.660 --> 25:59.380
and if you've got questions, feel free to either interrupt

25:59.380 --> 26:03.500
and ask as I'm going along, or ask at the end.

26:03.500 --> 26:08.220
Anyway, so this idea that life is powered by electric membranes,

26:08.220 --> 26:11.820
it goes back to 1961,

26:11.820 --> 26:15.180
to a paper from Peter Mitchell in 1961

26:15.180 --> 26:17.980
on what he called the chemiosmotic hypothesis,

26:17.980 --> 26:21.380
and this is an older picture, and it's with Jennifer Moyle,

26:21.380 --> 26:27.020
and Jennifer Moyle, she was working with Mitchell from 1947,

26:27.020 --> 26:29.260
this is 1947 in Cambridge,

26:29.260 --> 26:32.380
and she was a brilliant experimentalist,

26:32.380 --> 26:36.060
and most of the good papers that they wrote together in the 1960s

26:36.060 --> 26:37.380
on the chemiosmotic hypothesis

26:37.460 --> 26:40.100
is the best papers were Mitchell and Moyle together,

26:40.100 --> 26:42.700
and she did all the experimental work.

26:42.700 --> 26:44.940
Mitchell was a brilliant theoretician,

26:44.940 --> 26:46.740
he was cac-handed in the lab,

26:46.740 --> 26:48.340
he could never finish an experiment,

26:48.340 --> 26:50.940
it was Moyle that really did the experimental work,

26:50.940 --> 26:53.940
and Mitchell, of course, perhaps you don't know,

26:53.940 --> 26:59.220
but Mitchell in 1978 was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry by himself,

26:59.220 --> 27:00.900
I'm increasingly thinking,

27:00.900 --> 27:04.340
and I've been kind of digging around in the literature,

27:04.420 --> 27:07.580
but I think now, if that were to happen,

27:07.580 --> 27:09.540
then Moyle would have won the Nobel Prize with him,

27:09.540 --> 27:11.740
I think luckily times are changing,

27:11.740 --> 27:14.660
but I think that was a miscarriage of justice.

27:14.660 --> 27:19.540
Anyway, before this hypothesis was first published in 1961,

27:19.540 --> 27:23.100
Mitchell was a conference in Moscow, 1957,

27:23.100 --> 27:25.740
on the origin of life, it was organised by Oparin,

27:25.740 --> 27:31.220
who was a great Soviet, I suppose he was a chemist,

27:31.220 --> 27:33.060
interested in the origin of life,

27:33.060 --> 27:35.940
and a lot of the great scientists in the world at the time,

27:35.940 --> 27:38.500
so people like J.V.S. Haldane was there,

27:39.620 --> 27:43.460
and Mitchell himself was there as well,

27:43.460 --> 27:45.380
and J.D. Bernal was there,

27:45.380 --> 27:46.420
a lot of them were communists,

27:46.420 --> 27:49.780
which was why they went to Moscow and why they were interested,

27:49.780 --> 27:55.060
but it's also interesting that because there's such a materialistic basis

27:55.060 --> 27:57.740
to Marxism and communism,

27:57.740 --> 28:00.900
they were interested in questions like the origin of life

28:00.900 --> 28:02.740
in a way that many other people weren't at the time,

28:02.740 --> 28:05.700
so there's a reason why it was happening in Moscow.

28:06.900 --> 28:12.580
Mitchell really was not a communist really at all,

28:13.460 --> 28:15.500
in fact, he was from a very wealthy family,

28:15.500 --> 28:18.940
and he used to drive a silver Rolls Royce around Cambridge

28:18.940 --> 28:20.700
during the war time,

28:21.420 --> 28:24.980
and this is quite a poetic view here,

28:24.980 --> 28:28.140
I love this quote because it's eye-opening

28:28.140 --> 28:29.580
when you think about the origin of life,

28:29.580 --> 28:33.340
he says, I cannot consider the organism without its environment.

28:33.340 --> 28:34.300
From a formal point of view,

28:34.300 --> 28:37.420
the two may be regarded as equivalent phases

28:37.420 --> 28:39.580
between which dynamic contact is maintained

28:39.580 --> 28:42.180
by the membranes that separate and link them.

28:43.580 --> 28:47.900
So the inside of a cell in the outside world are equivalent phases.

28:47.900 --> 28:51.420
He's not separating life out and saying this is what life is

28:51.420 --> 28:52.620
and this is what the environment is,

28:52.620 --> 28:53.780
he's conflating them,

28:53.780 --> 28:56.460
he's saying they're equivalent to each other,

28:56.460 --> 28:57.940
which is a strange thing to say,

28:57.940 --> 28:59.300
but if you're thinking about the origin of life

28:59.300 --> 29:01.980
before there is such a thing as a cell that we would recognise,

29:01.980 --> 29:04.980
before there is really an organism or a living system,

29:04.980 --> 29:06.860
thinking about phases as your equivalent

29:06.860 --> 29:09.460
separated and joined by a membrane

29:09.460 --> 29:12.060
is a very productive way of thinking about the question.

29:13.700 --> 29:16.420
And this is, to my mind,

29:16.420 --> 29:18.780
what we have in a hydrothermal vent,

29:18.780 --> 29:20.460
we have a barrier,

29:20.460 --> 29:23.540
and we have alkaline hydrothermal fluids inside,

29:23.540 --> 29:26.060
and we have acidic ocean waters on the outside,

29:26.140 --> 29:28.940
and so the topology is equivalent to a bacterial cell.

29:28.940 --> 29:30.060
Here's a bacterial cell.

29:30.060 --> 29:32.300
We're pumping out protons,

29:32.300 --> 29:34.580
and so it's relatively acidic on the outside

29:34.580 --> 29:36.420
and it's relatively alkaline on the inside,

29:36.420 --> 29:39.860
and potentially it's three pH units difference

29:39.860 --> 29:41.220
between the inside and the outside.

29:41.220 --> 29:46.140
So it's the same magnitude and it's the same topology as a cell.

29:46.140 --> 29:49.980
So is there any way that we can kind of go from here to there?

29:49.980 --> 29:51.180
The other thing to notice about this,

29:51.180 --> 29:54.740
we're pumping out protons all the time in our own body,

29:54.740 --> 29:56.540
but why?

29:56.540 --> 29:59.620
Because we're putting them to work, to power work,

29:59.620 --> 30:02.100
and so the influx of protons is driving work,

30:02.100 --> 30:04.340
and the influx of protons across here

30:04.340 --> 30:06.540
could potentially drive work as well.

30:08.100 --> 30:10.060
What kind of work could it potentially do?

30:10.060 --> 30:13.380
Before there are any enzymes, any genes,

30:13.380 --> 30:16.180
any kind of structures that you would think

30:16.180 --> 30:18.300
could do anything useful,

30:18.300 --> 30:19.780
what on earth could it actually do?

30:19.780 --> 30:22.100
Well, there is a simple answer,

30:22.100 --> 30:25.660
and it's basically about driving growth.

30:25.660 --> 30:27.140
Why would that happen?

30:27.140 --> 30:29.260
The problem with hydrogen and CO2

30:29.260 --> 30:31.420
is they're just not very reactive.

30:31.420 --> 30:34.500
The first couple of steps to get them to react

30:34.500 --> 30:35.820
is really difficult,

30:35.820 --> 30:38.180
and so if you were to just take a mixture of gases,

30:38.180 --> 30:40.100
hydrogen and CO2, and put them in a test tube

30:40.100 --> 30:41.500
and heat them up to say 50 degrees

30:41.500 --> 30:43.620
and shake them up for half a billion years,

30:43.620 --> 30:46.100
nothing much is really going to happen.

30:46.100 --> 30:49.300
Actually, thermodynamically, you should get cells.

30:49.300 --> 30:50.660
Incredibly, you should get cells.

30:50.660 --> 30:53.100
They are more thermodynamically favored

30:53.100 --> 30:56.060
than just a mixture of hydrogen and CO2.

30:56.060 --> 30:58.500
The problem is this first couple of steps

30:58.500 --> 31:01.220
to get to formaldehyde is uphill.

31:01.220 --> 31:05.700
We don't need to go into the details of redox chemistry.

31:05.700 --> 31:07.860
All you really need to notice is it's uphill

31:07.860 --> 31:10.460
and it's quite steeply uphill to get them to react.

31:10.460 --> 31:13.260
But that is at the same pH.

31:13.260 --> 31:15.220
What we actually have in a hydrothermal vent

31:15.220 --> 31:17.860
is the alkaline fluids at pH 11

31:17.860 --> 31:21.700
and the acidic ocean waters, let's say pH 6.

31:21.700 --> 31:24.140
And now you can see it's downhill.

31:24.140 --> 31:25.700
Why is it downhill?

31:25.700 --> 31:28.660
It's quite simple, again, intuitively to understand.

31:28.660 --> 31:30.420
If you imagine hydrogen gas,

31:30.420 --> 31:33.060
it wants to pass its electrons onto something else.

31:33.060 --> 31:35.300
That leaves behind the protons,

31:35.300 --> 31:37.740
and the protons, well, that's what makes an acid.

31:37.740 --> 31:41.980
So an acid is rich in protons.

31:41.980 --> 31:44.860
If you make those protons in an alkaline environment,

31:44.860 --> 31:47.220
they'll immediately react with hydroxide to form water.

31:47.220 --> 31:48.620
It's a neutralisation reaction.

31:48.620 --> 31:51.820
It's extremely rapid, it's thermodynamically favoured.

31:51.820 --> 31:55.140
It's going to happen instantaneously and release a lot of heat.

31:55.140 --> 31:57.020
So it's just a neutralisation.

31:57.020 --> 31:59.700
If you try to release protons in an acidic environment,

31:59.700 --> 32:01.380
well, you're making an acid more acid,

32:01.380 --> 32:04.940
that's not really favoured in terms of chemistry.

32:04.940 --> 32:07.300
So it's going to be much more reactive

32:07.300 --> 32:08.740
in an alkaline environment.

32:08.740 --> 32:11.020
And CO2, well, it picks up an electron,

32:11.020 --> 32:12.460
now it's got a negative charge.

32:12.460 --> 32:13.860
If it's in an acidic environment,

32:13.860 --> 32:15.180
it can pick up a proton now.

32:15.180 --> 32:17.420
It's balanced the charges now, another electron now,

32:17.420 --> 32:19.900
another proton, and off we go, we can make it.

32:19.900 --> 32:22.140
So it becomes easier.

32:22.140 --> 32:25.820
CO2 becomes more reactive in an acidic environment.

32:25.820 --> 32:28.500
And so its downhill is going to happen

32:28.500 --> 32:32.900
so long as we have hydrogen in one phase at pH 11

32:32.900 --> 32:35.660
and CO2 in a different phase at pH 6,

32:35.660 --> 32:37.980
and they're not constantly mixing.

32:37.980 --> 32:41.140
They're not just forming the same thing.

32:41.140 --> 32:43.740
So that's what we have in these vents.

32:43.740 --> 32:45.380
And this is a fairly simple experiment.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.020
Actually, we've been building reactors

32:47.020 --> 32:49.180
and trying to make these things react for quite a long time

32:49.180 --> 32:50.780
and embarrassingly long time.

32:50.780 --> 32:52.060
And it's got smaller and smaller

32:52.060 --> 32:53.380
and more and more controllable.

32:53.380 --> 32:55.780
And this is a microfluidic chip.

32:55.780 --> 32:57.380
You can see it there as well.

32:57.380 --> 33:01.220
Inside this anaerobic glove box.

33:01.220 --> 33:07.420
And we have parallel flow, acidic flow with iron chloride

33:07.420 --> 33:09.380
and alkaline flow with sodium sulfide.

33:09.380 --> 33:12.460
And it precipitates this very thin barrier.

33:12.540 --> 33:15.220
And what we're hoping is that protons or maybe electrons

33:15.220 --> 33:18.060
when still not sure which, unbelievably,

33:18.060 --> 33:21.340
will cross this barrier and reduce CO2

33:21.340 --> 33:23.500
to make organic molecules.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.300
Does it work?

33:24.300 --> 33:25.260
Well, yes it does.

33:25.260 --> 33:29.620
It's not hugely impressive, I have to admit.

33:29.620 --> 33:31.620
It's taken a long time even to get to this.

33:31.620 --> 33:35.500
This is the kind of thing, if you're not a scientist,

33:35.500 --> 33:38.460
then maybe this will help you understand.

33:38.460 --> 33:42.140
People get amazingly excited about that.

33:42.140 --> 33:44.380
That is formate.

33:44.380 --> 33:47.020
Which is to say, it's the very first step

33:47.020 --> 33:48.740
of reacting hydrogen and CO2

33:48.740 --> 33:51.620
to make the very first product.

33:51.620 --> 33:53.780
So it's a step in the right direction.

33:53.780 --> 33:56.620
And it's sticking up quite a long way above this baseline.

33:56.620 --> 33:59.300
Sometimes this baseline is quite lumpy and bumpy

33:59.300 --> 34:01.980
and so this is not a bad peak really.

34:01.980 --> 34:06.580
And so it's proof that it can begin to happen.

34:06.580 --> 34:12.660
And over here, this one is acetate,

34:12.660 --> 34:14.700
which is two carbons joined together.

34:14.700 --> 34:16.540
And we've managed to get three carbons joined together

34:16.540 --> 34:20.220
and you'll probably be thinking, wow, well done.

34:20.220 --> 34:24.420
But it's taken us 10 years.

34:24.420 --> 34:26.940
It's a bit embarrassing, as I say.

34:26.940 --> 34:29.700
Other people have gone much further

34:29.700 --> 34:31.860
but they've very often used higher pressures

34:31.860 --> 34:34.220
and all kinds of interesting minerals.

34:34.220 --> 34:36.180
This is with very freshly precipitated

34:36.180 --> 34:37.300
with just a pH gradient.

34:37.300 --> 34:39.380
And if you cut out the pH gradient,

34:39.380 --> 34:41.140
it doesn't work, you don't get anything.

34:41.140 --> 34:43.580
If you cut out some of the transition metals like nickel,

34:43.580 --> 34:44.940
it doesn't work, you don't get anything.

34:44.940 --> 34:49.340
So even though it looks incredibly cheap,

34:49.340 --> 34:51.380
it is actually quite exciting.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.420
It's a proof of concept that a pH gradient across a barrier

34:54.420 --> 34:58.540
will drive CO2 fixation and make the organic molecules.

34:58.540 --> 35:01.580
And notice acetate, it's actually one of the Krebs cycle.

35:01.580 --> 35:03.900
And the reverse Krebs cycle is one of the intermediates,

35:03.900 --> 35:08.420
one of the universally conserved intermediates.

35:08.420 --> 35:11.340
Now, I said other people have done more than we have.

35:11.340 --> 35:13.140
We're now talking higher temperatures

35:13.140 --> 35:14.780
and higher pressures and things like that.

35:14.780 --> 35:18.980
But some people have produced longer chain fatty acids

35:18.980 --> 35:21.100
doing that.

35:21.100 --> 35:24.260
And they'd done that 20 years ago, actually,

35:24.260 --> 35:25.980
not using pH gradients.

35:25.980 --> 35:29.140
And we'd taken a selection of these and tried to see,

35:29.140 --> 35:31.700
well, if you remember my picture,

35:31.700 --> 35:37.700
I was showing you a proto cell nestling snugly inside a pore.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.340
Well, that requires a bilayer membrane,

35:39.340 --> 35:41.180
and that requires something really simple.

35:41.180 --> 35:43.700
And so the question is, if we take these fatty acids that

35:43.700 --> 35:46.820
have been made and something called fatty alcohols, which

35:46.820 --> 35:49.540
also is kind of a long chain of covens joined together

35:49.540 --> 35:52.060
with an alcohol group stuck on the end,

35:52.060 --> 35:53.740
do we get things that look like proto cells?

35:53.740 --> 35:56.980
And the answer is yes, this is cryoelectron microscopy,

35:56.980 --> 35:59.820
and it's got a bilayer membrane around an aqueous space

35:59.820 --> 36:01.420
inside these similar things.

36:01.420 --> 36:07.460
This is confocal microscopy, and I think this one is at pH 7,

36:07.460 --> 36:10.540
but this one's at pH 12, and these are also at pH 12.

36:10.540 --> 36:13.780
So we are able to make them, and they

36:13.780 --> 36:17.780
make stable proto cells quite beautiful to look at.

36:17.780 --> 36:19.820
When you see them live, as it were,

36:19.820 --> 36:22.020
they're moving around and doing interesting things.

36:22.020 --> 36:24.580
They're quite dynamic.

36:24.580 --> 36:28.660
So yes, and the question there was, well,

36:28.660 --> 36:31.940
are they stable in these harsh conditions in a hydrothermal vent

36:31.940 --> 36:36.420
at 70 degrees centigrade and pH 9 or 10 or 11,

36:36.420 --> 36:40.900
and lots of salt and calcium and magnesium and all the rest of it?

36:40.900 --> 36:43.420
And the answer is yes, that has all of those things in.

36:43.420 --> 36:48.940
So it is quite easy to make them, it turns out.

36:48.940 --> 36:52.300
And this, I'm not going to go through the details here,

36:52.300 --> 36:56.060
but this is another thing where scientists get ridiculously

36:56.060 --> 37:00.980
excited about, let's say, that, this little shoulder here.

37:00.980 --> 37:03.820
This is what's called UV-viz spectroscopy,

37:03.820 --> 37:08.860
and that shoulder is diagnostic of what are called 4FE4S clusters,

37:08.860 --> 37:12.860
which is a kind of little cube of iron and sulfur.

37:12.860 --> 37:15.020
And they're found in some of the most important proteins

37:15.020 --> 37:17.300
in biology, things like ferrodoxin, which

37:17.300 --> 37:21.740
are directly doing CO2 fixation in pretty much all cells.

37:21.740 --> 37:25.140
These are ancient proteins, and they always contain these little cubes

37:25.140 --> 37:29.020
of iron and sulfur, and they're like minerals.

37:29.020 --> 37:31.700
And actually, they're formed in the same way as minerals,

37:31.700 --> 37:32.900
they form spontaneously.

37:32.900 --> 37:35.020
And so this is the kind of the machinery,

37:35.020 --> 37:37.700
this is the most simple machinery you could imagine for CO2

37:37.700 --> 37:40.740
fixation, which is becoming biology.

37:40.740 --> 37:43.460
And they have a diagnostic shoulder on UV-viz spectroscopy.

37:43.460 --> 37:45.780
So as soon as you see this, you think, whoa,

37:45.780 --> 37:51.980
we expected that we would mix iron chloride and sodium sulfide

37:51.980 --> 37:56.140
and cystin, the amino acid cystin, at pH 9, and we mix it up.

37:56.140 --> 38:01.540
And what I thought we would see would be smaller crystals, big things,

38:01.540 --> 38:04.780
but getting smaller coated in cystin.

38:04.780 --> 38:06.740
That's kind of what I expected to see.

38:06.740 --> 38:09.220
I didn't expect to see that.

38:09.220 --> 38:12.820
Suddenly, we've gone from when you do it without the cystin,

38:12.820 --> 38:14.260
everything goes black.

38:14.260 --> 38:18.220
You just form the mineral, you just form iron sulfide minerals,

38:18.220 --> 38:19.860
and everything goes black.

38:19.860 --> 38:22.740
And when we first started doing these experiments quite a while ago

38:22.740 --> 38:26.780
now, the first PhD student I had,

38:26.780 --> 38:28.980
she became terribly depressed in the first month or two

38:28.980 --> 38:31.740
because every experiment just went black every time.

38:31.740 --> 38:34.540
It was nothing, it took a long time to figure out

38:34.540 --> 38:37.500
we need alkaline pH, and we need all the, you know.

38:37.500 --> 38:40.500
So surprisingly, again, surprisingly long time,

38:40.500 --> 38:43.220
and eventually we get through to forming these,

38:43.220 --> 38:46.020
it depends on the amount of cystin that you have,

38:46.020 --> 38:47.660
it depends on the concentration of iron,

38:47.660 --> 38:50.300
and I won't go through the details of these.

38:50.300 --> 38:52.500
Here's what these little clusters look like.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.620
That is this that I showed you.

38:54.620 --> 38:57.980
This is from my original slide that I showed you.

38:57.980 --> 39:01.140
So what I'm saying is it's quite easy to make

39:01.140 --> 39:02.820
the bilayer membrane surrounding it,

39:02.820 --> 39:07.620
and it's quite easy to make these little clusters of iron and sulfide

39:07.620 --> 39:10.180
that are doing CO2 fixation in modern cells.

39:10.180 --> 39:13.060
They have exactly the same chemistry.

39:13.060 --> 39:15.180
And they will fix CO2.

39:15.180 --> 39:16.860
This is formate, and this is acetate,

39:16.860 --> 39:18.580
and again, I won't go through the details,

39:18.580 --> 39:21.060
but the green one here is just pure water.

39:21.060 --> 39:23.100
This is done on an electrode,

39:23.100 --> 39:25.380
so there is an electrical potential here as well,

39:25.380 --> 39:28.260
but when we have the clusters, we get an awful lot more

39:28.260 --> 39:31.020
than you get in the absence of the clusters.

39:31.020 --> 39:32.300
So again, it does work.

39:32.300 --> 39:36.740
We can effectively build this machinery that life uses

39:36.740 --> 39:39.260
with the most simple imaginable ingredients.

39:40.380 --> 39:43.900
Okay, so that's effectively turning gases

39:43.900 --> 39:47.020
into the core molecules of life.

39:47.020 --> 39:48.620
What happens next?

39:48.620 --> 39:50.340
Well, metabolism.

39:50.340 --> 39:53.140
This is a tube map of metabolism,

39:53.140 --> 39:55.460
the kind of London underground.

39:55.460 --> 39:59.700
The remarkable thing about it is that this basic topology

39:59.700 --> 40:02.700
is again, it's conserved across all of life.

40:02.700 --> 40:04.180
You don't need to worry about the details,

40:04.180 --> 40:07.140
but that kind of map, it's like,

40:07.140 --> 40:09.980
imagine that you go to Paris

40:09.980 --> 40:12.620
and you look at the underground map in Paris

40:12.620 --> 40:14.220
and you find it's exactly the same

40:14.220 --> 40:16.220
as the underground map in London.

40:16.220 --> 40:18.220
And you go to New York,

40:18.220 --> 40:20.900
and it's exactly, it's not the same conceptory.

40:20.900 --> 40:22.780
It's got the same stations.

40:22.780 --> 40:23.620
It's incredible.

40:23.620 --> 40:25.460
Everything is exactly the same.

40:25.460 --> 40:26.980
What's happening down these is,

40:26.980 --> 40:29.580
not as if you've just got some kind of flow going down.

40:29.580 --> 40:32.300
What's really happening is each of these molecules

40:32.300 --> 40:34.900
is converting into another molecule.

40:34.900 --> 40:37.860
So this is the kind of the line going from pyruvate

40:37.860 --> 40:41.020
through to valine, for example, or to alanine.

40:41.980 --> 40:46.020
These are molecules being converted into other things.

40:46.020 --> 40:50.460
So it's not very equivalent to a tube map in that sense,

40:50.460 --> 40:56.340
but it's remarkable that the genes that code for this map,

40:56.340 --> 40:58.300
they're not the same.

40:58.300 --> 40:59.900
I mean, some of them are the same,

40:59.900 --> 41:01.860
but most of them are different in, for example,

41:01.860 --> 41:05.900
bacteria and archaea, two of the domains of life.

41:05.900 --> 41:09.140
And what that suggests is that this tube map

41:09.460 --> 41:12.020
is actually older than the genes.

41:12.020 --> 41:14.220
Now, again, that's something of an assertion,

41:14.220 --> 41:16.180
but what it suggests then is that a lot of it

41:16.180 --> 41:17.380
should happen spontaneously,

41:17.380 --> 41:20.140
that we should be able to just do this chemistry in the lab

41:20.140 --> 41:22.340
without there being any enzymes there,

41:22.340 --> 41:23.700
any genetic programming there,

41:23.700 --> 41:26.500
nothing which should just happen spontaneously

41:26.500 --> 41:27.820
in the right environment.

41:28.740 --> 41:31.020
And this is just one example showing more or less that.

41:31.020 --> 41:33.100
We're starting with, let me just go back a moment,

41:33.100 --> 41:36.420
oxaloacetate, which is here, so we're just feeding it this.

41:37.260 --> 41:38.940
And we're looking to see if we get a spartate.

41:38.940 --> 41:40.420
This is a very difficult reaction

41:40.420 --> 41:42.900
and has never been done before.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.460
And what we're also seeing,

41:44.460 --> 41:47.260
we're seeing alanine and pyruvate and glycine and serine.

41:47.260 --> 41:50.420
So this is alanine.

41:50.420 --> 41:52.500
These are different metal ions that we're using,

41:52.500 --> 41:54.900
so I won't spend much time on the details.

41:54.900 --> 41:57.260
We're getting not large amounts,

41:57.260 --> 42:01.540
but hundreds of micro molar with copper and with ferric iron,

42:01.540 --> 42:02.860
but nothing with those.

42:02.860 --> 42:04.020
A spartate is quite hard,

42:04.020 --> 42:06.340
but some metal ions do the job.

42:06.340 --> 42:09.460
But we're also getting glycine and serine and alanine.

42:10.420 --> 42:12.460
And this was on GCMS.

42:12.460 --> 42:14.260
This is just what we measured,

42:14.260 --> 42:18.060
which means that we've got this flow going through this system.

42:18.060 --> 42:19.780
And it's not coming out with other things.

42:19.780 --> 42:22.220
We are, it's like the train is following the lines

42:22.220 --> 42:24.140
even in the absence of any gene.

42:24.140 --> 42:25.900
So it's not much, but it's there.

42:25.900 --> 42:29.420
And we've also got through as far as cysteine, for example,

42:29.420 --> 42:31.700
so all the way through to here,

42:31.700 --> 42:35.340
which is what's binding those iron sulfur clusters.

42:35.340 --> 42:36.780
So this is early days.

42:36.780 --> 42:38.700
There's another group in Strasbourg

42:38.700 --> 42:41.420
who's done more of this kind of work than we have.

42:41.420 --> 42:44.220
They've managed to do pretty much all of the Krebs cycle,

42:44.220 --> 42:46.620
pretty much most of this pathway coming down here.

42:46.620 --> 42:49.660
And now we've also done sugar synthesis

42:49.660 --> 42:52.020
coming through to ribose and so on.

42:52.020 --> 42:54.100
A lot of this map has been done in the lab

42:54.100 --> 42:58.140
in the last 10 years, since 2015, eight years.

42:59.220 --> 43:00.220
And it works.

43:00.220 --> 43:02.100
Not everyone's done it under the same conditions.

43:02.100 --> 43:04.260
It's not as if we start here and just go whoosh

43:04.260 --> 43:06.140
right the way through this whole system.

43:06.140 --> 43:09.060
One group does this little bit, another group does that bit,

43:09.060 --> 43:10.980
someone else does this bit.

43:10.980 --> 43:14.140
But it's interesting that piecing it together,

43:14.140 --> 43:16.060
it seems to be spontaneous chemistry.

43:16.060 --> 43:18.780
It's a lot harder to try and get flow going through

43:18.780 --> 43:21.900
the entire system that could date years,

43:21.900 --> 43:23.420
possibly decades, who knows.

43:23.420 --> 43:26.660
But at least it begins to give you a little faith,

43:26.660 --> 43:30.420
I would say, that this kind of chemistry is really possible.

43:30.420 --> 43:32.420
Think about the earlier four billion years ago.

43:32.420 --> 43:37.140
We've got an entire planet covered in hydrothermal vents,

43:37.140 --> 43:38.580
covered in these hydrothermal systems.

43:38.580 --> 43:40.980
There was no distinction between the crust and the mantle

43:40.980 --> 43:44.220
at that time, so these vent systems were everywhere.

43:44.220 --> 43:46.260
And how many million years do you want?

43:46.260 --> 43:50.780
So the idea that in the scope of a PhD thesis

43:50.780 --> 43:53.820
on a bench top in a small lab,

43:53.820 --> 43:56.020
which is always struggling to get funded,

43:56.020 --> 43:57.820
that we can make all of this stuff happen,

43:57.820 --> 43:59.540
of course it's not going to happen.

43:59.540 --> 44:02.260
If we can get anything to happen at all,

44:02.260 --> 44:03.340
it's a step in the direction.

44:03.340 --> 44:06.460
So I think again, to return to my point at the beginning,

44:06.460 --> 44:08.500
intellectually we're beginning to get a feel

44:08.500 --> 44:11.900
for how this kind of chemistry might work out.

44:11.900 --> 44:14.100
And we're beginning to do the experiments

44:14.100 --> 44:16.260
that suggest that it's not completely impossible.

44:16.260 --> 44:18.180
It's not utterly improbable.

44:19.380 --> 44:21.980
This was showing that we can make uracil,

44:21.980 --> 44:24.780
which is one of the letters in RNA and DNA.

44:24.780 --> 44:26.180
This is not too many steps,

44:26.180 --> 44:28.500
but we start with ammonia and carbonate and aspartate,

44:28.500 --> 44:30.180
and we can go right the way through there.

44:30.260 --> 44:33.460
This is uracil and oratate as a one-pot synthesis.

44:33.460 --> 44:36.140
And when we optimize the conditions,

44:36.140 --> 44:38.100
we got about 10 times as much uracil,

44:38.100 --> 44:40.860
just in these last three steps here.

44:40.860 --> 44:43.940
And interestingly, those conditions turned out to be

44:43.940 --> 44:46.780
90 degrees centigrade, pH 8.5,

44:46.780 --> 44:49.860
one molar sodium chloride.

44:49.860 --> 44:52.740
So quite similar to alkaline hydrothermal vents.

44:52.740 --> 44:55.460
So again, this is just showing that whole pathways

44:55.460 --> 44:57.860
can spontaneously happen.

44:57.860 --> 44:58.980
And this is an interesting one.

44:58.980 --> 45:01.020
This is ATP that I mentioned at the beginning.

45:01.020 --> 45:04.820
These days, it's made by this astonishing rotating motor,

45:04.820 --> 45:09.220
the ATP synthase, which is the membrane here.

45:09.220 --> 45:13.220
It's got this literally rotating motor and it's making ATP.

45:13.220 --> 45:17.860
It's one of the most magical molecular machines.

45:17.860 --> 45:19.620
It's just beautiful.

45:19.620 --> 45:20.460
And it's rotating.

45:20.460 --> 45:23.700
This is not really rotating slowly like that.

45:23.700 --> 45:27.620
It's going 200 times revolutions a second,

45:27.620 --> 45:29.380
up to 500 revolutions a second.

45:29.380 --> 45:32.020
It's extraordinary fast.

45:32.020 --> 45:35.220
And it's just phosphorylating ATP to ATP.

45:35.220 --> 45:38.700
So it's adding a phosphate group on to ADP.

45:38.700 --> 45:41.140
And it's been a big question,

45:41.140 --> 45:43.420
how do we make ATP then in the absence

45:43.420 --> 45:44.900
of a sophisticated protein like that?

45:44.900 --> 45:46.300
There are ways of doing it.

45:46.300 --> 45:48.420
But here's, this is just showing again,

45:48.420 --> 45:53.540
with peric iron and water and two-carbon acetyl phosphate,

45:53.540 --> 45:57.180
we get about 15% to 20% yield of ATP.

45:57.180 --> 46:00.860
It varies depending on the temperature.

46:00.860 --> 46:03.860
Most metal ions didn't work, only peric iron worked.

46:03.860 --> 46:07.140
And we could do it with ATP, but not with the other bases.

46:07.140 --> 46:09.980
So why is it the universal energy currency in part

46:09.980 --> 46:13.580
because you can make it in water with peric iron as a catalyst

46:13.580 --> 46:17.220
and acetyl phosphate as a phosphate donor?

46:17.220 --> 46:18.580
So it's prebiotic chemistry.

46:18.580 --> 46:21.580
It works and you get specifically ATP.

46:21.580 --> 46:24.020
We're not synthesizing ATP all the steps.

46:24.020 --> 46:25.900
This is just the last bit of phosphorylating,

46:25.900 --> 46:28.420
but it's interesting that it works.

46:28.420 --> 46:31.020
Okay, information.

46:31.020 --> 46:32.780
And keep an eye on the time.

46:32.780 --> 46:33.740
I'm going a little slow.

46:33.740 --> 46:35.180
Are you all right?

46:35.180 --> 46:38.580
Should we have a music break?

46:38.580 --> 46:39.740
I'll keep going for now.

46:39.740 --> 46:42.940
So information.

46:42.940 --> 46:44.660
This is kind of what you've seen already.

46:44.660 --> 46:46.460
This is the pattern of metabolism.

46:46.460 --> 46:47.780
I'm talking about pyruvate.

46:47.780 --> 46:49.820
These are the Krebs cycle intermediates up here.

46:49.820 --> 46:50.820
And it's color coded.

46:50.820 --> 46:52.700
These are all amino acids.

46:52.780 --> 46:58.980
And in gray, they all have a G at the first position of the codon.

46:58.980 --> 47:06.180
So in DNA and RNA, each amino acid is encoded by three letters.

47:06.180 --> 47:07.460
It's called a codon.

47:07.460 --> 47:13.220
And those three letters in the first one for glycine

47:13.220 --> 47:16.100
is always a G and so on.

47:16.100 --> 47:20.780
This is when the first letter is an A for adenosine.

47:20.780 --> 47:23.700
In blue, it's encoded by cytidine.

47:23.700 --> 47:27.980
And in green, it's by a U.

47:27.980 --> 47:29.580
And you can see immediately looking at that,

47:29.580 --> 47:32.020
that there's some interesting structure there.

47:32.020 --> 47:37.020
That it looks as if the G is very close to CO2 fixation

47:37.020 --> 47:40.580
and the blue ones are much further away.

47:40.580 --> 47:41.820
And that is indeed the case.

47:41.820 --> 47:43.340
We see a kind of correlation.

47:43.340 --> 47:48.580
It's a reasonable correlation, not perfect, but this is the number of steps

47:48.580 --> 47:50.700
from CO2 to the amino acid.

47:50.700 --> 47:53.620
And it's the shorter distance from G to U.

47:53.620 --> 47:57.380
The outlier down here is cysteine, which is that one,

47:57.380 --> 48:04.180
which we have reasons why we can explain why that's an outlier, we think.

48:04.180 --> 48:07.020
That's the first position of the codon.

48:07.020 --> 48:09.700
If we organize this by the first position of the codon,

48:09.700 --> 48:13.780
so a G or an A at that first position or a C or a U,

48:13.780 --> 48:17.300
this is the second position of the anticodon.

48:17.620 --> 48:20.820
And this is the hydrophobicity.

48:20.820 --> 48:26.580
And so the V is valine, it's a very hydrophobic amino acid.

48:26.580 --> 48:30.940
And it's encoded, the colors changed here, unfortunately, this is now an A.

48:30.940 --> 48:36.340
So valine is encoded at the second position of the anticodon by an A,

48:36.340 --> 48:39.260
which is the most hydrophobic base.

48:39.260 --> 48:42.380
So we have effectively the most hydrophobic base encodes,

48:42.380 --> 48:44.380
the most hydrophobic amino acid.

48:44.460 --> 48:47.380
And here we have a spartate, and it's encoded by a U,

48:47.380 --> 48:52.100
which is the most hydrophilic amino acid encoded by the most hydrophilic base.

48:52.100 --> 48:57.980
So we see this relationship between how much water-loving or water-hating they are.

48:57.980 --> 49:01.300
It suggests they're snuggling up to each other in some way.

49:02.460 --> 49:06.660
It's less strong if we're further away, if we're looking at C and U,

49:06.660 --> 49:10.380
so these were the ones that were further away at the first position.

49:10.380 --> 49:12.620
There is a relationship, but it's not very impressive.

49:12.620 --> 49:16.380
But these first two, it really does look as if there are direct interactions

49:16.380 --> 49:19.660
between amino acids and the bases that code for them.

49:19.660 --> 49:25.220
And this is a third position, and this is what's called an inverted codon table.

49:25.220 --> 49:28.700
So first of all, most people would think that the third position

49:28.700 --> 49:30.940
is usually just thought of as redundant.

49:30.940 --> 49:34.540
There's not much information in that third position.

49:34.540 --> 49:37.260
So where it's white, it is redundant.

49:37.260 --> 49:40.940
There can be more than one amino acid encoded there.

49:40.980 --> 49:44.860
But where it's coloured, these are not redundant.

49:44.860 --> 49:47.980
It's a single amino acid is encoded by that.

49:47.980 --> 49:51.460
So you can see immediately that it's not a random patterning.

49:51.460 --> 49:55.380
The redundancy itself is not random in the genetic code.

49:55.380 --> 49:58.580
And if I just consider one example, so this is glutamate,

49:58.580 --> 50:02.300
and it's the same colour as a spartate over here,

50:02.300 --> 50:05.180
they've both got a G at the first position of the codon,

50:05.180 --> 50:08.220
they've both got an A at the second position of the codon,

50:08.220 --> 50:12.940
but this glutamate has a purine, and a spartate has a pyrimidine.

50:12.940 --> 50:15.100
Now, pyrimidines have got two rings, they're bigger.

50:15.100 --> 50:17.620
Pyrimidines have got a single ring, they're smaller.

50:17.620 --> 50:20.300
And it corresponds to the size of the amino acid.

50:20.300 --> 50:26.100
So we can predict most of the code on the basis of these interactions.

50:26.100 --> 50:28.820
It's kind of circular, we're predicting the code from patterns

50:28.820 --> 50:32.780
that are inside the code anyway, so there's some problem here.

50:32.780 --> 50:34.620
But we can also test these things,

50:34.620 --> 50:40.140
and we've done molecular dynamic simulations and NMR.

50:40.140 --> 50:42.060
And I'll just give one example here.

50:42.060 --> 50:44.540
So this is the amino acid proline,

50:44.540 --> 50:46.700
and we're looking to see how much time does it spend

50:46.700 --> 50:50.900
close to each of these bases A, C, G or U,

50:50.900 --> 50:54.140
and within about two angstroms, so really snuggling up,

50:54.140 --> 50:56.580
it's spending a lot of time with a G,

50:56.580 --> 50:59.700
and it's not spending so much time with the other bases.

50:59.700 --> 51:03.980
G is the one that encodes it at the second position of the anticodon.

51:04.060 --> 51:06.340
For arginine, we also get it correct,

51:06.340 --> 51:09.780
but there's a lot of overlap here, so it's kind of weak and statistical,

51:09.780 --> 51:16.180
but we can predict about 50% of the code on these interactions.

51:16.180 --> 51:22.100
And it's interesting, this is the one, so here, for example,

51:22.100 --> 51:28.980
with proline, we think that it should be with a G, and that's here.

51:28.980 --> 51:33.820
So we think G first, and then so this is the second guess,

51:33.820 --> 51:36.100
this is the third one, and this is the worst one.

51:36.100 --> 51:39.220
And I've put a ring around the correct base,

51:39.220 --> 51:41.900
and they're organised according to a hydrophobicity.

51:41.900 --> 51:44.700
So these things are very hydrophobic, these things are very hydrophilic,

51:44.700 --> 51:48.700
and we get 50% correct, but they're all the hydrophilic end.

51:48.700 --> 51:51.940
At the hydrophobic end, we don't do very well.

51:51.940 --> 51:55.900
So this molecular dynamic simulations,

51:55.900 --> 51:58.700
I'm not really a proper chemist,

51:58.700 --> 52:01.420
it's all about the forces between atoms,

52:01.420 --> 52:05.100
and how strong are hydrophobic interactions,

52:05.100 --> 52:06.780
or how strong is charge interactions,

52:06.780 --> 52:09.180
over what distance does it operate, and so on.

52:09.180 --> 52:11.020
And they're a little bit clunky,

52:11.020 --> 52:14.900
and they don't seem to be very good at these hydrophobic ones.

52:14.900 --> 52:16.460
We did that with two different programmes,

52:16.460 --> 52:18.100
and we got the same results, more or less.

52:18.100 --> 52:20.540
And we got the same thing with NMR as well.

52:20.540 --> 52:22.900
NMR also has a problem with hydrophobicity,

52:22.900 --> 52:25.740
because you can't dissolve hydrophobic amino acids in water

52:25.740 --> 52:27.580
at a high concentration, or the bases,

52:27.580 --> 52:29.540
and so you don't have a good signal.

52:29.540 --> 52:30.860
So it's very messy.

52:30.860 --> 52:33.180
It's funny, this is chemistry that people have been doing

52:33.180 --> 52:36.060
over decades, and it's still messy.

52:36.060 --> 52:38.900
But there is a pattern,

52:38.900 --> 52:40.980
and it seems to be supported by the data,

52:40.980 --> 52:44.500
and that can explain the origins of information in biology.

52:44.500 --> 52:47.060
This is a summary slide of everything I've said, really.

52:47.060 --> 52:49.380
We've got a proton gradient across a membrane,

52:49.380 --> 52:51.780
driving the reaction between hydrogen and CO2,

52:51.780 --> 52:55.180
going into a proto metabolism, making amino acids,

52:55.180 --> 52:56.660
and nucleotides.

52:56.660 --> 52:59.420
We're polymerising the nucleotides to make RNA,

52:59.420 --> 53:03.620
polymerising the amino acids to make peptides.

53:03.620 --> 53:06.380
We have stereochemical interactions between them.

53:06.380 --> 53:09.180
We've got something like translation going on here,

53:09.180 --> 53:10.300
making these things,

53:10.300 --> 53:13.180
and we have all kinds of positive feedback loops

53:13.180 --> 53:14.740
interacting there,

53:14.740 --> 53:17.100
which can make this system increase.

53:17.100 --> 53:18.620
I'm not going to go through the details of this,

53:18.620 --> 53:20.460
but we can imagine very simple ways

53:20.460 --> 53:22.180
in which these amino acids can interact

53:22.180 --> 53:26.020
with very small aptomers of RNA.

53:26.020 --> 53:28.300
Right, for the last 10 minutes,

53:28.380 --> 53:34.060
I'm just going to touch on consciousness in bacteria,

53:34.060 --> 53:35.380
not in us.

53:35.380 --> 53:38.700
When I say consciousness, let me confess,

53:38.700 --> 53:40.540
probably what I'm going to talk about

53:40.540 --> 53:43.540
is not what you would understand by consciousness.

53:43.540 --> 53:47.020
But the question for me is a biochemist for a long time,

53:47.020 --> 53:48.380
and I've never understood it,

53:48.380 --> 53:52.380
is what are feelings in biochemical terms?

53:52.380 --> 53:55.140
What we seem to care most about, I think, as humans,

53:55.140 --> 53:58.860
and what we're scared about with AI and so on,

53:58.860 --> 54:02.820
is will it become scarily human?

54:02.820 --> 54:04.420
Will it become conscious?

54:04.420 --> 54:06.020
Will it start being sentient,

54:06.020 --> 54:08.300
have feelings, all of these kind of things?

54:08.300 --> 54:12.220
A lot of people in the AI world are very interested now

54:12.220 --> 54:15.460
in what does biology have to say about consciousness,

54:15.460 --> 54:18.540
and the answer is, well, not very much.

54:18.540 --> 54:21.660
It's been known as the hard problem for quite a long time,

54:21.660 --> 54:23.220
and the hard problem, more or less,

54:23.220 --> 54:26.380
is why is it that a feeling of pain,

54:26.380 --> 54:28.700
or of hunger, or thirst, or whatever it may be,

54:28.700 --> 54:31.380
what actually is that in terms of biochemistry?

54:31.380 --> 54:32.980
If a neuron depolarises,

54:32.980 --> 54:37.300
why does it give rise to a feeling of anything at all?

54:37.300 --> 54:41.180
Now, in my view, it evolved,

54:41.180 --> 54:46.300
but if it evolved, then natural selection acted on something,

54:46.300 --> 54:49.340
and the question is, well, how far back does that go?

54:49.340 --> 54:51.340
You can anesthetise all kinds of things,

54:51.420 --> 54:53.580
you can anesthetise anomeba,

54:53.580 --> 54:55.740
you can anesthetise bacteria.

54:55.740 --> 54:58.420
So whatever it is that anesthetics are doing to consciousness

54:58.420 --> 55:00.620
is not only at the level of a central nervous system,

55:00.620 --> 55:03.340
it's also at the level of single-celled critters.

55:03.340 --> 55:05.940
So what's happening?

55:05.940 --> 55:08.180
What I've been saying about how bacteria,

55:08.180 --> 55:11.180
how life started, this structure of cells,

55:11.180 --> 55:13.940
and the three parts I've been talking about,

55:13.940 --> 55:16.380
and especially the electric membranes,

55:16.380 --> 55:21.980
what I'm going to put to you is that the electromagnetic fields,

55:21.980 --> 55:24.900
electrostatic electromagnetic fields on these membranes

55:24.900 --> 55:28.460
give a real-time integrated feedback to a bacterial cell

55:28.460 --> 55:30.540
about how they're doing in the world,

55:30.540 --> 55:33.500
and I'll explain that to you and then why that may lead

55:33.500 --> 55:38.380
to the basis for amplifying everything as consciousness.

55:38.380 --> 55:41.500
So a real-time integrated feedback on your state in the world,

55:41.500 --> 55:44.140
I would say that's how it feels to be right now,

55:44.140 --> 55:46.100
and for a bacterial cell that means,

55:46.100 --> 55:48.540
am I good or am I bad, really not much more than that.

55:48.540 --> 55:53.060
It's a kind of little bit of a binary system.

55:53.060 --> 55:56.340
So imagine, here's a bacterial cell,

55:56.340 --> 56:00.300
we've got the outside world and stuff happens in the outside world,

56:00.300 --> 56:02.860
and it needs to detect whatever's going on out there

56:02.860 --> 56:05.380
and do something.

56:05.380 --> 56:07.980
It's a living cell.

56:07.980 --> 56:10.180
It's inside all this God, it's the metabolism,

56:10.180 --> 56:11.660
all this stuff I've been talking about,

56:11.660 --> 56:14.100
all of these billions of reactions every second

56:14.100 --> 56:16.740
that's going on inside, there's nothing else in there.

56:16.740 --> 56:18.380
It's just chemistry.

56:18.380 --> 56:20.940
It's got genes in there, but genes are slow as well,

56:20.940 --> 56:23.260
so it's interesting.

56:23.260 --> 56:25.860
We've got literally one billion reactions a second

56:25.860 --> 56:29.580
going on inside here, and somehow they're going to determine

56:29.580 --> 56:33.220
what that cell decides it's going to do.

56:33.220 --> 56:37.180
So what I've been telling you about is this Krebs cycle,

56:37.180 --> 56:38.980
and I'm keeping with the oxidative one here,

56:38.980 --> 56:40.660
we're stripping out hydrogen CO2,

56:40.660 --> 56:42.300
we've got food coming in,

56:42.300 --> 56:44.580
and we're pumping protons across that membrane

56:44.580 --> 56:48.580
to generate an electrical charge on the membrane.

56:48.580 --> 56:51.140
So this is what I've been setting up all along.

56:51.140 --> 56:53.700
But we don't have just one Krebs cycle in there,

56:53.700 --> 56:55.420
we actually have scores of them,

56:55.420 --> 56:58.980
probably thousands of them all spinning at the same time,

56:58.980 --> 57:02.260
potentially at different rates.

57:02.260 --> 57:04.460
There's all kinds of things that could be going on.

57:04.460 --> 57:09.700
So what is synchronising that cell at the same rate?

57:09.700 --> 57:11.940
To a larger extent, it's the charge on the membrane,

57:11.940 --> 57:13.700
because all of them are plugged into the membrane,

57:13.700 --> 57:15.260
and for them to spin,

57:15.260 --> 57:18.100
they've got to push against the same force.

57:18.100 --> 57:21.620
And also that force is powering ATP synthesis,

57:21.620 --> 57:23.500
and for a lot of chemistry to happen in the cell,

57:23.500 --> 57:28.020
you need ATP, and it needs to be far from equilibrium,

57:28.020 --> 57:31.820
which is to say you need that ratio of ATP to ADP

57:31.820 --> 57:33.340
to be a similar distance away.

57:33.340 --> 57:36.060
So this charge on the membrane

57:36.060 --> 57:39.060
is going to be forcing all of the biochemistry of the cell

57:39.060 --> 57:41.180
into effectively the same state,

57:41.180 --> 57:43.220
the same rate of operating,

57:43.220 --> 57:45.140
and you can gauge what that is

57:45.140 --> 57:48.340
from the strength of the charge on the membrane.

57:48.340 --> 57:52.660
And also, because this is moving charge,

57:52.660 --> 57:55.620
it will be generating electromagnetic fields as well.

57:55.620 --> 57:57.540
I suspect, but cannot prove to you

57:57.540 --> 57:59.380
that there's a balance between electromagnetic

57:59.380 --> 58:01.420
and electrostatic fields that they can pick up on,

58:01.420 --> 58:03.980
which gives them an idea of how they're doing

58:03.980 --> 58:05.900
in relation to the environment.

58:05.900 --> 58:08.740
So it needs to make a kind of a binary decision.

58:08.740 --> 58:11.260
Let's imagine it's too hot,

58:11.260 --> 58:12.540
or maybe there's toxins there.

58:12.540 --> 58:13.500
What are you going to do?

58:13.500 --> 58:15.460
Are you going to stay, or are you going to go?

58:15.460 --> 58:19.020
Are you going to paddle with your flagellum and move across?

58:19.020 --> 58:21.260
It's a two-bit decision.

58:21.260 --> 58:24.220
Ready? Either you stay or you go.

58:24.220 --> 58:25.060
One bit.

58:25.060 --> 58:29.060
So you need to integrate all this information

58:29.060 --> 58:30.020
on your state in the world.

58:30.020 --> 58:33.220
Now, it could be that it's too hot.

58:33.220 --> 58:34.060
What am I going to do?

58:34.060 --> 58:35.580
My proteins are beginning to unravel,

58:35.580 --> 58:37.140
they're beginning to come undone.

58:37.220 --> 58:39.260
I'm going to set off some genes.

58:39.260 --> 58:41.740
I'm going to activate some genes and a stress response,

58:41.740 --> 58:43.300
which is going to fix my proteins.

58:43.300 --> 58:45.420
But it's going to take half an hour

58:45.420 --> 58:47.060
before these things are ready.

58:47.060 --> 58:49.540
And the proteins, I need to refold them.

58:49.540 --> 58:51.980
That's going to take minutes.

58:51.980 --> 58:52.980
I can activate very...

58:52.980 --> 58:54.780
But how do I know what I just did?

58:55.660 --> 58:59.220
I need to have some idea now

58:59.220 --> 59:01.980
about what my predicament is in the outside world.

59:01.980 --> 59:03.260
I need to know it's too hot.

59:03.260 --> 59:04.580
There has to be some information

59:04.660 --> 59:07.420
that this system is giving me about my predicament.

59:07.420 --> 59:11.460
I don't know yet because I just set off a gene response,

59:11.460 --> 59:12.620
which is doing something,

59:12.620 --> 59:14.140
but I don't know which genes I triggered

59:14.140 --> 59:15.340
and I don't know what the problem is.

59:15.340 --> 59:18.260
So this is where a feeling is beginning to come in.

59:18.260 --> 59:20.460
It's effectively, I think it's too hot.

59:20.460 --> 59:22.700
I should move over there

59:22.700 --> 59:25.380
in terms of the fields on the membrane,

59:25.380 --> 59:27.460
which is telling you the states that you're in.

59:27.460 --> 59:30.220
It's integrating all this information on the membrane.

59:30.220 --> 59:31.860
So that's what I'm proposing.

59:32.860 --> 59:35.940
It's not completely hand-waving.

59:35.940 --> 59:37.460
I mean, this, I admit, immediately

59:37.460 --> 59:39.140
is the more hand-wavy bit of the talk.

59:39.140 --> 59:42.700
I think the origin of life stuff is becoming science.

59:42.700 --> 59:45.220
This is still philosophy, perhaps more than science,

59:45.220 --> 59:47.060
but it's an interesting starting point.

59:47.060 --> 59:48.260
But there is also some data.

59:48.260 --> 59:50.620
So, for example, these are phages,

59:50.620 --> 59:54.060
bacteria phages attacking a bacterium.

59:54.060 --> 59:55.740
And it's quite interesting what happens

59:55.740 --> 59:58.900
because lots of bacteria will kill themselves,

59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.500
especially if they're part of a larger colony,

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:02.900
a biofilm, for example,

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:07.740
or some kind of ocean bloom of bacteria.

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:08.580
Why would they do that?

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:10.460
Why would a single cell kill itself?

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:12.500
Well, the answer, it's standard biology.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:13.980
It's what's called kin selection.

01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:17.020
And effectively, if you kill yourself,

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:18.660
you also prevent the viruses

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.380
from making copies of themselves.

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.020
Then they can't infect the next cell.

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:25.740
And so your genes and so on will do better in your relatives.

01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:28.620
You don't even have to be very closely related to the next cell.

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:30.860
Still, you'll be somewhat related

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.180
and your genes will do better if you kill yourself.

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:35.460
So how do you, if you're in this predicament

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:37.100
of being taken down by viruses,

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.700
how do you kill yourself?

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.700
The answer is you unplug the membrane.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.500
You collapse the membrane potential.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:43.620
That's what you do.

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:45.660
That will kill you in seconds.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.700
So this is really bacterial death.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:50.700
It's all about the membrane potential,

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.220
which makes me think,

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:55.140
when they paddle, I showed you them paddling around,

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:57.300
this is proton powered.

01:00:57.300 --> 01:01:01.620
Again, all the behaviour that bacteria do,

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:04.140
all the import and export of things across that membrane

01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:07.500
is all powered by that membrane potential.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:10.100
So this is very much the life and death

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:13.100
of what bacterial cells are actually doing.

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:16.060
Now, this I think is the final slide.

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:22.460
We are made of more complex cells.

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:24.860
We're made of eukaryotic cells.

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:26.340
Eukaryotes have lots of mitochondria.

01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:27.940
These are the same things I've been showing you.

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:30.780
These are all individual bacteria that became included

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:32.220
in a much larger cell,

01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.980
or it became a larger cell in the end.

01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:37.460
And they're all doing the same kind of thing,

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.940
but now they've got to speak to each other.

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:40.340
There's different ways they can do that.

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:41.940
They can fuse together and fission.

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:43.540
There's all kinds of things they do,

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:47.700
but somehow they're all together responsible for metabolism.

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:50.060
And in a strange way, because when we breathe oxygen,

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:51.540
it's going straight here.

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:54.380
And when we're digesting food and burning food,

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.700
it's going straight here.

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:58.980
So although this is the interface with the world,

01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:01.020
really what's happening is going on here.

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:03.500
Any problems that we have in relation to the world,

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:06.660
we feel them foremost in our mitochondria.

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:08.780
And we need to integrate this information

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:11.300
across maybe hundreds or thousands of mitochondria.

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:13.940
And again, I'm thinking that fields are one way

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:15.540
in which this can happen.

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:18.300
And then this is a single cell like an amoeba cell.

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.220
Then we have multicellular organisms,

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.060
and now we've got cells to bring together

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:23.580
all with these moving parts inside.

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:25.780
And finally, a central nervous system,

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:27.500
which amplifies all of this.

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:30.380
So the communications, the electrical communications

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:33.140
between single cells and their interface with the world,

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.100
becoming incorporated into larger cells,

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.780
incorporated into multicellular organisms,

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.420
and finally into a central nervous system.

01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:41.820
This, I'm suggesting, is the substrate,

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:45.180
which gives rise in the end to the complexity

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:46.740
of our own consciousness.

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:49.820
This is what I've said.

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:51.060
Perhaps I don't need to say it again.

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:52.380
I feel like I'm running out of time.

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.060
So what I'm going to say instead is thank you

01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.580
to the guys in my lab who've been working on this.

01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:59.740
It's pretty brave for them to do it at all.

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:01.660
This is, in fact, an old slide.

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:03.940
They're holding the Krebs cycle, and I like that so much.

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:06.860
It was a birthday present a few years ago that I've kept it.

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:08.420
So half these guys have now left my lab,

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:10.340
and I've had to put the ones who've joined

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:12.100
since then around the outside.

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.860
I suppose I'll have to change this at some point,

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:19.020
but it's a brave thing to do a PhD on the origin of life.

01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:21.540
And I'm beginning to start thinking about doing experiments

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:23.740
on consciousness, which is probably even more foolhardy

01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.220
for them to join me.

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:27.260
So I want to thank them especially.

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.460
Thanks to the funders, and thank you very much

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:30.980
for the invitation and for listening,

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:32.900
and I'm very happy to take questions.
