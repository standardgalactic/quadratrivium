19
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,820
I don't know if this is going to challenge the ethics, but I hope that it might lead to something of a debate towards the end.

20
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:34,700
OK. First thing to say is, we will never know how life started on Earth.

21
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:41,660
Even if we invented a time machine and we were able to go back four billion years to the origin of life,

22
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:47,060
we could not agree among ourselves as scientists in this field, where should we go?

23
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,260
Should we go into the atmosphere? Should we find a beach?

24
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,340
These are stromatolites that you can see. It's actually living rocks, you may say.

25
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,620
Should we go down into the depths of the ocean?

26
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:05,300
Scientists who work in the field cannot agree with each other about things as simple, you may say, as that.

27
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:13,740
And if we actually did succeed in agreeing on where to go and we go there and we find some green slime on a rock,

28
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:22,340
do we know if this is a step en route to the origin of life, or is this some side alley going nowhere in particular?

29
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,740
Again, we have no way of knowing.

30
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,100
So even if we had a time machine, we still wouldn't be able to answer the question.

31
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,660
So you may think it's completely hopeless. Why am I even standing here?

32
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,180
Well, we can. We can hope to understand it.

33
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,620
That's really what we're trying to do.

34
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,860
I don't think there's any likelihood that over the next, say, five to ten years, as some people claim,

35
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,740
that we will succeed in producing life in the lab and we'll have cells growing out of some test tube or something.

36
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,740
I think we are miles and miles away from doing that.

37
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,900
But we can try to understand the kinds of environments, the kind of chemistry going on and all the steps.

38
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:07,860
We can work out an intellectual framework that will explain how a wet rocky planet with no life on it whatsoever

39
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,420
can give rise to the kind of glorious planet that we live on.

40
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,540
How can we even think about that transition?

41
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,060
I think we can.

42
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,460
What I'd like to try and get across to you this evening is that we're beginning to have some ideas.

43
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,380
At least some people agree with them. Some people don't.

44
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,300
But I want to try and persuade you that it's not just hand waving.

45
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,700
So how do we begin to think about it?

46
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,460
I would say for the last 50, 60 years or so, the guide to the origin of life has really been chemistry.

47
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,060
What chemistry actually works and which chemistry doesn't work so well.

48
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,940
Over the last perhaps 15, 20 years, biology has become involved for the first time.

49
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,980
Until then, surprisingly, biologists had almost nothing to say on the origin of life.

50
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,620
It was dismissed as armchair speculation of the worst kind, not science at all.

51
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,900
Whereas the chemists were thinking, OK, here's an interesting challenge in synthetic chemistry.

52
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,020
Can we make the nucleotides that make up DNA or RNA? Can we make the sugars?

53
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,380
Can we make the lipids to make membranes and so on?

54
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,940
It was a valid question in synthetic chemistry and they've made all of these things.

55
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,420
Then you have a little problem about, OK, you put them all together in a pot and then what happens?

56
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,820
It doesn't just kind of congeal into cells and start crawling out.

57
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,900
So there's something missing still.

58
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,420
Biology, life itself, is an interesting guide and what I'm going to try and suggest to you is that

59
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,500
it's in fact an excellent guide in three different areas.

60
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,780
Energy, metabolism, which is one of those words that tend to put a lot of people off,

61
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,300
but I'll try and explain this as likely as I can.

62
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,900
And then genetic information, genes.

63
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,380
Where does information in biology come from?

64
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,220
Which I think a lot of people find more interesting than metabolism.

65
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,380
On the other hand, it can become quite obscure quite quickly.

66
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,940
When you see the two together, it makes much more sense.

67
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,780
So before I get going, I'm going to orientate you to those three themes.

68
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,260
This is, you could think of this as a bacterial cell.

69
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,180
You could think of this as the mitochondria inside your own cells.

70
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,700
The mitochondria are the power packs inside your cells.

71
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,300
And this is what's happening inside you right now.

72
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,020
Keep this as simple as I can. We're burning glucose.

73
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,540
We're breaking it down to an intermediate.

74
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,540
You don't even don't need to know the name of it, Acetyl CoA.

75
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,100
And we go through this thing called the Krebs cycle.

76
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:35,980
And the Krebs cycle is basically pulling out CO2 and hydrogen.

77
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,100
That's all I really want you to get from this.

78
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,980
CO2 is a way of breathing it out into the atmosphere,

79
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,500
contributing our own little bit to global warming.

80
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,820
And the hydrogen, while we're splitting the hydrogen,

81
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,620
the hydrogen atoms, two hydrogen atoms,

82
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,420
we're splitting them into their fundamental parts,

83
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,260
the electrons and the protons.

84
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,940
We have a current of electrons going to oxygen.

85
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,020
That current of electrons,

86
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,900
literally pretty much an electric wire inside this membrane,

87
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,260
inside this insulated membrane,

88
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,460
is powering the extrusion of protons across the membrane.

89
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,740
So now we have a lot of protons on this side of the membrane,

90
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,140
very few protons on the inside.

91
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,900
About three orders of magnitude difference,

92
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,780
three pH units difference.

93
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,740
Now that may not seem like very much.

94
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:29,220
It's about an electrical charge of about 150 to 200 millivolts.

95
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,380
But if you were to shrink yourself down to the size of a molecule

96
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,340
and stand right next to this membrane there,

97
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,380
you would experience an electrical field strength

98
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,940
of about 30 million volts per metre.

99
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,260
That's equivalent to a bolt of lightning.

100
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,780
So this entire surface area of membrane

101
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,260
has got an electrical charge equivalent to a bolt of lightning

102
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,260
going across it.

103
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,060
It's just such a small distance, five nanometres,

104
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,300
that the actual charge is quite small.

105
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,980
But it's quite a field strength.

106
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,060
That is powering everything.

107
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,180
I'm showing here a protein called the ATP synthase.

108
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,580
I'll come back to that later on.

109
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,260
ATP is often called the universal energy currency.

110
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,340
In other words, it's powering work.

111
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,020
But that work doesn't have to be making this ATP,

112
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,060
this energy currency, any kind of work.

113
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,820
It can power the bacterial flagella,

114
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,620
which will kind of row a bacterium around the place.

115
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,140
It can power CO2 fixation,

116
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,340
which is what I'll say more about.

117
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,020
OK, so that's how energy works in biology.

118
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,980
That's basically it for all cells.

119
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,980
It's kind of...

120
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,300
There are plenty of variations on that thing,

121
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,780
but this is fundamental.

122
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,860
All life works that way.

123
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,940
It's amazing.

124
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,140
Your own cells work that way,

125
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,260
bacteria work that way,

126
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,380
stuff that you find high up in the atmosphere

127
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,820
on the outside of the space station

128
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,020
or deep down in the bowels of the earth,

129
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,460
in the deep hot biosphere.

130
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,060
It's all working that way.

131
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,220
It's amazing.

132
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,220
It's as universally conserved as the genetic code itself.

133
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,260
OK, this looks exactly the same.

134
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,940
It's not. It's the opposite.

135
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,500
What I'm showing here is this Krebs cycle

136
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,420
going in the opposite direction.

137
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,940
I've still got hydrogen and CO2.

138
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,860
Think what happens though.

139
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,140
Normally when the Krebs cycle is spinning,

140
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,060
it's pulling out hydrogen and CO2

141
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,140
and it's burning the hydrogen in oxygen.

142
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,300
The reverse Krebs cycle,

143
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,380
and quite a lot of bacteria work this way,

144
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,940
is sucking in hydrogen and CO2

145
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,740
and using the energy of this charged membrane

146
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,660
to make them react together to form organic molecules.

147
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,940
The Krebs cycle intermediates.

148
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,900
They're carboxylic acids.

149
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,340
And from then, we make amino acids and sugars

150
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,060
and nucleotide the building blocks of DNA and RNA

151
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:40,460
and lipids for the membranes themselves and so on.

152
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,260
So it's not about energy only.

153
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,100
It's also about biosynthesis.

154
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,020
It's about making the building blocks of life.

155
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,060
And this is again really deeply conserved in biology.

156
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,860
Some of the molecules in that Krebs cycle,

157
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,940
not necessarily always as a complete cycle,

158
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,620
sometimes more as a linear pathway,

159
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,780
but there are five molecules in there

160
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,860
which are universally conserved across all of life.

161
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,060
They are the universal precursors for all of metabolism.

162
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,380
This is the starting point for making everything that cells do.

163
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,140
And it's all coming from here.

164
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,300
And it's powered by the same system.

165
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,740
It's just operating in reverse.

166
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,900
So it's kind of strange that both metabolism and energy

167
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,380
are powered by the same system.

168
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,260
There's a tension between which way is it going to go.

169
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,340
And in our own bodies, sometimes it's going both ways.

170
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,940
And cancer very often is working with the Krebs cycle

171
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,660
going in the opposite direction, in this reverse direction,

172
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,740
making the building blocks to make new cells

173
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,260
to power the growth of cancer cells.

174
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,060
So that's in a nutshell how metabolism is working.

175
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,660
And genetic information,

176
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,140
I'm going to come back to this in a little more detail later on,

177
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,100
but just what I want you to take now

178
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,060
is that there are patterns in the genetic code

179
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,460
and these have been known about for 60 years

180
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,140
since the early 1960s,

181
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,940
which suggests that there are direct interactions

182
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,820
between the codons,

183
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,620
which is to say that the units within DNA or RNA

184
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,140
that codes for an amino acid in the protein

185
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,260
and the amino acid itself.

186
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,700
In other words, there's a kind of stickiness, you may say.

187
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,060
There are interactions between that particular letter

188
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,660
and that particular amino acid.

189
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,300
And what that suggests is that the genetic code

190
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,100
is not just some random arbitrary assortment,

191
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,740
but that if you had a random string of RNA,

192
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,940
a random string of letters,

193
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:37,180
then you would have a non-random string of amino acids

194
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,020
that in one way or another, and it may be more like this,

195
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,180
we don't need to specify exactly how that works.

196
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,740
The patterns are there anyway.

197
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,380
What it suggests is that there are direct interactions

198
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,300
between the amino acids and the bases in the genetic code

199
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,820
that code for them.

200
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,620
And so a random RNA sequence codes and non-random peptide,

201
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,220
if that peptide has function in whatever environment it may be,

202
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,180
then natural selection, as we know it, can start.

203
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,900
And there's no mystery about the origin

204
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,620
of information in biology.

205
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,100
So one thing to say about that immediately.

206
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,340
What I'm suggesting here is that we have electricity

207
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,260
driving metabolism, which is giving rise to genes,

208
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,500
and that means it's all going to happen in one place,

209
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,340
and that's already a little bit unnerving

210
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,260
if you're thinking about the origin of life.

211
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,140
Most theories on the origin of life until now have said,

212
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,660
OK, well, this chemistry happens best over here,

213
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:34,260
and that chemistry works over there, and this works down here,

214
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,500
and we can bring them all together somehow,

215
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,340
and then they will, as I say, congeal into cells

216
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,900
and crawl out of the test tube.

217
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,860
They don't do that.

218
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,740
So what do they do?

219
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,860
Well, in some kind of a place where we've got a continuous reactivity,

220
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,780
continuous gases being brought together,

221
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,420
let's say hydrogen and CO2,

222
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,740
to react together to form these molecules,

223
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,420
forming genes in the same place.

224
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,140
It's a scary hypothesis, but at least it's testable,

225
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,900
and you could say it's very easily testable

226
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,340
because you can do it if you can get the right conditions.

227
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,340
You can do it on a lab bench.

228
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,740
If it's all happening in the same place,

229
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,060
then you can just go straight ahead and test it.

230
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,500
So what kind of place could it possibly be?

231
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,580
Well, the place I favour, it doesn't have to be here,

232
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,660
but this is something that we can get our head around.

233
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,940
I want to know, as alkaline hydrothermal vents.

234
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,620
They were discovered by Deb Kelly,

235
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,780
who was captain of the Alvin submersible back in the year 2000.

236
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,820
Before that, there had been other deep-sea hydrothermal vents

237
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,220
known back into the 1970s,

238
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,660
but these are quite different.

239
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,060
They're not smoking in the way that you'll mostly be familiar,

240
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,820
I'm sure, with the idea of black smokers

241
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,060
with chimney and smoke coming out of the top,

242
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,420
billowing out of the top.

243
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,220
They're not like that. They almost look dead.

244
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,220
They're not dead.

245
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,860
These are living vent systems with fluids going through them.

246
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,620
Deb Kelly here has got a lump of a black smoker

247
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,900
with this chimney structure,

248
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,980
and this is a bit of lost city,

249
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,020
and you might be able to see it looks a bit like a mineralised sponge.

250
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,620
It's kind of a labyrinth of interconnected pores.

251
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,140
And so there are alkaline fluids,

252
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,300
hydrothermal fluids kind of winding their way

253
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,420
through these interconnected pores.

254
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,660
Now, they're not produced by the same mechanism

255
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,860
that makes the black smoke events.

256
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,940
The black smokers are produced by effectively direct interaction

257
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,180
between magma, volcanic magma, and ocean water,

258
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,100
at the spreading centres of the mid-ocean ridges and so on.

259
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,180
What's happening here, we're away from this,

260
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,860
and water will effectively percolate down into the sea floor.

261
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,500
And if the sea floor is relatively close to the mantle,

262
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,740
and this tends to happen these days close to the ridges,

263
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,540
this is 15, 20 kilometres away from the mid-Atlantic ridge,

264
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,580
these green minerals here, it's called olivine.

265
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:09,340
It's actually the most common mineral in the Earth's mantle.

266
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,660
It's also extremely common in distella space.

267
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,780
It's called olivine just because it looks a bit like olives.

268
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,300
It's really that simple.

269
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,500
Water will percolate down as much as five or six kilometres

270
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,340
underneath the sea floor and react with this olivine,

271
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,900
and it's an exothermic reaction.

272
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,660
It's releasing heat, and it's releasing these alkaline fluids,

273
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,300
so they're warm and they're buoyant and they bubble back up,

274
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,340
and plenty of hydrogen gas.

275
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,860
And it's basically just the oxidation of water that's going on.

276
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,620
Sorry, the oxidation of iron, so ferrous iron is going to ferric iron,

277
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,300
and water is being converted into hydrogen.

278
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,180
These same kind of vents should form on any wet rocky planet,

279
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,220
and they happen on a global scale.

280
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,020
So if this is the mid-Atlantic ridge,

281
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,940
it would be somewhere around here,

282
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,660
we have these reactions going on in the crust,

283
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,900
and then now with tectonic spreading,

284
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,260
it's spreading across the ocean floor and then being subducted down.

285
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,420
In effect, what's happening is the water is reacting with the rock

286
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,140
and hydrating the rock,

287
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,940
and then this hydrated rock is being subducted,

288
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,820
and at the increasing temperatures and pressures,

289
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,020
water is being driven off again.

290
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,580
And that water in the mantle is melting the mantle

291
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,540
and causing convection currents in the mantle,

292
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,460
and that is driving volcanic activity on the planet,

293
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,740
on literally a planetary scale.

294
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,700
So it's then quite interesting that Mars, for example,

295
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,460
which is a fairly small planet,

296
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,660
there's plenty of evidence that it had oceans four billion years ago,

297
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,340
maybe three and a half billion years ago on Mars,

298
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,060
and they disappeared,

299
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,620
and there's various explanations for where they went,

300
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,940
but one interesting explanation is this same process

301
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,940
called serpentinisation,

302
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,260
whereby the minerals like olivine react with water,

303
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,820
get subducted down,

304
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,700
but on a smaller planet which is cooling faster,

305
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,980
the temperatures are cooler now because the core is cooling down,

306
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,540
less of that water is driven off,

307
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,140
and, effectively, Mars buried its oceans as rock,

308
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,540
as hydrated rock,

309
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,540
and that's one of the reasons why Mars, effectively,

310
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,380
seems to have died as a planet.

311
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,220
Maybe there's still life hanging on there,

312
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,500
who knows, we'll find out,

313
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,340
but it would be, to me, quite surprising if there was,

314
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,660
and certainly it's not had any real impact on the atmosphere.

315
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,020
Occasionally we see traces of methane,

316
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:40,500
methane could also be produced by this process of serpentinisation.

317
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,380
Incidentally, I didn't define serpentinisation,

318
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,260
it sounds a bit intimidating.

319
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,580
I say minerals like olivine are reacting with water

320
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,140
and effectively rusting,

321
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,860
and they're being converted into another mineral called serpentinite,

322
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,980
and that's the process of serpentinisation,

323
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,020
it's a metamorphosis.

324
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,820
Why is it called serpentinite?

325
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,420
Because it looks like a serpent's scales, again.

326
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,620
The geologists have got these intimidating terms

327
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,220
that just mean something very simple.

328
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,420
We have a rock that looks like olives converted into a rock

329
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,980
that looks like serpent's scales,

330
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,580
it's called serpentinisation,

331
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,060
and it happens throughout the universe.

332
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:21,380
This is Enceladus, which is one of the moons of Saturn,

333
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,300
and there are these plumes that were initially seen by Cassini

334
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,380
on its fly past of Saturn.

335
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,020
And these are alkaline, they're around about pH 9,

336
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,020
they're rich in hydrogen and methane,

337
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,500
and plenty of organic molecules in there.

338
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,340
So, the interpretation of this is,

339
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,860
beneath the frozen surface of Enceladus, there is a liquid ocean,

340
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,660
and beneath that liquid ocean,

341
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:51,620
there is a rocky, olivine-rich...

342
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,140
I don't know what you call it, really, not exactly a mantle,

343
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,500
I'm not sure, I'm not a geologist, what the term would be,

344
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,620
but anyway, olivine-rich rock underneath the ocean,

345
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,020
serpentinising giving rise to this alkaline ocean

346
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,660
and the pressure is producing these plumes through cracks in the ice.

347
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,500
This idea of planetary scale things going on,

348
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,420
this is not a very exact analogy,

349
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,100
but it's a very interesting analogy,

350
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,260
that the structure of a cell, the topological structure of a cell,

351
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,660
and the topological structure of a planet are very similar to each other.

352
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,940
So, if this is the Earth, for example,

353
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,940
the inside has a negative charge relative to the outside.

354
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,940
All of the iron, which is buried down in the core,

355
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,380
is effectively electron-rich,

356
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,460
whereas the atmosphere, the oceans and so on, are relatively electron-poor.

357
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,740
We have gases like carbon dioxide and so on,

358
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,220
it's relatively oxidised outside.

359
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:54,580
So, it's also relatively more acidic outside,

360
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,020
this is slightly more problematic,

361
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,500
but effectively, if you see these as hydrothermal vents

362
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,540
between the mantle and the ocean,

363
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,020
then we have alkaline fluids coming out,

364
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,740
going into a relatively acidic early ocean.

365
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,900
Now, a cell structure is basically the same,

366
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,540
it's negatively charged inside,

367
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:19,180
it's relatively reduced inside, plenty of electrons and protons on the outside.

368
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,900
So, at a slightly hand-wavy level,

369
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,860
there is an interesting topological equivalence between planets

370
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,620
like the Earth, wet rocky planets, and the structure of cells.

371
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,300
This was first noticed,

372
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,020
I don't know if it's first noticed,

373
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,780
but it was noticed and pointed out by a guy called Mike Russell,

374
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,420
30 years ago now,

375
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,620
and after the discovery of Lost City by Deb Kelly,

376
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,300
his ideas became quite well-known.

377
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,380
He predicted the existence of vents like Lost City

378
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,220
10 years before their discovery,

379
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,860
and his ideas throughout the 90s were pretty marginal in the field,

380
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,460
nobody was very interested in them,

381
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,300
and you can look back at conference proceedings

382
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,140
and see the discussions after people's talks,

383
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,020
and there would be Mike Russell jumping up and saying,

384
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,020
yeah, but what about alkaline hydrothermal vents,

385
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,140
and everybody would ignore him,

386
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,900
and it was quite interesting to see this dynamic

387
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:20,580
all written up in volumes of forgotten life sciences history.

388
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,420
Then after the discovery of Lost City,

389
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,100
he suddenly became much more famous,

390
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,420
this was a feature article by Nature in the year 2009,

391
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,180
and they photoshopped him up as Erasmus,

392
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,300
as the Renaissance man,

393
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,860
and they called him Naissance man,

394
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,260
Naissance has in the birth of life,

395
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,620
and this is his reactor,

396
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,460
he was at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,

397
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,500
and this is a little bit of Lost City behind him,

398
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,700
and essentially what he was arguing,

399
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,900
and what I still think to be the right way of seeing the question,

400
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,620
is that there are high concentrations of hydrogen

401
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,580
in these alkaline fluids,

402
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,380
bubbling up into the ocean,

403
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,980
and the oceans, the early oceans were CO2 rich,

404
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,820
it's very hard to constrain how much,

405
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,780
but probably as much as one bar of carbon dioxide in those early oceans,

406
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,500
they would have been mildly acidic, perhaps pH 5 or 6,

407
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,380
and that means this is the sponge-like,

408
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,140
mineralised sponge-like structure,

409
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,420
all of these interconnected micro pores.

410
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,780
Four billion years ago, before there was any oxygen,

411
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,740
this is now carbonate rocks,

412
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:28,820
but we would expect to see lots of iron and nickel

413
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,620
and transition metals in there as well,

414
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,660
because these dissolved in the oceans

415
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,540
before there was any oxygen around,

416
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,420
especially in acidic oceans.

417
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,740
So we would expect to see some of these walls

418
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,740
effectively containing catalytic transition metals and equivalents.

419
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,220
And so reactive fluids percolating,

420
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,700
wending their way through, ocean waters coming in,

421
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,380
this is really an electrochemical flow reactor,

422
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,140
where we've got the two components that I was saying earlier on,

423
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,460
make up the Krebs cycle,

424
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,220
are the first starting point for life hydrogen and CO2

425
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,460
being forcibly reacted together with natural proton gradients,

426
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,180
which is to say differences in the proton concentration

427
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,740
between the ocean waters and the alkaline fluids,

428
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,660
probably across these barriers,

429
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,100
across potentially quite short distances.

430
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,340
So we've got a system here,

431
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,420
which has a structure which is reminiscent of cells,

432
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,620
and we've got all the right ingredients

433
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,980
to be reacting together to make the components of cells.

434
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,820
So at least you can imagine

435
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:34,020
that this may be a suitable starting point for life.

436
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,900
So this is my hypothesis,

437
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,620
which is grounded in the work of the people

438
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,100
that I've been talking about,

439
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,780
but I'm not sure any of them would necessarily see it quite this way,

440
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,340
and I wouldn't have dared to show anybody this slide

441
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,220
even five or six years ago.

442
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,940
It's very simple, and I'll explain it briefly,

443
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,380
but I wouldn't have dared to say it

444
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,980
because there's big claims going on here,

445
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,420
and they're experimentally tractable questions,

446
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,420
and the reason I dare to show it to you now

447
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,980
is that a lot of them are beginning to show signs

448
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,380
that there's truth in them.

449
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,020
So imagine this is a paw

450
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,380
in one of these hydrothermal vents.

451
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,060
We've got acidic ocean waters percolating in.

452
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:16,860
We've got iron sulfur minerals in these barriers,

453
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,940
not just that, or silicate and carbonate and things as well,

454
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,980
but some iron sulfur minerals,

455
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,660
driving a reaction between hydrogen and CO2,

456
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,620
not necessarily a complete Krebs cycle,

457
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,740
but at least some of these intermediates in the Krebs cycle,

458
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,060
to make the most thermodynamically-favoured products.

459
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,140
Lipids, which is to say fatty acids,

460
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,980
long-chain hydrocarbons, and amino acids.

461
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:45,140
These are the two most thermodynamically-favoured groups.

462
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,380
If we did make lipids, we potentially would expect

463
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,380
that they would form some kind of a...

464
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,980
I'm going to call it a proto-cell.

465
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,580
It's got a bilayer membrane around it, and it's snuggling in.

466
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,220
I'm showing it deliberately snuggling into a paw here.

467
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,140
I'm exaggerating, but this, effectively,

468
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,140
this paw is templating a cell,

469
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,420
and the cell is snuggling in with a bilayer membrane around it,

470
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,340
and now it's a semi-closed system, and we can make more things,

471
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,420
not just lipids and amino acids, but also sugars, maybe nucleotides.

472
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:19,540
For this to be happening, we need that bit.

473
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,500
This iron-sulfur mineral.

474
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,500
Well, if we want to be fixing these things inside a proto-cell,

475
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,340
then this needs to be sticking in this membrane.

476
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,660
Protons need to be crossing that membrane.

477
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,100
We need to have all this happening inside, and a continuous flow.

478
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,220
So we're combining the structure of the vent

479
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,940
with the continuous flow of things.

480
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,500
And this, I hope, will be beginning to challenge you,

481
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,620
because, certainly, I would be thinking,

482
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:48,140
well, really, can we really believe that that's true?

483
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,460
And then, just as a final challenge,

484
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,860
if we can get as far as nucleotides,

485
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,300
then we can begin to have RNA.

486
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,580
We can begin to have a kind of an RNA world,

487
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,020
but inside these growing proto-cells,

488
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,220
and now we've got amino acids becoming peptides,

489
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,580
we've got RNA,

490
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,300
which is the kind of more reactive equivalent of DNA

491
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,260
if you're not so familiar with these things.

492
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,580
And the beginnings of making proteins,

493
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,900
the beginnings of information,

494
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,660
and the beginnings of real protein function in cells.

495
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,780
So it's a very simple hypothesis,

496
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,540
and it really challenges our ability

497
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,260
to believe our own hypotheses in science,

498
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,980
but the good thing is it is eminently testable.

499
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,220
So I'm going to run through,

500
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,820
and I'm going to show you a little bit of data with some of this,

501
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,460
and I kind of apologise for that

502
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,020
because it's not supposed to be a seminar,

503
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,660
but at the same time, if I just stand here and wave my arms around

504
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,260
and say, yeah, take it from me, it's really going to happen,

505
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,780
you really should not believe me.

506
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,260
So I'm going to show you that we can do some experiments,

507
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,980
that this is actually science,

508
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,860
and I'll show you the kind of experiments that we can do.

509
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,660
I'm going to skim over them quite lightly,

510
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,380
and if you've got questions, feel free to either interrupt

511
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,500
and ask as I'm going along, or ask at the end.

512
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,220
Anyway, so this idea that life is powered by electric membranes,

513
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,820
it goes back to 1961,

514
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,180
to a paper from Peter Mitchell in 1961

515
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,980
on what he called the chemiosmotic hypothesis,

516
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,380
and this is an older picture, and it's with Jennifer Moyle,

517
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:27,020
and Jennifer Moyle, she was working with Mitchell from 1947,

518
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,260
this is 1947 in Cambridge,

519
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,380
and she was a brilliant experimentalist,

520
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,060
and most of the good papers that they wrote together in the 1960s

521
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,380
on the chemiosmotic hypothesis

522
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,100
is the best papers were Mitchell and Moyle together,

523
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,700
and she did all the experimental work.

524
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,940
Mitchell was a brilliant theoretician,

525
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,740
he was cac-handed in the lab,

526
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,340
he could never finish an experiment,

527
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,940
it was Moyle that really did the experimental work,

528
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,940
and Mitchell, of course, perhaps you don't know,

529
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:59,220
but Mitchell in 1978 was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry by himself,

530
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,900
I'm increasingly thinking,

531
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,340
and I've been kind of digging around in the literature,

532
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,580
but I think now, if that were to happen,

533
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,540
then Moyle would have won the Nobel Prize with him,

534
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,740
I think luckily times are changing,

535
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,660
but I think that was a miscarriage of justice.

536
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,540
Anyway, before this hypothesis was first published in 1961,

537
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,100
Mitchell was a conference in Moscow, 1957,

538
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,740
on the origin of life, it was organised by Oparin,

539
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:31,220
who was a great Soviet, I suppose he was a chemist,

540
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,060
interested in the origin of life,

541
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,940
and a lot of the great scientists in the world at the time,

542
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,500
so people like J.V.S. Haldane was there,

543
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,460
and Mitchell himself was there as well,

544
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,380
and J.D. Bernal was there,

545
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,420
a lot of them were communists,

546
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,780
which was why they went to Moscow and why they were interested,

547
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:55,060
but it's also interesting that because there's such a materialistic basis

548
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,740
to Marxism and communism,

549
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,900
they were interested in questions like the origin of life

550
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,740
in a way that many other people weren't at the time,

551
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:05,700
so there's a reason why it was happening in Moscow.

552
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,580
Mitchell really was not a communist really at all,

553
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,500
in fact, he was from a very wealthy family,

554
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,940
and he used to drive a silver Rolls Royce around Cambridge

555
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,700
during the war time,

556
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,980
and this is quite a poetic view here,

557
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,140
I love this quote because it's eye-opening

558
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,580
when you think about the origin of life,

559
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,340
he says, I cannot consider the organism without its environment.

560
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,300
From a formal point of view,

561
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,420
the two may be regarded as equivalent phases

562
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,580
between which dynamic contact is maintained

563
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,180
by the membranes that separate and link them.

564
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,900
So the inside of a cell in the outside world are equivalent phases.

565
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,420
He's not separating life out and saying this is what life is

566
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,620
and this is what the environment is,

567
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,780
he's conflating them,

568
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,460
he's saying they're equivalent to each other,

569
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,940
which is a strange thing to say,

570
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,300
but if you're thinking about the origin of life

571
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,980
before there is such a thing as a cell that we would recognise,

572
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,980
before there is really an organism or a living system,

573
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,860
thinking about phases as your equivalent

574
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,460
separated and joined by a membrane

575
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,060
is a very productive way of thinking about the question.

576
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,420
And this is, to my mind,

577
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,780
what we have in a hydrothermal vent,

578
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,460
we have a barrier,

579
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,540
and we have alkaline hydrothermal fluids inside,

580
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,060
and we have acidic ocean waters on the outside,

581
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,940
and so the topology is equivalent to a bacterial cell.

582
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,060
Here's a bacterial cell.

583
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,300
We're pumping out protons,

584
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,580
and so it's relatively acidic on the outside

585
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,420
and it's relatively alkaline on the inside,

586
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,860
and potentially it's three pH units difference

587
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,220
between the inside and the outside.

588
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,140
So it's the same magnitude and it's the same topology as a cell.

589
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,980
So is there any way that we can kind of go from here to there?

590
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,180
The other thing to notice about this,

591
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,740
we're pumping out protons all the time in our own body,

592
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,540
but why?

593
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,620
Because we're putting them to work, to power work,

594
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:02,100
and so the influx of protons is driving work,

595
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,340
and the influx of protons across here

596
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,540
could potentially drive work as well.

597
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,060
What kind of work could it potentially do?

598
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,380
Before there are any enzymes, any genes,

599
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,180
any kind of structures that you would think

600
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,300
could do anything useful,

601
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,780
what on earth could it actually do?

602
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,100
Well, there is a simple answer,

603
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,660
and it's basically about driving growth.

604
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,140
Why would that happen?

605
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,260
The problem with hydrogen and CO2

606
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,420
is they're just not very reactive.

607
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,500
The first couple of steps to get them to react

608
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,820
is really difficult,

609
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,180
and so if you were to just take a mixture of gases,

610
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,100
hydrogen and CO2, and put them in a test tube

611
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,500
and heat them up to say 50 degrees

612
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,620
and shake them up for half a billion years,

613
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,100
nothing much is really going to happen.

614
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,300
Actually, thermodynamically, you should get cells.

615
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,660
Incredibly, you should get cells.

616
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,100
They are more thermodynamically favored

617
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,060
than just a mixture of hydrogen and CO2.

618
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,500
The problem is this first couple of steps

619
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,220
to get to formaldehyde is uphill.

620
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,700
We don't need to go into the details of redox chemistry.

621
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,860
All you really need to notice is it's uphill

622
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,460
and it's quite steeply uphill to get them to react.

623
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,260
But that is at the same pH.

624
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,220
What we actually have in a hydrothermal vent

625
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,860
is the alkaline fluids at pH 11

626
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,700
and the acidic ocean waters, let's say pH 6.

627
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,140
And now you can see it's downhill.

628
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,700
Why is it downhill?

629
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,660
It's quite simple, again, intuitively to understand.

630
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,420
If you imagine hydrogen gas,

631
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,060
it wants to pass its electrons onto something else.

632
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,300
That leaves behind the protons,

633
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,740
and the protons, well, that's what makes an acid.

634
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,980
So an acid is rich in protons.

635
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,860
If you make those protons in an alkaline environment,

636
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,220
they'll immediately react with hydroxide to form water.

637
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,620
It's a neutralisation reaction.

638
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,820
It's extremely rapid, it's thermodynamically favoured.

639
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,140
It's going to happen instantaneously and release a lot of heat.

640
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,020
So it's just a neutralisation.

641
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,700
If you try to release protons in an acidic environment,

642
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,380
well, you're making an acid more acid,

643
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,940
that's not really favoured in terms of chemistry.

644
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,300
So it's going to be much more reactive

645
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,740
in an alkaline environment.

646
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,020
And CO2, well, it picks up an electron,

647
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,460
now it's got a negative charge.

648
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,860
If it's in an acidic environment,

649
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,180
it can pick up a proton now.

650
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,420
It's balanced the charges now, another electron now,

651
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,900
another proton, and off we go, we can make it.

652
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,140
So it becomes easier.

653
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,820
CO2 becomes more reactive in an acidic environment.

654
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,500
And so its downhill is going to happen

655
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,900
so long as we have hydrogen in one phase at pH 11

656
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,660
and CO2 in a different phase at pH 6,

657
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,980
and they're not constantly mixing.

658
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,140
They're not just forming the same thing.

659
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,740
So that's what we have in these vents.

660
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,380
And this is a fairly simple experiment.

661
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,020
Actually, we've been building reactors

662
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,180
and trying to make these things react for quite a long time

663
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,780
and embarrassingly long time.

664
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,060
And it's got smaller and smaller

665
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,380
and more and more controllable.

666
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,780
And this is a microfluidic chip.

667
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,380
You can see it there as well.

668
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,220
Inside this anaerobic glove box.

669
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:07,420
And we have parallel flow, acidic flow with iron chloride

670
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,380
and alkaline flow with sodium sulfide.

671
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,460
And it precipitates this very thin barrier.

672
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,220
And what we're hoping is that protons or maybe electrons

673
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,060
when still not sure which, unbelievably,

674
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,340
will cross this barrier and reduce CO2

675
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,500
to make organic molecules.

676
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,300
Does it work?

677
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,260
Well, yes it does.

678
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,620
It's not hugely impressive, I have to admit.

679
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,620
It's taken a long time even to get to this.

680
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,500
This is the kind of thing, if you're not a scientist,

681
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,460
then maybe this will help you understand.

682
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,140
People get amazingly excited about that.

683
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,380
That is formate.

684
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,020
Which is to say, it's the very first step

685
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,740
of reacting hydrogen and CO2

686
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,620
to make the very first product.

687
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,780
So it's a step in the right direction.

688
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,620
And it's sticking up quite a long way above this baseline.

689
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,300
Sometimes this baseline is quite lumpy and bumpy

690
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,980
and so this is not a bad peak really.

691
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,580
And so it's proof that it can begin to happen.

692
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:12,660
And over here, this one is acetate,

693
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,700
which is two carbons joined together.

694
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,540
And we've managed to get three carbons joined together

695
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,220
and you'll probably be thinking, wow, well done.

696
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:24,420
But it's taken us 10 years.

697
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,940
It's a bit embarrassing, as I say.

698
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,700
Other people have gone much further

699
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,860
but they've very often used higher pressures

700
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,220
and all kinds of interesting minerals.

701
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,180
This is with very freshly precipitated

702
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,300
with just a pH gradient.

703
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,380
And if you cut out the pH gradient,

704
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,140
it doesn't work, you don't get anything.

705
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,580
If you cut out some of the transition metals like nickel,

706
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,940
it doesn't work, you don't get anything.

707
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,340
So even though it looks incredibly cheap,

708
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,380
it is actually quite exciting.

709
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,420
It's a proof of concept that a pH gradient across a barrier

710
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:58,540
will drive CO2 fixation and make the organic molecules.

711
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,580
And notice acetate, it's actually one of the Krebs cycle.

712
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,900
And the reverse Krebs cycle is one of the intermediates,

713
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,420
one of the universally conserved intermediates.

714
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,340
Now, I said other people have done more than we have.

715
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,140
We're now talking higher temperatures

716
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,780
and higher pressures and things like that.

717
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,980
But some people have produced longer chain fatty acids

718
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,100
doing that.

719
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,260
And they'd done that 20 years ago, actually,

720
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,980
not using pH gradients.

721
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,140
And we'd taken a selection of these and tried to see,

722
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,700
well, if you remember my picture,

723
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:37,700
I was showing you a proto cell nestling snugly inside a pore.

724
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,340
Well, that requires a bilayer membrane,

725
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,180
and that requires something really simple.

726
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,700
And so the question is, if we take these fatty acids that

727
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,820
have been made and something called fatty alcohols, which

728
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,540
also is kind of a long chain of covens joined together

729
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:52,060
with an alcohol group stuck on the end,

730
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,740
do we get things that look like proto cells?

731
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,980
And the answer is yes, this is cryoelectron microscopy,

732
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,820
and it's got a bilayer membrane around an aqueous space

733
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,420
inside these similar things.

734
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:07,460
This is confocal microscopy, and I think this one is at pH 7,

735
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,540
but this one's at pH 12, and these are also at pH 12.

736
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,780
So we are able to make them, and they

737
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,780
make stable proto cells quite beautiful to look at.

738
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,820
When you see them live, as it were,

739
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,020
they're moving around and doing interesting things.

740
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,580
They're quite dynamic.

741
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:28,660
So yes, and the question there was, well,

742
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,940
are they stable in these harsh conditions in a hydrothermal vent

743
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:36,420
at 70 degrees centigrade and pH 9 or 10 or 11,

744
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,900
and lots of salt and calcium and magnesium and all the rest of it?

745
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,420
And the answer is yes, that has all of those things in.

746
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:48,940
So it is quite easy to make them, it turns out.

747
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,300
And this, I'm not going to go through the details here,

748
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,060
but this is another thing where scientists get ridiculously

749
00:36:56,060 --> 00:37:00,980
excited about, let's say, that, this little shoulder here.

750
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,820
This is what's called UV-viz spectroscopy,

751
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:08,860
and that shoulder is diagnostic of what are called 4FE4S clusters,

752
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,860
which is a kind of little cube of iron and sulfur.

753
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,020
And they're found in some of the most important proteins

754
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,300
in biology, things like ferrodoxin, which

755
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,740
are directly doing CO2 fixation in pretty much all cells.

756
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,140
These are ancient proteins, and they always contain these little cubes

757
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,020
of iron and sulfur, and they're like minerals.

758
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,700
And actually, they're formed in the same way as minerals,

759
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,900
they form spontaneously.

760
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,020
And so this is the kind of the machinery,

761
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,700
this is the most simple machinery you could imagine for CO2

762
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,740
fixation, which is becoming biology.

763
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,460
And they have a diagnostic shoulder on UV-viz spectroscopy.

764
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,780
So as soon as you see this, you think, whoa,

765
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:51,980
we expected that we would mix iron chloride and sodium sulfide

766
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:56,140
and cystin, the amino acid cystin, at pH 9, and we mix it up.

767
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:01,540
And what I thought we would see would be smaller crystals, big things,

768
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,780
but getting smaller coated in cystin.

769
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,740
That's kind of what I expected to see.

770
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,220
I didn't expect to see that.

771
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,820
Suddenly, we've gone from when you do it without the cystin,

772
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:14,260
everything goes black.

773
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:18,220
You just form the mineral, you just form iron sulfide minerals,

774
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,860
and everything goes black.

775
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,740
And when we first started doing these experiments quite a while ago

776
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,780
now, the first PhD student I had,

777
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,980
she became terribly depressed in the first month or two

778
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,740
because every experiment just went black every time.

779
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,540
It was nothing, it took a long time to figure out

780
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,500
we need alkaline pH, and we need all the, you know.

781
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,500
So surprisingly, again, surprisingly long time,

782
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,220
and eventually we get through to forming these,

783
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,020
it depends on the amount of cystin that you have,

784
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,660
it depends on the concentration of iron,

785
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,300
and I won't go through the details of these.

786
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,500
Here's what these little clusters look like.

787
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,620
That is this that I showed you.

788
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,980
This is from my original slide that I showed you.

789
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,140
So what I'm saying is it's quite easy to make

790
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,820
the bilayer membrane surrounding it,

791
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:07,620
and it's quite easy to make these little clusters of iron and sulfide

792
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,180
that are doing CO2 fixation in modern cells.

793
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,060
They have exactly the same chemistry.

794
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,180
And they will fix CO2.

795
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,860
This is formate, and this is acetate,

796
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,580
and again, I won't go through the details,

797
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,060
but the green one here is just pure water.

798
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,100
This is done on an electrode,

799
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,380
so there is an electrical potential here as well,

800
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:28,260
but when we have the clusters, we get an awful lot more

801
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:31,020
than you get in the absence of the clusters.

802
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,300
So again, it does work.

803
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:36,740
We can effectively build this machinery that life uses

804
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,260
with the most simple imaginable ingredients.

805
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,900
Okay, so that's effectively turning gases

806
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,020
into the core molecules of life.

807
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,620
What happens next?

808
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,340
Well, metabolism.

809
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,140
This is a tube map of metabolism,

810
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,460
the kind of London underground.

811
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,700
The remarkable thing about it is that this basic topology

812
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,700
is again, it's conserved across all of life.

813
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,180
You don't need to worry about the details,

814
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,140
but that kind of map, it's like,

815
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,980
imagine that you go to Paris

816
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,620
and you look at the underground map in Paris

817
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,220
and you find it's exactly the same

818
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,220
as the underground map in London.

819
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,220
And you go to New York,

820
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,900
and it's exactly, it's not the same conceptory.

821
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,780
It's got the same stations.

822
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,620
It's incredible.

823
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,460
Everything is exactly the same.

824
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,980
What's happening down these is,

825
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,580
not as if you've just got some kind of flow going down.

826
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,300
What's really happening is each of these molecules

827
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,900
is converting into another molecule.

828
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,860
So this is the kind of the line going from pyruvate

829
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:41,020
through to valine, for example, or to alanine.

830
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:46,020
These are molecules being converted into other things.

831
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,460
So it's not very equivalent to a tube map in that sense,

832
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:56,340
but it's remarkable that the genes that code for this map,

833
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,300
they're not the same.

834
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,900
I mean, some of them are the same,

835
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,860
but most of them are different in, for example,

836
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,900
bacteria and archaea, two of the domains of life.

837
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,140
And what that suggests is that this tube map

838
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,020
is actually older than the genes.

839
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,220
Now, again, that's something of an assertion,

840
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,180
but what it suggests then is that a lot of it

841
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,380
should happen spontaneously,

842
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,140
that we should be able to just do this chemistry in the lab

843
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,340
without there being any enzymes there,

844
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,700
any genetic programming there,

845
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,500
nothing which should just happen spontaneously

846
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,820
in the right environment.

847
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:31,020
And this is just one example showing more or less that.

848
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,100
We're starting with, let me just go back a moment,

849
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,420
oxaloacetate, which is here, so we're just feeding it this.

850
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,940
And we're looking to see if we get a spartate.

851
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,420
This is a very difficult reaction

852
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,900
and has never been done before.

853
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,460
And what we're also seeing,

854
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,260
we're seeing alanine and pyruvate and glycine and serine.

855
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,420
So this is alanine.

856
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,500
These are different metal ions that we're using,

857
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,900
so I won't spend much time on the details.

858
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,260
We're getting not large amounts,

859
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,540
but hundreds of micro molar with copper and with ferric iron,

860
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,860
but nothing with those.

861
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,020
A spartate is quite hard,

862
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,340
but some metal ions do the job.

863
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:09,460
But we're also getting glycine and serine and alanine.

864
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,460
And this was on GCMS.

865
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,260
This is just what we measured,

866
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:18,060
which means that we've got this flow going through this system.

867
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,780
And it's not coming out with other things.

868
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,220
We are, it's like the train is following the lines

869
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,140
even in the absence of any gene.

870
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,900
So it's not much, but it's there.

871
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:29,420
And we've also got through as far as cysteine, for example,

872
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,700
so all the way through to here,

873
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,340
which is what's binding those iron sulfur clusters.

874
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,780
So this is early days.

875
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,700
There's another group in Strasbourg

876
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,420
who's done more of this kind of work than we have.

877
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,220
They've managed to do pretty much all of the Krebs cycle,

878
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,620
pretty much most of this pathway coming down here.

879
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,660
And now we've also done sugar synthesis

880
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,020
coming through to ribose and so on.

881
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,100
A lot of this map has been done in the lab

882
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:58,140
in the last 10 years, since 2015, eight years.

883
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,220
And it works.

884
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,100
Not everyone's done it under the same conditions.

885
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,260
It's not as if we start here and just go whoosh

886
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,140
right the way through this whole system.

887
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,060
One group does this little bit, another group does that bit,

888
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,980
someone else does this bit.

889
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,140
But it's interesting that piecing it together,

890
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,060
it seems to be spontaneous chemistry.

891
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,780
It's a lot harder to try and get flow going through

892
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,900
the entire system that could date years,

893
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,420
possibly decades, who knows.

894
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,660
But at least it begins to give you a little faith,

895
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,420
I would say, that this kind of chemistry is really possible.

896
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,420
Think about the earlier four billion years ago.

897
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:37,140
We've got an entire planet covered in hydrothermal vents,

898
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,580
covered in these hydrothermal systems.

899
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,980
There was no distinction between the crust and the mantle

900
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,220
at that time, so these vent systems were everywhere.

901
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,260
And how many million years do you want?

902
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,780
So the idea that in the scope of a PhD thesis

903
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,820
on a bench top in a small lab,

904
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,020
which is always struggling to get funded,

905
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,820
that we can make all of this stuff happen,

906
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,540
of course it's not going to happen.

907
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:02,260
If we can get anything to happen at all,

908
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,340
it's a step in the direction.

909
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,460
So I think again, to return to my point at the beginning,

910
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,500
intellectually we're beginning to get a feel

911
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,900
for how this kind of chemistry might work out.

912
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,100
And we're beginning to do the experiments

913
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,260
that suggest that it's not completely impossible.

914
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,180
It's not utterly improbable.

915
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,980
This was showing that we can make uracil,

916
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:24,780
which is one of the letters in RNA and DNA.

917
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,180
This is not too many steps,

918
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:28,500
but we start with ammonia and carbonate and aspartate,

919
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,180
and we can go right the way through there.

920
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:33,460
This is uracil and oratate as a one-pot synthesis.

921
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,140
And when we optimize the conditions,

922
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,100
we got about 10 times as much uracil,

923
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,860
just in these last three steps here.

924
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,940
And interestingly, those conditions turned out to be

925
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,780
90 degrees centigrade, pH 8.5,

926
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:49,860
one molar sodium chloride.

927
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,740
So quite similar to alkaline hydrothermal vents.

928
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,460
So again, this is just showing that whole pathways

929
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,860
can spontaneously happen.

930
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:58,980
And this is an interesting one.

931
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,020
This is ATP that I mentioned at the beginning.

932
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:04,820
These days, it's made by this astonishing rotating motor,

933
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:09,220
the ATP synthase, which is the membrane here.

934
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:13,220
It's got this literally rotating motor and it's making ATP.

935
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,860
It's one of the most magical molecular machines.

936
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,620
It's just beautiful.

937
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,460
And it's rotating.

938
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,700
This is not really rotating slowly like that.

939
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,620
It's going 200 times revolutions a second,

940
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,380
up to 500 revolutions a second.

941
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,020
It's extraordinary fast.

942
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,220
And it's just phosphorylating ATP to ATP.

943
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:38,700
So it's adding a phosphate group on to ADP.

944
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,140
And it's been a big question,

945
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:43,420
how do we make ATP then in the absence

946
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,900
of a sophisticated protein like that?

947
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,300
There are ways of doing it.

948
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,420
But here's, this is just showing again,

949
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,540
with peric iron and water and two-carbon acetyl phosphate,

950
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:57,180
we get about 15% to 20% yield of ATP.

951
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:00,860
It varies depending on the temperature.

952
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:03,860
Most metal ions didn't work, only peric iron worked.

953
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:07,140
And we could do it with ATP, but not with the other bases.

954
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,980
So why is it the universal energy currency in part

955
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,580
because you can make it in water with peric iron as a catalyst

956
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:17,220
and acetyl phosphate as a phosphate donor?

957
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,580
So it's prebiotic chemistry.

958
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,580
It works and you get specifically ATP.

959
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,020
We're not synthesizing ATP all the steps.

960
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,900
This is just the last bit of phosphorylating,

961
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,420
but it's interesting that it works.

962
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,020
Okay, information.

963
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,780
And keep an eye on the time.

964
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:33,740
I'm going a little slow.

965
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,180
Are you all right?

966
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,580
Should we have a music break?

967
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,740
I'll keep going for now.

968
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:42,940
So information.

969
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:44,660
This is kind of what you've seen already.

970
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,460
This is the pattern of metabolism.

971
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,780
I'm talking about pyruvate.

972
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,820
These are the Krebs cycle intermediates up here.

973
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,820
And it's color coded.

974
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,700
These are all amino acids.

975
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:58,980
And in gray, they all have a G at the first position of the codon.

976
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:06,180
So in DNA and RNA, each amino acid is encoded by three letters.

977
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,460
It's called a codon.

978
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:13,220
And those three letters in the first one for glycine

979
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,100
is always a G and so on.

980
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:20,780
This is when the first letter is an A for adenosine.

981
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,700
In blue, it's encoded by cytidine.

982
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:27,980
And in green, it's by a U.

983
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,580
And you can see immediately looking at that,

984
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,020
that there's some interesting structure there.

985
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:37,020
That it looks as if the G is very close to CO2 fixation

986
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,580
and the blue ones are much further away.

987
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,820
And that is indeed the case.

988
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,340
We see a kind of correlation.

989
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:48,580
It's a reasonable correlation, not perfect, but this is the number of steps

990
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,700
from CO2 to the amino acid.

991
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:53,620
And it's the shorter distance from G to U.

992
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:57,380
The outlier down here is cysteine, which is that one,

993
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:04,180
which we have reasons why we can explain why that's an outlier, we think.

994
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,020
That's the first position of the codon.

995
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,700
If we organize this by the first position of the codon,

996
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:13,780
so a G or an A at that first position or a C or a U,

997
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,300
this is the second position of the anticodon.

998
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:20,820
And this is the hydrophobicity.

999
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:26,580
And so the V is valine, it's a very hydrophobic amino acid.

1000
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:30,940
And it's encoded, the colors changed here, unfortunately, this is now an A.

1001
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:36,340
So valine is encoded at the second position of the anticodon by an A,

1002
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,260
which is the most hydrophobic base.

1003
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,380
So we have effectively the most hydrophobic base encodes,

1004
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,380
the most hydrophobic amino acid.

1005
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,380
And here we have a spartate, and it's encoded by a U,

1006
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:52,100
which is the most hydrophilic amino acid encoded by the most hydrophilic base.

1007
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:57,980
So we see this relationship between how much water-loving or water-hating they are.

1008
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:01,300
It suggests they're snuggling up to each other in some way.

1009
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:06,660
It's less strong if we're further away, if we're looking at C and U,

1010
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:10,380
so these were the ones that were further away at the first position.

1011
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,620
There is a relationship, but it's not very impressive.

1012
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:16,380
But these first two, it really does look as if there are direct interactions

1013
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,660
between amino acids and the bases that code for them.

1014
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:25,220
And this is a third position, and this is what's called an inverted codon table.

1015
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:28,700
So first of all, most people would think that the third position

1016
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,940
is usually just thought of as redundant.

1017
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:34,540
There's not much information in that third position.

1018
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,260
So where it's white, it is redundant.

1019
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:40,940
There can be more than one amino acid encoded there.

1020
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,860
But where it's coloured, these are not redundant.

1021
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,980
It's a single amino acid is encoded by that.

1022
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,460
So you can see immediately that it's not a random patterning.

1023
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,380
The redundancy itself is not random in the genetic code.

1024
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:58,580
And if I just consider one example, so this is glutamate,

1025
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,300
and it's the same colour as a spartate over here,

1026
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,180
they've both got a G at the first position of the codon,

1027
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:08,220
they've both got an A at the second position of the codon,

1028
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:12,940
but this glutamate has a purine, and a spartate has a pyrimidine.

1029
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:15,100
Now, pyrimidines have got two rings, they're bigger.

1030
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,620
Pyrimidines have got a single ring, they're smaller.

1031
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:20,300
And it corresponds to the size of the amino acid.

1032
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:26,100
So we can predict most of the code on the basis of these interactions.

1033
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,820
It's kind of circular, we're predicting the code from patterns

1034
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,780
that are inside the code anyway, so there's some problem here.

1035
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,620
But we can also test these things,

1036
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:40,140
and we've done molecular dynamic simulations and NMR.

1037
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,060
And I'll just give one example here.

1038
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,540
So this is the amino acid proline,

1039
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,700
and we're looking to see how much time does it spend

1040
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,900
close to each of these bases A, C, G or U,

1041
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:54,140
and within about two angstroms, so really snuggling up,

1042
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,580
it's spending a lot of time with a G,

1043
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:59,700
and it's not spending so much time with the other bases.

1044
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:03,980
G is the one that encodes it at the second position of the anticodon.

1045
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,340
For arginine, we also get it correct,

1046
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,780
but there's a lot of overlap here, so it's kind of weak and statistical,

1047
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:16,180
but we can predict about 50% of the code on these interactions.

1048
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:22,100
And it's interesting, this is the one, so here, for example,

1049
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:28,980
with proline, we think that it should be with a G, and that's here.

1050
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:33,820
So we think G first, and then so this is the second guess,

1051
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:36,100
this is the third one, and this is the worst one.

1052
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,220
And I've put a ring around the correct base,

1053
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,900
and they're organised according to a hydrophobicity.

1054
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,700
So these things are very hydrophobic, these things are very hydrophilic,

1055
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:48,700
and we get 50% correct, but they're all the hydrophilic end.

1056
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:51,940
At the hydrophobic end, we don't do very well.

1057
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,900
So this molecular dynamic simulations,

1058
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,700
I'm not really a proper chemist,

1059
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,420
it's all about the forces between atoms,

1060
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:05,100
and how strong are hydrophobic interactions,

1061
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,780
or how strong is charge interactions,

1062
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:09,180
over what distance does it operate, and so on.

1063
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,020
And they're a little bit clunky,

1064
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:14,900
and they don't seem to be very good at these hydrophobic ones.

1065
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,460
We did that with two different programmes,

1066
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,100
and we got the same results, more or less.

1067
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,540
And we got the same thing with NMR as well.

1068
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,900
NMR also has a problem with hydrophobicity,

1069
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:25,740
because you can't dissolve hydrophobic amino acids in water

1070
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:27,580
at a high concentration, or the bases,

1071
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,540
and so you don't have a good signal.

1072
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,860
So it's very messy.

1073
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,180
It's funny, this is chemistry that people have been doing

1074
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:36,060
over decades, and it's still messy.

1075
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,900
But there is a pattern,

1076
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,980
and it seems to be supported by the data,

1077
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,500
and that can explain the origins of information in biology.

1078
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,060
This is a summary slide of everything I've said, really.

1079
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,380
We've got a proton gradient across a membrane,

1080
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,780
driving the reaction between hydrogen and CO2,

1081
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:55,180
going into a proto metabolism, making amino acids,

1082
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,660
and nucleotides.

1083
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,420
We're polymerising the nucleotides to make RNA,

1084
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:03,620
polymerising the amino acids to make peptides.

1085
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:06,380
We have stereochemical interactions between them.

1086
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,180
We've got something like translation going on here,

1087
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,300
making these things,

1088
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,180
and we have all kinds of positive feedback loops

1089
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,740
interacting there,

1090
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,100
which can make this system increase.

1091
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:18,620
I'm not going to go through the details of this,

1092
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,460
but we can imagine very simple ways

1093
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,180
in which these amino acids can interact

1094
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:26,020
with very small aptomers of RNA.

1095
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,300
Right, for the last 10 minutes,

1096
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:34,060
I'm just going to touch on consciousness in bacteria,

1097
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,380
not in us.

1098
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,700
When I say consciousness, let me confess,

1099
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,540
probably what I'm going to talk about

1100
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,540
is not what you would understand by consciousness.

1101
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:47,020
But the question for me is a biochemist for a long time,

1102
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,380
and I've never understood it,

1103
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:52,380
is what are feelings in biochemical terms?

1104
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,140
What we seem to care most about, I think, as humans,

1105
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,860
and what we're scared about with AI and so on,

1106
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,820
is will it become scarily human?

1107
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,420
Will it become conscious?

1108
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,020
Will it start being sentient,

1109
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:08,300
have feelings, all of these kind of things?

1110
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:12,220
A lot of people in the AI world are very interested now

1111
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:15,460
in what does biology have to say about consciousness,

1112
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,540
and the answer is, well, not very much.

1113
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:21,660
It's been known as the hard problem for quite a long time,

1114
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:23,220
and the hard problem, more or less,

1115
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,380
is why is it that a feeling of pain,

1116
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:28,700
or of hunger, or thirst, or whatever it may be,

1117
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,380
what actually is that in terms of biochemistry?

1118
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,980
If a neuron depolarises,

1119
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:37,300
why does it give rise to a feeling of anything at all?

1120
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:41,180
Now, in my view, it evolved,

1121
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:46,300
but if it evolved, then natural selection acted on something,

1122
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:49,340
and the question is, well, how far back does that go?

1123
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,340
You can anesthetise all kinds of things,

1124
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,580
you can anesthetise anomeba,

1125
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,740
you can anesthetise bacteria.

1126
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:58,420
So whatever it is that anesthetics are doing to consciousness

1127
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,620
is not only at the level of a central nervous system,

1128
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:03,340
it's also at the level of single-celled critters.

1129
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,940
So what's happening?

1130
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,180
What I've been saying about how bacteria,

1131
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:11,180
how life started, this structure of cells,

1132
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,940
and the three parts I've been talking about,

1133
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:16,380
and especially the electric membranes,

1134
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:21,980
what I'm going to put to you is that the electromagnetic fields,

1135
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,900
electrostatic electromagnetic fields on these membranes

1136
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,460
give a real-time integrated feedback to a bacterial cell

1137
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,540
about how they're doing in the world,

1138
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,500
and I'll explain that to you and then why that may lead

1139
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:38,380
to the basis for amplifying everything as consciousness.

1140
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,500
So a real-time integrated feedback on your state in the world,

1141
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,140
I would say that's how it feels to be right now,

1142
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,100
and for a bacterial cell that means,

1143
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,540
am I good or am I bad, really not much more than that.

1144
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:53,060
It's a kind of little bit of a binary system.

1145
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:56,340
So imagine, here's a bacterial cell,

1146
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,300
we've got the outside world and stuff happens in the outside world,

1147
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,860
and it needs to detect whatever's going on out there

1148
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,380
and do something.

1149
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,980
It's a living cell.

1150
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:10,180
It's inside all this God, it's the metabolism,

1151
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,660
all this stuff I've been talking about,

1152
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,100
all of these billions of reactions every second

1153
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,740
that's going on inside, there's nothing else in there.

1154
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,380
It's just chemistry.

1155
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,940
It's got genes in there, but genes are slow as well,

1156
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,260
so it's interesting.

1157
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,860
We've got literally one billion reactions a second

1158
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:29,580
going on inside here, and somehow they're going to determine

1159
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:33,220
what that cell decides it's going to do.

1160
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:37,180
So what I've been telling you about is this Krebs cycle,

1161
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,980
and I'm keeping with the oxidative one here,

1162
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,660
we're stripping out hydrogen CO2,

1163
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,300
we've got food coming in,

1164
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,580
and we're pumping protons across that membrane

1165
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:48,580
to generate an electrical charge on the membrane.

1166
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:51,140
So this is what I've been setting up all along.

1167
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,700
But we don't have just one Krebs cycle in there,

1168
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,420
we actually have scores of them,

1169
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:58,980
probably thousands of them all spinning at the same time,

1170
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:02,260
potentially at different rates.

1171
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,460
There's all kinds of things that could be going on.

1172
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:09,700
So what is synchronising that cell at the same rate?

1173
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,940
To a larger extent, it's the charge on the membrane,

1174
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:13,700
because all of them are plugged into the membrane,

1175
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,260
and for them to spin,

1176
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:18,100
they've got to push against the same force.

1177
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,620
And also that force is powering ATP synthesis,

1178
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,500
and for a lot of chemistry to happen in the cell,

1179
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:28,020
you need ATP, and it needs to be far from equilibrium,

1180
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:31,820
which is to say you need that ratio of ATP to ADP

1181
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,340
to be a similar distance away.

1182
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:36,060
So this charge on the membrane

1183
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:39,060
is going to be forcing all of the biochemistry of the cell

1184
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,180
into effectively the same state,

1185
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,220
the same rate of operating,

1186
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,140
and you can gauge what that is

1187
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:48,340
from the strength of the charge on the membrane.

1188
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:52,660
And also, because this is moving charge,

1189
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:55,620
it will be generating electromagnetic fields as well.

1190
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:57,540
I suspect, but cannot prove to you

1191
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,380
that there's a balance between electromagnetic

1192
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,420
and electrostatic fields that they can pick up on,

1193
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,980
which gives them an idea of how they're doing

1194
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,900
in relation to the environment.

1195
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,740
So it needs to make a kind of a binary decision.

1196
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:11,260
Let's imagine it's too hot,

1197
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,540
or maybe there's toxins there.

1198
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,500
What are you going to do?

1199
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,460
Are you going to stay, or are you going to go?

1200
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:19,020
Are you going to paddle with your flagellum and move across?

1201
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,260
It's a two-bit decision.

1202
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:24,220
Ready? Either you stay or you go.

1203
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,060
One bit.

1204
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:29,060
So you need to integrate all this information

1205
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,020
on your state in the world.

1206
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:33,220
Now, it could be that it's too hot.

1207
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:34,060
What am I going to do?

1208
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,580
My proteins are beginning to unravel,

1209
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,140
they're beginning to come undone.

1210
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:39,260
I'm going to set off some genes.

1211
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:41,740
I'm going to activate some genes and a stress response,

1212
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:43,300
which is going to fix my proteins.

1213
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,420
But it's going to take half an hour

1214
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:47,060
before these things are ready.

1215
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,540
And the proteins, I need to refold them.

1216
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,980
That's going to take minutes.

1217
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:52,980
I can activate very...

1218
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,780
But how do I know what I just did?

1219
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:59,220
I need to have some idea now

1220
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,980
about what my predicament is in the outside world.

1221
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,260
I need to know it's too hot.

1222
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,580
There has to be some information

1223
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,420
that this system is giving me about my predicament.

1224
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:11,460
I don't know yet because I just set off a gene response,

1225
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,620
which is doing something,

1226
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,140
but I don't know which genes I triggered

1227
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,340
and I don't know what the problem is.

1228
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:18,260
So this is where a feeling is beginning to come in.

1229
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,460
It's effectively, I think it's too hot.

1230
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,700
I should move over there

1231
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,380
in terms of the fields on the membrane,

1232
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,460
which is telling you the states that you're in.

1233
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:30,220
It's integrating all this information on the membrane.

1234
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:31,860
So that's what I'm proposing.

1235
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,940
It's not completely hand-waving.

1236
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,460
I mean, this, I admit, immediately

1237
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,140
is the more hand-wavy bit of the talk.

1238
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:42,700
I think the origin of life stuff is becoming science.

1239
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,220
This is still philosophy, perhaps more than science,

1240
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:47,060
but it's an interesting starting point.

1241
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,260
But there is also some data.

1242
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:50,620
So, for example, these are phages,

1243
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:54,060
bacteria phages attacking a bacterium.

1244
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,740
And it's quite interesting what happens

1245
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:58,900
because lots of bacteria will kill themselves,

1246
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,500
especially if they're part of a larger colony,

1247
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:02,900
a biofilm, for example,

1248
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,740
or some kind of ocean bloom of bacteria.

1249
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:08,580
Why would they do that?

1250
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,460
Why would a single cell kill itself?

1251
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:12,500
Well, the answer, it's standard biology.

1252
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,980
It's what's called kin selection.

1253
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:17,020
And effectively, if you kill yourself,

1254
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,660
you also prevent the viruses

1255
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,380
from making copies of themselves.

1256
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,020
Then they can't infect the next cell.

1257
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:25,740
And so your genes and so on will do better in your relatives.

1258
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:28,620
You don't even have to be very closely related to the next cell.

1259
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,860
Still, you'll be somewhat related

1260
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,180
and your genes will do better if you kill yourself.

1261
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,460
So how do you, if you're in this predicament

1262
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,100
of being taken down by viruses,

1263
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,700
how do you kill yourself?

1264
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,700
The answer is you unplug the membrane.

1265
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,500
You collapse the membrane potential.

1266
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,620
That's what you do.

1267
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,660
That will kill you in seconds.

1268
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,700
So this is really bacterial death.

1269
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:50,700
It's all about the membrane potential,

1270
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,220
which makes me think,

1271
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:55,140
when they paddle, I showed you them paddling around,

1272
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:57,300
this is proton powered.

1273
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:01,620
Again, all the behaviour that bacteria do,

1274
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,140
all the import and export of things across that membrane

1275
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:07,500
is all powered by that membrane potential.

1276
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,100
So this is very much the life and death

1277
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,100
of what bacterial cells are actually doing.

1278
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:16,060
Now, this I think is the final slide.

1279
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:22,460
We are made of more complex cells.

1280
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,860
We're made of eukaryotic cells.

1281
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:26,340
Eukaryotes have lots of mitochondria.

1282
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:27,940
These are the same things I've been showing you.

1283
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:30,780
These are all individual bacteria that became included

1284
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:32,220
in a much larger cell,

1285
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,980
or it became a larger cell in the end.

1286
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,460
And they're all doing the same kind of thing,

1287
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,940
but now they've got to speak to each other.

1288
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,340
There's different ways they can do that.

1289
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,940
They can fuse together and fission.

1290
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,540
There's all kinds of things they do,

1291
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:47,700
but somehow they're all together responsible for metabolism.

1292
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:50,060
And in a strange way, because when we breathe oxygen,

1293
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:51,540
it's going straight here.

1294
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,380
And when we're digesting food and burning food,

1295
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,700
it's going straight here.

1296
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:58,980
So although this is the interface with the world,

1297
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,020
really what's happening is going on here.

1298
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:03,500
Any problems that we have in relation to the world,

1299
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,660
we feel them foremost in our mitochondria.

1300
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,780
And we need to integrate this information

1301
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:11,300
across maybe hundreds or thousands of mitochondria.

1302
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,940
And again, I'm thinking that fields are one way

1303
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,540
in which this can happen.

1304
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:18,300
And then this is a single cell like an amoeba cell.

1305
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,220
Then we have multicellular organisms,

1306
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:22,060
and now we've got cells to bring together

1307
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,580
all with these moving parts inside.

1308
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:25,780
And finally, a central nervous system,

1309
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:27,500
which amplifies all of this.

1310
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,380
So the communications, the electrical communications

1311
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,140
between single cells and their interface with the world,

1312
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:35,100
becoming incorporated into larger cells,

1313
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,780
incorporated into multicellular organisms,

1314
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:39,420
and finally into a central nervous system.

1315
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:41,820
This, I'm suggesting, is the substrate,

1316
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:45,180
which gives rise in the end to the complexity

1317
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:46,740
of our own consciousness.

1318
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:49,820
This is what I've said.

1319
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,060
Perhaps I don't need to say it again.

1320
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,380
I feel like I'm running out of time.

1321
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:55,060
So what I'm going to say instead is thank you

1322
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,580
to the guys in my lab who've been working on this.

1323
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,740
It's pretty brave for them to do it at all.

1324
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,660
This is, in fact, an old slide.

1325
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,940
They're holding the Krebs cycle, and I like that so much.

1326
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:06,860
It was a birthday present a few years ago that I've kept it.

1327
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,420
So half these guys have now left my lab,

1328
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:10,340
and I've had to put the ones who've joined

1329
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,100
since then around the outside.

1330
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,860
I suppose I'll have to change this at some point,

1331
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:19,020
but it's a brave thing to do a PhD on the origin of life.

1332
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:21,540
And I'm beginning to start thinking about doing experiments

1333
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,740
on consciousness, which is probably even more foolhardy

1334
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,220
for them to join me.

1335
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,260
So I want to thank them especially.

1336
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,460
Thanks to the funders, and thank you very much

1337
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:30,980
for the invitation and for listening,

1338
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,900
and I'm very happy to take questions.

1339
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,540
