81020	86820	I don't know if this is going to challenge the ethics, but I hope that it might lead to something of a debate towards the end.
86820	94700	OK. First thing to say is, we will never know how life started on Earth.
94700	101660	Even if we invented a time machine and we were able to go back four billion years to the origin of life,
101660	107060	we could not agree among ourselves as scientists in this field, where should we go?
107060	111260	Should we go into the atmosphere? Should we find a beach?
111260	116340	These are stromatolites that you can see. It's actually living rocks, you may say.
116340	119620	Should we go down into the depths of the ocean?
119620	125300	Scientists who work in the field cannot agree with each other about things as simple, you may say, as that.
125300	133740	And if we actually did succeed in agreeing on where to go and we go there and we find some green slime on a rock,
133820	142340	do we know if this is a step en route to the origin of life, or is this some side alley going nowhere in particular?
142340	144740	Again, we have no way of knowing.
144740	149100	So even if we had a time machine, we still wouldn't be able to answer the question.
149100	153660	So you may think it's completely hopeless. Why am I even standing here?
153660	157180	Well, we can. We can hope to understand it.
157180	159620	That's really what we're trying to do.
159620	165860	I don't think there's any likelihood that over the next, say, five to ten years, as some people claim,
165860	171740	that we will succeed in producing life in the lab and we'll have cells growing out of some test tube or something.
171740	174740	I think we are miles and miles away from doing that.
174740	180900	But we can try to understand the kinds of environments, the kind of chemistry going on and all the steps.
180900	187860	We can work out an intellectual framework that will explain how a wet rocky planet with no life on it whatsoever
187860	192420	can give rise to the kind of glorious planet that we live on.
192420	196540	How can we even think about that transition?
196540	198060	I think we can.
198060	203460	What I'd like to try and get across to you this evening is that we're beginning to have some ideas.
203460	206380	At least some people agree with them. Some people don't.
206380	211300	But I want to try and persuade you that it's not just hand waving.
211300	214700	So how do we begin to think about it?
214700	220460	I would say for the last 50, 60 years or so, the guide to the origin of life has really been chemistry.
220460	225060	What chemistry actually works and which chemistry doesn't work so well.
225060	231940	Over the last perhaps 15, 20 years, biology has become involved for the first time.
231940	236980	Until then, surprisingly, biologists had almost nothing to say on the origin of life.
236980	241620	It was dismissed as armchair speculation of the worst kind, not science at all.
241620	245900	Whereas the chemists were thinking, OK, here's an interesting challenge in synthetic chemistry.
245900	250020	Can we make the nucleotides that make up DNA or RNA? Can we make the sugars?
250020	253380	Can we make the lipids to make membranes and so on?
253380	257940	It was a valid question in synthetic chemistry and they've made all of these things.
257940	263420	Then you have a little problem about, OK, you put them all together in a pot and then what happens?
263420	266820	It doesn't just kind of congeal into cells and start crawling out.
266820	269900	So there's something missing still.
269940	275420	Biology, life itself, is an interesting guide and what I'm going to try and suggest to you is that
275420	279500	it's in fact an excellent guide in three different areas.
279500	285780	Energy, metabolism, which is one of those words that tend to put a lot of people off,
285780	288300	but I'll try and explain this as likely as I can.
288300	289900	And then genetic information, genes.
289900	292380	Where does information in biology come from?
292380	297220	Which I think a lot of people find more interesting than metabolism.
297220	300380	On the other hand, it can become quite obscure quite quickly.
300380	303940	When you see the two together, it makes much more sense.
303940	307780	So before I get going, I'm going to orientate you to those three themes.
307780	311260	This is, you could think of this as a bacterial cell.
311260	315180	You could think of this as the mitochondria inside your own cells.
315180	317700	The mitochondria are the power packs inside your cells.
317700	321300	And this is what's happening inside you right now.
321300	324020	Keep this as simple as I can. We're burning glucose.
324020	326540	We're breaking it down to an intermediate.
326540	329540	You don't even don't need to know the name of it, Acetyl CoA.
329540	332100	And we go through this thing called the Krebs cycle.
332100	335980	And the Krebs cycle is basically pulling out CO2 and hydrogen.
335980	338100	That's all I really want you to get from this.
338100	341980	CO2 is a way of breathing it out into the atmosphere,
341980	344500	contributing our own little bit to global warming.
344500	347820	And the hydrogen, while we're splitting the hydrogen,
347820	349620	the hydrogen atoms, two hydrogen atoms,
349620	352420	we're splitting them into their fundamental parts,
352420	354260	the electrons and the protons.
354340	358940	We have a current of electrons going to oxygen.
358940	361020	That current of electrons,
361020	364900	literally pretty much an electric wire inside this membrane,
364900	366260	inside this insulated membrane,
366260	370460	is powering the extrusion of protons across the membrane.
370460	373740	So now we have a lot of protons on this side of the membrane,
373740	376140	very few protons on the inside.
376140	377900	About three orders of magnitude difference,
377900	380780	three pH units difference.
380780	383740	Now that may not seem like very much.
383740	389220	It's about an electrical charge of about 150 to 200 millivolts.
389220	392380	But if you were to shrink yourself down to the size of a molecule
392380	395340	and stand right next to this membrane there,
395340	398380	you would experience an electrical field strength
398380	401940	of about 30 million volts per metre.
401940	404260	That's equivalent to a bolt of lightning.
404260	407780	So this entire surface area of membrane
407780	410260	has got an electrical charge equivalent to a bolt of lightning
410260	411260	going across it.
411260	414060	It's just such a small distance, five nanometres,
414060	417300	that the actual charge is quite small.
417300	419980	But it's quite a field strength.
419980	422060	That is powering everything.
422060	425180	I'm showing here a protein called the ATP synthase.
425180	426580	I'll come back to that later on.
426580	429260	ATP is often called the universal energy currency.
429260	431340	In other words, it's powering work.
431340	435020	But that work doesn't have to be making this ATP,
435020	438060	this energy currency, any kind of work.
438060	439820	It can power the bacterial flagella,
439820	442620	which will kind of row a bacterium around the place.
442620	445140	It can power CO2 fixation,
445140	447340	which is what I'll say more about.
447340	451020	OK, so that's how energy works in biology.
451020	452980	That's basically it for all cells.
452980	453980	It's kind of...
453980	456300	There are plenty of variations on that thing,
456300	457780	but this is fundamental.
457780	459860	All life works that way.
459860	460940	It's amazing.
460940	462140	Your own cells work that way,
462140	463260	bacteria work that way,
463260	466380	stuff that you find high up in the atmosphere
466380	467820	on the outside of the space station
467820	470020	or deep down in the bowels of the earth,
470020	471460	in the deep hot biosphere.
471460	473060	It's all working that way.
473060	474220	It's amazing.
474220	478220	It's as universally conserved as the genetic code itself.
478220	481260	OK, this looks exactly the same.
481260	483940	It's not. It's the opposite.
483940	485500	What I'm showing here is this Krebs cycle
485500	487420	going in the opposite direction.
487420	489940	I've still got hydrogen and CO2.
489940	490860	Think what happens though.
490860	493140	Normally when the Krebs cycle is spinning,
493140	495060	it's pulling out hydrogen and CO2
495060	497140	and it's burning the hydrogen in oxygen.
497140	498300	The reverse Krebs cycle,
498300	500380	and quite a lot of bacteria work this way,
500380	502940	is sucking in hydrogen and CO2
502940	505740	and using the energy of this charged membrane
505740	508660	to make them react together to form organic molecules.
508660	509940	The Krebs cycle intermediates.
509940	511900	They're carboxylic acids.
511900	515340	And from then, we make amino acids and sugars
515340	518060	and nucleotide the building blocks of DNA and RNA
518060	520460	and lipids for the membranes themselves and so on.
520460	523260	So it's not about energy only.
523260	525100	It's also about biosynthesis.
525100	528020	It's about making the building blocks of life.
528020	531060	And this is again really deeply conserved in biology.
531060	532860	Some of the molecules in that Krebs cycle,
532860	534940	not necessarily always as a complete cycle,
534940	537620	sometimes more as a linear pathway,
537620	540780	but there are five molecules in there
540780	543860	which are universally conserved across all of life.
543860	547060	They are the universal precursors for all of metabolism.
547060	551380	This is the starting point for making everything that cells do.
551380	553140	And it's all coming from here.
553220	555300	And it's powered by the same system.
555300	556740	It's just operating in reverse.
556740	560900	So it's kind of strange that both metabolism and energy
560900	562380	are powered by the same system.
562380	565260	There's a tension between which way is it going to go.
565260	568340	And in our own bodies, sometimes it's going both ways.
568340	571940	And cancer very often is working with the Krebs cycle
571940	574660	going in the opposite direction, in this reverse direction,
574660	576740	making the building blocks to make new cells
576740	580260	to power the growth of cancer cells.
580260	584060	So that's in a nutshell how metabolism is working.
585420	586660	And genetic information,
586660	589140	I'm going to come back to this in a little more detail later on,
589140	591100	but just what I want you to take now
591100	594060	is that there are patterns in the genetic code
594060	596460	and these have been known about for 60 years
596460	599140	since the early 1960s,
600420	603940	which suggests that there are direct interactions
603940	606820	between the codons,
606820	610620	which is to say that the units within DNA or RNA
610620	613140	that codes for an amino acid in the protein
613140	615260	and the amino acid itself.
615260	617700	In other words, there's a kind of stickiness, you may say.
617700	621060	There are interactions between that particular letter
621060	623660	and that particular amino acid.
623660	626300	And what that suggests is that the genetic code
626300	629100	is not just some random arbitrary assortment,
629100	631740	but that if you had a random string of RNA,
631740	633940	a random string of letters,
634020	637180	then you would have a non-random string of amino acids
637180	640020	that in one way or another, and it may be more like this,
640020	643180	we don't need to specify exactly how that works.
643180	645740	The patterns are there anyway.
645740	648380	What it suggests is that there are direct interactions
648380	651300	between the amino acids and the bases in the genetic code
651300	652820	that code for them.
652820	656620	And so a random RNA sequence codes and non-random peptide,
656620	661220	if that peptide has function in whatever environment it may be,
661220	664180	then natural selection, as we know it, can start.
664180	666900	And there's no mystery about the origin
666900	669620	of information in biology.
671020	674100	So one thing to say about that immediately.
674100	677340	What I'm suggesting here is that we have electricity
677340	680260	driving metabolism, which is giving rise to genes,
680260	682500	and that means it's all going to happen in one place,
682500	684340	and that's already a little bit unnerving
684340	686260	if you're thinking about the origin of life.
686260	689140	Most theories on the origin of life until now have said,
689140	691660	OK, well, this chemistry happens best over here,
691660	694260	and that chemistry works over there, and this works down here,
694260	696500	and we can bring them all together somehow,
696500	699340	and then they will, as I say, congeal into cells
699340	700900	and crawl out of the test tube.
700900	702860	They don't do that.
702860	703740	So what do they do?
703740	709860	Well, in some kind of a place where we've got a continuous reactivity,
709860	712780	continuous gases being brought together,
712780	714420	let's say hydrogen and CO2,
714420	716740	to react together to form these molecules,
716740	720420	forming genes in the same place.
720420	724140	It's a scary hypothesis, but at least it's testable,
724140	725900	and you could say it's very easily testable
725900	729340	because you can do it if you can get the right conditions.
729340	730340	You can do it on a lab bench.
730340	731740	If it's all happening in the same place,
731740	735060	then you can just go straight ahead and test it.
735060	737500	So what kind of place could it possibly be?
737500	740580	Well, the place I favour, it doesn't have to be here,
740580	744660	but this is something that we can get our head around.
744740	747940	I want to know, as alkaline hydrothermal vents.
747940	749620	They were discovered by Deb Kelly,
749620	753780	who was captain of the Alvin submersible back in the year 2000.
753780	756820	Before that, there had been other deep-sea hydrothermal vents
756820	759220	known back into the 1970s,
759220	761660	but these are quite different.
761660	766060	They're not smoking in the way that you'll mostly be familiar,
766060	767820	I'm sure, with the idea of black smokers
767820	770060	with chimney and smoke coming out of the top,
770060	771420	billowing out of the top.
771420	773220	They're not like that. They almost look dead.
773220	774220	They're not dead.
774220	777860	These are living vent systems with fluids going through them.
777860	780620	Deb Kelly here has got a lump of a black smoker
780620	782900	with this chimney structure,
782900	784980	and this is a bit of lost city,
784980	788020	and you might be able to see it looks a bit like a mineralised sponge.
788020	792620	It's kind of a labyrinth of interconnected pores.
792620	796140	And so there are alkaline fluids,
796140	799300	hydrothermal fluids kind of winding their way
799300	802420	through these interconnected pores.
802420	805660	Now, they're not produced by the same mechanism
805660	807860	that makes the black smoke events.
807860	810940	The black smokers are produced by effectively direct interaction
810940	816180	between magma, volcanic magma, and ocean water,
816180	820100	at the spreading centres of the mid-ocean ridges and so on.
820100	823180	What's happening here, we're away from this,
823180	828860	and water will effectively percolate down into the sea floor.
828860	831500	And if the sea floor is relatively close to the mantle,
831580	835740	and this tends to happen these days close to the ridges,
835740	840540	this is 15, 20 kilometres away from the mid-Atlantic ridge,
840540	843580	these green minerals here, it's called olivine.
843580	849340	It's actually the most common mineral in the Earth's mantle.
849340	852660	It's also extremely common in distella space.
852660	855780	It's called olivine just because it looks a bit like olives.
855780	858300	It's really that simple.
858300	862500	Water will percolate down as much as five or six kilometres
862500	865340	underneath the sea floor and react with this olivine,
865340	866900	and it's an exothermic reaction.
866900	871660	It's releasing heat, and it's releasing these alkaline fluids,
871660	874300	so they're warm and they're buoyant and they bubble back up,
874300	877340	and plenty of hydrogen gas.
877340	880860	And it's basically just the oxidation of water that's going on.
880860	884620	Sorry, the oxidation of iron, so ferrous iron is going to ferric iron,
884620	888300	and water is being converted into hydrogen.
888300	893180	These same kind of vents should form on any wet rocky planet,
893180	896220	and they happen on a global scale.
896220	900020	So if this is the mid-Atlantic ridge,
900020	901940	it would be somewhere around here,
901940	904660	we have these reactions going on in the crust,
904660	906900	and then now with tectonic spreading,
906900	911260	it's spreading across the ocean floor and then being subducted down.
911260	914420	In effect, what's happening is the water is reacting with the rock
914420	916140	and hydrating the rock,
916140	918940	and then this hydrated rock is being subducted,
918940	921820	and at the increasing temperatures and pressures,
921820	924020	water is being driven off again.
924020	926580	And that water in the mantle is melting the mantle
926580	928540	and causing convection currents in the mantle,
928540	931460	and that is driving volcanic activity on the planet,
931460	933740	on literally a planetary scale.
933740	936700	So it's then quite interesting that Mars, for example,
936700	938460	which is a fairly small planet,
938460	942660	there's plenty of evidence that it had oceans four billion years ago,
942740	945340	maybe three and a half billion years ago on Mars,
945340	947060	and they disappeared,
947060	949620	and there's various explanations for where they went,
949620	952940	but one interesting explanation is this same process
952940	955940	called serpentinisation,
955940	960260	whereby the minerals like olivine react with water,
960260	961820	get subducted down,
961820	964700	but on a smaller planet which is cooling faster,
964700	968980	the temperatures are cooler now because the core is cooling down,
968980	970540	less of that water is driven off,
970540	975140	and, effectively, Mars buried its oceans as rock,
975140	976540	as hydrated rock,
976540	980540	and that's one of the reasons why Mars, effectively,
980540	982380	seems to have died as a planet.
982380	984220	Maybe there's still life hanging on there,
984220	985500	who knows, we'll find out,
985500	989340	but it would be, to me, quite surprising if there was,
989340	992660	and certainly it's not had any real impact on the atmosphere.
992660	995020	Occasionally we see traces of methane,
995020	1000500	methane could also be produced by this process of serpentinisation.
1000980	1004380	Incidentally, I didn't define serpentinisation,
1004380	1006260	it sounds a bit intimidating.
1006260	1009580	I say minerals like olivine are reacting with water
1009580	1011140	and effectively rusting,
1011140	1014860	and they're being converted into another mineral called serpentinite,
1014860	1016980	and that's the process of serpentinisation,
1016980	1019020	it's a metamorphosis.
1019020	1020820	Why is it called serpentinite?
1020820	1023420	Because it looks like a serpent's scales, again.
1023420	1025620	The geologists have got these intimidating terms
1025620	1028220	that just mean something very simple.
1028300	1031420	We have a rock that looks like olives converted into a rock
1031420	1032980	that looks like serpent's scales,
1032980	1034580	it's called serpentinisation,
1034580	1036060	and it happens throughout the universe.
1036060	1041380	This is Enceladus, which is one of the moons of Saturn,
1041380	1045300	and there are these plumes that were initially seen by Cassini
1045300	1047380	on its fly past of Saturn.
1048500	1053020	And these are alkaline, they're around about pH 9,
1053020	1055020	they're rich in hydrogen and methane,
1055020	1057500	and plenty of organic molecules in there.
1057500	1059340	So, the interpretation of this is,
1059340	1062860	beneath the frozen surface of Enceladus, there is a liquid ocean,
1062860	1065660	and beneath that liquid ocean,
1065660	1071620	there is a rocky, olivine-rich...
1071620	1075140	I don't know what you call it, really, not exactly a mantle,
1075140	1077500	I'm not sure, I'm not a geologist, what the term would be,
1077500	1081620	but anyway, olivine-rich rock underneath the ocean,
1081620	1085020	serpentinising giving rise to this alkaline ocean
1085020	1089660	and the pressure is producing these plumes through cracks in the ice.
1092700	1097500	This idea of planetary scale things going on,
1097500	1100420	this is not a very exact analogy,
1100420	1103100	but it's a very interesting analogy,
1103100	1106260	that the structure of a cell, the topological structure of a cell,
1106260	1110660	and the topological structure of a planet are very similar to each other.
1110660	1112940	So, if this is the Earth, for example,
1112980	1115940	the inside has a negative charge relative to the outside.
1115940	1118940	All of the iron, which is buried down in the core,
1118940	1120380	is effectively electron-rich,
1120380	1124460	whereas the atmosphere, the oceans and so on, are relatively electron-poor.
1124460	1126740	We have gases like carbon dioxide and so on,
1126740	1129220	it's relatively oxidised outside.
1129220	1134580	So, it's also relatively more acidic outside,
1134580	1137020	this is slightly more problematic,
1137020	1142500	but effectively, if you see these as hydrothermal vents
1142500	1144540	between the mantle and the ocean,
1144540	1147020	then we have alkaline fluids coming out,
1147020	1149740	going into a relatively acidic early ocean.
1149740	1151900	Now, a cell structure is basically the same,
1151900	1153540	it's negatively charged inside,
1153540	1159180	it's relatively reduced inside, plenty of electrons and protons on the outside.
1159180	1163900	So, at a slightly hand-wavy level,
1163900	1167860	there is an interesting topological equivalence between planets
1167860	1171620	like the Earth, wet rocky planets, and the structure of cells.
1173500	1175300	This was first noticed,
1175300	1177020	I don't know if it's first noticed,
1177020	1180780	but it was noticed and pointed out by a guy called Mike Russell,
1180780	1182420	30 years ago now,
1182420	1187620	and after the discovery of Lost City by Deb Kelly,
1187620	1191300	his ideas became quite well-known.
1191300	1194380	He predicted the existence of vents like Lost City
1194380	1196220	10 years before their discovery,
1196220	1199860	and his ideas throughout the 90s were pretty marginal in the field,
1199860	1201460	nobody was very interested in them,
1201460	1204300	and you can look back at conference proceedings
1204300	1207140	and see the discussions after people's talks,
1207140	1209020	and there would be Mike Russell jumping up and saying,
1209020	1211020	yeah, but what about alkaline hydrothermal vents,
1211020	1212140	and everybody would ignore him,
1212140	1214900	and it was quite interesting to see this dynamic
1214900	1220580	all written up in volumes of forgotten life sciences history.
1220580	1222420	Then after the discovery of Lost City,
1222420	1224100	he suddenly became much more famous,
1224100	1228420	this was a feature article by Nature in the year 2009,
1228420	1231180	and they photoshopped him up as Erasmus,
1231180	1233300	as the Renaissance man,
1233300	1234860	and they called him Naissance man,
1234860	1237260	Naissance has in the birth of life,
1237260	1238620	and this is his reactor,
1238620	1241460	he was at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
1241460	1244500	and this is a little bit of Lost City behind him,
1244500	1246700	and essentially what he was arguing,
1246700	1250900	and what I still think to be the right way of seeing the question,
1250900	1253620	is that there are high concentrations of hydrogen
1253620	1255580	in these alkaline fluids,
1255580	1257380	bubbling up into the ocean,
1257380	1260980	and the oceans, the early oceans were CO2 rich,
1260980	1262820	it's very hard to constrain how much,
1262820	1266780	but probably as much as one bar of carbon dioxide in those early oceans,
1266780	1270500	they would have been mildly acidic, perhaps pH 5 or 6,
1270500	1276380	and that means this is the sponge-like,
1276380	1278140	mineralised sponge-like structure,
1278140	1281420	all of these interconnected micro pores.
1281420	1283780	Four billion years ago, before there was any oxygen,
1283780	1285740	this is now carbonate rocks,
1285740	1288820	but we would expect to see lots of iron and nickel
1288820	1290620	and transition metals in there as well,
1290620	1292660	because these dissolved in the oceans
1292660	1294540	before there was any oxygen around,
1294540	1296420	especially in acidic oceans.
1296420	1298740	So we would expect to see some of these walls
1298740	1303740	effectively containing catalytic transition metals and equivalents.
1303740	1306220	And so reactive fluids percolating,
1306220	1308700	wending their way through, ocean waters coming in,
1308700	1313380	this is really an electrochemical flow reactor,
1313380	1316140	where we've got the two components that I was saying earlier on,
1316140	1317460	make up the Krebs cycle,
1317460	1321220	are the first starting point for life hydrogen and CO2
1321220	1325460	being forcibly reacted together with natural proton gradients,
1325460	1328180	which is to say differences in the proton concentration
1328180	1330740	between the ocean waters and the alkaline fluids,
1330740	1332660	probably across these barriers,
1332660	1335100	across potentially quite short distances.
1335100	1336340	So we've got a system here,
1336340	1339420	which has a structure which is reminiscent of cells,
1339420	1341620	and we've got all the right ingredients
1341620	1345980	to be reacting together to make the components of cells.
1346060	1347820	So at least you can imagine
1347820	1354020	that this may be a suitable starting point for life.
1354020	1357900	So this is my hypothesis,
1357900	1359620	which is grounded in the work of the people
1359620	1361100	that I've been talking about,
1361100	1363780	but I'm not sure any of them would necessarily see it quite this way,
1363780	1366340	and I wouldn't have dared to show anybody this slide
1366340	1368220	even five or six years ago.
1368220	1371940	It's very simple, and I'll explain it briefly,
1371940	1374380	but I wouldn't have dared to say it
1374380	1377980	because there's big claims going on here,
1377980	1381420	and they're experimentally tractable questions,
1381420	1383420	and the reason I dare to show it to you now
1383420	1385980	is that a lot of them are beginning to show signs
1385980	1387380	that there's truth in them.
1387380	1389020	So imagine this is a paw
1389020	1390380	in one of these hydrothermal vents.
1390380	1393060	We've got acidic ocean waters percolating in.
1393060	1396860	We've got iron sulfur minerals in these barriers,
1396860	1399940	not just that, or silicate and carbonate and things as well,
1399940	1401980	but some iron sulfur minerals,
1401980	1404660	driving a reaction between hydrogen and CO2,
1404660	1406620	not necessarily a complete Krebs cycle,
1406620	1409740	but at least some of these intermediates in the Krebs cycle,
1409740	1412060	to make the most thermodynamically-favoured products.
1412060	1415140	Lipids, which is to say fatty acids,
1415140	1419980	long-chain hydrocarbons, and amino acids.
1419980	1425140	These are the two most thermodynamically-favoured groups.
1425140	1428380	If we did make lipids, we potentially would expect
1428460	1430380	that they would form some kind of a...
1430380	1432980	I'm going to call it a proto-cell.
1432980	1436580	It's got a bilayer membrane around it, and it's snuggling in.
1436580	1439220	I'm showing it deliberately snuggling into a paw here.
1439220	1442140	I'm exaggerating, but this, effectively,
1442140	1445140	this paw is templating a cell,
1445140	1448420	and the cell is snuggling in with a bilayer membrane around it,
1448420	1451340	and now it's a semi-closed system, and we can make more things,
1451340	1455420	not just lipids and amino acids, but also sugars, maybe nucleotides.
1455420	1459540	For this to be happening, we need that bit.
1459540	1462500	This iron-sulfur mineral.
1462500	1465500	Well, if we want to be fixing these things inside a proto-cell,
1465500	1468340	then this needs to be sticking in this membrane.
1468340	1470660	Protons need to be crossing that membrane.
1470660	1474100	We need to have all this happening inside, and a continuous flow.
1474100	1476220	So we're combining the structure of the vent
1476220	1478940	with the continuous flow of things.
1478940	1482500	And this, I hope, will be beginning to challenge you,
1482540	1484620	because, certainly, I would be thinking,
1484620	1488140	well, really, can we really believe that that's true?
1488140	1490460	And then, just as a final challenge,
1490460	1492860	if we can get as far as nucleotides,
1492860	1495300	then we can begin to have RNA.
1495300	1497580	We can begin to have a kind of an RNA world,
1497580	1501020	but inside these growing proto-cells,
1501020	1503220	and now we've got amino acids becoming peptides,
1503220	1505580	we've got RNA,
1505580	1509300	which is the kind of more reactive equivalent of DNA
1509300	1512260	if you're not so familiar with these things.
1512260	1514580	And the beginnings of making proteins,
1514580	1515900	the beginnings of information,
1515900	1519660	and the beginnings of real protein function in cells.
1519660	1521780	So it's a very simple hypothesis,
1521780	1525540	and it really challenges our ability
1525540	1528260	to believe our own hypotheses in science,
1528260	1532980	but the good thing is it is eminently testable.
1532980	1534220	So I'm going to run through,
1534220	1536820	and I'm going to show you a little bit of data with some of this,
1536820	1538460	and I kind of apologise for that
1538460	1540020	because it's not supposed to be a seminar,
1540020	1542660	but at the same time, if I just stand here and wave my arms around
1542660	1545260	and say, yeah, take it from me, it's really going to happen,
1545260	1546780	you really should not believe me.
1546780	1549260	So I'm going to show you that we can do some experiments,
1549260	1551980	that this is actually science,
1551980	1554860	and I'll show you the kind of experiments that we can do.
1554860	1556660	I'm going to skim over them quite lightly,
1556660	1559380	and if you've got questions, feel free to either interrupt
1559380	1563500	and ask as I'm going along, or ask at the end.
1563500	1568220	Anyway, so this idea that life is powered by electric membranes,
1568220	1571820	it goes back to 1961,
1571820	1575180	to a paper from Peter Mitchell in 1961
1575180	1577980	on what he called the chemiosmotic hypothesis,
1577980	1581380	and this is an older picture, and it's with Jennifer Moyle,
1581380	1587020	and Jennifer Moyle, she was working with Mitchell from 1947,
1587020	1589260	this is 1947 in Cambridge,
1589260	1592380	and she was a brilliant experimentalist,
1592380	1596060	and most of the good papers that they wrote together in the 1960s
1596060	1597380	on the chemiosmotic hypothesis
1597460	1600100	is the best papers were Mitchell and Moyle together,
1600100	1602700	and she did all the experimental work.
1602700	1604940	Mitchell was a brilliant theoretician,
1604940	1606740	he was cac-handed in the lab,
1606740	1608340	he could never finish an experiment,
1608340	1610940	it was Moyle that really did the experimental work,
1610940	1613940	and Mitchell, of course, perhaps you don't know,
1613940	1619220	but Mitchell in 1978 was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry by himself,
1619220	1620900	I'm increasingly thinking,
1620900	1624340	and I've been kind of digging around in the literature,
1624420	1627580	but I think now, if that were to happen,
1627580	1629540	then Moyle would have won the Nobel Prize with him,
1629540	1631740	I think luckily times are changing,
1631740	1634660	but I think that was a miscarriage of justice.
1634660	1639540	Anyway, before this hypothesis was first published in 1961,
1639540	1643100	Mitchell was a conference in Moscow, 1957,
1643100	1645740	on the origin of life, it was organised by Oparin,
1645740	1651220	who was a great Soviet, I suppose he was a chemist,
1651220	1653060	interested in the origin of life,
1653060	1655940	and a lot of the great scientists in the world at the time,
1655940	1658500	so people like J.V.S. Haldane was there,
1659620	1663460	and Mitchell himself was there as well,
1663460	1665380	and J.D. Bernal was there,
1665380	1666420	a lot of them were communists,
1666420	1669780	which was why they went to Moscow and why they were interested,
1669780	1675060	but it's also interesting that because there's such a materialistic basis
1675060	1677740	to Marxism and communism,
1677740	1680900	they were interested in questions like the origin of life
1680900	1682740	in a way that many other people weren't at the time,
1682740	1685700	so there's a reason why it was happening in Moscow.
1686900	1692580	Mitchell really was not a communist really at all,
1693460	1695500	in fact, he was from a very wealthy family,
1695500	1698940	and he used to drive a silver Rolls Royce around Cambridge
1698940	1700700	during the war time,
1701420	1704980	and this is quite a poetic view here,
1704980	1708140	I love this quote because it's eye-opening
1708140	1709580	when you think about the origin of life,
1709580	1713340	he says, I cannot consider the organism without its environment.
1713340	1714300	From a formal point of view,
1714300	1717420	the two may be regarded as equivalent phases
1717420	1719580	between which dynamic contact is maintained
1719580	1722180	by the membranes that separate and link them.
1723580	1727900	So the inside of a cell in the outside world are equivalent phases.
1727900	1731420	He's not separating life out and saying this is what life is
1731420	1732620	and this is what the environment is,
1732620	1733780	he's conflating them,
1733780	1736460	he's saying they're equivalent to each other,
1736460	1737940	which is a strange thing to say,
1737940	1739300	but if you're thinking about the origin of life
1739300	1741980	before there is such a thing as a cell that we would recognise,
1741980	1744980	before there is really an organism or a living system,
1744980	1746860	thinking about phases as your equivalent
1746860	1749460	separated and joined by a membrane
1749460	1752060	is a very productive way of thinking about the question.
1753700	1756420	And this is, to my mind,
1756420	1758780	what we have in a hydrothermal vent,
1758780	1760460	we have a barrier,
1760460	1763540	and we have alkaline hydrothermal fluids inside,
1763540	1766060	and we have acidic ocean waters on the outside,
1766140	1768940	and so the topology is equivalent to a bacterial cell.
1768940	1770060	Here's a bacterial cell.
1770060	1772300	We're pumping out protons,
1772300	1774580	and so it's relatively acidic on the outside
1774580	1776420	and it's relatively alkaline on the inside,
1776420	1779860	and potentially it's three pH units difference
1779860	1781220	between the inside and the outside.
1781220	1786140	So it's the same magnitude and it's the same topology as a cell.
1786140	1789980	So is there any way that we can kind of go from here to there?
1789980	1791180	The other thing to notice about this,
1791180	1794740	we're pumping out protons all the time in our own body,
1794740	1796540	but why?
1796540	1799620	Because we're putting them to work, to power work,
1799620	1802100	and so the influx of protons is driving work,
1802100	1804340	and the influx of protons across here
1804340	1806540	could potentially drive work as well.
1808100	1810060	What kind of work could it potentially do?
1810060	1813380	Before there are any enzymes, any genes,
1813380	1816180	any kind of structures that you would think
1816180	1818300	could do anything useful,
1818300	1819780	what on earth could it actually do?
1819780	1822100	Well, there is a simple answer,
1822100	1825660	and it's basically about driving growth.
1825660	1827140	Why would that happen?
1827140	1829260	The problem with hydrogen and CO2
1829260	1831420	is they're just not very reactive.
1831420	1834500	The first couple of steps to get them to react
1834500	1835820	is really difficult,
1835820	1838180	and so if you were to just take a mixture of gases,
1838180	1840100	hydrogen and CO2, and put them in a test tube
1840100	1841500	and heat them up to say 50 degrees
1841500	1843620	and shake them up for half a billion years,
1843620	1846100	nothing much is really going to happen.
1846100	1849300	Actually, thermodynamically, you should get cells.
1849300	1850660	Incredibly, you should get cells.
1850660	1853100	They are more thermodynamically favored
1853100	1856060	than just a mixture of hydrogen and CO2.
1856060	1858500	The problem is this first couple of steps
1858500	1861220	to get to formaldehyde is uphill.
1861220	1865700	We don't need to go into the details of redox chemistry.
1865700	1867860	All you really need to notice is it's uphill
1867860	1870460	and it's quite steeply uphill to get them to react.
1870460	1873260	But that is at the same pH.
1873260	1875220	What we actually have in a hydrothermal vent
1875220	1877860	is the alkaline fluids at pH 11
1877860	1881700	and the acidic ocean waters, let's say pH 6.
1881700	1884140	And now you can see it's downhill.
1884140	1885700	Why is it downhill?
1885700	1888660	It's quite simple, again, intuitively to understand.
1888660	1890420	If you imagine hydrogen gas,
1890420	1893060	it wants to pass its electrons onto something else.
1893060	1895300	That leaves behind the protons,
1895300	1897740	and the protons, well, that's what makes an acid.
1897740	1901980	So an acid is rich in protons.
1901980	1904860	If you make those protons in an alkaline environment,
1904860	1907220	they'll immediately react with hydroxide to form water.
1907220	1908620	It's a neutralisation reaction.
1908620	1911820	It's extremely rapid, it's thermodynamically favoured.
1911820	1915140	It's going to happen instantaneously and release a lot of heat.
1915140	1917020	So it's just a neutralisation.
1917020	1919700	If you try to release protons in an acidic environment,
1919700	1921380	well, you're making an acid more acid,
1921380	1924940	that's not really favoured in terms of chemistry.
1924940	1927300	So it's going to be much more reactive
1927300	1928740	in an alkaline environment.
1928740	1931020	And CO2, well, it picks up an electron,
1931020	1932460	now it's got a negative charge.
1932460	1933860	If it's in an acidic environment,
1933860	1935180	it can pick up a proton now.
1935180	1937420	It's balanced the charges now, another electron now,
1937420	1939900	another proton, and off we go, we can make it.
1939900	1942140	So it becomes easier.
1942140	1945820	CO2 becomes more reactive in an acidic environment.
1945820	1948500	And so its downhill is going to happen
1948500	1952900	so long as we have hydrogen in one phase at pH 11
1952900	1955660	and CO2 in a different phase at pH 6,
1955660	1957980	and they're not constantly mixing.
1957980	1961140	They're not just forming the same thing.
1961140	1963740	So that's what we have in these vents.
1963740	1965380	And this is a fairly simple experiment.
1965380	1967020	Actually, we've been building reactors
1967020	1969180	and trying to make these things react for quite a long time
1969180	1970780	and embarrassingly long time.
1970780	1972060	And it's got smaller and smaller
1972060	1973380	and more and more controllable.
1973380	1975780	And this is a microfluidic chip.
1975780	1977380	You can see it there as well.
1977380	1981220	Inside this anaerobic glove box.
1981220	1987420	And we have parallel flow, acidic flow with iron chloride
1987420	1989380	and alkaline flow with sodium sulfide.
1989380	1992460	And it precipitates this very thin barrier.
1992540	1995220	And what we're hoping is that protons or maybe electrons
1995220	1998060	when still not sure which, unbelievably,
1998060	2001340	will cross this barrier and reduce CO2
2001340	2003500	to make organic molecules.
2003500	2004300	Does it work?
2004300	2005260	Well, yes it does.
2005260	2009620	It's not hugely impressive, I have to admit.
2009620	2011620	It's taken a long time even to get to this.
2011620	2015500	This is the kind of thing, if you're not a scientist,
2015500	2018460	then maybe this will help you understand.
2018460	2022140	People get amazingly excited about that.
2022140	2024380	That is formate.
2024380	2027020	Which is to say, it's the very first step
2027020	2028740	of reacting hydrogen and CO2
2028740	2031620	to make the very first product.
2031620	2033780	So it's a step in the right direction.
2033780	2036620	And it's sticking up quite a long way above this baseline.
2036620	2039300	Sometimes this baseline is quite lumpy and bumpy
2039300	2041980	and so this is not a bad peak really.
2041980	2046580	And so it's proof that it can begin to happen.
2046580	2052660	And over here, this one is acetate,
2052660	2054700	which is two carbons joined together.
2054700	2056540	And we've managed to get three carbons joined together
2056540	2060220	and you'll probably be thinking, wow, well done.
2060220	2064420	But it's taken us 10 years.
2064420	2066940	It's a bit embarrassing, as I say.
2066940	2069700	Other people have gone much further
2069700	2071860	but they've very often used higher pressures
2071860	2074220	and all kinds of interesting minerals.
2074220	2076180	This is with very freshly precipitated
2076180	2077300	with just a pH gradient.
2077300	2079380	And if you cut out the pH gradient,
2079380	2081140	it doesn't work, you don't get anything.
2081140	2083580	If you cut out some of the transition metals like nickel,
2083580	2084940	it doesn't work, you don't get anything.
2084940	2089340	So even though it looks incredibly cheap,
2089340	2091380	it is actually quite exciting.
2091380	2094420	It's a proof of concept that a pH gradient across a barrier
2094420	2098540	will drive CO2 fixation and make the organic molecules.
2098540	2101580	And notice acetate, it's actually one of the Krebs cycle.
2101580	2103900	And the reverse Krebs cycle is one of the intermediates,
2103900	2108420	one of the universally conserved intermediates.
2108420	2111340	Now, I said other people have done more than we have.
2111340	2113140	We're now talking higher temperatures
2113140	2114780	and higher pressures and things like that.
2114780	2118980	But some people have produced longer chain fatty acids
2118980	2121100	doing that.
2121100	2124260	And they'd done that 20 years ago, actually,
2124260	2125980	not using pH gradients.
2125980	2129140	And we'd taken a selection of these and tried to see,
2129140	2131700	well, if you remember my picture,
2131700	2137700	I was showing you a proto cell nestling snugly inside a pore.
2137700	2139340	Well, that requires a bilayer membrane,
2139340	2141180	and that requires something really simple.
2141180	2143700	And so the question is, if we take these fatty acids that
2143700	2146820	have been made and something called fatty alcohols, which
2146820	2149540	also is kind of a long chain of covens joined together
2149540	2152060	with an alcohol group stuck on the end,
2152060	2153740	do we get things that look like proto cells?
2153740	2156980	And the answer is yes, this is cryoelectron microscopy,
2156980	2159820	and it's got a bilayer membrane around an aqueous space
2159820	2161420	inside these similar things.
2161420	2167460	This is confocal microscopy, and I think this one is at pH 7,
2167460	2170540	but this one's at pH 12, and these are also at pH 12.
2170540	2173780	So we are able to make them, and they
2173780	2177780	make stable proto cells quite beautiful to look at.
2177780	2179820	When you see them live, as it were,
2179820	2182020	they're moving around and doing interesting things.
2182020	2184580	They're quite dynamic.
2184580	2188660	So yes, and the question there was, well,
2188660	2191940	are they stable in these harsh conditions in a hydrothermal vent
2191940	2196420	at 70 degrees centigrade and pH 9 or 10 or 11,
2196420	2200900	and lots of salt and calcium and magnesium and all the rest of it?
2200900	2203420	And the answer is yes, that has all of those things in.
2203420	2208940	So it is quite easy to make them, it turns out.
2208940	2212300	And this, I'm not going to go through the details here,
2212300	2216060	but this is another thing where scientists get ridiculously
2216060	2220980	excited about, let's say, that, this little shoulder here.
2220980	2223820	This is what's called UV-viz spectroscopy,
2223820	2228860	and that shoulder is diagnostic of what are called 4FE4S clusters,
2228860	2232860	which is a kind of little cube of iron and sulfur.
2232860	2235020	And they're found in some of the most important proteins
2235020	2237300	in biology, things like ferrodoxin, which
2237300	2241740	are directly doing CO2 fixation in pretty much all cells.
2241740	2245140	These are ancient proteins, and they always contain these little cubes
2245140	2249020	of iron and sulfur, and they're like minerals.
2249020	2251700	And actually, they're formed in the same way as minerals,
2251700	2252900	they form spontaneously.
2252900	2255020	And so this is the kind of the machinery,
2255020	2257700	this is the most simple machinery you could imagine for CO2
2257700	2260740	fixation, which is becoming biology.
2260740	2263460	And they have a diagnostic shoulder on UV-viz spectroscopy.
2263460	2265780	So as soon as you see this, you think, whoa,
2265780	2271980	we expected that we would mix iron chloride and sodium sulfide
2271980	2276140	and cystin, the amino acid cystin, at pH 9, and we mix it up.
2276140	2281540	And what I thought we would see would be smaller crystals, big things,
2281540	2284780	but getting smaller coated in cystin.
2284780	2286740	That's kind of what I expected to see.
2286740	2289220	I didn't expect to see that.
2289220	2292820	Suddenly, we've gone from when you do it without the cystin,
2292820	2294260	everything goes black.
2294260	2298220	You just form the mineral, you just form iron sulfide minerals,
2298220	2299860	and everything goes black.
2299860	2302740	And when we first started doing these experiments quite a while ago
2302740	2306780	now, the first PhD student I had,
2306780	2308980	she became terribly depressed in the first month or two
2308980	2311740	because every experiment just went black every time.
2311740	2314540	It was nothing, it took a long time to figure out
2314540	2317500	we need alkaline pH, and we need all the, you know.
2317500	2320500	So surprisingly, again, surprisingly long time,
2320500	2323220	and eventually we get through to forming these,
2323220	2326020	it depends on the amount of cystin that you have,
2326020	2327660	it depends on the concentration of iron,
2327660	2330300	and I won't go through the details of these.
2330300	2332500	Here's what these little clusters look like.
2332500	2334620	That is this that I showed you.
2334620	2337980	This is from my original slide that I showed you.
2337980	2341140	So what I'm saying is it's quite easy to make
2341140	2342820	the bilayer membrane surrounding it,
2342820	2347620	and it's quite easy to make these little clusters of iron and sulfide
2347620	2350180	that are doing CO2 fixation in modern cells.
2350180	2353060	They have exactly the same chemistry.
2353060	2355180	And they will fix CO2.
2355180	2356860	This is formate, and this is acetate,
2356860	2358580	and again, I won't go through the details,
2358580	2361060	but the green one here is just pure water.
2361060	2363100	This is done on an electrode,
2363100	2365380	so there is an electrical potential here as well,
2365380	2368260	but when we have the clusters, we get an awful lot more
2368260	2371020	than you get in the absence of the clusters.
2371020	2372300	So again, it does work.
2372300	2376740	We can effectively build this machinery that life uses
2376740	2379260	with the most simple imaginable ingredients.
2380380	2383900	Okay, so that's effectively turning gases
2383900	2387020	into the core molecules of life.
2387020	2388620	What happens next?
2388620	2390340	Well, metabolism.
2390340	2393140	This is a tube map of metabolism,
2393140	2395460	the kind of London underground.
2395460	2399700	The remarkable thing about it is that this basic topology
2399700	2402700	is again, it's conserved across all of life.
2402700	2404180	You don't need to worry about the details,
2404180	2407140	but that kind of map, it's like,
2407140	2409980	imagine that you go to Paris
2409980	2412620	and you look at the underground map in Paris
2412620	2414220	and you find it's exactly the same
2414220	2416220	as the underground map in London.
2416220	2418220	And you go to New York,
2418220	2420900	and it's exactly, it's not the same conceptory.
2420900	2422780	It's got the same stations.
2422780	2423620	It's incredible.
2423620	2425460	Everything is exactly the same.
2425460	2426980	What's happening down these is,
2426980	2429580	not as if you've just got some kind of flow going down.
2429580	2432300	What's really happening is each of these molecules
2432300	2434900	is converting into another molecule.
2434900	2437860	So this is the kind of the line going from pyruvate
2437860	2441020	through to valine, for example, or to alanine.
2441980	2446020	These are molecules being converted into other things.
2446020	2450460	So it's not very equivalent to a tube map in that sense,
2450460	2456340	but it's remarkable that the genes that code for this map,
2456340	2458300	they're not the same.
2458300	2459900	I mean, some of them are the same,
2459900	2461860	but most of them are different in, for example,
2461860	2465900	bacteria and archaea, two of the domains of life.
2465900	2469140	And what that suggests is that this tube map
2469460	2472020	is actually older than the genes.
2472020	2474220	Now, again, that's something of an assertion,
2474220	2476180	but what it suggests then is that a lot of it
2476180	2477380	should happen spontaneously,
2477380	2480140	that we should be able to just do this chemistry in the lab
2480140	2482340	without there being any enzymes there,
2482340	2483700	any genetic programming there,
2483700	2486500	nothing which should just happen spontaneously
2486500	2487820	in the right environment.
2488740	2491020	And this is just one example showing more or less that.
2491020	2493100	We're starting with, let me just go back a moment,
2493100	2496420	oxaloacetate, which is here, so we're just feeding it this.
2497260	2498940	And we're looking to see if we get a spartate.
2498940	2500420	This is a very difficult reaction
2500420	2502900	and has never been done before.
2502900	2504460	And what we're also seeing,
2504460	2507260	we're seeing alanine and pyruvate and glycine and serine.
2507260	2510420	So this is alanine.
2510420	2512500	These are different metal ions that we're using,
2512500	2514900	so I won't spend much time on the details.
2514900	2517260	We're getting not large amounts,
2517260	2521540	but hundreds of micro molar with copper and with ferric iron,
2521540	2522860	but nothing with those.
2522860	2524020	A spartate is quite hard,
2524020	2526340	but some metal ions do the job.
2526340	2529460	But we're also getting glycine and serine and alanine.
2530420	2532460	And this was on GCMS.
2532460	2534260	This is just what we measured,
2534260	2538060	which means that we've got this flow going through this system.
2538060	2539780	And it's not coming out with other things.
2539780	2542220	We are, it's like the train is following the lines
2542220	2544140	even in the absence of any gene.
2544140	2545900	So it's not much, but it's there.
2545900	2549420	And we've also got through as far as cysteine, for example,
2549420	2551700	so all the way through to here,
2551700	2555340	which is what's binding those iron sulfur clusters.
2555340	2556780	So this is early days.
2556780	2558700	There's another group in Strasbourg
2558700	2561420	who's done more of this kind of work than we have.
2561420	2564220	They've managed to do pretty much all of the Krebs cycle,
2564220	2566620	pretty much most of this pathway coming down here.
2566620	2569660	And now we've also done sugar synthesis
2569660	2572020	coming through to ribose and so on.
2572020	2574100	A lot of this map has been done in the lab
2574100	2578140	in the last 10 years, since 2015, eight years.
2579220	2580220	And it works.
2580220	2582100	Not everyone's done it under the same conditions.
2582100	2584260	It's not as if we start here and just go whoosh
2584260	2586140	right the way through this whole system.
2586140	2589060	One group does this little bit, another group does that bit,
2589060	2590980	someone else does this bit.
2590980	2594140	But it's interesting that piecing it together,
2594140	2596060	it seems to be spontaneous chemistry.
2596060	2598780	It's a lot harder to try and get flow going through
2598780	2601900	the entire system that could date years,
2601900	2603420	possibly decades, who knows.
2603420	2606660	But at least it begins to give you a little faith,
2606660	2610420	I would say, that this kind of chemistry is really possible.
2610420	2612420	Think about the earlier four billion years ago.
2612420	2617140	We've got an entire planet covered in hydrothermal vents,
2617140	2618580	covered in these hydrothermal systems.
2618580	2620980	There was no distinction between the crust and the mantle
2620980	2624220	at that time, so these vent systems were everywhere.
2624220	2626260	And how many million years do you want?
2626260	2630780	So the idea that in the scope of a PhD thesis
2630780	2633820	on a bench top in a small lab,
2633820	2636020	which is always struggling to get funded,
2636020	2637820	that we can make all of this stuff happen,
2637820	2639540	of course it's not going to happen.
2639540	2642260	If we can get anything to happen at all,
2642260	2643340	it's a step in the direction.
2643340	2646460	So I think again, to return to my point at the beginning,
2646460	2648500	intellectually we're beginning to get a feel
2648500	2651900	for how this kind of chemistry might work out.
2651900	2654100	And we're beginning to do the experiments
2654100	2656260	that suggest that it's not completely impossible.
2656260	2658180	It's not utterly improbable.
2659380	2661980	This was showing that we can make uracil,
2661980	2664780	which is one of the letters in RNA and DNA.
2664780	2666180	This is not too many steps,
2666180	2668500	but we start with ammonia and carbonate and aspartate,
2668500	2670180	and we can go right the way through there.
2670260	2673460	This is uracil and oratate as a one-pot synthesis.
2673460	2676140	And when we optimize the conditions,
2676140	2678100	we got about 10 times as much uracil,
2678100	2680860	just in these last three steps here.
2680860	2683940	And interestingly, those conditions turned out to be
2683940	2686780	90 degrees centigrade, pH 8.5,
2686780	2689860	one molar sodium chloride.
2689860	2692740	So quite similar to alkaline hydrothermal vents.
2692740	2695460	So again, this is just showing that whole pathways
2695460	2697860	can spontaneously happen.
2697860	2698980	And this is an interesting one.
2698980	2701020	This is ATP that I mentioned at the beginning.
2701020	2704820	These days, it's made by this astonishing rotating motor,
2704820	2709220	the ATP synthase, which is the membrane here.
2709220	2713220	It's got this literally rotating motor and it's making ATP.
2713220	2717860	It's one of the most magical molecular machines.
2717860	2719620	It's just beautiful.
2719620	2720460	And it's rotating.
2720460	2723700	This is not really rotating slowly like that.
2723700	2727620	It's going 200 times revolutions a second,
2727620	2729380	up to 500 revolutions a second.
2729380	2732020	It's extraordinary fast.
2732020	2735220	And it's just phosphorylating ATP to ATP.
2735220	2738700	So it's adding a phosphate group on to ADP.
2738700	2741140	And it's been a big question,
2741140	2743420	how do we make ATP then in the absence
2743420	2744900	of a sophisticated protein like that?
2744900	2746300	There are ways of doing it.
2746300	2748420	But here's, this is just showing again,
2748420	2753540	with peric iron and water and two-carbon acetyl phosphate,
2753540	2757180	we get about 15% to 20% yield of ATP.
2757180	2760860	It varies depending on the temperature.
2760860	2763860	Most metal ions didn't work, only peric iron worked.
2763860	2767140	And we could do it with ATP, but not with the other bases.
2767140	2769980	So why is it the universal energy currency in part
2769980	2773580	because you can make it in water with peric iron as a catalyst
2773580	2777220	and acetyl phosphate as a phosphate donor?
2777220	2778580	So it's prebiotic chemistry.
2778580	2781580	It works and you get specifically ATP.
2781580	2784020	We're not synthesizing ATP all the steps.
2784020	2785900	This is just the last bit of phosphorylating,
2785900	2788420	but it's interesting that it works.
2788420	2791020	Okay, information.
2791020	2792780	And keep an eye on the time.
2792780	2793740	I'm going a little slow.
2793740	2795180	Are you all right?
2795180	2798580	Should we have a music break?
2798580	2799740	I'll keep going for now.
2799740	2802940	So information.
2802940	2804660	This is kind of what you've seen already.
2804660	2806460	This is the pattern of metabolism.
2806460	2807780	I'm talking about pyruvate.
2807780	2809820	These are the Krebs cycle intermediates up here.
2809820	2810820	And it's color coded.
2810820	2812700	These are all amino acids.
2812780	2818980	And in gray, they all have a G at the first position of the codon.
2818980	2826180	So in DNA and RNA, each amino acid is encoded by three letters.
2826180	2827460	It's called a codon.
2827460	2833220	And those three letters in the first one for glycine
2833220	2836100	is always a G and so on.
2836100	2840780	This is when the first letter is an A for adenosine.
2840780	2843700	In blue, it's encoded by cytidine.
2843700	2847980	And in green, it's by a U.
2847980	2849580	And you can see immediately looking at that,
2849580	2852020	that there's some interesting structure there.
2852020	2857020	That it looks as if the G is very close to CO2 fixation
2857020	2860580	and the blue ones are much further away.
2860580	2861820	And that is indeed the case.
2861820	2863340	We see a kind of correlation.
2863340	2868580	It's a reasonable correlation, not perfect, but this is the number of steps
2868580	2870700	from CO2 to the amino acid.
2870700	2873620	And it's the shorter distance from G to U.
2873620	2877380	The outlier down here is cysteine, which is that one,
2877380	2884180	which we have reasons why we can explain why that's an outlier, we think.
2884180	2887020	That's the first position of the codon.
2887020	2889700	If we organize this by the first position of the codon,
2889700	2893780	so a G or an A at that first position or a C or a U,
2893780	2897300	this is the second position of the anticodon.
2897620	2900820	And this is the hydrophobicity.
2900820	2906580	And so the V is valine, it's a very hydrophobic amino acid.
2906580	2910940	And it's encoded, the colors changed here, unfortunately, this is now an A.
2910940	2916340	So valine is encoded at the second position of the anticodon by an A,
2916340	2919260	which is the most hydrophobic base.
2919260	2922380	So we have effectively the most hydrophobic base encodes,
2922380	2924380	the most hydrophobic amino acid.
2924460	2927380	And here we have a spartate, and it's encoded by a U,
2927380	2932100	which is the most hydrophilic amino acid encoded by the most hydrophilic base.
2932100	2937980	So we see this relationship between how much water-loving or water-hating they are.
2937980	2941300	It suggests they're snuggling up to each other in some way.
2942460	2946660	It's less strong if we're further away, if we're looking at C and U,
2946660	2950380	so these were the ones that were further away at the first position.
2950380	2952620	There is a relationship, but it's not very impressive.
2952620	2956380	But these first two, it really does look as if there are direct interactions
2956380	2959660	between amino acids and the bases that code for them.
2959660	2965220	And this is a third position, and this is what's called an inverted codon table.
2965220	2968700	So first of all, most people would think that the third position
2968700	2970940	is usually just thought of as redundant.
2970940	2974540	There's not much information in that third position.
2974540	2977260	So where it's white, it is redundant.
2977260	2980940	There can be more than one amino acid encoded there.
2980980	2984860	But where it's coloured, these are not redundant.
2984860	2987980	It's a single amino acid is encoded by that.
2987980	2991460	So you can see immediately that it's not a random patterning.
2991460	2995380	The redundancy itself is not random in the genetic code.
2995380	2998580	And if I just consider one example, so this is glutamate,
2998580	3002300	and it's the same colour as a spartate over here,
3002300	3005180	they've both got a G at the first position of the codon,
3005180	3008220	they've both got an A at the second position of the codon,
3008220	3012940	but this glutamate has a purine, and a spartate has a pyrimidine.
3012940	3015100	Now, pyrimidines have got two rings, they're bigger.
3015100	3017620	Pyrimidines have got a single ring, they're smaller.
3017620	3020300	And it corresponds to the size of the amino acid.
3020300	3026100	So we can predict most of the code on the basis of these interactions.
3026100	3028820	It's kind of circular, we're predicting the code from patterns
3028820	3032780	that are inside the code anyway, so there's some problem here.
3032780	3034620	But we can also test these things,
3034620	3040140	and we've done molecular dynamic simulations and NMR.
3040140	3042060	And I'll just give one example here.
3042060	3044540	So this is the amino acid proline,
3044540	3046700	and we're looking to see how much time does it spend
3046700	3050900	close to each of these bases A, C, G or U,
3050900	3054140	and within about two angstroms, so really snuggling up,
3054140	3056580	it's spending a lot of time with a G,
3056580	3059700	and it's not spending so much time with the other bases.
3059700	3063980	G is the one that encodes it at the second position of the anticodon.
3064060	3066340	For arginine, we also get it correct,
3066340	3069780	but there's a lot of overlap here, so it's kind of weak and statistical,
3069780	3076180	but we can predict about 50% of the code on these interactions.
3076180	3082100	And it's interesting, this is the one, so here, for example,
3082100	3088980	with proline, we think that it should be with a G, and that's here.
3088980	3093820	So we think G first, and then so this is the second guess,
3093820	3096100	this is the third one, and this is the worst one.
3096100	3099220	And I've put a ring around the correct base,
3099220	3101900	and they're organised according to a hydrophobicity.
3101900	3104700	So these things are very hydrophobic, these things are very hydrophilic,
3104700	3108700	and we get 50% correct, but they're all the hydrophilic end.
3108700	3111940	At the hydrophobic end, we don't do very well.
3111940	3115900	So this molecular dynamic simulations,
3115900	3118700	I'm not really a proper chemist,
3118700	3121420	it's all about the forces between atoms,
3121420	3125100	and how strong are hydrophobic interactions,
3125100	3126780	or how strong is charge interactions,
3126780	3129180	over what distance does it operate, and so on.
3129180	3131020	And they're a little bit clunky,
3131020	3134900	and they don't seem to be very good at these hydrophobic ones.
3134900	3136460	We did that with two different programmes,
3136460	3138100	and we got the same results, more or less.
3138100	3140540	And we got the same thing with NMR as well.
3140540	3142900	NMR also has a problem with hydrophobicity,
3142900	3145740	because you can't dissolve hydrophobic amino acids in water
3145740	3147580	at a high concentration, or the bases,
3147580	3149540	and so you don't have a good signal.
3149540	3150860	So it's very messy.
3150860	3153180	It's funny, this is chemistry that people have been doing
3153180	3156060	over decades, and it's still messy.
3156060	3158900	But there is a pattern,
3158900	3160980	and it seems to be supported by the data,
3160980	3164500	and that can explain the origins of information in biology.
3164500	3167060	This is a summary slide of everything I've said, really.
3167060	3169380	We've got a proton gradient across a membrane,
3169380	3171780	driving the reaction between hydrogen and CO2,
3171780	3175180	going into a proto metabolism, making amino acids,
3175180	3176660	and nucleotides.
3176660	3179420	We're polymerising the nucleotides to make RNA,
3179420	3183620	polymerising the amino acids to make peptides.
3183620	3186380	We have stereochemical interactions between them.
3186380	3189180	We've got something like translation going on here,
3189180	3190300	making these things,
3190300	3193180	and we have all kinds of positive feedback loops
3193180	3194740	interacting there,
3194740	3197100	which can make this system increase.
3197100	3198620	I'm not going to go through the details of this,
3198620	3200460	but we can imagine very simple ways
3200460	3202180	in which these amino acids can interact
3202180	3206020	with very small aptomers of RNA.
3206020	3208300	Right, for the last 10 minutes,
3208380	3214060	I'm just going to touch on consciousness in bacteria,
3214060	3215380	not in us.
3215380	3218700	When I say consciousness, let me confess,
3218700	3220540	probably what I'm going to talk about
3220540	3223540	is not what you would understand by consciousness.
3223540	3227020	But the question for me is a biochemist for a long time,
3227020	3228380	and I've never understood it,
3228380	3232380	is what are feelings in biochemical terms?
3232380	3235140	What we seem to care most about, I think, as humans,
3235140	3238860	and what we're scared about with AI and so on,
3238860	3242820	is will it become scarily human?
3242820	3244420	Will it become conscious?
3244420	3246020	Will it start being sentient,
3246020	3248300	have feelings, all of these kind of things?
3248300	3252220	A lot of people in the AI world are very interested now
3252220	3255460	in what does biology have to say about consciousness,
3255460	3258540	and the answer is, well, not very much.
3258540	3261660	It's been known as the hard problem for quite a long time,
3261660	3263220	and the hard problem, more or less,
3263220	3266380	is why is it that a feeling of pain,
3266380	3268700	or of hunger, or thirst, or whatever it may be,
3268700	3271380	what actually is that in terms of biochemistry?
3271380	3272980	If a neuron depolarises,
3272980	3277300	why does it give rise to a feeling of anything at all?
3277300	3281180	Now, in my view, it evolved,
3281180	3286300	but if it evolved, then natural selection acted on something,
3286300	3289340	and the question is, well, how far back does that go?
3289340	3291340	You can anesthetise all kinds of things,
3291420	3293580	you can anesthetise anomeba,
3293580	3295740	you can anesthetise bacteria.
3295740	3298420	So whatever it is that anesthetics are doing to consciousness
3298420	3300620	is not only at the level of a central nervous system,
3300620	3303340	it's also at the level of single-celled critters.
3303340	3305940	So what's happening?
3305940	3308180	What I've been saying about how bacteria,
3308180	3311180	how life started, this structure of cells,
3311180	3313940	and the three parts I've been talking about,
3313940	3316380	and especially the electric membranes,
3316380	3321980	what I'm going to put to you is that the electromagnetic fields,
3321980	3324900	electrostatic electromagnetic fields on these membranes
3324900	3328460	give a real-time integrated feedback to a bacterial cell
3328460	3330540	about how they're doing in the world,
3330540	3333500	and I'll explain that to you and then why that may lead
3333500	3338380	to the basis for amplifying everything as consciousness.
3338380	3341500	So a real-time integrated feedback on your state in the world,
3341500	3344140	I would say that's how it feels to be right now,
3344140	3346100	and for a bacterial cell that means,
3346100	3348540	am I good or am I bad, really not much more than that.
3348540	3353060	It's a kind of little bit of a binary system.
3353060	3356340	So imagine, here's a bacterial cell,
3356340	3360300	we've got the outside world and stuff happens in the outside world,
3360300	3362860	and it needs to detect whatever's going on out there
3362860	3365380	and do something.
3365380	3367980	It's a living cell.
3367980	3370180	It's inside all this God, it's the metabolism,
3370180	3371660	all this stuff I've been talking about,
3371660	3374100	all of these billions of reactions every second
3374100	3376740	that's going on inside, there's nothing else in there.
3376740	3378380	It's just chemistry.
3378380	3380940	It's got genes in there, but genes are slow as well,
3380940	3383260	so it's interesting.
3383260	3385860	We've got literally one billion reactions a second
3385860	3389580	going on inside here, and somehow they're going to determine
3389580	3393220	what that cell decides it's going to do.
3393220	3397180	So what I've been telling you about is this Krebs cycle,
3397180	3398980	and I'm keeping with the oxidative one here,
3398980	3400660	we're stripping out hydrogen CO2,
3400660	3402300	we've got food coming in,
3402300	3404580	and we're pumping protons across that membrane
3404580	3408580	to generate an electrical charge on the membrane.
3408580	3411140	So this is what I've been setting up all along.
3411140	3413700	But we don't have just one Krebs cycle in there,
3413700	3415420	we actually have scores of them,
3415420	3418980	probably thousands of them all spinning at the same time,
3418980	3422260	potentially at different rates.
3422260	3424460	There's all kinds of things that could be going on.
3424460	3429700	So what is synchronising that cell at the same rate?
3429700	3431940	To a larger extent, it's the charge on the membrane,
3431940	3433700	because all of them are plugged into the membrane,
3433700	3435260	and for them to spin,
3435260	3438100	they've got to push against the same force.
3438100	3441620	And also that force is powering ATP synthesis,
3441620	3443500	and for a lot of chemistry to happen in the cell,
3443500	3448020	you need ATP, and it needs to be far from equilibrium,
3448020	3451820	which is to say you need that ratio of ATP to ADP
3451820	3453340	to be a similar distance away.
3453340	3456060	So this charge on the membrane
3456060	3459060	is going to be forcing all of the biochemistry of the cell
3459060	3461180	into effectively the same state,
3461180	3463220	the same rate of operating,
3463220	3465140	and you can gauge what that is
3465140	3468340	from the strength of the charge on the membrane.
3468340	3472660	And also, because this is moving charge,
3472660	3475620	it will be generating electromagnetic fields as well.
3475620	3477540	I suspect, but cannot prove to you
3477540	3479380	that there's a balance between electromagnetic
3479380	3481420	and electrostatic fields that they can pick up on,
3481420	3483980	which gives them an idea of how they're doing
3483980	3485900	in relation to the environment.
3485900	3488740	So it needs to make a kind of a binary decision.
3488740	3491260	Let's imagine it's too hot,
3491260	3492540	or maybe there's toxins there.
3492540	3493500	What are you going to do?
3493500	3495460	Are you going to stay, or are you going to go?
3495460	3499020	Are you going to paddle with your flagellum and move across?
3499020	3501260	It's a two-bit decision.
3501260	3504220	Ready? Either you stay or you go.
3504220	3505060	One bit.
3505060	3509060	So you need to integrate all this information
3509060	3510020	on your state in the world.
3510020	3513220	Now, it could be that it's too hot.
3513220	3514060	What am I going to do?
3514060	3515580	My proteins are beginning to unravel,
3515580	3517140	they're beginning to come undone.
3517220	3519260	I'm going to set off some genes.
3519260	3521740	I'm going to activate some genes and a stress response,
3521740	3523300	which is going to fix my proteins.
3523300	3525420	But it's going to take half an hour
3525420	3527060	before these things are ready.
3527060	3529540	And the proteins, I need to refold them.
3529540	3531980	That's going to take minutes.
3531980	3532980	I can activate very...
3532980	3534780	But how do I know what I just did?
3535660	3539220	I need to have some idea now
3539220	3541980	about what my predicament is in the outside world.
3541980	3543260	I need to know it's too hot.
3543260	3544580	There has to be some information
3544660	3547420	that this system is giving me about my predicament.
3547420	3551460	I don't know yet because I just set off a gene response,
3551460	3552620	which is doing something,
3552620	3554140	but I don't know which genes I triggered
3554140	3555340	and I don't know what the problem is.
3555340	3558260	So this is where a feeling is beginning to come in.
3558260	3560460	It's effectively, I think it's too hot.
3560460	3562700	I should move over there
3562700	3565380	in terms of the fields on the membrane,
3565380	3567460	which is telling you the states that you're in.
3567460	3570220	It's integrating all this information on the membrane.
3570220	3571860	So that's what I'm proposing.
3572860	3575940	It's not completely hand-waving.
3575940	3577460	I mean, this, I admit, immediately
3577460	3579140	is the more hand-wavy bit of the talk.
3579140	3582700	I think the origin of life stuff is becoming science.
3582700	3585220	This is still philosophy, perhaps more than science,
3585220	3587060	but it's an interesting starting point.
3587060	3588260	But there is also some data.
3588260	3590620	So, for example, these are phages,
3590620	3594060	bacteria phages attacking a bacterium.
3594060	3595740	And it's quite interesting what happens
3595740	3598900	because lots of bacteria will kill themselves,
3598900	3601500	especially if they're part of a larger colony,
3601500	3602900	a biofilm, for example,
3602900	3607740	or some kind of ocean bloom of bacteria.
3607740	3608580	Why would they do that?
3608580	3610460	Why would a single cell kill itself?
3610460	3612500	Well, the answer, it's standard biology.
3612500	3613980	It's what's called kin selection.
3613980	3617020	And effectively, if you kill yourself,
3617020	3618660	you also prevent the viruses
3618660	3620380	from making copies of themselves.
3620380	3622020	Then they can't infect the next cell.
3622020	3625740	And so your genes and so on will do better in your relatives.
3625740	3628620	You don't even have to be very closely related to the next cell.
3628620	3630860	Still, you'll be somewhat related
3630860	3633180	and your genes will do better if you kill yourself.
3633180	3635460	So how do you, if you're in this predicament
3635460	3637100	of being taken down by viruses,
3637100	3638700	how do you kill yourself?
3638700	3640700	The answer is you unplug the membrane.
3640700	3642500	You collapse the membrane potential.
3642500	3643620	That's what you do.
3643620	3645660	That will kill you in seconds.
3645660	3647700	So this is really bacterial death.
3647700	3650700	It's all about the membrane potential,
3650700	3652220	which makes me think,
3652220	3655140	when they paddle, I showed you them paddling around,
3655140	3657300	this is proton powered.
3657300	3661620	Again, all the behaviour that bacteria do,
3661620	3664140	all the import and export of things across that membrane
3664140	3667500	is all powered by that membrane potential.
3667500	3670100	So this is very much the life and death
3670100	3673100	of what bacterial cells are actually doing.
3673100	3676060	Now, this I think is the final slide.
3678100	3682460	We are made of more complex cells.
3682460	3684860	We're made of eukaryotic cells.
3684860	3686340	Eukaryotes have lots of mitochondria.
3686340	3687940	These are the same things I've been showing you.
3687940	3690780	These are all individual bacteria that became included
3690780	3692220	in a much larger cell,
3692220	3694980	or it became a larger cell in the end.
3694980	3697460	And they're all doing the same kind of thing,
3697460	3698940	but now they've got to speak to each other.
3698940	3700340	There's different ways they can do that.
3700340	3701940	They can fuse together and fission.
3701940	3703540	There's all kinds of things they do,
3703540	3707700	but somehow they're all together responsible for metabolism.
3707700	3710060	And in a strange way, because when we breathe oxygen,
3710060	3711540	it's going straight here.
3711540	3714380	And when we're digesting food and burning food,
3714380	3715700	it's going straight here.
3715700	3718980	So although this is the interface with the world,
3718980	3721020	really what's happening is going on here.
3721020	3723500	Any problems that we have in relation to the world,
3723500	3726660	we feel them foremost in our mitochondria.
3726660	3728780	And we need to integrate this information
3728780	3731300	across maybe hundreds or thousands of mitochondria.
3731300	3733940	And again, I'm thinking that fields are one way
3733940	3735540	in which this can happen.
3735540	3738300	And then this is a single cell like an amoeba cell.
3738300	3740220	Then we have multicellular organisms,
3740220	3742060	and now we've got cells to bring together
3742060	3743580	all with these moving parts inside.
3743580	3745780	And finally, a central nervous system,
3745780	3747500	which amplifies all of this.
3747500	3750380	So the communications, the electrical communications
3750380	3753140	between single cells and their interface with the world,
3753140	3755100	becoming incorporated into larger cells,
3755100	3757780	incorporated into multicellular organisms,
3757780	3759420	and finally into a central nervous system.
3759420	3761820	This, I'm suggesting, is the substrate,
3761820	3765180	which gives rise in the end to the complexity
3765180	3766740	of our own consciousness.
3768780	3769820	This is what I've said.
3769820	3771060	Perhaps I don't need to say it again.
3771060	3772380	I feel like I'm running out of time.
3772380	3775060	So what I'm going to say instead is thank you
3775060	3777580	to the guys in my lab who've been working on this.
3777580	3779740	It's pretty brave for them to do it at all.
3779740	3781660	This is, in fact, an old slide.
3781660	3783940	They're holding the Krebs cycle, and I like that so much.
3783940	3786860	It was a birthday present a few years ago that I've kept it.
3786860	3788420	So half these guys have now left my lab,
3788420	3790340	and I've had to put the ones who've joined
3790340	3792100	since then around the outside.
3792100	3793860	I suppose I'll have to change this at some point,
3793860	3799020	but it's a brave thing to do a PhD on the origin of life.
3799020	3801540	And I'm beginning to start thinking about doing experiments
3801540	3803740	on consciousness, which is probably even more foolhardy
3803740	3805220	for them to join me.
3805220	3807260	So I want to thank them especially.
3807260	3809460	Thanks to the funders, and thank you very much
3809460	3810980	for the invitation and for listening,
3810980	3812900	and I'm very happy to take questions.
