1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
Ja, einen wunderschönen guten Abend. Ich darf Sie herzlich heute Abend hier begrüßen

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,600
im Affirmengrat. Wir haben einen sehr illustren Gast, der heute hier zu uns zu Ihnen zu mir

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,720
sprechen wird. Mein Name ist Sebastian Braunes. Ich darf heute ein bisschen durch den Abend

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,840
führen. Freue mich, dass Sie so zahlreich erschienen sind und schon in großteiligere

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,680
Plätze eingenommen haben. Das Ganze heute am Abend wird sich in einem kurzen Überblick

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,840
für Sie ungefähr so gestalten. Ich rede jetzt da mit Ihnen bis alle da sind und versuche

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,840
die Zeit ein bisschen zu überbrücken. Und dann begrüße ich Herrn Schischek, der kommt

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,520
dann auf die Bühne, wenn Sie wollen, applaudieren Sie. Und danach spricht Herr Schischek zu Ihnen

9
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,080
und ein bisschen auch zu mir. Und danach wird das Ganze ein Gespräch und das Schöne an

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,600
dem Gespräch ist, dass wir hier so ein großes Forum haben und dass es unbedingt wichtig

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,560
wäre und auch gewollt ist, dass ich dann vielleicht mit einer oder anderen Frage oder

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,800
mit einer oder anderen Ergänzung zu dem, was der Herr Schischek so von sich geben wird,

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:18,360
einmengen. Es ist nur eine weitere Sache wichtig. Das Ganze endet um 19.30 Uhr und es findet

14
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:27,560
danach ein Konzert statt. Deswegen würde ich Sie bitten, geordnet und ruhig, aber rasch,

15
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,720
den Saal zu verlassen, weil die Sessel auf denen Sie sitzen, die müssen dann auch noch

16
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,920
raus und weil die keine Beine haben oder beziehungsweise die haben vier Beine natürlich, aber die können

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,320
nicht selber gehen. Die müssen dann von dienstfertigen Helfern und Helferinnen entfernt werden und

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,760
das dauert ein bisschen und deswegen wäre es gut, wenn wir pünktlich Schluss machen.

19
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:53,600
Ich werde mich jetzt auch nicht so lang darin erschöpfen, den Herrn Professor Schischek vorzustellen,

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:02,160
weil ich bin fast 100%ig überzeugt, dass Sie alle deswegen da sind, weil Sie in Kennen

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,880
sich vielleicht eine andere Meinung zu im Bilden wollen oder was er sagt, bzw. in Kennen

22
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,960
lernen wollen, aber sich ein bisschen informiert haben vorher, zum Beispiel im Internet. Also

23
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:22,960
da gibt es die ärgsten Sachen und ja, wirklich schwer, ich bin auch manchmal dort. Und deswegen

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,120
glaube ich, muss ich jetzt nicht ausführlich alle Buchtitel aufzählen bzw. sagen, an welchen

25
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,640
Instituten er Professorinstühle hält und mit welchen Markanten und Markigen und vielleicht

26
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,240
auch kontroversellen Äußerungen er bis jetzt schon aufgefallen ist oder dass er sich sehr

27
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:45,720
viel Kritik gefallen lassen musste, weil er fast kaum seine eigene These aus sich selbst

28
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,640
herausentwickelt, verteidigt, sondern meistens referenziert, aber es ist das Feld der Philosophie,

29
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,280
Gott sei Dank ein Weites und gerade in Zeiten wie diesen vielleicht auch wichtig, dass

30
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,320
wir auch heute hier gemeinsam den Gedanken einer Kommunikation und eines Vorurums miteinander

31
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:09,240
hochhalten. Das Elevates Festival stellt diese Begegnung hier auch ein bisschen unter den

32
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:16,120
Gedanken der unlikely Alliances, also zu Deutsch vielleicht etwas untypischen Allianzen und

33
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,680
ich hoffe, so eine kann heute hier auch unter möglichst der Negation dieser Rampe, die

34
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,080
immer leider auch ein bisschen segregierend ist zwischen ihnen und dem, was hier passiert,

35
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:32,840
stattfinden. Markig gesprochen wird es wohl um Katastrophen gehen, das ist ja prinzipiell

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,240
nichts Schlimmes, kann man sich auch oft im Internet anschauen, wo es wie gesagt die ärgsten

37
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,840
Sachen gibt und sie sind ja auch quasi auf eine gewisse Art und weiß es sich auch der

38
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,840
Kit, der uns irgendwie alle zusammenhalten, wo wir zusammenrücken können, wenn wir wollen

39
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,280
und gemeinsam was meistern und vielleicht auch was schaffen, was wir alleine gar nicht so

40
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,800
schaffen können. Aber auf der anderen Seite beinhalten sie natürlich auch die Gefahr,

41
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,040
dass das Individuum vielleicht ein bisschen zurückstecken muss und das ist gerade in Zeiten

42
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,720
wie diesen und an einem Tag wie heute. Vielleicht gar nicht so eine angenehme Sache. Es ist auch

43
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:11,240
irgendwie interessant, dass 90 Jahre in der Vergangenheit von genau heute aus die 1. Republik

44
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,480
Österreich sich zum ersten Mal verabschiedert hat und der ständige Staat übernommen. Das Parlament

45
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:23,040
hat sich ausgeschaltet und jetzt ist es 90 Jahre später und wir haben noch immer trying times,

46
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,320
vielleicht sogar noch mehr, liegt vielleicht auch daran, dass wir alle viel besser informiert sind

47
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,360
oder vermeintlich besser informiert sind. Also ich freue mich sehr, dass ich jetzt hier auf der

48
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,480
Bühne Professor Slavoj Sijek begrüßen darf. Begrüßen Sie ihn mit mir, bitte.

49
00:04:46,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Charles Chaplin, das ist ein Great Dictator, er stopps die Applaus.

50
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:14,480
Ok, ich muss mich erst entschuldigen, ich verstehe deutsche Sprache eventuelle Fragen.

51
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:22,480
Sie können die Fragen natürlich auf Deutsch stellen, nur ich kann nicht flüssig Deutsch sprechen

52
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:30,480
und eine kleine Kritik an dir, was habe ich dort gehört, das bin ich nicht, Herr Professor Doktor.

53
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,480
Was habe ich dir zu dir gemacht?

54
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Hast du deine Mutter geschraubt oder was?

55
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Eigentlich, eigentlich, ich habe genau das Opposite gemacht. Ich habe gesagt, ich möchte nicht auf

56
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:48,480
deinem Doktor und Professor Kajos erledigen. Das ist gut, ja, weil ich mich für diesen

57
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:55,480
Backtaste spielen will. Du bist braunisch, ich bin braunisch, ich bin blühig.

58
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
Ich bin blühiger als du.

59
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Ich bin blühiger als du.

60
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,480
Ok, ich bin sorry, jetzt ist es seriös.

61
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,480
Wenn du mich erlaubst, ich werde nicht zu lange versuchen.

62
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Bitte, wenn du dir fühlst, dass etwas provokative ist, es ist aufgrund der Perfektivität,

63
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:23,480
nicht zu beleidigen dich, nicht zu kürzen dich, sondern einfach zu bringen aus der realen Debatte.

64
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Weil ich denke, dass auf beiden Seiten der sogenannten Gewöhnung, liberalen Seite und den sogenannten

65
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:38,480
neuen Fundamentalisten, Rechtesten der Debatte weniger und weniger möglich ist.

66
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,480
So, lasst mich beginnen.

67
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:51,480
Ich war so glücklich zu lernen, dass der generalte Titel dieser Event Unholy Alliances.

68
00:06:52,480 --> 00:07:03,480
Weil das schon die Antwort zu meinem Titel, nur eine Katastrophe, was uns zu sagen kann.

69
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,480
Warum? Weil wir in einem Zeitpunkt Unholy Alliances leben.

70
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Ich werde es versuchen, und dann gehen wir auf einen freien Dialog.

71
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Ich werde es versuchen, diesen Dialog zu holen, auch wenn es manchmal lustig ist.

72
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,480
Es ist sehr schwer und seriös.

73
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Ich denke, dass wir heute wirklich leben.

74
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Es ist nicht eine empty Phase, in einem komplexen Zeitpunkt.

75
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,480
Nicht komplex in diesem empirischen Sinn.

76
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,480
Ja, die Situation ist immer komplex.

77
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,480
Also, zum Beispiel, um einen Schritt zur aktuellen Situation zu machen.

78
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Ich bin, natürlich, in dieser Welt pro-Ukrainian.

79
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Und ich liebe, wenn meine Freunde mir sagen, aber Sie wissen, dass die Ukrainien nicht so gut sind.

80
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Die Situation ist sehr komplex.

81
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Wobei, die Situation ist immer komplex.

82
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,480
In World War II, es war nicht einfach Demokratie gegen Nationalismus.

83
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Weil ich sorry, Stalin war nicht Demokratie und so weiter.

84
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
Und wir mussten zusammen mit den Fortschreitern.

85
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Aber ich werde mich direkt mit einem großen Unholy Alliances beobachten.

86
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Was Putin, nicht nur Putin, ist zu Ende geäußert.

87
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Ich weiß nicht, wer Putin ist.

88
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Und sie hat mir gesagt, was Putin macht, ist interessant.

89
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Auf der einen Seite ist er auf der Orthodox-Church-Support.

90
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Die, wie man es nennt, Patriarch, oder sowas von der Orthodox-Church in Russland.

91
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
In Russland, Kirill.

92
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,480
Er ist ein alter KGB-Fellow von Putin.

93
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Aber nicht nur das.

94
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Putin hat etwas sehr Interessantes gemacht.

95
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,480
Er hat Kontrolle.

96
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Eine Gruppe von jungen leftistischen Marxisten.

97
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,480
Und sie sind diejenigen, die ihm hissen wollen.

98
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,480
Er ist fast offen.

99
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Eine konservative Art der Argumentation.

100
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,480
Western Europe ist der Realum von Satanismus.

101
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,480
Kirill, Patriarch, hat auch den größten Exorzisten der Zeit geklärt.

102
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,480
Ich habe eine wundervolle Debatte auf Russland.

103
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Ich folge es.

104
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Ich meine, um eine ideologische Bedeutung.

105
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Wenn jemand die Pro-Putin-Figur betrifft und sagt,

106
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:56,480
aber bist du wirklich sicher, dass die Ukrainien die Nazis generieren?

107
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Und der Mann sagt, okay,

108
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,480
wenn du abstrakt bist, ignorierst alle anderen Dinge,

109
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,480
und du bist in Kirill, wie der größte Horror.

110
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Aber was machen die Marxisten?

111
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Sie geben...

112
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,480
An dieser anderen Art der Argumentation,

113
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,480
ist, dass wir für alle dritten Menschen

114
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,480
gegen die imperialisten, neokolonialisten,

115
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,480
sowas wie die Westerndominanz haben.

116
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,480
Und die dritte Sache ist, wie?

117
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Diese beiden Aktien,

118
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,480
die ersten, anti, gay, LGBT, Westerndekadenz,

119
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,480
und die anderen, wie die Western-Imperialisten und so,

120
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,480
bekommen zusammen,

121
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
das ist eine Katastrophe.

122
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,480
Das ist die erste unruhige Allianz.

123
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
Check in your newspapers.

124
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,480
It happened a day or two ago in Uganda.

125
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,480
The parliament passed a terrifying law,

126
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,480
that if you are caught in homosexual relationship,

127
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,480
it's not just you are a little bit ostracized.

128
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,480
You can even get death penalty,

129
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,480
but at least ten years of prison and all that.

130
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,480
And then when a Western journalist protested,

131
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,480
this happened two days ago.

132
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:42,480
A member of Ugandan parliament told him,

133
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,480
you are either with us supporting our anti gay legislation

134
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,480
or you are with the Western world.

135
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,480
This is a terrifying unholy alliance,

136
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,480
that you address third world nations,

137
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:10,480
but at the same time playing this sexually conservative,

138
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,480
anti gay rights, anti LGBT plus and so on logic.

139
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,480
And so can you imagine for so called,

140
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,480
I hate the term, but I will use it as an abbreviation,

141
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,480
for so called non binary people.

142
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,480
You use the general term.

143
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:42,480
You know what's the bad news that to fight for gay rights

144
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,480
in all this is perceived in many countries

145
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,480
as part of Western imperialism.

146
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:01,480
This alliance had to be broken somehow.

147
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Now I go to another example of this unholy alliance.

148
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,480
I think maybe you know more like two weeks ago or three,

149
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,480
when there were big pro freedom,

150
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,480
pro peace demonstrations in Berlin and in Dresden and so on.

151
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,480
I mean, I almost cried.

152
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,480
It's so sad.

153
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,480
Part of the linke Partei in Deutschland,

154
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,480
Sarah Wagenknecht, gave a speech,

155
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,480
all this false pacifist stuff.

156
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Why should we get involved?

157
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,480
This is not our war blah blah blah.

158
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,480
And then you know what she got next day.

159
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Not ironically an invitation from a high ranking member

160
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,480
of alternative für Deutschland.

161
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,480
But you speak like us, like join us and so on.

162
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,480
And this is not a joke.

163
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,480
This is now happening in my own country in Slovenia,

164
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,480
in England, in United States and so on,

165
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:19,480
that the pro Russian attitude is adopted by extreme left

166
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,480
and extreme right.

167
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
Why?

168
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
Well, maybe you know this joke,

169
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,480
but what came to my mind is this,

170
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,480
I even wrote a book with this in the title,

171
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,480
the wonderful simple,

172
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:43,480
but nonetheless a joke by Freud from his book on Witz,

173
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,480
on jokes, where he quotes this joke,

174
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,480
where you give too many arguments for a thing,

175
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,480
but they are mutually exclusive,

176
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,480
like the book I wrote against the Iraq war,

177
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,480
American attack on Iraq has the title,

178
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,480
the broken Iraqi, this cap or whatever.

179
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,480
Like I borrow from you a cap or an a vase,

180
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,480
and I return it to you broken.

181
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,480
And you of course accuse me.

182
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,480
And my answer is A, I never borrow a vase from you B.

183
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
I return it to you full,

184
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,480
and C, it was already broken when you gave it to me.

185
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,480
I notice that this pro sympathy for Russia argument

186
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,480
has exactly the same structure.

187
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Did you notice that there are three arguments?

188
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,480
First is generally pacifist.

189
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,480
Wars are madness.

190
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,480
We shouldn't give arms because of the general wisdom.

191
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,480
If you give arms, you only prolong the conflict.

192
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,480
This is, I think, a terrifying notion.

193
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,480
Because at the same time this pacifist's claim,

194
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,480
but now there is a situation more or less,

195
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,480
how to call it, stable position on front,

196
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,480
to push for peace.

197
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,480
Yes, but how did we arrive at this position?

198
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
By supporting Ukraine.

199
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,480
Can you imagine what would have happened there without?

200
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,480
And then I draw a comparison,

201
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
for which I got much hatred,

202
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,480
that I draw a parallel between today's Pisonics

203
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,480
and some crazy communists.

204
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,480
At the beginning of World War II,

205
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,480
when on the West they had that phony war,

206
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,480
who claimed this is imperialist conflict.

207
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,480
We should stay neutral and fraternized

208
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,480
with German soldiers.

209
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,480
This is not our war and so on and so on.

210
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,480
So, the first reasoning is this abstract pacifist.

211
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,480
I disagree with it, not because I like war.

212
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:14,480
But I think it's absolutely clear that Russia is engaged

213
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,480
in the long-term geopolitical rearrangement.

214
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,480
And it's clear, not by any sinister hermeneutics,

215
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,480
but they say it, the Russian, that they want to go on.

216
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,480
Moldova, now they officially claim to have real peace.

217
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,480
We have to push the borders of Poland a little bit to the West.

218
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,480
We already have Georgian Georgia.

219
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,480
We already had Crimea and so on.

220
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,480
So, I think that's the paradox.

221
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,480
I accept that.

222
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:59,480
Yes, we shouldn't aim at destroying Russia.

223
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,480
That's unacceptable.

224
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,480
But Habermas Jürgen,

225
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,480
who we don't like each other personally,

226
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,480
but he put it very nicely almost a year ago,

227
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:18,480
where he says we shouldn't speak the language of destroy Russia.

228
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,480
But simply negatively, Ukraine must not perish.

229
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,480
It's in our interest.

230
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,480
Especially, again, in view of this more and more crazy,

231
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,480
directly male-Sovienist ideological foundation,

232
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,480
which is Western Europe is the reign of Satan,

233
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,480
unholy orgies and all that stuff.

234
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Now, here again,

235
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,480
there is unfortunately a moment of truth

236
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:09,480
that the West is still engaged many times in some kind of

237
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,480
neo-colonial, post-colonial exploitation.

238
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,480
But my answer to this is double.

239
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,480
First, do you think that China is any better?

240
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,480
I don't know what our media report.

241
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,480
I know that when Chinese buy some resources,

242
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,480
some mines in, I think it was Zambia, when they bought them,

243
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,480
there was a local rebellion.

244
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:46,480
Because the local workers there wanted monthly salary of $200.

245
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
It was too much.

246
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Chinese brought their own start people who were ready to work

247
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,480
for a little bit over $100 per month and so on.

248
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:01,480
So, neo-colonialism is expanding, but it's everywhere.

249
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:10,480
Second thing that makes this alliance between left and Putin unholy is,

250
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,480
I don't know what's the logic.

251
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,480
Yes, another thing, sorry, the first argument.

252
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,480
We want peace, peace at any price,

253
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
and usually in my country in Slovenia,

254
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:28,480
then the politicians who follow this line add something very cynical.

255
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:37,480
They say every war has to end up with negotiations and compromise.

256
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,480
And my answer to them is, ah, really?

257
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
Then we were thought wrong.

258
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,480
Do you remember in 45, there were negotiations and packed with Hitler?

259
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,480
No, it wasn't.

260
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,480
There was a clear defeat.

261
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:06,480
So again, this general pacifist stance has to be rejected on behalf of real peace itself.

262
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Remember one thing that I repeat all the time.

263
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Peace is always in the interest of the occupier.

264
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,480
I believe, I'm not anti-Semitic, I'm totally pro-Jewish.

265
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,480
But on the West Bank, Israel is colonizing it.

266
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,480
And when Israel says we want peace there, I believe them.

267
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Because peace means they can occupy it in peace.

268
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,480
Of course, even Germans, when they occupied France in 39,

269
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,480
where they sincerely for peace, of course they were.

270
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
Peace means we can occupy it.

271
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,480
That's why General De Gaulle, you know what was his great statement,

272
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
which found that resistance.

273
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,480
No, the war is not over.

274
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
France did not capitulate.

275
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,480
So I reject this general line.

276
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Then the second line of defense is, what I already mentioned, the situation is complex.

277
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Nobody is clear there.

278
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,480
I know, I will not bore you now with it, but I can give you some,

279
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,480
once I enumerated them, some 15 to 20 points of mistakes,

280
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,480
stupidities committed by Ukrainians.

281
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,480
But sorry, this is like condemning and we should.

282
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:37,480
For example, the Allied attack in March 45, I think, on Dresden,

283
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,480
which was totally unnecessary militarily.

284
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:49,480
Or, for example, the Allied bombing of Hamburg with those terrible storms.

285
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
Why?

286
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,480
Because, as parents of my friends in Hamburg told me,

287
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,480
you know what they did, the Allies, they were obsessed with the idea

288
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,480
that it's more important to broke the morale of the working class

289
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,480
than to destroy industry.

290
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,480
So they focused their bombings on working class suburbs

291
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,480
and they left all the great villas and so on and so on.

292
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,480
But nonetheless, this doesn't change the fact who was right.

293
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,480
So often complexity is an excuse.

294
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,480
And the third argument is a vulgar pragmatic one.

295
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,480
It's not our war.

296
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:43,480
Why should we, because of two crazy nations fighting on the edge of Europe,

297
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,480
why should we pay more for electricity and so on and so on?

298
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:56,480
I find, again, I find this logic terrifying.

299
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,480
It's true what my friends are saying, some pro Russians,

300
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:08,480
that the conflict in Ukraine is a conflict between two visions of the world.

301
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,480
But their interpretation is it's western imperialist vision

302
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:24,480
and authentic multicultural vision of coexistence and so on of different both.

303
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,480
I don't like the coexistence that Putin stands for.

304
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,480
You know where you get a model of this coexistence.

305
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:38,480
You remember when Taliban took over, they immediately made peace with China.

306
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,480
The deal was what?

307
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:48,480
You Chinese allow us in Afghanistan to do what we want, to treat women the way we do.

308
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:55,480
But we will not mess with what you are doing with Uyghur Muslims in your country.

309
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,480
It tells a lot, if you look at who are Russia's direct allies today.

310
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,480
Iran, North Korea and so on, Afghanistan even.

311
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:13,480
It tells you a lot about how, and this is a horrible thing to accept,

312
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,480
yes, world imperialism and so on and so on.

313
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:27,480
But my God, can't we accept that in spite of all the horrors of western imperialism,

314
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,480
what Putin stands for is nonetheless worse.

315
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:39,480
And now I come to first time, I return to my title, Catastrophe Can Save Us.

316
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:47,480
You know that the latest news I got from my friends in Ukraine, give a little bit of hope.

317
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:54,480
Ukraine no doubt was an extremely corrupted country and so on with all the oligarchs.

318
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,480
But do you know that now the left is awakening slowly there?

319
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:08,480
They said, organizing themselves, wait a minute, half, even more of the oligarchs.

320
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,480
I don't know, it is here in Austria.

321
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:19,480
For example, many of them came to Slovenia and close to Austrian border, Radenska, a big spa.

322
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,480
They simply rented for month the biggest luxurious hotel and so on.

323
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,480
And people in Ukraine are asking, we are doing the fighting, they are doing that.

324
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:39,480
It's under their pressure that Zelensky is now organizing this anti-corruption campaign.

325
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:48,480
He knows that people are not simply fighting, they are raising the crucial question, which is,

326
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,480
but what is the Ukraine for which we are fighting?

327
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,480
Will it be the same extremely corrupted oligarchs system?

328
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,480
And that's why I wrote a text for which I was attacked.

329
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:09,480
Maybe, I don't know if it appeared in Germany, with the title Ukraine Between Two Colonizations.

330
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,480
Yes, Russia wants to colonize it.

331
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,480
But what do you think the West is doing?

332
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:23,480
Do you know that they have in the South, the black earth, allegedly the most fertile West in the world?

333
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:34,480
But do you know that one third of this best earth in the world is already owned by American agricultural corporations?

334
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Do you know that there is all the time pressure also from the West on Ukraine,

335
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:50,480
that it should become neokonomically at least dependent on the West?

336
00:27:50,480 --> 00:28:00,480
My hope is that now, maybe something will come out of it, maybe not, that Ukraine will begin to awaken.

337
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Also, to ask the question again, again, not just free Ukraine, but what kind of Ukraine.

338
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:19,480
So, another thing, then people tell me, and I come again to this, I'm holding a lens, and so on,

339
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:29,480
other people are telling me, but these are just words, okay, putting talks against Satanism, world domination,

340
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,480
but he really wants just a piece of land there, a little bit.

341
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,480
No, sorry, this is a big philosophical even mistake.

342
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,480
Ideologie is never just ideology.

343
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,480
It has its own power, you pay the price for it.

344
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Look at the Nazis.

345
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:57,480
The standard Marx explanation is anti-Semitism was just an ersatz for class and camp.

346
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,480
Really, they wanted to keep capitalism, Nazis, and so on.

347
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:09,480
Yeah, but the result was nonetheless millions of death, and so on.

348
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,480
And ideology gets its own efficiency.

349
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,480
Like, I don't know why this anecdote stuck so deeply in my mind,

350
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,480
when in 44 Germany was withdrawing from Greek islands.

351
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,480
They noticed that on one island they left 150 Jews.

352
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:41,480
And in that crazy situation where they needed every soldier, they sent a military boat back to get those Jews.

353
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,480
This didn't help them militarily in any way.

354
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:53,480
So again, I don't buy this story, it's really just about material interests.

355
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,480
No, ideology is to be taken seriously.

356
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,480
My next conclusion here to provoke you a little bit with philosophy.

357
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,480
This is why I am sick and tired of this critique of capitalism, that it's egotist.

358
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,480
We care only for our interests.

359
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:19,480
No, the problem of capitalism is, as Walter Benjamin knew, that it's a religious phenomenon,

360
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,480
a religious in the sense of radical sacrifice, a true fanatical capitalist.

361
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
He doesn't enjoy good life.

362
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:35,480
He is ready to work all the time fanatically so that capital reproduces itself.

363
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,480
No, we need today more egotism.

364
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,480
We need to ask not what about the fate of living on earth, but my God,

365
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:53,480
and my children live in 20, 30 years from now if we go on with this destruction of nature.

366
00:30:53,480 --> 00:31:04,480
No, we should appeal to good egotism against this false capitalist ethics.

367
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,480
Now, the next point.

368
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Ah, now things get, this was nothing to the provocation, more difficult.

369
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:21,480
The next unholy alliance that I see, trigger warning, this will be problematic for some of you.

370
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:31,480
Although I am, I cannot say it more, I have a whole school of followers among trans people, real trans people.

371
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,480
Not just that game, you know.

372
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Now I'm a woman, I feel like a man and so on, but people who went through all the painful operations and so on,

373
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:47,480
and it's not just change, man into a woman, but trying to invent something third.

374
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,480
And you know where I agree with them?

375
00:31:50,480 --> 00:32:01,480
LGBT Plus, in principle, I totally support it, not just in words, I was engaged in actions and so on.

376
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:08,480
But I don't like this anti-psychoanalytic trend.

377
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,480
The common place in many of these circles, in Germany, especially in the United States,

378
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:24,480
oh Freud is an old white dead man, he still thought in binary terms, eddipal complex and so on.

379
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,480
No, you know what's my problem?

380
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:34,480
You know this big conflict, especially in United States and United States,

381
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:44,480
between, let's call it biological determinists and LGBT feminists.

382
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
I simplify to the utmost.

383
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Biological determinists claim that sexism, even if sex is confused, you don't know what you are,

384
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:03,480
but basically it's predetermined with your genetic structure or education or whatever,

385
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,480
and it's not a matter of free choice.

386
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:16,480
On the opposite hand you have non-binary, in the wrong way I claim people,

387
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,480
who claim people should be allowed to freely choose.

388
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,480
It's a matter of choice, how you feel.

389
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:34,480
I claim there is an unholy alliance here because they both behave as if Freud didn't exist.

390
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:46,480
For an authentic Freudian, of course sex is human sexuality is not directly a biological phenomenon.

391
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:55,480
It's how some Grundlage, some foundation is mediated, caught in a totally different logic

392
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:03,480
and it can even be, I have a friend, even can be demonstrated with experiments.

393
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:12,480
I have a friend who studies sexuality in apes, well-developed apes, gorillas, orangutans and men

394
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,480
and discovered that apes are much more rational.

395
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
Sorry for my tasteless way of saying.

396
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,480
Let's say you are a beautiful ape, woman.

397
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,480
I am an orangutans also.

398
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,480
I would like to have sex with you, but I see no way.

399
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,480
So ok, Fakoff, I turn attention elsewhere.

400
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,480
It's only with humans that you get this type of fix attachment,

401
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,480
that the more you are inaccessible to me, the more I'm obsessed.

402
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,480
So the whole logic changes.

403
00:34:52,480 --> 00:35:01,480
Second point of Freud, crucial and some true LGBT people are well aware of it.

404
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,480
You know, sex is not in this vulgar sense a matter of free choice.

405
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,480
I feel like that.

406
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:16,480
No, the big revolution of Freud is that, one has to read him properly,

407
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:24,480
that this patriarchal symbolic order, male position, patriarchal feminine,

408
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,480
it's not natural, it's a long and painful process,

409
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,480
because we have something, we humans unique.

410
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,480
What Freud characterized as childhood infantile sexuality.

411
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,480
It's something very strange.

412
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,480
Animals, as far as we know, don't have it.

413
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,480
Because of the delayed puberty, we have it.

414
00:35:53,480 --> 00:36:01,480
This idea that you get caught in crazy fantasies, how are children born?

415
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,480
And these fantasies can be very beautiful.

416
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,480
Let me tell intimate confession.

417
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,480
I clearly remember them, two of fantasies from my own youth.

418
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,480
When I vaguely knew that sex has to do something with health,

419
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,480
sorry, with childbirth.

420
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,480
With reproduction, yeah.

421
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,480
Yeah, with reproduction with copulation.

422
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,480
But I didn't know exactly how.

423
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,480
So one of my infantile theories was, and women liked it very much later,

424
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,480
that sex is long hard work.

425
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:42,480
You have to have, again and again, like you tell to your lover now again,

426
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,480
Orangutang and his wife, I tell you, let's screw, let's have sex today,

427
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,480
today we will work on the hands, tomorrow again on the legs.

428
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,480
You have to do it, I like this fantasy.

429
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,480
I think the whole body is, yes.

430
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,480
And then we may check, if you like the hands, and if you don't like them,

431
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,480
do it again, do it again.

432
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,480
The second one I have, I hear this story that Storks,

433
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,480
how do you call them, the stupid birds, are bringing babies.

434
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,480
And my dream was this one, that it's better if you want a nice child,

435
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,480
or a child, to do it with open windows.

436
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,480
Because Storks are observing you.

437
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,480
And if you make love in a nice way, you get a child, you know.

438
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,480
And now, this is not just a joke, because the big Freudian theory is not.

439
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,480
Then once we become mature, we know how it is.

440
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:48,480
No. All the time, to the end, human sexuality is accompanied by fantasies.

441
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,480
Freud's big question is not this vulgar psychoanalytic,

442
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,480
whatever you are doing, you are always thinking about F, you know.

443
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,480
It's on the contrary.

444
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,480
But what are you thinking when you are doing F?

445
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,480
And here, you, Austrians, published a wonderful book by my friend.

446
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:14,480
You know, they discovered Wittgenstein's Geheimer Tagebücher from World War I.

447
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,480
And he's brutally open.

448
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,480
He describes what he's thinking about when he was masturbating.

449
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,480
You know what he was?

450
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:31,480
Not gay sex, but discussing with colleagues philosophical questions and so on.

451
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,480
That's the spirit.

452
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,480
So what I want to say, but you see what I'm saying.

453
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:47,480
Freud makes it aware that human sexuality is a very complex phenomenon.

454
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:54,480
It doesn't emerge naturally, but through a series of traumatic cuts.

455
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:03,480
And in this sense, the process is self-contradictory, mostly unconscious and so on.

456
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:10,480
So it's not as some LGBT plus people like to simplify, you know.

457
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,480
Okay, I feel that I am that.

458
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,480
My point is, how do you know that you really feel this?

459
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,480
To Freud, it was clear that feelings cannot be relied on.

460
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,480
They often cheat.

461
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
Elementary stupid example.

462
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,480
You, you or me, okay, I will not blame you.

463
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,480
What if I am secretly gay, but I don't want to admit to myself,

464
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,480
so I enact this as homophobia, you know.

465
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,480
So, what I'm saying, and again, please, don't buy this cheap stuff.

466
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,480
People should be allowed to choose their sexual identity.

467
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:58,480
Yes, but it's not as simple as that, because it's not simply a conscious choice.

468
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,480
It's not that you sit there and think, okay, it would be nice to have a lady.

469
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,480
It can be funny with men, but other options.

470
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,480
Okay, this sounds the best one.

471
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:14,480
No, I will give you an example, which I always like, love.

472
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,480
Love is free, otherwise it's not true love.

473
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:25,480
I cannot tell to you, I will try not to accuse the time harassing.

474
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,480
I tell, you love is not.

475
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,480
I compare you, you and you and say, okay, you have nice legs, you have nice eyes.

476
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,480
You love, okay, then I make a list, you are the best, and I will choose you.

477
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,480
No, love has the structure of theology.

478
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,480
Where is Kierkegaard, my favorite guy, said.

479
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:53,480
To choose your religion, it's not that you compare different religions

480
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:58,480
and then follow, like, I compare Buddhism, which is not even a religion,

481
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,480
Muslim, Jews, I don't know whom.

482
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,480
And I said, my God, Christianity has the best arguments.

483
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:12,480
No, you get the arguments, only you understand the arguments only once you believe.

484
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,480
When you already believe.

485
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,480
Now you will say, this is religious obskurantism.

486
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,480
No, so Marx is saying the same.

487
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,480
When he says proletarian position is not, I look around,

488
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,480
his story, I see, oh, workers will win, so let's join them.

489
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:39,480
No, Marx's truth is a truth, which appears only from a subjectively engaged position.

490
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,480
So you see what's my point here.

491
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:49,480
That let's all the rights to LGBT plus, but really listen to them

492
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,480
and be aware of the complexity.

493
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,480
Like, I was now involved, some people attacked me, totally misunderstood me,

494
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,480
because into a polemic about so-called puberty blockers.

495
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,480
I don't know if you use them then, but in England they widely use them.

496
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,480
The idea is this one.

497
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:20,480
When you are 10, 11, if you are not sure independently of biological sex,

498
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:29,480
if you are not sure what sex you are, at that point you cannot decide,

499
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:42,480
but so that you will not be pressured under the conditions of heterosexual patriarchal domination.

500
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:52,480
They give you puberty blockers, which delay postpone for a couple of years your sexual maturation.

501
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,480
With a horrifying, for me, totally naive idea that in this couple of years

502
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,480
you will become mature enough to see what you want.

503
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:09,480
Of course, now they are discovering slowly that first these puberty blockers

504
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:18,480
do many problematic things, they disturb the whole process of your biological development,

505
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,480
not just sexual identity, but other things, it's very risky.

506
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:32,480
But also I think this idea is totally wrong, namely the idea that with maturity you are free to choose.

507
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,480
No, sexual identity is for me like love.

508
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:44,480
I appeal to your, if you were lucky enough to be in love with men, women, I'm not playing these games, anybody.

509
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:51,480
You never fall in love in the sense of, oh, now I decide to fall in love.

510
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,480
Beware of temporality here.

511
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,480
You all of a sudden discover that you are already in love.

512
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:08,480
Maybe you even hated, hated, had a problematic relation to that man or woman or whoever.

513
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,480
But all of a sudden you become aware, my God, really I am in love with him or her.

514
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,480
That's the structure of love.

515
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:26,480
And these are our deepest choices, which are precisely not experienced as simple free choices.

516
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:36,480
Love or sexual identity is not like going to a pâtisserie and oh my God, should I take cheesecake, strawberry cake or chocolate cake, you know.

517
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,480
No, you are chosen in some sense.

518
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:51,480
And the most radically free choices work like that, like something imposed on you, but freely imposed.

519
00:44:51,480 --> 00:45:00,480
Here again, I think we need today psychoanalysis, we need psychoanalysis more than ever.

520
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,480
I'm talking too much so I will cut it short.

521
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:10,480
No, because then you, my orangutan will not like me if I talk too much.

522
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,480
As long as we can later on, you know, like work on the hands.

523
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,480
Oh yeah, okay.

524
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,480
He is my type, you know.

525
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:26,480
I discovered that behind all his friendliness, deep in him, he can be very evil also.

526
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,480
And I think this is the whole, the hope today, you know.

527
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:37,480
We were sitting here just like half an hour ago and I said, we have a lot of things in common.

528
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,480
And we will come to that.

529
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,480
You know what I mean.

530
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:47,480
And now you are gradually coming out of yourself and telling me that I'm telling you, but you're telling me.

531
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,480
Yeah, that's a very good thing.

532
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:58,480
No, because, you know, once they asked me what makes a fool, if we can talk about this in today's confused time, a full normal human being.

533
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,480
I said three things.

534
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:10,480
First, here my metaphysical, dedication to some serious cause, socialism, whatever, freedom, ready to work, really for it.

535
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,480
Point two, some kind of good pragmatism.

536
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:20,480
There are people who are principled but enjoy being principled losers.

537
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,480
Many left this today.

538
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,480
They wait for the big revolution.

539
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,480
But whenever something happens, Syriza, they say, no, no, that's not yet it, you know.

540
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,480
No, let the others do it.

541
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,480
Let the others do it.

542
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,480
Let the others do it, yeah.

543
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,480
And there's the whole history of the left here.

544
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,480
How the European left after 68 is just looking.

545
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,480
At some point it was Cuba, Vietnam, Venezuela.

546
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,480
Now we are, no, the revolution takes place elsewhere.

547
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:53,480
We want here to enjoy our academic or work job and see the revolution there, you know.

548
00:46:53,480 --> 00:47:04,480
Like, what I wanted to say is that, let me go on.

549
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:10,480
Okay, I will just cover of these unholy alliances and catastrophe can save us.

550
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,480
Okay, another example of catastrophe can save us.

551
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:19,480
Something that worries me very, very much.

552
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,480
I cut off that line.

553
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,480
I know I said enough about LGBT plus and so on.

554
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,480
I wonder if you will agree with this.

555
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,480
A very intelligent critique from Bernie Sanders, my God.

556
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,480
Good old-fashioned American social democrat.

557
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,480
Where are my gloves?

558
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:38,480
Sorry?

559
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,480
Where are my gloves?

560
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,480
Yeah, yeah.

561
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,480
It's complicated.

562
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,480
I know, I know, I know.

563
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,480
No, no, no.

564
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,480
I just said that he noticed something.

565
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:52,480
You know what's my problem with a certain time of woke suspicion?

566
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,480
That the good old left at least pretended to be unifying.

567
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,480
You addressed the people.

568
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,480
You say we may have differences.

569
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,480
But let's say even peace, justice, better health.

570
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,480
Let's get all together.

571
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:18,480
Well, did you notice how the woke logic is on the contrary an extremely divisive logic of suspicion?

572
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:25,480
The first thing they note is, yeah, but the expression that you use there may be misunderstood in that way.

573
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,480
It's very sad.

574
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:43,480
That's why I think woke logic of this universal suspicion, where are traces of racism and so on, blocks solidari.

575
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,480
But let's not get long quickly to the end.

576
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:53,480
Another unholy alliance, what I already hinted at, I think Zionist anti-Semitism.

577
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,480
It's not a joke.

578
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:04,480
We have now at a very delicate level a strange alliance between the truly crazy Zionists,

579
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:10,480
those who now want to throw Arabs out of the West Bank.

580
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,480
You noticed what happened, I cried in Israel now.

581
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:31,480
For one terrorist act, they want a minister of finance of them proposed this to erase the entire city of 7,500 people and so on.

582
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,480
They speak openly about annexing and so on.

583
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:44,480
Okay, there are more problems here, but what I want to say is that, did you notice how this radical,

584
00:49:44,480 --> 00:50:03,480
zionist-Jews, who want strong Israel, are getting gradually into an unholy alliance with even anti-Semitic western conservatives, for example.

585
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:08,480
If there was somebody who was not really philosemitic, it was Donald Trump.

586
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:16,480
He was supported by a series of extreme right openly anti-Semitic organizations, but he supported Israel.

587
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,480
Now you will say, what's my point?

588
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,480
Now comes a bad surprise.

589
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,480
Not now looking to my books, I have a quote.

590
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,480
You know who is at the origin of this?

591
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,480
Reinhard Heidrich.

592
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:45,480
In 36 oder 7, he wrote a letter where he said, Jews are an ingenious, active people.

593
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,480
We would like to collaborate great with them, we just don't want them here.

594
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,480
We should help them to move to Palestine and so on.

595
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:04,480
And that's why, when Bibi Netanyahu some six, seven years ago called French Jews, come to Israel,

596
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,480
the right wing, really anti-Semitic circles celebrated it.

597
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,480
Yeah, yeah, you see, go there, go, just out of France, you know.

598
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:28,480
What makes me here so sad is, again, this weird alliance.

599
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,480
Then people tell me, but Jews suffered so much during the Holocaust.

600
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,480
I told them, no, this is an obscenity, what you are saying.

601
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:43,480
Because Arabs are saying the same thing, like some stupid pro-Palestinian,

602
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,480
not because he's pro-Palestinian, in Yubliana, in front of my house, did a graffiti.

603
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,480
If I were to live in Gaza, I would also deny Holocaust.

604
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,480
Like when you suffer, you know, this is totally wrong.

605
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:03,480
You know what is for me, I hope we'll agree, the only serious ethical position.

606
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:07,480
The struggle against anti-Semitism, unconditionally.

607
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:12,480
And the struggle for Palestinians, not the terrorists on the West Bank,

608
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,480
should be parts of the same struggle, point.

609
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,480
That's it.

610
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:26,480
That those who manipulate the memory of Holocaust to justify what Israel is today doing on the West Bank,

611
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,480
those are the true manipulators with Holocaust.

612
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:40,480
Because they use a mega-traumatical event to justify petty, colonizing land politics now.

613
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:48,480
You know who? I was asked at year 2000 an extremely stupid question. Naive.

614
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,480
Elaborate.

615
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,480
No, no, I have not elaborate too much, because then we can take a break, go to sleep and then come again.

616
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,480
Who is for you a true ethical, oh my God.

617
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,480
A true ethical hero of 20th century, I said Marek Edelman.

618
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,480
This was, remember the name, a Polish Jew, absolute hero.

619
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:17,480
He was Bundist there in Poland before World War II, fighting for workers rights, leftist.

620
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:22,480
He was among the coordinators of the Warsaw Ghetto Rebellion.

621
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,480
He somehow survived it.

622
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,480
He then organized that Warsaw uprising.

623
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:37,480
After the war, he remained there in Poland, although communists wanted to throw him out, with a beautiful argumentation.

624
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:49,480
He said, I see Auschwitz, stones there, and I think, I don't have anything to say that out of respect for the victims,

625
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:53,480
somebody has to be here to look at those stones.

626
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,480
And then shock.

627
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:03,480
In 67, 8, one of the last thing he did, he wrote a message to my Palestinian brothers.

628
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:10,480
He told them, as a Jew who went through all of it, I advise you, resist.

629
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,480
Not with terror, but resist, you have the right.

630
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,480
This is true ethics.

631
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:25,480
So, that we don't go on, just to conclude, I find the same problem with ecology.

632
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,480
You know, that's my philosophical trading.

633
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:34,480
You know how often I am totally again pro ecology.

634
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,480
But again, it's complex.

635
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:57,440
Eine Idee, die ich gewinnt, ist diesejenigekusche, die AWS noch Bil

636
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,360
Mögen wir die Umwelt so, dass wir in es leben können.

637
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,120
Das bedeutet, dass wir auf das fokussieren.

638
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,960
Es ist eine arrogantere Vision,

639
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,920
dass die Natur in sich ist irgendwie mehr harmonisch,

640
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,760
aber wir, Egotist, verabschieden die Menschen,

641
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,560
durch das Ausdruck.

642
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:19,360
Die erste Statement der true Eko-Equologisierung ist,

643
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,800
sorry, für dieses Volker-Statement, das hast du gehört,

644
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,480
ist, wenn die Natur unsere Mutter ist,

645
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:28,000
dass es eine dörfte Bitte ist, diese Mutter.

646
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:31,760
Eine Probe. Was ist unsere Hauptsache von Energie heute?

647
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,720
Öl, Kohle.

648
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,640
Kannst du dir sogar vorstellen,

649
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:40,200
was die Eko-Equologischen Katastrophen auf der Erde hatten,

650
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,680
bevor die Menschen entstanden waren,

651
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,120
dass wir alle diese Sorge von Energie haben?

652
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,360
Nein, die Natur ist schon in sich,

653
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,840
es ist nicht irgendwie ein harmonisches Zeichen, es ist die Erde.

654
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:55,480
Es ist sich selbst zerstört.

655
00:55:55,560 --> 00:56:00,200
Es ist nicht so, dass wir Menschen das aufgerissen.

656
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,480
Dann sind es so...

657
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,720
Eko-Equologen sind für mich ambiguous.

658
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:10,440
Ich bin wiederum absolut für sie, für alle measures und so.

659
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,720
Radical measures,

660
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:17,800
aber nicht in eine simple Ideologie zu fallen.

661
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,240
Was meinst du von diesem?

662
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,040
Oft, meine Freundin Alen Badiu,

663
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,640
der Freundin, hat das sehr gut entwickelt.

664
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:30,040
Heute haben wir ein Problem von der so-called Death of God.

665
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,960
Es gibt keine Autorität, die uns für uns unenttäuschbar ist,

666
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,480
wenn diese Autorität so ist, die wir nennen.

667
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,520
Wir relativisieren alles.

668
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:48,320
Und ich denke, dass die Eko-Equologen oft mit dieser Unkonditionale

669
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:55,640
in dem Sinne, dass wir die Natur haben, die uns ein Limit betrifft.

670
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,320
Nein, ich bin nicht bei diesem.

671
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,560
Ich denke, dass die Komplexität wiederum ist.

672
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,280
Was heute ein realer Problem ist,

673
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:08,600
ist, dass es nicht nur Natur ist, die verheiratet ist,

674
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:11,840
aber auch wir Menschen als Menschen.

675
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,880
Ich habe es in einem Buch geschrieben.

676
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,520
Vielleicht wissen Sie es, Hegel in einem wunderschönen Gehirn.

677
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,600
Ich habe versucht, das zu beurteilen.

678
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:27,040
Ich bin nicht so viel zufrieden von all diesen falschen Stufen,

679
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:29,120
obwohl wunderschöne Dinge passieren.

680
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,520
Jetzt komme ich zum Schluss.

681
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,320
Du weißt, dass, zum Beispiel,

682
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:39,040
siehst du, wie du diese face-swappen, hart-korpsen Poren hast?

683
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,040
Es ist sehr einfach.

684
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,680
Du nimmst einen hart-korpsen Poren,

685
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,720
und dann musst du nur ein paar Fotografen von einer Frau brauchen.

686
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,680
Dann putst du es in den Poren.

687
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,520
Dann hat der Computer das ganze Job.

688
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,480
Dann hast du das ganze Poren, das alles.

689
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:04,360
Du kannst mit jedem Poren einen hart-korpsen Poren machen,

690
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,680
mit dem du genug Fotos hast.

691
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,840
Ich habe mich eröffnet.

692
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,400
Ich habe es für die Tastungsmessung geöffnet.

693
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,960
Ich habe einen mit dem deutschen Poren-German,

694
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,040
eine Alena Baerbock gesehen.

695
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,240
Das ist so verrückt.

696
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,120
Es ist eine face-swapp.

697
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,000
Dann kannst du das mit...

698
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,720
Wir haben jetzt so perfekte Voizimitations.

699
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,560
Nein, dass du es komplett machen kannst.

700
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:34,200
So, vielleicht, zum Schluss,

701
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:39,560
wir kommen nahezu zu etwas, das ich fast findet, attraktiv.

702
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:44,240
Ich werde mit einem alten Schatz mit ein paar von dir, vielleicht nicht.

703
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:48,320
Der Guardian-German hat mir vor zehn Jahren gefragt,

704
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,920
ist Romanz heute noch alive?

705
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,880
Mein Antwort war schwierig, aber vielleicht.

706
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:01,520
Was wäre heute ein wirklich schönes Romantisches Sex-Geräusch?

707
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:07,120
Man hat ihn, die es so nennt, Völger.

708
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,360
Staminatraining-Unit.

709
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,600
In Deutschland nennt man es Wagenaror.

710
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,400
Eine Plastik, das ist wundervoll.

711
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,720
Man kann die Densität regulieren, wie man sie schrägst,

712
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,040
und dann die Penis.

713
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:24,080
Natürlich haben wir diese Dilde, die Plastik-Penis.

714
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,240
Die beiden arbeiten auf Elektrizität.

715
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,920
So, sagen wir, ich bin eine Frau, ich bin ein Mensch,

716
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,800
und wir sind keine Äpfel, und wir wollen Sex.

717
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,120
Würden Sie es nicht so tun?

718
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,400
Wenn du eine Frau mit deinem Dildo kommst,

719
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,800
dann kommst du mit meinem Wagenaror.

720
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,560
Wir sitzen runter, plaggen sie beide in.

721
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,840
Wir haben ein Dildo in einem Wagenaror.

722
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,600
Die Maschinen sind gebraucht.

723
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:49,960
Sie machen es für uns.

724
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:53,360
Wir sprechen über Philosophie, wie Wittgenstein.

725
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,520
Wir kennen beide die Wagenaroren, eigentlich.

726
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,280
Ja, wir können.

727
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:02,160
Ich möchte Sex mit dir haben, wenn du eine Frau bist.

728
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,160
Ich will die Maschinen, aber ich will die Äpfel.

729
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:09,760
Wollt ihr das heute ein wundervoller Ding machen?

730
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,360
Wir machen das Gleiche.

731
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,600
Wir nehmen einen richtig hohen Koppel in einem schweren Pferd,

732
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,800
und verabschieden die Fähigkeiten.

733
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,200
Und dann aufs Schreiben,

734
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,760
und haben einen schönen Trink, und reden, und so weiter.

735
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,800
Vielleicht ist das die Zukunft unserer Sexualität.

736
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:28,880
Vielleicht ist es.

737
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,960
Danke sehr, dass ich fertig bin.

738
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,160
Stopp!

739
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,240
Du siehst das.

740
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,880
Es muss discipline sein.

741
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,120
Bevor ich dir das Mikrofon hänge,

742
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:53,000
ich möchte ein bisschen nachfragen,

743
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:54,120
mit dem...

744
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,960
Das ist keine Ahnung, ob du mich wie ein Ablehst oder eine Frau bist.

745
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,320
Ich bin nicht ein Able, ich bin ein Peek.

746
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,400
Das Ding ist, du hast ein interessantes Wort gesagt,

747
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,320
weil wir so viel mit Technologien haben.

748
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,880
Und in einer Verabschiedung der popularen Quote von Nietzsche,

749
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,680
die lange du in den Abis klärst,

750
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,480
die Abis startet zu klären zu dir,

751
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,400
ist es nicht so, dass wir lange auf das Internet schauen,

752
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,480
dass das Internet zu uns sieht?

753
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:23,560
So, du denkst, dass wir schon beyond that point,

754
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:27,400
wo wir starten zu sprechen, um Katastrophen zu sprechen.

755
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:34,120
Dass wir uns die Maschine, die Web, alles so educieren,

756
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,080
oder du denkst, dass wir die Maschine schon passen,

757
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,720
wo wir uns educieren.

758
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:42,520
Und es ist so, dass es ein ganz neues Feld von Katastrophen

759
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,840
geht, das zu passieren.

760
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,920
Das ist eine sehr gute Frage,

761
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,560
für eine simple Dogmatik-Region,

762
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,600
weil es sehr Lacanian klingt.

763
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:53,760
Jacques Lacan hat diese Idee im Detail entwickelt,

764
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,840
die ist, glaube ich, sehr profund,

765
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,840
dass in dem Fall, um wirklich zu schauen,

766
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,320
in irgendeinem Sinne, das Ding hat zu schauen,

767
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,040
dich zurückzunehmen.

768
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:09,240
Und du hast das als den sogenannten blinden Spot im Film erlebt.

769
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:13,200
Der Punkt, als es dich zurückzunehmen.

770
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,960
Und ich denke, es ist eine spekulativen Theorie,

771
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:24,040
aber es kann auch sein, dass jedes Sex-Akt

772
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:31,360
fast auf einem tiefen, unkonservten Level

773
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,120
diese Idee des Voyages hat.

774
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:38,400
Wenn ich Sex genieße, genieße ich es nicht direkt.

775
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,440
Ich imagine, dass man von jemandem geobsert ist,

776
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:43,800
usw. usw.

777
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:47,080
Und es ist eine sehr gute Frage von dir.

778
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:51,640
Was passiert mit dieser Technologie,

779
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,000
in der es nicht mehr eine Fantasie ist?

780
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,080
Aber du bist wirklich geobsert,

781
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:00,160
alles ist bemerkt, usw.

782
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,000
Und meine kurze Antwort,

783
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,160
weil ich zu lange gesprochen habe,

784
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,240
ist, dass vielleicht was, was wir verlieren,

785
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:12,960
genau diese tiefen Metaphysikale schauen,

786
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,600
wie der andere die Geist zurückzunehmen.

787
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,560
Es ist nicht mehr dieses mysteriöse Sex,

788
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:22,880
wir sehen einfach, wo die Maschine wirklich auf uns schaut.

789
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,800
Das wäre meine kurze Antwort.

790
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,680
Meine zweite Antwort wäre,

791
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,320
dass du rememberst, dass du,

792
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:37,200
ein italienischer Typ etwas gemacht hast,

793
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,720
und ich mag es nicht, sorry,

794
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:44,120
es war ein endloses, artificiell generiertes Debatt

795
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,880
zwischen mir und Werner Herzog.

796
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:51,080
Du kannst es endlöschen.

797
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,560
Ich hatte einen Verkauf mit dir.

798
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,760
Du hast den letzten Stück der Schokolade, ich glaube.

799
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,400
Ja, und ich habe ihm gesagt,

800
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,000
my God, listen,

801
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:05,120
couldn't you, like, I'm too fluent there,

802
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,200
there are none of my dirty tics,

803
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,640
none of my vulgarities and so on.

804
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,000
Couldn't you include, so,

805
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:17,080
the real problem with computers imitating us

806
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,440
or controlling us is,

807
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:23,200
the greatest thing about our human speech,

808
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,480
you know who knew this, didn't Kleist,

809
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,320
Heinrich von Kleist, wrote a wonderful,

810
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:34,880
a couple of pages short essay on Iber-Einige,

811
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,240
I don't know, von Benjamin,

812
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:39,640
where his idea is that all great inventions

813
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:44,040
in language ideas happened so that you misspoke.

814
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,880
You say something wrongly,

815
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:48,440
and then you try to save the situation

816
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,960
and try to include that.

817
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,560
Can computers do this?

818
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,480
I'm not so sure.

819
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:55,520
No, we're not either, but it's a good thing,

820
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,600
because as we talk about this failure

821
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,960
and these things that happen,

822
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,880
and then we try to cope with that,

823
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,040
brings us back to the topic of tonight,

824
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,880
and your title of your lecture,

825
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,920
like Catastrophe with Savers,

826
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,480
because what Kleist says in languages,

827
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:15,320
a little catastrophe happens

828
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,200
and something good comes out of it.

829
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,120
Isn't it that?

830
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,280
Even today, sorry, just to finish.

831
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,160
No, no, it's interesting.

832
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:26,360
That's why many Jewish friends are telling me,

833
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,800
you know this catastrophe now,

834
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,960
colonizing the West Bank,

835
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,920
direct racism, and so on.

836
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,440
It's not just hypocrisy,

837
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,960
when white liberal Jews are protesting it,

838
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:41,920
but this was such a shock

839
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,040
for the majority of half-Eight-Eys.

840
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:47,000
What I like about Jews is that, you know,

841
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:50,760
they have the greatest percentage of Eight-Eys in the world.

842
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,560
The Jews.

843
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,680
And it's this wonderful paradox,

844
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,600
as a Jew once told me,

845
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,000
we don't believe in God,

846
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,080
but nonetheless, we believe that God gave us the land.

847
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,560
We don't believe in God,

848
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,200
but we know that God believes in us.

849
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:05,080
Yes, yes.

850
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,160
Now you said something so profound,

851
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:12,000
that I'm just said that we cannot go on indefinitely,

852
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:16,520
because I think Jacques Lacan says this.

853
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,400
The true methodical question

854
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,640
is not do we believe in God.

855
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:26,200
Some people do, some not, who cares.

856
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,040
The problem is, does God,

857
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:31,240
God is our fantasy formation,

858
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,400
does God believe in himself?

859
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:38,640
And the answer of all truly profound theology is no.

860
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,040
No.

861
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,640
The problem is there.

862
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,880
The problem is there.

863
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,920
The problem is that we made him up.

864
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,120
Yeah, but what does he...

865
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:52,240
Which is why I have another theory,

866
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,480
I wonder if you like it.

867
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,200
The most hit me, the most materialist film that I saw,

868
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,760
I've written about it, is downloaded, you get it.

869
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:07,400
Rapture, 25, 30 years old film with,

870
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,480
when she was younger, Mimi Rogers.

871
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:12,000
It's an incredible story,

872
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,400
I will condense it as much as possible.

873
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,760
An ordinary, short short short, an ordinary girl,

874
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,680
okay, he's promiscuous, then she falls in love,

875
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,360
her husband dies, he has a children,

876
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,000
and she has an obsession

877
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:32,200
that God will in Rapture call her up.

878
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:35,480
So, she goes to a desert near Los Angeles,

879
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:39,400
to a desert to wait for God.

880
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:43,160
God doesn't do, does nothing.

881
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:46,920
So, she kills her daughter, nothing.

882
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,200
Then she is arrested for this, now comes the miracle.

883
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,320
She goes, till this point, and is arrested.

884
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,680
Till that, this point, the movie is realistic.

885
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,680
Could have happened, a disappointed, crazy believer.

886
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,880
Then, the miracle happens.

887
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,440
It's the end of the world, all of a sudden,

888
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,680
the walls disintegrate of the prison,

889
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:13,520
she takes a car, she goes to somewhere,

890
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:19,040
to the edge of the world, where she sees up there, Paradise.

891
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:22,160
And the ending, it's incredible.

892
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:25,160
There, from the other side of Paradise,

893
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:29,600
her dead husband and daughter approach her,

894
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:32,760
and ask her, mommy, come to us,

895
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:36,680
you just have to say, I love you God.

896
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:39,320
And she said, no, I will not.

897
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,200
After God did, what God did to me,

898
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:44,400
with all these miracles, no.

899
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:48,640
And then, her daughter said, but mommy, you know what this means.

900
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,600
You know how long you will stay there.

901
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,760
And she says, I know, forever.

902
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,400
This is the end.

903
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:01,840
That's the true undermining of religion from within.

904
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,560
Much better than this, God doesn't exist.

905
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,680
Because when people say God doesn't exist,

906
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:10,560
they usually mean, but nonetheless, it's a noble idea, you know.

907
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,000
Like, I talk too much, please.

908
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,800
No, two things.

909
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,800
First, this reminds me a little bit,

910
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,960
in a very abstract way of the story of Lilium, from Mourna,

911
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:25,320
you know, the play, the play of Lilium.

912
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:26,320
Are you familiar with that?

913
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,320
No, I'm not.

914
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,960
We'll talk about it later, when we work on the hands.

915
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,000
And the good thing about the film or the movie

916
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,600
is that you can make it like a really hard cut.

917
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,600
So we make a hard cut now,

918
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:40,440
because I promise the people that they can ask you questions.

919
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:42,680
And we've got another 15 minutes running.

920
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,240
Okay?

921
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,640
And I will try to be stupid enough to believe me.

922
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,720
I will try to be...

923
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,080
The good thing is you are straight to the point,

924
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,440
you're not very elaborate, you have straight answers,

925
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:54,720
very short, it's a very good thing.

926
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,200
But you are right in something.

927
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,280
I know, I know.

928
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:03,880
The great art in books, in films, is the proper cut at the end.

929
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:05,520
Did you see the new Spielberg?

930
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:07,720
And I don't like it very much, Fableman.

931
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,800
Yes.

932
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,600
The ending with John Ford is one of the best endings of all the time.

933
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:15,560
At now, the fuck get out of my office.

934
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:16,640
Yes.

935
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,720
Bitte.

936
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:18,800
Bitte.

937
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:21,280
You know what song I will think about you.

938
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,360
No.

939
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:23,840
You are Sebastian.

940
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:24,920
Yes, yes.

941
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Somebody call me Sebastian.

942
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,080
No, no, no, no, no, no.

943
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:32,760
You know, do you know the old De Deer from early fifties?

944
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:36,520
Pro Stalin song, Stalin Freund Genosse.

945
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,600
Very good.

946
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,720
Thank you, Sebastian Freund Genosse.

947
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,800
Okay.

948
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,640
And the song that I will sing for you from the De Deer

949
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:46,120
is Sag mir wo du stehst.

950
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,200
I know, but this was a pop song.

951
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,280
Yes, it was.

952
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,360
Questions.

953
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:51,440
Bitte.

954
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,000
I already criticized him.

955
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,080
I told him as a true Stalinist,

956
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:59,000
did you organize the questions?

957
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,080
Yes, of course.

958
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,440
They are all censored.

959
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,520
Come on.

960
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,600
Of course.

961
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:05,480
The nomen Katura is watching.

962
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,080
Bitte.

963
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:12,160
Sie können, wenn Sie wollen, auch auf Deutsch die Frage spielen.

964
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:15,360
Ja, ich hoffe, das ist okay, sehr geehrter Herr Schischek.

965
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:19,080
Ich hätte zwei kurze Fragen, und zwar zuerst.

966
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:21,960
Sie haben das ja näher ausgeführt,

967
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:25,240
diese unheilige Allianz zwischen Wagenknecht,

968
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,880
den Linken und der AfD, etc.

969
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,360
Aber wenn man sich die andere Seite anschaut,

970
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:32,640
also ich würde jetzt mal sagen, viele Linksliberale,

971
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:35,080
die sagen, es braucht Waffenlieferungen ohne Ende,

972
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:39,200
die schon diskutieren über eine Flugverbotszone, etc.

973
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,280
Ich stecke da nicht auch eine gewisse Ideologie dahinter,

974
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:46,360
dass man den Krieg und den Toten das Leid als etwas Virtuelles betrachtet.

975
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:49,440
Man diskutiert darüber und denkt nicht über die Konsequenzen

976
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,840
und auch nicht darüber, dass Russen genauso sterben wie Ukrainer.

977
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,720
Und ob da, meiner Meinung nach,

978
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,120
ein bisschen diese Struktur der fetischistischen Verleugnung dahinter steckt.

979
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,200
Ich weiß, dass da ein Krieg herrscht,

980
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:04,120
aber ich tue es so, als ob es diesen ganzen Toten so nicht geben würde.

981
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,680
Und was Sie dazu sagen?

982
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,240
Und meine zweite Frage wäre,

983
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:13,160
wo sehen Sie die Rolle der Philosophie in den ganzen Krisen?

984
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:16,840
Irgendwie habe ich das Gefühl, jetzt in der Pandemie hat man sehr viel,

985
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,840
da gab es nicht viel Platz für Philosophie.

986
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:24,320
Er wurde mit virologischen Grundbegriffen argumentiert

987
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,640
und jetzt im Krieg auch sehr viel mit militärischen Begriffen.

988
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,320
Jetzt ist er, wie Sie erwähnt haben, Jürgen Habermas,

989
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:34,440
ist auch oft angegriffen worden, für das, was er geschrieben hat,

990
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,040
Alexander Kluge auch.

991
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:39,880
Wo ist da die Rolle der Philosophie im Sinne einer Intervention?

992
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:40,960
Danke.

993
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,560
Vielen Dank. Danke.

994
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,920
Ich hoffe, dass ich die Frage richtig verstanden hat.

995
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Die erste Frage.

996
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:51,720
Yes, I totally agree again.

997
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:56,000
As I already said, I can give you a whole list of crazy things

998
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,560
that Ukrainians were and are doing.

999
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:04,880
But nonetheless, I will tell you one thing.

1000
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,080
First, I don't buy this argument

1001
01:13:09,160 --> 01:13:15,160
that it's really a proxy war between United States and Russia

1002
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:19,040
and that it's just to support our military industry.

1003
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:24,000
Tell this to an Ukrainian and he will explode.

1004
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:29,320
And justly, he will say, do you think that we are so stupid

1005
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:33,240
that we said to ourselves we could have lived in peace?

1006
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:36,320
But wait a minute, why don't we sacrifice ourselves

1007
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,720
to support the western military industry?

1008
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:44,240
For them it's not a proxy war, they fight for their survival.

1009
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,200
Russia is openly saying,

1010
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:50,320
Ukrainian nation doesn't exist and so on and so on.

1011
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,760
I know I didn't really, but what I like very much

1012
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,480
is this how you applied to this also,

1013
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,160
that logic didn't understand you correctly,

1014
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,920
is vice-versaulter.

1015
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,480
Because this, I think, is something absolutely crucial

1016
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,400
that's happening today.

1017
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,920
This formula, as we well know,

1018
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:17,520
is the formula of, again, feticist disavable.

1019
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,920
I know very well, but I don't really believe it.

1020
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,480
I act as if and so on.

1021
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,480
But today, I plagiarize here, my good friend,

1022
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,880
you should invite her here, I envy and hate her.

1023
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:33,800
This means love, because she is very bright.

1024
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,840
I don't want to talk about it, maybe more bright than me.

1025
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,440
Alenka Zupancic, my streaming colleague,

1026
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:44,600
and she developed that today, it's not just that,

1027
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:49,920
you know something, but at the same time,

1028
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:54,120
you don't take it seriously, ignore it.

1029
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:59,920
No, it's that the fetish becomes your knowledge itself.

1030
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,680
I will give you an example.

1031
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,600
How I claim more and more,

1032
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:06,920
we live in an absolutely cynical era,

1033
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,360
where the official ideology situation

1034
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:18,080
can only reproduce itself by, in some sense, limited,

1035
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:22,720
saying the truth about itself and doing nothing.

1036
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,320
You know, I will give you, to make it clear,

1037
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,360
what I mean, two examples that I like.

1038
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:31,760
First, I hate this, Castle Biennale, Benedict Biennale,

1039
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,360
because I look at the program, they always say,

1040
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,120
even we are caught in capitalist game,

1041
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,840
it's all colonial exploitation.

1042
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:44,040
Yeah, they say this, but they function perfectly.

1043
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,000
They are playing this capitalist game.

1044
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,640
And why can't they play it?

1045
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:50,040
Because they proclaim it, you know.

1046
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:54,280
This is a new version of this old Peter Slaughter Dykes,

1047
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,400
his early work, maybe still the best,

1048
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,680
critique the Chinese and Fernund,

1049
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:04,120
where he defines it as the vision turning around Marx.

1050
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:07,000
Yeah, reflection used for Sanction, yeah.

1051
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,120
We know very well what we are doing,

1052
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,120
but we are nonetheless doing it.

1053
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,200
The second example is, I really hate it.

1054
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,880
You remember, it's now two years ago already in Glasgow, I think,

1055
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:23,120
that big meeting of Prince Charles was there,

1056
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:27,040
everybody for fight against global war.

1057
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,080
Global war in conference.

1058
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:29,120
Yeah, conference.

1059
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:31,680
And they were saying all the right things,

1060
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,840
but it works like, okay, now we said it,

1061
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,000
now we can go on as usual.

1062
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,000
So this mechanism, I'm sorry, I shouldn't talk too much,

1063
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:44,440
but this is absolutely a crucial mechanism

1064
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,840
which works in different ways.

1065
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:54,000
What you said about Chris' pandemic philosophy,

1066
01:16:54,080 --> 01:17:00,320
I must say that, maybe I speak now in an egotist way

1067
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,360
for saving my own profession,

1068
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:07,840
but in some sense we live in a time

1069
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,400
when philosophy is needed more than ever.

1070
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,480
Why?

1071
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:17,680
Because in the confusion in which we are today,

1072
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:23,880
like, and confusion which concerns even everyday people,

1073
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,440
you know, like Havremas, I don't agree with his solution,

1074
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,520
but he raised the right question,

1075
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,520
where he said, do we have the right to mix with our brains?

1076
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:40,360
Yes, because then we may manipulate our psychic properties

1077
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,360
and so on and so on.

1078
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,120
But this is a problem for all of us.

1079
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,600
I read somewhere, it's a horrible vision,

1080
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,560
so horrible that I almost like it,

1081
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:51,520
that now a guy with some Arab name

1082
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,640
is opening a big clinic in Berlin,

1083
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:59,280
where you will have a perfect reproduction of not vagina,

1084
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,320
but how do you call this inside?

1085
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:02,400
Uterus.

1086
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,400
Uterus.

1087
01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:04,480
Transparent.

1088
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:10,160
And you want to have with your wife, partner, a child.

1089
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:14,920
You just give experiment with the feminine counterpart

1090
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,320
and you do nothing.

1091
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:21,640
Then you just fill out the form, they give you 200 choices.

1092
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:25,280
How to manipulate before, even starting the process,

1093
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,760
experiment so on, like choice of color,

1094
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:32,360
color of the eye, like brown or the blue.

1095
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:33,440
Ja, ja.

1096
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,240
All that stuff, intelligence and hate and so on.

1097
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:39,000
Hate, I mean, how not hate?

1098
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,080
Ja, hate.

1099
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,160
Hight.

1100
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:42,240
Sorry.

1101
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,320
Hot hall.

1102
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:44,400
Yes.

1103
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:48,320
And then they produce the child and their hope is that...

1104
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,640
So, you know, all these things

1105
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:57,400
and basically already the abortion debate

1106
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:01,280
confronts us with some basic philosophical problems,

1107
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:04,720
like what are we as humans, when do we exist as humans.

1108
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,400
We live in a time of ethical confusion,

1109
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:12,360
where even everyday decisions

1110
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:17,680
demand from us a kind of spontaneous,

1111
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:22,680
basically philosophical decision.

1112
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:25,680
You know, like the use again.

1113
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:28,480
Habermas was right, but I don't think the solution is right.

1114
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:32,400
When he said that when we will be able to do,

1115
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,160
that's the big task now,

1116
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:38,760
to somehow implant vision, knowledge in our mind,

1117
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:45,080
either through sleep, hypnosis or other way without doing ourselves.

1118
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,840
What does this mean for our whole concept of education?

1119
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:53,280
Let's say you are much more honest and bright than me.

1120
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,440
But I get the proper pills, manipulations

1121
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:59,960
and I can be more efficient than you.

1122
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:01,640
What happens with ours?

1123
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:04,720
Isn't it a wonderful vision that Stanislav Lamm already wrote up

1124
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,400
in the photo-rological Congress?

1125
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:11,920
That we take pills and then we virtualize our whole existence.

1126
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,080
Isn't that happening right now already?

1127
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:18,640
Like we translate ourselves much more in images than in writing.

1128
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:22,080
Like all the social media, much more like an image media

1129
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:23,840
than a written media.

1130
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,880
I agree, that's why, but we don't have time for this.

1131
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:33,080
That's why I much prefer Lamm's novel than Stalker the film.

1132
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,000
Yeah, me too.

1133
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,840
Novel is... Sorry, Solaris already.

1134
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:38,440
Solaris, Solaris, not Stalker.

1135
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:45,920
In the film, Tarkowski does the usual half-religious obsturantism.

1136
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:51,000
The object is just a mirror of the deepest desires of our soul.

1137
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:56,480
In Lamm's novel became a traumatic, external object

1138
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,120
which simply remains non-transparent.

1139
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,680
We know they are doing something with us,

1140
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:06,840
but we never learn at the end what.

1141
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:10,680
So, okay, let's not lose time.

1142
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:17,520
What I am just saying is that precisely every great philosophy

1143
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:23,120
always happens in the time of a crisis.

1144
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,160
Huge crisis.

1145
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:24,880
Sorry?

1146
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:25,680
Huge crisis, huge crisis.

1147
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,720
Plato, Aristotle, it's the end of Polish.

1148
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,520
It's already the decadence of Polish.

1149
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,800
And Hegel was quite aware.

1150
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:38,160
The new boost of philosophy from Kant to Hegel and later

1151
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:44,360
comes with the problems of Aufklärung and French Revolution.

1152
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:48,240
So, when with terror and so on, things went wrong, then...

1153
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,360
So, we need the crisis.

1154
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:49,840
Sorry?

1155
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,480
We need the crisis.

1156
01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:54,040
To think properly, absolutely.

1157
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:58,280
I don't believe that to be a philosopher, you need peaceful time.

1158
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:01,600
No, true philosophy is for the times of emergency.

1159
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:06,160
But Kant, peaceful times, if it's so peaceful and you have no challenge at all,

1160
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:09,120
can be a great burden by itself as well.

1161
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:10,080
Absolutely.

1162
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:10,800
So, maybe...

1163
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,440
I'm afraid of this, absolutely.

1164
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:15,880
I mean, I cannot even...

1165
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:19,400
I'm an absolute workaholic, even tonight,

1166
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:22,440
because I was not able to do my work.

1167
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:24,000
I go back to Ljubljana and...

1168
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,600
And you finish it.

1169
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:26,960
Two hours minimum.

1170
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,000
It's very important to have a regime.

1171
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:29,520
Absolutely.

1172
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,560
Keeps you going.

1173
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:31,960
Because you need a task in life.

1174
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:37,280
I will end with a few obscenities, but take it friendly.

1175
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,840
It's not a bad joke.

1176
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:42,040
When a journalist asked me what's your favorite motto,

1177
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,360
I said, Arbeit macht frei.

1178
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:47,840
And then, of course, I said, I don't mean it in that way.

1179
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,320
But the Nazis brutally misused it.

1180
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:55,320
That work certainly didn't make you free.

1181
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:58,760
But the horror of the Nazis is that a motto,

1182
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:03,760
which is for me at least in itself a good one, free one,

1183
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:09,200
they misused it in the most horrible, imaginable way.

1184
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,440
But it's always like that.

1185
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:14,280
Sovereignty of interpretation means you control

1186
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:16,480
how you propagandize for things.

1187
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:22,040
So, but that's why I believe in failure, in mistakes, in mis-speaking.

1188
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:25,160
That's the only way, even in love.

1189
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:30,440
Don't you agree that when you declare love,

1190
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:33,480
this is for me the most traumatic moment always,

1191
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,760
when you declare love to somebody,

1192
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:41,200
if you don't do it with some oscillation, stumbling,

1193
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:42,800
there is something wrong.

1194
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,240
It means you are perfectly trained to do it.

1195
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,160
Did you see a stupid movie, otherwise I hated it,

1196
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:51,440
for weddings and the funeral.

1197
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:56,000
But there is a nice detail that when Hugh Grant declares love

1198
01:23:56,080 --> 01:24:00,360
to Andy McDowell, he gets in his typical way,

1199
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,880
stumbles, repeats himself, that's how you declare love.

1200
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:10,800
So, the thing is, we reached the end, unfortunately.

1201
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,440
I want to ask you one last question.

1202
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:15,960
Will I kill myself?

1203
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:19,040
No, with the challenge attached to it,

1204
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:22,000
that you have to answer it really shortly.

1205
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:25,160
And we see, and if you can suffice,

1206
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:28,960
you were talking about the role of philosophy nowadays times,

1207
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,720
and we are very challenging times.

1208
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:34,400
So, do you generally, like, it's more like a yes or no question,

1209
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:39,760
do you generally think that the biggest challenge is

1210
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:46,640
that we live in times where we have a lot of reflexes,

1211
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,280
to counter stuff that is coming to us.

1212
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:54,640
And especially in times when there is a high pressure of reflex,

1213
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:59,120
that we should take our time to reflect instead of just reflex.

1214
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,360
Absolutley.

1215
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:05,880
This is why, to annoy many of my leftist friends,

1216
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:11,080
maybe you know it, this is my standard answer,

1217
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:14,200
like is Marxist-Physis XI.

1218
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:18,680
Philosophers have only interpreted the world, we have to change it.

1219
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:21,520
I claim that it's a correct phrase for today,

1220
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,320
just we should turn it around.

1221
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:28,120
In the 20th century, we wanted to change the world too fast,

1222
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:30,200
now we need to interpret it more.

1223
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,280
Exactly.

1224
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:37,560
Never were we so epistemologically, with our knowledge, disorientated.

1225
01:25:37,640 --> 01:25:41,720
I ask you a simple question, what is China today?

1226
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:44,960
It's still communism, it's authoritarian capitalism.

1227
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:48,800
The basic orientation is missing.

1228
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:50,400
We have to finish now.

1229
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,680
Ladies and gentlemen, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren,

1230
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:55,120
danke, dass Sie sich so aufmerksam zugehört haben.

1231
01:25:55,120 --> 01:26:00,480
Ich würde sagen, Genossen und Genossinnen.

1232
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,480
Fertig, danke.

1233
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,560
Danke.

1234
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,640
Das war ein Pleasure.

1235
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:19,560
Stop! Stop!

1236
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:23,640
Weil mit mir, du hast immer den Preis gespielt.

1237
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,160
Seit du das Applaus hast,

1238
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:29,240
werde ich dir eine wundervolle, dörrige Joke sagen.

1239
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,640
Das ist...

1240
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:31,720
Ja, ja.

1241
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,880
Wir müssen auf die Hände arbeiten.

1242
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,960
Du musst auf die Hände arbeiten.

1243
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:39,040
Nein, nein, aber eine dörrige Joke,

1244
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:42,680
die philosophisch korrekt ist.

1245
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:47,720
Eine starke Frau schenkt ihr Mann in der Sonne,

1246
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:52,040
und bringt mir ein paar Zigaretten aus der Trafik auf die Strecke.

1247
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:55,040
Der Mann geht raus, die Trafik ist zu nahe.

1248
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:59,960
Er geht zu einer Bar, um die Zigaretten zu kaufen.

1249
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:03,720
Da beginnt ein schönes Wetter, sie flirren.

1250
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,600
Sie enden in ihrer Fläche,

1251
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:08,800
schlug wie ein verrückter Tiltrin im Morgen.

1252
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,400
Dann sagt er, oh mein Gott, ich muss nach Hause.

1253
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:13,280
Was will ich zu meiner Frau sagen?

1254
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,920
Und er findet eine Lösung.

1255
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,240
Er sagt zu der Frau,

1256
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:21,000
ob du eine dieser, wenn du einen Puder machen willst,

1257
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:24,320
okay, eine Bohlinge für Bohlinge.

1258
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:27,440
Okay, er setzt das an und geht nach Hause.

1259
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,800
Be careful for the dialectic now.

1260
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,400
Die Frau fragt ihm, wo war du?

1261
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,600
Sucht eine lange Zeit.

1262
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:38,560
Und er sagt, ich bin raus, die Trafik war zu nahe.

1263
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:41,080
Ich bin zu einer Bar, ich habe mit einer Frau geflirtet,

1264
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,000
wir haben ein verrückter Tiltrin.

1265
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,400
Und du weißt, was ist der Effekt?

1266
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:48,440
Die Frau sagt, warum bist du so miserably lieb mit mir?

1267
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:49,640
Ich sehe die Puder,

1268
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,800
du warst mit deinen Freunden Bohlinge.

1269
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,280
Das ist die politische Art,

1270
01:27:55,360 --> 01:27:57,640
um die Wahrheit zu erzählen,

1271
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:00,000
in eine Weise, die die Enemene zu confusieren.

1272
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,640
Das ist für mich.

1273
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,600
Professor, Dr. Slavo Shisha.

1274
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,280
Danke.

1275
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,360
Danke.

1276
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,600
