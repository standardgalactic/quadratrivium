 In this conversation, Slavo Škoda, a philosopher and comedian, discusses the importance of reflection over reflex in our fast-paced world. He emphasizes that while the 20th century was about changing the world rapidly, our current challenge is to understand it better. He points out that we are more epistemologically disoriented now than ever before and uses China as an example of a place whose basic orientation remains uncertain.

Towards the end, Škoda shares a humorous anecdote to illustrate his point about the dialectic. A man goes out for cigarettes during a beautiful day while his wife waits in bed. After an encounter with a woman at a bar, he returns home and cleverly uses a carpenter's level as an excuse for his behavior when questioned by his wife. The story serves to demonstrate how one can truthfully communicate without directly lying, a political art of telling the truth that confuses opponents.

The conversation concludes with Škoda humorously addressing the audience, joking about the applause and the nature of his work as a thinker and comedian. He thanks the audience and wraps up the event. The subtitles were produced by ZDF in 2017.
