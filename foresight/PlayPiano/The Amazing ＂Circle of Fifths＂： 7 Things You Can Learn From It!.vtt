00:00.000 --> 00:07.520
Hi, this is Dwayne, and today I'd like to talk about the amazing circle of keys.

00:07.520 --> 00:12.560
The circle of keys is also known sometimes as the circle of fifths or the circle of

00:12.560 --> 00:13.560
fourths.

00:13.560 --> 00:17.200
But when people talk about those, they're talking about the very same thing.

00:17.200 --> 00:21.800
The circle of keys is the same thing as the circle of fifths or the circle of fourths.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.960
And there's all kinds of exciting things you can learn from that, and I'd like to talk

00:24.960 --> 00:28.680
about seven of them today.

00:28.680 --> 00:32.560
The first thing I'd like to talk about is the order of the sharps.

00:32.560 --> 00:37.920
You can learn the order of the sharps as they occur in music.

00:37.920 --> 00:43.520
In other words, if there's a key signature and you see one sharp, that sharp is always

00:43.520 --> 00:45.120
right there, f, okay?

00:45.120 --> 00:46.440
You can count on that.

00:46.440 --> 00:50.800
If there's two sharps, the key signature is always f and c sharp, okay?

00:50.800 --> 00:52.680
Two sharps, f and c sharp.

00:52.680 --> 00:56.400
Three are f, c, and g.

00:56.400 --> 01:00.320
If you have four sharps, I bet you know what the fourth one will be, right?

01:00.320 --> 01:03.480
You'd have f, c, g, d.

01:03.480 --> 01:07.360
If you have five sharps, of course, it's f, c, g, d, and a.

01:07.360 --> 01:11.480
And notice these relationships.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.000
There are fifths apart.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.020
C is five notes higher than f.

01:15.020 --> 01:17.160
If you look at the keyboard, you'll see that.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.960
G is five notes higher than c.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.200
D is five notes higher than g.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.920
A is five notes higher than d.

01:24.920 --> 01:27.880
And the next sharp, therefore, would be e.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.420
And the next sharp would be b.

01:30.420 --> 01:32.560
And the next sharp would be f sharp.

01:32.560 --> 01:42.000
So if you had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven sharps, you would have, oh, I'm

01:42.000 --> 01:44.200
sorry, I already named f sharp, didn't I?

01:44.200 --> 01:45.200
Okay.

01:45.200 --> 01:50.120
If you had seven sharps, you'd have f, c, g, d, a, e, b.

01:50.120 --> 01:55.360
If you have seven flats, the order of the seven flats is just opposite from the order

01:55.360 --> 01:56.360
of the sharps.

01:56.360 --> 02:00.480
In other words, if you have one flat, it's always b-flat.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.280
If you have two flats, it's b-flat and e-flat.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.120
Three flats, b-flat, e-flat, a-flat.

02:06.120 --> 02:10.240
Four flats spell the word b, b-e-a-d, okay?

02:10.240 --> 02:13.360
Five flats would be g-flat.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.400
Six flats would be c-flat.

02:15.400 --> 02:21.280
It looks like b is printed there, but inharmonically, it would be c-flat.

02:21.280 --> 02:27.080
And seven flats would be f-flat, inharmonic with e, but don't call it e, call it f-flat,

02:27.080 --> 02:28.080
okay?

02:28.080 --> 02:32.240
So, that's the first thing you can learn is the order of the sharps.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.840
Second thing is the order of the flats.

02:33.840 --> 02:39.520
That third thing you can learn from this circle is the relationship of keys, the related keys.

02:39.520 --> 02:44.600
If you're on the key of c, it's most likely, I mean, it's most closely related to the key

02:44.600 --> 02:47.320
of f because there's only one difference.

02:47.320 --> 02:51.360
The key of c has no sharps or flats, and the key of f has one flat.

02:51.360 --> 02:56.680
So, the only difference between the key of c and the key of f is that one flat.

02:56.680 --> 03:01.080
And we already learned that one flat is always b-flat, okay?

03:01.080 --> 03:03.720
C is also closely related to the key of g.

03:03.720 --> 03:04.720
Why?

03:04.720 --> 03:08.360
Because there's only one difference, the sharp and the key of g, which is f-sharp, which

03:08.360 --> 03:10.760
we already learned, okay?

03:10.760 --> 03:15.840
There's two differences between the key of c and the key of d, and you know by now those

03:15.840 --> 03:18.360
are the two sharps.

03:18.360 --> 03:23.800
There's two differences between the key of c and the key of b-flat, the two flats in

03:23.800 --> 03:26.240
the key of b-flat, all right?

03:26.240 --> 03:27.240
And so on.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.520
Three differences between the key of c and the key of b-flat.

03:29.520 --> 03:35.440
So, the most closely related keys to one another are the ones that are closest on this circle.

03:35.440 --> 03:39.960
In other words, if you're in the key of e, what are the most closely related keys to

03:39.960 --> 03:40.960
you?

03:40.960 --> 03:44.880
Right, the key of a, the key of b.

03:44.880 --> 03:51.040
The next most likely would be the key of d or the key of f-sharp, okay?

03:51.040 --> 03:57.640
So, either move left or right on the circle, and those are the most closely related keys.

03:57.640 --> 04:01.480
I'm kind of going fast here because I want to cover all seven here at a limited time,

04:01.480 --> 04:07.800
so let's move on to the next thing that the circle of keys relate, and that's the primary

04:07.800 --> 04:08.960
chords.

04:08.960 --> 04:14.040
If you're in the key of c, the primary chords or the most used chords in the key of c are

04:14.040 --> 04:21.680
c, g, and f, in other words, the key itself, the key note itself plus the ones on the right

04:21.680 --> 04:24.160
and on the left, okay?

04:24.160 --> 04:25.160
Those are the most used chords.

04:25.160 --> 04:29.280
So, if you're in the key of b-flat, what are the most used chords?

04:29.280 --> 04:35.000
The most used chords in the key of b-flat are f and e-flat, to the left or right, okay?

04:35.000 --> 04:37.840
If you're in the key of a-flat, what are the most used chords?

04:37.840 --> 04:40.760
Right, a-flat, e-flat, and d-flat.

04:40.760 --> 04:44.320
If you're in the key of d, what do you think the most used chords are?

04:44.320 --> 04:50.280
Right, the key a-chord and the g-chord, the most used chords, okay?

04:50.280 --> 04:51.840
They don't have to happen, but they do.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.040
If you dumped all the songs that have ever been written in a computer, those would come

04:55.040 --> 04:56.280
out.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.280
Those three would come out.

04:57.280 --> 04:58.600
They're called the primary chords.

04:58.600 --> 05:02.000
They're primary because they're indigenous to that key.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.080
And I won't get into explaining why, but they are, okay?

05:06.080 --> 05:11.120
The next thing you can learn from the circle of keys are secondary chords.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.160
We learned about primary chords right there, okay?

05:14.160 --> 05:18.000
That the primary chords are to the left and right.

05:18.000 --> 05:26.080
Well, the secondary chords after the primary chords are the next three, basically three

05:26.080 --> 05:29.600
could be four, to the left of whatever key you're in.

05:29.600 --> 05:33.460
In other words, the primary chords in the key of c are c, f, and g, but the secondary

05:33.460 --> 05:36.480
chords are d, a, and e.

05:36.480 --> 05:40.800
And that's the most likely the order in which they'll happen, too.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.640
In other words, if you're in the key of c, after the g-chord and the f-chord, the next

05:44.640 --> 05:47.160
most likely chord is the d-chord.

05:47.160 --> 05:50.440
The next most likely chord after that in the key of c is a-chord.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.600
The next most likely chord after that is the e-chord.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.800
The next most likely chord is the b-chord.

05:54.800 --> 05:59.440
And the least likely chord is f-chord, or chief left, of course, okay?

05:59.440 --> 06:06.240
So you can always move to the left to find out the secondary chords.

06:06.240 --> 06:12.640
The sixth thing you can learn from the circle of keys are chord progressions, the way chords

06:12.640 --> 06:13.960
want to move.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.920
And chords generally want to move up a fourth.

06:17.920 --> 06:22.880
Quite often they don't always, of course, but you can count most of the time that they'll

06:22.880 --> 06:24.080
move up a fourth.

06:24.080 --> 06:29.520
Quite often, probably, you know, 60%, 70% of the time they'll move up a fourth.

06:29.520 --> 06:35.000
In other words, c likes to move to f, f likes to move to b-flat, b-flat likes to move to

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
e-flat, and so on, okay?

06:37.000 --> 06:42.280
So they, particularly if you have a seventh, if you put a seventh on c, that chord, c-seventh

06:42.280 --> 06:44.400
will almost always move to f.

06:44.400 --> 06:49.340
If you have an a-seventh, it will almost always move to d.

06:49.340 --> 06:54.220
If you have a d-seventh, it'll most always move to g, and so on, okay?

06:54.220 --> 06:56.740
So chords like to move up a fourth.

06:56.740 --> 07:00.940
They don't always, you got to remember the primary chords, but chords like to move up

07:00.940 --> 07:01.940
a fourth.

07:01.940 --> 07:06.540
And so you can learn just the very basic of chord progressions from that.

07:06.540 --> 07:10.540
And again, there's way more that we can say about that, but I won't say any more right

07:10.540 --> 07:11.540
now.

07:11.540 --> 07:17.860
And then thirdly, or seventh, the seventh thing you can learn from the major circle of keys,

07:18.220 --> 07:20.220
chord substitutions.

07:20.220 --> 07:26.900
In other words, if I'm, if I have the c chord, and I want to make a chord substitution for

07:26.900 --> 07:34.020
it, and I have to ask myself, into what other chord will this melody no fits?

07:34.020 --> 07:38.060
Let's say I'm playing the c chord, but the melody note is g.

07:38.060 --> 07:43.580
So I have to ask myself, what other chord is g in, okay?

07:43.820 --> 07:48.380
And I know from experience, and you could learn this from experience too, that g is

07:48.380 --> 07:55.020
in the e-flat chord, and so I can try the e-flat chord as a substitute for c.

07:55.020 --> 07:57.940
What other chord is g in?

07:57.940 --> 08:03.140
Well, it's in, it could be the third of something, it could be the fifth of something, it could

08:03.140 --> 08:08.500
be the seventh of something, but you ask yourself, into what other chord will this note fit?

08:08.500 --> 08:09.500
Okay?

08:09.500 --> 08:12.940
Well, I'm out of time, so thanks for being with me, and I hope you've learned something

08:12.940 --> 08:14.700
from this amazing circle of fests.

08:14.700 --> 08:18.740
We'll do this again, and I'll take it in more depth next time around.

08:18.740 --> 08:22.100
So thanks for being with me, and bye-bye for now.
