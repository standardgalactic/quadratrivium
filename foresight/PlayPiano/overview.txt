Checking PlayPiano/The Amazing ＂Circle of Fifths＂： 7 Things You Can Learn From It!.txt
1. **Primary Chords**: These are the foundational chords of a key and include the tonic (I), the dominant (V), and the subdominant (IV). In the key of D major, these would be D, A, and F#. They are the most commonly used chords within that key.

2. **Secondary Chords**: These chords are found one step to the left or right of the primary chords on the circle of fifths. In the key of C major, the secondary chords in order would be D (ii), G (iii), E (VI).

3. **Chord Progressions**: Chords often move up a fourth. For example, from C to F, from F to Bb, and so on. This is a common movement pattern within chord progressions.

4. **Chromatic Mediants**: When the melody fits over a chord that isn't the key's primary or secondary chord, you can use a chord substitution. For instance, if the melody note G fits over a C chord but sounds better over an Eb chord, you can substitute the Eb chord for C in that context.

5. **Circle of Fifths**: This concept is not just about finding the key signature of relative and parallel keys but also about understanding how chords relate to each other and how they can be substituted or progressed from one to another within a piece of music.

The circle of fifths is a powerful tool for musicians to understand harmony, voice leading, and progression structures, which are fundamental aspects of Western music theory. It's a foundational concept that can help musicians create more interesting and harmonic compositions and improvisations.
