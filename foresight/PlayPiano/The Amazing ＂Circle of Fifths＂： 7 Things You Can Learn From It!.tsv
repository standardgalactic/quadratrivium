0	7520	Hi, this is Dwayne, and today I'd like to talk about the amazing circle of keys.
7520	12560	The circle of keys is also known sometimes as the circle of fifths or the circle of
12560	13560	fourths.
13560	17200	But when people talk about those, they're talking about the very same thing.
17200	21800	The circle of keys is the same thing as the circle of fifths or the circle of fourths.
21800	24960	And there's all kinds of exciting things you can learn from that, and I'd like to talk
24960	28680	about seven of them today.
28680	32560	The first thing I'd like to talk about is the order of the sharps.
32560	37920	You can learn the order of the sharps as they occur in music.
37920	43520	In other words, if there's a key signature and you see one sharp, that sharp is always
43520	45120	right there, f, okay?
45120	46440	You can count on that.
46440	50800	If there's two sharps, the key signature is always f and c sharp, okay?
50800	52680	Two sharps, f and c sharp.
52680	56400	Three are f, c, and g.
56400	60320	If you have four sharps, I bet you know what the fourth one will be, right?
60320	63480	You'd have f, c, g, d.
63480	67360	If you have five sharps, of course, it's f, c, g, d, and a.
67360	71480	And notice these relationships.
71480	73000	There are fifths apart.
73000	75020	C is five notes higher than f.
75020	77160	If you look at the keyboard, you'll see that.
77160	79960	G is five notes higher than c.
79960	82200	D is five notes higher than g.
82200	84920	A is five notes higher than d.
84920	87880	And the next sharp, therefore, would be e.
87880	90420	And the next sharp would be b.
90420	92560	And the next sharp would be f sharp.
92560	102000	So if you had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven sharps, you would have, oh, I'm
102000	104200	sorry, I already named f sharp, didn't I?
104200	105200	Okay.
105200	110120	If you had seven sharps, you'd have f, c, g, d, a, e, b.
110120	115360	If you have seven flats, the order of the seven flats is just opposite from the order
115360	116360	of the sharps.
116360	120480	In other words, if you have one flat, it's always b-flat.
120480	123280	If you have two flats, it's b-flat and e-flat.
123280	126120	Three flats, b-flat, e-flat, a-flat.
126120	130240	Four flats spell the word b, b-e-a-d, okay?
130240	133360	Five flats would be g-flat.
133360	135400	Six flats would be c-flat.
135400	141280	It looks like b is printed there, but inharmonically, it would be c-flat.
141280	147080	And seven flats would be f-flat, inharmonic with e, but don't call it e, call it f-flat,
147080	148080	okay?
148080	152240	So, that's the first thing you can learn is the order of the sharps.
152240	153840	Second thing is the order of the flats.
153840	159520	That third thing you can learn from this circle is the relationship of keys, the related keys.
159520	164600	If you're on the key of c, it's most likely, I mean, it's most closely related to the key
164600	167320	of f because there's only one difference.
167320	171360	The key of c has no sharps or flats, and the key of f has one flat.
171360	176680	So, the only difference between the key of c and the key of f is that one flat.
176680	181080	And we already learned that one flat is always b-flat, okay?
181080	183720	C is also closely related to the key of g.
183720	184720	Why?
184720	188360	Because there's only one difference, the sharp and the key of g, which is f-sharp, which
188360	190760	we already learned, okay?
190760	195840	There's two differences between the key of c and the key of d, and you know by now those
195840	198360	are the two sharps.
198360	203800	There's two differences between the key of c and the key of b-flat, the two flats in
203800	206240	the key of b-flat, all right?
206240	207240	And so on.
207240	209520	Three differences between the key of c and the key of b-flat.
209520	215440	So, the most closely related keys to one another are the ones that are closest on this circle.
215440	219960	In other words, if you're in the key of e, what are the most closely related keys to
219960	220960	you?
220960	224880	Right, the key of a, the key of b.
224880	231040	The next most likely would be the key of d or the key of f-sharp, okay?
231040	237640	So, either move left or right on the circle, and those are the most closely related keys.
237640	241480	I'm kind of going fast here because I want to cover all seven here at a limited time,
241480	247800	so let's move on to the next thing that the circle of keys relate, and that's the primary
247800	248960	chords.
248960	254040	If you're in the key of c, the primary chords or the most used chords in the key of c are
254040	261680	c, g, and f, in other words, the key itself, the key note itself plus the ones on the right
261680	264160	and on the left, okay?
264160	265160	Those are the most used chords.
265160	269280	So, if you're in the key of b-flat, what are the most used chords?
269280	275000	The most used chords in the key of b-flat are f and e-flat, to the left or right, okay?
275000	277840	If you're in the key of a-flat, what are the most used chords?
277840	280760	Right, a-flat, e-flat, and d-flat.
280760	284320	If you're in the key of d, what do you think the most used chords are?
284320	290280	Right, the key a-chord and the g-chord, the most used chords, okay?
290280	291840	They don't have to happen, but they do.
291840	295040	If you dumped all the songs that have ever been written in a computer, those would come
295040	296280	out.
296280	297280	Those three would come out.
297280	298600	They're called the primary chords.
298600	302000	They're primary because they're indigenous to that key.
302000	306080	And I won't get into explaining why, but they are, okay?
306080	311120	The next thing you can learn from the circle of keys are secondary chords.
311120	314160	We learned about primary chords right there, okay?
314160	318000	That the primary chords are to the left and right.
318000	326080	Well, the secondary chords after the primary chords are the next three, basically three
326080	329600	could be four, to the left of whatever key you're in.
329600	333460	In other words, the primary chords in the key of c are c, f, and g, but the secondary
333460	336480	chords are d, a, and e.
336480	340800	And that's the most likely the order in which they'll happen, too.
340800	344640	In other words, if you're in the key of c, after the g-chord and the f-chord, the next
344640	347160	most likely chord is the d-chord.
347160	350440	The next most likely chord after that in the key of c is a-chord.
350440	352600	The next most likely chord after that is the e-chord.
352600	354800	The next most likely chord is the b-chord.
354800	359440	And the least likely chord is f-chord, or chief left, of course, okay?
359440	366240	So you can always move to the left to find out the secondary chords.
366240	372640	The sixth thing you can learn from the circle of keys are chord progressions, the way chords
372640	373960	want to move.
373960	377920	And chords generally want to move up a fourth.
377920	382880	Quite often they don't always, of course, but you can count most of the time that they'll
382880	384080	move up a fourth.
384080	389520	Quite often, probably, you know, 60%, 70% of the time they'll move up a fourth.
389520	395000	In other words, c likes to move to f, f likes to move to b-flat, b-flat likes to move to
395000	397000	e-flat, and so on, okay?
397000	402280	So they, particularly if you have a seventh, if you put a seventh on c, that chord, c-seventh
402280	404400	will almost always move to f.
404400	409340	If you have an a-seventh, it will almost always move to d.
409340	414220	If you have a d-seventh, it'll most always move to g, and so on, okay?
414220	416740	So chords like to move up a fourth.
416740	420940	They don't always, you got to remember the primary chords, but chords like to move up
420940	421940	a fourth.
421940	426540	And so you can learn just the very basic of chord progressions from that.
426540	430540	And again, there's way more that we can say about that, but I won't say any more right
430540	431540	now.
431540	437860	And then thirdly, or seventh, the seventh thing you can learn from the major circle of keys,
438220	440220	chord substitutions.
440220	446900	In other words, if I'm, if I have the c chord, and I want to make a chord substitution for
446900	454020	it, and I have to ask myself, into what other chord will this melody no fits?
454020	458060	Let's say I'm playing the c chord, but the melody note is g.
458060	463580	So I have to ask myself, what other chord is g in, okay?
463820	468380	And I know from experience, and you could learn this from experience too, that g is
468380	475020	in the e-flat chord, and so I can try the e-flat chord as a substitute for c.
475020	477940	What other chord is g in?
477940	483140	Well, it's in, it could be the third of something, it could be the fifth of something, it could
483140	488500	be the seventh of something, but you ask yourself, into what other chord will this note fit?
488500	489500	Okay?
489500	492940	Well, I'm out of time, so thanks for being with me, and I hope you've learned something
492940	494700	from this amazing circle of fests.
494700	498740	We'll do this again, and I'll take it in more depth next time around.
498740	502100	So thanks for being with me, and bye-bye for now.
