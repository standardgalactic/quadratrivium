00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
Hi, this is Dwayne, and today I'd like to talk about the amazing circle of keys.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,560
The circle of keys is also known sometimes as the circle of fifths or the circle of

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,560
fourths.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,200
But when people talk about those, they're talking about the very same thing.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,800
The circle of keys is the same thing as the circle of fifths or the circle of fourths.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,960
And there's all kinds of exciting things you can learn from that, and I'd like to talk

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,680
about seven of them today.

8
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,560
The first thing I'd like to talk about is the order of the sharps.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,920
You can learn the order of the sharps as they occur in music.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,520
In other words, if there's a key signature and you see one sharp, that sharp is always

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,120
right there, f, okay?

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,440
You can count on that.

13
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,800
If there's two sharps, the key signature is always f and c sharp, okay?

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,680
Two sharps, f and c sharp.

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,400
Three are f, c, and g.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,320
If you have four sharps, I bet you know what the fourth one will be, right?

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,480
You'd have f, c, g, d.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,360
If you have five sharps, of course, it's f, c, g, d, and a.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,480
And notice these relationships.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,000
There are fifths apart.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,020
C is five notes higher than f.

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,160
If you look at the keyboard, you'll see that.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,960
G is five notes higher than c.

24
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,200
D is five notes higher than g.

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,920
A is five notes higher than d.

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,880
And the next sharp, therefore, would be e.

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,420
And the next sharp would be b.

28
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,560
And the next sharp would be f sharp.

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:42,000
So if you had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven sharps, you would have, oh, I'm

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,200
sorry, I already named f sharp, didn't I?

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Okay.

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,120
If you had seven sharps, you'd have f, c, g, d, a, e, b.

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,360
If you have seven flats, the order of the seven flats is just opposite from the order

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
of the sharps.

35
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,480
In other words, if you have one flat, it's always b-flat.

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,280
If you have two flats, it's b-flat and e-flat.

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,120
Three flats, b-flat, e-flat, a-flat.

38
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,240
Four flats spell the word b, b-e-a-d, okay?

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,360
Five flats would be g-flat.

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,400
Six flats would be c-flat.

41
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,280
It looks like b is printed there, but inharmonically, it would be c-flat.

42
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,080
And seven flats would be f-flat, inharmonic with e, but don't call it e, call it f-flat,

43
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
okay?

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,240
So, that's the first thing you can learn is the order of the sharps.

45
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,840
Second thing is the order of the flats.

46
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,520
That third thing you can learn from this circle is the relationship of keys, the related keys.

47
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,600
If you're on the key of c, it's most likely, I mean, it's most closely related to the key

48
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,320
of f because there's only one difference.

49
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,360
The key of c has no sharps or flats, and the key of f has one flat.

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,680
So, the only difference between the key of c and the key of f is that one flat.

51
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,080
And we already learned that one flat is always b-flat, okay?

52
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,720
C is also closely related to the key of g.

53
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,720
Why?

54
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,360
Because there's only one difference, the sharp and the key of g, which is f-sharp, which

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,760
we already learned, okay?

56
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,840
There's two differences between the key of c and the key of d, and you know by now those

57
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,360
are the two sharps.

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,800
There's two differences between the key of c and the key of b-flat, the two flats in

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,240
the key of b-flat, all right?

60
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
And so on.

61
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,520
Three differences between the key of c and the key of b-flat.

62
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,440
So, the most closely related keys to one another are the ones that are closest on this circle.

63
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,960
In other words, if you're in the key of e, what are the most closely related keys to

64
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
you?

65
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,880
Right, the key of a, the key of b.

66
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:51,040
The next most likely would be the key of d or the key of f-sharp, okay?

67
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,640
So, either move left or right on the circle, and those are the most closely related keys.

68
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,480
I'm kind of going fast here because I want to cover all seven here at a limited time,

69
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,800
so let's move on to the next thing that the circle of keys relate, and that's the primary

70
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,960
chords.

71
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,040
If you're in the key of c, the primary chords or the most used chords in the key of c are

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:21,680
c, g, and f, in other words, the key itself, the key note itself plus the ones on the right

73
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,160
and on the left, okay?

74
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Those are the most used chords.

75
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,280
So, if you're in the key of b-flat, what are the most used chords?

76
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,000
The most used chords in the key of b-flat are f and e-flat, to the left or right, okay?

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,840
If you're in the key of a-flat, what are the most used chords?

78
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,760
Right, a-flat, e-flat, and d-flat.

79
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,320
If you're in the key of d, what do you think the most used chords are?

80
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,280
Right, the key a-chord and the g-chord, the most used chords, okay?

81
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,840
They don't have to happen, but they do.

82
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,040
If you dumped all the songs that have ever been written in a computer, those would come

83
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,280
out.

84
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,280
Those three would come out.

85
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,600
They're called the primary chords.

86
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,000
They're primary because they're indigenous to that key.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,080
And I won't get into explaining why, but they are, okay?

88
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,120
The next thing you can learn from the circle of keys are secondary chords.

89
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,160
We learned about primary chords right there, okay?

90
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,000
That the primary chords are to the left and right.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,080
Well, the secondary chords after the primary chords are the next three, basically three

92
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,600
could be four, to the left of whatever key you're in.

93
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,460
In other words, the primary chords in the key of c are c, f, and g, but the secondary

94
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,480
chords are d, a, and e.

95
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,800
And that's the most likely the order in which they'll happen, too.

96
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,640
In other words, if you're in the key of c, after the g-chord and the f-chord, the next

97
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,160
most likely chord is the d-chord.

98
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,440
The next most likely chord after that in the key of c is a-chord.

99
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,600
The next most likely chord after that is the e-chord.

100
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,800
The next most likely chord is the b-chord.

101
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,440
And the least likely chord is f-chord, or chief left, of course, okay?

102
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:06,240
So you can always move to the left to find out the secondary chords.

103
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,640
The sixth thing you can learn from the circle of keys are chord progressions, the way chords

104
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,960
want to move.

105
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,920
And chords generally want to move up a fourth.

106
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,880
Quite often they don't always, of course, but you can count most of the time that they'll

107
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,080
move up a fourth.

108
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,520
Quite often, probably, you know, 60%, 70% of the time they'll move up a fourth.

109
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,000
In other words, c likes to move to f, f likes to move to b-flat, b-flat likes to move to

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
e-flat, and so on, okay?

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,280
So they, particularly if you have a seventh, if you put a seventh on c, that chord, c-seventh

112
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,400
will almost always move to f.

113
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,340
If you have an a-seventh, it will almost always move to d.

114
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,220
If you have a d-seventh, it'll most always move to g, and so on, okay?

115
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,740
So chords like to move up a fourth.

116
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,940
They don't always, you got to remember the primary chords, but chords like to move up

117
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:01,940
a fourth.

118
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,540
And so you can learn just the very basic of chord progressions from that.

119
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,540
And again, there's way more that we can say about that, but I won't say any more right

120
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,540
now.

121
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:17,860
And then thirdly, or seventh, the seventh thing you can learn from the major circle of keys,

122
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,220
chord substitutions.

123
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:26,900
In other words, if I'm, if I have the c chord, and I want to make a chord substitution for

124
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:34,020
it, and I have to ask myself, into what other chord will this melody no fits?

125
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,060
Let's say I'm playing the c chord, but the melody note is g.

126
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:43,580
So I have to ask myself, what other chord is g in, okay?

127
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,380
And I know from experience, and you could learn this from experience too, that g is

128
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:55,020
in the e-flat chord, and so I can try the e-flat chord as a substitute for c.

129
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,940
What other chord is g in?

130
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:03,140
Well, it's in, it could be the third of something, it could be the fifth of something, it could

131
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:08,500
be the seventh of something, but you ask yourself, into what other chord will this note fit?

132
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Okay?

133
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,940
Well, I'm out of time, so thanks for being with me, and I hope you've learned something

134
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,700
from this amazing circle of fests.

135
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,740
We'll do this again, and I'll take it in more depth next time around.

136
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,100
So thanks for being with me, and bye-bye for now.
