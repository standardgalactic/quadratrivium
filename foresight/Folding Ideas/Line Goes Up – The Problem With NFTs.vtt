00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
For online content creators, the unavoidable subject of 2021 has been NFTs, from incredibly

00:05.680 --> 00:10.800
cringe-worthy ape profile pics to incomprehensibly tasteless tributes to deceased celebrities

00:10.800 --> 00:15.960
to six-figure sales of the original copy of a meme, it is the thing that is currently

00:15.960 --> 00:21.000
dominating the collective brain space of digital artists and sucking up all the oxygen in the room.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.360
And I do want to talk about that.

00:22.360 --> 00:27.600
I want to talk about my opinions on NFTs and digital ownership and scarcity and all the

00:27.600 --> 00:32.480
myriad dimensions of the issue, but I don't just want to talk about NFTs.

00:32.480 --> 00:39.520
I can't just talk about NFTs because ultimately they are just a symbol of so much more and

00:39.520 --> 00:43.000
it is that more that is ultimately important.

00:43.000 --> 01:12.320
So let me tell you a story.

01:12.320 --> 01:15.160
In 2008 the economy functionally collapsed.

01:15.160 --> 01:17.920
The basic chain reaction was this.

01:17.920 --> 01:21.880
Banks came up with a thing called a mortgage-backed security, a financial instrument that could

01:21.880 --> 01:27.240
be traded or collected that was based on a bundle of thousands of individual mortgages.

01:27.240 --> 01:31.680
Based on the general reluctance of banks to issue mortgages, the risk aversion in lending

01:31.680 --> 01:36.480
someone hundreds of thousands of dollars that they'll pay off over the course of potentially

01:36.480 --> 01:40.200
decades, these bonds were seen as especially stable.

01:40.200 --> 01:45.800
However, they were also immensely profitable for the banks who both issue the mortgages

01:45.800 --> 01:47.840
and the bonds.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.920
Because of that perceived stability, a lot of other financial organizations like pension

01:51.920 --> 01:56.500
funds and hedge funds use them as the backbone of their investment portfolio.

01:56.500 --> 02:01.080
In this arrangement, a mortgage becomes more profitable to the bank issuing the mortgage

02:01.080 --> 02:05.480
as a component of a bond than it is as a mortgage.

02:05.480 --> 02:09.600
Proportionally the returns per mortgage from the bond are just that much better than the

02:09.600 --> 02:11.880
returns from the isolated mortgage.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.040
There are some problems though.

02:14.040 --> 02:17.920
Problem one is that the biggest returns on a bond come from when it first hits the market.

02:17.920 --> 02:23.360
A new bond that creates new security sales is worth more than an old bond that is slowly

02:23.360 --> 02:26.680
appreciating but not seeing much trade.

02:26.680 --> 02:31.160
Problem two is that there are a finite number of people and houses in America.

02:31.160 --> 02:36.320
The market has to level out at a natural ceiling as eventually all or nearly all mortgages

02:36.320 --> 02:41.160
are packaged into bonds, thus very few new bonds can be generated and sold.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.200
So here's the incentives that are created.

02:43.200 --> 02:48.040
One, it's good for banks if there are more houses that they can issue mortgages for.

02:48.040 --> 02:53.960
Two, the more mortgages issued the better because a bad mortgage is worth more as a component

02:53.960 --> 02:58.200
of a bond than a good mortgage that's not part of a bond.

02:58.200 --> 03:02.880
So real estate developers find that they have a really easy time getting funding from banks

03:02.880 --> 03:07.200
for creating vast new suburbs full of houses that can be sold to generate mortgages, but

03:07.200 --> 03:12.040
rather than building the kind of housing that most people actually need and want, they focus

03:12.040 --> 03:16.840
specifically on the kinds of upper middle class houses that fit into the sweet spot

03:16.840 --> 03:19.800
from the perspective of the banks packaging the bonds.

03:19.800 --> 03:24.720
Buyers in turn find that they have a suspiciously easy time getting a mortgage, despite the

03:24.720 --> 03:29.080
fact that for most people the economy wasn't doing so great.

03:29.160 --> 03:33.960
Wages were stagnant and yet even though developers were going absolutely haywire building new

03:33.960 --> 03:38.280
housing, the houses being built were all out of their price range to begin with and counter

03:38.280 --> 03:44.960
intuitively this massive increase in supply wasn't driving down the price.

03:44.960 --> 03:49.320
This is because the houses were being bought just mostly not by people intending to live

03:49.320 --> 03:54.080
in them, they were being bought by speculators who would then maybe rent them out or often

03:54.080 --> 03:58.360
just leave them vacant with the intent to sell a couple years later.

03:58.360 --> 04:02.240
Because speculators were buying up the supply, it created synthetic demand.

04:02.240 --> 04:07.080
The price keeps going up because speculators keep buying which creates the illusion that

04:07.080 --> 04:12.320
the value is going up which attracts more speculators who buy up more supply and further

04:12.320 --> 04:13.860
inflate the price.

04:13.860 --> 04:18.320
These speculators are enabled by a system that is prioritizing generating new mortgages

04:18.320 --> 04:22.440
purely for the sake of having more mortgages to package into bonds.

04:22.440 --> 04:26.840
The down payments are low and the mortgages all have a really attractive teaser rate meaning

04:26.840 --> 04:31.840
that for the first 3-7 years of the mortgage the monthly payments are rock bottom, as low

04:31.840 --> 04:36.840
as a few hundred dollars per month against a mortgage that would normally charge thousands.

04:36.840 --> 04:41.400
Caught up in all this are legitimate buyers who have been lured into signing for a mortgage

04:41.400 --> 04:46.280
that they can't afford by aggressive sales people who have an incentive to generate mortgages

04:46.280 --> 04:50.280
that they can then sell to a bank who can put it into a bond to sell to pension funds

04:50.280 --> 04:53.800
to make a line go up because it's good when the line goes up.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.120
It's a bubble.

04:55.120 --> 04:58.840
The bubble burst as the teaser rates on the mortgages started to expire.

04:58.840 --> 05:03.960
The monthly cost jumped up and since the demand was synthetic there were no actual buyers

05:03.960 --> 05:06.440
for the speculators to sell the houses to.

05:06.440 --> 05:11.120
So the speculators start dumping stock which finally drives prices down, but because the

05:11.120 --> 05:17.600
original price was so inflated the new price is still out of reach of most actual buyers.

05:17.600 --> 05:21.400
Legitimate buyers caught in the middle find their rates jumping too, but because the price

05:21.400 --> 05:25.600
of the house is going down as speculators try and dump their stock the price of the

05:25.600 --> 05:31.360
house goes down relative to the mortgage issued and thus they can't refinance and are locked

05:31.360 --> 05:33.640
into paying the original terms.

05:33.640 --> 05:37.720
Unable to sell the house and unable to afford the monthly payments the owners, legitimate

05:37.720 --> 05:40.600
and speculators default on their mortgages.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.960
They stop paying.

05:41.960 --> 05:46.800
Eventually the default rate reaches criticality and the bonds fail.

05:46.800 --> 05:52.640
As the bonds fail this impacts all the first order buyers of the bonds, hedge funds, pension

05:52.640 --> 05:55.020
funds, retirement savings funds and the like.

05:55.020 --> 06:00.880
It also cascades through all derivatives which are financial products that take their value

06:00.880 --> 06:03.440
directly from the value of the bond.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.600
This creates a knock on effect.

06:05.600 --> 06:11.280
Huge segments of the economy turn out to be dead trees rotten to the core, but as a rotten

06:11.280 --> 06:16.600
tree falls it still shreds its neighbors and crushes anything below it.

06:16.600 --> 06:21.360
It was a failure precipitated by a combination of greed, active fraud and willful blindness

06:21.360 --> 06:23.040
at all levels of power.

06:23.040 --> 06:27.200
The banks issuing the bad mortgages were the same banks selling the bonds and providing

06:27.200 --> 06:30.200
the capital to build the houses to generate the mortgages.

06:30.200 --> 06:34.720
The ratings agencies checking the bonds were themselves publicly traded and dependent on

06:34.720 --> 06:39.520
being in good relations with the banks incentivized to rubber stamp whatever rating would make

06:39.520 --> 06:41.020
their client happy.

06:41.020 --> 06:45.720
The regulatory agencies that should have seen the problem coming were gutted by budget cuts

06:45.720 --> 06:50.080
admired in conflicts of interest as employees use their positions in regulation to secure

06:50.080 --> 06:52.040
higher paying jobs in industry.

06:52.040 --> 06:56.880
And, the cherry on top, the people largely responsible for it all knew that because they

06:56.880 --> 07:01.600
and their toxic products were so interwoven into the foundations of the economy they could

07:01.600 --> 07:06.960
count on a bailout from the government because no matter how rotten they were, they were

07:06.960 --> 07:08.960
very large trees.

07:15.720 --> 07:24.520
This naked display of greed and fraud created what would be fertile soil for both anti-capitalist

07:24.520 --> 07:29.160
movements and hyper-capitalist movements, both groups of people who saw themselves as being

07:29.160 --> 07:34.960
screwed over by the system, with one group diagnosing the problem as the systems inherently

07:34.960 --> 07:40.200
corrupt and corrupting incentives, and the other seeing the crisis as a consequence of

07:40.200 --> 07:43.720
too much regulation, too much exclusion.

07:43.720 --> 07:48.640
The hyper-capitalist or anarcho-capitalist argument is that in a less constrained market

07:48.640 --> 07:54.040
there would be more incentive to call foul, that regulation had only succeeded in creating

07:54.040 --> 07:58.560
an in-group that was effectively able to conspire without competition.

07:58.560 --> 08:02.160
Of course this argument fails to consider that a substantial number of people within

08:02.160 --> 08:07.240
the system did in fact get fabulously wealthy specifically by betting against the synthetic

08:07.240 --> 08:10.160
excess of the market, but regardless.

08:10.160 --> 08:16.800
Into this environment in 2009 arrived Bitcoin, an all-electronic peer-to-peer currency.

08:16.800 --> 08:21.680
Philosophically Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general was paraded as an end to banks

08:21.680 --> 08:23.840
and centralized currency.

08:23.840 --> 08:28.000
This is what will form the bedrock, both philosophical and technological, that NFTs

08:28.000 --> 08:29.800
will be built on top of.

08:29.800 --> 08:35.400
It's a bit of a hike from here to the board APIOT club, so I guess get ready for that.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.400
Strap in.

08:36.400 --> 08:39.400
As we get into this we're going to have to deal with a lot of vocabulary.

08:39.640 --> 08:45.360
Some of this is the result of systems that are very technically intricate, and some of

08:45.360 --> 08:49.840
this is from systems that are poorly designed, or deliberately obtuse in order to make them

08:49.840 --> 08:53.280
difficult to understand, and thus appear more legitimate.

08:53.280 --> 08:57.320
The entire subject sits at the intersection of two fields that are notoriously prone to

08:57.320 --> 09:02.900
hyped based obfuscation, computer tech and finance, and inheritance a lot of bad habits

09:02.900 --> 09:07.680
from both, with a reputation for making things deliberately more difficult to understand,

09:07.680 --> 09:13.160
specifically to create the illusion that only they are smart enough to understand it.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.880
Mining and minting are both methods of making tokens, which are the base thing that blockchains

09:17.880 --> 09:23.200
deal with, but the two are colloquially different processes, where mining is a coin token created

09:23.200 --> 09:28.000
as a result of the consensus protocol, and minting is user-initiated, addition of a token

09:28.000 --> 09:29.360
to a blockchain.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.960
All blockchains are made of nodes, and these nodes can be watcher nodes, miner nodes or

09:32.960 --> 09:37.680
validator nodes, though most miner nodes are also validator nodes.

09:37.680 --> 09:41.360
Fractionalization is the process of taking one asset and creating a new asset that represents

09:41.360 --> 09:43.200
portions of the original.

09:43.200 --> 09:49.040
So you get DOG, a meme coin crypto D5 venture capital fund backed by the fractionalization

09:49.040 --> 09:53.840
of the original Doge meme sold as an NFT to PleaserDAO on the Ethereum network.

09:53.840 --> 09:58.200
I'm sorry, some of this is just gonna be like that.

09:58.200 --> 10:02.800
The idea behind cryptocurrency is that your digital wallet functions the same as a bank

10:02.800 --> 10:03.640
account.

10:03.640 --> 10:07.640
There's no need for a bank to hold and process your transactions, because rather than holding

10:07.640 --> 10:12.320
a sum that conceptually represents physical currency, the crypto coins in your crypto

10:12.320 --> 10:15.080
wallet are the actual money.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.760
And because this money isn't issued by a government, it is resistant to historical

10:18.760 --> 10:23.920
cash crises like hyperinflation caused by governments devaluing their currency on purpose

10:23.920 --> 10:25.240
or by accident.

10:25.240 --> 10:29.840
It brings the flexibility and anonymity of cash and barter to the digital realm, allowing

10:29.840 --> 10:33.920
individuals to transact without oversight or intermediaries.

10:33.920 --> 10:39.800
And in a one paragraph pitch you can see the appeal, there's a compelling narrative there.

10:39.800 --> 10:44.400
But of course in the 12 years since then, none of that played out as designed.

10:44.400 --> 10:49.160
Bitcoin was structurally too slow and expensive to handle regular commerce, the whole thing

10:49.160 --> 10:54.040
basically came out the gate as a speculative financial vehicle, and so the only consumer

10:54.040 --> 10:59.080
market that proved to be a viable use was buying and selling prohibited drugs where

10:59.120 --> 11:04.760
the high fees, rapid price fluctuations, and multi-hour transaction times were mitigated

11:04.760 --> 11:08.640
by receiving LSD in the mail a week later.

11:08.640 --> 11:12.920
And as far as banking is concerned, Bitcoin was never designed to solve the actual problems

11:12.920 --> 11:18.000
created by the banking industry, only to be the new medium by which they operated.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
The principal offering wasn't revolution, but at best a changing of the guard.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.240
The gripe is not with the outcomes of 2008, but the fact that you had to be well connected

11:26.360 --> 11:29.960
in order to get in on the grift in 2006.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.560
And even the change of the guard is an illusion.

11:32.560 --> 11:36.400
Old money finance assholes like the Winklevoss twins were some of the first big names to

11:36.400 --> 11:40.000
jump onto crypto where they remain to this day.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.720
Financial criminal Jordan Belfort, convicted of fraud for running pump and dump schemes

11:43.720 --> 11:48.960
and barred for life from trading regulated securities or acting as a broker, loves crypto.

11:48.960 --> 11:53.120
Venture capitalist Chris Dixon, who has made huge bank off the old web in his role as a

11:53.120 --> 11:58.560
general partner at VC firm Anderson Horowitz, is super popular in the NFT space.

11:58.560 --> 12:04.000
He likes to paint himself as an outsider underdog, fighting the gatekeepers, but he also sits

12:04.000 --> 12:08.800
on the boards of Coinbase, a large cryptocurrency exchange that makes money by being the gatekeeper

12:08.800 --> 12:13.760
collecting a fee on all entries and exits to the crypto economy, and Oculus VR, which

12:13.760 --> 12:15.960
is owned by Meta and a Facebook.

12:15.960 --> 12:21.000
Peter Thiel, who also went from wealthy to ultra-wealthy off the web to boom via PayPal,

12:21.000 --> 12:25.360
loves crypto, and his friends with a bunch of eugenics advocates who promote cryptocurrency

12:25.360 --> 12:27.960
as a return to sound money.

12:27.960 --> 12:32.560
For a whole bunch of extremely racist reasons, because when they start talking about banks

12:32.560 --> 12:35.280
and bankers, they mean Jews.

12:35.280 --> 12:39.880
Some of the largest institutional holders of cryptocurrency are the exact same investment

12:39.880 --> 12:43.400
banks that created the subprime loan crash.

12:43.400 --> 12:47.520
Rather than being a reprieve to the people harmed by the housing bubble, the people whose

12:47.560 --> 12:54.040
savings and retirements were unknown to them being gambled on smoke, cryptocurrency instantly

12:54.040 --> 12:57.200
became the new playground for smoke vendors.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.400
This is a really important point to stress.

13:00.400 --> 13:05.760
Cryptocurrency does nothing to address 99% of the problems with the banking industry,

13:05.760 --> 13:11.360
because those problems are patterns of human behavior, their incentives, their social structures,

13:11.360 --> 13:12.360
their modalities.

13:12.360 --> 13:17.480
The problem is what people are doing to others, not that the building they're doing it in

13:17.480 --> 13:20.560
has the word bank on the outside.

13:20.560 --> 13:26.040
In addition to not fixing problems, bitcoin also came with a pretty substantial drawback.

13:26.040 --> 13:30.380
The innovation of bitcoin over previous attempts at digital currency was to employ a distributed

13:30.380 --> 13:35.440
append-only ledger, a kind of database where new entries can only be added to the end,

13:35.440 --> 13:40.200
and then to have several different nodes called validators compete over who gets to validate

13:40.200 --> 13:41.680
the next update.

13:41.680 --> 13:46.680
These are, respectively, the blockchain and proof-of-work verification.

13:46.760 --> 13:51.080
Now, proof-of-work has an interesting history as a technology, typically being deployed

13:51.080 --> 13:53.440
as a deterrent to misbehavior.

13:53.440 --> 13:58.280
For example, if you require that every email sent, the user's computer has to compute

13:58.280 --> 14:00.040
a small math program.

14:00.040 --> 14:05.200
It places a trivial load onto normal users sending a few dozen, or even a couple hundred

14:05.200 --> 14:09.880
emails a day, but places a massive load on the infrastructure of anyone attempting to

14:09.880 --> 14:12.400
spam millions of emails.

14:12.400 --> 14:16.640
How it works in bitcoin, simply put, is that when a block of transactions are ready to

14:16.640 --> 14:21.240
be recorded to the ledger, all of the mining nodes in the network compete with one another

14:21.240 --> 14:26.680
to solve a cryptographic math problem that's based on the data inside the block.

14:26.680 --> 14:31.840
Effectively, they're competing to figure out the equation that yields a specific result

14:31.840 --> 14:36.520
when the contents of the block are fed into it, with the complexity of the desired result

14:36.520 --> 14:41.120
getting deliberately more difficult based on the total processing power available to

14:41.120 --> 14:42.360
the network.

14:42.360 --> 14:46.120
Once the math problem has been solved, the rest of the validation network can easily

14:46.120 --> 14:50.160
double-check the work, since the contents of the block can be fed into the proposed

14:50.160 --> 14:54.360
solution and it either spits out the valid answer, or fails.

14:54.360 --> 14:58.480
If the equation works and the consensus of validator signs off on it, the block is added

14:58.480 --> 15:02.360
to the bottom of the ledger, and the miner who solved the problem first is rewarded with

15:02.360 --> 15:04.280
newly generated bitcoin.

15:04.280 --> 15:08.640
The complexity of the answer that the computers are trying to solve scales up based on the

15:08.640 --> 15:14.040
network's processing power, specifically to incur heavy diminishing returns as a protection

15:14.040 --> 15:19.920
against an attack on the network where someone just builds a bigger computer and takes over.

15:19.920 --> 15:23.120
Critics pointed out that this created new problems.

15:23.120 --> 15:27.160
Adversarial validation would deliberately incur escalating processing costs, which would

15:27.160 --> 15:31.600
in turn generate perverse structural incentives that would quickly reward capital holders

15:31.600 --> 15:36.120
and lock out any individual that wasn't already obscenely wealthy, because while the escalating

15:36.120 --> 15:41.480
proof of work scheme incurs heavy diminishing returns, diminishing returns are still returns,

15:41.480 --> 15:46.160
so more would always go to those with the resources to build the bigger rig.

15:46.160 --> 15:51.080
No matter what bitcoin future was envisioned, in the here and now, computer hardware can

15:51.080 --> 15:53.040
be bought with dollars.

15:53.040 --> 15:57.880
Rather than dismantling corrupt power structures, this would just become a new tool for existing

15:57.880 --> 15:58.880
wealth.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.200
And that's...exactly what happened.

16:02.200 --> 16:06.920
Just began an arms race for bigger and bigger processing rigs, followed by escalating demands

16:06.920 --> 16:11.800
for the support systems, hardware engineers, HVAC, and operating space needed to put those

16:11.800 --> 16:13.160
rigs in.

16:13.160 --> 16:16.840
And don't worry, we're not forgetting the power requirements.

16:16.840 --> 16:21.360
These rigs draw an industrial amount of power, and because of the winner takes all nature

16:21.360 --> 16:26.600
of the competition, huge amounts of redundant work are being done and discarded.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.120
Estimates for this power consumption are hard to verify.

16:29.120 --> 16:34.040
The data is very complex, spread across hundreds of operators around the globe, who move frequently

16:34.040 --> 16:39.280
in search of cheap electricity, and it's all pretty heavily politicized.

16:39.280 --> 16:43.880
But even conservative estimates from within the crypto mining industry puts the some energy

16:43.880 --> 16:49.120
cost of bitcoin processing on par with the power consumption of a small industrialized

16:49.120 --> 16:50.120
nation.

16:50.120 --> 16:55.080
Now, evangelists will counter that the global banking industry also uses a lot of power,

16:55.080 --> 17:01.200
gesturing at things like idle ATMs humming away all night long, which is, strictly speaking,

17:01.200 --> 17:02.360
not untrue.

17:02.360 --> 17:08.560
On a factual level, the entire global banking industry does, in fact, use a lot of total

17:08.560 --> 17:09.960
electricity.

17:09.960 --> 17:14.480
But for scale, it takes six hours of that sustained power draw for the bitcoin network

17:14.480 --> 17:18.960
to process as many transactions as Visa handles in one minute.

17:18.960 --> 17:25.680
And during that time, Visa is using fractions of a cent of electricity per transaction.

17:25.680 --> 17:29.920
And that's just Visa, that's one major institution.

17:29.920 --> 17:36.840
So yes, globally, the entirety of the banking industry consumes a lot of power, and a non-trivial

17:36.840 --> 17:40.160
portion of that is waste that could be better allocated.

17:40.160 --> 17:45.120
But it's also the global banking industry for 7 billion people, and not the hobby horse

17:45.120 --> 17:47.760
of a few hundred thousand gambling addicts.

17:47.760 --> 17:52.740
So just to head all this off at the pass, bitcoin and proof-of-work cryptocurrency aren't

17:52.740 --> 17:58.260
incentivizing a move to green energy sources like solar and wind, they are offsetting it.

17:58.260 --> 18:03.320
Because electrical consumption, electrical waste, is the value that underpins bitcoin.

18:03.320 --> 18:08.320
Miners spend X dollars in electricity to mine a bitcoin, they expect to be able to sell

18:08.320 --> 18:11.320
that coin for at least X plus profit.

18:11.320 --> 18:15.160
When new power sources come online and the price of electricity goes down, they don't

18:15.160 --> 18:28.080
let X go down, they build a bigger machine.

18:28.080 --> 18:33.120
In 2012, Vitalik Buterin, a crypto enthusiast and butthurt warlock main, set out to fix

18:33.120 --> 18:36.840
what he saw as the failings and inflexibilities of bitcoin.

18:36.840 --> 18:42.040
Rather than becoming the new digital currency, a thing that people actually used to buy stuff,

18:42.040 --> 18:46.760
bitcoin had become an unwieldy speculative financial instrument, too slow and expensive

18:46.760 --> 18:51.000
to use for anything other than stunt purchases of expensive cars.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.360
It was infested with money laundering and mired in bad press.

18:55.360 --> 18:59.840
After the FBI shut down Silk Road, you couldn't even buy drugs with it anymore.

18:59.840 --> 19:04.440
In practice, you couldn't do anything with your bitcoin, but bet on it, lock up money

19:04.440 --> 19:08.840
you already have in the hopes that bitcoin goes up later and pray you don't lose it

19:08.840 --> 19:13.760
all in a scam, lose access to your wallet, or have it all stolen by an exchange.

19:13.760 --> 19:18.720
The result launched in 2014 was Ethereum, a competing cryptocurrency that boasted lower

19:18.720 --> 19:23.600
fees, faster transaction times, a reduced electrical footprint, and most notably, a

19:23.600 --> 19:26.280
sophisticated processing functionality.

19:26.280 --> 19:30.520
While the bitcoin blockchain only tracks the location and movement of bitcoins, Ethereum

19:30.520 --> 19:31.920
would be broader.

19:31.920 --> 19:36.360
In addition to tracking ethercoins, the ledger would also be able to track arbitrary blocks

19:36.360 --> 19:37.360
of data.

19:37.360 --> 19:41.600
As long as they were compatible with the structure of the Ethereum network, these blocks of data

19:41.600 --> 19:46.920
could even be programs that would utilize the validation network as a distributed virtual

19:46.920 --> 19:47.920
machine.

19:47.920 --> 19:52.120
Vitalik envisioned this as a vast infinite machine, duplicated and distributed across

19:52.120 --> 19:57.600
thousands or millions of computers, a system onto which the entire history of a new internet

19:57.600 --> 20:03.400
could be immutably written, immune to censorship and impossible for governments to take down.

20:03.400 --> 20:08.240
He saw it dismantling banks and other intermediary industries, allowing everyone to be their own

20:08.240 --> 20:13.680
bank, to be their own stockbroker, to bypass governments, regulators, and insurance agencies.

20:13.680 --> 20:18.440
His peers envisioned a future where Ethereum became not just a repository of financial

20:18.440 --> 20:20.880
transactions, but of identity.

20:20.880 --> 20:25.000
With these, drivers licenses, professional credentials, medical records, educational

20:25.000 --> 20:29.480
achievements, and employment history turned into tokens and stored immutable and eternal

20:29.480 --> 20:31.200
on the chain.

20:31.200 --> 20:35.080
Through crypto and the Ethereum virtual machine, they could bring all the benefits of Wall

20:35.080 --> 20:39.880
Street investors and Silicon Valley venture capitalists to the poorest people of the world,

20:39.880 --> 20:42.060
the unbanked and forgotten.

20:42.060 --> 20:47.000
This heady, high-minded philosophy is outlined in great detail in the journalistic abortion,

20:47.000 --> 20:51.460
The Infinite Machine, by failed journalist turned crypto shill Camila Rousseau.

20:51.460 --> 20:53.800
The book is actually really interesting.

20:53.800 --> 20:58.120
Not for the merits of the writing, Rousseau fails to interrogate the validity or rationality

20:58.120 --> 21:03.040
of even the simplest claims, and falls just shy of hagiography by occasionally noting

21:03.040 --> 21:07.680
that something was a bit tacky or embarrassing, but only just shy.

21:07.680 --> 21:11.640
She tells florid stories about the impoverished people that Vitalik and Friends claim to

21:11.640 --> 21:16.280
be working to save, but never once considers that the solutions offered might not actually

21:16.280 --> 21:20.360
work, or that the people claiming to want to solve those problems might not even be

21:20.360 --> 21:21.360
working on them.

21:21.360 --> 21:25.760
That's actually a big issue, since the entire crypto space, during the entire time that

21:25.760 --> 21:30.680
Rousseau's book covers, was absolutely awash with astroturfing schemes, where two guys

21:30.680 --> 21:35.000
would go to some small community in Laos or Angola, take a bunch of pictures of people

21:35.000 --> 21:40.160
at a crypto investing seminar, generate some headlines for their coin, or fund, and then

21:40.160 --> 21:41.280
peace out.

21:41.280 --> 21:45.640
For years, dudes were going around asking vendors if they could slap a bitcoin sticker

21:45.640 --> 21:50.520
onto the back of the cash register, because the optics of making it look like a place

21:50.520 --> 21:55.840
takes bitcoin was cheaper and easier than actually using bitcoin as a currency.

21:55.840 --> 22:01.680
We have an entire decade of credulous articles about how Venezuela and Chile are on the verge

22:01.680 --> 22:07.440
of switching entirely to crypto, based entirely on the claim of two trust fund dudes from

22:07.440 --> 22:12.520
San Bernardino, a whole 10 years littered with discarded press releases about Dell and

22:12.520 --> 22:18.680
Microsoft and Square bringing crypto to the consumers before just quietly discontinuing

22:18.680 --> 22:24.240
their services after a year or two when they realize the demand isn't actually there.

22:24.240 --> 22:28.800
The fact the development of Ethereum was extremely dependent on a $100,000 fellowship grant

22:28.800 --> 22:33.480
from Peter Thiel is mentioned, but the ideological implications of that connection are never

22:33.480 --> 22:34.480
explored.

22:34.480 --> 22:40.400
The entire subject occupies a single paragraph sprinkled as flavor into a story about Vitalik

22:40.400 --> 22:44.600
and his co-developers airing their grievances about some petty infighting.

22:44.600 --> 22:49.040
The book is mostly useful for its value as a point of reference against reality.

22:49.040 --> 22:54.360
It's a very thorough if uncritical document of absolutely insane claims.

22:54.360 --> 22:58.600
The idea was that the traits of blockchain technology, such as having no central point

22:58.600 --> 23:03.080
of failure, being uncensorable, cutting out intermediaries and being immutable, could

23:03.080 --> 23:06.560
also benefit other applications besides money.

23:06.560 --> 23:10.480
Financial instruments like stocks and bonds and commodities like gold were the obvious

23:10.880 --> 23:15.000
but people were also talking about putting other representations of value like property

23:15.000 --> 23:18.160
deeds and medical records on the blockchain too.

23:18.160 --> 23:22.640
Those efforts, admirable considering Bitcoin hadn't and still hasn't been adopted widely

23:22.640 --> 23:25.840
as currency, were known as Bitcoin 2.0.

23:25.840 --> 23:29.640
I love this paragraph because it outlines just how disconnected from reality the people

23:29.640 --> 23:32.520
actually building cryptocurrencies really are.

23:32.520 --> 23:36.680
They don't understand anything about the ecosystems they're trying to disrupt.

23:36.680 --> 23:41.040
They only know that these are things that can be conceptualized as valuable and assume

23:41.040 --> 23:46.880
that because they understand one very complicated thing, programming with cryptography, that

23:46.880 --> 23:53.000
all other complicated things must be lesser in complexity and naturally lower in the hierarchy

23:53.000 --> 23:57.880
of reality, nails easily driven by the hammer that they have created.

23:57.880 --> 24:02.920
The idea of putting medical records on a public decentralized trustless blockchain is absolutely

24:02.920 --> 24:06.600
nightmarish and anyone who proposes it should be instantly discredited.

24:06.600 --> 24:11.040
The fact that Rousseau fails to question any of this is journalistic malpractice.

24:11.040 --> 24:14.960
Now in terms of improvements over Bitcoin, Ethereum has many.

24:14.960 --> 24:16.360
It's not hard.

24:16.360 --> 24:17.360
Bitcoin sucks.

24:17.360 --> 24:21.040
In terms of problems with Bitcoin, Ethereum solves none of them and introduces a whole

24:21.040 --> 24:25.960
new suite of problems driven by the technophetistic egotism of assuming that programmers are uniquely

24:25.960 --> 24:28.360
suited to solve society's problems.

24:28.360 --> 24:33.960
Vitalik wants his invention to be an infinite machine, so let's ask what that machine is

24:33.960 --> 24:40.320
built to do.

24:40.320 --> 24:45.000
In order to really understand the full scope of this, we do need to dig a bit more into

24:45.000 --> 24:49.900
the technical aspects because that technical functionality informs the way that the rest

24:49.900 --> 24:51.460
of the system behaves.

24:51.460 --> 24:56.540
In a very McLuhanist way, the machine shapes the environment around it.

24:56.540 --> 25:01.520
As already mentioned, a blockchain consists of two broad fundamental components, the ledger

25:01.520 --> 25:03.720
and the consensus mechanism.

25:03.720 --> 25:07.160
All currently popular blockchains use an append-only ledger.

25:07.160 --> 25:10.240
Now this is, on its own, not that remarkable.

25:10.240 --> 25:14.280
Append-only is just a database setting that only allows new entries to be added to the

25:14.280 --> 25:16.160
end of the current database.

25:16.160 --> 25:19.640
Once something is written to the database, it's read-only.

25:19.640 --> 25:23.560
Standard applications are typically things like activity logs, which is conceptually

25:23.560 --> 25:27.800
all a blockchain really is, a giant log of transactions.

25:27.800 --> 25:32.280
The hitch is that it's decentralized, with elective participants hosting a complete copy

25:32.280 --> 25:39.480
of the entire log, and this is where the second component comes in, the consensus mechanism.

25:39.480 --> 25:44.240
All validating participants, called nodes, have a complete copy of the database, and

25:44.240 --> 25:47.880
no one copy is considered to be the authoritative copy.

25:47.880 --> 25:52.960
Instead, there is a consensus mechanism that determines which transactions actually happened.

25:52.960 --> 25:55.280
This is all the proof-of-work stuff.

25:55.280 --> 25:59.320
Proof-of-work isn't the only consensus mechanism, but it's popular because it's very easy

25:59.400 --> 26:03.880
to implement by just cloning Bitcoin, and is resilient against the kind of attacks that

26:03.880 --> 26:05.800
crypto enthusiasts care about.

26:05.800 --> 26:10.120
It's a very brute force solution, but legitimately, if you want a network of ledgers where no

26:10.120 --> 26:15.040
one trusts anyone else, just making everyone on the network do extreme amounts of wasted

26:15.040 --> 26:17.680
duplicate work is a solution.

26:17.680 --> 26:21.160
One of the major problems that this machine solves is what's called the double spend

26:21.160 --> 26:22.160
problem.

26:22.160 --> 26:26.000
How do you stop someone from spending the same dollar twice?

26:26.000 --> 26:30.520
If someone tries, how do you determine which transaction really happened?

26:30.520 --> 26:35.160
Banks solve this problem by not correlating account balance with any specific dollar,

26:35.160 --> 26:39.880
processing transactions first come first serve, which they track with central resources, and

26:39.880 --> 26:43.040
punishing users with overdraft fees for double spending.

26:43.040 --> 26:47.720
Eschewing a central solution, cryptocurrencies rely on their consensus mechanism.

26:47.720 --> 26:52.640
The most popular alternative to proof-of-work is proof-of-stake, where validators post-collateral

26:52.640 --> 26:57.800
of some kind, usually whatever currency is endemic to the chain, with the amount of collateral

26:57.800 --> 27:03.160
determining their odds of being rewarded the validation bounty for any given transaction.

27:03.160 --> 27:07.880
The main proposal of proof-of-stake is that it significantly reduces the wasted power problems

27:07.880 --> 27:11.480
of proof-of-work, but it's less resilient than proof-of-work.

27:11.480 --> 27:16.120
On the energy cost side of things, proof-of-stake is still inefficient, just by virtue of the

27:16.120 --> 27:21.240
sheer volume of redundancy, but on a per user basis it's at least inefficient on the

27:21.240 --> 27:26.080
scale of, like, an MMO as opposed to a steel foundry.

27:26.080 --> 27:30.720
This is difficult to assess because the most popular proof-of-stake chains are still unpopular

27:30.720 --> 27:34.480
and low traffic in the scope of things, heavily centralized.

27:34.480 --> 27:38.600
Claims about scalability are backed up by nothing but the creator's word.

27:38.600 --> 27:42.260
Proof-of-stake is also significantly more complex, because there now needs to be some

27:42.260 --> 27:46.680
mechanism for determining who gets to do the validations, and also determining how audits

27:46.680 --> 27:50.360
are conducted and then the question of who has control over that system, and whether

27:50.360 --> 27:54.920
or not someone can gain control of that system or control over the whole stake via just buying

27:54.920 --> 27:58.200
out the staking pool, etc etc etc.

27:58.200 --> 28:02.800
Proof-of-stake also even more explicitly rewards the wealthy who have the capital to both stake

28:02.800 --> 28:03.800
and spend.

28:03.800 --> 28:06.680
It's also even more explicitly exclusionary.

28:06.680 --> 28:11.560
Ethereum's proposed proof-of-stake migration has a buy-in of 32 Ether, which at the time

28:11.560 --> 28:18.200
of writing is about $130,000, so really only early adopters and the wealthy can actually

28:18.200 --> 28:21.520
meaningfully participate for more than just crumbs.

28:21.520 --> 28:26.140
This is, in turn, compounding inherent problems with the long-term growth of the chain.

28:26.140 --> 28:30.600
Even if you solve the escalating power requirements of proof-of-work, the data requirements of

28:30.600 --> 28:35.840
storing the chain and participating as a validator are also prohibitive in a way that

28:35.840 --> 28:39.960
inevitably centralizes power in the hands of a few wealthy operators.

28:39.960 --> 29:09.800
The major downside of all these

29:10.200 --> 29:12.480
systems is that they're extremely slow.

29:12.480 --> 29:16.240
Proof-of-work is inefficient by design, and proof-of-stake has multiple layers of lottery

29:16.240 --> 29:21.640
that need to be executed before any transaction can be conducted, and, in particular, suffers

29:21.640 --> 29:26.280
from delays when elected validators are offline and the system needs to draw again.

29:26.280 --> 29:30.360
As an extension of being slow, they're also prone to getting overwhelmed if too many people

29:30.360 --> 29:35.600
try to make transactions simultaneously, which can cause desyncs between validators and even

29:35.760 --> 29:40.280
lead to what's called a fork, where two or more pools of validators reach a different

29:40.280 --> 29:45.800
consensus about the state of the network, and each branch keeps on going afterwards

29:45.800 --> 29:48.720
assuming that it is the authoritative version.

29:48.720 --> 29:54.200
Forks can also be caused on purpose, and this is, in fact, the only way to effectively undo

29:54.200 --> 29:55.800
transactions.

29:55.800 --> 30:00.480
Like if someone stole your coins, the only way to get them back would be to convince the

30:00.480 --> 30:05.480
people who manage the chain itself to negotiate a rollback.

30:06.360 --> 30:11.360
Now, because the nature of a fork involves a disagreement on what transactions actually

30:11.360 --> 30:16.560
happened, and who got paid for those transactions, this means that each arm of the fork has

30:16.560 --> 30:21.920
a vested interest in its own arm being the authoritative arm, so resolving forks can

30:21.920 --> 30:27.600
turn into irreconcilable schisms, which is funny as an outside observer viewing it as

30:27.600 --> 30:33.360
an inane internet drama, but is frankly unacceptable for anything posturing as a serious and legitimate

30:33.360 --> 30:34.360
currency.

30:34.360 --> 30:38.040
And it's important to stress that because of the nature of the chain, the way that the

30:38.040 --> 30:44.000
ID numbers of later blocks are dependent on the outcomes of previous blocks, these aren't

30:44.000 --> 30:49.400
just a few disputed transactions that need to be resolved between the buyer, the seller,

30:49.400 --> 30:55.760
and the payment processor, these are disagreements on the fundamental state of the entire economy

30:55.760 --> 30:59.280
that create an entire alternate reality.

30:59.280 --> 31:04.760
It's an ecosystem that absolutely demolishes consumer protections and makes the re-implementation

31:04.760 --> 31:07.280
of them extremely difficult.

31:07.280 --> 31:11.120
One of the big selling points of all this technology is that it's particularly secure,

31:11.120 --> 31:15.280
very difficult for anyone to hack it directly since there's so much redundancy.

31:15.280 --> 31:19.920
A lot of hay is made about the system's resiliency against man-in-the-middle attacks, which are

31:19.920 --> 31:22.720
your classic Hollywood hacker type attacks.

31:22.720 --> 31:27.900
Someone sends a command from point A and on the way to point B it is intercepted and altered.

31:27.900 --> 31:33.100
Someone hacks into the bank and adds an arbitrary number of zeros onto their account balance.

31:33.100 --> 31:37.180
Evangelists will commonly claim that blockchain could revolutionize the global shipping industry

31:37.180 --> 31:38.780
and reduce fraud.

31:38.780 --> 31:40.460
It's a good claim to interrogate.

31:40.460 --> 31:44.620
First, the things that blockchain is capable of tracking are things that manufacturers and

31:44.620 --> 31:48.620
shippers are already tracking, or at least trying to track.

31:48.620 --> 31:53.300
So this is not so much revolution as it would be standardization.

31:53.300 --> 31:57.780
Even that is built on a predicate assumption that everyone picks the same chain.

31:57.780 --> 32:00.540
It's an extremely optimistic assumption.

32:00.540 --> 32:05.460
Many many many firms deliberately want their information centralized and obfuscated to

32:05.460 --> 32:07.540
protect against corporate espionage.

32:07.540 --> 32:12.420
The lack of a shared standardized bucket to put all the information into is not because

32:12.420 --> 32:16.300
it's being here to for impossible, but because it's being undesirable.

32:16.300 --> 32:21.340
Second, it assumes the existence of a theoretical mechanism that ensures the synchronization

32:21.340 --> 32:27.140
of the chain and reality above and beyond the current capacity of logistics software.

32:27.140 --> 32:32.460
Problem means of preventing people from just lying to the blockchain and giving it the

32:32.460 --> 32:38.340
information it expects to be receiving, the blockchain equivalent of ripping off the shipping

32:38.340 --> 32:40.900
label and slapping it on the new box.

32:40.900 --> 32:45.380
The bigger problem here is that in the pantheon of fraud, man in the middle attacks are actually

32:45.380 --> 32:46.680
pretty rare.

32:46.680 --> 32:51.100
Global shipping needs to deal with it in certain capacities, but taken on the whole, the vast

32:51.100 --> 32:55.540
majority of fraud doesn't come from altering information as it passes between parties,

32:55.580 --> 33:00.140
rather from colluding parties entering bad information at the start.

33:00.140 --> 33:04.340
Con artists don't hack the gibson to transfer your funds to their offshore account, they

33:04.340 --> 33:06.780
convince you to give them your password.

33:06.780 --> 33:12.980
Most fraud comes from people who technically have permission to be doing what they're doing.

33:12.980 --> 33:16.500
Rather than preventing these actual common types of fraud, cryptocurrency has made them

33:16.500 --> 33:21.220
absurdly easy, and the main reason why cryptocurrency needs to be so resistant to man in the middle

33:21.220 --> 33:25.980
attacks is because the decentralized nature of the network otherwise makes them acutely

33:25.980 --> 33:28.180
vulnerable to those attacks.

33:28.180 --> 33:32.380
What this all kind of means is that blockchains are all pretty bad at doing most of the things

33:32.380 --> 33:37.700
they're trying to do, and a lot of the innovations in blockchains are attempts at solving problems

33:37.700 --> 33:39.660
that blockchains introduced.

33:39.660 --> 33:43.700
The biggest issue that cryptocurrencies have suffered from is a lack of tangible things

33:43.700 --> 33:48.020
to actually use them on as currencies, rent or food or transit.

33:48.020 --> 33:50.460
This is for pretty simple reasons.

33:50.460 --> 33:54.460
One is that the transaction fees on popular chains are so prohibitive that it's pointless

33:54.460 --> 33:58.660
to use them on any transaction that isn't hundreds if not thousands of dollars, no

33:58.660 --> 34:02.820
one is going to buy the Bitcoin bucket from their local KFC.

34:02.820 --> 34:09.660
Ethereum's main transaction fee, called gas, on a good day runs around $20 US per transaction,

34:09.660 --> 34:11.780
but that's severely optimistic.

34:11.780 --> 34:17.900
As of December 2021, the daily average cost of gas hasn't gone below $50 US since August,

34:17.900 --> 34:22.220
with a three month daily average riding over $130.

34:22.220 --> 34:24.740
And that's just the daily average.

34:24.740 --> 34:29.180
The hourly price can and does swing by up to two orders of magnitude.

34:29.180 --> 34:32.980
The throughput of blockchains is so abysmal that transaction slots are auctioned off to

34:32.980 --> 34:36.340
the highest bidder, that's why these numbers are so extreme.

34:36.340 --> 34:40.220
It only takes a few high rollers competing on a transaction to drive the hourly price

34:40.220 --> 34:43.540
of gas up over $1000 US.

34:43.540 --> 34:47.900
The internal term for this is a gas war, because it's just that common.

34:47.900 --> 34:52.300
Bots, in particular, can drive gas prices well into the tens of thousands of dollars

34:52.300 --> 34:56.320
as they compete to capitalize on mistakes, such as someone listing something for sale

34:56.320 --> 34:58.620
well below its general market price.

34:58.620 --> 35:04.300
Also, it needs to be stressed, these gas wars aren't localized to just the thing that's

35:04.300 --> 35:05.300
being fought over.

35:05.300 --> 35:10.380
If Steam is getting hammered because Concerned Ape posted Stardew Valley 2 by surprise,

35:10.380 --> 35:12.860
that will probably stay pretty well contained.

35:12.860 --> 35:16.980
If Taylor Swift concert tickets go on sale and Live Nation gets crushed, you might never

35:16.980 --> 35:18.300
even know.

35:18.300 --> 35:24.620
What those don't do is cause the cost of placing an order on drive through RPG to spike

35:24.620 --> 35:27.220
by 8000% for three hours.

35:27.220 --> 35:31.460
The second big reason is that value on the coins themselves is so volatile that unless

35:31.460 --> 35:35.500
you're willing to engage with the speculative nature of the coins, there's actually a huge

35:35.500 --> 35:38.700
risk in accepting them as payment for anything.

35:38.700 --> 35:42.980
Bitcoin, in particular, owing to its glacial transaction times, suffers from problems where

35:42.980 --> 35:48.000
the value of the coin can change dramatically between the start and end of a transaction.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.820
This is such a problem that it's led to the rise of an entire strata of middlemen in the

35:51.820 --> 35:56.820
ecosystem, so-called stablecoin exchanges like Tether that exist to quickly transfer

35:56.820 --> 36:00.400
cryptocurrencies between each other and lock in values.

36:00.400 --> 36:04.260
The stablecoins, rather than having a speculative value, have a value that's pegged to the

36:04.260 --> 36:07.740
value of an actual currency, like the euro or US dollar.

36:07.740 --> 36:11.740
The underlying problem that they exist to solve is itself twofold.

36:11.740 --> 36:15.420
One is that converting cryptocurrency into dollars is the step of the process that makes

36:15.420 --> 36:19.820
you accountable to the tax man, and the primary goal of crypto in general is to starve public

36:19.820 --> 36:21.940
services, so that's a no-go.

36:21.940 --> 36:26.260
The second is that there just aren't actually that many buyers, and there's not enough

36:26.260 --> 36:30.220
liquidity in the ecosystem to cash out big holdings.

36:30.220 --> 36:35.300
Tether, the largest stablecoin, used to advertise itself as being backed on a one-to-one basis

36:35.300 --> 36:39.540
back when it was called realcoin, but that language has become far more nebulous over

36:39.540 --> 36:42.860
time as it's become obvious that it just isn't true.

36:42.860 --> 36:46.700
This is a very complicated situation, but the short version is that the people who own

36:46.700 --> 36:51.460
Tether also own a real money exchange called Bitfinex, and there's evidence that the two

36:51.460 --> 36:56.260
services, both which require having actual dollars on hand in order to back their products

36:56.260 --> 37:00.980
and facilitate exchanges, are sharing the same pool of money, swapping it back and forth

37:00.980 --> 37:01.980
as needed.

37:01.980 --> 37:07.300
This means that at any given time, either service is potentially backed by zero dollars,

37:07.300 --> 37:11.100
or at least that's what the data implies might be the case.

37:11.100 --> 37:15.020
Point is that if you're a high roller with hundreds of millions of conceptual dollars

37:15.020 --> 37:18.940
tied up in cryptocurrency, there's a fundamental cash problem.

37:18.940 --> 37:23.340
Your holdings have inflated to tens, hundreds, or thousands of times what you put in, but

37:23.340 --> 37:26.100
that price is just theoretical.

37:26.100 --> 37:27.300
It's speculative.

37:27.300 --> 37:31.900
You have all this crypto, you can't meaningfully spend it, and there's not enough buyers

37:31.900 --> 37:33.620
for you to get it out.

37:33.620 --> 37:39.420
In order for you to cash out, you need to convince someone else to buy in.

37:39.420 --> 37:44.620
These factors, taken holistically, mean that cryptocurrency is a bigger fool's scam.

37:44.620 --> 37:49.060
There's a lot of digital ink spilt trying to outline if it's a decentralized Ponzi

37:49.060 --> 37:54.180
scheme or a pyramid scheme or some hybrid of the two, which is a taxonomical argument

37:54.180 --> 37:59.140
that I'm not here to settle, but like both of those, it's a bigger fool's scam.

37:59.140 --> 38:03.340
The whole thing operates by buying worthless assets, believing that you will later be able

38:03.340 --> 38:05.580
to sell them to a bigger fool.

38:05.580 --> 38:09.860
The entire structure of cryptocurrencies at their basic level of operation is designed

38:09.860 --> 38:14.180
to deliver the greatest rewards to the earliest adopters, regardless of if you're talking

38:14.180 --> 38:16.380
about proof of work or proof of stake.

38:16.380 --> 38:18.720
This is inherent to their being.

38:18.720 --> 38:23.580
As Stephen Deal put it, these schemes around crypto tokens cannot create or destroy actual

38:23.620 --> 38:26.020
dollars, they can only shift them around.

38:26.020 --> 38:29.900
If you sell your crypto and make a profit in dollars, it's only because someone else

38:29.900 --> 38:34.700
bought it at a higher price than you did, and then they expect to do the same, and so

38:34.700 --> 38:37.380
on and so on ad infinitum.

38:37.380 --> 38:41.760
Every dollar that comes out of cryptocurrency needs to come from a later investor putting

38:41.760 --> 38:43.220
a dollar in.

38:43.220 --> 38:47.860
Crypto investments cannot be anything but a zero sum game, and many are actually massively

38:47.860 --> 38:49.180
negative sum.

38:49.180 --> 38:53.900
In order to presume a crypto investment functions as a store of value, we must simultaneously

38:53.900 --> 38:58.940
need to suppose an infinite chain of greater fools who keep buying these assets at any

38:58.940 --> 39:03.900
irrational price and into the future forever.

39:03.900 --> 39:07.460
Alright with all that out of the way, let's talk about the ape in the room.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.260
NFTs.

39:22.260 --> 39:24.380
Non-fungible tokens.

39:24.380 --> 39:29.540
On a conceptual level, the tech acts as a sort of generic database to mediate the exchange

39:29.540 --> 39:31.560
of digital stuff.

39:31.560 --> 39:36.580
The most optimistic read on it is a framework for a type of computer code that creates so-called

39:36.580 --> 39:42.020
true digital objects, meaning digital objects that possess the attributes of both physical

39:42.020 --> 39:48.060
objects and digital, being losslessly transmittable while providing strict uniqueness, which is

39:48.060 --> 39:50.280
an important concept.

39:50.280 --> 39:55.620
Strict uniqueness is a way of saying that two different things are different things,

39:55.620 --> 39:59.700
even if they're different copies of the same thing.

39:59.700 --> 40:05.780
My copy of Gray by EL James is strictly unique, while millions of copies of the book exist.

40:05.780 --> 40:12.020
This is the only copy that is this copy, and this is the only copy that has the very specific

40:12.020 --> 40:16.900
damage of being glued shut and thrown into the bow river.

40:16.900 --> 40:18.860
It is also strictly scarce.

40:18.860 --> 40:24.340
While millions of copies of Gray exist, that's still a finite number, meaning it is possible,

40:24.340 --> 40:29.100
though not immediately practical, for the world to run out of copies.

40:29.100 --> 40:34.180
NFTs impose a simulacrum of this physical scarcity and uniqueness onto digital objects

40:34.180 --> 40:37.780
within their ecosystem.

40:37.780 --> 40:42.660
On a technical level, non-fungible token is just a token that has a unique serial number

40:42.660 --> 40:45.900
and can't be subdivided into smaller parts.

40:45.900 --> 40:51.820
Two tokens, even two that tokenize the same conceptual thing, are still strictly unique

40:51.820 --> 40:53.900
with different serial numbers.

40:53.900 --> 40:58.520
Within the context of Ethereum and its clones, these tokens are effectively a small packet

40:58.520 --> 41:01.860
of data that can contain a payload of code.

41:01.860 --> 41:05.500
It's a box that you can put a micro-program into.

41:05.500 --> 41:09.860
That micro-program is called a smart contract, a name that is so comically full of itself

41:09.860 --> 41:14.380
that I feel like it's misleading to even call them that, but I have to for simplicity's

41:14.380 --> 41:15.380
sake.

41:15.500 --> 41:19.900
Real quick, yes, that is how the inventors conceptualize the role of these things, as

41:19.900 --> 41:22.220
the unity of programming and law.

41:22.220 --> 41:26.560
The phrase Code is Law gets bandied about as an aphorism, and it's just so full of

41:26.560 --> 41:30.180
holes that we're going to be spending the next forever talking about it.

41:30.180 --> 41:32.380
Before we move into that, this is the root of it.

41:32.380 --> 41:37.100
There is a tremendous disconnect between what NFT advocates say they do and what they actually

41:37.100 --> 41:38.100
do.

41:38.100 --> 41:44.100
But, and this is very important, both the claimed functionality and the actual functionality

41:44.180 --> 41:45.620
are both bad.

41:45.620 --> 41:50.980
It's all broken, none of it works well, so the idea of it becoming the norm is terrible,

41:50.980 --> 41:55.740
but the prospect of what the world would look like if all the mythologizing and over-promising

41:55.740 --> 41:59.140
came true also super sucks.

41:59.140 --> 42:04.060
The end goal of this infamous machine is the financialization of everything.

42:04.060 --> 42:09.420
Any benefits of digital uniqueness end up being a quirk, a necessary precondition of

42:09.420 --> 42:12.420
turning everything into a stock market.

42:12.420 --> 42:17.700
There's nothing particularly offensive underpinning the concept of digital collectibles, frameworks

42:17.700 --> 42:24.140
and subcultures for forms of digital collectibles have existed for decades within various contexts,

42:24.140 --> 42:31.380
but NFTs exist to lend credibility and functionality to the cryptocurrencies that they exist on

42:31.380 --> 42:32.540
top of.

42:32.540 --> 42:34.380
Okay, okay.

42:34.380 --> 42:35.380
Code is Law.

42:35.380 --> 42:40.380
Now, what that little smart contract program does is up to the token creator.

42:40.380 --> 42:45.340
It can be a relatively sophisticated applet that allows the user to execute various commands,

42:45.340 --> 42:51.300
or it can be a plain hypertext linked to a static URL of an image, or anything in between.

42:51.300 --> 42:55.820
Most are a lot closer to static URLs than they are to functional programs.

42:55.820 --> 43:00.700
This is in part because the thing that NFTs have become synonymous with are digital artworks,

43:00.700 --> 43:04.220
but really what the token represents is arbitrary.

43:04.220 --> 43:08.860
It can be a video game item, a permission slip, a subscription, a domain name, a virus

43:08.860 --> 43:12.860
that steals all your digital stuff, or a combination of all of those.

43:12.860 --> 43:16.780
Well the concept has been floating around since 2015 when the framework was thrown together

43:16.780 --> 43:21.420
in a day during a hackathon and the first Ethereum implemented tokens were minted in

43:21.420 --> 43:22.420
2017.

43:22.420 --> 43:27.900
For the mainstream, the story starts in the spring of 2021 following a string of high

43:27.900 --> 43:34.540
priced sales of tokens minted by digital artist Beeple, culminating in a $69 million sale

43:34.540 --> 43:39.660
of a collage of Beeple's work in March via old money auction house Christie's.

43:39.660 --> 43:45.020
This high profile sale triggered a media frenzy and an online gold rush as various minor internet

43:45.020 --> 43:50.100
celebrities raced to cash in on the trend, hoping to be the next to cash out big.

43:50.100 --> 43:54.620
Over the course of about six weeks, the ecosystem burnt through just about every relevant meme

43:54.620 --> 43:55.620
possible.

43:55.620 --> 44:00.380
Laina Morris, popularized on Reddit as overly attached girlfriend, sold the original screen

44:00.380 --> 44:04.780
grab to Emirati music producer Fars and Fard and Fard for the equivalent of a little over

44:04.780 --> 44:06.940
$400,000 US.

44:06.940 --> 44:11.980
Zoe Roth, aka Disaster Girl, sold the NFT of the original Disaster Girl photograph to

44:11.980 --> 44:14.860
Fard for also $400,000.

44:14.860 --> 44:21.180
Kyle Craven sold the original Bad Luck Brian photo for $36,000 to anonymous buyer At-A.

44:21.180 --> 44:27.340
Nayan Kat sold for almost $600,000 with multiple variants also selling for six figures.

44:27.420 --> 44:33.140
Ellison Harvard sold Creepy Chan 1 and 2 for $67,000 and $83,000 respectively, also

44:33.140 --> 44:34.300
both to Fard.

44:34.300 --> 44:38.500
In addition to these high profile sales of things that were already popular, whale buyers

44:38.500 --> 44:43.860
like Fard were dropping four and five figure sales onto a random assortment of other artworks.

44:43.860 --> 44:47.940
Corporations and individuals auctioned off NFTs representing intangible, non-transferable

44:47.940 --> 44:52.260
concepts like the first tweet or the first text message.

44:52.260 --> 44:57.540
Pico Currency Evangelist jumped at every opportunity to proselytize this new, bold, revolutionary

44:57.540 --> 45:01.980
marketplace that would free artists from the yoke of the gig economy and provide buyers

45:01.980 --> 45:07.860
with an immutable record of ownership of authenticated artwork stored on an eternal distributed machine.

45:07.860 --> 45:10.980
You could be holding the next generation's Picasso.

45:10.980 --> 45:15.180
Artists could continue to earn passive revenue from secondary sales.

45:15.180 --> 45:18.060
Imagine what it'll be worth in five years.

45:18.060 --> 45:22.220
This created an error of absolute mania as it seemed like anything could be the golden

45:22.220 --> 45:23.220
ticket.

45:23.220 --> 45:26.980
Digital artists, especially those working with media like generative art that's difficult

45:26.980 --> 45:32.180
to monetize via conventional channels like physical prints, raced into the space and,

45:32.180 --> 45:34.860
on the whole, lost a lot of money.

45:34.860 --> 45:38.180
Critics began questioning what it was that was actually being bought and sold.

45:38.180 --> 45:42.620
Copyright, commercial permission, a digital file, bragging rights?

45:42.620 --> 45:46.900
In a huge number of cases the answer wasn't very clear and even the sellers caught in

45:46.900 --> 45:51.940
the promise of a payday weren't all together sure what they had even sold.

45:51.940 --> 45:56.020
Tons of the tokens did little more than point to images stored on normal servers readily

45:56.020 --> 46:01.540
accessible via HTTP, meaning the bought assets would be just as vulnerable to Linkrot as

46:01.540 --> 46:02.740
anything else.

46:02.740 --> 46:08.500
Some pointed to images stored on peer-to-peer IPFS servers, which are more resistant to

46:08.500 --> 46:14.820
Linkrot as similar to a torrent, it only requires that someone keep the file active somewhere

46:14.860 --> 46:19.580
rather than requiring the original server to stay up, but as millions of dead torrents

46:19.580 --> 46:25.220
prove that's still a far cry from the eternal storage solution that evangelists were claiming.

46:25.220 --> 46:29.580
The images were stored and delivered the same way as any other image on the internet, easily

46:29.580 --> 46:34.340
saved or duplicated simply by virtue of the fact that in order for your computer to display

46:34.340 --> 46:37.140
an image it needs to download it.

46:37.140 --> 46:43.580
Claims of digital scarcity apply only to the token itself, not the thing the token signified.

46:43.620 --> 46:48.020
More than that, there was no cryptographic relationship between the image and the tokens.

46:48.020 --> 46:52.980
The image associated with a token could be easily altered or replaced if the person with

46:52.980 --> 46:59.140
access to the server that the image was hosted on just changed file names, making the relationship

46:59.140 --> 47:04.180
between the two tenuous and flimsy in a way that undermined the claims that this was somehow

47:04.180 --> 47:09.100
a more durable, reliable way of transacting digital art.

47:09.100 --> 47:14.100
There was also no root proof of authenticity, no confirmation that the person minting the

47:14.100 --> 47:17.180
artwork was the person who created the artwork.

47:17.180 --> 47:21.740
This is a pretty handy encapsulation of the way that blockchain fails to solve the most

47:21.740 --> 47:27.260
common problems with fraud, which tend to start with bad data going into a system at

47:27.260 --> 47:31.500
the input, not data being altered midstream.

47:31.500 --> 47:35.820
Artists who complained about this system, which clearly incentivized impersonating popular

47:35.900 --> 47:41.100
artists, including deceased artists, were told that it was their fault for not jumping

47:41.100 --> 47:46.060
in sooner, that if they had bought in and minted their stuff first, then it would have

47:46.060 --> 47:48.580
been easy to prove the forgeries.

47:48.580 --> 47:52.820
Because evangelists don't see this as a tool, as a market that may or may not fit into

47:52.820 --> 47:56.220
an artist's business, they see it as the future.

47:56.220 --> 48:01.060
So failure to participate isn't a business decision, it's just a mistake.

48:01.060 --> 48:02.380
They're terrible people.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.300
All told, the frenzy collapsed pretty quickly.

48:04.300 --> 48:09.300
By June, the market had already receded by about 90%, which incidentally just further

48:09.300 --> 48:13.420
incentivized the low effort process of minting other people's artwork to the point that

48:13.420 --> 48:18.460
art platform DeviantArt implemented an extremely well-received feature that scanned several

48:18.460 --> 48:21.980
popular NFT marketplaces for matching images.

48:21.980 --> 48:25.380
The output of that is extremely depressing.

48:25.380 --> 48:29.820
Not to labor the point, but reposting digital art without attribution is nothing new.

48:29.820 --> 48:32.860
Profiting off someone else's art is also nothing new.

48:32.860 --> 48:37.460
All that's new is NFTs represent a high-energy marketplace with an irrational pricing culture

48:37.460 --> 48:41.180
where the main buyer is easily flattered and not particularly discerning.

48:41.180 --> 48:45.820
The potential payoff is extremely high, much, much higher than a bootleg red bubble store,

48:45.820 --> 48:50.580
the consequences border on non-existent, and the market is clearly in an untenable state

48:50.580 --> 48:55.620
so there's an incentive to get in at as low a cost as possible before it collapses, hence

48:55.620 --> 48:57.640
the absolute plague of art theft.

48:57.640 --> 49:01.140
Even the argument that artists could make passive revenue off secondary sales turned

49:01.220 --> 49:02.980
out to have a lot of caveats attached.

49:02.980 --> 49:07.060
One, the smart contract for the token needs to have a function that defines royalties

49:07.060 --> 49:11.340
so anyone who minted a token based off of hype, making it sound like an inherent function

49:11.340 --> 49:13.460
of the system, was out of luck.

49:13.460 --> 49:18.260
And two, the token doesn't know what a sale is and can't differentiate between being

49:18.260 --> 49:24.300
sold and being transferred, so it's actually the marketplace that informs the token you're

49:24.300 --> 49:27.140
being sold and collects the royalties.

49:27.140 --> 49:31.180
And result, royalties are easily bypassed simply by using a marketplace that doesn't

49:31.180 --> 49:35.380
collect royalties, or uses a different format of royalty collection that's incompatible

49:35.380 --> 49:37.380
with the function the token uses.

49:37.380 --> 49:41.820
While a few sellers, legitimate and otherwise, made off with undeniably big paydays, hundreds

49:41.820 --> 49:46.160
of thousands of artists bought in only to find that there wasn't a new revolutionary

49:46.160 --> 49:50.780
highly trafficked audience of digital art collectors, instead there was a closed market

49:50.780 --> 49:55.180
dealing in casino chips where the primary winners were those already connected who already

49:55.180 --> 49:59.300
had the means to get the attention of the whales in the media, a market where participation

49:59.300 --> 50:03.820
required buying into a cryptocurrency at a rapidly fluctuating price in order to pay

50:03.820 --> 50:07.780
the minting cost to post the work where it would sit unsold.

50:07.780 --> 50:11.380
This led those artists in the lurch where they had to choose between just eating the

50:11.380 --> 50:15.620
losses or attempting to convince their existing audience to buy in as well.

50:15.620 --> 50:20.380
The people who actually won were the people with large holdings of cryptocurrencies, specifically

50:20.380 --> 50:24.460
Ethereum which mediated the vast majority of these big ticket purchases.

50:24.460 --> 50:28.380
David Gerard, author of Attack of the Fifty Foot Blockchain, summarized it on his blog

50:28.380 --> 50:30.220
very succinctly as such.

50:30.220 --> 50:33.340
NFTs are entirely for the benefit of the crypto grifters.

50:33.340 --> 50:38.300
The only purpose the artists serve is as aspiring suckers to pump the concept of crypto, and

50:38.300 --> 50:42.180
of course to buy cryptocurrency to pay for minting NFTs.

50:42.180 --> 50:45.580
Sometimes the artist gets some crumbs to keep them pumping the concept of crypto.

50:45.580 --> 50:47.700
The rush benefits them in two ways.

50:47.700 --> 50:52.000
First, the price of Ether itself goes up directly from the spike in demand.

50:52.040 --> 50:56.800
In January and May, the price of Ether rose from $700 to $4,000.

50:56.800 --> 51:01.500
And second, there's new, actual buyers who aren't just trading bitcoin for tether for

51:01.500 --> 51:05.900
Ether and back again, but are buying in with dollars, providing the whole system with the

51:05.900 --> 51:09.400
liquidity needed for whales to actually cash out.

51:09.400 --> 51:14.160
This arrangement, needing to buy a highly volatile coin from people who paid far far

51:14.160 --> 51:19.080
less for it in order to participate in a market that they control, is why people reflexively

51:19.080 --> 51:21.240
describe the whole arrangement as a scam.

51:21.240 --> 51:26.560
If you buy in at $4,000 and compete against people who bought in at $4, you're the sucker.

51:26.560 --> 51:30.680
It reveals the basic truth that these aren't marketplaces, they're casinos.

51:30.680 --> 51:35.200
And indeed, even through all the rhetoric of protecting artists and whatnot was the ever-present

51:35.200 --> 51:37.000
specter of the gamble.

51:37.000 --> 51:41.680
Whatever you buy now might be worth hundreds of times more later, constantly invoked as

51:41.680 --> 51:44.520
the opposite proposition of the bad deal.

51:44.520 --> 51:48.880
What if you had been the person who bought in at $4?

51:48.880 --> 51:54.320
Let's take a closer look at that eye-watering $69 million Beeple sale.

51:54.320 --> 51:58.400
Independent journalist Amy Castor has done an enviable job running down the details here

51:58.400 --> 52:04.040
in her piece MetaCovin, the Mystery Beeple Art Buyer and his NFT DeFi Scheme.

52:04.040 --> 52:07.480
But to summarize it along as short of her notes, the buyer is a crypto entrepreneur named

52:07.480 --> 52:11.880
Vignesh Sundaresan who purchased the piece to boost the reputation and value of his own

52:11.880 --> 52:18.360
crypto investment scheme Metapurse and Metapurse's own token, B20, which Beeple owns 2% of the

52:18.360 --> 52:20.280
total supply of.

52:20.280 --> 52:25.560
Following the Christie sale, the reported value of B20 went from 36 cents per token

52:25.560 --> 52:27.560
to $23.

52:27.560 --> 52:29.880
And that's just the anatomy of a single sale.

52:29.880 --> 52:34.480
The very obvious conclusion observers reached was that none of this is about the art at

52:34.480 --> 52:37.160
all, but the speculative value.

52:37.160 --> 52:41.320
Not what it's worth to you, but what it'll potentially be worth in the future to someone

52:41.320 --> 52:42.320
else.

52:42.320 --> 52:45.800
It's not a market, it's a casino, gambling on the receipt for an image or video that

52:45.800 --> 52:48.080
otherwise infinitely digitally replicable.

52:48.080 --> 52:53.040
The thing itself is immaterial as long as it can make a line go up.

52:53.040 --> 52:58.080
This is the essence of the market and a microcosm of what evangelists imagine they want to see

52:58.080 --> 53:01.640
as the future, the financialization of everything.

53:01.640 --> 53:05.880
The frenzied market around old Reddit memes was doomed from the start, there's a finite

53:05.880 --> 53:11.920
supply of meaningful originals, so to keep this thing going, to keep the line going up,

53:11.920 --> 53:17.320
you need something more, something less tied to anything specific.

53:17.560 --> 53:20.320
Sir, the Lambo's ready.

53:20.320 --> 53:21.320
What?

53:24.320 --> 53:28.120
In the months since the initial craze, the marketplace had mutated.

53:28.120 --> 53:32.400
The it thing was no longer memes or digital works from established artists, but character

53:32.400 --> 53:37.320
profiles from large, procedurally generated collections with names like CryptoPunks, Bored

53:37.320 --> 53:42.800
Ape Yacht Club, Lazy Lions, Cool Cats, Ethergals, Gatorworld, Baby Lana Club, Magic Mushroom

53:42.800 --> 53:46.000
Club, Rogue Society Bot, and Crypto Chicks.

53:46.000 --> 53:50.720
These were notable for, again, commanding utterly irrational prices, seemingly completely

53:50.720 --> 53:57.760
decoupled from any legitimate or legal transaction, and being generally extremely fuggly.

53:57.760 --> 54:02.280
This surge generated an immediately adversarial relationship between the buyers, who touted

54:02.280 --> 54:07.280
them as both evidence of their extravagant wealth and their foresight into the future

54:07.280 --> 54:11.400
of digital economies, and pretty much everyone else.

54:11.400 --> 54:16.200
A very common response to anyone using one of these profile pics, or ragging about their

54:16.200 --> 54:21.160
purchase, became saving and reposting the image in reply, or even changing profile

54:21.160 --> 54:22.600
pics to match.

54:22.600 --> 54:26.520
Spurred by a speculative tweet from Twitter developers suggesting that they were working

54:26.520 --> 54:32.080
on an NFT verification system, Twitter users broadly rallied at the opportunity to immediately

54:32.080 --> 54:34.880
identify people that it was okay to bully.

54:34.880 --> 54:39.160
Tweets from within the crypto sphere started leaking out, things like Santiago Santos tweeting

54:39.160 --> 54:45.120
things like, NFTs equal Identity 2.0, can't remember the last time I used my pic on the

54:45.120 --> 54:51.400
left, emphasis on physical traits, genetic lottery, prone to bias and prejudice, identity

54:51.400 --> 54:57.080
by choice, unique and digitally scarce, representation of values and beliefs.

54:57.080 --> 55:02.800
Of course what Santiago was leaving out was that he had paid the equivalent of $171,000

55:02.800 --> 55:08.840
US for that profile pic, which probably gives him some incentive to really commit to it

55:08.840 --> 55:14.960
as something interesting and special, even though stripped to the studs, literally all

55:14.960 --> 55:20.360
he was describing was using a non-representational image as a profile pic.

55:20.360 --> 55:27.080
For about six years, my profile on the Dungeons & Dragons forums was a stock photo of a cabbage,

55:27.080 --> 55:31.080
so not really breaking new ground here.

55:31.080 --> 55:36.520
Greg Eisenberg sat at his computer and decided to bang out most people who make fun of NFTs,

55:36.520 --> 55:42.160
own zero NFTs, have never minted an NFT, have never participated in a community, have never

55:42.160 --> 55:47.800
staked their NFT, haven't built on top of an NFT project, have never earned an NFT playing

55:47.800 --> 55:51.600
a game, missed out on bake, punks, cool cats, etc.

55:51.600 --> 55:56.840
A chain of logic implying that skeptics of the market are just uninformed sore losers.

55:56.840 --> 56:01.000
Incidents like these lent to the very accurate perception that the loudest voices in NFTs

56:01.000 --> 56:05.680
weren't very familiar with internet culture as a whole, weren't terribly smart in general,

56:05.680 --> 56:10.000
and were by and large coming at all this from the financial side, further supported by all

56:10.000 --> 56:14.160
of them having tweets or not investment advice in their Twitter bios.

56:14.160 --> 56:17.480
In short, the same people who made and bought Juicero.

56:17.480 --> 56:20.480
What is this?

56:20.480 --> 56:22.960
It's a Juicero.

56:22.960 --> 56:26.320
It also laid bare that the conversations were inherently suspect.

56:26.320 --> 56:32.560
How can you ever trust the sincerity of someone telling you how awesome their $171,000 investment

56:32.560 --> 56:38.960
is when your persuasion stands to directly benefit them by potentially driving up the

56:38.960 --> 56:41.400
value of their investment portfolio?

56:41.400 --> 56:49.320
You've got to be extremely rich for $171,000 to not be an extremely sunk cost, and that's

56:49.320 --> 56:54.000
absolutely going to weigh on your mind and influence how you see the market.

56:54.000 --> 56:58.040
So for my part, I tweeted about several of these incidences and was in response hounded

56:58.120 --> 57:02.840
for days by annoying people with NFT profile pics who insisted that I just didn't get

57:02.840 --> 57:03.840
it.

57:03.840 --> 57:06.000
I wasn't seeing the community.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
So I decided to go see the community.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.480
My experiment started with the Cool Cats Discord.

57:10.480 --> 57:14.200
One of the communities that I'd been assured was top of the pile.

57:14.200 --> 57:20.160
I joined, read back through days and days of conversation logs, watched the active conversations,

57:20.160 --> 57:22.680
and was generally unimpressed.

57:22.680 --> 57:24.360
It was at best unremarkable.

57:24.360 --> 57:28.840
A primary concern was still rooted in the monetary value of the tokens.

57:28.840 --> 57:32.520
If you spend $1,000,000 on a cat, it's not just for Twitter and no one would be happy

57:32.520 --> 57:35.280
seeing someone mint another one later for free.

57:35.280 --> 57:41.440
That's why punks are at $120,000, symbols, memes, there's the value.

57:41.440 --> 57:45.880
What wasn't unremarkable is the way that I was immediately deluged by bots sending

57:45.880 --> 57:48.080
me invites to other discords.

57:48.080 --> 57:53.440
So between the spam I was receiving and the Cool Cats dedicated shill channel, I came

57:53.440 --> 58:13.080
up with an idea.

58:13.080 --> 58:18.200
For days now I've been accepting every spam NFT Discord invite I've received, and it's

58:18.200 --> 58:19.440
getting dire.

58:19.440 --> 58:24.240
Stoner Cats, Oni Ronan, Magic Mushroom Club, NF Tits, The Humanoids, EtherGal's, Cool

58:24.240 --> 58:28.800

58:28.800 --> 58:34.520

Colony, Skellef T's, Daffy Panda, Ganging Up, Bedding Kong's, Wolves of Wall Street,

58:57.440 --> 59:02.240
Happy Sharks, T-Cup Pig's, Cool Lama's, Mad Carrot Gang, Barnyard Fashionista's, Soul

59:02.240 --> 59:08.480
City's, Oink Club, Outlaw Punk's, Crypto Astronauts, NFT World's, Panda Paradise, Time Traveler's,

59:08.480 --> 59:13.280
Cyber Kong's, Party 8 Billionaire Club, J Corp's, Crypto Kottos, Meta Birds, and that's

59:13.280 --> 59:17.920
about as far as I got before more or less giving up and finally shutting off Discord

59:17.920 --> 59:18.920
DMs.

59:18.920 --> 59:23.600
Now this is a fraction of a fraction of what's out there, but I do think it's a pretty

59:23.600 --> 59:26.960
representative sample, and I learned a lot.

59:26.960 --> 59:31.600
For example, the basic psychological profile of the average buyer is someone who is tenuously

59:31.600 --> 59:35.600
middle class, socially isolated, and highly responsive to memes.

59:35.600 --> 59:40.280
They are someone who has very little experience with real businesses and production processes,

59:40.280 --> 59:45.120
thus are unlikely to be turned off by unrealistic claims about future returns.

59:45.120 --> 59:50.160
They are insecure about their lack of knowledge, and this makes them very susceptible to flattery,

59:50.160 --> 59:55.400
in particular being assured that the only reason for negativity is because critics just

59:55.400 --> 59:58.040
don't understand what they understand.

59:58.040 --> 01:00:02.640
Being tenuously middle class gives them enough disposable income to engage with a pretty expensive

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:07.840
system but also a very potent anxiety about their financial future.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.480
It goes without saying that they're fixated on money and they principally understand the

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.760
technology as a means of making money.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.760
Criticism of the system is typically met with confusion.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.760
Don't you want to make money?

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:24.800
I also learned a lot about fraud and how to do it both on purpose and by accident.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:29.400
The term rug pull, with its derivations rug and rug, all to describe projects that made

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:34.560
big promises but then took the money and ran, embedded themselves in my vocabulary extremely

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.560
quickly.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:38.720
It's just absolutely lousy with fraud and deception.

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.280
Wash trading, where you sell something to your own sock puppets in order to lure in

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.920
real buyers who think they're getting a good deal, is rampant.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:50.200
Market manipulation is so common and accepted that it's actually considered bad form if

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.840
project leaders don't actively engage in it.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.520
Like it's considered disrespectful to the buyers if the project leaders don't help

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:00.120
them inflate the resale price.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:05.120
Also, and I really should not leave this merely implied, the art is bad, but not in any sort

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.520
of interesting way.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.880
It's bad in a smoothed over copycat way, a low effort garbage dump from artists who

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:14.240
have largely given up on having ideas or opinions.

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.880
Derivative, lazy, ugly, hollow, and boring.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.320
The capacity for original thought, long having been drained out of the illustrators, kept

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:24.520
in the employ and proximity of people who refused to shut up about cryptocurrency, there was

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:29.200
an overwhelming tendency to fall back on stale memes and self-flattery.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:34.600
A massive volume of cryptocurrency art ends up being art about cryptocurrency, transparent

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:39.280
pandering to an audience that is either deeply stupid or easily pleased and quite possibly

01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.280
both.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.800
Absent any artistic insight, the vacuum is instead filled overflowing with references

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.800
to doge memes, bitcoin, ethereum, stonks, to the moon, by the dip, good morning, and

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.600
desperate pleas for senpai Elon Musk to notice them, all presented with the earnestness and

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.000
authenticity of a pickle-rick bong.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.280
It's tempting to say that my approach, accepting every spam invite, was a really flawed way

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:05.320
to delve deeper, that obviously accepting invites from spam bots would mainly lead me

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:09.480
into less stable projects, but surprisingly no.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:14.120
I got just as much spam for successful projects as humanoids and NFT worlds as I did for

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.000
rug pulls like crypto astronauts and hoodpunks.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.720
On the whole, if you just look at the pitch package and the sample product, there's very

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:24.800
little material difference between a project that's going to sell out 10,000 tokens in

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:28.840
six hours and one that's going to become a trash fire as the project leader has a nervous

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:33.600
breakdown and burns the mint three days post-launch after only selling 800 tokens.

01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:38.080
Party 8 billionaire clubs sold out, bringing in about $3.2 million and are now flexing

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:42.600
their wealth by partnering with other crypto projects like the two-chains-produced NFT

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:48.720
cartoon show The Red Ape Family, which is just really truly shows off the community's deep

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:53.320
pockets and commitment to quality.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:57.800
Deep in their roadmap is the promise that they will start production on an MMORPG, a

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:00.920
claim that buyers are entirely faithful in.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:09.440
Crypto astronauts sold 1,262 of their 9,485 tokens, bringing in an impressive $375,000,

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.520
but as nice as that number is, it's not remotely enough to even start proceeding on their plan

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:16.320
to build a full-scale PVP-based MMO.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.680
Following the failed mint in October, the dev slowly went quiet and then bit by bit,

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:25.600
website, social media accounts, and eventually the Discord itself all disappeared.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:31.240
Based off the ostensible product, why should one of these succeed and the other fail?

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:35.680
The key distinction ultimately between a party 8 billionaire club and crypto astronauts

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:40.560
is that P.A.B.C. was already flushed with cash and able to manufacture hype with high-priced

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:45.320
giveaways and expensive advertising, buying advertising space in Times Square in particular

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.200
as a specific fixation.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:51.360
But running a 10-second ad every 8 minutes on one out-of-the-way billboard in Times Square

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:54.040
isn't effective advertising, not externally.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:59.200
All it's really good for is internal propaganda, making insiders feel like the money they've

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.360
spent is buying credibility.

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.400
And if you're in a speculative bubble, betting that someone down the line will buy you out

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:15.400
for more than you bought in, credibility is worth everything in the world.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.480
This is pervasive.

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:21.280
Even in the most established projects, ones that have been going for years, there's not

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:24.240
really an underlying thing.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.160
These aren't fandoms in the way that you would experience them around a game or a TV

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.500
show or a book.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:34.160
The product is pretty insubstantial, if not functionally non-existent.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:38.040
This is where these projects diverged significantly from the artworks that drove the speculative

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.640
mania in the spring.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:44.000
They're not positioning themselves as art that's worth possessing for the art, as flimsy

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.800
and illusory as that claim was, but as ongoing projects that you buy into.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:55.240
The purchase of a token is an abstracted version of buying early stock in a company, a venture

01:04:55.240 --> 01:05:00.440
capital style investment in promises, which is a very significant mutation.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:05.120
Okay, so what do these phantom companies claim to exist to do?

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:09.760
Pretty much all of them promise direct financial returns in some way, shape, or form.

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:13.840
Sometimes this is just a nebulous sense that the whole thing will go to the moon, meaning

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:17.760
the value of the tokens will take off and thus early buyers will be able to resell for

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:23.120
huge profits, or more direct as the project leaders promised the formation of, effectively,

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:28.080
an unofficial hedge fund investing a communal pool into other crypto products.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:32.000
Probably the funniest of all of these was Betting Kongs, which wanted to create an unregistered

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.640
real money casino in which token holders would be explicitly part-owners and also permitted

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.640
to gamble in the casino that they owned.

01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:44.960
Betting Kongs is not your ordinary NFT project.

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:50.840
We aim to create passive income for our NFT owners by co-owning a casino with a profit

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:51.840
split.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.680
Welcome to the White Paper, fellow gamblers.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.360
Why are we doing this?

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:02.640
To put it short, we love gambling and we noticed how a lot of the operators are at their own

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:09.000
by large corporations who have no care for the community or the service they provide.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.640
We want to provide a project where everyone playing can be a co-owner of the place they're

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:17.080
playing at and make money from it all.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:22.040
Failure was probably the best outcome for everyone here, if we're being honest.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:27.480
Some promise this in the form of a more conventional media project like a comic book or a cartoon

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:30.600
or a movie or all of the above.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:37.400
We have planned the creation of a series of comics dedicated to the pixel girl.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:43.360
The key image is static, or at least we think so now, but the squeaky girl is still a seductress

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:50.320
so the image of breasts will be presented in various variations that our community will

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:51.320
approve.

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:55.880
Let's imagine there are 5,000 NF Tits holders.

01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:00.200
There is a 30 million market of comics lovers in the US.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:06.080
On average, every comic lover spends around 20 USD per comic per week.

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:11.400
It means 80 dollars per month and 960 dollars per year.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:20.400
The total addressable market is worth 28,800,000,000 USD.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.720
Let's imagine we take 1% of this market.

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:36.120
It's 288,000,000 USD per year on the base of monthly subscriptions raised in crypto.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.760
This is a cash flow.

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:43.400
Nice to see some active communication and appreciate the effort as announced this afternoon

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.560
trying to resurrect this project into something successful.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:51.120
The only thing I would like to see, assuming the project can be successfully turned around,

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:55.520
is to perhaps, in addition to some revenue sharing, have some revenue donated to breast

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.800
cancer research.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:00.640
To truly enjoy them, we should keep them happy and healthy.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:07.240
As already implied, many of them promise video games, often an MMO, but just as often, like,

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.000
the concept of a video game?

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.480
Okay, wait, let me word that another way.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.920
They will promise a video game.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.240
Like that's the promise, in its entirety.

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:23.960
No clues for genre, style, scope, engine or platform or how any of the tokens would interact

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:24.960
with it.

01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.280
Just a video game.

01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:31.520
If we sell 10,000 tokens for 300 dollars each, we will start brainstorming development

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.160
ideas for a video game.

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:38.400
Now all of these tend to be in collections of 10,000, and there's actually an interesting

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.240
sort of quirk inside that.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:45.400
The initial format was to mint an entire collection and just shove them out onto the market.

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:50.200
The cap comes into play purely because you have to tell the program generating the garbage

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.600
when to stop.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:56.560
However, as the scheme started to take off and competition rose, it became obvious that

01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:02.280
this was a suckers way of doing it because that meant paying gas fees on everything upfront.

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:06.480
So someone came up with a system for minting a random output on demand, which shuffles

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:09.280
the mint cost off onto the buyer.

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:12.040
From there it all took off like wildfire.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:16.840
Very low upfront cost, extremely low risk, plus it turns the entire system into a gotcha

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:20.040
game with different rarity curves for attributes.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:25.240
At best, these are all obfuscated gambling schemes, at worst, active scams.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:31.960
And the payoff of failure makes it extremely difficult to parse one of those from the other.

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:38.800
World of Wojak only sold 20 tokens to 11 people and still pocketed over $5,000.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:45.480
Pro Camel Riders sold 114 tokens to 71 buyers and took home $25,000.

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:55.360
Metamon sold 722 of their 9999 tokens to 343 buyers and walked off with $211,000.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:01.800
Because the average buy-in is over 350 bucks, the payday for failure makes it irrational

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:03.400
to succeed.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:07.200
The interesting aspect of it, though, is the emergent fiction of it.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:11.600
These smoke vendors don't have an actual product more complex than the output of a vending

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:16.880
machine in the front of a grocery store, so they need a story to sell instead.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:21.520
And so we get this wave of poorly defined projects pitching a token with an attached

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:26.000
JPEG that represents the concept of a thing that could become a future business.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.960
What that business does is unimportant, and indeed many of these projects, successful

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:36.040
and otherwise, trade in a flattering myth of decentralization where the direction

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:41.920
of the business down to its fundamental product is shunted into the indeterminate future to

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:45.160
be decided later by collective consensus.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:51.200
Are we a comic book, a movie, a hedge fund, a casino, or a bimonthly curated box of snacks?

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:54.080
Well, that's for the token holders to decide.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:59.680
All that matters is that whatever it is, it will definitely make the value of your tokens

01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:04.560
go up, so you should definitely buy two.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:08.840
One thing I learned about NFTs, if you think something's going to be a blue chip, you should

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.400
definitely buy at least two, because you're going to get one emotionally attached to one

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:16.600
of them, and you're not going to want to sell it because NFTs are going to explode all over

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:17.760
the world.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:22.800
And if you've got a blue chip today, it's going to be incredibly more valuable in five

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:26.880
years from now, or even three years from now, or even two years from now than it is today.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:31.040
On the front of otherwise respectable, or at least established, brands and people getting

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:36.400
into NFTs, the results tend to be extremely tepid and insubstantial, even by the standards

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:37.800
of NFTs.

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:42.680
Very low risk, low quality, low engagement tokens, shoveled out the door to capitalize

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:51.640
on a hot buzzword, chasing the cash that's sloshing around.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:56.360
Tied up in all of this, there's an extremely pervasive resistance to any form of skepticism

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.880
that ultimately manifests as a sort of toxic positivity.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:02.600
This is all part of a complex feedback loop.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:07.600
The projects, broadly speaking, lack any kind of substantial product, existing almost entirely

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:13.080
as promises backed by nothing more than a screenshot of a roadmap and some sample PFPs.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:16.520
And again, I think it's really important to keep in mind that that goes for successful

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.960
projects just as much as for rug pulls.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:22.840
There really isn't any meaningful difference between a party-ape billionaire club and a

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.840
betting Kongs.

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.360
Betting Kongs were never going to make a casino, even if they hadn't tanked, and despite the

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:34.360
fact that they were running billboards in Times Square, P-A-B-C is never making an MMORPG.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:39.120
Both claims are equally ridiculous, but one of the two made a huge pile of money.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.760
The primary product is ultimately hype, which is both insubstantial and fickle.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:48.460
Negativity, both internal and external, can have a meaningful impact on the willingness

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:53.880
of people to buy into a project, and if buyers are tepid then you won't get a runaway sale,

01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:58.240
and if you don't get a runaway sale then that's going to turn off buyers even more,

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:03.080
which means the secondary market for tokens will likely fail to materialize.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:06.040
This is what makes enthusiasts so deeply unreliable.

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:10.680
They have meaningful financial stakes and an intangible, volatile thing that exists entirely

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:16.280
as a collective idiom, a story about a potential future outcome whose value is based entirely

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:17.880
on public perception.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:22.320
You can't trust what they have to say because they're currently holding a hot potato, and

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:27.120
as much as they insist that they just really, really enjoy the feeling of a burning hot

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:30.000
potato in their hands, do they?

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.120
Or are they just hoping that you'll catch it?

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:36.200
This creates an environment of toxic positivity where doubt is aggressively policed by both

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:40.480
project leaders who have an obvious financial interest in hype since their big payday is

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:45.760
the minting rush, and community members themselves who have a speculative financial interest in

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:46.760
hype.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:50.800
While all of that is logical in the pure sense that there is an effect that can be explained

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:56.120
by an incentive, the output is effectively a self-organizing high-control group.

01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:00.980
Doubters are ostracized so aggressively that it chills all conversation about a project's

01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:02.700
actual viability.

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:07.460
All concerns are just fud, fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:11.620
Questions that would be utterly banal in any other investment forum, what has the team

01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:12.620
done?

01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:13.620
What assets do they have?

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:18.700
Why should anyone believe that they can deliver on their promises are treated as hostile?

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:22.100
And the Frank reality is because there aren't answers.

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:28.160
Party 8 Billionaire Club is just as vaporous, and yet they superficially succeeded, so there's

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:31.800
incentive to enforce the collective illusion.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:36.040
This is multiplied by an internal form of performative etiquette.

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:39.440
Participants ritualistically wish each other good morning and good night, boiled down to

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.560
the shorthand GM and GM.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:46.320
That seems like a small thing, there's nothing inherently suspicious about good morning or

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:50.920
good night, but in observed practice it's a very distinct ritual.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:56.200
Not merely a shibboleth, but a repetitive action that signals in-group membership and

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.060
affirms loyalty on an ongoing basis.

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:03.480
If you have diamond hands, it means you're willing to hold a token until some promised

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:06.080
future where the value goes to the moon.

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:11.180
You're not a paper hands loser who is easily spooked by instability, volatility, or the

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:15.240
fact that there's no reason to believe that anyone is ever going to want to buy a crypto

01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.920
astronaut in the future.

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:22.100
The shorthand WAGMI, we're all going to make it, is aphoristically bandied about even

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:28.340
in openly zero-sum competitions where, by definition, most participants explicitly won't

01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:29.340
make it.

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:34.060
But you can't point that out, because that would be fud, and if you're spreading fud

01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:40.140
then your NGMI not going to make it, and making it, getting rich, is all that matters.

01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:43.720
HFSP have fun staying poor.

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.940
These are synthesized into a no-true Scotsman paradigm.

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:51.600
The WE in we're all going to make it does not refer to we all.

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:55.940
It refers to the select, the chosen, the diamond hands, and the hodlers.

01:15:55.940 --> 01:16:00.960
Those who make it are clearly the we, and if you didn't make it, then you weren't.

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:06.720
People who get angry about being scammed by a rug pole, or by malware, or by social engineering

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:10.160
are berated and belittled for not following the crowd.

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:14.900
This incubates a community trained to ignore warning signs and dismiss criticism, a community

01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:20.880
with internal language and customs that are explicitly incompatible with outside communications.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.920
This is fud from non-believers who are trying to undermine the value of your assets and

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:28.360
manipulate a crash or trick you into being a paperhands.

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:34.260
It all maps onto narratives of sin and deception, a chosen few who are privileged with advanced

01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:39.060
knowledge about the promised land which they can achieve by holding strong to the rituals

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:40.860
and expelling all doubt.

01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:44.860
The end product is a self-organizing high-control group.

01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:46.880
And the results of that are obvious.

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:51.860
There are still people convinced that somehow, someone is going to pick up the ashes of evolved

01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:57.380
apes and manifest the rest of the project, a belief based on no observable evidence.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:24.580
So the question then is, what do the tokens actually do?

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:29.300
As mentioned before, the token itself is just a box that a bit of data can be put into.

01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:33.540
Now this box is extremely small, to the point that even an average cell phone photograph

01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:35.900
is several times too large to fit.

01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:40.820
Due to the nature of the chain, updating software that's put onto the chain is both difficult

01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:42.700
and expensive.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:47.240
These programs need to be broken up into multiple tokens each containing a smart contract that

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:51.720
defines a portion of the whole, and all of these contracts need to interlink and reference

01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:58.320
each other, but with an eye towards the fact that each transaction that either computes

01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:02.800
or alters information requires paying processing fees.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.560
Only reading information is free.

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:10.080
The process of fixing a bug in a smart contract basically amounts to minting a new copy of

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:14.980
the contract, and then jumping through some hoops to rename the old and new contracts

01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:19.860
so that the new copy has the name that any other interacting contracts are looking for,

01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:23.620
paying fees for just about every step of that process.

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:28.420
This creates a very funny catch 22, where on one hand is the insistence that the NFTs

01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:33.740
that end users buy are potentially extremely powerful, able to be miniature self-governing

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:39.760
applets that exist in a web of like applets, and on the other hand is a large stack of

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:43.360
incentives to put as little into them as possible.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:47.880
For an example of the pitfalls, Wolf Game was a somewhat popular NFT-based gambling

01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:53.160
game that bragged about being hosted entirely on chain at great expense.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:57.800
Everything from the pixel art wolves and sheep to the game's code was stored on Ethereum.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:02.920
The idea behind the game is that users would mint a character token which had a 90% chance

01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:07.620
of being a sheep, and a 10% chance of being a wolf, with a finite supply of wolves and

01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:09.060
sheep available.

01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:14.380
The important thing here is that the character tokens weren't just a bit of art and a serial

01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:19.860
number, but tiny programs that allowed users to perform interactions like staking.

01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:24.500
The problem is that their code was full of multiple bugs, and since some of those bugs

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:33.320
were contained in the character tokens, they were replicated across all 13,809 minted tokens.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:36.120
A glitchy token can't be patched.

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.800
It must be replaced.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:44.000
So the wolf game devs were forced to not only redeploy all their contracts, but attempt

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:50.280
to remint and distribute identical copies of every token generated.

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.200
It didn't go well.

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:56.940
Given the risks inherent in putting functionality inside the token itself, and the high cost

01:19:56.940 --> 01:20:02.340
of interaction, the most common application is to use external systems to simply check

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:04.660
for possession of a token.

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:10.100
This is where we introduce another player into the ecosystem, wallet managers like MetaMask.

01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:14.420
In a few short years, the system has already grown so bloated and difficult to interact

01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:18.860
with that it's become necessary to develop middleware applications that simplify the

01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:23.920
process of generating wallets, switching wallets, and mediating handshakes between the wallet

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.760
and external systems.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:29.960
From one point of view, these wallet managers are the golden key that makes it all work.

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:35.240
They solve the single sign-on problem, allowing your web browser to simply know that it's

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:40.240
you who is using it, automatically negotiating permissions based on relevant tokens.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:44.560
It's your login, your credit card, your Steam profile, and your bank account all rolled

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:51.780
into a single point of contact, making interaction with Web3 the internet of the future frictionless.

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:56.500
From another point of view, it's a massive point of failure that contains so much information,

01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:01.100
so many permissions, so much of worth, that it becomes an extremely obvious point of attack,

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:05.860
manufactured by idiots who claim to be building a security product in 2021 that doesn't obfuscate

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:10.060
key phrases within the UI or use two-factor authentication.

01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:14.020
Remember, again, that these people want to put medical records, driver's licenses, professional

01:21:14.020 --> 01:21:16.720
accreditations, and real estate deeds into their system.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:18.120
They should not be trusted.

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:22.280
The entire market is absolutely lousy with scams, and has been since Bitcoin first gained

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.560
any traction.

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:28.040
Every single scam structure imaginable has been dusted off and redeployed into this explicitly

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:31.880
unregulated market where victims are largely without recourse.

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:36.000
These range from institutional scams like Ponzi schemes, pump and dumps, and insider

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.200
trading, to middleweight scams like gold, brick, and wash trading, to grittier scams

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:44.000
like phishing and sending fake links.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.780
Pump and dumps in particular are conducted in broad daylight, since it's not illegal,

01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:51.620
it's just against the terms of service of the exchanges that you use to do it, so the

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:54.140
worst case scenario is you burn your account.

01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:58.860
They'll straight up walk you through the process of doing a pump and dump, no code words, diagrams,

01:21:58.860 --> 01:21:59.860
and everything.

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:04.660
They're notable as they're actually a two-headed scam, because you see, you might get recruited

01:22:04.660 --> 01:22:10.580
onto the pump half of the scheme, or you might think you're being recruited to pump, but

01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:12.460
you're actually the dump.

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:16.800
As already mentioned, blockchain is resilient to direct man-in-the-middle attacks, or someone

01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:21.360
tries to inject bad data straight into the chain, but man-in-the-middle attacks are

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:22.360
rare.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:27.080
In an environment like cryptocurrency, with few, if any, repercussions for misbehavior

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:32.280
that stays within the crypto sphere, man-in-the-middle attacks are wholly unnecessary.

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:37.320
Why try to brute force your bad data onto the chain when you can trick someone into giving

01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:41.040
you access to their wallet, then transfer all their stuff out?

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:45.820
Every smart contract becomes a self-rewarding bug bounty, where the payout is whatever apes

01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:48.780
and coins you can grab before anyone notices.

01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:51.340
And that's not even touching on the subject of malware.

01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:52.740
Smart contracts are just code.

01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:53.740
They're software.

01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:56.380
There's no reason they can't be viruses or worms.

01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:59.220
The primary limitation is processing power.

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:05.460
But also, it's a virus that someone can drop directly into your bankless bank account and

01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.740
just wait for you to activate it.

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:09.180
And yeah, that's right.

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:13.680
There's no offer slash confirmation step in sending tokens back and forth.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:16.920
Someone who knows your wallet can just drop stuff right into it.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:20.240
So like, pin that somewhere in your brain.

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:24.200
The best part about this is that the whole ecosystem operates on a strict assumption

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:28.800
that possession is ownership and access is permission.

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:33.000
Which is absolutely buck wild, coming from software developers claimed to be very concerned

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.240
with system security.

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:38.520
If someone tricks you into sending them your board ape, it's now theirs.

01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:42.620
The only mechanism in the machine for parsing legitimate transactions from illegitimate

01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:46.900
transactions is the consensus mechanism, which is only concerned with whether or not the

01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:50.300
transactions followed the rules of the software.

01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:55.580
The only illegitimacy it recognizes are people trying to insert fake data.

01:23:55.580 --> 01:24:00.900
When you are tricked into doing something, all of the mechanics of what follows are,

01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:03.660
by the rules of the system, legitimate.

01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:05.140
It's a legal transfer.

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:08.580
More relevant, however, is the sheer density of these scams.

01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:13.360
The one market that cryptocurrency has successfully disrupted is the market of fraud.

01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:17.320
Think of it this way, a big population of people have willingly self-identified that

01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:23.080
they have substantial disposable income, poor judgment, low social literacy, a high tolerance

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:26.640
for nonsensical risk, and are highly persuadable.

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.680
People who fall victim to these scams have basically no options other than taking to

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:35.620
social media and attempting to whip up enough of a frenzy that they can convince marketplaces

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:40.340
like OpenSea to act as de facto sensors by delisting stolen tokens.

01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:44.980
There is no authority you can report them to that has the power to return your tokens.

01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:51.540
The best you can hope for is denying the scammer's profit on their incredibly low-cost operation.

01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:56.660
If your business is tricking people out of their money, you would be a fool if you didn't

01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:58.220
take the opportunity.

01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:02.720
Not only have participants advertised their susceptibility to incoherent promises of

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:07.400
future returns, the immutable structure of the chain, the persistence of data, and the

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:13.640
ease with which that data can be collated means that for scammers, it's extremely easy

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.320
to find marks.

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:20.280
Every discord for a rugpull NFT project is a roster of potential victims.

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:24.520
The ledger of bakeholders is a shopping list of targets.

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:28.740
The twitter account of anyone complaining about what they lost on evolved apes is the

01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:32.420
low hanging fruit of a very ripe orchard.

01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:41.300
And that's a pretty good segue into talking about privacy issues.

01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:45.020
A low trust environment is also a low privacy environment.

01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:50.180
Anything you do on a blockchain is, by design, accessible to everyone who knows how to navigate

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:51.180
the data.

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:56.000
You might be thinking, isn't that the opposite of how it's supposed to work?

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.080
I thought crypto was all anonymous.

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:02.680
So yes, crypto is anonymous by default.

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:08.440
There's no inherent requirement for proof of identity, and in fact numerous applications

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:14.160
that would benefit from a stricter one-to-one correlation between accounts and people struggle

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.160
with this.

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:18.080
On forums and social media, it's called sockpuppeting.

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:22.740
In crypto, it's called a Sibyl attack, where users are able to generate numerous alternate

01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:25.820
identities by creating additional accounts or wallets.

01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:31.020
The epidemic of wash trading on open sea relies on the ability to pretend you're several

01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:36.580
different people as you buy apes from yourself for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:39.540
Rather than anonymous, this is pseudonymous.

01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:44.220
Everyone can see what wallets and contracts your wallet interacts with based off the long

01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:46.980
hash addresses like this.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:53.120
But that hash is only implicitly connected to your identity based on circumstantial connections.

01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:57.240
Of course, a big circumstantial connection would be something like registering with a

01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:01.120
crypto-based social auction platform that intrinsically connects the two.

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:06.760
This makes it pretty easy to see that Laina Morris, overly attached girlfriend, paid $153

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:12.280
on March 31st to mint the overly attached girlfriend NFT, followed by a $205 reserve

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:15.440
on April 2nd to list the NFT on Foundation.

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:20.380
The Ethereum Whale, far as in far and far, then bought the token on April 3rd for $200

01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:25.780
Ethereum, 30 of which went to Foundation with Laina getting the remaining $170, which she

01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:32.220
transferred into USD using the exchange service Kraken in a block of $105 on April 4th and

01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:41.740
a block of $65 on April 22nd for a combined total payout of $374,726.

01:27:41.740 --> 01:27:47.880
After her sale, Zoe Roth transferred the Ethereum to dollars via Coinbase the next day and hasn't

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:49.620
touched the wallet since.

01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:55.600
Kyle Kraven minted several other tokens, but for the most part just split the Ethereum

01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:01.160
from the initial sale into two separate holding wallets where it's sat untouched since.

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:05.160
You don't need to be some super hacker to figure this stuff out, it's all publicly

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:09.120
available, that's the entire point of the system.

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:14.060
And in another feature not bug arrangement, remember, nothing can be deleted from the

01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:16.340
blockchain without tremendous effort.

01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:22.140
Now that's fine if the blockchain only contains a contextually relevant log of transactions,

01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:26.620
there are absolutely contexts where that level of transparency is desirable.

01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:31.060
But that falls apart when you start talking about using the blockchain itself as the storage

01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:35.300
medium for, like, an entire social network.

01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:40.520
Coinbase social network scuttlebutt seems tacitly aware that this is a bad idea, like

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.600
somewhere inside their human brains they recognize that it might be a mistake to make it impossible

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:49.960
to remove things from the system when they warn users that anyone willing to dig can

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:56.480
surface any old usernames, photos and bios, but that doesn't actually give them pause.

01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:02.120
So if someone posts, say, child abuse imagery, revenge porn, your home address, intimate

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:06.020
details of your private life, there's just nothing you can really do about that.

01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:11.300
If you mistakenly overshare, post some information that maybe you shouldn't have, it's already

01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:12.300
too late.

01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:15.540
You can try to hide it, but you can't delete it.

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:19.420
Remember that if someone knows your wallet address, they can just put tokens directly

01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:20.420
into it.

01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:24.780
As alluded, there's a whole scam where you drop someone at NFT that lifts the art from

01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:29.420
who cares somewhere, but the smart contract is malicious code that drains their wallet

01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:34.160
if they ever interact with it to move it, sell it, stake it, burn it.

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:52.000
It just becomes a landmine sitting in their wallet forever.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.120
Even on the non-malware side of things, people have already been using this to dump promotional

01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:00.800
tokens into the wallets of celebrities and influencers, but, you know, dick pics are

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:03.260
an any second now kind of thing, right?

01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:08.240
Oh look, I minted a photo of your front door and dropped it directly into your wallet.

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:12.120
And you can't just, like, delete it, you need to actively send it somewhere and pay

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:14.700
gas fees to do so.

01:30:14.700 --> 01:30:16.420
Revolutionary new vectors and harassment.

01:30:16.420 --> 01:30:21.120
The end product here is a massive power imbalance that's baked into the fabric of how you engage

01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:23.100
with this new world order.

01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:27.600
Users who engage with the system authentically as themselves expose vast swaths of information

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:32.320
about themselves and their activities, while users who engage disingenuously are empowered

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:35.240
in their ability to deceive, defraud, and disappear.

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:39.000
A lot of this rhetoric stems from a pretty deep failure to understand what a central

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:44.520
authority really is, or that you can decentralize data storage while centralizing data.

01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:49.000
Ethereum is ultimately a central platform, and the fact that a few dozen people need

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.220
to sign off on every major change before it can be implemented is largely meaningless

01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:58.020
and symbolic, with the validation network ultimately sitting somewhere between consortium

01:30:58.020 --> 01:30:59.300
and cartel.

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:04.260
Every large platform has multiple internal and external stakeholders that form a consensus

01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:06.100
about the direction of the platform.

01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:08.820
Windows is not a single-minded monolith.

01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:11.020
Apple issues voting shares.

01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:13.620
Google is basically a hydra.

01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:19.480
While the network of Ethereum miners and validators are not a formal corporation, yet, there's

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:23.960
no mechanism in existence that compels them to act in the interest of users, particularly

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:28.600
poor and disempowered users where those interests conflict with their own.

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:33.360
The movement of Ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake has been vaporware in no

01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:37.920
small part because the validators simply choose not to.

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:42.440
Because proof of work, volatility, and high gas fees benefit them in the here and now,

01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:47.300
proof of stake, and low gas fees only benefit them in a hypothetical future.

01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:51.980
Because these extremely obvious pitfalls are what you get when you let guys like Vitalik

01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:55.220
Buterin and Elon Musk design the future.

01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:59.700
The sole protection for users of Ethereum is that the system is so cumbersome that all

01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:02.700
but the most egregious breaches aren't worth addressing.

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:07.300
Of course, that in truth means that only the wealthy have access to justice within the

01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:08.300
system.

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:12.640
Take all these different things, all these parts of your identity, all your economic

01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:17.360
activity, all the video games you play, all the groups you join, and stick them into one

01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:19.840
system, that's a central system.

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:24.260
It doesn't matter how many different servers that system spans, or how many validators

01:32:24.260 --> 01:32:30.400
need to agree before changes can be made, you've pooled all that data in one place.

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:36.760
The proposed Web3 crypto driven future of the internet is a privacy disaster.

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:39.700
This is why I find MetaMask horrifying as a product.

01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:43.940
It's a bucket that's asking you to pour unfathomable amounts of data and permissions

01:32:43.940 --> 01:32:44.940
into it.

01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:48.460
It's such a tremendous and monumental point of failure.

01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:52.620
And this is where NFTs really bloom into their final form.

01:32:57.460 --> 01:33:03.980
The primary use case of tokens beyond speculation ultimately is to function as access passes.

01:33:03.980 --> 01:33:07.640
From a web engineering perspective, imagine tokens that are the mother of all cookies

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:13.040
and consider a tracking token that users don't just willingly associate themselves with,

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:17.860
but enthusiastically drag with them from device to device ensuring a continuity of

01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:20.720
tracking across all web activity.

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:25.600
The future version of the web, built on the back of cryptocurrency and mediated by financialized

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.600
tokens, is a dystopia.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:31.320
It's a technology that's built to turn everything into money, to treat every corner

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:35.980
of our social existence as a marketplace, to attach an abstract, representative token

01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:39.060
to everything from video games to labor unions.

01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:43.500
Proponents of Web3 will disagree with this assessment, particularly the claim that cryptocurrency

01:33:43.500 --> 01:33:50.740
is endemic to Web3 and the two are intractable, but that's the practical reality of the situation.

01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:54.860
Every substantial project branding itself under the banner of Web3 is strapped to the

01:33:54.860 --> 01:33:59.300
side of a blockchain, be it issuing governance tokens or relying on the chain's smart

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:03.680
contract layer, or requiring possession of a cryptocurrency in order to pay the processing

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:06.280
fees that are mandatory in order to participate.

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:10.600
They are at this point philosophically and technologically entwined.

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:15.680
Less accessible, less free, less interesting, and substantially more expensive, Web3 is

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:21.560
the vanguard of a million paywalls and oppressive, code-enforced DRM schemes sold to idealists

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:25.680
as a decentralized system where they, and not wealthy stakeholders, have the power.

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:29.860
I see tremendous blind spots in a community that has spent so long focusing on the hype

01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:34.660
of an untenable fantasy metaverse where they're the ones cowing corporations with immutable

01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:39.460
ownership guaranteeing their ability to resell video game horse armor that they failed to

01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:45.620
consider that the enforcement of ownership can and will be used against them if and when

01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:48.940
corporations decide to leverage their power in the space.

01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:52.820
The fantasy amongst evangelists is that a tokenized economy where digital goods are

01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:56.160
mediated by NFTs would give them more power.

01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:00.800
Goods like digital games would have true ownership encapsulated in the ability to be resold,

01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:04.640
but there is no reason to believe that this is how things would shake out.

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:09.800
The far, far more probable result is that the tokens are used to lock products down

01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:11.040
even tighter.

01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:13.960
The Squid Game Token scam is illustrative here.

01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:18.720
In early November 2021, a new meme token popped up styled after the hit Netflix show

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:19.940
Squid Game.

01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:23.500
Over the course of about a week, the price of the token was pumped from a few cents

01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:31.100
to just under $3,000 U.S. Estimates are that the Squid developers took in about $3.38 million

01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:35.500
before cashing out their holdings, deleting their socials, and vanishing into thin air.

01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:42.340
A classic rug pull, but the truly transcendental detail is that it left buyers with not merely

01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:46.460
a useless token, but a token that couldn't be sold at all.

01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:51.760
Built into Squid was a requirement that in order to transfer or sell the tokens, a corresponding

01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:56.560
number of marbles tokens needed to be spent at the same time.

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:59.320
The hitch was that marbles were never available.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:04.760
No rules were broken in this scam, and indeed the Squid tokens do exactly what they say

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.760
they do.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:11.200
If you have the appropriate amount of marbles tokens, you can absolutely transfer or sell

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:13.000
your squid.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.400
Just good luck getting any.

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:20.420
A game developer can in any of myriad ways deliver on a truly owned digital token that

01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:25.940
is rendered untradable in practice and all by playing by the rules.

01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:29.660
Rules must always be evaluated for their power to oppress.

01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:33.300
This is a blind spot to crypto enthusiasts because they just assume that they're the

01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:37.020
early adopters, they're the ones who will have power, they're the ones who will get

01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:40.900
to set the rules, and they're the ones who will do the oppressing.

01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:45.320
Remember that any token that can be used to grant access can also be used to revoke

01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:46.320
it.

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:50.380
Like, let's say that I create a hangout spot in one of the metaverse contender platforms

01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:54.480
Decentraland and we call it the Ahigao alpaca oasis.

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:59.120
The oasis has a back room that only allows registered players to enter, meaning you need

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:03.440
to have your meta mask linked to Decentraland in order to get in.

01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:08.800
This type of gate is typically used to create VIP areas, places where only people who hold

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:12.460
a specific token or class of token can enter.

01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:16.740
Only people with official Ahigao alpacas can enter.

01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:21.940
But as is well known within the lore of the metaverse, the Ahigao alpacas have long been

01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:27.380
at war with the board-ape yacht club, so rather than checking for an alpaca token, I check

01:37:27.380 --> 01:37:30.420
for ape tokens and then forbid entrance.

01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:35.580
Or maybe I just make my game artificially more difficult for them, or inflate my prices.

01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:40.280
Now imagine that instead of running a hangout spot in a video game, that I'm a decentralized

01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:44.720
finance organization giving out mortgages in cryptocurrency and I scour your transaction

01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:49.520
history for donations to the NAACP as part of my risk assessment protocol.

01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:53.640
Imagine that Nestle is able to track unionization efforts in real time because the union is

01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:56.920
issuing governance tokens on a publicly auditable blockchain.

01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:02.040
The belief that the world will be fairer if the rules are enshrined in code enforced by

01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:07.900
computers and made extremely difficult to change or circumvent is laughable.

01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:11.460
It's not merely naive, but categorically ahistoric.

01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:13.740
This is where a lot of my resistance comes from.

01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:18.500
You can create specialized crypto chains that have a negligible environmental impact, but

01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:21.980
the force of that model is culturally destructive.

01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:26.240
The current system sucks, but this is just a worse version of the current system.

01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:27.660
It doesn't even stop there.

01:38:27.660 --> 01:38:29.460
It's tokens all the way down.

01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:34.880
This game has a good high barrier of entry, so most people can't do it unless they have

01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:38.280
what's called a scholarship where someone essentially pays for their barrier of entry

01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:42.040
to allow them to play the game and then they can split the profits afterwards.

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:47.520
Like okay, Axie Infinity is a so-called play-to-earn video game based on Ethereum, but because

01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:52.920
Ethereum is too slow and expensive to interact with directly, the developers SkyMavis created

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:58.160
a side chain called Ronin, which consists of a governance currency called AXS.

01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:03.180
The game character tokens called Axies and the in-game currency called Smooth Love Potions

01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:04.540
or SLP.

01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:08.340
All of these components are built to function as money because that's what the machine

01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:09.460
is built to do.

01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:14.380
The so-called play-to-earn model is a great case study in what the end result of the crypto

01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:16.700
econ system actually looks like.

01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:20.620
Axie Infinity gets a lot of credulous coverage from the press because a handful of people

01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:24.900
in the Philippines are able to make a marginal living by playing the game and flipping their

01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:30.160
SLP, which lets SkyMaven turn around and pretend that they're a humanitarian organization

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:34.320
and not a for-profit business who makes money off all the people rushing to buy a team of

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:36.960
Axies believing that they can get paid just for playing.

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:41.800
Now real quick, Axie Infinity is a lightweight card-based PVP game where players fight with

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:44.000
a team of three critters called Axies.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000
It's a bit Pokemon and a bit Slay the Spire.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.920
Axies have randomized attributes and are all tokenized, so if you sell an Axie, you're

01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:53.520
selling that specific Axie.

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:57.380
The loved potions are used to breed Axies and thus form the basis of the economy as

01:39:57.380 --> 01:40:01.180
they are fungible relative to the Axies themselves.

01:40:01.180 --> 01:40:05.020
Matches are either ranked or unranked, but only ranked matches entered using energy which

01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:07.780
recharges every day can earn SLP.

01:40:07.780 --> 01:40:11.700
The amount of energy you have to work with depends on the number of Axies in your wallet

01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:14.060
and ranges from 20 to 60.

01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:17.940
Additionally, higher ranked matches are worth more SLP.

01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:22.660
More SLP means a bigger stable of Axies, which means more energy to play matches, more flexibility

01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:27.560
within the metagame, better team compositions, and baseline better stats enabling easier

01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:28.560
wins.

01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:33.040
So the difference in earning potential between higher and lower ranked accounts is pretty

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:34.560
substantial.

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:38.520
What coverage tends to note and then quickly move on from is the fact that the game is

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:43.480
extremely expensive to onboard, costing hundreds of dollars to assemble a basic team, which

01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:48.240
has led to the rise of what are euphemistically called scholarship programs.

01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:52.580
Players like whale scholars that set up a large number of accounts give players access

01:40:52.580 --> 01:40:58.020
to the game account, but not the underlying wallet, and then pay players a split of the

01:40:58.020 --> 01:41:00.380
SLP the account generates.

01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:05.100
Whale scholars and other mentorship businesses retain full control of the wallet, and thus

01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:08.900
the Axies, the SLP, and any AXS.

01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:11.380
It's capitalism in its rawest form.

01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:16.660
Players invest their time into grinding SLP, and then the owners take half the returns.

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:21.640
Players get to barely make minimum wage, while the owners, who are taking 50% from dozens,

01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:25.560
if not hundreds of players, get to speculate on digital land.

01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:29.640
Look what the whale scholars just got.

01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:34.400
We have land in the Arctic, baby.

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:37.520
We have Arctic land.

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:42.320
Axies energy system is fundamentally broken in how it promotes this exact middleman arrangement.

01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.760
If you have 21 Axies in your wallet, you can create one account that has 60 Energy

01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:52.460
at its disposal, or you can create 7 bare minimum accounts with 20 Energy each.

01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:57.700
A high ranked account with 60 Energy will dramatically outperform a single low ranked

01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:03.580
account with 20 Energy, but 7 accounts that are played daily by other people is far and

01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:09.580
away the best ROI because it involves doing basically nothing except collecting your cut.

01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:14.360
And more illustrative, between August and October 2021, the internal economy of Axie

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:15.840
Infinity crashed.

01:42:15.840 --> 01:42:20.320
Not absolute rock bottom, but bad enough that all but the highest ranking players fell

01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:25.960
below the average daily wage in the Philippines, with low ranked players falling below minimum

01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:26.960
wage.

01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:30.880
Navik, a think tank and consulting firm that does deep research on game economies, has

01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:35.320
done a pretty deep and thorough analysis of the Axie economy, and in their write up they

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:38.600
identify the core sources psychological.

01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:43.100
Players aren't playing to play the game, they're playing to make money, they treat

01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:48.460
the game as a job, and thus have little interest in the game items for their own sake.

01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:53.980
Once they have enough stuff to cover their job, they stop reinvesting and start cashing

01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:54.980
out.

01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:59.060
The price of low quality Axies, the ones that new players are likely to buy in order to

01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:04.900
onboard for the lowest cost possible, is propped up entirely by players buying them roughly

01:43:04.900 --> 01:43:07.180
at the same rate they're generated.

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:11.720
This requires either mentors to be scaling up their teams by buying Axies instead of

01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:17.440
generating them, or new players injecting new money into the ecosystem by onboarding.

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:21.960
But the more players that are playing, the more SLP and Axies that will be generated,

01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:26.600
thus the fundamentally unsustainable economic model where an infinite supply of new players

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:30.920
must enter the ecosystem forever purely to keep the price stable.

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:36.560
If it tips one way or the other, you either get runaway inflation or runaway deflation.

01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:39.060
This happens all the time in games.

01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:42.060
Games bork their internal economy constantly.

01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:46.340
It just doesn't normally matter because you're talking about completely fictional gold or

01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:48.420
gems or dragon bones.

01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:54.340
A truly stable economy isn't even desirable from a gameplay standpoint anyway.

01:43:54.340 --> 01:43:58.980
Gentle inflation ends up helping newer and more casual players by driving down the cost

01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:04.300
of things in the in-game economy which lets those players participate and have fun.

01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:09.880
Of course if your pitch is play to earn and not play to have fun, where the optics of

01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:14.240
buoying up the ficative valuation of your company rest entirely on the assumption that

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:19.060
players can earn, then that's of a bit of a different incentive set, isn't it?

01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:22.920
More people play Axie Infinity to try and make money than play it because it's a game

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:24.040
they enjoy.

01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:26.520
This is a fundamental flaw in the model.

01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:30.680
If you pitch your game based on earning potential, you are going to attract people seeking to

01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:36.780
industrialize your platform faster and in greater numbers than would otherwise play.

01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:42.020
This is exactly the parasitic situation that games for decades now have been actively minimizing

01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:45.140
because it creates vicious negative externalities.

01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:49.060
If players can sell their in-game stuff, then it changes the way they play the game.

01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:53.100
It changes the way they optimize their playtime.

01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:57.780
Since the vast majority of games are openly a non-investment, a straight exchange of money

01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:02.960
for entertainment, also known as a purchase, players tend to optimize their playtime for

01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:09.400
intangible returns like fun, distraction, socialization, relaxation, challenge, achievement, and narrative

01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:13.720
fulfillment with absolutely no expectation that the money and time they put in should

01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:16.760
return anything other than those things.

01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:20.800
The key shift here and the meaningless buzz phrase that you'll encounter online is the

01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:25.640
proposition that the results of playing a game should retain value, which is code for

01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:28.660
having a potentially speculative price.

01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:33.060
In order to try and keep the grift mill running for another few months, Sky Maven have tweaked

01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:36.860
the economy to reduce the amount of SLP players can earn per hour.

01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:42.620
It's a nightmarishly thin edge to be walking on, and the main thing it has managed to accomplish

01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:47.740
is enabling an entire strata of pit bosses running teams of players grinding out smooth

01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:49.380
love potions.

01:45:49.380 --> 01:45:54.020
And like all bosses, they have not taken the downturn in stride and have instead started

01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:55.020
cracking the whip.

01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:58.280
We do not accept mediocre gaming anymore.

01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:04.560
Need at least 120 to 150 SLP a day, and those who yield more will be rewarded with additional

01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:05.880
percentage.

01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:08.680
I prioritize those who have gaming experience.

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:11.160
We have a separate program for charity.

01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:14.480
Evangelists like to point to this as though it's inspiring.

01:46:14.480 --> 01:46:18.640
People in economically disempowered countries able to make a meager living by simply playing

01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:19.640
a video game.

01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:21.320
I reject that framing.

01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:22.320
It's horrifying.

01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:25.780
Our global system is so fundamentally unjust that people are patting themselves on the

01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:30.460
back for generating a whole new kind of online UwU pit boss who tells you to grind harder

01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:33.700
or you're fired but caps it off with a blushy emoji.

01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:34.700
Oopsie.

01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:38.080
Looks like someone didn't meet their quota.

01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:39.080
This sucks.

01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:51.220
I think the thing that normies don't get about NFT bros is their dedication.

01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:56.300
The staggering volume of capital they already control, and how deeply rooted they are in

01:46:56.300 --> 01:47:01.380
the culture of the people who operate the platforms we all use every day, and that alone

01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:03.860
is a good reason for people to pay attention.

01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:09.140
They have a lot of money and a lot of clout that they can use to try and make fetch happen.

01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:11.460
This is something of a splitting point.

01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:14.940
Basically, the future shakes out in one of two broad ways.

01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:19.540
One is that some new technological buzzword comes along and blockchain and web3 lose their

01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:24.500
sway over investors, the stream of new buyers dries up, and the early investors cash out

01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:27.020
as best they can, popping the whole bubble.

01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:31.060
The other is that they're successful, and cryptocurrency is able to crowbar its way

01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:33.940
into enough corners of our lives that it becomes unavoidable.

01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:38.980
We're all forced in some way to maintain a crypto wallet to manage whatever coins and

01:47:38.980 --> 01:47:43.940
tokens become necessary for participation in society, providing early investors with

01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:46.700
a captive audience and steady flow of capital.

01:47:46.700 --> 01:47:51.460
To quote German sociotechnologist Jürgen Guter, better known by his online alias Tante,

01:47:51.460 --> 01:47:56.140
there are parts of your digital life that currently you can't really sell, but that's

01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:58.220
what they want to change.

01:47:58.220 --> 01:48:00.280
Everything needs to be bought and sold.

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:02.700
Everything is just a vehicle for more speculation.

01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:07.380
The reason they want you to be able to resell your access token to some service instead

01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:12.700
of buying or renting it like today is to create even more markets for speculation and the smart

01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:17.020
contracts can be set up in a way that at every corner they profit.

01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:21.140
The claims that this technology facilitates an immutable ledger of ownership is itself

01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:25.460
largely hollow posturing even from within the ecosystem.

01:48:25.460 --> 01:48:30.540
Remember that most of the actual things being referenced are not contained within the chains

01:48:30.540 --> 01:48:35.060
themselves because the chains are too slow, restrictive, and bad at their job to actually

01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:40.580
store media, and because many of the things being sold are purely ephemeral.

01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:45.740
The IPFS address for any given media token can be effortlessly minted onto another competing

01:48:45.740 --> 01:48:48.100
chain or even the same chain.

01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:52.280
That's not even right-click saving, that's referencing the exact same media.

01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:58.100
Why is the token on Ethereum more authoritative than the token on Tezos or Cardano or Solano

01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:04.260
or Ergo or Silo or Binance or Algorand or Polkadot or EOS or Tron or VeChain or Ethereum

01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:09.220
Classic or Phantom or Stellar or Stacks or Neo or Waves or Hollow or Link or Radix or

01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:14.260
Harmony or Oasis or Icon or Secret or Iota or Crown or Terra or Omni or Enigma or Elastos

01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:16.500
or Edgeware or Bitom or Fuse or Gather?

01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:21.500
If a chain hard forks, which version of your stuff is the real one?

01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:27.900
Bitcoin is itself mired in a turf war between Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin SV.

01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:32.740
The myth of immutable ownership governed by these systems is predicated on a monolithic

01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:33.740
victor.

01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:39.220
In reality, your NFTs within the Ethereum ecosystem are ultimately just as trapped,

01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:42.780
sandboxed, and meaningless as your Steam trading cards.

01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:47.260
You'll hear about protocols like Polygon that aim to let you move stuff from chain

01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:49.580
to chain, but that's sleight of hand.

01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:54.140
You can't remove something from a chain, so all they really do is create a new token

01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:59.100
at the destination and add a note to the bottom of the original token that says, I'm currently

01:49:59.100 --> 01:50:01.540
somewhere else, please don't move or sell me.

01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:06.220
It's an ask that's governed by smart contracts so vulnerable to bad coding.

01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:11.100
In video game terms, they would be immediately hammered looking for item duplication glitches,

01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:15.460
a vulnerability that's basically inevitable in a mass adoption scenario.

01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:20.900
It's a system that is at once impenetrable and brittle, and that arrangement disproportionately

01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:22.940
empowers the dishonest.

01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:27.040
One of the complications is that it's basically impossible to extricate the digital scarcity

01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:31.760
concepts of NFTs from cryptocurrency and the core philosophies that cryptocurrency

01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:33.120
was built from.

01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:37.000
One rose out of the other and they are basically forever entwined.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.520
One of the ironies of all this is that any legitimate artistic or anti-capitalist uses

01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:46.540
of the underlying technology are contingent on the tech remaining niche.

01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:51.920
On a very basic level, the systems just suck, being slow, difficult to use, and generally

01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:52.920
oblique.

01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:56.480
For the most part, to the degree that they're usable at all, it is largely at the mercy

01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:58.600
of only having a few users.

01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:03.040
There are blockchains that are reasonably responsive and reasonably cheap because they're not

01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:04.040
popular.

01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:08.760
Hickhead Nunes is a well-regarded art market on the Tezos blockchain, transaction fees

01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:13.200
and deflation are at the moment relatively minimal, and thus a lot of the transactions

01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:16.560
are able to operate in the range of $5 to $20.

01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:22.160
But that state exists by the grace of being 45th in popularity, just high enough to actually

01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:26.240
have users, but not high enough to have attracted too many bots.

01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:30.600
If Tezos goes, as they say, to the moon, then that all changes.

01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:34.320
Users adopt the platform, disproportionate to the scale of validators, the value of

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:38.360
Tez skyrockets, and the actual marketplace of people using Hickhead Nunes experience

01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:43.040
hyper-deflation, where hoarders are rewarded handsomely and buyers are punished.

01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:48.320
Okay, we need to pause here for a moment because this is actually really important, but absurdly

01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:53.040
complex like textbook, length, subject matter, so here's the short version.

01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:56.680
One is counterintuitive because the line is going up, which makes it look like a good

01:51:56.680 --> 01:52:00.240
thing, but it's only good if you already have the currency in hand.

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:04.800
As the purchasing power of a currency increases, typically because cash gets more scarce, the

01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:06.880
cost of goods and labor goes down.

01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:11.160
A deflationary economy punishes buying things as anything that you buy today will inevitably

01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:12.880
be cheaper to buy in the future.

01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:18.040
If you need to buy things that aren't financial assets, things that don't appreciate in value,

01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:22.460
like food, clothing, rent, vehicles, transit fare, you screw yourself over.

01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:27.780
This is hyper-deflation, and it's not only designed into cryptocurrencies with their

01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:33.120
hard cap on total coin supply, but considered desirable by their creators.

01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:37.240
This is what going to the moon means.

01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:39.260
Now let's talk about unions.

01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:43.740
Using tokens to verify union membership and participate in union activities relies on

01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:48.500
the tech being oblique enough that union busters and their clients don't see it as a meaningful

01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:50.280
arena to monitor.

01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:56.260
Although that ship has already sailed, union busters and gig economy evangelists love crypto.

01:52:56.260 --> 01:53:00.440
They love DeFi and they love smart contracts, and they love NFTs.

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:01.640
And why wouldn't they?

01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:05.440
It's an environment that demolishes consumer protections and transfers tremendous amounts

01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:07.620
of explicit power to the wealthy.

01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:11.680
In a lot of ways this is all just a system for deferring trust onto machines and pretending

01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:15.720
that there aren't humans on the other end, and if there's one thing that union busters

01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:21.520
love it's the prospect of an unbreakable individual contract whose inequities can all

01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:23.420
be blamed on a machine.

01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:27.540
The current state of the web, concentrated in a few mega-platforms, is the result of

01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:29.600
compounding complexity.

01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:35.000
We used to have a web where anyone could learn to write a web page in html in an afternoon.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:38.960
It's just writing text and then using tags to format the text.

01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:43.920
But over time, people, understandably, wanted the web to do more, to look better, and so

01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:49.560
the things that were possible expanded via scripting languages that allowed for dynamic,

01:53:49.560 --> 01:53:50.880
interactive content.

01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:56.040
Soon, the definition of what a website was and looked like sailed out of reach of casual

01:53:56.040 --> 01:54:00.960
users and eventually even out of reach of all but the most dedicated hobbyists.

01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:07.720
It became the domain of specialists, so casual users, excluded by complexity, moved to templates,

01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:09.600
services, and platforms.

01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:14.880
This process gradually concentrated a critical mass of users into a handful of social media

01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:15.880
platforms.

01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:19.600
Already, even within the space, new hegemons are forming.

01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:24.000
Tremendous amounts of capital and power are concentrating in corporations like Consensus,

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:29.160
who own MetaMask and Anamoka Brands, who have wide and deep investment in crypto gaming.

01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:34.080
OpenSea, the at-present dominant marketplace for tokens on a couple different chains, is

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:36.840
filling the power roles users need.

01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:40.680
While the chain itself is, in theory, the arbiter of truth, nothing prevents people

01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:46.520
from filling the chain with lies, and so arises a demand for not merely a chain parser, a

01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:52.520
service that enables users to interact with the chain, but an interpreter of the chain.

01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:57.120
Motivational Speaker and DZMark Calvin Bekerra claimed to have lost three board-ape yacht

01:54:57.120 --> 01:55:00.000
club tokens to a social engineering scam.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:04.160
In reaction to this, he took to Twitter to whip up a mob that could pressure OpenSea

01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:08.640
and two other marketplaces into flagging the tokens as stolen, and blocking them from

01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:09.640
being sold.

01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:14.600
Calvin was eventually able to re-secure his tokens by paying a ransom, because that's

01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:18.320
really all you can do, and he doesn't seem to consider that from the perspective of

01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:21.840
the thieves, that's an entirely desirable outcome.

01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:22.840
They won.

01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:24.160
Their plan worked.

01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:26.400
This happens all the time.

01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:30.440
Board-ape members are particularly susceptible targets of fraud, owing to their specific

01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:33.680
combination of greed and low social literacy.

01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:37.680
According to avoid paying platform fees and royalties, many of them moved off OpenSea

01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:42.400
to doing transactions on a shady little platform called NFT Trader, which allowed scammers

01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:47.320
to run a very simple link swap scam and steal at least a dozen different eight tokens in

01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:48.840
the span of a couple days.

01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:52.640
The meat of Calvin's incident is the way in which the platforms that interact with

01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:58.600
the chain are being deputized by users to be the de facto authority, not on what the

01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:03.120
chain says, but what the chain means.

01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:08.000
It is just a re-creation of existing power structures within the new environment.

01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:20.600
Now this is where evangelists insist that the answer lies in dows, decentralized autonomous

01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:26.560
organizations, a revolutionary new way to organize people that will allow for the decentralized

01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:28.520
governance of these systems.

01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:33.520
So that's the claim, but what is it exactly once you strip off the paint?

01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:38.080
A DAO is an organization whose membership, roles, and privileges are governed by possession

01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:43.080
of relevant tokens on a given blockchain, and it's also the underlying software that

01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:45.120
executes relevant operations.

01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:47.400
That's kind of really about it.

01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:52.560
So just to be very clear here, a conceptual DAO consists of three things.

01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:58.480
People, a digital machine built of smart contracts, and a token that allows the people to interact

01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:00.440
with the machine.

01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:06.640
In practice, most things that call themselves DAOs don't have the machine at all, and a

01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:12.200
substantial number either don't have the token, or only have the token.

01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:18.680
The upside of a DAO is that it makes it easy-ish to create a formal organization at theoretically

01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:23.400
any scale, from only a couple people to a massive pool of stakeholders, and the program

01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:27.480
layer makes it possible to automate certain activities and the results.

01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:32.160
If the organization votes via the DAO interface, the results of that vote are automatically

01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:34.960
recorded and potentially executed.

01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:38.040
Though that framing is misleading.

01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:42.600
As with tokens themselves, there's no inherent functionality in a DAO, it's just a box that

01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:43.600
code goes into.

01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:47.840
I might as well be referring to all the things you could do with a web page.

01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:52.840
As already mentioned, many organizations presenting themselves as a DAO have no machine functionality

01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:53.840
at all.

01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:57.680
Every standard to find a DAO that has issued a governance token, the script that's used

01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:02.960
for voting, with the systems to actually use that token being placed somewhere in the

01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:05.360
nebulous future of the roadmap.

01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:09.480
That open-endedness is actually important because while the claim is that these machines will

01:58:09.480 --> 01:58:15.000
further democratize the internet, the technical complexity that they add, the new specialized

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:19.400
programming expertise that they require, concentrates a lot of power in the hands of

01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:24.080
people who can build the templates that in turn enable non-programmers to actually use

01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:25.080
it.

01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:28.680
It's just laying the seeds for the future recreation of the status quo.

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:33.880
The Facebook, Google, Amazon dominated internet arose because the technical cost of building

01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:38.600
a modern website rose far beyond what the vast majority of amateurs could manage.

01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:42.760
So everyone moved to templates and then to services and finally to platforms.

01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:45.800
This doesn't even reset the clock on that.

01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:51.440
The technical cost of creating a DAO is already far beyond any casual amateur, in part because

01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:55.680
all of this is being built by programmers and in part because of the stakes.

01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:59.840
The only thing this stuff is truly good for is managing on-chain assets.

01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:04.800
A DAO program can see the state of the chain and interact with it so the DAO humans can

01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:09.120
vote on what should happen to those assets and then the DAO program can automatically

01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:10.520
act on the results.

01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:15.120
But that raises the stakes, because a DAO can see and interact directly with on-chain

01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:20.840
assets, there's the risk that via bad programming or unforeseen exploits a malicious actor can

01:59:20.840 --> 01:59:23.920
use a DAO to access all kinds of stuff.

01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:29.360
The risk is directly proportional to the value of the assets kept on-chain, and remember

01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:33.560
again that evangelists want to put everything on-chain.

01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:37.240
The hilarious thing is that this has already played out once before.

01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:42.400
In fact it played out with the first DAO ever built, called the DAO.

01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:47.160
This whole story unfolds over the course of three months in 2016, from April to June.

01:59:47.160 --> 01:59:52.520
The DAO was an Ethereum-based venture capital fund that aimed to use code to create an investment

01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:57.400
firm without a conventional management structure or board of directors, a scheme that's positioned

01:59:57.400 --> 02:00:02.320
as lightweight and reducing bureaucratic overhead, but really it just translated to an attempt

02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:06.320
at minimizing human liability for the actions and behaviors of the fund.

02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:10.280
This unparalleled expression of greed made the major speculative players in Ethereum

02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:16.420
so horny that during the April and May pre-sale, they funneled 14% of the entire volume of

02:00:16.420 --> 02:00:19.040
Ether into the DAO's central wallet.

02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:23.360
Now, because the DAO's underlying code was open source, experts and malicious actors

02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:28.640
alike were able to pour over it for vulnerabilities, and indeed, vulnerabilities were found.

02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:33.280
However, because at the end of the day, fleshy humans are the ones actually pushing buttons

02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:38.000
and making decisions, the actual leadership of the nominally leaderless DAO, horny for

02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:41.600
money and prestige, decided to launch in late May anyway.

02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:45.160
Three weeks later, the DAO's programming was exploited and the attacker was able to

02:00:45.160 --> 02:00:51.440
transfer one third of the DAO's funds into a holding wallet, about 5% of the entire Ethereum

02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:55.840
economy valued at the time around $16-17 million.

02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:00.360
Now, because this threatened the bottom line of capital holders, the Ethereum project as

02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:05.480
a whole, the entire thing, was almost immediately forked in order to undo the hack and protect

02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:07.280
the interests of the wealthy.

02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:11.480
In classic, the arm of the fork that didn't undo the attack persists to this day, though

02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:15.500
it's notably less popular despite being demonstrably more principled.

02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:19.000
Because all the talk about decentralization is a myth, it's just words.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:22.560
At the end of the day, the guys in charge, the guys who built the system to serve their

02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:26.240
interests, are still in charge and keep a kill switch in their back pocket.

02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:32.200
Crypto is barely a decade old and organizations deemed too big to fail already exist.

02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:37.120
The whole fiasco laid out the truth from the word go, calling a DAO a revolutionary structure

02:01:37.120 --> 02:01:38.560
is smoke and mirrors.

02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:40.120
It's just voting shares.

02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:44.120
You might as well call Apple a bold experiment in democracy because a baker's judge and

02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:47.000
individuals make the decisions instead of just one.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.920
Regardless of the future pitfalls, DAOs are also extremely limited.

02:01:50.920 --> 02:01:52.800
They are, again, just code.

02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:57.120
Well, evangelists promise that they can reinvent the social organization, mentally consider

02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:01.960
all the problems, conflicts, and decision making that social organizations deal with,

02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:06.840
and ask how many of those even can be solved by code.

02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:11.840
Some of them can easily be turned into computer programs, automated bookkeeping, payouts,

02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:16.280
collections, data tracking, sure, that's all stuff organizations conceptually can make

02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:17.400
use of.

02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:22.120
But how do you code for the fact that red just really doesn't get along with blue?

02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:27.480
The pitch promises organizations bound by unbreakable rules, but how many organizations

02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:30.720
actually benefit from that level of rigidity?

02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:36.080
In particular, what happens when the version of the rules enforced by code run up against

02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:39.160
a complication that the coders didn't consider?

02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:43.080
What happens if someone with legitimate stake in the DAO starts spamming the organization's

02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:45.320
internal systems with bad requests?

02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:47.740
What if not enough people participate in voting?

02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:49.920
What if the system locks itself up?

02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:51.720
What if the rules are rigged?

02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:54.580
What if the system commits a crime?

02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:58.920
If this technology did see mass adoption, a future time bomb already exists in the fact

02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:04.080
that very, very few of these systems have factored mortality into the considerations of their

02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:09.400
future, because what if someone with an important token dies is a really easy thing to overlook

02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:13.960
when you're kind of insulated tech bro who reinvents vending machines and calls them bodega

02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:14.960
boxes.

02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:17.960
Now all of these hypotheticals are technically addressable.

02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:23.200
You can build contingency systems that can account for them, but then you need to consider

02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:28.200
contingencies for those contingencies, because what if someone uses systems intended for

02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:32.760
dealing with deceased or absentee members to expel people they just don't like?

02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:37.640
And again, you can only use code to enforce interactions that the programmers make enforceable

02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:39.280
via the code.

02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:42.920
Constitution DAO, a hastily set up scheme to bid on one of the few remaining original

02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:47.320
copies of the US Constitution, already ran aground most of these problems as the project

02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:52.000
failed to win the auction and is now trying to issue refunds, a thing that the slap-dash

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.680
machine was never intended to do.

02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:59.960
The reality is that most organizations with any meaningful social complexity, even tiny

02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:05.680
organizations like Video Game Guilds, are too complex to properly express in code.

02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:10.200
There's too many contingencies and contingencies for those contingencies and contingencies

02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:12.800
for those contingencies to account for.

02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:18.240
So rather than trying to turn social interactions into code, the DAO is marginalized into only

02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:23.880
handling code-appropriate tasks like bookkeeping, digital signature verification, and on-chain

02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:24.880
asset management.

02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:28.760
But that's not a revolutionary new way to organize people.

02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:30.720
That's just a productivity tool.

02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:35.080
The DAO can have a process for voting on actions, but the moment the outcome of those actions

02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:40.280
move off-chain, i.e. into the real world, the DAO program is powerless.

02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:44.000
The program can't make humans execute the decisions of the group.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.120
That's still an analog problem.

02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:50.480
The whole thing very quickly runs into an incentive wall, where it's just faster and

02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:57.000
easier to solve problems verbally via abstract trust relationships and promises, to the same

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:58.240
end results.

02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:02.760
This is why it's so common for DAOs to not actually have any of the inner machine that

02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:05.760
would actually make them into what they claim to be.

02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:07.560
It's easier to just not.

02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:11.440
Taken as a whole, DAOs aren't some revolutionary new model, they're a tool built onto the

02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:16.320
side of cryptocurrency that only has meaningful advantages when interacting with cryptocurrency

02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:20.440
as a tool for speculative trading and managing financial instruments.

02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:21.800
The rest is just a gimmick.

02:05:21.800 --> 02:05:25.320
A slow, inflexible tool for executing straw polls.

02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:30.480
Again, a lot of these boil down to a scheme to minimize liability on the part of the creators.

02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:35.480
The creators of Inuyasha Token, a meme coin DAO based on nothing except the ephemeral

02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:40.800
concept of the Inuyasha anime, demonstrated this admirably when they were pressed on the

02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:45.920
issue of copyright, openly trading on a known brand specifically for clout.

02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:48.400
Their answer to the question boils down to 1.

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:51.320
A failure to understand copyright and 2.

02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:54.560
An insistence that it doesn't matter because no one's responsible.

02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:55.600
The DAO did it.

02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:58.240
No, humans are liable.

02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:02.040
Just this amorphous, sentient, carbon cloud.

02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:06.800
You have a really good way you explain it about the copyright issue that everyone's

02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:10.000
afraid of because they don't want to invest in a token that's going to be told to cease

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.000
and desist.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Right.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Yeah.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:21.680
So to clear that up, I think first you have to distinguish between a mark and copy.

02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:28.960
So right now, on the website, it's all custom art done by Stephen, your friend Stephen.

02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:29.960
There is no copy.

02:06:29.960 --> 02:06:34.480
I mean, the only person that can really copy us right now is Stephen.

02:06:34.480 --> 02:06:35.480
You know?

02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:38.400
Well, what about logo likeness or character likeness?

02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:39.400
Yeah.

02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:47.720
So, trademarks, it's possible that the Inuyasha mark could become scrutinized.

02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:55.480
However, we're a decentralized autonomous organization officially and the token is

02:06:55.480 --> 02:06:58.000
launched on the Ethereum blockchain.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.560
So there's really no going back.

02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:03.040
I'm just a community member.

02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:04.440
I'm not an owner.

02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:08.920
There's really no single entity that has ownership over this.

02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:11.920
So I mean, it's on the blockchain now.

02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:12.920
There's no going back.

02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:17.760
And that bit also just so brilliantly demonstrates the underlying mentality of a lot of these

02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:18.760
guys.

02:07:18.760 --> 02:07:23.480
They wanted to use the Inuyasha brand for clout, but they didn't want to ask for permission

02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:25.880
because they would probably get rejected.

02:07:25.880 --> 02:07:27.680
So they did it anyway.

02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:31.560
So now that it's on chain, it can't be easily taken down.

02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:35.080
So I guess you just got to let them do it.

02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:36.960
It's on the blockchain now.

02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:38.040
There's no going back.

02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:41.760
Things get funny in that frustrating way when you do come across a doubt that's trying

02:07:41.800 --> 02:07:45.600
to be legitimate and they tip their hand by revealing that underneath they're legally

02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:49.680
a co-op or an LLC or some other extant legal entity.

02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:54.800
Unless your goal is a grift, there's nothing truly revolutionary about their structure or

02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:55.800
functionality.

02:07:55.800 --> 02:08:00.240
Lee Jin, the co-founder of a bunch of predatory venture capital firms that focus on polishing

02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:05.120
the image of the gig economy to distract from the ways in which it's eroding labor, has

02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:09.640
an extended Twitter thread where she tries to pitch dows as the future of unions, though

02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:15.080
her rationale is not only shaky, relying heavily on magical thinking, it's also peppered with

02:08:15.080 --> 02:08:17.000
inexplicable lies.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:21.800
For example, she champions yield guild, a doubt that she describes as a gaming guild

02:08:21.800 --> 02:08:26.560
comprised of thousands of play to earn gamers, an on-ramp that brings more players into play

02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:31.320
to earn gaming, it can represent gamers and lobby game devs for better policies.

02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:36.200
Its scale also enables the collective to offer benefits and protections, e.g. health care,

02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:41.160
paid time off that would be infeasible if gamers were operating on their own.

02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:44.720
This is a tremendous overstatement of what yield actually is.

02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:49.200
It's not a union, nor does it function as a union, nor does it have aspirations of functioning

02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:50.320
as a union.

02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:54.640
It's not even a doubt, though it does have aspirations of transitioning into being one.

02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:58.800
It's at best a mildly decentralized cartel that's experimenting with shaking down players

02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:03.000
with the promise of helping them by gamifying the process of participating in the guild.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:07.040
In practice, it's a discord server that helps play to earn players, find sponsorships,

02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:11.000
pivot from one game to another, and generally pitch about how much their jobs suck.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:15.320
In fact, in response to Legion's tweets, the server residents had this to say.

02:09:15.320 --> 02:09:19.800
I've read that through the YGG, DAO members are able to get access to health care.

02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:20.800
Is this true?

02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:21.800
Is there any more info on this?

02:09:21.800 --> 02:09:23.440
Anywhere to learn more about what is offered?

02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:25.160
Or is this still in the works?

02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:28.560
As a freelancer, I'm always interested to learn about more options.

02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:32.520
I actually don't know about that, that would be awesome to get partnered with health care.

02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:33.680
How did you get that info, though?

02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:35.840
We haven't heard of any kind about it.

02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:40.960
Hmm, yeah, I think Lee used it as an example of potential benefits and didn't mean it

02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:45.120
literally, but nothing of that sort has been discussed yet.

02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:49.720
Now on a functional level, most DAOs use an administrative system based off the use and

02:09:49.720 --> 02:09:52.960
spending of internal script, the governance tokens.

02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:56.360
There's a decent amount of variability in how they're used, but basically they function

02:09:56.360 --> 02:10:01.000
either as proportional voting power, exactly the same as voting shares in a publicly traded

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.160
company, fiat voting power where there's no point in possessing more than one, or direct

02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:11.280
voting power where tokens are spent to cast votes and more tokens can be spent to cast

02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:12.680
more votes.

02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:16.760
Typically this script can be bought and sold, even on a secondary market, and indeed possession

02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:20.120
of it is typically a definitional part of membership.

02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:23.720
Rather than structuring like a union, Yield's overt goal for their DAO is to function as

02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:28.080
a hedge fund, using the exchange value of their token as a means to raise funds to invest

02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:32.040
into play to earn games and allowing yield members to spend their tokens to rent these

02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:33.880
DAO-owned resources.

02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:38.000
In fact, Yield is so far removed from the purpose and functionality of a union that the roadmap

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:42.440
includes potentially implementing what's called holographic consensus, which is a futures

02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:47.400
market where participants gamble on what proposals will or won't be passed using their governance

02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:49.160
tokens as the stakes.

02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:53.920
It's amazing if you wanted to build a machine whose sole purpose is to concentrate political

02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:55.960
power slowly over time.

02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:00.640
Additionally, many use a proof of stake staking system to reward members with additional tokens

02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:04.120
with no gate on how many tokens any single member can hold.

02:11:04.120 --> 02:11:09.320
This whole arrangement creates a system where participants with only a few tokens are incentivized

02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:15.160
to not vote against the interests of highly staked members, plus anything you spend limits

02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:20.200
what you can stake, and thus reduces all future income of tokens, which means even less voting

02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:21.840
power in the future.

02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:26.120
Members who possess a disproportionate share of tokens can afford to outspend on the outcome

02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:30.440
of any vote and still retain a proportional future voting power.

02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:35.400
At best, you end up with high-powered voting blocks, and at worst, a functional monopoly.

02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:40.120
The internal discourse of Yield is, like all crypto, focused on the price of the DAO script

02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:44.000
and not its actual functionality within the organization.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.160
Rather than creating a more equitable, democratic organization that looks out for the needs

02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:52.320
of all its members, Yield is a scheme that explicitly rewards its highest stakeholders

02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:54.480
with more power and access.

02:11:54.480 --> 02:11:59.440
Now, conceptually, you could make a DAO that behaves towards actually useful worker-focused

02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:04.320
goals, but you could also do that without a DAO, because it's just an organization.

02:12:04.320 --> 02:12:08.840
The DAO itself is just a mechanism of an organization, and more often than not, its involvement is

02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:10.760
little more than tech fetishism.

02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:14.680
So most actual DAOs don't resemble anything like a flat hierarchy.

02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:19.040
In fact, the ability to buy and sell voting power and the hierarchy that results is seen

02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:24.440
as a strict advantage in that it allows emotionally uninvested members to make money and gives

02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:28.520
them a thing that they can reward people with that will align incentives.

02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:32.680
And despite the fact that Li Jin is directly involved with Yield as the philosopher in

02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:36.880
residence, Yield is neither structured like a labor union, nor does it have ambitions

02:12:36.880 --> 02:12:37.960
to be one.

02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:42.200
The point is that thought leaders like Li Jin, who get a lot of social traction by promising

02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:47.280
that their techno-fetishistic community are solving big societal problems, are liars.

02:12:47.280 --> 02:12:51.360
They love the patentry of democracy because it allows them to pretend to be democratic,

02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:54.720
because they can paint their detractors as being undemocratic.

02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:58.760
It's all hollow hand-waving and techno babble to distract from the fact that it's just

02:12:58.760 --> 02:12:59.760
shareholding.

02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:04.360
It's the corporatization of everything, the conversion of the entire world into claves

02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:09.160
governed by power granted via token possession and enforced by machines that allow humans

02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:11.240
to wash their hands of the outcomes.

02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:15.160
At the end of the day, every DAO pretending to be useful is still a forced entry point

02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:20.440
to some hype-driven meme coin whose existence only benefits its creators and the exchange

02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:37.640
that sells it.

02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:40.400
In 2008, the economy functionally collapsed.

02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:42.920
The basic chain reaction was this.

02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:46.300
Bankers took mortgages and turned them into something they could gamble on.

02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:48.960
This created a bubble, and then the bubble popped.

02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:53.280
When you drill down into it, you realize that the core of the crypto ecosystem, the core

02:13:53.280 --> 02:14:00.560
of Web3, the core of the NFT marketplace, is a turf war between the wealthy and ultra-wealthy.

02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:05.200
Technofetishists who look at people like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, billionaires minted via

02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:09.800
tech industry doors that have now been shut by market calcification and are looking for

02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:15.040
a do-over, looking to synthesize a new market where they can be the one to ascend from a

02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:19.280
merely wealthy programmer to a hyper-wealthy industrialist.

02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:22.480
It's a catfight between the 5% and the 1%.

02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:27.600
Ultimately, the driving forces underlying this entire movement are economic disparity.

02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:31.600
The wealthy and tenuously wealthy are looking for a space that they can dominate, where

02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:35.920
they can be trendsetters and taste makers and can seemingly invent value through sheer

02:14:35.920 --> 02:14:37.280
force of will.

02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:40.960
This is, in my opinion, the blind spot of many casual critics.

02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:47.360
The fact that tokens representing APP-FPs are useless yet somehow still expensive isn't

02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:50.920
an overlooked glitch in the system, it's half the point.

02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:53.440
It's a digital extension of inconvenient fashion.

02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:55.960
It's a flex and a form of myth-making.

02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:57.880
And that's how it draws in the bottom.

02:14:57.880 --> 02:15:02.440
People who feel their opportunities shrinking, who see the system closing around them, who

02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:07.920
have become isolated by social media and a global pandemic, who feel the future getting

02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:09.160
smaller.

02:15:09.160 --> 02:15:14.080
People pressured by the casualization of work as jobs are dissolved into the gig economy

02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:17.320
and want to believe that escape is just that easy.

02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:21.720
All you gotta do is bet on the right discord and you might be airdropped at the next new

02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:22.720
hotness.

02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:26.880
It could be you plucked out of the crowd on Rarible and bestowed a six-figure price by

02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:31.800
an elusive Emirati music producer, get a bake in your wallet, hodl like a good diamond

02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:34.040
hands and enjoy that yield.

02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:39.520
All you need is $5,000 in seed money and you can buy a Farmers World milk cow and if you

02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:43.640
milk that cow every four hours, day and night for two weeks, why there's all your money

02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:48.880
back right there and now it's pure profit minus naturally the overhead of all the wax

02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:52.240
you needed to stake, the barn you needed to buy and build, the barley you needed to purchase

02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:55.560
and grow, the food you needed to buy to refill, the energy you needed to milk the cow, build

02:15:55.560 --> 02:15:58.880
the barn and grow the barley plus you actually need to cash out which isn't getting paid,

02:15:58.880 --> 02:15:59.880
it's quitting.

02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:04.160
It's your chance to stick it to Wall Street and venture capitalists as long as you pay

02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:07.000
no attention to the VCs behind the curtain.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:09.840
The line can only go up.

02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:15.640
It's a movement driven in no small part by rage, by people who looked at 2008, who looked

02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:20.600
at the system as it exists but concluded that the problems with capitalism were that it

02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:24.240
didn't provide enough opportunities to be the boot.

02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:25.440
And that's the pitch.

02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:30.640
Buy in now, buy in early and you could be the high tech future boot.

02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:36.680
Our systems are breaking or broken, straining under neglect and sabotage and our leaders

02:16:36.680 --> 02:16:41.240
seem at best complacent, willing to coast out the collapse.

02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:48.000
We need something better but a system that turns everyone into petty digital landlords

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:54.400
that distills all interaction into transaction that determines the value of something by

02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:59.640
how sellable it is and whether or not it can be gambled on as a fractional token sold

02:16:59.640 --> 02:17:02.800
by a micro auction, that's not it.

02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:06.200
A different system does not inherently mean a better system.

02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:08.960
We replace bad systems with worse ones all the time.

02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:13.800
We replaced a bad system of working bosses with a terrible system of apps, gigs and

02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:15.400
on demand labor.

02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:20.720
So it's not just that I oppose NFTs because the foremost of them are aesthetically vacuous

02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:25.080
representations of the dead inner lives of the tech and finance bros behind them, it's

02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:28.000
that they represent the vanguard of a worse system.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:32.440
The whole thing, from open sea fantasies for starving artists to the buy in for pay to

02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:37.000
earn games, it's the same hollow exploitative pitch as MLMs.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:41.880
It's amway, but everywhere you look people are wearing ugly ass ape cartoons.

02:17:50.720 --> 02:18:00.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

02:18:00.720 --> 02:18:10.720
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:19.720
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:29.720
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:39.720
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

02:18:39.720 --> 02:18:46.720
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
