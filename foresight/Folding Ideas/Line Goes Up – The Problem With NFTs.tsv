0	5680	For online content creators, the unavoidable subject of 2021 has been NFTs, from incredibly
5680	10800	cringe-worthy ape profile pics to incomprehensibly tasteless tributes to deceased celebrities
10800	15960	to six-figure sales of the original copy of a meme, it is the thing that is currently
15960	21000	dominating the collective brain space of digital artists and sucking up all the oxygen in the room.
21000	22360	And I do want to talk about that.
22360	27600	I want to talk about my opinions on NFTs and digital ownership and scarcity and all the
27600	32480	myriad dimensions of the issue, but I don't just want to talk about NFTs.
32480	39520	I can't just talk about NFTs because ultimately they are just a symbol of so much more and
39520	43000	it is that more that is ultimately important.
43000	72320	So let me tell you a story.
72320	75160	In 2008 the economy functionally collapsed.
75160	77920	The basic chain reaction was this.
77920	81880	Banks came up with a thing called a mortgage-backed security, a financial instrument that could
81880	87240	be traded or collected that was based on a bundle of thousands of individual mortgages.
87240	91680	Based on the general reluctance of banks to issue mortgages, the risk aversion in lending
91680	96480	someone hundreds of thousands of dollars that they'll pay off over the course of potentially
96480	100200	decades, these bonds were seen as especially stable.
100200	105800	However, they were also immensely profitable for the banks who both issue the mortgages
105800	107840	and the bonds.
107840	111920	Because of that perceived stability, a lot of other financial organizations like pension
111920	116500	funds and hedge funds use them as the backbone of their investment portfolio.
116500	121080	In this arrangement, a mortgage becomes more profitable to the bank issuing the mortgage
121080	125480	as a component of a bond than it is as a mortgage.
125480	129600	Proportionally the returns per mortgage from the bond are just that much better than the
129600	131880	returns from the isolated mortgage.
131880	134040	There are some problems though.
134040	137920	Problem one is that the biggest returns on a bond come from when it first hits the market.
137920	143360	A new bond that creates new security sales is worth more than an old bond that is slowly
143360	146680	appreciating but not seeing much trade.
146680	151160	Problem two is that there are a finite number of people and houses in America.
151160	156320	The market has to level out at a natural ceiling as eventually all or nearly all mortgages
156320	161160	are packaged into bonds, thus very few new bonds can be generated and sold.
161160	163200	So here's the incentives that are created.
163200	168040	One, it's good for banks if there are more houses that they can issue mortgages for.
168040	173960	Two, the more mortgages issued the better because a bad mortgage is worth more as a component
173960	178200	of a bond than a good mortgage that's not part of a bond.
178200	182880	So real estate developers find that they have a really easy time getting funding from banks
182880	187200	for creating vast new suburbs full of houses that can be sold to generate mortgages, but
187200	192040	rather than building the kind of housing that most people actually need and want, they focus
192040	196840	specifically on the kinds of upper middle class houses that fit into the sweet spot
196840	199800	from the perspective of the banks packaging the bonds.
199800	204720	Buyers in turn find that they have a suspiciously easy time getting a mortgage, despite the
204720	209080	fact that for most people the economy wasn't doing so great.
209160	213960	Wages were stagnant and yet even though developers were going absolutely haywire building new
213960	218280	housing, the houses being built were all out of their price range to begin with and counter
218280	224960	intuitively this massive increase in supply wasn't driving down the price.
224960	229320	This is because the houses were being bought just mostly not by people intending to live
229320	234080	in them, they were being bought by speculators who would then maybe rent them out or often
234080	238360	just leave them vacant with the intent to sell a couple years later.
238360	242240	Because speculators were buying up the supply, it created synthetic demand.
242240	247080	The price keeps going up because speculators keep buying which creates the illusion that
247080	252320	the value is going up which attracts more speculators who buy up more supply and further
252320	253860	inflate the price.
253860	258320	These speculators are enabled by a system that is prioritizing generating new mortgages
258320	262440	purely for the sake of having more mortgages to package into bonds.
262440	266840	The down payments are low and the mortgages all have a really attractive teaser rate meaning
266840	271840	that for the first 3-7 years of the mortgage the monthly payments are rock bottom, as low
271840	276840	as a few hundred dollars per month against a mortgage that would normally charge thousands.
276840	281400	Caught up in all this are legitimate buyers who have been lured into signing for a mortgage
281400	286280	that they can't afford by aggressive sales people who have an incentive to generate mortgages
286280	290280	that they can then sell to a bank who can put it into a bond to sell to pension funds
290280	293800	to make a line go up because it's good when the line goes up.
293800	295120	It's a bubble.
295120	298840	The bubble burst as the teaser rates on the mortgages started to expire.
298840	303960	The monthly cost jumped up and since the demand was synthetic there were no actual buyers
303960	306440	for the speculators to sell the houses to.
306440	311120	So the speculators start dumping stock which finally drives prices down, but because the
311120	317600	original price was so inflated the new price is still out of reach of most actual buyers.
317600	321400	Legitimate buyers caught in the middle find their rates jumping too, but because the price
321400	325600	of the house is going down as speculators try and dump their stock the price of the
325600	331360	house goes down relative to the mortgage issued and thus they can't refinance and are locked
331360	333640	into paying the original terms.
333640	337720	Unable to sell the house and unable to afford the monthly payments the owners, legitimate
337720	340600	and speculators default on their mortgages.
340600	341960	They stop paying.
341960	346800	Eventually the default rate reaches criticality and the bonds fail.
346800	352640	As the bonds fail this impacts all the first order buyers of the bonds, hedge funds, pension
352640	355020	funds, retirement savings funds and the like.
355020	360880	It also cascades through all derivatives which are financial products that take their value
360880	363440	directly from the value of the bond.
363440	365600	This creates a knock on effect.
365600	371280	Huge segments of the economy turn out to be dead trees rotten to the core, but as a rotten
371280	376600	tree falls it still shreds its neighbors and crushes anything below it.
376600	381360	It was a failure precipitated by a combination of greed, active fraud and willful blindness
381360	383040	at all levels of power.
383040	387200	The banks issuing the bad mortgages were the same banks selling the bonds and providing
387200	390200	the capital to build the houses to generate the mortgages.
390200	394720	The ratings agencies checking the bonds were themselves publicly traded and dependent on
394720	399520	being in good relations with the banks incentivized to rubber stamp whatever rating would make
399520	401020	their client happy.
401020	405720	The regulatory agencies that should have seen the problem coming were gutted by budget cuts
405720	410080	admired in conflicts of interest as employees use their positions in regulation to secure
410080	412040	higher paying jobs in industry.
412040	416880	And, the cherry on top, the people largely responsible for it all knew that because they
416880	421600	and their toxic products were so interwoven into the foundations of the economy they could
421600	426960	count on a bailout from the government because no matter how rotten they were, they were
426960	428960	very large trees.
435720	444520	This naked display of greed and fraud created what would be fertile soil for both anti-capitalist
444520	449160	movements and hyper-capitalist movements, both groups of people who saw themselves as being
449160	454960	screwed over by the system, with one group diagnosing the problem as the systems inherently
454960	460200	corrupt and corrupting incentives, and the other seeing the crisis as a consequence of
460200	463720	too much regulation, too much exclusion.
463720	468640	The hyper-capitalist or anarcho-capitalist argument is that in a less constrained market
468640	474040	there would be more incentive to call foul, that regulation had only succeeded in creating
474040	478560	an in-group that was effectively able to conspire without competition.
478560	482160	Of course this argument fails to consider that a substantial number of people within
482160	487240	the system did in fact get fabulously wealthy specifically by betting against the synthetic
487240	490160	excess of the market, but regardless.
490160	496800	Into this environment in 2009 arrived Bitcoin, an all-electronic peer-to-peer currency.
496800	501680	Philosophically Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general was paraded as an end to banks
501680	503840	and centralized currency.
503840	508000	This is what will form the bedrock, both philosophical and technological, that NFTs
508000	509800	will be built on top of.
509800	515400	It's a bit of a hike from here to the board APIOT club, so I guess get ready for that.
515400	516400	Strap in.
516400	519400	As we get into this we're going to have to deal with a lot of vocabulary.
519640	525360	Some of this is the result of systems that are very technically intricate, and some of
525360	529840	this is from systems that are poorly designed, or deliberately obtuse in order to make them
529840	533280	difficult to understand, and thus appear more legitimate.
533280	537320	The entire subject sits at the intersection of two fields that are notoriously prone to
537320	542900	hyped based obfuscation, computer tech and finance, and inheritance a lot of bad habits
542900	547680	from both, with a reputation for making things deliberately more difficult to understand,
547680	553160	specifically to create the illusion that only they are smart enough to understand it.
553160	557880	Mining and minting are both methods of making tokens, which are the base thing that blockchains
557880	563200	deal with, but the two are colloquially different processes, where mining is a coin token created
563200	568000	as a result of the consensus protocol, and minting is user-initiated, addition of a token
568000	569360	to a blockchain.
569360	572960	All blockchains are made of nodes, and these nodes can be watcher nodes, miner nodes or
572960	577680	validator nodes, though most miner nodes are also validator nodes.
577680	581360	Fractionalization is the process of taking one asset and creating a new asset that represents
581360	583200	portions of the original.
583200	589040	So you get DOG, a meme coin crypto D5 venture capital fund backed by the fractionalization
589040	593840	of the original Doge meme sold as an NFT to PleaserDAO on the Ethereum network.
593840	598200	I'm sorry, some of this is just gonna be like that.
598200	602800	The idea behind cryptocurrency is that your digital wallet functions the same as a bank
602800	603640	account.
603640	607640	There's no need for a bank to hold and process your transactions, because rather than holding
607640	612320	a sum that conceptually represents physical currency, the crypto coins in your crypto
612320	615080	wallet are the actual money.
615080	618760	And because this money isn't issued by a government, it is resistant to historical
618760	623920	cash crises like hyperinflation caused by governments devaluing their currency on purpose
623920	625240	or by accident.
625240	629840	It brings the flexibility and anonymity of cash and barter to the digital realm, allowing
629840	633920	individuals to transact without oversight or intermediaries.
633920	639800	And in a one paragraph pitch you can see the appeal, there's a compelling narrative there.
639800	644400	But of course in the 12 years since then, none of that played out as designed.
644400	649160	Bitcoin was structurally too slow and expensive to handle regular commerce, the whole thing
649160	654040	basically came out the gate as a speculative financial vehicle, and so the only consumer
654040	659080	market that proved to be a viable use was buying and selling prohibited drugs where
659120	664760	the high fees, rapid price fluctuations, and multi-hour transaction times were mitigated
664760	668640	by receiving LSD in the mail a week later.
668640	672920	And as far as banking is concerned, Bitcoin was never designed to solve the actual problems
672920	678000	created by the banking industry, only to be the new medium by which they operated.
678000	682000	The principal offering wasn't revolution, but at best a changing of the guard.
682000	686240	The gripe is not with the outcomes of 2008, but the fact that you had to be well connected
686360	689960	in order to get in on the grift in 2006.
689960	692560	And even the change of the guard is an illusion.
692560	696400	Old money finance assholes like the Winklevoss twins were some of the first big names to
696400	700000	jump onto crypto where they remain to this day.
700000	703720	Financial criminal Jordan Belfort, convicted of fraud for running pump and dump schemes
703720	708960	and barred for life from trading regulated securities or acting as a broker, loves crypto.
708960	713120	Venture capitalist Chris Dixon, who has made huge bank off the old web in his role as a
713120	718560	general partner at VC firm Anderson Horowitz, is super popular in the NFT space.
718560	724000	He likes to paint himself as an outsider underdog, fighting the gatekeepers, but he also sits
724000	728800	on the boards of Coinbase, a large cryptocurrency exchange that makes money by being the gatekeeper
728800	733760	collecting a fee on all entries and exits to the crypto economy, and Oculus VR, which
733760	735960	is owned by Meta and a Facebook.
735960	741000	Peter Thiel, who also went from wealthy to ultra-wealthy off the web to boom via PayPal,
741000	745360	loves crypto, and his friends with a bunch of eugenics advocates who promote cryptocurrency
745360	747960	as a return to sound money.
747960	752560	For a whole bunch of extremely racist reasons, because when they start talking about banks
752560	755280	and bankers, they mean Jews.
755280	759880	Some of the largest institutional holders of cryptocurrency are the exact same investment
759880	763400	banks that created the subprime loan crash.
763400	767520	Rather than being a reprieve to the people harmed by the housing bubble, the people whose
767560	774040	savings and retirements were unknown to them being gambled on smoke, cryptocurrency instantly
774040	777200	became the new playground for smoke vendors.
777200	780400	This is a really important point to stress.
780400	785760	Cryptocurrency does nothing to address 99% of the problems with the banking industry,
785760	791360	because those problems are patterns of human behavior, their incentives, their social structures,
791360	792360	their modalities.
792360	797480	The problem is what people are doing to others, not that the building they're doing it in
797480	800560	has the word bank on the outside.
800560	806040	In addition to not fixing problems, bitcoin also came with a pretty substantial drawback.
806040	810380	The innovation of bitcoin over previous attempts at digital currency was to employ a distributed
810380	815440	append-only ledger, a kind of database where new entries can only be added to the end,
815440	820200	and then to have several different nodes called validators compete over who gets to validate
820200	821680	the next update.
821680	826680	These are, respectively, the blockchain and proof-of-work verification.
826760	831080	Now, proof-of-work has an interesting history as a technology, typically being deployed
831080	833440	as a deterrent to misbehavior.
833440	838280	For example, if you require that every email sent, the user's computer has to compute
838280	840040	a small math program.
840040	845200	It places a trivial load onto normal users sending a few dozen, or even a couple hundred
845200	849880	emails a day, but places a massive load on the infrastructure of anyone attempting to
849880	852400	spam millions of emails.
852400	856640	How it works in bitcoin, simply put, is that when a block of transactions are ready to
856640	861240	be recorded to the ledger, all of the mining nodes in the network compete with one another
861240	866680	to solve a cryptographic math problem that's based on the data inside the block.
866680	871840	Effectively, they're competing to figure out the equation that yields a specific result
871840	876520	when the contents of the block are fed into it, with the complexity of the desired result
876520	881120	getting deliberately more difficult based on the total processing power available to
881120	882360	the network.
882360	886120	Once the math problem has been solved, the rest of the validation network can easily
886120	890160	double-check the work, since the contents of the block can be fed into the proposed
890160	894360	solution and it either spits out the valid answer, or fails.
894360	898480	If the equation works and the consensus of validator signs off on it, the block is added
898480	902360	to the bottom of the ledger, and the miner who solved the problem first is rewarded with
902360	904280	newly generated bitcoin.
904280	908640	The complexity of the answer that the computers are trying to solve scales up based on the
908640	914040	network's processing power, specifically to incur heavy diminishing returns as a protection
914040	919920	against an attack on the network where someone just builds a bigger computer and takes over.
919920	923120	Critics pointed out that this created new problems.
923120	927160	Adversarial validation would deliberately incur escalating processing costs, which would
927160	931600	in turn generate perverse structural incentives that would quickly reward capital holders
931600	936120	and lock out any individual that wasn't already obscenely wealthy, because while the escalating
936120	941480	proof of work scheme incurs heavy diminishing returns, diminishing returns are still returns,
941480	946160	so more would always go to those with the resources to build the bigger rig.
946160	951080	No matter what bitcoin future was envisioned, in the here and now, computer hardware can
951080	953040	be bought with dollars.
953040	957880	Rather than dismantling corrupt power structures, this would just become a new tool for existing
957880	958880	wealth.
958880	962200	And that's...exactly what happened.
962200	966920	Just began an arms race for bigger and bigger processing rigs, followed by escalating demands
966920	971800	for the support systems, hardware engineers, HVAC, and operating space needed to put those
971800	973160	rigs in.
973160	976840	And don't worry, we're not forgetting the power requirements.
976840	981360	These rigs draw an industrial amount of power, and because of the winner takes all nature
981360	986600	of the competition, huge amounts of redundant work are being done and discarded.
986600	989120	Estimates for this power consumption are hard to verify.
989120	994040	The data is very complex, spread across hundreds of operators around the globe, who move frequently
994040	999280	in search of cheap electricity, and it's all pretty heavily politicized.
999280	1003880	But even conservative estimates from within the crypto mining industry puts the some energy
1003880	1009120	cost of bitcoin processing on par with the power consumption of a small industrialized
1009120	1010120	nation.
1010120	1015080	Now, evangelists will counter that the global banking industry also uses a lot of power,
1015080	1021200	gesturing at things like idle ATMs humming away all night long, which is, strictly speaking,
1021200	1022360	not untrue.
1022360	1028560	On a factual level, the entire global banking industry does, in fact, use a lot of total
1028560	1029960	electricity.
1029960	1034480	But for scale, it takes six hours of that sustained power draw for the bitcoin network
1034480	1038960	to process as many transactions as Visa handles in one minute.
1038960	1045680	And during that time, Visa is using fractions of a cent of electricity per transaction.
1045680	1049920	And that's just Visa, that's one major institution.
1049920	1056840	So yes, globally, the entirety of the banking industry consumes a lot of power, and a non-trivial
1056840	1060160	portion of that is waste that could be better allocated.
1060160	1065120	But it's also the global banking industry for 7 billion people, and not the hobby horse
1065120	1067760	of a few hundred thousand gambling addicts.
1067760	1072740	So just to head all this off at the pass, bitcoin and proof-of-work cryptocurrency aren't
1072740	1078260	incentivizing a move to green energy sources like solar and wind, they are offsetting it.
1078260	1083320	Because electrical consumption, electrical waste, is the value that underpins bitcoin.
1083320	1088320	Miners spend X dollars in electricity to mine a bitcoin, they expect to be able to sell
1088320	1091320	that coin for at least X plus profit.
1091320	1095160	When new power sources come online and the price of electricity goes down, they don't
1095160	1108080	let X go down, they build a bigger machine.
1108080	1113120	In 2012, Vitalik Buterin, a crypto enthusiast and butthurt warlock main, set out to fix
1113120	1116840	what he saw as the failings and inflexibilities of bitcoin.
1116840	1122040	Rather than becoming the new digital currency, a thing that people actually used to buy stuff,
1122040	1126760	bitcoin had become an unwieldy speculative financial instrument, too slow and expensive
1126760	1131000	to use for anything other than stunt purchases of expensive cars.
1131000	1135360	It was infested with money laundering and mired in bad press.
1135360	1139840	After the FBI shut down Silk Road, you couldn't even buy drugs with it anymore.
1139840	1144440	In practice, you couldn't do anything with your bitcoin, but bet on it, lock up money
1144440	1148840	you already have in the hopes that bitcoin goes up later and pray you don't lose it
1148840	1153760	all in a scam, lose access to your wallet, or have it all stolen by an exchange.
1153760	1158720	The result launched in 2014 was Ethereum, a competing cryptocurrency that boasted lower
1158720	1163600	fees, faster transaction times, a reduced electrical footprint, and most notably, a
1163600	1166280	sophisticated processing functionality.
1166280	1170520	While the bitcoin blockchain only tracks the location and movement of bitcoins, Ethereum
1170520	1171920	would be broader.
1171920	1176360	In addition to tracking ethercoins, the ledger would also be able to track arbitrary blocks
1176360	1177360	of data.
1177360	1181600	As long as they were compatible with the structure of the Ethereum network, these blocks of data
1181600	1186920	could even be programs that would utilize the validation network as a distributed virtual
1186920	1187920	machine.
1187920	1192120	Vitalik envisioned this as a vast infinite machine, duplicated and distributed across
1192120	1197600	thousands or millions of computers, a system onto which the entire history of a new internet
1197600	1203400	could be immutably written, immune to censorship and impossible for governments to take down.
1203400	1208240	He saw it dismantling banks and other intermediary industries, allowing everyone to be their own
1208240	1213680	bank, to be their own stockbroker, to bypass governments, regulators, and insurance agencies.
1213680	1218440	His peers envisioned a future where Ethereum became not just a repository of financial
1218440	1220880	transactions, but of identity.
1220880	1225000	With these, drivers licenses, professional credentials, medical records, educational
1225000	1229480	achievements, and employment history turned into tokens and stored immutable and eternal
1229480	1231200	on the chain.
1231200	1235080	Through crypto and the Ethereum virtual machine, they could bring all the benefits of Wall
1235080	1239880	Street investors and Silicon Valley venture capitalists to the poorest people of the world,
1239880	1242060	the unbanked and forgotten.
1242060	1247000	This heady, high-minded philosophy is outlined in great detail in the journalistic abortion,
1247000	1251460	The Infinite Machine, by failed journalist turned crypto shill Camila Rousseau.
1251460	1253800	The book is actually really interesting.
1253800	1258120	Not for the merits of the writing, Rousseau fails to interrogate the validity or rationality
1258120	1263040	of even the simplest claims, and falls just shy of hagiography by occasionally noting
1263040	1267680	that something was a bit tacky or embarrassing, but only just shy.
1267680	1271640	She tells florid stories about the impoverished people that Vitalik and Friends claim to
1271640	1276280	be working to save, but never once considers that the solutions offered might not actually
1276280	1280360	work, or that the people claiming to want to solve those problems might not even be
1280360	1281360	working on them.
1281360	1285760	That's actually a big issue, since the entire crypto space, during the entire time that
1285760	1290680	Rousseau's book covers, was absolutely awash with astroturfing schemes, where two guys
1290680	1295000	would go to some small community in Laos or Angola, take a bunch of pictures of people
1295000	1300160	at a crypto investing seminar, generate some headlines for their coin, or fund, and then
1300160	1301280	peace out.
1301280	1305640	For years, dudes were going around asking vendors if they could slap a bitcoin sticker
1305640	1310520	onto the back of the cash register, because the optics of making it look like a place
1310520	1315840	takes bitcoin was cheaper and easier than actually using bitcoin as a currency.
1315840	1321680	We have an entire decade of credulous articles about how Venezuela and Chile are on the verge
1321680	1327440	of switching entirely to crypto, based entirely on the claim of two trust fund dudes from
1327440	1332520	San Bernardino, a whole 10 years littered with discarded press releases about Dell and
1332520	1338680	Microsoft and Square bringing crypto to the consumers before just quietly discontinuing
1338680	1344240	their services after a year or two when they realize the demand isn't actually there.
1344240	1348800	The fact the development of Ethereum was extremely dependent on a $100,000 fellowship grant
1348800	1353480	from Peter Thiel is mentioned, but the ideological implications of that connection are never
1353480	1354480	explored.
1354480	1360400	The entire subject occupies a single paragraph sprinkled as flavor into a story about Vitalik
1360400	1364600	and his co-developers airing their grievances about some petty infighting.
1364600	1369040	The book is mostly useful for its value as a point of reference against reality.
1369040	1374360	It's a very thorough if uncritical document of absolutely insane claims.
1374360	1378600	The idea was that the traits of blockchain technology, such as having no central point
1378600	1383080	of failure, being uncensorable, cutting out intermediaries and being immutable, could
1383080	1386560	also benefit other applications besides money.
1386560	1390480	Financial instruments like stocks and bonds and commodities like gold were the obvious
1390880	1395000	but people were also talking about putting other representations of value like property
1395000	1398160	deeds and medical records on the blockchain too.
1398160	1402640	Those efforts, admirable considering Bitcoin hadn't and still hasn't been adopted widely
1402640	1405840	as currency, were known as Bitcoin 2.0.
1405840	1409640	I love this paragraph because it outlines just how disconnected from reality the people
1409640	1412520	actually building cryptocurrencies really are.
1412520	1416680	They don't understand anything about the ecosystems they're trying to disrupt.
1416680	1421040	They only know that these are things that can be conceptualized as valuable and assume
1421040	1426880	that because they understand one very complicated thing, programming with cryptography, that
1426880	1433000	all other complicated things must be lesser in complexity and naturally lower in the hierarchy
1433000	1437880	of reality, nails easily driven by the hammer that they have created.
1437880	1442920	The idea of putting medical records on a public decentralized trustless blockchain is absolutely
1442920	1446600	nightmarish and anyone who proposes it should be instantly discredited.
1446600	1451040	The fact that Rousseau fails to question any of this is journalistic malpractice.
1451040	1454960	Now in terms of improvements over Bitcoin, Ethereum has many.
1454960	1456360	It's not hard.
1456360	1457360	Bitcoin sucks.
1457360	1461040	In terms of problems with Bitcoin, Ethereum solves none of them and introduces a whole
1461040	1465960	new suite of problems driven by the technophetistic egotism of assuming that programmers are uniquely
1465960	1468360	suited to solve society's problems.
1468360	1473960	Vitalik wants his invention to be an infinite machine, so let's ask what that machine is
1473960	1480320	built to do.
1480320	1485000	In order to really understand the full scope of this, we do need to dig a bit more into
1485000	1489900	the technical aspects because that technical functionality informs the way that the rest
1489900	1491460	of the system behaves.
1491460	1496540	In a very McLuhanist way, the machine shapes the environment around it.
1496540	1501520	As already mentioned, a blockchain consists of two broad fundamental components, the ledger
1501520	1503720	and the consensus mechanism.
1503720	1507160	All currently popular blockchains use an append-only ledger.
1507160	1510240	Now this is, on its own, not that remarkable.
1510240	1514280	Append-only is just a database setting that only allows new entries to be added to the
1514280	1516160	end of the current database.
1516160	1519640	Once something is written to the database, it's read-only.
1519640	1523560	Standard applications are typically things like activity logs, which is conceptually
1523560	1527800	all a blockchain really is, a giant log of transactions.
1527800	1532280	The hitch is that it's decentralized, with elective participants hosting a complete copy
1532280	1539480	of the entire log, and this is where the second component comes in, the consensus mechanism.
1539480	1544240	All validating participants, called nodes, have a complete copy of the database, and
1544240	1547880	no one copy is considered to be the authoritative copy.
1547880	1552960	Instead, there is a consensus mechanism that determines which transactions actually happened.
1552960	1555280	This is all the proof-of-work stuff.
1555280	1559320	Proof-of-work isn't the only consensus mechanism, but it's popular because it's very easy
1559400	1563880	to implement by just cloning Bitcoin, and is resilient against the kind of attacks that
1563880	1565800	crypto enthusiasts care about.
1565800	1570120	It's a very brute force solution, but legitimately, if you want a network of ledgers where no
1570120	1575040	one trusts anyone else, just making everyone on the network do extreme amounts of wasted
1575040	1577680	duplicate work is a solution.
1577680	1581160	One of the major problems that this machine solves is what's called the double spend
1581160	1582160	problem.
1582160	1586000	How do you stop someone from spending the same dollar twice?
1586000	1590520	If someone tries, how do you determine which transaction really happened?
1590520	1595160	Banks solve this problem by not correlating account balance with any specific dollar,
1595160	1599880	processing transactions first come first serve, which they track with central resources, and
1599880	1603040	punishing users with overdraft fees for double spending.
1603040	1607720	Eschewing a central solution, cryptocurrencies rely on their consensus mechanism.
1607720	1612640	The most popular alternative to proof-of-work is proof-of-stake, where validators post-collateral
1612640	1617800	of some kind, usually whatever currency is endemic to the chain, with the amount of collateral
1617800	1623160	determining their odds of being rewarded the validation bounty for any given transaction.
1623160	1627880	The main proposal of proof-of-stake is that it significantly reduces the wasted power problems
1627880	1631480	of proof-of-work, but it's less resilient than proof-of-work.
1631480	1636120	On the energy cost side of things, proof-of-stake is still inefficient, just by virtue of the
1636120	1641240	sheer volume of redundancy, but on a per user basis it's at least inefficient on the
1641240	1646080	scale of, like, an MMO as opposed to a steel foundry.
1646080	1650720	This is difficult to assess because the most popular proof-of-stake chains are still unpopular
1650720	1654480	and low traffic in the scope of things, heavily centralized.
1654480	1658600	Claims about scalability are backed up by nothing but the creator's word.
1658600	1662260	Proof-of-stake is also significantly more complex, because there now needs to be some
1662260	1666680	mechanism for determining who gets to do the validations, and also determining how audits
1666680	1670360	are conducted and then the question of who has control over that system, and whether
1670360	1674920	or not someone can gain control of that system or control over the whole stake via just buying
1674920	1678200	out the staking pool, etc etc etc.
1678200	1682800	Proof-of-stake also even more explicitly rewards the wealthy who have the capital to both stake
1682800	1683800	and spend.
1683800	1686680	It's also even more explicitly exclusionary.
1686680	1691560	Ethereum's proposed proof-of-stake migration has a buy-in of 32 Ether, which at the time
1691560	1698200	of writing is about $130,000, so really only early adopters and the wealthy can actually
1698200	1701520	meaningfully participate for more than just crumbs.
1701520	1706140	This is, in turn, compounding inherent problems with the long-term growth of the chain.
1706140	1710600	Even if you solve the escalating power requirements of proof-of-work, the data requirements of
1710600	1715840	storing the chain and participating as a validator are also prohibitive in a way that
1715840	1719960	inevitably centralizes power in the hands of a few wealthy operators.
1719960	1749800	The major downside of all these
1750200	1752480	systems is that they're extremely slow.
1752480	1756240	Proof-of-work is inefficient by design, and proof-of-stake has multiple layers of lottery
1756240	1761640	that need to be executed before any transaction can be conducted, and, in particular, suffers
1761640	1766280	from delays when elected validators are offline and the system needs to draw again.
1766280	1770360	As an extension of being slow, they're also prone to getting overwhelmed if too many people
1770360	1775600	try to make transactions simultaneously, which can cause desyncs between validators and even
1775760	1780280	lead to what's called a fork, where two or more pools of validators reach a different
1780280	1785800	consensus about the state of the network, and each branch keeps on going afterwards
1785800	1788720	assuming that it is the authoritative version.
1788720	1794200	Forks can also be caused on purpose, and this is, in fact, the only way to effectively undo
1794200	1795800	transactions.
1795800	1800480	Like if someone stole your coins, the only way to get them back would be to convince the
1800480	1805480	people who manage the chain itself to negotiate a rollback.
1806360	1811360	Now, because the nature of a fork involves a disagreement on what transactions actually
1811360	1816560	happened, and who got paid for those transactions, this means that each arm of the fork has
1816560	1821920	a vested interest in its own arm being the authoritative arm, so resolving forks can
1821920	1827600	turn into irreconcilable schisms, which is funny as an outside observer viewing it as
1827600	1833360	an inane internet drama, but is frankly unacceptable for anything posturing as a serious and legitimate
1833360	1834360	currency.
1834360	1838040	And it's important to stress that because of the nature of the chain, the way that the
1838040	1844000	ID numbers of later blocks are dependent on the outcomes of previous blocks, these aren't
1844000	1849400	just a few disputed transactions that need to be resolved between the buyer, the seller,
1849400	1855760	and the payment processor, these are disagreements on the fundamental state of the entire economy
1855760	1859280	that create an entire alternate reality.
1859280	1864760	It's an ecosystem that absolutely demolishes consumer protections and makes the re-implementation
1864760	1867280	of them extremely difficult.
1867280	1871120	One of the big selling points of all this technology is that it's particularly secure,
1871120	1875280	very difficult for anyone to hack it directly since there's so much redundancy.
1875280	1879920	A lot of hay is made about the system's resiliency against man-in-the-middle attacks, which are
1879920	1882720	your classic Hollywood hacker type attacks.
1882720	1887900	Someone sends a command from point A and on the way to point B it is intercepted and altered.
1887900	1893100	Someone hacks into the bank and adds an arbitrary number of zeros onto their account balance.
1893100	1897180	Evangelists will commonly claim that blockchain could revolutionize the global shipping industry
1897180	1898780	and reduce fraud.
1898780	1900460	It's a good claim to interrogate.
1900460	1904620	First, the things that blockchain is capable of tracking are things that manufacturers and
1904620	1908620	shippers are already tracking, or at least trying to track.
1908620	1913300	So this is not so much revolution as it would be standardization.
1913300	1917780	Even that is built on a predicate assumption that everyone picks the same chain.
1917780	1920540	It's an extremely optimistic assumption.
1920540	1925460	Many many many firms deliberately want their information centralized and obfuscated to
1925460	1927540	protect against corporate espionage.
1927540	1932420	The lack of a shared standardized bucket to put all the information into is not because
1932420	1936300	it's being here to for impossible, but because it's being undesirable.
1936300	1941340	Second, it assumes the existence of a theoretical mechanism that ensures the synchronization
1941340	1947140	of the chain and reality above and beyond the current capacity of logistics software.
1947140	1952460	Problem means of preventing people from just lying to the blockchain and giving it the
1952460	1958340	information it expects to be receiving, the blockchain equivalent of ripping off the shipping
1958340	1960900	label and slapping it on the new box.
1960900	1965380	The bigger problem here is that in the pantheon of fraud, man in the middle attacks are actually
1965380	1966680	pretty rare.
1966680	1971100	Global shipping needs to deal with it in certain capacities, but taken on the whole, the vast
1971100	1975540	majority of fraud doesn't come from altering information as it passes between parties,
1975580	1980140	rather from colluding parties entering bad information at the start.
1980140	1984340	Con artists don't hack the gibson to transfer your funds to their offshore account, they
1984340	1986780	convince you to give them your password.
1986780	1992980	Most fraud comes from people who technically have permission to be doing what they're doing.
1992980	1996500	Rather than preventing these actual common types of fraud, cryptocurrency has made them
1996500	2001220	absurdly easy, and the main reason why cryptocurrency needs to be so resistant to man in the middle
2001220	2005980	attacks is because the decentralized nature of the network otherwise makes them acutely
2005980	2008180	vulnerable to those attacks.
2008180	2012380	What this all kind of means is that blockchains are all pretty bad at doing most of the things
2012380	2017700	they're trying to do, and a lot of the innovations in blockchains are attempts at solving problems
2017700	2019660	that blockchains introduced.
2019660	2023700	The biggest issue that cryptocurrencies have suffered from is a lack of tangible things
2023700	2028020	to actually use them on as currencies, rent or food or transit.
2028020	2030460	This is for pretty simple reasons.
2030460	2034460	One is that the transaction fees on popular chains are so prohibitive that it's pointless
2034460	2038660	to use them on any transaction that isn't hundreds if not thousands of dollars, no
2038660	2042820	one is going to buy the Bitcoin bucket from their local KFC.
2042820	2049660	Ethereum's main transaction fee, called gas, on a good day runs around $20 US per transaction,
2049660	2051780	but that's severely optimistic.
2051780	2057900	As of December 2021, the daily average cost of gas hasn't gone below $50 US since August,
2057900	2062220	with a three month daily average riding over $130.
2062220	2064740	And that's just the daily average.
2064740	2069180	The hourly price can and does swing by up to two orders of magnitude.
2069180	2072980	The throughput of blockchains is so abysmal that transaction slots are auctioned off to
2072980	2076340	the highest bidder, that's why these numbers are so extreme.
2076340	2080220	It only takes a few high rollers competing on a transaction to drive the hourly price
2080220	2083540	of gas up over $1000 US.
2083540	2087900	The internal term for this is a gas war, because it's just that common.
2087900	2092300	Bots, in particular, can drive gas prices well into the tens of thousands of dollars
2092300	2096320	as they compete to capitalize on mistakes, such as someone listing something for sale
2096320	2098620	well below its general market price.
2098620	2104300	Also, it needs to be stressed, these gas wars aren't localized to just the thing that's
2104300	2105300	being fought over.
2105300	2110380	If Steam is getting hammered because Concerned Ape posted Stardew Valley 2 by surprise,
2110380	2112860	that will probably stay pretty well contained.
2112860	2116980	If Taylor Swift concert tickets go on sale and Live Nation gets crushed, you might never
2116980	2118300	even know.
2118300	2124620	What those don't do is cause the cost of placing an order on drive through RPG to spike
2124620	2127220	by 8000% for three hours.
2127220	2131460	The second big reason is that value on the coins themselves is so volatile that unless
2131460	2135500	you're willing to engage with the speculative nature of the coins, there's actually a huge
2135500	2138700	risk in accepting them as payment for anything.
2138700	2142980	Bitcoin, in particular, owing to its glacial transaction times, suffers from problems where
2142980	2148000	the value of the coin can change dramatically between the start and end of a transaction.
2148000	2151820	This is such a problem that it's led to the rise of an entire strata of middlemen in the
2151820	2156820	ecosystem, so-called stablecoin exchanges like Tether that exist to quickly transfer
2156820	2160400	cryptocurrencies between each other and lock in values.
2160400	2164260	The stablecoins, rather than having a speculative value, have a value that's pegged to the
2164260	2167740	value of an actual currency, like the euro or US dollar.
2167740	2171740	The underlying problem that they exist to solve is itself twofold.
2171740	2175420	One is that converting cryptocurrency into dollars is the step of the process that makes
2175420	2179820	you accountable to the tax man, and the primary goal of crypto in general is to starve public
2179820	2181940	services, so that's a no-go.
2181940	2186260	The second is that there just aren't actually that many buyers, and there's not enough
2186260	2190220	liquidity in the ecosystem to cash out big holdings.
2190220	2195300	Tether, the largest stablecoin, used to advertise itself as being backed on a one-to-one basis
2195300	2199540	back when it was called realcoin, but that language has become far more nebulous over
2199540	2202860	time as it's become obvious that it just isn't true.
2202860	2206700	This is a very complicated situation, but the short version is that the people who own
2206700	2211460	Tether also own a real money exchange called Bitfinex, and there's evidence that the two
2211460	2216260	services, both which require having actual dollars on hand in order to back their products
2216260	2220980	and facilitate exchanges, are sharing the same pool of money, swapping it back and forth
2220980	2221980	as needed.
2221980	2227300	This means that at any given time, either service is potentially backed by zero dollars,
2227300	2231100	or at least that's what the data implies might be the case.
2231100	2235020	Point is that if you're a high roller with hundreds of millions of conceptual dollars
2235020	2238940	tied up in cryptocurrency, there's a fundamental cash problem.
2238940	2243340	Your holdings have inflated to tens, hundreds, or thousands of times what you put in, but
2243340	2246100	that price is just theoretical.
2246100	2247300	It's speculative.
2247300	2251900	You have all this crypto, you can't meaningfully spend it, and there's not enough buyers
2251900	2253620	for you to get it out.
2253620	2259420	In order for you to cash out, you need to convince someone else to buy in.
2259420	2264620	These factors, taken holistically, mean that cryptocurrency is a bigger fool's scam.
2264620	2269060	There's a lot of digital ink spilt trying to outline if it's a decentralized Ponzi
2269060	2274180	scheme or a pyramid scheme or some hybrid of the two, which is a taxonomical argument
2274180	2279140	that I'm not here to settle, but like both of those, it's a bigger fool's scam.
2279140	2283340	The whole thing operates by buying worthless assets, believing that you will later be able
2283340	2285580	to sell them to a bigger fool.
2285580	2289860	The entire structure of cryptocurrencies at their basic level of operation is designed
2289860	2294180	to deliver the greatest rewards to the earliest adopters, regardless of if you're talking
2294180	2296380	about proof of work or proof of stake.
2296380	2298720	This is inherent to their being.
2298720	2303580	As Stephen Deal put it, these schemes around crypto tokens cannot create or destroy actual
2303620	2306020	dollars, they can only shift them around.
2306020	2309900	If you sell your crypto and make a profit in dollars, it's only because someone else
2309900	2314700	bought it at a higher price than you did, and then they expect to do the same, and so
2314700	2317380	on and so on ad infinitum.
2317380	2321760	Every dollar that comes out of cryptocurrency needs to come from a later investor putting
2321760	2323220	a dollar in.
2323220	2327860	Crypto investments cannot be anything but a zero sum game, and many are actually massively
2327860	2329180	negative sum.
2329180	2333900	In order to presume a crypto investment functions as a store of value, we must simultaneously
2333900	2338940	need to suppose an infinite chain of greater fools who keep buying these assets at any
2338940	2343900	irrational price and into the future forever.
2343900	2347460	Alright with all that out of the way, let's talk about the ape in the room.
2360140	2362260	NFTs.
2362260	2364380	Non-fungible tokens.
2364380	2369540	On a conceptual level, the tech acts as a sort of generic database to mediate the exchange
2369540	2371560	of digital stuff.
2371560	2376580	The most optimistic read on it is a framework for a type of computer code that creates so-called
2376580	2382020	true digital objects, meaning digital objects that possess the attributes of both physical
2382020	2388060	objects and digital, being losslessly transmittable while providing strict uniqueness, which is
2388060	2390280	an important concept.
2390280	2395620	Strict uniqueness is a way of saying that two different things are different things,
2395620	2399700	even if they're different copies of the same thing.
2399700	2405780	My copy of Gray by EL James is strictly unique, while millions of copies of the book exist.
2405780	2412020	This is the only copy that is this copy, and this is the only copy that has the very specific
2412020	2416900	damage of being glued shut and thrown into the bow river.
2416900	2418860	It is also strictly scarce.
2418860	2424340	While millions of copies of Gray exist, that's still a finite number, meaning it is possible,
2424340	2429100	though not immediately practical, for the world to run out of copies.
2429100	2434180	NFTs impose a simulacrum of this physical scarcity and uniqueness onto digital objects
2434180	2437780	within their ecosystem.
2437780	2442660	On a technical level, non-fungible token is just a token that has a unique serial number
2442660	2445900	and can't be subdivided into smaller parts.
2445900	2451820	Two tokens, even two that tokenize the same conceptual thing, are still strictly unique
2451820	2453900	with different serial numbers.
2453900	2458520	Within the context of Ethereum and its clones, these tokens are effectively a small packet
2458520	2461860	of data that can contain a payload of code.
2461860	2465500	It's a box that you can put a micro-program into.
2465500	2469860	That micro-program is called a smart contract, a name that is so comically full of itself
2469860	2474380	that I feel like it's misleading to even call them that, but I have to for simplicity's
2474380	2475380	sake.
2475500	2479900	Real quick, yes, that is how the inventors conceptualize the role of these things, as
2479900	2482220	the unity of programming and law.
2482220	2486560	The phrase Code is Law gets bandied about as an aphorism, and it's just so full of
2486560	2490180	holes that we're going to be spending the next forever talking about it.
2490180	2492380	Before we move into that, this is the root of it.
2492380	2497100	There is a tremendous disconnect between what NFT advocates say they do and what they actually
2497100	2498100	do.
2498100	2504100	But, and this is very important, both the claimed functionality and the actual functionality
2504180	2505620	are both bad.
2505620	2510980	It's all broken, none of it works well, so the idea of it becoming the norm is terrible,
2510980	2515740	but the prospect of what the world would look like if all the mythologizing and over-promising
2515740	2519140	came true also super sucks.
2519140	2524060	The end goal of this infamous machine is the financialization of everything.
2524060	2529420	Any benefits of digital uniqueness end up being a quirk, a necessary precondition of
2529420	2532420	turning everything into a stock market.
2532420	2537700	There's nothing particularly offensive underpinning the concept of digital collectibles, frameworks
2537700	2544140	and subcultures for forms of digital collectibles have existed for decades within various contexts,
2544140	2551380	but NFTs exist to lend credibility and functionality to the cryptocurrencies that they exist on
2551380	2552540	top of.
2552540	2554380	Okay, okay.
2554380	2555380	Code is Law.
2555380	2560380	Now, what that little smart contract program does is up to the token creator.
2560380	2565340	It can be a relatively sophisticated applet that allows the user to execute various commands,
2565340	2571300	or it can be a plain hypertext linked to a static URL of an image, or anything in between.
2571300	2575820	Most are a lot closer to static URLs than they are to functional programs.
2575820	2580700	This is in part because the thing that NFTs have become synonymous with are digital artworks,
2580700	2584220	but really what the token represents is arbitrary.
2584220	2588860	It can be a video game item, a permission slip, a subscription, a domain name, a virus
2588860	2592860	that steals all your digital stuff, or a combination of all of those.
2592860	2596780	Well the concept has been floating around since 2015 when the framework was thrown together
2596780	2601420	in a day during a hackathon and the first Ethereum implemented tokens were minted in
2601420	2602420	2017.
2602420	2607900	For the mainstream, the story starts in the spring of 2021 following a string of high
2607900	2614540	priced sales of tokens minted by digital artist Beeple, culminating in a $69 million sale
2614540	2619660	of a collage of Beeple's work in March via old money auction house Christie's.
2619660	2625020	This high profile sale triggered a media frenzy and an online gold rush as various minor internet
2625020	2630100	celebrities raced to cash in on the trend, hoping to be the next to cash out big.
2630100	2634620	Over the course of about six weeks, the ecosystem burnt through just about every relevant meme
2634620	2635620	possible.
2635620	2640380	Laina Morris, popularized on Reddit as overly attached girlfriend, sold the original screen
2640380	2644780	grab to Emirati music producer Fars and Fard and Fard for the equivalent of a little over
2644780	2646940	$400,000 US.
2646940	2651980	Zoe Roth, aka Disaster Girl, sold the NFT of the original Disaster Girl photograph to
2651980	2654860	Fard for also $400,000.
2654860	2661180	Kyle Craven sold the original Bad Luck Brian photo for $36,000 to anonymous buyer At-A.
2661180	2667340	Nayan Kat sold for almost $600,000 with multiple variants also selling for six figures.
2667420	2673140	Ellison Harvard sold Creepy Chan 1 and 2 for $67,000 and $83,000 respectively, also
2673140	2674300	both to Fard.
2674300	2678500	In addition to these high profile sales of things that were already popular, whale buyers
2678500	2683860	like Fard were dropping four and five figure sales onto a random assortment of other artworks.
2683860	2687940	Corporations and individuals auctioned off NFTs representing intangible, non-transferable
2687940	2692260	concepts like the first tweet or the first text message.
2692260	2697540	Pico Currency Evangelist jumped at every opportunity to proselytize this new, bold, revolutionary
2697540	2701980	marketplace that would free artists from the yoke of the gig economy and provide buyers
2701980	2707860	with an immutable record of ownership of authenticated artwork stored on an eternal distributed machine.
2707860	2710980	You could be holding the next generation's Picasso.
2710980	2715180	Artists could continue to earn passive revenue from secondary sales.
2715180	2718060	Imagine what it'll be worth in five years.
2718060	2722220	This created an error of absolute mania as it seemed like anything could be the golden
2722220	2723220	ticket.
2723220	2726980	Digital artists, especially those working with media like generative art that's difficult
2726980	2732180	to monetize via conventional channels like physical prints, raced into the space and,
2732180	2734860	on the whole, lost a lot of money.
2734860	2738180	Critics began questioning what it was that was actually being bought and sold.
2738180	2742620	Copyright, commercial permission, a digital file, bragging rights?
2742620	2746900	In a huge number of cases the answer wasn't very clear and even the sellers caught in
2746900	2751940	the promise of a payday weren't all together sure what they had even sold.
2751940	2756020	Tons of the tokens did little more than point to images stored on normal servers readily
2756020	2761540	accessible via HTTP, meaning the bought assets would be just as vulnerable to Linkrot as
2761540	2762740	anything else.
2762740	2768500	Some pointed to images stored on peer-to-peer IPFS servers, which are more resistant to
2768500	2774820	Linkrot as similar to a torrent, it only requires that someone keep the file active somewhere
2774860	2779580	rather than requiring the original server to stay up, but as millions of dead torrents
2779580	2785220	prove that's still a far cry from the eternal storage solution that evangelists were claiming.
2785220	2789580	The images were stored and delivered the same way as any other image on the internet, easily
2789580	2794340	saved or duplicated simply by virtue of the fact that in order for your computer to display
2794340	2797140	an image it needs to download it.
2797140	2803580	Claims of digital scarcity apply only to the token itself, not the thing the token signified.
2803620	2808020	More than that, there was no cryptographic relationship between the image and the tokens.
2808020	2812980	The image associated with a token could be easily altered or replaced if the person with
2812980	2819140	access to the server that the image was hosted on just changed file names, making the relationship
2819140	2824180	between the two tenuous and flimsy in a way that undermined the claims that this was somehow
2824180	2829100	a more durable, reliable way of transacting digital art.
2829100	2834100	There was also no root proof of authenticity, no confirmation that the person minting the
2834100	2837180	artwork was the person who created the artwork.
2837180	2841740	This is a pretty handy encapsulation of the way that blockchain fails to solve the most
2841740	2847260	common problems with fraud, which tend to start with bad data going into a system at
2847260	2851500	the input, not data being altered midstream.
2851500	2855820	Artists who complained about this system, which clearly incentivized impersonating popular
2855900	2861100	artists, including deceased artists, were told that it was their fault for not jumping
2861100	2866060	in sooner, that if they had bought in and minted their stuff first, then it would have
2866060	2868580	been easy to prove the forgeries.
2868580	2872820	Because evangelists don't see this as a tool, as a market that may or may not fit into
2872820	2876220	an artist's business, they see it as the future.
2876220	2881060	So failure to participate isn't a business decision, it's just a mistake.
2881060	2882380	They're terrible people.
2882380	2884300	All told, the frenzy collapsed pretty quickly.
2884300	2889300	By June, the market had already receded by about 90%, which incidentally just further
2889300	2893420	incentivized the low effort process of minting other people's artwork to the point that
2893420	2898460	art platform DeviantArt implemented an extremely well-received feature that scanned several
2898460	2901980	popular NFT marketplaces for matching images.
2901980	2905380	The output of that is extremely depressing.
2905380	2909820	Not to labor the point, but reposting digital art without attribution is nothing new.
2909820	2912860	Profiting off someone else's art is also nothing new.
2912860	2917460	All that's new is NFTs represent a high-energy marketplace with an irrational pricing culture
2917460	2921180	where the main buyer is easily flattered and not particularly discerning.
2921180	2925820	The potential payoff is extremely high, much, much higher than a bootleg red bubble store,
2925820	2930580	the consequences border on non-existent, and the market is clearly in an untenable state
2930580	2935620	so there's an incentive to get in at as low a cost as possible before it collapses, hence
2935620	2937640	the absolute plague of art theft.
2937640	2941140	Even the argument that artists could make passive revenue off secondary sales turned
2941220	2942980	out to have a lot of caveats attached.
2942980	2947060	One, the smart contract for the token needs to have a function that defines royalties
2947060	2951340	so anyone who minted a token based off of hype, making it sound like an inherent function
2951340	2953460	of the system, was out of luck.
2953460	2958260	And two, the token doesn't know what a sale is and can't differentiate between being
2958260	2964300	sold and being transferred, so it's actually the marketplace that informs the token you're
2964300	2967140	being sold and collects the royalties.
2967140	2971180	And result, royalties are easily bypassed simply by using a marketplace that doesn't
2971180	2975380	collect royalties, or uses a different format of royalty collection that's incompatible
2975380	2977380	with the function the token uses.
2977380	2981820	While a few sellers, legitimate and otherwise, made off with undeniably big paydays, hundreds
2981820	2986160	of thousands of artists bought in only to find that there wasn't a new revolutionary
2986160	2990780	highly trafficked audience of digital art collectors, instead there was a closed market
2990780	2995180	dealing in casino chips where the primary winners were those already connected who already
2995180	2999300	had the means to get the attention of the whales in the media, a market where participation
2999300	3003820	required buying into a cryptocurrency at a rapidly fluctuating price in order to pay
3003820	3007780	the minting cost to post the work where it would sit unsold.
3007780	3011380	This led those artists in the lurch where they had to choose between just eating the
3011380	3015620	losses or attempting to convince their existing audience to buy in as well.
3015620	3020380	The people who actually won were the people with large holdings of cryptocurrencies, specifically
3020380	3024460	Ethereum which mediated the vast majority of these big ticket purchases.
3024460	3028380	David Gerard, author of Attack of the Fifty Foot Blockchain, summarized it on his blog
3028380	3030220	very succinctly as such.
3030220	3033340	NFTs are entirely for the benefit of the crypto grifters.
3033340	3038300	The only purpose the artists serve is as aspiring suckers to pump the concept of crypto, and
3038300	3042180	of course to buy cryptocurrency to pay for minting NFTs.
3042180	3045580	Sometimes the artist gets some crumbs to keep them pumping the concept of crypto.
3045580	3047700	The rush benefits them in two ways.
3047700	3052000	First, the price of Ether itself goes up directly from the spike in demand.
3052040	3056800	In January and May, the price of Ether rose from $700 to $4,000.
3056800	3061500	And second, there's new, actual buyers who aren't just trading bitcoin for tether for
3061500	3065900	Ether and back again, but are buying in with dollars, providing the whole system with the
3065900	3069400	liquidity needed for whales to actually cash out.
3069400	3074160	This arrangement, needing to buy a highly volatile coin from people who paid far far
3074160	3079080	less for it in order to participate in a market that they control, is why people reflexively
3079080	3081240	describe the whole arrangement as a scam.
3081240	3086560	If you buy in at $4,000 and compete against people who bought in at $4, you're the sucker.
3086560	3090680	It reveals the basic truth that these aren't marketplaces, they're casinos.
3090680	3095200	And indeed, even through all the rhetoric of protecting artists and whatnot was the ever-present
3095200	3097000	specter of the gamble.
3097000	3101680	Whatever you buy now might be worth hundreds of times more later, constantly invoked as
3101680	3104520	the opposite proposition of the bad deal.
3104520	3108880	What if you had been the person who bought in at $4?
3108880	3114320	Let's take a closer look at that eye-watering $69 million Beeple sale.
3114320	3118400	Independent journalist Amy Castor has done an enviable job running down the details here
3118400	3124040	in her piece MetaCovin, the Mystery Beeple Art Buyer and his NFT DeFi Scheme.
3124040	3127480	But to summarize it along as short of her notes, the buyer is a crypto entrepreneur named
3127480	3131880	Vignesh Sundaresan who purchased the piece to boost the reputation and value of his own
3131880	3138360	crypto investment scheme Metapurse and Metapurse's own token, B20, which Beeple owns 2% of the
3138360	3140280	total supply of.
3140280	3145560	Following the Christie sale, the reported value of B20 went from 36 cents per token
3145560	3147560	to $23.
3147560	3149880	And that's just the anatomy of a single sale.
3149880	3154480	The very obvious conclusion observers reached was that none of this is about the art at
3154480	3157160	all, but the speculative value.
3157160	3161320	Not what it's worth to you, but what it'll potentially be worth in the future to someone
3161320	3162320	else.
3162320	3165800	It's not a market, it's a casino, gambling on the receipt for an image or video that
3165800	3168080	otherwise infinitely digitally replicable.
3168080	3173040	The thing itself is immaterial as long as it can make a line go up.
3173040	3178080	This is the essence of the market and a microcosm of what evangelists imagine they want to see
3178080	3181640	as the future, the financialization of everything.
3181640	3185880	The frenzied market around old Reddit memes was doomed from the start, there's a finite
3185880	3191920	supply of meaningful originals, so to keep this thing going, to keep the line going up,
3191920	3197320	you need something more, something less tied to anything specific.
3197560	3200320	Sir, the Lambo's ready.
3200320	3201320	What?
3204320	3208120	In the months since the initial craze, the marketplace had mutated.
3208120	3212400	The it thing was no longer memes or digital works from established artists, but character
3212400	3217320	profiles from large, procedurally generated collections with names like CryptoPunks, Bored
3217320	3222800	Ape Yacht Club, Lazy Lions, Cool Cats, Ethergals, Gatorworld, Baby Lana Club, Magic Mushroom
3222800	3226000	Club, Rogue Society Bot, and Crypto Chicks.
3226000	3230720	These were notable for, again, commanding utterly irrational prices, seemingly completely
3230720	3237760	decoupled from any legitimate or legal transaction, and being generally extremely fuggly.
3237760	3242280	This surge generated an immediately adversarial relationship between the buyers, who touted
3242280	3247280	them as both evidence of their extravagant wealth and their foresight into the future
3247280	3251400	of digital economies, and pretty much everyone else.
3251400	3256200	A very common response to anyone using one of these profile pics, or ragging about their
3256200	3261160	purchase, became saving and reposting the image in reply, or even changing profile
3261160	3262600	pics to match.
3262600	3266520	Spurred by a speculative tweet from Twitter developers suggesting that they were working
3266520	3272080	on an NFT verification system, Twitter users broadly rallied at the opportunity to immediately
3272080	3274880	identify people that it was okay to bully.
3274880	3279160	Tweets from within the crypto sphere started leaking out, things like Santiago Santos tweeting
3279160	3285120	things like, NFTs equal Identity 2.0, can't remember the last time I used my pic on the
3285120	3291400	left, emphasis on physical traits, genetic lottery, prone to bias and prejudice, identity
3291400	3297080	by choice, unique and digitally scarce, representation of values and beliefs.
3297080	3302800	Of course what Santiago was leaving out was that he had paid the equivalent of $171,000
3302800	3308840	US for that profile pic, which probably gives him some incentive to really commit to it
3308840	3314960	as something interesting and special, even though stripped to the studs, literally all
3314960	3320360	he was describing was using a non-representational image as a profile pic.
3320360	3327080	For about six years, my profile on the Dungeons & Dragons forums was a stock photo of a cabbage,
3327080	3331080	so not really breaking new ground here.
3331080	3336520	Greg Eisenberg sat at his computer and decided to bang out most people who make fun of NFTs,
3336520	3342160	own zero NFTs, have never minted an NFT, have never participated in a community, have never
3342160	3347800	staked their NFT, haven't built on top of an NFT project, have never earned an NFT playing
3347800	3351600	a game, missed out on bake, punks, cool cats, etc.
3351600	3356840	A chain of logic implying that skeptics of the market are just uninformed sore losers.
3356840	3361000	Incidents like these lent to the very accurate perception that the loudest voices in NFTs
3361000	3365680	weren't very familiar with internet culture as a whole, weren't terribly smart in general,
3365680	3370000	and were by and large coming at all this from the financial side, further supported by all
3370000	3374160	of them having tweets or not investment advice in their Twitter bios.
3374160	3377480	In short, the same people who made and bought Juicero.
3377480	3380480	What is this?
3380480	3382960	It's a Juicero.
3382960	3386320	It also laid bare that the conversations were inherently suspect.
3386320	3392560	How can you ever trust the sincerity of someone telling you how awesome their $171,000 investment
3392560	3398960	is when your persuasion stands to directly benefit them by potentially driving up the
3398960	3401400	value of their investment portfolio?
3401400	3409320	You've got to be extremely rich for $171,000 to not be an extremely sunk cost, and that's
3409320	3414000	absolutely going to weigh on your mind and influence how you see the market.
3414000	3418040	So for my part, I tweeted about several of these incidences and was in response hounded
3418120	3422840	for days by annoying people with NFT profile pics who insisted that I just didn't get
3422840	3423840	it.
3423840	3426000	I wasn't seeing the community.
3426000	3428000	So I decided to go see the community.
3428000	3430480	My experiment started with the Cool Cats Discord.
3430480	3434200	One of the communities that I'd been assured was top of the pile.
3434200	3440160	I joined, read back through days and days of conversation logs, watched the active conversations,
3440160	3442680	and was generally unimpressed.
3442680	3444360	It was at best unremarkable.
3444360	3448840	A primary concern was still rooted in the monetary value of the tokens.
3448840	3452520	If you spend $1,000,000 on a cat, it's not just for Twitter and no one would be happy
3452520	3455280	seeing someone mint another one later for free.
3455280	3461440	That's why punks are at $120,000, symbols, memes, there's the value.
3461440	3465880	What wasn't unremarkable is the way that I was immediately deluged by bots sending
3465880	3468080	me invites to other discords.
3468080	3473440	So between the spam I was receiving and the Cool Cats dedicated shill channel, I came
3473440	3493080	up with an idea.
3493080	3498200	For days now I've been accepting every spam NFT Discord invite I've received, and it's
3498200	3499440	getting dire.
3499440	3504240	Stoner Cats, Oni Ronan, Magic Mushroom Club, NF Tits, The Humanoids, EtherGal's, Cool
3504240	3508800	Cats, Senzu Seeds, Pro Camel Riders, Long Wean Club, Stick Humans, Bumping Uglies,

3553280	3557920	about as far as I got before more or less giving up and finally shutting off Discord
3557920	3558920	DMs.
3558920	3563600	Now this is a fraction of a fraction of what's out there, but I do think it's a pretty
3563600	3566960	representative sample, and I learned a lot.
3566960	3571600	For example, the basic psychological profile of the average buyer is someone who is tenuously
3571600	3575600	middle class, socially isolated, and highly responsive to memes.
3575600	3580280	They are someone who has very little experience with real businesses and production processes,
3580280	3585120	thus are unlikely to be turned off by unrealistic claims about future returns.
3585120	3590160	They are insecure about their lack of knowledge, and this makes them very susceptible to flattery,
3590160	3595400	in particular being assured that the only reason for negativity is because critics just
3595400	3598040	don't understand what they understand.
3598040	3602640	Being tenuously middle class gives them enough disposable income to engage with a pretty expensive
3602640	3607840	system but also a very potent anxiety about their financial future.
3607840	3611480	It goes without saying that they're fixated on money and they principally understand the
3611480	3614760	technology as a means of making money.
3614760	3617760	Criticism of the system is typically met with confusion.
3617760	3619760	Don't you want to make money?
3619760	3624800	I also learned a lot about fraud and how to do it both on purpose and by accident.
3624800	3629400	The term rug pull, with its derivations rug and rug, all to describe projects that made
3629400	3634560	big promises but then took the money and ran, embedded themselves in my vocabulary extremely
3634560	3635560	quickly.
3635640	3638720	It's just absolutely lousy with fraud and deception.
3638720	3642280	Wash trading, where you sell something to your own sock puppets in order to lure in
3642280	3645920	real buyers who think they're getting a good deal, is rampant.
3645920	3650200	Market manipulation is so common and accepted that it's actually considered bad form if
3650200	3652840	project leaders don't actively engage in it.
3652840	3657520	Like it's considered disrespectful to the buyers if the project leaders don't help
3657520	3660120	them inflate the resale price.
3660120	3665120	Also, and I really should not leave this merely implied, the art is bad, but not in any sort
3665160	3666520	of interesting way.
3666520	3670880	It's bad in a smoothed over copycat way, a low effort garbage dump from artists who
3670880	3674240	have largely given up on having ideas or opinions.
3674240	3676880	Derivative, lazy, ugly, hollow, and boring.
3676880	3680320	The capacity for original thought, long having been drained out of the illustrators, kept
3680320	3684520	in the employ and proximity of people who refused to shut up about cryptocurrency, there was
3684520	3689200	an overwhelming tendency to fall back on stale memes and self-flattery.
3689200	3694600	A massive volume of cryptocurrency art ends up being art about cryptocurrency, transparent
3694640	3699280	pandering to an audience that is either deeply stupid or easily pleased and quite possibly
3699280	3700280	both.
3700280	3703800	Absent any artistic insight, the vacuum is instead filled overflowing with references
3703800	3708800	to doge memes, bitcoin, ethereum, stonks, to the moon, by the dip, good morning, and
3708800	3713600	desperate pleas for senpai Elon Musk to notice them, all presented with the earnestness and
3713600	3716000	authenticity of a pickle-rick bong.
3716000	3720280	It's tempting to say that my approach, accepting every spam invite, was a really flawed way
3720360	3725320	to delve deeper, that obviously accepting invites from spam bots would mainly lead me
3725320	3729480	into less stable projects, but surprisingly no.
3729480	3734120	I got just as much spam for successful projects as humanoids and NFT worlds as I did for
3734120	3737000	rug pulls like crypto astronauts and hoodpunks.
3737000	3740720	On the whole, if you just look at the pitch package and the sample product, there's very
3740720	3744800	little material difference between a project that's going to sell out 10,000 tokens in
3744800	3748840	six hours and one that's going to become a trash fire as the project leader has a nervous
3748920	3753600	breakdown and burns the mint three days post-launch after only selling 800 tokens.
3753600	3758080	Party 8 billionaire clubs sold out, bringing in about $3.2 million and are now flexing
3758080	3762600	their wealth by partnering with other crypto projects like the two-chains-produced NFT
3762600	3768720	cartoon show The Red Ape Family, which is just really truly shows off the community's deep
3768720	3773320	pockets and commitment to quality.
3773320	3777800	Deep in their roadmap is the promise that they will start production on an MMORPG, a
3777800	3780920	claim that buyers are entirely faithful in.
3780920	3789440	Crypto astronauts sold 1,262 of their 9,485 tokens, bringing in an impressive $375,000,
3789440	3793520	but as nice as that number is, it's not remotely enough to even start proceeding on their plan
3793520	3796320	to build a full-scale PVP-based MMO.
3796320	3800680	Following the failed mint in October, the dev slowly went quiet and then bit by bit,
3800680	3805600	website, social media accounts, and eventually the Discord itself all disappeared.
3805600	3811240	Based off the ostensible product, why should one of these succeed and the other fail?
3811240	3815680	The key distinction ultimately between a party 8 billionaire club and crypto astronauts
3815680	3820560	is that P.A.B.C. was already flushed with cash and able to manufacture hype with high-priced
3820560	3825320	giveaways and expensive advertising, buying advertising space in Times Square in particular
3825320	3827200	as a specific fixation.
3827200	3831360	But running a 10-second ad every 8 minutes on one out-of-the-way billboard in Times Square
3831360	3834040	isn't effective advertising, not externally.
3834040	3839200	All it's really good for is internal propaganda, making insiders feel like the money they've
3839200	3841360	spent is buying credibility.
3841360	3845400	And if you're in a speculative bubble, betting that someone down the line will buy you out
3845400	3855400	for more than you bought in, credibility is worth everything in the world.
3855400	3857480	This is pervasive.
3857480	3861280	Even in the most established projects, ones that have been going for years, there's not
3861280	3864240	really an underlying thing.
3864240	3868160	These aren't fandoms in the way that you would experience them around a game or a TV
3868160	3869500	show or a book.
3869500	3874160	The product is pretty insubstantial, if not functionally non-existent.
3874160	3878040	This is where these projects diverged significantly from the artworks that drove the speculative
3878040	3879640	mania in the spring.
3879640	3884000	They're not positioning themselves as art that's worth possessing for the art, as flimsy
3884000	3889800	and illusory as that claim was, but as ongoing projects that you buy into.
3889800	3895240	The purchase of a token is an abstracted version of buying early stock in a company, a venture
3895240	3900440	capital style investment in promises, which is a very significant mutation.
3900440	3905120	Okay, so what do these phantom companies claim to exist to do?
3905120	3909760	Pretty much all of them promise direct financial returns in some way, shape, or form.
3909760	3913840	Sometimes this is just a nebulous sense that the whole thing will go to the moon, meaning
3913840	3917760	the value of the tokens will take off and thus early buyers will be able to resell for
3917760	3923120	huge profits, or more direct as the project leaders promised the formation of, effectively,
3923120	3928080	an unofficial hedge fund investing a communal pool into other crypto products.
3928080	3932000	Probably the funniest of all of these was Betting Kongs, which wanted to create an unregistered
3932000	3937640	real money casino in which token holders would be explicitly part-owners and also permitted
3937640	3940640	to gamble in the casino that they owned.
3940640	3944960	Betting Kongs is not your ordinary NFT project.
3944960	3950840	We aim to create passive income for our NFT owners by co-owning a casino with a profit
3950840	3951840	split.
3951840	3955680	Welcome to the White Paper, fellow gamblers.
3955680	3957360	Why are we doing this?
3957360	3962640	To put it short, we love gambling and we noticed how a lot of the operators are at their own
3962640	3969000	by large corporations who have no care for the community or the service they provide.
3969000	3973640	We want to provide a project where everyone playing can be a co-owner of the place they're
3973640	3977080	playing at and make money from it all.
3977080	3982040	Failure was probably the best outcome for everyone here, if we're being honest.
3982040	3987480	Some promise this in the form of a more conventional media project like a comic book or a cartoon
3987480	3990600	or a movie or all of the above.
3990600	3997400	We have planned the creation of a series of comics dedicated to the pixel girl.
3997400	4003360	The key image is static, or at least we think so now, but the squeaky girl is still a seductress
4003560	4010320	so the image of breasts will be presented in various variations that our community will
4010320	4011320	approve.
4011320	4015880	Let's imagine there are 5,000 NF Tits holders.
4015880	4020200	There is a 30 million market of comics lovers in the US.
4020200	4026080	On average, every comic lover spends around 20 USD per comic per week.
4026080	4031400	It means 80 dollars per month and 960 dollars per year.
4031400	4040400	The total addressable market is worth 28,800,000,000 USD.
4040400	4044720	Let's imagine we take 1% of this market.
4044720	4056120	It's 288,000,000 USD per year on the base of monthly subscriptions raised in crypto.
4056120	4058760	This is a cash flow.
4058760	4063400	Nice to see some active communication and appreciate the effort as announced this afternoon
4063400	4066560	trying to resurrect this project into something successful.
4066560	4071120	The only thing I would like to see, assuming the project can be successfully turned around,
4071120	4075520	is to perhaps, in addition to some revenue sharing, have some revenue donated to breast
4075520	4076800	cancer research.
4076800	4080640	To truly enjoy them, we should keep them happy and healthy.
4080640	4087240	As already implied, many of them promise video games, often an MMO, but just as often, like,
4088200	4091000	the concept of a video game?
4091000	4093480	Okay, wait, let me word that another way.
4093480	4095920	They will promise a video game.
4095920	4098240	Like that's the promise, in its entirety.
4098240	4103960	No clues for genre, style, scope, engine or platform or how any of the tokens would interact
4103960	4104960	with it.
4104960	4106280	Just a video game.
4106280	4111520	If we sell 10,000 tokens for 300 dollars each, we will start brainstorming development
4111520	4114160	ideas for a video game.
4114160	4118400	Now all of these tend to be in collections of 10,000, and there's actually an interesting
4118400	4120240	sort of quirk inside that.
4120240	4125400	The initial format was to mint an entire collection and just shove them out onto the market.
4125400	4130200	The cap comes into play purely because you have to tell the program generating the garbage
4130200	4131600	when to stop.
4131600	4136560	However, as the scheme started to take off and competition rose, it became obvious that
4136560	4142280	this was a suckers way of doing it because that meant paying gas fees on everything upfront.
4142280	4146480	So someone came up with a system for minting a random output on demand, which shuffles
4146480	4149280	the mint cost off onto the buyer.
4149280	4152040	From there it all took off like wildfire.
4152040	4156840	Very low upfront cost, extremely low risk, plus it turns the entire system into a gotcha
4156840	4160040	game with different rarity curves for attributes.
4160040	4165240	At best, these are all obfuscated gambling schemes, at worst, active scams.
4165240	4171960	And the payoff of failure makes it extremely difficult to parse one of those from the other.
4171960	4178800	World of Wojak only sold 20 tokens to 11 people and still pocketed over $5,000.
4178800	4185480	Pro Camel Riders sold 114 tokens to 71 buyers and took home $25,000.
4185480	4195360	Metamon sold 722 of their 9999 tokens to 343 buyers and walked off with $211,000.
4195360	4201800	Because the average buy-in is over 350 bucks, the payday for failure makes it irrational
4201800	4203400	to succeed.
4203400	4207200	The interesting aspect of it, though, is the emergent fiction of it.
4207200	4211600	These smoke vendors don't have an actual product more complex than the output of a vending
4211600	4216880	machine in the front of a grocery store, so they need a story to sell instead.
4216880	4221520	And so we get this wave of poorly defined projects pitching a token with an attached
4221520	4226000	JPEG that represents the concept of a thing that could become a future business.
4226000	4230960	What that business does is unimportant, and indeed many of these projects, successful
4230960	4236040	and otherwise, trade in a flattering myth of decentralization where the direction
4236040	4241920	of the business down to its fundamental product is shunted into the indeterminate future to
4241920	4245160	be decided later by collective consensus.
4245160	4251200	Are we a comic book, a movie, a hedge fund, a casino, or a bimonthly curated box of snacks?
4251200	4254080	Well, that's for the token holders to decide.
4254080	4259680	All that matters is that whatever it is, it will definitely make the value of your tokens
4259680	4264560	go up, so you should definitely buy two.
4264560	4268840	One thing I learned about NFTs, if you think something's going to be a blue chip, you should
4268840	4272400	definitely buy at least two, because you're going to get one emotionally attached to one
4272400	4276600	of them, and you're not going to want to sell it because NFTs are going to explode all over
4276600	4277760	the world.
4277760	4282800	And if you've got a blue chip today, it's going to be incredibly more valuable in five
4282800	4286880	years from now, or even three years from now, or even two years from now than it is today.
4286880	4291040	On the front of otherwise respectable, or at least established, brands and people getting
4291040	4296400	into NFTs, the results tend to be extremely tepid and insubstantial, even by the standards
4296400	4297800	of NFTs.
4297800	4302680	Very low risk, low quality, low engagement tokens, shoveled out the door to capitalize
4302680	4311640	on a hot buzzword, chasing the cash that's sloshing around.
4311640	4316360	Tied up in all of this, there's an extremely pervasive resistance to any form of skepticism
4316360	4319880	that ultimately manifests as a sort of toxic positivity.
4319880	4322600	This is all part of a complex feedback loop.
4322600	4327600	The projects, broadly speaking, lack any kind of substantial product, existing almost entirely
4327600	4333080	as promises backed by nothing more than a screenshot of a roadmap and some sample PFPs.
4333080	4336520	And again, I think it's really important to keep in mind that that goes for successful
4336520	4338960	projects just as much as for rug pulls.
4338960	4342840	There really isn't any meaningful difference between a party-ape billionaire club and a
4342840	4343840	betting Kongs.
4343840	4348360	Betting Kongs were never going to make a casino, even if they hadn't tanked, and despite the
4348360	4354360	fact that they were running billboards in Times Square, P-A-B-C is never making an MMORPG.
4354360	4359120	Both claims are equally ridiculous, but one of the two made a huge pile of money.
4359120	4363760	The primary product is ultimately hype, which is both insubstantial and fickle.
4363760	4368460	Negativity, both internal and external, can have a meaningful impact on the willingness
4368460	4373880	of people to buy into a project, and if buyers are tepid then you won't get a runaway sale,
4373880	4378240	and if you don't get a runaway sale then that's going to turn off buyers even more,
4378240	4383080	which means the secondary market for tokens will likely fail to materialize.
4383080	4386040	This is what makes enthusiasts so deeply unreliable.
4386040	4390680	They have meaningful financial stakes and an intangible, volatile thing that exists entirely
4390680	4396280	as a collective idiom, a story about a potential future outcome whose value is based entirely
4396280	4397880	on public perception.
4397880	4402320	You can't trust what they have to say because they're currently holding a hot potato, and
4402320	4407120	as much as they insist that they just really, really enjoy the feeling of a burning hot
4407120	4410000	potato in their hands, do they?
4410000	4412120	Or are they just hoping that you'll catch it?
4412120	4416200	This creates an environment of toxic positivity where doubt is aggressively policed by both
4416200	4420480	project leaders who have an obvious financial interest in hype since their big payday is
4420480	4425760	the minting rush, and community members themselves who have a speculative financial interest in
4425760	4426760	hype.
4426760	4430800	While all of that is logical in the pure sense that there is an effect that can be explained
4430800	4436120	by an incentive, the output is effectively a self-organizing high-control group.
4436120	4440980	Doubters are ostracized so aggressively that it chills all conversation about a project's
4440980	4442700	actual viability.
4442700	4447460	All concerns are just fud, fear, uncertainty, and doubt.
4447460	4451620	Questions that would be utterly banal in any other investment forum, what has the team
4451620	4452620	done?
4452620	4453620	What assets do they have?
4453620	4458700	Why should anyone believe that they can deliver on their promises are treated as hostile?
4458700	4462100	And the Frank reality is because there aren't answers.
4462100	4468160	Party 8 Billionaire Club is just as vaporous, and yet they superficially succeeded, so there's
4468160	4471800	incentive to enforce the collective illusion.
4471800	4476040	This is multiplied by an internal form of performative etiquette.
4476040	4479440	Participants ritualistically wish each other good morning and good night, boiled down to
4479440	4481560	the shorthand GM and GM.
4481560	4486320	That seems like a small thing, there's nothing inherently suspicious about good morning or
4486320	4490920	good night, but in observed practice it's a very distinct ritual.
4490920	4496200	Not merely a shibboleth, but a repetitive action that signals in-group membership and
4496200	4499060	affirms loyalty on an ongoing basis.
4499060	4503480	If you have diamond hands, it means you're willing to hold a token until some promised
4503480	4506080	future where the value goes to the moon.
4506080	4511180	You're not a paper hands loser who is easily spooked by instability, volatility, or the
4511180	4515240	fact that there's no reason to believe that anyone is ever going to want to buy a crypto
4515240	4516920	astronaut in the future.
4516920	4522100	The shorthand WAGMI, we're all going to make it, is aphoristically bandied about even
4522100	4528340	in openly zero-sum competitions where, by definition, most participants explicitly won't
4528340	4529340	make it.
4529340	4534060	But you can't point that out, because that would be fud, and if you're spreading fud
4534060	4540140	then your NGMI not going to make it, and making it, getting rich, is all that matters.
4540140	4543720	HFSP have fun staying poor.
4543720	4546940	These are synthesized into a no-true Scotsman paradigm.
4546940	4551600	The WE in we're all going to make it does not refer to we all.
4551600	4555940	It refers to the select, the chosen, the diamond hands, and the hodlers.
4555940	4560960	Those who make it are clearly the we, and if you didn't make it, then you weren't.
4560960	4566720	People who get angry about being scammed by a rug pole, or by malware, or by social engineering
4566720	4570160	are berated and belittled for not following the crowd.
4570160	4574900	This incubates a community trained to ignore warning signs and dismiss criticism, a community
4574900	4580880	with internal language and customs that are explicitly incompatible with outside communications.
4580880	4584920	This is fud from non-believers who are trying to undermine the value of your assets and
4584920	4588360	manipulate a crash or trick you into being a paperhands.
4588360	4594260	It all maps onto narratives of sin and deception, a chosen few who are privileged with advanced
4594260	4599060	knowledge about the promised land which they can achieve by holding strong to the rituals
4599060	4600860	and expelling all doubt.
4600860	4604860	The end product is a self-organizing high-control group.
4604860	4606880	And the results of that are obvious.
4606880	4611860	There are still people convinced that somehow, someone is going to pick up the ashes of evolved
4611860	4617380	apes and manifest the rest of the project, a belief based on no observable evidence.
4636880	4644580	So the question then is, what do the tokens actually do?
4644580	4649300	As mentioned before, the token itself is just a box that a bit of data can be put into.
4649300	4653540	Now this box is extremely small, to the point that even an average cell phone photograph
4653540	4655900	is several times too large to fit.
4655900	4660820	Due to the nature of the chain, updating software that's put onto the chain is both difficult
4660820	4662700	and expensive.
4662840	4667240	These programs need to be broken up into multiple tokens each containing a smart contract that
4667240	4671720	defines a portion of the whole, and all of these contracts need to interlink and reference
4671720	4678320	each other, but with an eye towards the fact that each transaction that either computes
4678320	4682800	or alters information requires paying processing fees.
4682800	4685560	Only reading information is free.
4685560	4690080	The process of fixing a bug in a smart contract basically amounts to minting a new copy of
4690080	4694980	the contract, and then jumping through some hoops to rename the old and new contracts
4694980	4699860	so that the new copy has the name that any other interacting contracts are looking for,
4699860	4703620	paying fees for just about every step of that process.
4703620	4708420	This creates a very funny catch 22, where on one hand is the insistence that the NFTs
4708420	4713740	that end users buy are potentially extremely powerful, able to be miniature self-governing
4713740	4719760	applets that exist in a web of like applets, and on the other hand is a large stack of
4719760	4723360	incentives to put as little into them as possible.
4723360	4727880	For an example of the pitfalls, Wolf Game was a somewhat popular NFT-based gambling
4727880	4733160	game that bragged about being hosted entirely on chain at great expense.
4733160	4737800	Everything from the pixel art wolves and sheep to the game's code was stored on Ethereum.
4737800	4742920	The idea behind the game is that users would mint a character token which had a 90% chance
4742940	4747620	of being a sheep, and a 10% chance of being a wolf, with a finite supply of wolves and
4747620	4749060	sheep available.
4749060	4754380	The important thing here is that the character tokens weren't just a bit of art and a serial
4754380	4759860	number, but tiny programs that allowed users to perform interactions like staking.
4759860	4764500	The problem is that their code was full of multiple bugs, and since some of those bugs
4764500	4773320	were contained in the character tokens, they were replicated across all 13,809 minted tokens.
4773320	4776120	A glitchy token can't be patched.
4776120	4778800	It must be replaced.
4778800	4784000	So the wolf game devs were forced to not only redeploy all their contracts, but attempt
4784000	4790280	to remint and distribute identical copies of every token generated.
4790280	4792200	It didn't go well.
4792200	4796940	Given the risks inherent in putting functionality inside the token itself, and the high cost
4796940	4802340	of interaction, the most common application is to use external systems to simply check
4802340	4804660	for possession of a token.
4804660	4810100	This is where we introduce another player into the ecosystem, wallet managers like MetaMask.
4810100	4814420	In a few short years, the system has already grown so bloated and difficult to interact
4814420	4818860	with that it's become necessary to develop middleware applications that simplify the
4818860	4823920	process of generating wallets, switching wallets, and mediating handshakes between the wallet
4823920	4825760	and external systems.
4825760	4829960	From one point of view, these wallet managers are the golden key that makes it all work.
4829960	4835240	They solve the single sign-on problem, allowing your web browser to simply know that it's
4835240	4840240	you who is using it, automatically negotiating permissions based on relevant tokens.
4840240	4844560	It's your login, your credit card, your Steam profile, and your bank account all rolled
4844560	4851780	into a single point of contact, making interaction with Web3 the internet of the future frictionless.
4851780	4856500	From another point of view, it's a massive point of failure that contains so much information,
4856500	4861100	so many permissions, so much of worth, that it becomes an extremely obvious point of attack,
4861100	4865860	manufactured by idiots who claim to be building a security product in 2021 that doesn't obfuscate
4865860	4870060	key phrases within the UI or use two-factor authentication.
4870060	4874020	Remember, again, that these people want to put medical records, driver's licenses, professional
4874020	4876720	accreditations, and real estate deeds into their system.
4876720	4878120	They should not be trusted.
4878120	4882280	The entire market is absolutely lousy with scams, and has been since Bitcoin first gained
4882280	4883560	any traction.
4883560	4888040	Every single scam structure imaginable has been dusted off and redeployed into this explicitly
4888040	4891880	unregulated market where victims are largely without recourse.
4891880	4896000	These range from institutional scams like Ponzi schemes, pump and dumps, and insider
4896000	4901200	trading, to middleweight scams like gold, brick, and wash trading, to grittier scams
4901200	4904000	like phishing and sending fake links.
4904000	4907780	Pump and dumps in particular are conducted in broad daylight, since it's not illegal,
4907780	4911620	it's just against the terms of service of the exchanges that you use to do it, so the
4911620	4914140	worst case scenario is you burn your account.
4914140	4918860	They'll straight up walk you through the process of doing a pump and dump, no code words, diagrams,
4918860	4919860	and everything.
4919860	4924660	They're notable as they're actually a two-headed scam, because you see, you might get recruited
4924660	4930580	onto the pump half of the scheme, or you might think you're being recruited to pump, but
4930580	4932460	you're actually the dump.
4932460	4936800	As already mentioned, blockchain is resilient to direct man-in-the-middle attacks, or someone
4936800	4941360	tries to inject bad data straight into the chain, but man-in-the-middle attacks are
4941360	4942360	rare.
4942360	4947080	In an environment like cryptocurrency, with few, if any, repercussions for misbehavior
4947080	4952280	that stays within the crypto sphere, man-in-the-middle attacks are wholly unnecessary.
4952280	4957320	Why try to brute force your bad data onto the chain when you can trick someone into giving
4957320	4961040	you access to their wallet, then transfer all their stuff out?
4961040	4965820	Every smart contract becomes a self-rewarding bug bounty, where the payout is whatever apes
4965820	4968780	and coins you can grab before anyone notices.
4968780	4971340	And that's not even touching on the subject of malware.
4971340	4972740	Smart contracts are just code.
4972740	4973740	They're software.
4973740	4976380	There's no reason they can't be viruses or worms.
4976380	4979220	The primary limitation is processing power.
4979220	4985460	But also, it's a virus that someone can drop directly into your bankless bank account and
4985460	4987740	just wait for you to activate it.
4987740	4989180	And yeah, that's right.
4989200	4993680	There's no offer slash confirmation step in sending tokens back and forth.
4993680	4996920	Someone who knows your wallet can just drop stuff right into it.
4996920	5000240	So like, pin that somewhere in your brain.
5000240	5004200	The best part about this is that the whole ecosystem operates on a strict assumption
5004200	5008800	that possession is ownership and access is permission.
5008800	5013000	Which is absolutely buck wild, coming from software developers claimed to be very concerned
5013000	5014240	with system security.
5014240	5018520	If someone tricks you into sending them your board ape, it's now theirs.
5018520	5022620	The only mechanism in the machine for parsing legitimate transactions from illegitimate
5022620	5026900	transactions is the consensus mechanism, which is only concerned with whether or not the
5026900	5030300	transactions followed the rules of the software.
5030300	5035580	The only illegitimacy it recognizes are people trying to insert fake data.
5035580	5040900	When you are tricked into doing something, all of the mechanics of what follows are,
5040900	5043660	by the rules of the system, legitimate.
5043660	5045140	It's a legal transfer.
5045160	5048580	More relevant, however, is the sheer density of these scams.
5048580	5053360	The one market that cryptocurrency has successfully disrupted is the market of fraud.
5053360	5057320	Think of it this way, a big population of people have willingly self-identified that
5057320	5063080	they have substantial disposable income, poor judgment, low social literacy, a high tolerance
5063080	5066640	for nonsensical risk, and are highly persuadable.
5066640	5070680	People who fall victim to these scams have basically no options other than taking to
5070680	5075620	social media and attempting to whip up enough of a frenzy that they can convince marketplaces
5075620	5080340	like OpenSea to act as de facto sensors by delisting stolen tokens.
5080340	5084980	There is no authority you can report them to that has the power to return your tokens.
5084980	5091540	The best you can hope for is denying the scammer's profit on their incredibly low-cost operation.
5091540	5096660	If your business is tricking people out of their money, you would be a fool if you didn't
5096660	5098220	take the opportunity.
5098220	5102720	Not only have participants advertised their susceptibility to incoherent promises of
5102720	5107400	future returns, the immutable structure of the chain, the persistence of data, and the
5107400	5113640	ease with which that data can be collated means that for scammers, it's extremely easy
5113640	5115320	to find marks.
5115320	5120280	Every discord for a rugpull NFT project is a roster of potential victims.
5120280	5124520	The ledger of bakeholders is a shopping list of targets.
5124520	5128740	The twitter account of anyone complaining about what they lost on evolved apes is the
5128740	5132420	low hanging fruit of a very ripe orchard.
5132420	5141300	And that's a pretty good segue into talking about privacy issues.
5141300	5145020	A low trust environment is also a low privacy environment.
5145020	5150180	Anything you do on a blockchain is, by design, accessible to everyone who knows how to navigate
5150180	5151180	the data.
5151520	5156000	You might be thinking, isn't that the opposite of how it's supposed to work?
5156000	5159080	I thought crypto was all anonymous.
5159080	5162680	So yes, crypto is anonymous by default.
5162680	5168440	There's no inherent requirement for proof of identity, and in fact numerous applications
5168440	5174160	that would benefit from a stricter one-to-one correlation between accounts and people struggle
5174160	5175160	with this.
5175160	5178080	On forums and social media, it's called sockpuppeting.
5178080	5182740	In crypto, it's called a Sibyl attack, where users are able to generate numerous alternate
5182740	5185820	identities by creating additional accounts or wallets.
5185820	5191020	The epidemic of wash trading on open sea relies on the ability to pretend you're several
5191020	5196580	different people as you buy apes from yourself for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
5196580	5199540	Rather than anonymous, this is pseudonymous.
5199540	5204220	Everyone can see what wallets and contracts your wallet interacts with based off the long
5204220	5206980	hash addresses like this.
5207000	5213120	But that hash is only implicitly connected to your identity based on circumstantial connections.
5213120	5217240	Of course, a big circumstantial connection would be something like registering with a
5217240	5221120	crypto-based social auction platform that intrinsically connects the two.
5221120	5226760	This makes it pretty easy to see that Laina Morris, overly attached girlfriend, paid $153
5226760	5232280	on March 31st to mint the overly attached girlfriend NFT, followed by a $205 reserve
5232280	5235440	on April 2nd to list the NFT on Foundation.
5235440	5240380	The Ethereum Whale, far as in far and far, then bought the token on April 3rd for $200
5240380	5245780	Ethereum, 30 of which went to Foundation with Laina getting the remaining $170, which she
5245780	5252220	transferred into USD using the exchange service Kraken in a block of $105 on April 4th and
5252220	5261740	a block of $65 on April 22nd for a combined total payout of $374,726.
5261740	5267880	After her sale, Zoe Roth transferred the Ethereum to dollars via Coinbase the next day and hasn't
5267880	5269620	touched the wallet since.
5269620	5275600	Kyle Kraven minted several other tokens, but for the most part just split the Ethereum
5275600	5281160	from the initial sale into two separate holding wallets where it's sat untouched since.
5281160	5285160	You don't need to be some super hacker to figure this stuff out, it's all publicly
5285160	5289120	available, that's the entire point of the system.
5289120	5294060	And in another feature not bug arrangement, remember, nothing can be deleted from the
5294060	5296340	blockchain without tremendous effort.
5296340	5302140	Now that's fine if the blockchain only contains a contextually relevant log of transactions,
5302140	5306620	there are absolutely contexts where that level of transparency is desirable.
5306620	5311060	But that falls apart when you start talking about using the blockchain itself as the storage
5311060	5315300	medium for, like, an entire social network.
5315300	5320520	Coinbase social network scuttlebutt seems tacitly aware that this is a bad idea, like
5320520	5325600	somewhere inside their human brains they recognize that it might be a mistake to make it impossible
5325600	5329960	to remove things from the system when they warn users that anyone willing to dig can
5329960	5336480	surface any old usernames, photos and bios, but that doesn't actually give them pause.
5336480	5342120	So if someone posts, say, child abuse imagery, revenge porn, your home address, intimate
5342120	5346020	details of your private life, there's just nothing you can really do about that.
5346020	5351300	If you mistakenly overshare, post some information that maybe you shouldn't have, it's already
5351300	5352300	too late.
5352300	5355540	You can try to hide it, but you can't delete it.
5355540	5359420	Remember that if someone knows your wallet address, they can just put tokens directly
5359420	5360420	into it.
5360420	5364780	As alluded, there's a whole scam where you drop someone at NFT that lifts the art from
5364780	5369420	who cares somewhere, but the smart contract is malicious code that drains their wallet
5369420	5374160	if they ever interact with it to move it, sell it, stake it, burn it.
5374160	5392000	It just becomes a landmine sitting in their wallet forever.
5392000	5396120	Even on the non-malware side of things, people have already been using this to dump promotional
5396120	5400800	tokens into the wallets of celebrities and influencers, but, you know, dick pics are
5400800	5403260	an any second now kind of thing, right?
5403260	5408240	Oh look, I minted a photo of your front door and dropped it directly into your wallet.
5408240	5412120	And you can't just, like, delete it, you need to actively send it somewhere and pay
5412120	5414700	gas fees to do so.
5414700	5416420	Revolutionary new vectors and harassment.
5416420	5421120	The end product here is a massive power imbalance that's baked into the fabric of how you engage
5421120	5423100	with this new world order.
5423100	5427600	Users who engage with the system authentically as themselves expose vast swaths of information
5427600	5432320	about themselves and their activities, while users who engage disingenuously are empowered
5432320	5435240	in their ability to deceive, defraud, and disappear.
5435240	5439000	A lot of this rhetoric stems from a pretty deep failure to understand what a central
5439000	5444520	authority really is, or that you can decentralize data storage while centralizing data.
5444520	5449000	Ethereum is ultimately a central platform, and the fact that a few dozen people need
5449000	5453220	to sign off on every major change before it can be implemented is largely meaningless
5453220	5458020	and symbolic, with the validation network ultimately sitting somewhere between consortium
5458020	5459300	and cartel.
5459300	5464260	Every large platform has multiple internal and external stakeholders that form a consensus
5464260	5466100	about the direction of the platform.
5466100	5468820	Windows is not a single-minded monolith.
5468820	5471020	Apple issues voting shares.
5471020	5473620	Google is basically a hydra.
5473620	5479480	While the network of Ethereum miners and validators are not a formal corporation, yet, there's
5479480	5483960	no mechanism in existence that compels them to act in the interest of users, particularly
5483960	5488600	poor and disempowered users where those interests conflict with their own.
5488600	5493360	The movement of Ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake has been vaporware in no
5493360	5497920	small part because the validators simply choose not to.
5497920	5502440	Because proof of work, volatility, and high gas fees benefit them in the here and now,
5502460	5507300	proof of stake, and low gas fees only benefit them in a hypothetical future.
5507300	5511980	Because these extremely obvious pitfalls are what you get when you let guys like Vitalik
5511980	5515220	Buterin and Elon Musk design the future.
5515220	5519700	The sole protection for users of Ethereum is that the system is so cumbersome that all
5519700	5522700	but the most egregious breaches aren't worth addressing.
5522700	5527300	Of course, that in truth means that only the wealthy have access to justice within the
5527300	5528300	system.
5528360	5532640	Take all these different things, all these parts of your identity, all your economic
5532640	5537360	activity, all the video games you play, all the groups you join, and stick them into one
5537360	5539840	system, that's a central system.
5539840	5544260	It doesn't matter how many different servers that system spans, or how many validators
5544260	5550400	need to agree before changes can be made, you've pooled all that data in one place.
5550400	5556760	The proposed Web3 crypto driven future of the internet is a privacy disaster.
5556760	5559700	This is why I find MetaMask horrifying as a product.
5559700	5563940	It's a bucket that's asking you to pour unfathomable amounts of data and permissions
5563940	5564940	into it.
5564940	5568460	It's such a tremendous and monumental point of failure.
5568460	5572620	And this is where NFTs really bloom into their final form.
5577460	5583980	The primary use case of tokens beyond speculation ultimately is to function as access passes.
5583980	5587640	From a web engineering perspective, imagine tokens that are the mother of all cookies
5587640	5593040	and consider a tracking token that users don't just willingly associate themselves with,
5593040	5597860	but enthusiastically drag with them from device to device ensuring a continuity of
5597860	5600720	tracking across all web activity.
5600720	5605600	The future version of the web, built on the back of cryptocurrency and mediated by financialized
5605600	5607600	tokens, is a dystopia.
5607600	5611320	It's a technology that's built to turn everything into money, to treat every corner
5611320	5615980	of our social existence as a marketplace, to attach an abstract, representative token
5615980	5619060	to everything from video games to labor unions.
5619060	5623500	Proponents of Web3 will disagree with this assessment, particularly the claim that cryptocurrency
5623500	5630740	is endemic to Web3 and the two are intractable, but that's the practical reality of the situation.
5630740	5634860	Every substantial project branding itself under the banner of Web3 is strapped to the
5634860	5639300	side of a blockchain, be it issuing governance tokens or relying on the chain's smart
5639300	5643680	contract layer, or requiring possession of a cryptocurrency in order to pay the processing
5643680	5646280	fees that are mandatory in order to participate.
5646280	5650600	They are at this point philosophically and technologically entwined.
5650600	5655680	Less accessible, less free, less interesting, and substantially more expensive, Web3 is
5655680	5661560	the vanguard of a million paywalls and oppressive, code-enforced DRM schemes sold to idealists
5661560	5665680	as a decentralized system where they, and not wealthy stakeholders, have the power.
5665680	5669860	I see tremendous blind spots in a community that has spent so long focusing on the hype
5669860	5674660	of an untenable fantasy metaverse where they're the ones cowing corporations with immutable
5674660	5679460	ownership guaranteeing their ability to resell video game horse armor that they failed to
5679460	5685620	consider that the enforcement of ownership can and will be used against them if and when
5685620	5688940	corporations decide to leverage their power in the space.
5688940	5692820	The fantasy amongst evangelists is that a tokenized economy where digital goods are
5692820	5696160	mediated by NFTs would give them more power.
5696160	5700800	Goods like digital games would have true ownership encapsulated in the ability to be resold,
5700800	5704640	but there is no reason to believe that this is how things would shake out.
5704640	5709800	The far, far more probable result is that the tokens are used to lock products down
5709800	5711040	even tighter.
5711040	5713960	The Squid Game Token scam is illustrative here.
5713960	5718720	In early November 2021, a new meme token popped up styled after the hit Netflix show
5718720	5719940	Squid Game.
5719940	5723500	Over the course of about a week, the price of the token was pumped from a few cents
5723500	5731100	to just under $3,000 U.S. Estimates are that the Squid developers took in about $3.38 million
5731100	5735500	before cashing out their holdings, deleting their socials, and vanishing into thin air.
5735500	5742340	A classic rug pull, but the truly transcendental detail is that it left buyers with not merely
5742340	5746460	a useless token, but a token that couldn't be sold at all.
5746460	5751760	Built into Squid was a requirement that in order to transfer or sell the tokens, a corresponding
5751760	5756560	number of marbles tokens needed to be spent at the same time.
5756560	5759320	The hitch was that marbles were never available.
5759320	5764760	No rules were broken in this scam, and indeed the Squid tokens do exactly what they say
5764760	5765760	they do.
5765760	5771200	If you have the appropriate amount of marbles tokens, you can absolutely transfer or sell
5771200	5773000	your squid.
5773000	5774400	Just good luck getting any.
5774400	5780420	A game developer can in any of myriad ways deliver on a truly owned digital token that
5780420	5785940	is rendered untradable in practice and all by playing by the rules.
5785940	5789660	Rules must always be evaluated for their power to oppress.
5789660	5793300	This is a blind spot to crypto enthusiasts because they just assume that they're the
5793300	5797020	early adopters, they're the ones who will have power, they're the ones who will get
5797020	5800900	to set the rules, and they're the ones who will do the oppressing.
5800900	5805320	Remember that any token that can be used to grant access can also be used to revoke
5805320	5806320	it.
5806320	5810380	Like, let's say that I create a hangout spot in one of the metaverse contender platforms
5810380	5814480	Decentraland and we call it the Ahigao alpaca oasis.
5814480	5819120	The oasis has a back room that only allows registered players to enter, meaning you need
5819120	5823440	to have your meta mask linked to Decentraland in order to get in.
5823440	5828800	This type of gate is typically used to create VIP areas, places where only people who hold
5828800	5832460	a specific token or class of token can enter.
5832460	5836740	Only people with official Ahigao alpacas can enter.
5836740	5841940	But as is well known within the lore of the metaverse, the Ahigao alpacas have long been
5841940	5847380	at war with the board-ape yacht club, so rather than checking for an alpaca token, I check
5847380	5850420	for ape tokens and then forbid entrance.
5850420	5855580	Or maybe I just make my game artificially more difficult for them, or inflate my prices.
5855580	5860280	Now imagine that instead of running a hangout spot in a video game, that I'm a decentralized
5860280	5864720	finance organization giving out mortgages in cryptocurrency and I scour your transaction
5864720	5869520	history for donations to the NAACP as part of my risk assessment protocol.
5869520	5873640	Imagine that Nestle is able to track unionization efforts in real time because the union is
5873640	5876920	issuing governance tokens on a publicly auditable blockchain.
5876920	5882040	The belief that the world will be fairer if the rules are enshrined in code enforced by
5882040	5887900	computers and made extremely difficult to change or circumvent is laughable.
5887900	5891460	It's not merely naive, but categorically ahistoric.
5891460	5893740	This is where a lot of my resistance comes from.
5893740	5898500	You can create specialized crypto chains that have a negligible environmental impact, but
5898500	5901980	the force of that model is culturally destructive.
5901980	5906240	The current system sucks, but this is just a worse version of the current system.
5906240	5907660	It doesn't even stop there.
5907660	5909460	It's tokens all the way down.
5909460	5914880	This game has a good high barrier of entry, so most people can't do it unless they have
5914880	5918280	what's called a scholarship where someone essentially pays for their barrier of entry
5918280	5922040	to allow them to play the game and then they can split the profits afterwards.
5922040	5927520	Like okay, Axie Infinity is a so-called play-to-earn video game based on Ethereum, but because
5927520	5932920	Ethereum is too slow and expensive to interact with directly, the developers SkyMavis created
5932920	5938160	a side chain called Ronin, which consists of a governance currency called AXS.
5938160	5943180	The game character tokens called Axies and the in-game currency called Smooth Love Potions
5943180	5944540	or SLP.
5944540	5948340	All of these components are built to function as money because that's what the machine
5948340	5949460	is built to do.
5949460	5954380	The so-called play-to-earn model is a great case study in what the end result of the crypto
5954380	5956700	econ system actually looks like.
5956700	5960620	Axie Infinity gets a lot of credulous coverage from the press because a handful of people
5960620	5964900	in the Philippines are able to make a marginal living by playing the game and flipping their
5964900	5970160	SLP, which lets SkyMaven turn around and pretend that they're a humanitarian organization
5970160	5974320	and not a for-profit business who makes money off all the people rushing to buy a team of
5974320	5976960	Axies believing that they can get paid just for playing.
5976960	5981800	Now real quick, Axie Infinity is a lightweight card-based PVP game where players fight with
5981800	5984000	a team of three critters called Axies.
5984000	5987000	It's a bit Pokemon and a bit Slay the Spire.
5987000	5990920	Axies have randomized attributes and are all tokenized, so if you sell an Axie, you're
5990920	5993520	selling that specific Axie.
5993520	5997380	The loved potions are used to breed Axies and thus form the basis of the economy as
5997380	6001180	they are fungible relative to the Axies themselves.
6001180	6005020	Matches are either ranked or unranked, but only ranked matches entered using energy which
6005020	6007780	recharges every day can earn SLP.
6007780	6011700	The amount of energy you have to work with depends on the number of Axies in your wallet
6011700	6014060	and ranges from 20 to 60.
6014060	6017940	Additionally, higher ranked matches are worth more SLP.
6017940	6022660	More SLP means a bigger stable of Axies, which means more energy to play matches, more flexibility
6022680	6027560	within the metagame, better team compositions, and baseline better stats enabling easier
6027560	6028560	wins.
6028560	6033040	So the difference in earning potential between higher and lower ranked accounts is pretty
6033040	6034560	substantial.
6034560	6038520	What coverage tends to note and then quickly move on from is the fact that the game is
6038520	6043480	extremely expensive to onboard, costing hundreds of dollars to assemble a basic team, which
6043480	6048240	has led to the rise of what are euphemistically called scholarship programs.
6048240	6052580	Players like whale scholars that set up a large number of accounts give players access
6052580	6058020	to the game account, but not the underlying wallet, and then pay players a split of the
6058020	6060380	SLP the account generates.
6060380	6065100	Whale scholars and other mentorship businesses retain full control of the wallet, and thus
6065100	6068900	the Axies, the SLP, and any AXS.
6068900	6071380	It's capitalism in its rawest form.
6071380	6076660	Players invest their time into grinding SLP, and then the owners take half the returns.
6076680	6081640	Players get to barely make minimum wage, while the owners, who are taking 50% from dozens,
6081640	6085560	if not hundreds of players, get to speculate on digital land.
6085560	6089640	Look what the whale scholars just got.
6089640	6094400	We have land in the Arctic, baby.
6094400	6097520	We have Arctic land.
6097520	6102320	Axies energy system is fundamentally broken in how it promotes this exact middleman arrangement.
6102320	6106760	If you have 21 Axies in your wallet, you can create one account that has 60 Energy
6106760	6112460	at its disposal, or you can create 7 bare minimum accounts with 20 Energy each.
6112460	6117700	A high ranked account with 60 Energy will dramatically outperform a single low ranked
6117700	6123580	account with 20 Energy, but 7 accounts that are played daily by other people is far and
6123580	6129580	away the best ROI because it involves doing basically nothing except collecting your cut.
6129580	6134360	And more illustrative, between August and October 2021, the internal economy of Axie
6134360	6135840	Infinity crashed.
6135840	6140320	Not absolute rock bottom, but bad enough that all but the highest ranking players fell
6140320	6145960	below the average daily wage in the Philippines, with low ranked players falling below minimum
6145960	6146960	wage.
6146960	6150880	Navik, a think tank and consulting firm that does deep research on game economies, has
6150880	6155320	done a pretty deep and thorough analysis of the Axie economy, and in their write up they
6155320	6158600	identify the core sources psychological.
6158600	6163100	Players aren't playing to play the game, they're playing to make money, they treat
6163100	6168460	the game as a job, and thus have little interest in the game items for their own sake.
6168460	6173980	Once they have enough stuff to cover their job, they stop reinvesting and start cashing
6173980	6174980	out.
6174980	6179060	The price of low quality Axies, the ones that new players are likely to buy in order to
6179060	6184900	onboard for the lowest cost possible, is propped up entirely by players buying them roughly
6184900	6187180	at the same rate they're generated.
6187180	6191720	This requires either mentors to be scaling up their teams by buying Axies instead of
6191720	6197440	generating them, or new players injecting new money into the ecosystem by onboarding.
6197440	6201960	But the more players that are playing, the more SLP and Axies that will be generated,
6201960	6206600	thus the fundamentally unsustainable economic model where an infinite supply of new players
6206600	6210920	must enter the ecosystem forever purely to keep the price stable.
6210920	6216560	If it tips one way or the other, you either get runaway inflation or runaway deflation.
6216580	6219060	This happens all the time in games.
6219060	6222060	Games bork their internal economy constantly.
6222060	6226340	It just doesn't normally matter because you're talking about completely fictional gold or
6226340	6228420	gems or dragon bones.
6228420	6234340	A truly stable economy isn't even desirable from a gameplay standpoint anyway.
6234340	6238980	Gentle inflation ends up helping newer and more casual players by driving down the cost
6238980	6244300	of things in the in-game economy which lets those players participate and have fun.
6244360	6249880	Of course if your pitch is play to earn and not play to have fun, where the optics of
6249880	6254240	buoying up the ficative valuation of your company rest entirely on the assumption that
6254240	6259060	players can earn, then that's of a bit of a different incentive set, isn't it?
6259060	6262920	More people play Axie Infinity to try and make money than play it because it's a game
6262920	6264040	they enjoy.
6264040	6266520	This is a fundamental flaw in the model.
6266520	6270680	If you pitch your game based on earning potential, you are going to attract people seeking to
6270700	6276780	industrialize your platform faster and in greater numbers than would otherwise play.
6276780	6282020	This is exactly the parasitic situation that games for decades now have been actively minimizing
6282020	6285140	because it creates vicious negative externalities.
6285140	6289060	If players can sell their in-game stuff, then it changes the way they play the game.
6289060	6293100	It changes the way they optimize their playtime.
6293100	6297780	Since the vast majority of games are openly a non-investment, a straight exchange of money
6297840	6302960	for entertainment, also known as a purchase, players tend to optimize their playtime for
6302960	6309400	intangible returns like fun, distraction, socialization, relaxation, challenge, achievement, and narrative
6309400	6313720	fulfillment with absolutely no expectation that the money and time they put in should
6313720	6316760	return anything other than those things.
6316760	6320800	The key shift here and the meaningless buzz phrase that you'll encounter online is the
6320800	6325640	proposition that the results of playing a game should retain value, which is code for
6325660	6328660	having a potentially speculative price.
6328660	6333060	In order to try and keep the grift mill running for another few months, Sky Maven have tweaked
6333060	6336860	the economy to reduce the amount of SLP players can earn per hour.
6336860	6342620	It's a nightmarishly thin edge to be walking on, and the main thing it has managed to accomplish
6342620	6347740	is enabling an entire strata of pit bosses running teams of players grinding out smooth
6347740	6349380	love potions.
6349380	6354020	And like all bosses, they have not taken the downturn in stride and have instead started
6354020	6355020	cracking the whip.
6355400	6358280	We do not accept mediocre gaming anymore.
6358280	6364560	Need at least 120 to 150 SLP a day, and those who yield more will be rewarded with additional
6364560	6365880	percentage.
6365880	6368680	I prioritize those who have gaming experience.
6368680	6371160	We have a separate program for charity.
6371160	6374480	Evangelists like to point to this as though it's inspiring.
6374480	6378640	People in economically disempowered countries able to make a meager living by simply playing
6378640	6379640	a video game.
6379640	6381320	I reject that framing.
6381320	6382320	It's horrifying.
6382320	6385780	Our global system is so fundamentally unjust that people are patting themselves on the
6385780	6390460	back for generating a whole new kind of online UwU pit boss who tells you to grind harder
6390460	6393700	or you're fired but caps it off with a blushy emoji.
6393700	6394700	Oopsie.
6394700	6398080	Looks like someone didn't meet their quota.
6398080	6399080	This sucks.
6407080	6411220	I think the thing that normies don't get about NFT bros is their dedication.
6411220	6416300	The staggering volume of capital they already control, and how deeply rooted they are in
6416300	6421380	the culture of the people who operate the platforms we all use every day, and that alone
6421380	6423860	is a good reason for people to pay attention.
6423860	6429140	They have a lot of money and a lot of clout that they can use to try and make fetch happen.
6429140	6431460	This is something of a splitting point.
6431460	6434940	Basically, the future shakes out in one of two broad ways.
6434940	6439540	One is that some new technological buzzword comes along and blockchain and web3 lose their
6439540	6444500	sway over investors, the stream of new buyers dries up, and the early investors cash out
6444500	6447020	as best they can, popping the whole bubble.
6447020	6451060	The other is that they're successful, and cryptocurrency is able to crowbar its way
6451060	6453940	into enough corners of our lives that it becomes unavoidable.
6453940	6458980	We're all forced in some way to maintain a crypto wallet to manage whatever coins and
6458980	6463940	tokens become necessary for participation in society, providing early investors with
6463940	6466700	a captive audience and steady flow of capital.
6466700	6471460	To quote German sociotechnologist Jürgen Guter, better known by his online alias Tante,
6471460	6476140	there are parts of your digital life that currently you can't really sell, but that's
6476140	6478220	what they want to change.
6478220	6480280	Everything needs to be bought and sold.
6480280	6482700	Everything is just a vehicle for more speculation.
6482700	6487380	The reason they want you to be able to resell your access token to some service instead
6487380	6492700	of buying or renting it like today is to create even more markets for speculation and the smart
6492700	6497020	contracts can be set up in a way that at every corner they profit.
6497020	6501140	The claims that this technology facilitates an immutable ledger of ownership is itself
6501140	6505460	largely hollow posturing even from within the ecosystem.
6505460	6510540	Remember that most of the actual things being referenced are not contained within the chains
6510540	6515060	themselves because the chains are too slow, restrictive, and bad at their job to actually
6515060	6520580	store media, and because many of the things being sold are purely ephemeral.
6520580	6525740	The IPFS address for any given media token can be effortlessly minted onto another competing
6525740	6528100	chain or even the same chain.
6528100	6532280	That's not even right-click saving, that's referencing the exact same media.
6532280	6538100	Why is the token on Ethereum more authoritative than the token on Tezos or Cardano or Solano
6538100	6544260	or Ergo or Silo or Binance or Algorand or Polkadot or EOS or Tron or VeChain or Ethereum
6544260	6549220	Classic or Phantom or Stellar or Stacks or Neo or Waves or Hollow or Link or Radix or
6549220	6554260	Harmony or Oasis or Icon or Secret or Iota or Crown or Terra or Omni or Enigma or Elastos
6554260	6556500	or Edgeware or Bitom or Fuse or Gather?
6556500	6561500	If a chain hard forks, which version of your stuff is the real one?
6561500	6567900	Bitcoin is itself mired in a turf war between Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin SV.
6567900	6572740	The myth of immutable ownership governed by these systems is predicated on a monolithic
6572740	6573740	victor.
6573740	6579220	In reality, your NFTs within the Ethereum ecosystem are ultimately just as trapped,
6579220	6582780	sandboxed, and meaningless as your Steam trading cards.
6582780	6587260	You'll hear about protocols like Polygon that aim to let you move stuff from chain
6587260	6589580	to chain, but that's sleight of hand.
6589580	6594140	You can't remove something from a chain, so all they really do is create a new token
6594140	6599100	at the destination and add a note to the bottom of the original token that says, I'm currently
6599100	6601540	somewhere else, please don't move or sell me.
6601820	6606220	It's an ask that's governed by smart contracts so vulnerable to bad coding.
6606220	6611100	In video game terms, they would be immediately hammered looking for item duplication glitches,
6611100	6615460	a vulnerability that's basically inevitable in a mass adoption scenario.
6615460	6620900	It's a system that is at once impenetrable and brittle, and that arrangement disproportionately
6620900	6622940	empowers the dishonest.
6622940	6627040	One of the complications is that it's basically impossible to extricate the digital scarcity
6627040	6631760	concepts of NFTs from cryptocurrency and the core philosophies that cryptocurrency
6631760	6633120	was built from.
6633120	6637000	One rose out of the other and they are basically forever entwined.
6637000	6641520	One of the ironies of all this is that any legitimate artistic or anti-capitalist uses
6641520	6646540	of the underlying technology are contingent on the tech remaining niche.
6646540	6651920	On a very basic level, the systems just suck, being slow, difficult to use, and generally
6651920	6652920	oblique.
6652920	6656480	For the most part, to the degree that they're usable at all, it is largely at the mercy
6656920	6658600	of only having a few users.
6658600	6663040	There are blockchains that are reasonably responsive and reasonably cheap because they're not
6663040	6664040	popular.
6664040	6668760	Hickhead Nunes is a well-regarded art market on the Tezos blockchain, transaction fees
6668760	6673200	and deflation are at the moment relatively minimal, and thus a lot of the transactions
6673200	6676560	are able to operate in the range of $5 to $20.
6676560	6682160	But that state exists by the grace of being 45th in popularity, just high enough to actually
6682160	6686240	have users, but not high enough to have attracted too many bots.
6686240	6690600	If Tezos goes, as they say, to the moon, then that all changes.
6690600	6694320	Users adopt the platform, disproportionate to the scale of validators, the value of
6694320	6698360	Tez skyrockets, and the actual marketplace of people using Hickhead Nunes experience
6698360	6703040	hyper-deflation, where hoarders are rewarded handsomely and buyers are punished.
6703040	6708320	Okay, we need to pause here for a moment because this is actually really important, but absurdly
6708320	6713040	complex like textbook, length, subject matter, so here's the short version.
6713040	6716680	One is counterintuitive because the line is going up, which makes it look like a good
6716680	6720240	thing, but it's only good if you already have the currency in hand.
6720240	6724800	As the purchasing power of a currency increases, typically because cash gets more scarce, the
6724800	6726880	cost of goods and labor goes down.
6726880	6731160	A deflationary economy punishes buying things as anything that you buy today will inevitably
6731160	6732880	be cheaper to buy in the future.
6732880	6738040	If you need to buy things that aren't financial assets, things that don't appreciate in value,
6738040	6742460	like food, clothing, rent, vehicles, transit fare, you screw yourself over.
6742460	6747780	This is hyper-deflation, and it's not only designed into cryptocurrencies with their
6747780	6753120	hard cap on total coin supply, but considered desirable by their creators.
6753120	6757240	This is what going to the moon means.
6757240	6759260	Now let's talk about unions.
6759260	6763740	Using tokens to verify union membership and participate in union activities relies on
6763740	6768500	the tech being oblique enough that union busters and their clients don't see it as a meaningful
6768500	6770280	arena to monitor.
6770280	6776260	Although that ship has already sailed, union busters and gig economy evangelists love crypto.
6776260	6780440	They love DeFi and they love smart contracts, and they love NFTs.
6780440	6781640	And why wouldn't they?
6781640	6785440	It's an environment that demolishes consumer protections and transfers tremendous amounts
6785440	6787620	of explicit power to the wealthy.
6787620	6791680	In a lot of ways this is all just a system for deferring trust onto machines and pretending
6791680	6795720	that there aren't humans on the other end, and if there's one thing that union busters
6795720	6801520	love it's the prospect of an unbreakable individual contract whose inequities can all
6801520	6803420	be blamed on a machine.
6803420	6807540	The current state of the web, concentrated in a few mega-platforms, is the result of
6807540	6809600	compounding complexity.
6809600	6815000	We used to have a web where anyone could learn to write a web page in html in an afternoon.
6815000	6818960	It's just writing text and then using tags to format the text.
6818960	6823920	But over time, people, understandably, wanted the web to do more, to look better, and so
6823920	6829560	the things that were possible expanded via scripting languages that allowed for dynamic,
6829560	6830880	interactive content.
6830880	6836040	Soon, the definition of what a website was and looked like sailed out of reach of casual
6836040	6840960	users and eventually even out of reach of all but the most dedicated hobbyists.
6840960	6847720	It became the domain of specialists, so casual users, excluded by complexity, moved to templates,
6847720	6849600	services, and platforms.
6849600	6854880	This process gradually concentrated a critical mass of users into a handful of social media
6854880	6855880	platforms.
6855880	6859600	Already, even within the space, new hegemons are forming.
6859600	6864000	Tremendous amounts of capital and power are concentrating in corporations like Consensus,
6864000	6869160	who own MetaMask and Anamoka Brands, who have wide and deep investment in crypto gaming.
6869160	6874080	OpenSea, the at-present dominant marketplace for tokens on a couple different chains, is
6874080	6876840	filling the power roles users need.
6876840	6880680	While the chain itself is, in theory, the arbiter of truth, nothing prevents people
6880680	6886520	from filling the chain with lies, and so arises a demand for not merely a chain parser, a
6886520	6892520	service that enables users to interact with the chain, but an interpreter of the chain.
6892520	6897120	Motivational Speaker and DZMark Calvin Bekerra claimed to have lost three board-ape yacht
6897120	6900000	club tokens to a social engineering scam.
6900000	6904160	In reaction to this, he took to Twitter to whip up a mob that could pressure OpenSea
6904160	6908640	and two other marketplaces into flagging the tokens as stolen, and blocking them from
6908640	6909640	being sold.
6909640	6914600	Calvin was eventually able to re-secure his tokens by paying a ransom, because that's
6914600	6918320	really all you can do, and he doesn't seem to consider that from the perspective of
6918320	6921840	the thieves, that's an entirely desirable outcome.
6921840	6922840	They won.
6922840	6924160	Their plan worked.
6924160	6926400	This happens all the time.
6926400	6930440	Board-ape members are particularly susceptible targets of fraud, owing to their specific
6930440	6933680	combination of greed and low social literacy.
6933840	6937680	According to avoid paying platform fees and royalties, many of them moved off OpenSea
6937680	6942400	to doing transactions on a shady little platform called NFT Trader, which allowed scammers
6942400	6947320	to run a very simple link swap scam and steal at least a dozen different eight tokens in
6947320	6948840	the span of a couple days.
6948840	6952640	The meat of Calvin's incident is the way in which the platforms that interact with
6952640	6958600	the chain are being deputized by users to be the de facto authority, not on what the
6958600	6963120	chain says, but what the chain means.
6963120	6968000	It is just a re-creation of existing power structures within the new environment.
6975320	6980600	Now this is where evangelists insist that the answer lies in dows, decentralized autonomous
6980600	6986560	organizations, a revolutionary new way to organize people that will allow for the decentralized
6986560	6988520	governance of these systems.
6988520	6993520	So that's the claim, but what is it exactly once you strip off the paint?
6993520	6998080	A DAO is an organization whose membership, roles, and privileges are governed by possession
6998080	7003080	of relevant tokens on a given blockchain, and it's also the underlying software that
7003080	7005120	executes relevant operations.
7005120	7007400	That's kind of really about it.
7007400	7012560	So just to be very clear here, a conceptual DAO consists of three things.
7012560	7018480	People, a digital machine built of smart contracts, and a token that allows the people to interact
7018680	7020440	with the machine.
7020440	7026640	In practice, most things that call themselves DAOs don't have the machine at all, and a
7026640	7032200	substantial number either don't have the token, or only have the token.
7032200	7038680	The upside of a DAO is that it makes it easy-ish to create a formal organization at theoretically
7038680	7043400	any scale, from only a couple people to a massive pool of stakeholders, and the program
7043400	7047480	layer makes it possible to automate certain activities and the results.
7047480	7052160	If the organization votes via the DAO interface, the results of that vote are automatically
7052160	7054960	recorded and potentially executed.
7054960	7058040	Though that framing is misleading.
7058040	7062600	As with tokens themselves, there's no inherent functionality in a DAO, it's just a box that
7062600	7063600	code goes into.
7063600	7067840	I might as well be referring to all the things you could do with a web page.
7067840	7072840	As already mentioned, many organizations presenting themselves as a DAO have no machine functionality
7072840	7073840	at all.
7073880	7077680	Every standard to find a DAO that has issued a governance token, the script that's used
7077680	7082960	for voting, with the systems to actually use that token being placed somewhere in the
7082960	7085360	nebulous future of the roadmap.
7085360	7089480	That open-endedness is actually important because while the claim is that these machines will
7089480	7095000	further democratize the internet, the technical complexity that they add, the new specialized
7095000	7099400	programming expertise that they require, concentrates a lot of power in the hands of
7099400	7104080	people who can build the templates that in turn enable non-programmers to actually use
7104080	7105080	it.
7105080	7108680	It's just laying the seeds for the future recreation of the status quo.
7108680	7113880	The Facebook, Google, Amazon dominated internet arose because the technical cost of building
7113880	7118600	a modern website rose far beyond what the vast majority of amateurs could manage.
7118600	7122760	So everyone moved to templates and then to services and finally to platforms.
7122760	7125800	This doesn't even reset the clock on that.
7125800	7131440	The technical cost of creating a DAO is already far beyond any casual amateur, in part because
7131440	7135680	all of this is being built by programmers and in part because of the stakes.
7135680	7139840	The only thing this stuff is truly good for is managing on-chain assets.
7139840	7144800	A DAO program can see the state of the chain and interact with it so the DAO humans can
7144800	7149120	vote on what should happen to those assets and then the DAO program can automatically
7149120	7150520	act on the results.
7150520	7155120	But that raises the stakes, because a DAO can see and interact directly with on-chain
7155120	7160840	assets, there's the risk that via bad programming or unforeseen exploits a malicious actor can
7160840	7163920	use a DAO to access all kinds of stuff.
7163920	7169360	The risk is directly proportional to the value of the assets kept on-chain, and remember
7169360	7173560	again that evangelists want to put everything on-chain.
7173560	7177240	The hilarious thing is that this has already played out once before.
7177240	7182400	In fact it played out with the first DAO ever built, called the DAO.
7182400	7187160	This whole story unfolds over the course of three months in 2016, from April to June.
7187160	7192520	The DAO was an Ethereum-based venture capital fund that aimed to use code to create an investment
7192520	7197400	firm without a conventional management structure or board of directors, a scheme that's positioned
7197400	7202320	as lightweight and reducing bureaucratic overhead, but really it just translated to an attempt
7202320	7206320	at minimizing human liability for the actions and behaviors of the fund.
7206320	7210280	This unparalleled expression of greed made the major speculative players in Ethereum
7210320	7216420	so horny that during the April and May pre-sale, they funneled 14% of the entire volume of
7216420	7219040	Ether into the DAO's central wallet.
7219040	7223360	Now, because the DAO's underlying code was open source, experts and malicious actors
7223360	7228640	alike were able to pour over it for vulnerabilities, and indeed, vulnerabilities were found.
7228640	7233280	However, because at the end of the day, fleshy humans are the ones actually pushing buttons
7233280	7238000	and making decisions, the actual leadership of the nominally leaderless DAO, horny for
7238040	7241600	money and prestige, decided to launch in late May anyway.
7241600	7245160	Three weeks later, the DAO's programming was exploited and the attacker was able to
7245160	7251440	transfer one third of the DAO's funds into a holding wallet, about 5% of the entire Ethereum
7251440	7255840	economy valued at the time around $16-17 million.
7255840	7260360	Now, because this threatened the bottom line of capital holders, the Ethereum project as
7260360	7265480	a whole, the entire thing, was almost immediately forked in order to undo the hack and protect
7265480	7267280	the interests of the wealthy.
7267280	7271480	In classic, the arm of the fork that didn't undo the attack persists to this day, though
7271480	7275500	it's notably less popular despite being demonstrably more principled.
7275500	7279000	Because all the talk about decentralization is a myth, it's just words.
7279000	7282560	At the end of the day, the guys in charge, the guys who built the system to serve their
7282560	7286240	interests, are still in charge and keep a kill switch in their back pocket.
7286240	7292200	Crypto is barely a decade old and organizations deemed too big to fail already exist.
7292200	7297120	The whole fiasco laid out the truth from the word go, calling a DAO a revolutionary structure
7297120	7298560	is smoke and mirrors.
7298560	7300120	It's just voting shares.
7300120	7304120	You might as well call Apple a bold experiment in democracy because a baker's judge and
7304120	7307000	individuals make the decisions instead of just one.
7307000	7310920	Regardless of the future pitfalls, DAOs are also extremely limited.
7310920	7312800	They are, again, just code.
7312800	7317120	Well, evangelists promise that they can reinvent the social organization, mentally consider
7317120	7321960	all the problems, conflicts, and decision making that social organizations deal with,
7321960	7326840	and ask how many of those even can be solved by code.
7326840	7331840	Some of them can easily be turned into computer programs, automated bookkeeping, payouts,
7331840	7336280	collections, data tracking, sure, that's all stuff organizations conceptually can make
7336280	7337400	use of.
7337400	7342120	But how do you code for the fact that red just really doesn't get along with blue?
7342120	7347480	The pitch promises organizations bound by unbreakable rules, but how many organizations
7347480	7350720	actually benefit from that level of rigidity?
7350720	7356080	In particular, what happens when the version of the rules enforced by code run up against
7356080	7359160	a complication that the coders didn't consider?
7359160	7363080	What happens if someone with legitimate stake in the DAO starts spamming the organization's
7363080	7365320	internal systems with bad requests?
7365320	7367740	What if not enough people participate in voting?
7367740	7369920	What if the system locks itself up?
7369920	7371720	What if the rules are rigged?
7371720	7374580	What if the system commits a crime?
7374580	7378920	If this technology did see mass adoption, a future time bomb already exists in the fact
7378920	7384080	that very, very few of these systems have factored mortality into the considerations of their
7384080	7389400	future, because what if someone with an important token dies is a really easy thing to overlook
7389400	7393960	when you're kind of insulated tech bro who reinvents vending machines and calls them bodega
7393960	7394960	boxes.
7394960	7397960	Now all of these hypotheticals are technically addressable.
7397960	7403200	You can build contingency systems that can account for them, but then you need to consider
7403200	7408200	contingencies for those contingencies, because what if someone uses systems intended for
7408200	7412760	dealing with deceased or absentee members to expel people they just don't like?
7412760	7417640	And again, you can only use code to enforce interactions that the programmers make enforceable
7417640	7419280	via the code.
7419280	7422920	Constitution DAO, a hastily set up scheme to bid on one of the few remaining original
7422920	7427320	copies of the US Constitution, already ran aground most of these problems as the project
7427320	7432000	failed to win the auction and is now trying to issue refunds, a thing that the slap-dash
7432000	7434680	machine was never intended to do.
7434680	7439960	The reality is that most organizations with any meaningful social complexity, even tiny
7439960	7445680	organizations like Video Game Guilds, are too complex to properly express in code.
7445680	7450200	There's too many contingencies and contingencies for those contingencies and contingencies
7450200	7452800	for those contingencies to account for.
7452800	7458240	So rather than trying to turn social interactions into code, the DAO is marginalized into only
7458240	7463880	handling code-appropriate tasks like bookkeeping, digital signature verification, and on-chain
7463880	7464880	asset management.
7464880	7468760	But that's not a revolutionary new way to organize people.
7468760	7470720	That's just a productivity tool.
7470720	7475080	The DAO can have a process for voting on actions, but the moment the outcome of those actions
7475080	7480280	move off-chain, i.e. into the real world, the DAO program is powerless.
7480280	7484000	The program can't make humans execute the decisions of the group.
7484000	7486120	That's still an analog problem.
7486120	7490480	The whole thing very quickly runs into an incentive wall, where it's just faster and
7490480	7497000	easier to solve problems verbally via abstract trust relationships and promises, to the same
7497000	7498240	end results.
7498240	7502760	This is why it's so common for DAOs to not actually have any of the inner machine that
7502760	7505760	would actually make them into what they claim to be.
7505760	7507560	It's easier to just not.
7507560	7511440	Taken as a whole, DAOs aren't some revolutionary new model, they're a tool built onto the
7511440	7516320	side of cryptocurrency that only has meaningful advantages when interacting with cryptocurrency
7516320	7520440	as a tool for speculative trading and managing financial instruments.
7520440	7521800	The rest is just a gimmick.
7521800	7525320	A slow, inflexible tool for executing straw polls.
7525400	7530480	Again, a lot of these boil down to a scheme to minimize liability on the part of the creators.
7530480	7535480	The creators of Inuyasha Token, a meme coin DAO based on nothing except the ephemeral
7535480	7540800	concept of the Inuyasha anime, demonstrated this admirably when they were pressed on the
7540800	7545920	issue of copyright, openly trading on a known brand specifically for clout.
7545920	7548400	Their answer to the question boils down to 1.
7548400	7551320	A failure to understand copyright and 2.
7551320	7554560	An insistence that it doesn't matter because no one's responsible.
7554600	7555600	The DAO did it.
7555600	7558240	No, humans are liable.
7558240	7562040	Just this amorphous, sentient, carbon cloud.
7562040	7566800	You have a really good way you explain it about the copyright issue that everyone's
7566800	7570000	afraid of because they don't want to invest in a token that's going to be told to cease
7570000	7571000	and desist.
7571000	7572000	Right.
7572000	7573000	Yeah.
7573000	7581680	So to clear that up, I think first you have to distinguish between a mark and copy.
7581680	7588960	So right now, on the website, it's all custom art done by Stephen, your friend Stephen.
7588960	7589960	There is no copy.
7589960	7594480	I mean, the only person that can really copy us right now is Stephen.
7594480	7595480	You know?
7595480	7598400	Well, what about logo likeness or character likeness?
7598400	7599400	Yeah.
7599400	7607720	So, trademarks, it's possible that the Inuyasha mark could become scrutinized.
7608120	7615480	However, we're a decentralized autonomous organization officially and the token is
7615480	7618000	launched on the Ethereum blockchain.
7618000	7620560	So there's really no going back.
7620560	7623040	I'm just a community member.
7623040	7624440	I'm not an owner.
7624440	7628920	There's really no single entity that has ownership over this.
7628920	7631920	So I mean, it's on the blockchain now.
7631920	7632920	There's no going back.
7632920	7637760	And that bit also just so brilliantly demonstrates the underlying mentality of a lot of these
7637760	7638760	guys.
7638760	7643480	They wanted to use the Inuyasha brand for clout, but they didn't want to ask for permission
7643480	7645880	because they would probably get rejected.
7645880	7647680	So they did it anyway.
7647680	7651560	So now that it's on chain, it can't be easily taken down.
7651560	7655080	So I guess you just got to let them do it.
7655080	7656960	It's on the blockchain now.
7656960	7658040	There's no going back.
7658040	7661760	Things get funny in that frustrating way when you do come across a doubt that's trying
7661800	7665600	to be legitimate and they tip their hand by revealing that underneath they're legally
7665600	7669680	a co-op or an LLC or some other extant legal entity.
7669680	7674800	Unless your goal is a grift, there's nothing truly revolutionary about their structure or
7674800	7675800	functionality.
7675800	7680240	Lee Jin, the co-founder of a bunch of predatory venture capital firms that focus on polishing
7680240	7685120	the image of the gig economy to distract from the ways in which it's eroding labor, has
7685120	7689640	an extended Twitter thread where she tries to pitch dows as the future of unions, though
7689680	7695080	her rationale is not only shaky, relying heavily on magical thinking, it's also peppered with
7695080	7697000	inexplicable lies.
7697000	7701800	For example, she champions yield guild, a doubt that she describes as a gaming guild
7701800	7706560	comprised of thousands of play to earn gamers, an on-ramp that brings more players into play
7706560	7711320	to earn gaming, it can represent gamers and lobby game devs for better policies.
7711320	7716200	Its scale also enables the collective to offer benefits and protections, e.g. health care,
7716200	7721160	paid time off that would be infeasible if gamers were operating on their own.
7721160	7724720	This is a tremendous overstatement of what yield actually is.
7724720	7729200	It's not a union, nor does it function as a union, nor does it have aspirations of functioning
7729200	7730320	as a union.
7730320	7734640	It's not even a doubt, though it does have aspirations of transitioning into being one.
7734640	7738800	It's at best a mildly decentralized cartel that's experimenting with shaking down players
7738800	7743000	with the promise of helping them by gamifying the process of participating in the guild.
7743000	7747040	In practice, it's a discord server that helps play to earn players, find sponsorships,
7747040	7751000	pivot from one game to another, and generally pitch about how much their jobs suck.
7751000	7755320	In fact, in response to Legion's tweets, the server residents had this to say.
7755320	7759800	I've read that through the YGG, DAO members are able to get access to health care.
7759800	7760800	Is this true?
7760800	7761800	Is there any more info on this?
7761800	7763440	Anywhere to learn more about what is offered?
7763440	7765160	Or is this still in the works?
7765160	7768560	As a freelancer, I'm always interested to learn about more options.
7768560	7772520	I actually don't know about that, that would be awesome to get partnered with health care.
7772520	7773680	How did you get that info, though?
7773680	7775840	We haven't heard of any kind about it.
7775840	7780960	Hmm, yeah, I think Lee used it as an example of potential benefits and didn't mean it
7780960	7785120	literally, but nothing of that sort has been discussed yet.
7785120	7789720	Now on a functional level, most DAOs use an administrative system based off the use and
7789720	7792960	spending of internal script, the governance tokens.
7792960	7796360	There's a decent amount of variability in how they're used, but basically they function
7796360	7801000	either as proportional voting power, exactly the same as voting shares in a publicly traded
7801000	7806160	company, fiat voting power where there's no point in possessing more than one, or direct
7806160	7811280	voting power where tokens are spent to cast votes and more tokens can be spent to cast
7811280	7812680	more votes.
7812680	7816760	Typically this script can be bought and sold, even on a secondary market, and indeed possession
7816760	7820120	of it is typically a definitional part of membership.
7820120	7823720	Rather than structuring like a union, Yield's overt goal for their DAO is to function as
7823720	7828080	a hedge fund, using the exchange value of their token as a means to raise funds to invest
7828080	7832040	into play to earn games and allowing yield members to spend their tokens to rent these
7832040	7833880	DAO-owned resources.
7833880	7838000	In fact, Yield is so far removed from the purpose and functionality of a union that the roadmap
7838000	7842440	includes potentially implementing what's called holographic consensus, which is a futures
7842440	7847400	market where participants gamble on what proposals will or won't be passed using their governance
7847400	7849160	tokens as the stakes.
7849160	7853920	It's amazing if you wanted to build a machine whose sole purpose is to concentrate political
7853920	7855960	power slowly over time.
7856040	7860640	Additionally, many use a proof of stake staking system to reward members with additional tokens
7860640	7864120	with no gate on how many tokens any single member can hold.
7864120	7869320	This whole arrangement creates a system where participants with only a few tokens are incentivized
7869320	7875160	to not vote against the interests of highly staked members, plus anything you spend limits
7875160	7880200	what you can stake, and thus reduces all future income of tokens, which means even less voting
7880200	7881840	power in the future.
7881840	7886120	Members who possess a disproportionate share of tokens can afford to outspend on the outcome
7886120	7890440	of any vote and still retain a proportional future voting power.
7890440	7895400	At best, you end up with high-powered voting blocks, and at worst, a functional monopoly.
7895400	7900120	The internal discourse of Yield is, like all crypto, focused on the price of the DAO script
7900120	7904000	and not its actual functionality within the organization.
7904000	7908160	Rather than creating a more equitable, democratic organization that looks out for the needs
7908160	7912320	of all its members, Yield is a scheme that explicitly rewards its highest stakeholders
7912320	7914480	with more power and access.
7914480	7919440	Now, conceptually, you could make a DAO that behaves towards actually useful worker-focused
7919440	7924320	goals, but you could also do that without a DAO, because it's just an organization.
7924320	7928840	The DAO itself is just a mechanism of an organization, and more often than not, its involvement is
7928840	7930760	little more than tech fetishism.
7930760	7934680	So most actual DAOs don't resemble anything like a flat hierarchy.
7934680	7939040	In fact, the ability to buy and sell voting power and the hierarchy that results is seen
7939040	7944440	as a strict advantage in that it allows emotionally uninvested members to make money and gives
7944440	7948520	them a thing that they can reward people with that will align incentives.
7948520	7952680	And despite the fact that Li Jin is directly involved with Yield as the philosopher in
7952680	7956880	residence, Yield is neither structured like a labor union, nor does it have ambitions
7956880	7957960	to be one.
7957960	7962200	The point is that thought leaders like Li Jin, who get a lot of social traction by promising
7962200	7967280	that their techno-fetishistic community are solving big societal problems, are liars.
7967280	7971360	They love the patentry of democracy because it allows them to pretend to be democratic,
7971360	7974720	because they can paint their detractors as being undemocratic.
7974720	7978760	It's all hollow hand-waving and techno babble to distract from the fact that it's just
7978760	7979760	shareholding.
7979760	7984360	It's the corporatization of everything, the conversion of the entire world into claves
7984360	7989160	governed by power granted via token possession and enforced by machines that allow humans
7989160	7991240	to wash their hands of the outcomes.
7991240	7995160	At the end of the day, every DAO pretending to be useful is still a forced entry point
7995160	8000440	to some hype-driven meme coin whose existence only benefits its creators and the exchange
8000440	8017640	that sells it.
8017640	8020400	In 2008, the economy functionally collapsed.
8020400	8022920	The basic chain reaction was this.
8022920	8026300	Bankers took mortgages and turned them into something they could gamble on.
8026300	8028960	This created a bubble, and then the bubble popped.
8028960	8033280	When you drill down into it, you realize that the core of the crypto ecosystem, the core
8033280	8040560	of Web3, the core of the NFT marketplace, is a turf war between the wealthy and ultra-wealthy.
8040560	8045200	Technofetishists who look at people like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, billionaires minted via
8045200	8049800	tech industry doors that have now been shut by market calcification and are looking for
8049880	8055040	a do-over, looking to synthesize a new market where they can be the one to ascend from a
8055040	8059280	merely wealthy programmer to a hyper-wealthy industrialist.
8059280	8062480	It's a catfight between the 5% and the 1%.
8062480	8067600	Ultimately, the driving forces underlying this entire movement are economic disparity.
8067600	8071600	The wealthy and tenuously wealthy are looking for a space that they can dominate, where
8071600	8075920	they can be trendsetters and taste makers and can seemingly invent value through sheer
8075920	8077280	force of will.
8077280	8080960	This is, in my opinion, the blind spot of many casual critics.
8080960	8087360	The fact that tokens representing APP-FPs are useless yet somehow still expensive isn't
8087360	8090920	an overlooked glitch in the system, it's half the point.
8090920	8093440	It's a digital extension of inconvenient fashion.
8093440	8095960	It's a flex and a form of myth-making.
8095960	8097880	And that's how it draws in the bottom.
8097880	8102440	People who feel their opportunities shrinking, who see the system closing around them, who
8102440	8107920	have become isolated by social media and a global pandemic, who feel the future getting
8107920	8109160	smaller.
8109160	8114080	People pressured by the casualization of work as jobs are dissolved into the gig economy
8114080	8117320	and want to believe that escape is just that easy.
8117320	8121720	All you gotta do is bet on the right discord and you might be airdropped at the next new
8121720	8122720	hotness.
8122720	8126880	It could be you plucked out of the crowd on Rarible and bestowed a six-figure price by
8126880	8131800	an elusive Emirati music producer, get a bake in your wallet, hodl like a good diamond
8131800	8134040	hands and enjoy that yield.
8134040	8139520	All you need is $5,000 in seed money and you can buy a Farmers World milk cow and if you
8139520	8143640	milk that cow every four hours, day and night for two weeks, why there's all your money
8143640	8148880	back right there and now it's pure profit minus naturally the overhead of all the wax
8148880	8152240	you needed to stake, the barn you needed to buy and build, the barley you needed to purchase
8152240	8155560	and grow, the food you needed to buy to refill, the energy you needed to milk the cow, build
8155560	8158880	the barn and grow the barley plus you actually need to cash out which isn't getting paid,
8158880	8159880	it's quitting.
8159880	8164160	It's your chance to stick it to Wall Street and venture capitalists as long as you pay
8164160	8167000	no attention to the VCs behind the curtain.
8167000	8169840	The line can only go up.
8169840	8175640	It's a movement driven in no small part by rage, by people who looked at 2008, who looked
8175640	8180600	at the system as it exists but concluded that the problems with capitalism were that it
8180600	8184240	didn't provide enough opportunities to be the boot.
8184240	8185440	And that's the pitch.
8185440	8190640	Buy in now, buy in early and you could be the high tech future boot.
8190640	8196680	Our systems are breaking or broken, straining under neglect and sabotage and our leaders
8196680	8201240	seem at best complacent, willing to coast out the collapse.
8201240	8208000	We need something better but a system that turns everyone into petty digital landlords
8208000	8214400	that distills all interaction into transaction that determines the value of something by
8214400	8219640	how sellable it is and whether or not it can be gambled on as a fractional token sold
8219640	8222800	by a micro auction, that's not it.
8222800	8226200	A different system does not inherently mean a better system.
8226200	8228960	We replace bad systems with worse ones all the time.
8228960	8233800	We replaced a bad system of working bosses with a terrible system of apps, gigs and
8233800	8235400	on demand labor.
8235400	8240720	So it's not just that I oppose NFTs because the foremost of them are aesthetically vacuous
8240720	8245080	representations of the dead inner lives of the tech and finance bros behind them, it's
8245080	8248000	that they represent the vanguard of a worse system.
8248000	8252440	The whole thing, from open sea fantasies for starving artists to the buy in for pay to
8252440	8257000	earn games, it's the same hollow exploitative pitch as MLMs.
8257000	8261880	It's amway, but everywhere you look people are wearing ugly ass ape cartoons.
8270720	8280720	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
8280720	8290720	yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
8290720	8299720	yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
8300720	8309720	yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
8309720	8319720	yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
8319720	8326720	yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
