00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
If you watch political or historical content on YouTube, you're probably aware of Johnny Harris.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,520
He's hard to miss because YouTube's algorithm recommends his videos a lot.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,800
Back in 2021, the YouTuber Tom Nicholas made a video about Harris getting sponsored by the

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,160
World Economic Forum to make a video promoting a book they wrote. Tom used that video, called

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,520
How China Became So Powerful, as an example of how money can be used to get seemingly independent

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,880
YouTubers to make paid propaganda. Harris then responded in the comment section. He admitted

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,600
that the video was made in partnership with the WEF, but said that he didn't see a problem with it.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,920
Then in another comment, he bemoaned the fact that no one was taking the actual argument of

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,840
his video seriously. According to him, he'd done exhaustive research, sifting through lots of data

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,400
to make that video, and people were just using the fact that it was made on behalf of the WEF

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,960
as an excuse to avoid engaging with its actual content. Johnny should have been careful what he

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,520
wished for because it's come true. In this video, we're going to be refuting the actual content

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,560
of the video in question, which is not very good to say the least. If it was actually the result

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,320
of him spending loads of time researching, then his research skills should be seriously questioned.

15
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,600
This video was made possible thanks to my supporters on Patreon and Ko-fi.

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,720
This video is broadly indicative of Harris' content in general. He likes to act like he's

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,840
teaching you something new, profound, and different. Hidden knowledge of the powers that be have kept

18
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,960
on the down low. Things that go against the status quo and the taken for granted opinions that most

19
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,400
people hold. In reality, though, most of his videos are simplistic slump that serve precisely to

20
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,840
direct the audience towards conclusions that uphold the status quo, either through obfuscation,

21
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,680
or, as in the case of this video, by outright supporting it. They're usually just barrages

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,080
of rapid fire statements that Harris, and whoever works for him because he's definitely not making

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,120
these videos by himself, make little to no effort to actually explain, let alone back up with any

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,880
sources. Before you can think about what he's saying and the fact that he's not really giving

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,960
you any reason to even believe it, he's already moved on to telling you what to think about something

26
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,800
else, while stock footage plays with inspiring music and camera roll sound effects in the background.

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,920
Here's an illustrative example from the video in question.

28
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,360
This was China, the Middle Kingdom, and right next door, India. This was the center of the global

29
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,160
economic universe, but around the 1800s, that started changing.

30
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,040
Over here in Europe and the United States, there was a major revolution that started taking place.

31
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:50,480
Science, then machines, then weapons, trains, cars, flight, bombs, factories, cities,

32
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,720
and with their new power, these countries started to expand to take over large swaths of the map.

33
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,160
China remained a great civilization, but as the West started showing up,

34
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,760
knocking on China's door with their big guns, China couldn't really match their firepower,

35
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,600
and they had to concede land to Britain, which is how we got Hong Kong.

36
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,160
The Industrial Revolution didn't really happen in China the same way it did in the West,

37
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,400
and by the middle of the 1800s, China began a massive decline in its economic standing in the

38
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,360
world. A century later, that situation got way worse, as China was invaded by its neighbor,

39
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,920
Japan. China's economy was no longer the prosperous Middle Kingdom, but rather a shadow of itself,

40
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,320
a poor country that was being occupied by outsiders. Once World War II was over, the West

41
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,400
devised a new global economic and financial system. It was modeled after the economic system that

42
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,840
was working so well in the West, capitalism, free enterprise. That's really the essence of

43
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,200
Johnny Harris right there, a flurry of no context statements thrown out with little explanation and

44
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,840
backed up by nothing more than stock footage and his word. In the course of about 90 seconds,

45
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,440
he describes China as having been one of the most powerful countries in the world.

46
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,120
Then industrialization just sort of magically happening, which subsequently enabled the West

47
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:18,480
to get stronger, expand, and attack China. Then there's a 100 year time skip. It's now 1945,

48
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:25,360
and oh, Japan is invading China now, yes? So China is suddenly relatively weak now,

49
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,880
and oh, there's capitalism too apparently. What a ride that was. Harris has all of this

50
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,240
completely backwards. He presents the industrial revolution like it's what enabled the European

51
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,680
colonialism that he refers to as expansion. Yet said colonialism predated the industrial

52
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,600
revolution, which began in the 18th century by hundreds of years. So it was the colonialism

53
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,800
that enabled the industrial revolution, not the other way around. The historian Eric Williams

54
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,000
showed via exhaustive archival research that the profits that funded much of the first industrial

55
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,560
revolution, and thus led to everything that came afterwards, came from British slave colonies in

56
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,000
the Caribbean. And that's just one small example of how the murder, subjugation, and dispossession

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,920
of much of the rest of the world is what the West's economic power and the development of

58
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,040
capitalism was built on. So it was colonialism elsewhere that gave the Western countries the

59
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,560
advantages that they needed to subsequently colonize China and eliminate it as a competitor,

60
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,440
rather than just some magical sudden explosion of technology and science that they then took

61
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,600
advantage of. I love how he actually verbatim just exclaims science. It's like a Tim and Eric

62
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,240
skit. Science. So huge L to China for making the fatal mistake of not killing, robbing,

63
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,880
and enslaving people on the other side of the world to spur their own industrial revolution.

64
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,000
The main narrative throughout this video is that free market capitalism is amazing. So his reasons

65
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,560
for skipping over what actually happened so egregiously can be deduced pretty easily. It's

66
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,000
a lot easier to make a video celebrating capitalist free enterprise if you ignore the much less

67
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,880
savoury reality of how it came to be. And he especially needed to do this because the World

68
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,920
Economic Forum probably wouldn't be very happy about a video that presents the early development

69
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:15,280
of capitalism and capitalism in general for that matter in anything but a glowing light.

70
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,480
The final bit of that clip and what comes after it is particularly characteristic of the often

71
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:27,760
chaotic poorly structured zero substance nature of Johnny Harris's videos. The West devised a new

72
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,680
global economic and financial system. It was modeled after the economic system that was working so

73
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,280
well in the West. Capitalism. Free enterprise. Still with some government oversight and high

74
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,320
taxes for the rich and corporations, but it was still capitalism. So there's a 100 a year time

75
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,720
skipped to 1945 and capitalism is only being introduced now. Not with the industrial revolution

76
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,360
of two centuries beforehand, which he covered about a minute earlier. He then tells us that

77
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,200
before this, this capitalism was working so well in the West. But this is contradicted by the very

78
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,720
fact that what he's describing here is the Bretton Woods economic system established by the USA and

79
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,800
other Western countries at the end of World War II. Though you might have missed that because he

80
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,320
just glosses over all the details entirely. He just flashes Bretton Woods on the screen and explains

81
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,600
nothing about it beyond it apparently involving more government oversight and higher taxes on the

82
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,040
rich. The post war Western economic order, which is known as the Bretton Woods system was a pretty

83
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,000
substantial departure from how things were before it and we'll be going into that in more depth later.

84
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,600
The point here though is if things were going so well beforehand as Harris claims,

85
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,360
it was modeled after the economic system that was working so well in the West.

86
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,800
Then why would such substantial reforms have even been carried out? They wouldn't have been,

87
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,400
obviously. This was just six years after the end of the Great Depression, the worst economic crisis

88
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,640
in recorded history, which was immediately followed by World War II, the worst war in recorded history.

89
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:04,000
So capitalism clearly wasn't actually working well at the time at all and that was precisely

90
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,880
why these reforms were instituted. Harris is honestly often kind of difficult to respond to

91
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,200
because he just makes statements like that which amounts a little more than things were good,

92
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,560
so everyone agreed to do more good things. In reference to the fucking Great Depression,

93
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,240
World War fucking II and the sweeping economic reforms that were carried out afterwards in

94
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,280
an attempt to try and ensure that those things didn't happen again. It's genuinely childish.

95
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,280
He presents history as if it has no context, no continuity, no nothing. To refute him,

96
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,840
I had to go over the basics of what actually happened from scratch because his video just

97
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,640
doesn't actually explain anything at all. And it's not like he's just getting some minor details

98
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,120
wrong either. He's grossly mischaracterizing everything and leaving out so much crucial

99
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,360
information that contradicts him that any response to his claims takes 5,000 times more effort than

100
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,880
he put in to make them in the first place. Like he just blurts out that capitalism was working

101
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,320
so well. That's a pretty bold statement to make about the world in 1945, given everything that

102
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,280
had just happened in the decade or so prior. You'd think he'd at least expand on why he's saying

103
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,640
that with some examples as to why and maybe even, I don't know, provide some proof to back it up,

104
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,080
but Johnny Harris is above such pettiness. He just says stuff and then moves on. The audience

105
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,920
is to just trust him. His videos are just a barrage of statement after statement, 90% of them

106
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,600
backed up by nothing more than his undue confidence, maybe 10% of them actually being followed up with

107
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,040
any attempt to explain the why and how of what he's saying, and even fewer than that backed up by

108
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,160
anything even resembling a source. When he finally does get around to trying to present some evidence,

109
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,440
it usually doesn't even actually back up what he's saying. And it sometimes even presents it as if

110
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,720
it's some sort of special event. It's snappily edited and the music ramps up as if to say,

111
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,400
look guys, I'm citing a source. I did it. You can trust me. He does exactly that in this video

112
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,800
actually. After seven minutes of rapid fire statements with next to nothing presented to

113
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:14,880
even try to back them up, this happens. I have two graphs I want to show you. They look like this.

114
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:22,320
Wow. Great graphs he got there, dude. Excellent job. You finally presented a source. It's really

115
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,560
propaganda theater. It's made to look and sound like it's insightful, informative, authoritative,

116
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,440
and thus correct. But it falls apart immediately if you watch it while paying full attention and

117
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,080
think about what's being said and what you're being shown. The video that we're covering here is an

118
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:44,480
amazing example of all of this. It is the Johnny Harris video, par excellence. I speak good French,

119
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,640
but it's also a paid propaganda video designed to dishonestly present the worst ideas from the

120
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,520
world's most powerful and ghoulish capitalist and their corporations hatch for the purposes of

121
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,480
maintaining their own power and wealth as if they're actually beneficial to the average person.

122
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,200
Despite the title ostensibly being about China, it really has little to nothing to do with it.

123
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,040
China is just used as a framing device to celebrate free markets, neoliberal capitalism,

124
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,640
and then suggest more neoliberal capitalism as the solution to problems caused by neoliberal

125
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,360
capitalism on behalf of the elites who have themselves benefited the most from neoliberal

126
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,120
capitalism. Johnny Harris's videos already tend to be pretty childish propaganda, and in this one,

127
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,080
where he's being paid by the World Economic Forum, he becomes a parody of himself.

128
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,240
Something that Tom Nicholas didn't quite cover in his video is that Johnny Harris

129
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,800
completely misrepresents the ideas that he's being paid to promote here, which are actually

130
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,080
even worse than what they already seem like on the surface. He lied in order to paint a scheme

131
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,920
crafted by billionaires to institute direct corporate rule over international governmental

132
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,760
systems such as the UN as actually just little more than corporations being a bit nicer to their

133
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,560
workers. And I'm well aware of the fact that that sounds like a conspiratorial exaggeration,

134
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,440
but as I'm about to show you, it's really not. We're going to continue on here from the second

135
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,320
half of the video, and then we're going to go back and dissect the rest of the first half afterwards.

136
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,400
This is because it's only at the halfway point that he actually plays his hand

137
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,720
and gets down to the real point of the video, which is to be propaganda for the World Economic

138
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,240
Forum. So dissecting this bit is the most important thing to do here, and it's also very important

139
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,480
context for the first half of the video too, because it's just so blatantly wrong about

140
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,800
everything that it only really starts to make sense once you realize that the reason that it's

141
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,960
like that is because the creator was being paid to lie. Part one, Johnny lies for the World Economic

142
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:47,440
Forum. The World Economic Forum, which Johnny Harris very dishonestly presents as just a

143
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,120
think tank, and I was able to partner with the World Economic Forum, which is a think tank that

144
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,880
I respect, is the world's most powerful advocacy group for corporations and the ultra rich. On the

145
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,480
one hand, it uses resources from its paid members, including pretty much every single one of the

146
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,880
worst corporations that you can think of, to lobby governments and international organizations,

147
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,240
such as the UN, to adopt policies that benefit them at the expense of everyone else. This is the part

148
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,440
of the World Economic Forum, which is most insidious, and it often goes under the radar. So how convenient

149
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,080
it is that in this video, by coincidence, we're going to be covering it. On the other hand,

150
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,960
it and the events that it organizes, such as its yearly summit at Davos in Switzerland,

151
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,560
act as a public relations exercise for its donors and members, as Tom Nicholas explained very well.

152
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,680
Davos and the World Economic Forum then are essentially where the richest 1%

153
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,480
go to pretend to have a conscience. While I'm sure there's plenty of backgroom

154
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,280
wheeling and dealing which is facilitated by the World Economic Forum, in terms of its public

155
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:55,840
facing activities, it serves as a means for global corporations and the super rich to repeatedly

156
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:02,080
pretend to have seen the error of their ways and to be on the cusp of change before they go back to

157
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:09,440
their boardrooms to carry on with business as usual. So Harris establishes the basis for his

158
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,120
talking points taken directly from decades of World Economic Forum propaganda by making a couple

159
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,840
of core claims. Firstly, he claims that the shift in economic policy in the West in the 70s and 80s

160
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:28,240
towards neoliberalism made the West more prosperous. He makes this clear by continuously praising

161
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,440
probably the most famous neoliberal ideologue of all time, Milton Friedman, and implying that the

162
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,920
policies that he supported worked really well and that he had a point. Milton Friedman sort of had a point

163
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,760
and it led to huge prosperity in the West as the US economy exploded.

164
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,040
All of this is false and we're going to be refuting it in detail in part two of this video.

165
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,560
Side note, if you're confused by me talking about neoliberalism here, then don't worry because I'm

166
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,800
going to be explaining more about it as we get through the video. And I also have a whole video

167
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,440
that explains it and its history in detail that you can check out. To be honest, you'd almost

168
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,000
certainly learn way more that's actually useful by watching that video over this one, though it's

169
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,320
also going to be considerably less entertaining than watching Johnny Harris get embarrassed.

170
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,000
Pick your poison. The second core claim that Harris bases his conclusions on is the idea that

171
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,920
the most important defining part of the modern economic era, again beginning in the 70s and 80s,

172
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:33,920
is that corporations are now driven by a desire to make profits for their shareholders. So important

173
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:39,120
and different this has supposedly been that it even merits being delineated as a completely

174
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:46,160
different form of capitalism known as shareholder capitalism. The idea at the core of this financial

175
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,560
and economic system was that companies would get investment from people who own shares in that

176
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,080
company, we call this a corporation, and that the sole purpose of this corporation was to make

177
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:03,840
money for these owners or these shareholders. Now this simply isn't true. The defining thing

178
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,360
about this era was that neoliberalism inspired economic policies began to be implemented in

179
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,800
practice in the 1970s and spread all over the world in a couple of decades. Not that there was some

180
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,000
sort of massive paradigm shift where companies started seeking profit more than they had before.

181
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,400
A shareholder is after all just someone who owns a part of a company, which might vary from a

182
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:30,400
completely insignificant amount to a controlling stake. Corporations have obviously always been

183
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:37,120
driven by seeking as much profit for their owners as possible. You can go back 110, 120 years or so

184
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,040
to the era of standard oil for example, one of the most infamously horrible corporations in history

185
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,920
and see that things were much the same. Companies seeking shareholder profit, which according to

186
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,680
Harris is the most important defining part of the neoliberal era, is actually so unimportant to

187
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,200
it that Friedman, the theorist who he cites approvingly throughout the video, didn't even mention

188
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,120
that in his own definition of neoliberalism. He wrote, Neoliberalism would accept the 19th

189
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,440
century liberal emphasis on the fundamental importance of the individual, but it would

190
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,440
substitute for the 19th century goal of laissez-faire as a means to this end, the goal of the competitive

191
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:21,120
order. It would seek to use competition among producers to protect consumers from exploitation,

192
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,000
competition among employers to protect workers and owners of property, and competition among

193
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,280
consumers to protect the enterprises themselves. The state would police the system, establish

194
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,400
conditions favorable to competition and prevent monopoly, provide a stable monetary framework,

195
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,200
and relieve acute misery and distress. The citizens would be protected against the state by the

196
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,480
existence of a private free market, and against one another by the preservation of competition.

197
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,080
So the actual crux of neoliberalism according to Friedman is that competition is everything,

198
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,680
that the best society is a dog-eat-dog capitalist one, where everyone and everything is in a

199
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,720
competition with one another at all times, with the spoils going to the winners and the losers

200
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,600
getting as little as possible. Friedman says that the government should try to foster such a society

201
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,880
and froze in some platitudes about this all supposedly being to protect people and a laughable

202
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,840
bit about preventing monopoly. There's nothing about shareholders there, and that's because

203
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,280
shareholder capitalism is just a buzzword that the World Economic Forum likes to use to divert

204
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,480
attention away from neoliberal economic policies and blame the problems that they have caused on

205
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,320
a complete red herring. Harris is just parroting them here, which is, you know, what you'd expect,

206
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,760
given that they paid him to make this video. A good basic summary of what neoliberalism is in

207
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,920
practice comes from the economic historian David Harvey. Neoliberalism is in the first instance

208
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,760
a theory of political economic practices that proposes that human well-being can best be advanced

209
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,120
by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework

210
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,160
characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade. The role of the

211
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,360
state is to create and preserve an institutional framework appropriate to such practices. The

212
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,120
state has to guarantee, for example, the quality and integrity of money. It must also set up those

213
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,360
military, defense, police, and legal structures and functions required to secure private property

214
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,880
rights and to guarantee, by force if need be, the proper functioning of markets. Furthermore,

215
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,920
if markets do not exist in areas such as land, water, education, healthcare, social security,

216
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,600
or environmental pollution, then they must be created by state action if necessary. But beyond

217
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,960
these tasks, the state should not venture. State interventions in markets, once created,

218
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,720
must be kept to a bare minimum. There has everywhere been an emphatic turn towards neoliberalism

219
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:55,440
in political economic practices and thinking since the 1970s. Deregulation, privatization,

220
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,800
and withdrawal of the state from many areas of social provision have become all too common.

221
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,560
Almost all states, from those newly minted after the collapse of the Soviet Union to old-style

222
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,200
social democracies in welfare states such as New Zealand and Sweden, have embraced,

223
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,480
sometimes voluntarily and in other instances in response to coercive pressures, some version

224
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,240
of neoliberal theory, and adjusted at least some policies and practices accordingly. That's all

225
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,320
exactly the sort of thinking and exactly the sort of economic policies that the World Economic Forum

226
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,280
advocates for and that its corporate members benefit from. So they pretty clearly aren't

227
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,120
actually against the fundamentals of the economics of this period. So what they instead do is try

228
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,720
and convince people that the economic problems of the last 40 to 50 years haven't actually been

229
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,800
caused by these policies or by flaws in capitalism itself, but rather just by corporations making

230
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,920
a mistake and seeking too much profit. Which apparently wasn't a problem before this,

231
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:01,360
because if we believe this, then they can sell us the idea that the way to fix this problem isn't

232
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,560
actually by governments taking meaningful action to rein these corporations in, or any change at all

233
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,840
to the economic system itself, but rather by just leaving it to corporations to change how they

234
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,960
govern themselves. Just trusting them to voluntarily stop being driven by profit,

235
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,560
become socially responsible in other such buzzwords and fix it all themselves. Surely

236
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,160
that being honest here, that'll definitely work. This is how the WEF tends to conduct a lot of its

237
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:33,520
public relations exercises. They acknowledge the issues caused by pro-corporate policies,

238
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,240
such as massive inequality and climate change, because it's kind of impossible for them to ignore

239
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,600
them at this point. But they frame these problems as being caused by things other than their actual

240
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,880
causes, because if we accept their alternate explanation, they can then lead us to the conclusion

241
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,080
that the overall direction of economic policy should remain fundamentally the same as it has

242
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,840
since the 70s and 80s, which is, you know, exactly what they want. It's simple diversion.

243
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,640
So, once Harris has finally stopped lying to the viewer about the cause of those problems in the

244
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,280
exact same way the World Economic Forum does, he, shocker, proposes the exact solution they do.

245
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,640
But of course, he first takes a second to just offhandedly scoff at the idea that socialism

246
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,160
might be an alternative solution. In true Johnny Harris fashion, no reasoning or explanation for

247
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:30,080
this is given. So, what's the solution? Is it socialism? No, it's not. It is simply a new

248
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,520
version of capitalism, a reframing of how we think about business and globalization.

249
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,440
No, he says with utmost confidence. The real solution is to move on to another form of capitalism

250
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,600
from this non-existent shareholder one. What we need to do is just change the way we think about

251
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,640
business and globalization. He's not actually calling for any action in that buzzword salad,

252
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,440
just a change in thinking, which is reflected in the solution that he's about to propose,

253
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,320
doing the same stuff, but reframing it as somehow actually beneficial for workers.

254
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,840
The mythology of neoliberalism supposedly being good for normal people can no longer be upheld

255
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,560
since the last 50 years of its practice have shown us clearly that that's not true. So,

256
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:18,240
it needs a rebranding. And here it is. The solution isn't to scrap capitalism altogether,

257
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,080
but instead to expand it, to not just focus on shareholders and delivering them short-term

258
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,120
profits as quickly and as efficiently as possible, but to also focus on other people

259
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,760
who are affected by the business. You can call these stakeholders. This is like the customers

260
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,520
and the suppliers and the employees and the government and the overall economy and the planet

261
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,400
and, of course, shareholders. This is called stakeholder capitalism. And it's basically

262
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,440
just an acknowledgement that businesses that focus only on profits for shareholders don't

263
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,960
end up benefiting everyone. There are winners and losers. So, the solution to the problems

264
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:04,320
of corporations being motivated by self-interest is for corporations to magically just no longer

265
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,240
be motivated by self-interest and to start just miraculously renouncing the profit motive,

266
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,800
getting themselves a conscience, and voluntarily helping everyone out of the goodness of their

267
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,880
hearts, which they don't have because they're corporations. There's not any sort of actual

268
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,560
call to action to make this happen. No government intervention, no regulations, no nothing. It's

269
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:30,080
just something that we need to trust corporations to do themselves. Yeah. Obviously, this isn't

270
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,640
going to happen. Corporations are not just going to regulate themselves out of a sense of social

271
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,800
obligation. They're not just going to give up their wealth and power because they feel bad about

272
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,480
having it. On the occasions that they do actually concede things to other so-called stakeholders,

273
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:51,040
it is overwhelmingly because they're forced to do so by government action. And on the very rare

274
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:56,160
occasions where it might seem like they're taking such actions themselves, it's certainly not out

275
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:01,280
of a sense of obligation to other stakeholders. It's just because they've calculated that doing

276
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:07,360
so won't damage or will increase their profits in other ways. For example, by giving them good

277
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,280
publicity, by increasing worker productivity, or by keeping workers just happy enough that they're

278
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,560
less likely to start advocating for something that might end up costing the company more. A good

279
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,000
example of this is Amazon instituting a minimum wage of $15 an hour for American employees.

280
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,320
It helps to make them look like they care about their workers, while at the same time,

281
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,360
they do everything possible to bust their workers' efforts at unionization to prevent them from

282
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,320
actually being able to exert collective pressure on the company and advocate for their own interests

283
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,760
on their own terms. It's not about the company legitimately caring about its stakeholders or

284
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,640
anything even remotely like that. It's about unaccountable executives deciding to give them

285
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,200
a little bit in the hopes that they don't start demanding something more substantial that would

286
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,960
lower their profits more. And Amazon, completely coincidentally I'm sure, just so happens to be

287
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,800
one of the World Economic Forum's strategic partners. Tom Nicholas summed up the essence of all of this

288
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:10,160
very well. The World Economic Forum's decision to work with Johnny Harris to create a video about

289
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:16,400
how companies such as Apple and Walmart are currently enthusiastically moving away from

290
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,480
shareholder capitalism and towards this vague notion of stakeholder capitalism is just another

291
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:29,440
in a long line of examples of the forum attempting to convince us that against all the evidence

292
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:35,040
they are even remotely concerned about anything other than profit. With everything that we've

293
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,640
just been over in mind, I want to present you with a quote from this book, Stakeholder Capitalism,

294
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,840
which is the book that the World Economic Forum paid Johnny Harris to make this video to promote.

295
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,360
The head of the World Economic Forum just launched a book called literally Stakeholder Capitalism.

296
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:56,560
It's an in-depth look at not only the rise of Asia and China, but also other major trends that

297
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,040
help us understand the need to upgrade our capitalism. Klaus Schwab, the founder of the

298
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:07,600
World Economic Forum, writes within it, I therefore advocate for a third system which can be defined

299
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,320
as stakeholder capitalism. It is capitalism in the traditional definition of the word.

300
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:17,920
Individuals and private companies make up the largest share of the economy. This is, I believe,

301
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,200
a requirement for a sustainable economic system. Private individuals and companies must be able

302
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,800
to innovate and compete freely, as it unleashes the creative energy and work ethic of most people

303
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:34,480
in society. The economic activities of such private actors must also be protected and guided,

304
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,120
to ensure the overall direction of economic development is beneficial to society,

305
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,560
and no actor can free ride on the efforts of others. This is the kind of capitalism we ought to

306
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:48,960
endorse. Do you notice how that sounds oddly similar to Milton Friedman's description of

307
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,920
neoliberalism that we went over earlier? That's because it is just the same thing. The whole

308
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:59,680
notion of stakeholder capitalism, as presented in this video by Johnny Harris, and as obsessed about

309
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:06,160
by the World Economic Forum, is just a rebranding of neoliberalism. Harris and the WEF erased the

310
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:12,000
existence of neoliberalism entirely, creating this phantom of shareholder capitalism to shoulder

311
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,720
the blame for its problems and act as a sort of non-existent scapegoat, in order to propose a

312
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,080
solution that they frame as literally an entirely different version of capitalism, which even the

313
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,880
slightest scrutiny reveals is still just neoliberalism, with some vague, PR speak buzzwords thrown in

314
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,480
to try and make it sound like it's somehow different. It's not. As political scientist Kyle

315
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,720
Bailey wrote, now that the myth of free markets can no longer convincingly naturalize the public

316
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:46,880
role of states, in imposing actually existing neoliberalism, the discourse of stakeholder

317
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,440
capitalism represents its continuation by other means. Despite pretensions to move beyond profit

318
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,600
maximization, corporations' attempts to satisfy extra economic interests remain firmly grounded

319
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,040
in the same capitalist market imperatives that proponents of stakeholder capitalism now claim

320
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,800
to be addressing. Here's an even worse thing though. Harris isn't even actually being honest

321
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:15,840
about what's stakeholder capitalism, as promoted by the World Economic Forum in the book that he's

322
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,880
trying to sell to his viewers here, actually is. His presentation are that he's already incredibly

323
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:27,360
misleading, dishonest, and really just full of lies, but he also left out the more unsavory and

324
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,560
much more serious parts about what this term means to the World Economic Forum. You see,

325
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:38,320
they don't just think that companies should take their stakeholders into account or whatever.

326
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:45,760
For them, this notion of stakeholderism extends to everything, including national and international

327
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:53,440
governance. They consider multinational corporations to be stakeholders of the world itself, who

328
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:59,200
should have much bigger and much more direct seats at the table when it comes to political

329
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,640
decision making. The BS about corporations saving the world out of the goodness of their hearts

330
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,000
by deciding to treat workers slightly better rather than seeking profits is cover for their

331
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,480
ultimate idea of giving corporations even more political power than what they already have.

332
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,320
This is articulated in the book itself. A company that has a multinational scope of activities

333
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,880
not only serves all those stakeholders who are directly engaged, but acts itself as a stakeholder

334
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,680
together with governments and civil society of our global future. So, according to the very book

335
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:41,200
that Harris was paid to promote, multinational corporations need to be stakeholders on the

336
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,120
national and international stage, on the same level as national governments and civil society

337
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,440
organizations, the latter meaning things like NGOs, which are themselves overwhelmingly founded

338
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,600
and or funded by those same multinational corporations and so advocate for their interests

339
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,200
as well anyway. This is what the stakeholder capitalism buzzword is actually about for them,

340
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,200
giving corporations even more direct decision making power regarding the direction of global

341
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,880
politics on top of all of the incredibly pervasive and destructive ways in which they already

342
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,120
influence global politics. They hide this goal of wanting to make themselves even more powerful

343
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,960
stakeholders in international governance behind this notion that all they want to do is make you

344
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:35,760
a stakeholder of the company that you work for. The economist Jens Martens summarized the WEF's

345
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,240
overall agenda. The World Economic Forum postulates that a globalized world is best managed by a

346
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,560
coalition of multinational corporations, governments, including through the UN system, and select civil

347
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,320
society organizations. It argues that governments no longer are the overwhelmingly dominant actors

348
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:00,000
on the world stage and that the time has come for a new stakeholder paradigm of international

349
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
governance. The World Economic Forum vision includes a public private UN in which certain

350
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
specialized agencies would operate under joint state and non-state governance systems such as with

351
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,440
the Food and Agriculture Organization through a global food agriculture and nutrition redesign

352
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,040
initiative. This model also assumes that some issues would be taken off the agenda of the UN

353
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:29,280
system to be addressed by pluralateral, often multi-stakeholder, coalitions of the willing and

354
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:35,760
able. What the World Economic Forum is advocating for with this red herring of stakeholder capitalism

355
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,000
is not the solution to the problems of neoliberalism that Harris presents it as,

356
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,560
nor is it meant to be. It is rather the final form of neoliberalism, the fundamental neoliberal

357
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:52,960
notion of total and complete competition is taken to the ultimate extreme, corporations competing

358
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,840
with governments for the power to govern in a much more direct way than they have before.

359
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,760
And it's even worse with a bit more added context. Klaus Schwab, founder and chairman of the WEF,

360
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,000
whose name is on the cover of the book, though you know it was almost certainly ghost written,

361
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,440
has said that he considers nation states to be obsolete and that they should be replaced with

362
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,560
a global issue alliance, which based on their other statements would probably be made up of

363
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:24,560
multinational corporations. In context with everything else, it really makes it seem like their

364
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:30,480
ultimate goal is not just the already incredibly worrying idea of taking substantial decision

365
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,840
making power away from states and handing it directly to multinational corporations,

366
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,000
but rather to get rid of governments entirely and create some sort of anarcho-capitalist cyberpunk

367
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,440
dystopia, where corporations just plain control everything. Now I don't want to fear Monger too

368
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,800
much about the WEF's agenda here, while they have laid it all out pretty clearly and pretty

369
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,120
explicitly, that doesn't mean that they've gotten their way or that they will. There is no

370
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,240
world economic forum led, new world order government on the way or anything, which conspiracy

371
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,800
theorists often claim. Though given the kind of stuff that the world economic forum advocates

372
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:12,640
for that we just went over, I can really understand how such conspiracy theories come to be.

373
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,200
The WEF is just an advocacy group for corporations that ask the question of,

374
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,240
how can corporations get even more power? And they came to the quite rational conclusion from

375
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,680
their perspective of, they should try to seize more direct decision making power from governments

376
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:32,320
themselves. This is completely predictable and expected, which is precisely why corporate

377
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,000
governed dystopias were already being presented in fiction, long before the WEF proposed such

378
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,600
ideas themselves. It's simply the logic of capitalism being taken to its ultimate conclusion.

379
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,840
But these goals also aren't zero sum. It's not either they establish the literal anarcho-capitalist

380
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,760
cyberpunk dystopia or their failed. They just want as much direct influence over decision making as

381
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,400
they can get, and they've actually already been making inroads on this for quite a while now.

382
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,840
In the UN for example, the influence of their rhetoric can clearly be seen. Buzzwords for

383
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:12,080
pervasive corporate involvement, like multi-stakeholderism and public-private partnerships,

384
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,760
have become more and more common in UN documents. And multinationals have an even more prominent

385
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,880
and direct role in the UN and other global initiatives than they've ever had before.

386
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,040
In 2019, the World Economic Forum even signed a strategic partnership agreement with the UN.

387
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,720
This is extremely bad, not just because more corporate power and influence is bad in general,

388
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:40,160
but also because it's even more undemocratic than things already were before. While average people

389
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,800
may be able to exert at least a tiny little bit of influence over their governments through things

390
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,320
like voting and protests for example, they have nothing even resembling that minor little bit of

391
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,440
influence when it comes to corporations. So with every little bit of decision making ability that

392
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,680
corporations wrestle away from states, nationally or internationally, you and people like you lose

393
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,880
more of whatever little decision making power you've got left. It's being appropriated from you

394
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,320
and being handed over to capitalists and executives directly. In order to even think about fighting

395
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,640
these sorts of initiatives, we first need to actually know that they're going on. And now you

396
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,560
do, despite the fact that Johnny Harris kind of forgot to inform you of that in his video. Harris

397
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,040
outright stated that he read the book and thought that it was great. The book is really good. Yet

398
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,160
he nonetheless decided to leave out the whole, corporations should be stakeholders in global

399
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,080
governance and get their own seats at the UN thing. He's even proudly gloated that he was personally

400
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:45,760
involved in that year's WEF summit at Davos. The Davos summit happened this week and I'm really

401
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,960
glad that I was able to be a part of it. So he's clearly familiar with the organization and he

402
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,520
should be familiar with their broader agendas too. They're outlined in the book that he supposedly

403
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,120
read. The book that he promotes in this video. His video is already garbage immoral propaganda,

404
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:08,240
but with this extra context, it is even worse. He lied knowingly in exchange for money. It's

405
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,680
that simple. And we haven't even covered the rest of the video yet where he lies a whole lot more.

406
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,240
Part 2. The Debunking

407
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,240
Now with the most important part out of the way, it's time to go back to the first half of the

408
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,080
video and refute the historical narrative of neoliberalism bringing amazing prosperity and

409
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:33,360
the claims that Harris makes to craft it, which is the foundation that he uses to propose the

410
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:39,200
ideas that we just dissected. How the video has a title about China, I just don't know. It's

411
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,560
mentioned in the intro, promptly forgotten about for a while, and then glossed over for a minute or

412
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,320
two later. It's actually a video about how great free market capitalism supposedly is, and China

413
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:56,000
is just used as a framing device for that to pull the viewer in to what is actually a paid propaganda

414
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,560
video. This part is going to be quite long and detailed, partly because the effort that you have

415
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,600
to put in to debunk misinformation is incredibly high relative to the effort that it takes to make

416
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:11,840
it up, and partly because that's just how my videos are. I like to be thorough. So let's recap

417
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:17,200
and expand upon what we went over at the beginning. The video starts off with this zero context

418
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,800
presentation of the industrial revolution as some sort of miracle that just magically popped up out

419
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,360
of nowhere. Inverting reality to make it sound like it was the industrial revolution that birthed

420
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,720
western colonialism rather than the other way around. And capitalism doesn't sound quite as

421
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:41,200
good if you actually include the fact that what Harris frames as the West's amazing success was

422
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,240
built on the subjugation of billions of people. It's important to emphasize that the development

423
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,000
of the industrial revolution was hardly some sort of miracle of free market capitalism, as is often

424
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,920
taken for granted, including by Harris here. It happened under the circumstances of pervasive

425
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,440
government protection of local industry, combined with the aggressive destruction of competitors

426
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,600
abroad, and the importation of resources and capital to be invested from the Americas. The best

427
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,960
example of this is the development of the British textiles industry, the first truly fully mechanized

428
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,080
industry in the world, and the most emblematic development of the first industrial revolution.

429
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:25,600
This industry was not only supplied by slave farmed cotton from the Americas, but was also

430
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,800
fostered by the government, who put restrictive tariffs on textile imports from India, which at

431
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,160
the time had the most important textile export sector in the world. This encouraged investment

432
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:42,160
in the local textile industry to replace these imports. This is commonly known as import substitution

433
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,520
industrialization. All of this happened while the British were also simultaneously colonizing

434
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,040
India and directly destroying the Indian textile industry. The result was that the British textile

435
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,480
industry became the world's most important, even exporting its products to India itself.

436
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,320
So the industrial revolution was built off the back of colonialism and spurred by very

437
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,960
anti-free market government interference, contrary to pretty much everything about

438
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,000
Harris's narrative throughout this video. Most developed countries today in fact industrialize

439
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,440
with these sorts of policies, protectionism, import substitution, etc, and they only started

440
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,120
with this rhetoric of free international trade once their own industry was developed enough as

441
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:32,000
a result to out-compete that of other countries. So anyway, moving on. As we went over earlier,

442
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,440
Harris then finally introduces capitalism in 1945, about 200 or 300 years depending on who you ask,

443
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,080
after the time that it actually developed, conveniently skipping over all of the absolutely

444
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:49,200
horrible things about it during that period. He then moves on to inverting reality again,

445
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,360
claiming that capitalism was working so well while simultaneously introducing the post-World

446
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:01,200
War II Bretton Woods Accords. Bretton Woods was an agreement between mostly western states that

447
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,880
govern the rules of international trade between them for about 30 years afterwards. This was

448
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,920
specifically implemented because capitalism actually wasn't working very well and had just

449
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,800
been through its worst ever crisis, the Great Depression, and you know the whole World War II

450
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,480
thing too. The Bretton Woods era was characterized by fixed currency exchange rates for international

451
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,800
trade which were backed by the gold standard, tightened government regulations on business,

452
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,320
strong welfare states, and so-called mixed economies involving both private and public

453
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:38,080
sector ownership. Academically, this is often known as the period of embedded liberalism.

454
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:43,040
The embedded part comes from the work of the economic theorist Carl Polanyi who used the

455
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:49,760
word to emphasize the controls put on markets by outside factors such as the government as opposed

456
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,360
to disembedded, which describes a more free market that is not subject to such controls.

457
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:00,320
David Harvey summarized the causes and characteristics of the period of embedded

458
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:06,080
liberalism in the West. The restructuring of state forms and of international relations

459
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:11,120
after the Second World War was designed to prevent a return to the catastrophic conditions

460
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:16,080
that had so threatened the capitalist order in the great slump of the 1930s. It was also

461
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,960
supposed to prevent the reemergence of interstate geopolitical rivalries that had led to the war.

462
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,240
To ensure domestic peace and tranquility, some sort of class compromise between capital and

463
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,520
labor had to be constructed. The thinking at the time is perhaps best represented by an influential

464
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:37,760
text by two eminent social scientists, Robert Dahl and Charles Limblum, published in 1953.

465
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,360
Both capitalism and communism in their raw forms had failed, they argued. The only way ahead was to

466
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:49,760
construct the right blend of state, market, and democratic institutions to guarantee peace, inclusion,

467
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,040
well-being, and stability. And so a variety of social democratic, Christian democratic,

468
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:00,560
and dyrihista states emerged in Europe after the Second World War. The US itself turned

469
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:06,000
towards a liberal democratic state form, and Japan, under the close supervision of the US,

470
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,240
built a nominally democratic but impracticed highly bureaucratic state apparatus,

471
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,960
empowered to oversee the reconstruction of that country. What all of these various state forms

472
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,800
had in common was an acceptance that the state should focus on full employment, economic growth,

473
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,320
and the welfare of its citizens, and that state power should be freely deployed alongside, or if

474
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:32,080
necessary, intervening in or even substituting for market processes to achieve these ends.

475
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:37,840
Fiscal and monetary policies, usually dubbed Keynesian, were widely deployed to dampen business

476
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:43,840
cycles and to ensure reasonably full employment. A class compromise between capital and labor

477
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:49,760
was generally advocated as a key guarantor of domestic peace and tranquility. States actively

478
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,200
intervened in industrial policy and moved to set standards for the social wage by constructing

479
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,720
a variety of welfare systems, healthcare, education, and the like. This form of political

480
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,640
organization is now usually referred to as embedded liberalism, to signal how market

481
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,680
processes and entrepreneurial and corporate activities were surrounded by a web of social

482
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,720
and political constraints and a regulatory environment that sometimes restrained but in

483
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,240
other instances led the way in economic and industrial strategy. State-led planning and in

484
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:28,880
some instances, state ownership of key sectors, coal, steel, automobiles, were not uncommon. For

485
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,400
example, in Britain, France, and Italy. The neoliberal project is to disembed capital

486
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,720
from these constraints. So yeah, not exactly the sort of thing that Harris is advocating for in

487
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,520
this video. Harris glosses over the amount of government intervention that actually characterized

488
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,280
this era, acknowledging only that it involved government oversight and higher taxes and regulation,

489
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,800
but nonetheless framing it as largely the same as before. A continuation of something that was

490
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:03,200
working so well, which is a very audacious thing to say about the period immediately following

491
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,520
the Great Depression and World War II. He then credits a vague notion of capitalism with rebuilding

492
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,320
Europe after the war, as if it was just the wonders of the free market that did it or something.

493
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:19,760
Seriously, he talks about this in the same way that a missionary would tell you about the miracles

494
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,680
of Jesus Christ. Capitalism, free enterprise, still with some government oversight and high

495
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,240
taxes for the rich and corporations, but it was still capitalism. And after the war,

496
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,800
this capitalism would go on to become a miracle for many countries. Rebuilding Germany, France,

497
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:43,440
Japan. For many in the West, post-World War II capitalism was like a magic elixir that was fixing

498
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:50,720
everything. He verbatim calls it a magic elixir that was fixing everything. At least try to be

499
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:57,440
subtle, come on. His core claim in that segment is that capitalism caused a miracle that rebuilt

500
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,960
Europe after World War II, implying that what happened was some sort of miracle of the free market.

501
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,520
That couldn't be further from the truth. What happened after the war is that much of Europe

502
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:14,800
was destroyed while the USA, due to its geographic position, came out not just unscathed, but with

503
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:21,120
a booming economy. So Western European countries, along with others such as Japan and South Korea,

504
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:26,880
were absolutely desperate to rebuild. And the USA was the only game in town, since they obviously

505
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,800
wouldn't have let them seek help from the USSR, even if they wanted to. The US used this monopoly to

506
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,240
create the Marshall Plan and other adjacent initiatives, which gave aid to those countries.

507
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:44,080
The catch was that this money could only be used to buy resources, such as food and building

508
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:50,720
materials, from sources that the USA had chosen, which usually meant from the USA itself. This not

509
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,160
only meant that the money from the aid was just flowing right back to the USA anyway, but it also

510
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:02,560
allowed its exports to penetrate into Europe in a much more long-lasting fashion. All of this was

511
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:09,440
imposed by the USA on countries that were in no position to refuse. So it was an initiative conceived

512
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:15,280
by the US government, directed by them every step of the way, to give their country a functional

513
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,680
monopoly over post-war trade and ensure their influence over the aid recipients. That is how

514
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:27,840
these countries were actually rebuilt after World War II, not by the wonders of free market forces,

515
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:34,720
but by pervasive and often coercive state action. But Johnny Harris frames it as some sort of magical

516
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:41,360
free market explosion, where the magic words of capitalism and free market just caused miracles

517
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:46,480
to happen. But again, the reason that Harris can't be honest about this and just glosses over it so

518
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,240
childishly is because the thesis of this part of the video is just that free market capitalism is

519
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:58,000
super awesome, because that's what the World Economic Forum mandated conclusion needs it to be.

520
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,440
So if you acknowledge the fact that the post-World War II rebuilding of Europe was carried out under

521
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,880
just about the fervorce thing from the principles of free market capitalism imaginable, his entire

522
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,560
narrative would crumble. Harris then makes this statement. It was working so well that more and

523
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:19,360
more people started to believe that we needed to get government out of capitalism and let the market

524
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:24,720
just do its thing. This is another claim that's just contradicted by his own narrative. Everything

525
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:30,800
was just working so well after the war with embedded liberalism that this drove people to

526
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,960
want to change things by completely abandoning everything that had characterized that system

527
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:43,360
and all of its magical miracles, where only two minutes in and Harris has said something stupid,

528
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:49,200
nonsensical or contradicted himself just about every other sentence. Anyway, so this just isn't

529
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:55,920
true. Normal people, one suddenly like, ah man, this sucks. I hate being guaranteed a decent wage.

530
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,040
I hate having public health care and social welfare. I hate that corporations can't just do

531
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,360
whatever they want and that I actually have some bargaining power so they have to at least give

532
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:11,600
people like me some concessions. You know what I want? I want all of that gone. Now, the people

533
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:17,840
that were advocating for this were businessmen, executives, and their paid propagandists,

534
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:24,880
Johnny Harris's forebears, like Milton Friedman, the one singular person who he actually presents

535
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:31,760
as evidence for his idea of people wanting to just let the market do its thing. One of the major

536
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:38,160
advocates for this idea of unfettered capitalism was this guy. There has never in history been a

537
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,640
more effective machine for eliminating poverty than the free enterprise system in the free market.

538
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:49,600
A Chicago-based economist named Milton Friedman. If they fail, they bear the cost. If they succeed,

539
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,880
they get the benefit. This turn towards letting the market do its thing,

540
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:01,520
as Harris describes it, began in the early 1970s. It's called, as we went over earlier,

541
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:08,400
neoliberalism, not shareholder capitalism. And its conception actually long predates the time frame

542
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,760
that Harris seems to ascribe to it. It's public advocates who had been paid to push it from the

543
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:20,160
mid-1940s onwards by the ultra-rich via think tanks such as the Mont Pelerin Society and the

544
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:26,560
Institute of Economic Affairs had long been lobbying for a turn to neoliberalism. This advocacy was,

545
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,440
from the very beginning, in opposition to embedded liberalism and bread and woods,

546
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,400
because capitalists considered this system to be too restrictive on their interests. Not,

547
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,800
as Harris claims, the post-war period being super awesome, causing people in general to,

548
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:49,120
for some reason, just incomprehensibly decide to get rid of everything that had characterized it

549
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:55,120
and replace it with something else. The actual reasons behind this turn to neoliberalism are a

550
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:01,360
lot less savory than that. Embedded liberalism began to run into problems in the early 1970s,

551
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:07,840
and the 1973 oil crisis was the definitive nail in its coffin. Numerous prominent scholars on the

552
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:14,160
subject like David Harvey, Gerard Domeniel and Dominique Levy have concluded that the upper classes

553
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:19,440
took advantage of this chaotic situation to push for the replacement of embedded liberalism with

554
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:25,440
neoliberalism. Up until this point, neoliberalism had been little more than a fringe economic

555
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:31,520
theory pushed by their think tanks and a couple of board and paid for university economics departments

556
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,800
like Friedman's University of Chicago. But now they had a chance to make it reality,

557
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:42,320
to rapidly put it into practice. The post-war system had greatly reduced their economic power

558
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:47,920
from its pre-war levels, and they wanted it back. Neoliberalism in practice was first

559
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:53,760
implemented via imperialism. The USA backed a bloody military coup in Chile, where an elected

560
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,040
socialist government was overthrown via military coup and replaced with a neoliberal military

561
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:05,280
dictatorship. Economists trained at the aforementioned corporate funded Chicago School of Economics

562
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:10,480
by the same Milton Friedman who Johnny Harris uncritically presents as some sort of genius,

563
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,280
were shipped in from the US to dictate the direction of social and economic policy.

564
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,920
They took on massive foreign debt via loans from the International Monetary Fund,

565
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,440
opened up natural resources to unregulated corporate exploitation, privatized swaths of

566
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:31,200
public assets, abolished or privatized public services and social welfare, and opened up the

567
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:37,360
economy to the free market exploitation of foreign companies. Chile, along with other violently

568
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:44,160
imposed US-backed neoliberal experiments of the early to mid-70s, was used as something of a lab

569
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,480
to see whether neoliberalism would really work in practice in the way that the rich

570
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,040
had hoped it would. Economic inequality skyrocketed practically immediately.

571
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:58,000
Wealth was redistributed very effectively from Chile's working class to the richest segments

572
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,480
as well as to the rich of other countries. So the experiment proved a resounding success at its

573
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:10,880
aim of redistributing wealth and power back to the rich, which inspired implementations of the same

574
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:17,520
in the West itself. Margaret Thatcher subsequently took power in 1979 in the UK on a neoliberal

575
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:24,080
platform, while Ronald Reagan became president of the US in 1981. Reagan's economic policy was

576
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:30,560
written for him directly by the Heritage Foundation, a corporate funded think tank founded by

577
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:35,360
conservative businessmen to promote neoliberalism in the wake of the collapse of the bread and

578
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:40,320
wood system. Like literally, they founded it a year or two later. They clearly saw the blood in

579
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:45,600
the water and were ready to pounce. The results from Chile were then reproduced in those countries.

580
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:52,560
The share of national income of the top 0.1% of the population in the US and the UK had been falling

581
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:58,640
throughout the entire post-war period and reached its lowest level in history around 1978,

582
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:04,240
right before the Thatcher and Reagan era began. In the following two decades as neoliberal policies

583
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:12,800
were implemented, the trend shifted. Their income share in the UK rose from 1% to 3.5% by 1998 and

584
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:19,440
2% to 6% in the US. In the latter case, this rivaled the levels of wealth and power held by the

585
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,520
ultra-rich during parts of the Great Depression. This was concurrent with a massive fall in real

586
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:31,360
wages, meaning average worker wages adjusted for inflation for the purposes of being able

587
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:37,360
to compare wages at different times. Real wages in the US had grown substantially all throughout

588
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:42,880
the bread and woods period, then fell slightly due to the oil crisis in the mid-1970s before

589
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,960
stabilizing and rising again. They then completely dropped off a cliff once Reagan introduced neoliberalism

590
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:56,800
in the 1980s and by the year 2000 had only just managed to recover to 1966 levels. Even today,

591
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:02,400
real wages in the US are stagnant and are still only around the same level they were in the late

592
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,320
60s. This all happened while GDP growth and increases in productivity levels remain the

593
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:14,240
same as before. Throughout the bread and woods period, wages increased as the economy grew,

594
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:20,480
while in the neoliberal period, wages started decreasing, becoming decoupled from economic

595
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:26,320
growth. This means that what neoliberalism actually achieved wasn't the prosperity that Harris

596
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:32,320
nauseatingly repeats it did throughout the video, but rather it ensured little more than that huge

597
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:37,920
shares of income that previously were going to workers would go to the rich instead. I'm getting

598
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,280
ahead of myself a bit here because what I just said actually also contradicts large parts of

599
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,160
Harris's narrative that we haven't even gotten around to yet, including the very next sentence

600
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:54,080
that he utters. Now, let's contrast the reality of the neoliberal turn that I just went over with

601
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:59,280
Harris's own explanation for it. More and more people started to believe that we needed to get

602
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,960
government out of capitalism and let the market just do its thing. Now yes, I know that's just a

603
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,840
short summary and that's not the problem here. The problem is that it's just completely wrong

604
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:15,200
and that even for a short summary, it simplified down to a kindergarten propaganda level.

605
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,760
Capitalism was awesome and magic, so people decided that they wanted the government out of

606
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,440
capitalism and that's how we got neoliberalism. I genuinely am kind of worried that there seems

607
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:31,200
to be many grown adults out there who this sort of thing works on. Harris then does the whole

608
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:36,880
world economic forum thing of obscuring neoliberalism by claiming that it's actually shareholder

609
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,960
capitalism, you know, the stuff that we just went over. Since we've already gone over that,

610
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:46,560
I'm going to skip ahead about 30 seconds to where he argues that Milton Friedman was right

611
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:52,720
because neoliberalism, according to him, actually did work really well. And his proof for this is

612
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:58,880
a graph of raw GDP per capita in the USA. And if you look at the data in the United States and the

613
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:05,360
West, Milton Friedman sort of had a point. Now, first off, I already kind of refuted the argument

614
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:11,280
that he's making here by showing that after neoliberal reforms in the US, GDP and productivity

615
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:17,840
continued to rise at the same rates as before, but real wages dropped. But even if GDP per capita

616
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:23,120
had actually been growing at a higher rate than before during the neoliberal period, as he claims,

617
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:29,680
the massive drop in real wages would indicate that this increased growth was just going straight

618
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:34,720
into the pockets of the ultra rich, while normal people were just getting poorer and poorer every

619
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:41,120
year. This is demonstrative of how GDP and GDP per capita are usually not at all useful measures

620
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:46,880
of anything actually indicative of living standards on their own. But even if we do ignore all of the

621
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,960
more relevant metrics aside from GDP per capita that show that neoliberalism hasn't actually been

622
00:57:52,960 --> 00:58:00,080
good at all for anyone but the rich, even by Harris's own measure, he's wrong. Since 1870,

623
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:06,320
real GDP per capita in the USA has grown at a steady rate overall, so much so that its trend

624
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:11,120
can be charted by a straight line. The growth rate had already recovered to the average rate

625
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:17,680
throughout US history of around 2% per year. So neoliberalism didn't actually even make the US

626
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:23,600
economy grow any faster. The growth of the neoliberal period is rather exactly on trend,

627
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:28,480
with the average rate of growth throughout US history. All up, the growth of the period of

628
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:35,040
embedded liberalism from 1950 to 1980, where GDP per capita nearly doubled, was actually higher

629
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:40,880
than the growth from the 30 year period after Reagan brought neoliberalism to the US from 1981

630
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:48,000
to 2011, where it only increased by 65%. By starting his graph in 1960 and using simple

631
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,200
raw GDP per capita figures, Harris obfuscates this. Though this was probably unintentional and just

632
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:58,880
the result of him not being good at research, because the first result on Google for USA GDP per

633
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:06,240
capita is a graph from the World Bank, which his animation lines up with exactly. The reason why his

634
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:12,320
graph has that rather flat curve during the Bretton Woods era that makes it look like neoliberalism

635
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:18,240
increased GDP per capita at a higher relative rate afterwards is because this graph is of GDP per

636
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:25,120
capita in current US dollars, meaning not adjusted for inflation. So the seemingly flatline growth

637
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:31,920
in the 1960s in Harris's graph is an illusion. Inflation was low and stable, and then it skyrocketed

638
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:37,360
in the 70s and 80s. Even though this money was worth significantly less relatively, as prices

639
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:43,120
had greatly increased, the raw GDP per capita number nonetheless still went up as a result.

640
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:48,400
On Harris's GDP per capita graph, this makes it look like economic growth had shot up from a

641
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:54,240
rather stagnant curve into a straight line, when in reality it was a straight line the whole time.

642
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,200
Constant US dollar graphs, like the one that I cited, are adjusted for inflation,

643
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:05,600
and the World Bank website, which is where Harris pulled his graph from, also has their own constant

644
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:11,920
US dollar graph. It's just not the first result on Google. As you can see, it tells quite a different

645
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:18,160
story from the one that he used. So, this is the first actual source that Harris tries to present

646
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:23,440
in this video. Three minutes in, after having already made a ton of claims that were just screaming

647
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,240
out to be sourced. It is the first result from Google, and it doesn't actually prove what Harris

648
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:33,600
claims it does. The opposite is actually true, because inflation adjusted versions of this graph

649
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:40,240
disprove his claim that Milton Friedman was right, as GDP per capita did not actually grow any faster

650
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:46,720
after neoliberal reforms. On top of that, GDP per capita used as the only metric here to argue that

651
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:51,680
neoliberal policies were making things better would hardly be enough to prove his claim anyway,

652
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:56,240
even if the data was actually on his side, since that says absolutely nothing about how that

653
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:01,840
income is actually distributed. As you can see, on the odd occasion where Harris does bother to

654
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:07,360
try and source a claim, it can go pretty catastrophically. Harris continues on from here.

655
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:14,160
And it led to huge prosperity in the West, as the US economy exploded.

656
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:21,360
No, the US economy did not explode, and it did not lead to huge prosperity. The economy grew

657
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:26,080
at the average historical rate, yet the average person started receiving less of that growth,

658
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:33,040
proven by real wages falling dramatically, while bottom 50% income share also took a huge nosedive.

659
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:40,000
In my book, personally, that's the exact opposite of huge prosperity. Luckily for him though,

660
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,720
Johnny Harris is not beholden to things like actually presenting evidence for his claims,

661
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:49,840
so he can just say whatever he wants and then move on, treating it as if it's true just because he

662
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:54,160
said it, which is exactly what he does throughout the entire video and throughout pretty much all

663
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:59,440
of his videos. Wait a minute, but what about China? Are we talking about China and its economy,

664
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,480
you know, the Middle Kingdom, China? So all the US and Western economies are thriving because of this

665
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:10,000
corporate free market capitalism that was taking over the world. Okay, so we're finally back to

666
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:16,320
China, and he prefaces this segment by again confidently stating that the West was thriving

667
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:22,320
thanks to corporate free market capitalism. It's like he's trying to wheel his version of history

668
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:26,800
into existence by just repeating it over and over. We've already established that this just

669
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:31,280
isn't true. What's interesting about those statements to me is the taking over the world

670
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:36,320
part because neoliberalism was bad for workers in the West, but it was even worse for people

671
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:42,000
elsewhere in the world. By focusing so much on the West, Harris misses the forest for the trees.

672
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,280
While neoliberals came to power via elections in much of the Western world, neoliberalism was

673
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:52,720
imposed by usually US-backed dictatorships in other places. As David Harvey wrote,

674
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:58,160
How was neoliberalization accomplished and by whom? The answer in countries such as Chile

675
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:04,720
and Argentina in the 1970s was as simple as it was swift, brutal, and sure. A military coup

676
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:09,760
backed by the traditional upper classes as well as by the US government, followed by the fierce

677
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,720
repression of all solidarities created within the labor and urban social movements which had

678
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:20,320
so threatened their power. So the neoliberal turn for the rest of the world went even worse,

679
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:27,520
while the Americans, Brits, French, Australians, etc. were merely misled into voting for neoliberalism.

680
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:33,040
For many others outside of the West and outside of the global North, the turn was much more violent,

681
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:38,960
being instituted by usually US-backed dictatorships or through coercive loans from international

682
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:44,960
institutions, aka front organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, with conditions that

683
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:50,800
forced the recipients to adopt neoliberal reforms. Many of the countries who received these loans,

684
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:55,600
such as Mozambique, had only recently gained independence from colonial rule and were in

685
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:01,040
a similar situation to what Europe was in after World War II, in desperate needs of funds to

686
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:06,480
rebuild. So they simply had no other choice. The same policies were implemented in these countries

687
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:13,760
as in Chile, the US, and UK with similar effects. Increases in the income share of the rich and

688
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:19,760
decreases in the income share of everyone else. But in that case, neoliberalism fostered not just

689
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:25,520
the redistribution of wealth from workers to local rich people, but also from workers to

690
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:32,720
capitalists in the West, and particularly the US. Now, let's finally see what Harris has to say

691
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:38,320
about China. So while the US and Western economies are thriving because of this corporate free market

692
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:44,400
capitalism that was taking over the world, China was descending further and further into decline.

693
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,800
Instead of joining the capitalism party that the West was spreading throughout the world,

694
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:56,720
China resisted, turning to a one-party rule communist system, headed by this guy, Mao Zedong,

695
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:02,720
who destroyed any chance of China's economy ever joining the prosperity happening around the world.

696
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:09,600
By the 1970s, China was a place of widespread poverty, the once prosperous kingdom had reached

697
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:15,920
rock bottom. This part is really something. So the West was apparently prospering due to

698
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:21,120
corporate free market capitalism, right? And it was spreading this around the world,

699
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:25,520
just kind of out of the goodness of its heart. They just wanted everyone else to enjoy free

700
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:31,040
market capitalism too. But unfortunately, China was ruled by Mao and the communists,

701
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:36,560
who were just too stupid and evil to press the big red button marked prosperity and join this

702
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:42,880
capitalism party. Instead of joining this feisty fiesta, they decided to instead press the poverty

703
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:49,680
button, and then they hit rock bottom as a result. This is the most generic, propagandistic rhetoric

704
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:55,920
imaginable. It's precisely how American propaganda has always framed its enemies. Their actions simply

705
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:01,520
can't be explained in any way, but by them being innately evil. Because who in their right mind

706
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:07,200
would oppose the freedom and prosperity that we so generously want to bring them? The entire recent

707
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:13,760
history of China, like, you know, colonialism and war, which had left the country in destitute poverty

708
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,800
long before the communists had ever taken power, is glossed over in order to make it seem like

709
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:23,920
there was no possible rational explanation for why China might have been a bit skeptical of the

710
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:29,840
western capitalism. Rather, China just had two buttons. One that said good things, and one that

711
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:36,320
said bad things. And they pressed the latter because Mao is evil and hates prosperity. A vague,

712
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:42,240
undefined, positive sounding term that Harris repeats throughout the video to signal to the

713
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:47,440
audience when they're supposed to like or dislike something. The implication of this is that any

714
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,640
country that's poor is poor simply because its leaders want it to be. For Johnny Harris,

715
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:57,840
things need to be this simple, because his video is a propaganda piece made on behalf of the world's

716
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:02,720
worst billionaires. It's best for him to be uncritical and unthinking and just try to win the

717
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:08,480
viewer over with sophistry, because basic things like evidence and rudimentary logic aren't on

718
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:14,160
his side. There's three other things that I want to address about this part. One, Mao was in power

719
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:21,760
from 1949 to 1976, entirely during the embedded liberalism period, which as we've already gone

720
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:28,480
over, was not characterized by corporate free market capitalism. So if there was prosperity in

721
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:34,240
the west during this time, it was due to something quite different than that. Harris once again screws

722
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:41,040
up his chronology for like the 20th time in this video. Two, Harris refers to the Cold War period,

723
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:46,800
in which the west was aggressively spreading capitalism throughout the world as the capitalism

724
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:52,000
party, as if this was something altruistic and as if every other country was free to just copy

725
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,840
what they were doing and was positioned to be able to do so. This was anything but the case. The vast

726
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:03,520
majority of countries at this time had no industrial base whatsoever from which to build such a system

727
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:08,880
off, let alone one nearly as advanced as it was in most western countries. Many of them were also

728
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:15,360
still colonies or recently liberated former colonies. Most were also overwhelmingly agrarian,

729
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:21,600
with populations made up mostly of peasants and economies based around primary products like raw

730
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:27,600
resources or agricultural goods. In short, they were really in no position to just copy what the

731
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:33,040
richest countries were doing at the time one to one. They needed to industrialize from scratch,

732
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:38,320
but the west wouldn't let them. The U.S. in particular very aggressively prevented other

733
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:43,280
countries from replicating anything resembling the policies that characterized the embedded

734
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:49,200
liberalism era, like the regulation of markets, controls on capital flows, and forcing companies

735
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:54,880
to compromise with workers. Those sorts of policies were reserved for themselves and their allies only.

736
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:59,840
When other poor countries tried to industrialize in much the same ways that they had, tried to

737
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:04,560
regulate the ability of foreign countries to extract their resources, or did pretty much

738
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:10,320
anything aimed at curbing the power of corporations to better conditions for normal people, the USA

739
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:16,480
and their allies would step in to try and stop or at least impede their progress. Guatemala,

740
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:22,400
Indonesia, and Iran are just free examples out of the many countries they targeted that were

741
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:27,920
trying to pursue regulated capitalist paths to development because that was inconvenient for

742
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,320
the profit of the west. So they intervened to ensure that they were violently stopped from

743
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:38,240
doing so, with at least hundreds of thousands of people being killed as a result. So there was no

744
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:43,680
capitalism party that was just open to be joined. Harris' characterization of events is not just

745
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:49,360
simplified, it is outright wrong and intentionally misleading propaganda. At least I hope it is

746
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:54,160
because I really hope that he's not this dumb. He needs to have a simplistic villain who solely

747
01:09:54,160 --> 01:10:00,240
threw their own personal, irrational evil, prevented China from joining the good guys and doing

748
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:06,240
capitalism to become prosperous because the reality casts this supposed party of free market

749
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:13,280
capitalism in a much less flattering light. Free. The Maoist period in China was definitely

750
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:19,520
not rock bottom. Living standards actually improved greatly during it and the overall economy expanded

751
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:25,040
at a decent, steady rate, even despite major catastrophes like the Great Leap Forward. GDP

752
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:30,640
per capita grew by about 2% per year, which is not incredible or anything, but still better than

753
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:35,440
before, and around the same as the average growth rate of the US economy throughout its history.

754
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:40,000
This economic growth data also has to be considered with the caveat that the Chinese economy at the

755
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,720
time was run fundamentally differently. Its income was allocated more equally and it had

756
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:50,240
provisions for basic needs that GDP, designed to measure economic activity in a market economy,

757
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:56,320
can fail to account for. GDP is already a highly imperfect way of measuring production even in

758
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:02,560
a capitalist country. In a socialist and largely agrarian, non-market one, it's even less useful.

759
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:08,400
More direct indicators of living standards are much more useful. By 1978, peasants were earning

760
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:14,160
more than double the raw income they had earned in 1954, a trend confirmed by its replication

761
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:19,440
across multiple different data sets and metrics. Raw income among the urban population doubled

762
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:24,240
as well. This is also corroborated by the doubling of real expenditure per individual,

763
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:30,080
meaning how much money the average individual person was spending per year adjusted for inflation.

764
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,960
The purchasing power of the average person doubling in less than 30 years is at least

765
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:41,600
a half decent increase in prosperity, in my opinion. Daily caloric intake increased. Life

766
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:49,840
expectancy shot up very rapidly, rising from 40 in 1953 to 65 in 1978. Infant mortality dropped

767
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:57,600
from 175 deaths per 1,000 births to 37 per 1,000. Access to education was greatly expanded,

768
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:05,840
with primary school enrollment rates increasing from 48% in 1952 to 94% in 1978. Literacy rates

769
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:11,680
also correspondingly increased rapidly. So, contrary to Harris' fairytale narrative of

770
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:17,040
there just being a big bad man who hated good things for no apparent reason, the Communist

771
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:24,080
Party at the time both wanted to make China more prosperous and did so. Assuming here that prosperity

772
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,960
means living standards improving, Harris never actually tells us what he means by that word,

773
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:34,800
so I'm kind of guessing. And it certainly wasn't anywhere near rock bottom, especially not compared

774
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,760
to the previous hundred years or so, which were full of war and colonization, much of it at the

775
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:45,680
hands of these same Western capitalist countries that Harris spends most of his video praising.

776
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:52,880
I also want to note that the photos that Harris uses here are not actually of the 1970s as he claims,

777
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:58,880
but rather from the 1900s to the 1940s. They're squarely from the period of nationalist, aka

778
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:04,720
Western-aligned, rule. It seems like he went looking for photos of poverty from the 1970s to

779
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:09,760
back up his argument, but wasn't able to find them, so decided to instead present photos from

780
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:15,680
before the Communist ever came to power as evidence of them being bad. Kind of slimy, dude.

781
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:22,000
Next, Harris moves on to China's market reforms in the late 1970s under Deng Xiaoping,

782
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:26,800
because the entire point of him even talking about the Mao era was just to make it sound as

783
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:31,840
horrible and illogical and evil as possible, to then frame everything that followed it as even

784
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:36,400
more amazing in comparison. The worse that he can make the former sound, the better the latter

785
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:42,240
sounds in contrast, helping with the overarching, childish, uncritical celebration of free market

786
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:47,760
capitalism as some sort of magic narrative of the video. The once prosperous kingdom

787
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,200
had reached rock bottom, but that was all about to change.

788
01:13:54,480 --> 01:14:02,000
So it's the 1970s and this is China's new leader, Deng Xiaoping. He came into power hoping to turn

789
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:09,680
around this 150 years of humiliation in China, the decline of China as a superpower. Elsewhere in the

790
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:16,080
region, China's neighbors had economies that joined the global economic party that was happening

791
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:22,880
in capitalism and they were thriving. They saw immense economic miracles and pulled millions

792
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:28,480
out of poverty. Really all he does is just make statements and then use positive sounding adjectives

793
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:34,080
to tell the audience what they're supposed to think and feel. Thriving economic miracles.

794
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:38,880
The reality of what happened in these countries is nowhere near as simplistic as Harris needed to

795
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:44,640
be for his propaganda to work. Singapore and Hong Kong, for example, are tiny city-states.

796
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:50,080
Used as hubs for global finance and trade due to their unique status as separate jurisdictions

797
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,880
from much larger neighboring countries. And they only even came to have this status in the first

798
01:14:54,880 --> 01:15:00,000
place due to unique historical circumstances related to colonialism. That's not something that

799
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,960
can at all be replicated in the vast majority of countries, let alone a massive one like China.

800
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:10,480
And whether replicating it would even be desirable at all is also very questionable. Given that Hong

801
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:15,440
Kong, despite its very high levels of gross wealth, has one of the worst poverty rates in the

802
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:20,400
entire global north and hundreds of thousands of people who live in what are basically cages

803
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:25,200
because they can't afford anything else. Singapore is also hardly a model of the

804
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:30,720
corporate free market capitalism that Harris is trying to promote. Singapore is widely considered

805
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:36,160
in the academic literature to have developed via state capitalism. A highly government-directed

806
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:41,040
form of capitalism with considerable state control and ownership of important sectors

807
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:46,320
of the economy. They directed economic policy and leveraged state power at every step of the

808
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:51,840
way, which resulted in the government being the most important economic actor in the country by far.

809
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:57,440
This has resulted in an economy where, quoting a paper on the matter, the shareholder-centric

810
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:04,320
corporation virtually does not exist and where the state owns 37% of the stock market capitalization,

811
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:11,040
95% of the land, 80% of the housing, etc. Quite contrary to Harris's notion of

812
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:16,800
shareholder capitalism having created prosperity. Of the other countries that Harris points to,

813
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:23,040
the three most worth looking at are Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Due to the context of the Cold

814
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:28,160
War and the end of World War II, the USA attempted to bring all of these countries under its hegemony

815
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:32,880
by providing them with considerable economic aid like it had with the Marshall Plan in Western

816
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:38,240
Europe. Because of this, they were able to pursue levels of state economic intervention and planning

817
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:43,280
that weren't nearly as tolerated in countries not aligned with the West. And this state direction

818
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:49,040
was pervasive, especially in Taiwan and South Korea, which were ruled by outright military

819
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:54,800
dictatorships all the way up until the late 80s and early 90s. South Korea had straight up,

820
01:16:54,800 --> 01:17:02,240
actual five-year plans inspired by the USSR all the way up until the 1990s, painting their economic

821
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:08,160
growth as due to the simple wonders of free market capitalism is very misleading. Economist

822
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:14,480
Ha Jun Chang commented on the common misconception that these countries followed mainstream free

823
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:19,920
market style policies. Many of the things that the East Asian government officials did in the

824
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:25,120
miracle years, protecting infant industries, forcefully mobilizing resources away from

825
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:30,560
technologically stagnant agriculture into the dynamic industrial sector, and exploiting the

826
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:36,480
linkages across different sectors, contradict the free market view. Had the East Asian countries,

827
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:41,360
and indeed most of the rich countries in Europe and North America before them, run their economies

828
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:45,520
according to the principles of free market economics, they would not have developed their

829
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:50,640
economies in the way they have. All of this is especially true of the period that Harris is

830
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:55,840
covering here. These countries did eventually adopt neoliberal dogma in the 80s and 90s,

831
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:59,680
dialing back the state intervention that had characterized their economies throughout the

832
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:06,560
50s, 60s, and 70s. But the Chinese government's market reforms happened in the 1970s, so clearly

833
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:12,640
they were not inspired by what he calls corporate free market capitalism in East Asia because it

834
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:17,360
didn't exist there yet. I've said this already but it's worth repeating. Harris's content,

835
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:22,880
and indeed a lot of other content on YouTube, relies a whole lot on just confidently stating

836
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:27,840
things that aren't true as if they are. Without even trying to actually substantiate these claims

837
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,960
either, they're acting like the point has been proven regardless, and moving on to making another

838
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:38,160
fundamentally incorrect statement that also rests on the previous one, and all of the others

839
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:44,320
before that, having been true. So his whole narrative here of free market capitalist prosperity

840
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:48,400
has been crafted on a very, very long chain of falsehoods.

841
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:56,080
Deng specifically went on a visit to Singapore early on in his term, where ethnic Chinese had

842
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:02,480
adopted the free market, and they were thriving. He felt inspired. The malice economic doctrine

843
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:08,480
that had failed was over, and it was time to see if China could rebuild its economy,

844
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:14,720
experimenting with some version of capitalism. People didn't adopt the free market. That's

845
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:19,680
not how this works. You can't just individually decide that you want to do free market capitalism.

846
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:24,000
No more than I can just individually decide that I want to do communism. These are overarching

847
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,520
socioeconomic systems, not individual choices. These people lived under capitalism not because

848
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,680
they had adopted it, but rather just because they happened to live in a capitalist society.

849
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:38,960
But yeah, we've already been over what Singapore actually is and was, which conflicts greatly with

850
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:43,920
Harris's narrative here. What do you think it was that Chinese government officials may have seen

851
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:48,400
when they visited Singapore? That Chinese people are capable of running businesses,

852
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:52,960
like they have some sort of essential business running essence or something that they want to

853
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:59,280
wear off before, or a state-led economy that they might have been able to learn something from

854
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:04,240
for their own state-led economic reforms in their country? You don't need to think about it very

855
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:09,600
hard to arrive at the latter conclusion, because the first option is kind of ridiculous, and that

856
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:14,560
is in fact the case. The Communist Party came to see Singapore as something of a reference,

857
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:20,320
precisely because it was an example of an already existing model in which the state remained economically

858
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:26,560
dominant. But apart from that, Harris's timeline is again just totally messed up. Deng visited

859
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:33,040
Singapore in 1978, the same year in which the economic reforms in China began, but he and other

860
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:38,720
Chinese officials didn't start to promote Singapore as a special model to be followed in China

861
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:43,920
until 1992. Before that, it was just one of many different places that they'd studied,

862
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:49,840
so their decision to begin market reforms itself has really nothing to do with Singapore. For Harris,

863
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:55,040
though, it's very convenient to reduce a complicated, multi-causal decision, one which was

864
01:20:55,040 --> 01:21:00,320
itself the result of power struggles in the Communist Party, to a simple Eureka-style moment

865
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:06,720
of epiphany. After decades of the evil Mao denying his people prosperity, along with other positive

866
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:12,880
sounding nouns, Deng saw the glory of the free market firsthand in Singapore, and he was so

867
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:18,400
awed by its incredible greatness that he had no choice but to go home and immediately replicate

868
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:24,400
it. It comes off as a childish, apocryphal propaganda story because it is one. In reality,

869
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:29,520
the reforms were already underway beforehand, the visit to Singapore was very short and uneventful,

870
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:34,240
the Chinese government only started paying special attention to Singapore 14 years later,

871
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:39,200
and the reason they did so didn't actually have much to do with free market capitalism at all,

872
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:45,120
rather something quite antifical to it. China's turn to a market-based but still state-dictated

873
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:50,480
economy has infinitely more to do with other factors, like the aforementioned political conflicts,

874
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:55,280
chiefly among them the one of the Soviet Union. So yeah, firstly, there was that,

875
01:21:55,280 --> 01:22:01,440
which led to China and the USA establishing diplomatic relations again in 1972. Before this,

876
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:07,040
the People's Republic of China had no access to international governance systems like the UN,

877
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:11,280
as they were mostly controlled by the West, who had still considered the Republic of China

878
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:16,640
government in Taiwan as the legitimate government of all of China. So suddenly, all of the world's

879
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:22,160
most important and richest markets, made up of many countries who had spent the previous century

880
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:28,080
colonizing China and most of the rest of the world, were now finally open to China. This was a drastic

881
01:22:28,160 --> 01:22:33,120
and sudden change in circumstances that enabled options that were previously closed to them,

882
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:38,160
like foreign investment from the advanced capitalist countries and the ability to export to them.

883
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:43,840
Second, Deng Xiaoping had been inspired by the new economic policy of the Soviet Union.

884
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:48,560
After the Russian Revolution, the Soviet government under Lenin decided that because

885
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:54,320
the country was overwhelmingly agrarian, much like China was, that they would allow a state-directed

886
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:59,040
capitalism in the hopes of developing an advanced industrial capitalist society,

887
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:03,920
because Karl Marx had theorized that that would be something of a prerequisite for communism.

888
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:09,440
This was highly successful, as the USSR rapidly recovered from the devastation of its civil war

889
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:15,600
and World War I. In 1961, following the disastrous attempt at rapid industrialization known as the

890
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:21,840
Great Leap Forward, Deng was then already the key player in an ill-fated attempt to implement

891
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:27,120
NEP-style reforms in China, to industrialize China in a very different way to the one that Mao

892
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:33,520
had just tried. So the idea before the market reforms that he started to implement in 1978

893
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:38,560
was not actually new at all, not in the history of China, nor in the history of communism,

894
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:44,160
nor even in Deng's own political career. So the international conditions that enabled China's

895
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:50,400
market reforms only came to be in the 1970s, and that clearest precedent and inspiration didn't

896
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:57,040
come from the West in the 1970s, but from the East in the 1920s, and they had been proposed in China

897
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:02,800
since at least the 1960s. If it isn't already clear from everything that we've just gone over,

898
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:08,960
Harris' narrative of China joining the capitalist party in the West is also just plain chronologically

899
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:15,600
impossible. He clearly means to imply that China was inspired by free markets, neoliberal capitalism,

900
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:20,320
rather than the embedded liberalism of the Bretton Woods period, given his constant references to

901
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:25,440
arch neoliberal Milton Friedman, his earlier delineation between the Bretton Woods period

902
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:30,320
and the neoliberal period that came after, and the fact that he outright praises free market

903
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:35,760
capitalism like a dozen times, actually more than that. But China's reforms actually started

904
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:42,880
before the turn to neoliberalism in the West. They started in 1978. Thatcher was elected in 1979,

905
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:48,560
Reagan in 1981, so they couldn't have been inspired by Friedman-style neoliberal reforms there,

906
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:53,360
because they hadn't even been implemented on a national level yet. In this video, it really

907
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:58,800
seems like Harris has like an uncontrollable desire to use the term West as synonymous with

908
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:03,920
correct and good. His presentation of the world is one where it's just kind of self-evident,

909
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:09,520
that the only way forward is to copy the superior West. If something happened that he considers to

910
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:14,800
be good, he does everything possible to ultimately credit it to Western influences or inspirations,

911
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:19,440
without feeling any sort of need to actually back that up, or check whether his argument even

912
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:23,840
makes any chronological sense, or consider the possibility that Chinese people might be

913
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:29,280
capable of thinking for themselves, having their own ideas, or being inspired by anything other

914
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:34,160
than the same countries that had colonized and devastated their own. This is juxtaposed with

915
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:38,800
his treatment of Mao, who was apparently just completely irrational and evil, because that's

916
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:44,000
the only way that Harris can apparently think of that could possibly explain someone not simply

917
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:49,600
copying the superior West. It comes off as at least a little bit racist. In the next bit,

918
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:55,360
Harris reduces all of Deng's market reforms to just him focusing on one little village,

919
01:25:55,360 --> 01:26:00,480
the special economic zone of Shenzhen. He frames it like Deng started out by creating a little

920
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:05,760
secret capitalist project, developing this one town into a bustling industrial city. But the

921
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:11,280
reality is that this was just one small part of a much wider reform program, which also included

922
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:15,920
free other special economic zones established in free other places at the same time. So why

923
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:22,400
does he focus on it so heavily? This remark makes it clear. Deng Xiaoping designated this little town

924
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:29,680
as quote a special economic zone, where foreign companies could set up and invest in a very

925
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:35,360
capitalistic free market, claiming China's highly regulated very state directed system,

926
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:40,480
as some sort of success of free market capitalism would obviously be ridiculous. So in an attempt

927
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:46,240
to get around this complication, Harris, providing no evidence for his claims at all, says that Shenzhen

928
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:50,560
had a free market, and then he just casually acts like that represented the rest of China,

929
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:55,040
and that it was replicated everywhere else. Despite having done absolutely nothing to even

930
01:26:55,040 --> 01:27:00,880
remotely argue for or evidence this extremely false claim, he then uses it as the basis to

931
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:06,800
claim China as a whole as a victory of the same type of free market capitalism that Milton Friedman

932
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:12,720
This starts happening all over China, and meanwhile Milton Friedman's back in the U.S. being like

933
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:21,840
Yep. Told ya. Soon there were a bunch of cities designated in China for special economic activity

934
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:26,880
or basically capitalism in a socialist country. Something I haven't mentioned yet is that big

935
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:31,280
parts of his narrative here are just ripped straight from the World Economic Forum propaganda

936
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:35,760
book that is being paid to promote here. I've actually been giving Harris way too much credit.

937
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:39,840
He didn't come up with like half of this stuff himself. The Singapore story,

938
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:45,040
followed immediately by the Shenzhen story, comes straight from the book, but Harris actually went

939
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:50,000
even further than the book did. Its description of China's special economic zones is simply that

940
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,560
there are places where foreign companies were allowed to operate with some tax incentives

941
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:59,520
under government-imposed conditions in contrast to the rest of the country where such enterprises

942
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:05,440
were entirely illegal, a surprisingly accurate description, and far from free market capitalism.

943
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:10,160
Sometimes you can just refer back to the very book that he's advertising here and use it to

944
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:16,000
refute him. Anyway, so onto the Milton Friedman part. Friedman absolutely did not approve of

945
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,240
China's state-led economy. He certainly may have liked it more than what it had before,

946
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:25,760
but it was far from anything close to resembling his neoliberal ideal. We have direct evidence of

947
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:30,640
this because Friedman actually went to China and spoke with Communist Party officials who outright

948
01:28:30,640 --> 01:28:35,120
argued against him about the very fundamentals of his beliefs. They had major disagreements

949
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:39,680
on topics like private property rights, state interference in the market, and state economic

950
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:45,440
planning. If anything, China proved Friedman wrong that the sort of government interference that he

951
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:50,960
so despised could achieve what he'd claimed it couldn't, but Harris, undeterred by the truth,

952
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:56,080
just inverts reality yet again and claims the exact opposite. One of the things you might have noticed

953
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:00,960
that Harris does a lot in this video is to muddy the distinction between different types of capitalism,

954
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:06,000
ironically while also trying to create his own distinction between different types of capitalism.

955
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:12,000
His video is very overtly pro-free market capitalism specifically, yet in one sentence

956
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,200
he'll talk about how great the free market is, and then in the next he'll just say capitalism

957
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:22,400
alone. And this last bit about China is where this muddying of the waters came to its head.

958
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:27,840
China has obviously never had anything resembling free market capitalism. Harris pays a tiny little

959
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:38,080
bit of lip service to this fact for like a second, then just forgets that he ever said that and

960
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:43,520
immediately continues on as if China is nonetheless an example of the free market dogma that is trying

961
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:48,160
to promote. It's the same thing that he did earlier when he claimed the Bretton Woods period

962
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:53,280
and the Marshall Plan as examples of miracles of the free market rather than the heavy state

963
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:58,800
economic interference, planning, and control that actually characterizes them. Johnny Harris

964
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,680
in the corporations that the World Economic Forum represents probably wouldn't be very happy if we

965
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:08,880
went and looked at the actual reality of China's state-led economy with fairly routine executions

966
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:13,840
of billionaires and took it as a model to be followed, yet such is capitalist propaganda,

967
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:19,360
contradictory by nature. China becoming a world power through heavy state intervention and very

968
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:24,560
directed and deliberate government-led economic policy doesn't fit into their narrative of what

969
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:29,040
kind of economic policies are supposed to work best, so they need to obfuscate those facts and

970
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:33,920
find roundabout ways to claim that it's actually still somehow an example of the wonders of free

971
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:39,760
market capitalism. This video is a fine example of that practice. But wait, I haven't yet actually

972
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:44,640
provided any evidence for my claim that China doesn't have a free market economy. Silly me,

973
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:50,000
allow me to cite a source, a book called Stakeholder Capitalism, by the founder and head

974
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:56,560
of the World Economic Forum. In recent decades, another form of capitalism emerged as an alternative,

975
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:02,480
state capitalism. In China, to take the most notable example, the private sector now produces

976
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:08,240
more than 60% of GDP. Despite this, the state is still considered the most important stakeholder

977
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:12,880
and retains power over individual shareholders. The government achieves its dominant role in at

978
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:18,320
least free ways. First, it keeps a strong hand in the distribution of resources and opportunities.

979
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:23,680
Second, it can intervene in virtually any industry. And third, it can direct the economy

980
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:29,840
by means of large-scale infrastructure, research and development, education, healthcare, or housing

981
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:37,280
projects. So Harris' video is fundamentally based on this idea that China is a success of free market

982
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:43,280
capitalism, of freemanite neoliberalism, to the extent that China supposedly stands as proof

983
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:48,800
that Milton Friedman was right. Yet the book that he was paid to promote in this video says

984
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:54,240
something entirely different. That it's the prime example of something very different to the neoliberalism

985
01:31:54,240 --> 01:32:00,240
that it misleadingly calls shareholder capitalism and stakeholder capitalism. The book even gives

986
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:06,080
this state capitalism props, saying that, were it not for state capitalism, large parts of the

987
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:10,960
developing world may not have seen a major growth spurred at all. Yet Harris frames it entirely

988
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:16,400
differently, as if the free market is actually to thank for the perceived successes of state-led

989
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:21,760
interventionist economies. I don't mean to give the book any credit here, it's garbage, ghost-ridden

990
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:26,240
propaganda. It only acknowledges these things because they're undeniable, and it does so to

991
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:31,280
create this false impression of nuance so that the reader is more likely to be convinced by its main

992
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:35,760
argument that the way to fix the problems of neoliberal capitalism is with more neoliberal

993
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:41,200
capitalism, along with a nice helping of giving corporations even more power. I just think it's

994
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:45,760
telling that Harris clearly read the book, given that he both claimed to have done so, and that

995
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:51,200
parts of his video seem to come directly from it. Yet to sustain his argument that everything good

996
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:57,600
ever is all thanks to the West's amazing free market capitalism, he still has to editorialize

997
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:02,880
the World Economic Forum Propaganda Book to get rid of the parts where the book is frank about the

998
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:07,440
fact that the things that he's crediting to the wonders of Milton Friedman are actually due to

999
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:13,920
something very different. Harris's video comes off as even more of a piece of unthinking capitalist

1000
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:19,920
propaganda than the literal World Economic Forum Propaganda Book does. Now, let's move on to the

1001
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:25,120
big graph moment of the video, which comes out of nowhere after Harris is finally done lying to us

1002
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:28,800
about how neoliberal capitalism actually saved the world and made everything better

1003
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,640
contrary to what all the evidence shows.

1004
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:33,200
I have two graphs I want to show you.

1005
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:42,880
They look like this. Okay, let's look at this one first. It's called the elephant graph. Do you

1006
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:50,400
sort of see why? Let's deconstruct this graph and try to understand what this says about the

1007
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:57,040
past 30 years of the rise of China. On this axis is everyone on earth ranked by their income

1008
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:02,880
grouped into percentiles. So these people down here make an income that is the 10th percentile,

1009
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:08,400
the lowest 10% in the world, and then the 20th percentile, and so on and so on. Up to these

1010
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:12,560
people up here who are the richest in the world, they have an income that puts them in the 90th

1011
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:19,520
percentile. This axis here shows how much growth in income these people have had over the past 35

1012
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:24,480
years, basically during the heyday of shareholder capitalism and the rise of China. So you'll

1013
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:29,520
see how this plays out in just a second. Let's start plotting how much income growth each of these

1014
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:37,360
groups saw over the past 35 years. The bottom 10% saw their incomes grow by around 75%, not bad.

1015
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:42,640
These are people who live in the poorest countries who make the lowest income in the world. The 20

1016
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:50,480
to 30 percentile saw huge growth in their income, 125% and more over the past 35 years. This is like

1017
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:56,480
the new middle class in China and other Asian countries who saw huge income growth due to

1018
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:01,520
globalization. They did really well under this system. Just want to pause for a second here to

1019
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:07,120
note how Harris is again claiming China for what he calls shareholder capitalism, despite the very

1020
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:13,040
book that he's promoting calling it something very different. But then you start to get to the

1021
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:19,840
people in the 50th and 60th and 70th and 80th percentile. This is basically people who live

1022
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:26,640
in the middle class in the West. Their incomes have grown much slower, sometimes under 50%

1023
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:33,040
over the course of 35 years, which is little over 1% a year, not very much income growth.

1024
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:38,560
So did you notice the contradiction there? It's a pretty big one. Harris goes his entire video

1025
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:45,280
telling us how awesome shareholder capitalism was for the West, how it made the economy explode,

1026
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:50,880
and how it proved Milton Friedman right. But then the graph that his entire video led up to

1027
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:56,480
paints a different picture. Now it seems that things actually didn't go that great for people

1028
01:35:56,480 --> 01:36:01,680
in the West. There's no consistency in this video at all. He just contradicts himself so often.

1029
01:36:01,680 --> 01:36:05,120
And some of these people in the West have seen their incomes shrink,

1030
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:10,400
like the blue-collar workers in Detroit and the rust belt whose jobs disappeared to China.

1031
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:17,280
So so far you can sort of see why this makes sense. The people in China who benefited from this mass

1032
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:23,520
industrialization saw huge benefits. And the people here in the United States and in the West

1033
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:29,920
who saw jobs go overseas to China saw a way slower growth in their income.

1034
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:36,160
So this part is kind of ridiculous. Harris blames production moving to China for that portion of

1035
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:40,880
the graph having comparatively less growth. But as we've already established, the US economy

1036
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:45,520
continued to grow at the same average rate that it always had. And given that the income shares

1037
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:50,800
of the top percentiles saw massive increases that work on current with this, it's clear that the

1038
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:55,760
extra income from this growth was taken from them and given to the rich in their country,

1039
01:36:55,760 --> 01:37:00,080
rather than to normal people in China who are at the very bottom end of this graph,

1040
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:04,160
Harris just can't seem to help himself here. He has to find some way in which he can blame

1041
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:09,040
your woes on Chinese people, rather than the capitalists who are actually to blame because,

1042
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:14,000
well, they're paying him to make this video, aren't they? I'll let him finish his spiel on the graph now.

1043
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:31,200
get us a little bit more granular. These are the people who have the highest incomes in the world.

1044
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:36,400
Let's see how their income has grown over the past 35 years.

1045
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:44,560
You can see that their income has exploded under this system. They're seeing tripling of their

1046
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:50,400
income in the past 35 years. Now, a reminder that this is 35 years of data from every economy on

1047
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:55,680
earth. This shows everyone on the planet. So this gives us a view of who are the winners and the

1048
01:37:55,680 --> 01:38:01,920
losers of this shareholder capitalism that has globalized to Asia and around the world. The top

1049
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:09,280
1% of income earners saw the biggest benefits from this system. They are the ones who disproportionately

1050
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:13,680
benefit from shareholder capitalism and the growth of globalization.

1051
01:38:14,640 --> 01:38:19,040
Again, wait, wasn't this supposed to actually be super awesome for the West?

1052
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:23,280
So awesome that it inspired China to copy it all? He said this earlier.

1053
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:27,120
So all the US and Western economies are thriving because of this corporate,

1054
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:29,680
free market capitalism that was taking over the world.

1055
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:34,160
But his own framing of this graph is kind of contradicting that quite a bit.

1056
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:39,840
Whatever. Anyway, so you probably won't be too surprised to find that this graph is extremely

1057
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:45,920
cherry-picked. It compares income growth rate, not actual income. For an example of why this

1058
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:52,240
is not exactly very indicative of anything, let's say you make $1,000 a year and your income increases

1059
01:38:52,240 --> 01:39:00,880
by, say, 125%, like it did in this part of the graph here. Then you're now making $2,250 a year,

1060
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:08,000
$1,250 more. But if someone say from this part of the graph, which Harris claims represents

1061
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:14,880
the Western middle class, is making $50,000 a year, and this grows by only 45%, which seems much

1062
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:23,920
lower in comparison, then that income has increased to $72,500 a year, or $22,500 more, which in

1063
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:30,560
numeric terms is 18 times more than the increase in income of those in the lower percentile.

1064
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:35,760
So while that income might be growing at a slower rate, that's not really indicative of anything

1065
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:40,480
useful on its own. Those in the middle can still be getting a much larger share of raw

1066
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:45,600
global income than those at the bottom. The reason why propagandists like to use this so-called

1067
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:50,880
elephant graph, comparing income growth instead of numerical increases in income, is because the

1068
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:56,480
latter graph completely destroys the narrative that this elephant graph is used to push, that

1069
01:39:56,480 --> 01:40:01,920
free market neoliberalism has actually been mostly beneficial and has only been slightly negative for

1070
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:07,120
a relatively small group of people in the West. That's wrong, and it would be even if we assumed,

1071
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:12,640
for the sake of argument, that China, which makes up the vast majority of the growth in those lower

1072
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:17,840
income sections of the graph, has a free market economy. The YouTuber Unlearning Economics has a

1073
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:22,960
great video about this whole narrative of neoliberal progress, where he specifically refutes the abuse

1074
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,240
of the elephant graph, so I'm just going to play that clip to explain it to you more.

1075
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:31,520
The elephant shape comes because the gains at the very bottom of the global distribution

1076
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:36,240
on the left hand of the graph have been low. Moving right along the x-axis, we can see they

1077
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:40,880
are much higher for the global middle class, are low again for the middle class of rich countries,

1078
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:46,640
and are high again for the very rich. This paints a picture of globalization as a largely positive,

1079
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:51,680
albeit flawed, process, compressing the global income distribution by creating a much larger

1080
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:56,560
global middle class, while neglecting the middle classes of the rich world, which have seen high

1081
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:01,760
and possibly rising income inequality within their borders. But the elephant graph hides an

1082
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:08,080
assumption which is pervasive in these debates. These are relative changes, expressed in percentages.

1083
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:12,800
If you look at the raw changes in income, shown on this graph, the income gains are largely

1084
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:17,600
flattened at the bottom of the distribution, and the graph takes the familiar hockey stick shape,

1085
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:21,600
albeit with a slight bump in the middle, due to the impressive growth of China and other

1086
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:26,400
Southeast Asian countries. This is also in Lakhnar and Milanovic's original paper,

1087
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:31,680
though the elephant version has been shared more widely. Although incomes rose by 60% for both the

1088
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:36,720
top 1%, and those in the middle of the global income distribution, this was an absolute increase

1089
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:44,400
of $23,000 for the top 1%, but just $800 for the middle. The rich gained the same in relative terms,

1090
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:49,360
but 30 times as much in absolute terms. The elephant shows the former measurement,

1091
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:53,840
while the hockey stick shows the latter. The implication of this is pretty clear.

1092
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:58,720
Almost all of the growth in the global economy was captured by those at the top of the distribution,

1093
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:03,280
failing to go to those who need it most. Yeah, you heard that right. Both of these

1094
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:08,800
graphs are from the same paper, yet those who pushed this narrative took one of them and ignored

1095
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:14,960
the other. I wonder why? Take a look at the income growth of the bottom 20% here. Their incomes

1096
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:21,760
increased by $217 in 30 years, adjusted for inflation, and purchasing power between different

1097
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:27,520
countries. Now, what about someone in the top 80%, in line with the western middle class?

1098
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:35,920
Their incomes increased by $2,218. 10 times more. Again, this is adjusted for purchasing power parity,

1099
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:40,080
so it's not like that money is worthless due to the higher prices of goods in richer countries.

1100
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:45,760
It is actually just straight up 10 times more. So clearly, it's not the poor Chinese factory

1101
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:51,840
worker whose income has increased by a whopping $217 in 30 years, who's robbed the average

1102
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:56,960
westerner of their share of economic growth. It's the people represented on the far right side of

1103
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:03,440
the graph, whose incomes increased by 28 times that of the global average. The elephant graph

1104
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:09,120
was cherry picked by the World Economic Forum, Harris, and many other propagandists to mask

1105
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:15,120
inconvenient facts for their narratives like these. So, Harris started out by claiming that

1106
01:43:15,120 --> 01:43:20,720
neoliberalism, which he calls shareholder capitalism and free market capitalism, increased

1107
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:26,960
economic growth in the west by using a misleading graph of per capita GDP, which was not adjusted

1108
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:32,400
for inflation. Now, he's implying that neoliberalism was actually disadvantageous for most people in

1109
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:37,760
the west, and that there was a massive redistribution in income from them to the rest of the world,

1110
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:43,840
and the richest 1% and up. This narrative is not only incredibly contradictory, but also untrue.

1111
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:49,840
There was a massive redistribution in income, yes, but only to the top 1%. The empirical data,

1112
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:55,600
no matter what metrics you use, no matter what variables you adjust by, consistently shows this.

1113
01:43:55,600 --> 01:44:01,120
Neoliberalism has accomplished absolutely nothing but the redistribution of income from the majority

1114
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:07,280
of people to the richest people, and it's like that by design. So, next and finally,

1115
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:11,280
Harris shows us a graph of global CO2 emissions for some reason.

1116
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:19,120
The second graph looks like this. This shows the amount of CO2 emissions by country.

1117
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:24,400
You've got Europe and the United States, and then up here you've got China, the world's

1118
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:31,600
largest emitter of CO2. Like the elephant graph, this graph combines loads of data to show us that

1119
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:38,080
shareholder capitalism focuses so much on short-term profits for shareholders that it leaves out any

1120
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:44,800
consideration for how this economic activity affects the planet we live on and our ability to live on it.

1121
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:49,360
He makes sure to point out that China now has the world's largest share of global CO2 emissions,

1122
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:53,440
when you measure them by country at least, neglecting to mention that until, like,

1123
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:58,400
a couple of weeks ago actually, China had the world's largest population, congratulations India,

1124
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:02,000
and it still hasn't approached the per capita emissions of the West,

1125
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,480
and especially not the US, where the average person emits about three times more than the

1126
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:11,120
average Chinese person. And given that Harris also noted in his video that

1127
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:17,920
And more and more foreign companies flocked to China for its cheap labor. It became the world's factory.

1128
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:23,120
Then it would stand to reason that a fair bit of those emissions are also on behalf of the West.

1129
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:26,800
Yet they still count against China and not against them.

1130
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:31,600
His analysis of this graph is very short and just seems kind of tacked on in superfluous,

1131
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:35,040
like he wanted to throw in a token acknowledgement of climate change at the end,

1132
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:39,520
so that he could subsequently imply that stakeholder capitalism would magically fix it,

1133
01:45:39,520 --> 01:45:44,160
while also driving home the general sort of anti-China vibe of this part of the video.

1134
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:49,600
Right after him telling us how awesome it was that China finally came to its senses and copied

1135
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:56,080
the free market capitalism that's work so great for the West, there's this jarring tone shift.

1136
01:45:56,080 --> 01:46:00,560
Now it seems that free market capitalism hasn't actually gone that well for the West.

1137
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:04,080
China's success also came at the expense of the average Westerner,

1138
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:07,520
and China even bears massive blame for climate change.

1139
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:12,160
So which is it? Is China an awesome example of free market capitalism success,

1140
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:16,560
or a massive threat to the livelihood and well-being of the average person in the West?

1141
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:20,240
What's really most jarring about this to me though is that it seems like

1142
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:22,800
people don't really notice when he does this.

1143
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:26,560
At least from reading the comments, you won't really see anyone picking up on these sorts of

1144
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:31,920
contradictions and incoherency. Kind of worrying to me, and I hope that maybe my video will

1145
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:36,000
sort of encourage people to consume YouTube content, not just Johnny Harris videos,

1146
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,880
but all YouTube content with a bit more of a critical eye.

1147
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:44,000
Anyway, so it's especially nonsensical for Harris to bring up climate change in this video,

1148
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,760
because the only actual evidence that he presents throughout the entire video

1149
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:53,200
for the supposed success of free market capitalism was that one graph of raw GDP growth.

1150
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:59,600
For Harris, growth is just sort of good in of itself, and it improves what he calls prosperity,

1151
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:04,240
yet that is precisely the sort of thinking that led to runaway climate change.

1152
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:07,920
The reality is that, as the last 40 to 50 years have shown,

1153
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:12,560
there is not necessarily an automatic correlation between economic growth

1154
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:17,040
and improvements in living standards. Growth just means more national income,

1155
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:22,480
and if most or all of that extra income is being distributed straight to the people on top,

1156
01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:27,200
the benefits for everyone else will be marginal or non-existent, while the costs,

1157
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:32,400
like the impending climate catastrophe, will be shouldered primarily by everyone outside of

1158
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:38,000
that privileged minority. And this is a big reason why capitalism just is never going to

1159
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:42,800
work that well for most people. While, particularly in state-directed forms,

1160
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:48,240
it does grow wealth better than the systems that came before it, it also creates a tiny minority

1161
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:54,480
of people with immense economic and thus political power, which they then use to ensure two things.

1162
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:59,040
One, that efforts at power and income redistribution are stunted as much as possible,

1163
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:02,720
so that as much of this growth as possible goes straight to themselves.

1164
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:08,320
And two, that this growth continues as unabated as possible in order to ensure themselves as much

1165
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:13,520
income as possible, even as this makes the planet increasingly less habitable for humans.

1166
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:18,480
The World Economic Forum is the most important representative body of exactly that class of

1167
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:23,920
people, and Johnny Harris was paid by them to make this video about how awesome economic growth has

1168
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:29,520
supposedly been throughout the last 40 to 50 years or so, you know, with some very minor caveats,

1169
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:33,920
like runaway climate change and immense inequality that they only acknowledged because

1170
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:38,720
they're now completely impossible to deny. But don't worry, they swear they'll fix them for

1171
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:43,760
us out of the goodness of their hearts if we just adopt their vision of a new form of capitalism,

1172
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:47,840
which is not only fundamentally the same as the old form of capitalism, but which would

1173
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:52,160
also just so happen to hand them, the ones who cause these problems in the first place,

1174
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:58,000
copious amounts of additional direct governmental power. Yeah, that sounds like a great idea.

1175
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:02,960
Anyway, so after the CO2 emissions graph part, the conclusion that we dissected at the beginning

1176
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:07,600
of the video begins. So we're pretty much done here. There's really just little about this video

1177
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:13,040
that makes any sense without the context of it just being a particularly poorly made propaganda

1178
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:17,360
piece. It's just a guy presenting a very disjointed historical narrative with massive

1179
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:22,640
unexplained time skips that's very loosely based on reality, where he insists that free market

1180
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:27,520
capitalism is responsible for anything good that's ever happened, while presenting nothing but a few

1181
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:33,520
misleading graphs or just outright lying to sustain that narrative. Then at the end, he pulls out

1182
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:38,240
more misleading graphs, contradicts everything that he just spent seven whole minutes telling you,

1183
01:49:38,240 --> 01:49:43,040
and then insists that the only way forward is to do exactly what the world's worst corporations

1184
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:48,800
tell us to do. It is utterly embarrassing that Johnny Harris frames himself as a journalist

1185
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:54,320
who according to him does copious amounts of research for his videos, including this one,

1186
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:58,720
where he gets pretty much everything wrong, provides next to no evidence for his claims,

1187
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:03,840
and messes up to a comical level when he does actually try to provide a source. And this video

1188
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:09,120
is indicative of the quality of research across his entire channel. It's garbage. But unfortunately,

1189
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:13,760
it seems to work regardless because he gets a whole lot of views. And as the link for this

1190
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:19,760
response video makes clear, it takes infinitely more effort to refute made up bullshit than the

1191
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:25,280
effort that goes into making up the bullshit. In conclusion, Johnny Harris is a liar. Worse.

1192
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:31,200
His lies are about as complex as lying to a child that babies are delivered to your doorstep by stalks.

1193
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:37,200
Way worse. He took money to lie and mislead on behalf of one of the world's most nefarious and

1194
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:43,040
damaging, ultra-rich advocacy organizations, and even seemed proud of doing so when he was called

1195
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:47,040
out on it. If there's anything actually useful that you should take from this video beyond that,

1196
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:52,480
it's one, that neoliberalism actually sucks, and that other forms of capitalism pretty much

1197
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:58,000
suck too, though quite a bit less, and two, that all of the problems that I've outlined here about

1198
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:03,520
Johnny Harris's content are not actually unique to his content. The vast majority of YouTube

1199
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:09,280
infotainment, particularly historical infotainment, is exactly the same. It's just people who make

1200
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:13,520
confident-sounding statements that the audience is just supposed to take for granted because

1201
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:18,800
they said so. It's rare for them to even explain their reasoning, let alone provide anything resembling

1202
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:24,080
adequate evidence for it. The average YouTube history video is so bad that treating it as

1203
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:28,480
anything more than background noise while you clean the house or something is a huge mistake.

1204
01:51:28,480 --> 01:51:32,480
That's all for now. If you liked this video and want to see more like it, then subscribe

1205
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:37,440
and check out my other videos. And if you really like my stuff, consider supporting me on Patreon

1206
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:42,480
or Ko-fi. It all really helps, because unlike some other YouTubers, my videos aren't funded by

1207
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:48,240
billionaire advocacy groups, but rather by voluntary contributions from my viewers. Anyway, bye!

1208
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:31,680
Thank you all for watching. See you next time!
