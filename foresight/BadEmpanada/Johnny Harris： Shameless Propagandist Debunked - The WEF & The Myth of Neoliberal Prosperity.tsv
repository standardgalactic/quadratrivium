0	5120	If you watch political or historical content on YouTube, you're probably aware of Johnny Harris.
5120	9520	He's hard to miss because YouTube's algorithm recommends his videos a lot.
9520	14800	Back in 2021, the YouTuber Tom Nicholas made a video about Harris getting sponsored by the
14800	20160	World Economic Forum to make a video promoting a book they wrote. Tom used that video, called
20160	25520	How China Became So Powerful, as an example of how money can be used to get seemingly independent
25520	30880	YouTubers to make paid propaganda. Harris then responded in the comment section. He admitted
30880	35600	that the video was made in partnership with the WEF, but said that he didn't see a problem with it.
35600	39920	Then in another comment, he bemoaned the fact that no one was taking the actual argument of
39920	45840	his video seriously. According to him, he'd done exhaustive research, sifting through lots of data
45840	50400	to make that video, and people were just using the fact that it was made on behalf of the WEF
50400	54960	as an excuse to avoid engaging with its actual content. Johnny should have been careful what he
54960	59520	wished for because it's come true. In this video, we're going to be refuting the actual content
59520	64560	of the video in question, which is not very good to say the least. If it was actually the result
64560	70320	of him spending loads of time researching, then his research skills should be seriously questioned.
77440	81600	This video was made possible thanks to my supporters on Patreon and Ko-fi.
82400	86720	This video is broadly indicative of Harris' content in general. He likes to act like he's
86720	91840	teaching you something new, profound, and different. Hidden knowledge of the powers that be have kept
91840	96960	on the down low. Things that go against the status quo and the taken for granted opinions that most
96960	102400	people hold. In reality, though, most of his videos are simplistic slump that serve precisely to
102400	107840	direct the audience towards conclusions that uphold the status quo, either through obfuscation,
107840	113680	or, as in the case of this video, by outright supporting it. They're usually just barrages
113680	118080	of rapid fire statements that Harris, and whoever works for him because he's definitely not making
118080	123120	these videos by himself, make little to no effort to actually explain, let alone back up with any
123120	126880	sources. Before you can think about what he's saying and the fact that he's not really giving
126880	130960	you any reason to even believe it, he's already moved on to telling you what to think about something
130960	136800	else, while stock footage plays with inspiring music and camera roll sound effects in the background.
136800	139920	Here's an illustrative example from the video in question.
139920	147360	This was China, the Middle Kingdom, and right next door, India. This was the center of the global
147360	152160	economic universe, but around the 1800s, that started changing.
155680	161040	Over here in Europe and the United States, there was a major revolution that started taking place.
161360	170480	Science, then machines, then weapons, trains, cars, flight, bombs, factories, cities,
170480	176720	and with their new power, these countries started to expand to take over large swaths of the map.
177600	182160	China remained a great civilization, but as the West started showing up,
182160	187760	knocking on China's door with their big guns, China couldn't really match their firepower,
187760	191600	and they had to concede land to Britain, which is how we got Hong Kong.
192240	196160	The Industrial Revolution didn't really happen in China the same way it did in the West,
196800	202400	and by the middle of the 1800s, China began a massive decline in its economic standing in the
202400	207360	world. A century later, that situation got way worse, as China was invaded by its neighbor,
207360	213920	Japan. China's economy was no longer the prosperous Middle Kingdom, but rather a shadow of itself,
213920	220320	a poor country that was being occupied by outsiders. Once World War II was over, the West
220320	226400	devised a new global economic and financial system. It was modeled after the economic system that
226400	231840	was working so well in the West, capitalism, free enterprise. That's really the essence of
231840	237200	Johnny Harris right there, a flurry of no context statements thrown out with little explanation and
237200	241840	backed up by nothing more than stock footage and his word. In the course of about 90 seconds,
241840	245440	he describes China as having been one of the most powerful countries in the world.
245440	251120	Then industrialization just sort of magically happening, which subsequently enabled the West
251120	258480	to get stronger, expand, and attack China. Then there's a 100 year time skip. It's now 1945,
258480	265360	and oh, Japan is invading China now, yes? So China is suddenly relatively weak now,
265360	270880	and oh, there's capitalism too apparently. What a ride that was. Harris has all of this
270880	276240	completely backwards. He presents the industrial revolution like it's what enabled the European
276240	281680	colonialism that he refers to as expansion. Yet said colonialism predated the industrial
281680	287600	revolution, which began in the 18th century by hundreds of years. So it was the colonialism
287600	292800	that enabled the industrial revolution, not the other way around. The historian Eric Williams
292800	298000	showed via exhaustive archival research that the profits that funded much of the first industrial
298000	302560	revolution, and thus led to everything that came afterwards, came from British slave colonies in
302560	308000	the Caribbean. And that's just one small example of how the murder, subjugation, and dispossession
308000	311920	of much of the rest of the world is what the West's economic power and the development of
311920	317040	capitalism was built on. So it was colonialism elsewhere that gave the Western countries the
317040	322560	advantages that they needed to subsequently colonize China and eliminate it as a competitor,
322560	327440	rather than just some magical sudden explosion of technology and science that they then took
327440	333600	advantage of. I love how he actually verbatim just exclaims science. It's like a Tim and Eric
333600	340240	skit. Science. So huge L to China for making the fatal mistake of not killing, robbing,
340240	344880	and enslaving people on the other side of the world to spur their own industrial revolution.
344880	350000	The main narrative throughout this video is that free market capitalism is amazing. So his reasons
350000	354560	for skipping over what actually happened so egregiously can be deduced pretty easily. It's
354560	360000	a lot easier to make a video celebrating capitalist free enterprise if you ignore the much less
360000	364880	savoury reality of how it came to be. And he especially needed to do this because the World
364880	369920	Economic Forum probably wouldn't be very happy about a video that presents the early development
369920	375280	of capitalism and capitalism in general for that matter in anything but a glowing light.
375280	380480	The final bit of that clip and what comes after it is particularly characteristic of the often
380480	387760	chaotic poorly structured zero substance nature of Johnny Harris's videos. The West devised a new
387760	393680	global economic and financial system. It was modeled after the economic system that was working so
393680	399280	well in the West. Capitalism. Free enterprise. Still with some government oversight and high
399280	404320	taxes for the rich and corporations, but it was still capitalism. So there's a 100 a year time
404320	410720	skipped to 1945 and capitalism is only being introduced now. Not with the industrial revolution
410720	415360	of two centuries beforehand, which he covered about a minute earlier. He then tells us that
415360	421200	before this, this capitalism was working so well in the West. But this is contradicted by the very
421200	426720	fact that what he's describing here is the Bretton Woods economic system established by the USA and
426720	430800	other Western countries at the end of World War II. Though you might have missed that because he
430800	436320	just glosses over all the details entirely. He just flashes Bretton Woods on the screen and explains
436320	441600	nothing about it beyond it apparently involving more government oversight and higher taxes on the
441600	447040	rich. The post war Western economic order, which is known as the Bretton Woods system was a pretty
447040	452000	substantial departure from how things were before it and we'll be going into that in more depth later.
452000	457600	The point here though is if things were going so well beforehand as Harris claims,
457600	461360	it was modeled after the economic system that was working so well in the West.
461360	466800	Then why would such substantial reforms have even been carried out? They wouldn't have been,
466800	472400	obviously. This was just six years after the end of the Great Depression, the worst economic crisis
472400	478640	in recorded history, which was immediately followed by World War II, the worst war in recorded history.
478640	484000	So capitalism clearly wasn't actually working well at the time at all and that was precisely
484000	488880	why these reforms were instituted. Harris is honestly often kind of difficult to respond to
488880	493200	because he just makes statements like that which amounts a little more than things were good,
493200	498560	so everyone agreed to do more good things. In reference to the fucking Great Depression,
498560	504240	World War fucking II and the sweeping economic reforms that were carried out afterwards in
504240	509280	an attempt to try and ensure that those things didn't happen again. It's genuinely childish.
509280	515280	He presents history as if it has no context, no continuity, no nothing. To refute him,
515280	519840	I had to go over the basics of what actually happened from scratch because his video just
519840	524640	doesn't actually explain anything at all. And it's not like he's just getting some minor details
524640	529120	wrong either. He's grossly mischaracterizing everything and leaving out so much crucial
529120	535360	information that contradicts him that any response to his claims takes 5,000 times more effort than
535440	540880	he put in to make them in the first place. Like he just blurts out that capitalism was working
540880	548320	so well. That's a pretty bold statement to make about the world in 1945, given everything that
548320	553280	had just happened in the decade or so prior. You'd think he'd at least expand on why he's saying
553280	558640	that with some examples as to why and maybe even, I don't know, provide some proof to back it up,
558640	564080	but Johnny Harris is above such pettiness. He just says stuff and then moves on. The audience
564080	569920	is to just trust him. His videos are just a barrage of statement after statement, 90% of them
569920	575600	backed up by nothing more than his undue confidence, maybe 10% of them actually being followed up with
575600	581040	any attempt to explain the why and how of what he's saying, and even fewer than that backed up by
581040	586160	anything even resembling a source. When he finally does get around to trying to present some evidence,
586160	591440	it usually doesn't even actually back up what he's saying. And it sometimes even presents it as if
591440	596720	it's some sort of special event. It's snappily edited and the music ramps up as if to say,
596720	602400	look guys, I'm citing a source. I did it. You can trust me. He does exactly that in this video
602400	606800	actually. After seven minutes of rapid fire statements with next to nothing presented to
606800	614880	even try to back them up, this happens. I have two graphs I want to show you. They look like this.
615280	622320	Wow. Great graphs he got there, dude. Excellent job. You finally presented a source. It's really
622320	628560	propaganda theater. It's made to look and sound like it's insightful, informative, authoritative,
628560	633440	and thus correct. But it falls apart immediately if you watch it while paying full attention and
633440	638080	think about what's being said and what you're being shown. The video that we're covering here is an
638080	644480	amazing example of all of this. It is the Johnny Harris video, par excellence. I speak good French,
644480	650640	but it's also a paid propaganda video designed to dishonestly present the worst ideas from the
650640	655520	world's most powerful and ghoulish capitalist and their corporations hatch for the purposes of
655520	660480	maintaining their own power and wealth as if they're actually beneficial to the average person.
660480	665200	Despite the title ostensibly being about China, it really has little to nothing to do with it.
665200	671040	China is just used as a framing device to celebrate free markets, neoliberal capitalism,
671040	676640	and then suggest more neoliberal capitalism as the solution to problems caused by neoliberal
676640	681360	capitalism on behalf of the elites who have themselves benefited the most from neoliberal
681360	687120	capitalism. Johnny Harris's videos already tend to be pretty childish propaganda, and in this one,
687120	692080	where he's being paid by the World Economic Forum, he becomes a parody of himself.
692080	696240	Something that Tom Nicholas didn't quite cover in his video is that Johnny Harris
696240	700800	completely misrepresents the ideas that he's being paid to promote here, which are actually
700800	706080	even worse than what they already seem like on the surface. He lied in order to paint a scheme
706080	711920	crafted by billionaires to institute direct corporate rule over international governmental
711920	717760	systems such as the UN as actually just little more than corporations being a bit nicer to their
717760	722560	workers. And I'm well aware of the fact that that sounds like a conspiratorial exaggeration,
722560	727440	but as I'm about to show you, it's really not. We're going to continue on here from the second
727440	732320	half of the video, and then we're going to go back and dissect the rest of the first half afterwards.
732320	736400	This is because it's only at the halfway point that he actually plays his hand
736400	740720	and gets down to the real point of the video, which is to be propaganda for the World Economic
740720	746240	Forum. So dissecting this bit is the most important thing to do here, and it's also very important
746240	750480	context for the first half of the video too, because it's just so blatantly wrong about
750480	754800	everything that it only really starts to make sense once you realize that the reason that it's
754800	760960	like that is because the creator was being paid to lie. Part one, Johnny lies for the World Economic
760960	767440	Forum. The World Economic Forum, which Johnny Harris very dishonestly presents as just a
767440	773120	think tank, and I was able to partner with the World Economic Forum, which is a think tank that
773120	778880	I respect, is the world's most powerful advocacy group for corporations and the ultra rich. On the
778880	784480	one hand, it uses resources from its paid members, including pretty much every single one of the
784480	788880	worst corporations that you can think of, to lobby governments and international organizations,
788880	794240	such as the UN, to adopt policies that benefit them at the expense of everyone else. This is the part
794240	799440	of the World Economic Forum, which is most insidious, and it often goes under the radar. So how convenient
799440	804080	it is that in this video, by coincidence, we're going to be covering it. On the other hand,
804080	808960	it and the events that it organizes, such as its yearly summit at Davos in Switzerland,
808960	814560	act as a public relations exercise for its donors and members, as Tom Nicholas explained very well.
815200	819680	Davos and the World Economic Forum then are essentially where the richest 1%
819680	824480	go to pretend to have a conscience. While I'm sure there's plenty of backgroom
824480	829280	wheeling and dealing which is facilitated by the World Economic Forum, in terms of its public
829280	835840	facing activities, it serves as a means for global corporations and the super rich to repeatedly
835840	842080	pretend to have seen the error of their ways and to be on the cusp of change before they go back to
842080	849440	their boardrooms to carry on with business as usual. So Harris establishes the basis for his
849440	855120	talking points taken directly from decades of World Economic Forum propaganda by making a couple
855120	861840	of core claims. Firstly, he claims that the shift in economic policy in the West in the 70s and 80s
861840	868240	towards neoliberalism made the West more prosperous. He makes this clear by continuously praising
868240	873440	probably the most famous neoliberal ideologue of all time, Milton Friedman, and implying that the
873440	879920	policies that he supported worked really well and that he had a point. Milton Friedman sort of had a point
882000	887760	and it led to huge prosperity in the West as the US economy exploded.
888480	893040	All of this is false and we're going to be refuting it in detail in part two of this video.
893040	898560	Side note, if you're confused by me talking about neoliberalism here, then don't worry because I'm
898560	902800	going to be explaining more about it as we get through the video. And I also have a whole video
902800	907440	that explains it and its history in detail that you can check out. To be honest, you'd almost
907440	912000	certainly learn way more that's actually useful by watching that video over this one, though it's
912000	916320	also going to be considerably less entertaining than watching Johnny Harris get embarrassed.
916320	922000	Pick your poison. The second core claim that Harris bases his conclusions on is the idea that
922000	927920	the most important defining part of the modern economic era, again beginning in the 70s and 80s,
927920	933920	is that corporations are now driven by a desire to make profits for their shareholders. So important
933920	939120	and different this has supposedly been that it even merits being delineated as a completely
939120	946160	different form of capitalism known as shareholder capitalism. The idea at the core of this financial
946160	952560	and economic system was that companies would get investment from people who own shares in that
952560	958080	company, we call this a corporation, and that the sole purpose of this corporation was to make
958080	963840	money for these owners or these shareholders. Now this simply isn't true. The defining thing
963840	969360	about this era was that neoliberalism inspired economic policies began to be implemented in
969360	974800	practice in the 1970s and spread all over the world in a couple of decades. Not that there was some
974800	980000	sort of massive paradigm shift where companies started seeking profit more than they had before.
980000	984400	A shareholder is after all just someone who owns a part of a company, which might vary from a
984400	990400	completely insignificant amount to a controlling stake. Corporations have obviously always been
990400	997120	driven by seeking as much profit for their owners as possible. You can go back 110, 120 years or so
997120	1003040	to the era of standard oil for example, one of the most infamously horrible corporations in history
1003040	1007920	and see that things were much the same. Companies seeking shareholder profit, which according to
1007920	1013680	Harris is the most important defining part of the neoliberal era, is actually so unimportant to
1013680	1019200	it that Friedman, the theorist who he cites approvingly throughout the video, didn't even mention
1019200	1025120	that in his own definition of neoliberalism. He wrote, Neoliberalism would accept the 19th
1025120	1029440	century liberal emphasis on the fundamental importance of the individual, but it would
1029440	1035440	substitute for the 19th century goal of laissez-faire as a means to this end, the goal of the competitive
1035440	1041120	order. It would seek to use competition among producers to protect consumers from exploitation,
1041120	1046000	competition among employers to protect workers and owners of property, and competition among
1046000	1051280	consumers to protect the enterprises themselves. The state would police the system, establish
1051280	1056400	conditions favorable to competition and prevent monopoly, provide a stable monetary framework,
1056400	1061200	and relieve acute misery and distress. The citizens would be protected against the state by the
1061200	1066480	existence of a private free market, and against one another by the preservation of competition.
1066480	1072080	So the actual crux of neoliberalism according to Friedman is that competition is everything,
1072080	1077680	that the best society is a dog-eat-dog capitalist one, where everyone and everything is in a
1077680	1082720	competition with one another at all times, with the spoils going to the winners and the losers
1082720	1087600	getting as little as possible. Friedman says that the government should try to foster such a society
1087600	1092880	and froze in some platitudes about this all supposedly being to protect people and a laughable
1092880	1097840	bit about preventing monopoly. There's nothing about shareholders there, and that's because
1097840	1103280	shareholder capitalism is just a buzzword that the World Economic Forum likes to use to divert
1103280	1108480	attention away from neoliberal economic policies and blame the problems that they have caused on
1108480	1114320	a complete red herring. Harris is just parroting them here, which is, you know, what you'd expect,
1114320	1119760	given that they paid him to make this video. A good basic summary of what neoliberalism is in
1119760	1125920	practice comes from the economic historian David Harvey. Neoliberalism is in the first instance
1125920	1131760	a theory of political economic practices that proposes that human well-being can best be advanced
1131760	1137120	by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework
1137120	1142160	characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade. The role of the
1142160	1147360	state is to create and preserve an institutional framework appropriate to such practices. The
1147360	1153120	state has to guarantee, for example, the quality and integrity of money. It must also set up those
1153120	1159360	military, defense, police, and legal structures and functions required to secure private property
1159360	1164880	rights and to guarantee, by force if need be, the proper functioning of markets. Furthermore,
1164880	1171920	if markets do not exist in areas such as land, water, education, healthcare, social security,
1171920	1177600	or environmental pollution, then they must be created by state action if necessary. But beyond
1177600	1182960	these tasks, the state should not venture. State interventions in markets, once created,
1182960	1188720	must be kept to a bare minimum. There has everywhere been an emphatic turn towards neoliberalism
1188720	1195440	in political economic practices and thinking since the 1970s. Deregulation, privatization,
1195440	1200800	and withdrawal of the state from many areas of social provision have become all too common.
1200800	1206560	Almost all states, from those newly minted after the collapse of the Soviet Union to old-style
1206560	1211200	social democracies in welfare states such as New Zealand and Sweden, have embraced,
1211200	1216480	sometimes voluntarily and in other instances in response to coercive pressures, some version
1216480	1222240	of neoliberal theory, and adjusted at least some policies and practices accordingly. That's all
1222240	1228320	exactly the sort of thinking and exactly the sort of economic policies that the World Economic Forum
1228320	1233280	advocates for and that its corporate members benefit from. So they pretty clearly aren't
1233280	1239120	actually against the fundamentals of the economics of this period. So what they instead do is try
1239120	1244720	and convince people that the economic problems of the last 40 to 50 years haven't actually been
1244720	1250800	caused by these policies or by flaws in capitalism itself, but rather just by corporations making
1250800	1255920	a mistake and seeking too much profit. Which apparently wasn't a problem before this,
1255920	1261360	because if we believe this, then they can sell us the idea that the way to fix this problem isn't
1261360	1266560	actually by governments taking meaningful action to rein these corporations in, or any change at all
1266560	1271840	to the economic system itself, but rather by just leaving it to corporations to change how they
1271840	1276960	govern themselves. Just trusting them to voluntarily stop being driven by profit,
1276960	1282560	become socially responsible in other such buzzwords and fix it all themselves. Surely
1282560	1288160	that being honest here, that'll definitely work. This is how the WEF tends to conduct a lot of its
1288160	1293520	public relations exercises. They acknowledge the issues caused by pro-corporate policies,
1293520	1298240	such as massive inequality and climate change, because it's kind of impossible for them to ignore
1298240	1303600	them at this point. But they frame these problems as being caused by things other than their actual
1303600	1308880	causes, because if we accept their alternate explanation, they can then lead us to the conclusion
1308880	1314080	that the overall direction of economic policy should remain fundamentally the same as it has
1314080	1319840	since the 70s and 80s, which is, you know, exactly what they want. It's simple diversion.
1319840	1324640	So, once Harris has finally stopped lying to the viewer about the cause of those problems in the
1324640	1331280	exact same way the World Economic Forum does, he, shocker, proposes the exact solution they do.
1331280	1336640	But of course, he first takes a second to just offhandedly scoff at the idea that socialism
1336640	1342160	might be an alternative solution. In true Johnny Harris fashion, no reasoning or explanation for
1342160	1350080	this is given. So, what's the solution? Is it socialism? No, it's not. It is simply a new
1350080	1355520	version of capitalism, a reframing of how we think about business and globalization.
1355520	1361440	No, he says with utmost confidence. The real solution is to move on to another form of capitalism
1361440	1367600	from this non-existent shareholder one. What we need to do is just change the way we think about
1367600	1372640	business and globalization. He's not actually calling for any action in that buzzword salad,
1372640	1377440	just a change in thinking, which is reflected in the solution that he's about to propose,
1377440	1382320	doing the same stuff, but reframing it as somehow actually beneficial for workers.
1382320	1387840	The mythology of neoliberalism supposedly being good for normal people can no longer be upheld
1387920	1392560	since the last 50 years of its practice have shown us clearly that that's not true. So,
1392560	1398240	it needs a rebranding. And here it is. The solution isn't to scrap capitalism altogether,
1398240	1404080	but instead to expand it, to not just focus on shareholders and delivering them short-term
1404080	1409120	profits as quickly and as efficiently as possible, but to also focus on other people
1409120	1415760	who are affected by the business. You can call these stakeholders. This is like the customers
1415760	1421520	and the suppliers and the employees and the government and the overall economy and the planet
1421520	1426400	and, of course, shareholders. This is called stakeholder capitalism. And it's basically
1426400	1431440	just an acknowledgement that businesses that focus only on profits for shareholders don't
1431440	1436960	end up benefiting everyone. There are winners and losers. So, the solution to the problems
1436960	1444320	of corporations being motivated by self-interest is for corporations to magically just no longer
1444320	1450240	be motivated by self-interest and to start just miraculously renouncing the profit motive,
1450240	1454800	getting themselves a conscience, and voluntarily helping everyone out of the goodness of their
1454800	1458880	hearts, which they don't have because they're corporations. There's not any sort of actual
1458880	1464560	call to action to make this happen. No government intervention, no regulations, no nothing. It's
1464560	1470080	just something that we need to trust corporations to do themselves. Yeah. Obviously, this isn't
1470080	1474640	going to happen. Corporations are not just going to regulate themselves out of a sense of social
1474640	1478800	obligation. They're not just going to give up their wealth and power because they feel bad about
1478800	1484480	having it. On the occasions that they do actually concede things to other so-called stakeholders,
1484480	1491040	it is overwhelmingly because they're forced to do so by government action. And on the very rare
1491040	1496160	occasions where it might seem like they're taking such actions themselves, it's certainly not out
1496160	1501280	of a sense of obligation to other stakeholders. It's just because they've calculated that doing
1501280	1507360	so won't damage or will increase their profits in other ways. For example, by giving them good
1507360	1513280	publicity, by increasing worker productivity, or by keeping workers just happy enough that they're
1513280	1518560	less likely to start advocating for something that might end up costing the company more. A good
1518560	1524000	example of this is Amazon instituting a minimum wage of $15 an hour for American employees.
1524000	1528320	It helps to make them look like they care about their workers, while at the same time,
1528320	1533360	they do everything possible to bust their workers' efforts at unionization to prevent them from
1533360	1538320	actually being able to exert collective pressure on the company and advocate for their own interests
1538320	1543760	on their own terms. It's not about the company legitimately caring about its stakeholders or
1543760	1548640	anything even remotely like that. It's about unaccountable executives deciding to give them
1548640	1553200	a little bit in the hopes that they don't start demanding something more substantial that would
1553200	1558960	lower their profits more. And Amazon, completely coincidentally I'm sure, just so happens to be
1558960	1564800	one of the World Economic Forum's strategic partners. Tom Nicholas summed up the essence of all of this
1564800	1570160	very well. The World Economic Forum's decision to work with Johnny Harris to create a video about
1570160	1576400	how companies such as Apple and Walmart are currently enthusiastically moving away from
1576400	1582480	shareholder capitalism and towards this vague notion of stakeholder capitalism is just another
1582480	1589440	in a long line of examples of the forum attempting to convince us that against all the evidence
1589440	1595040	they are even remotely concerned about anything other than profit. With everything that we've
1595040	1600640	just been over in mind, I want to present you with a quote from this book, Stakeholder Capitalism,
1600640	1605840	which is the book that the World Economic Forum paid Johnny Harris to make this video to promote.
1605840	1611360	The head of the World Economic Forum just launched a book called literally Stakeholder Capitalism.
1611360	1616560	It's an in-depth look at not only the rise of Asia and China, but also other major trends that
1616560	1621040	help us understand the need to upgrade our capitalism. Klaus Schwab, the founder of the
1621040	1627600	World Economic Forum, writes within it, I therefore advocate for a third system which can be defined
1627600	1632320	as stakeholder capitalism. It is capitalism in the traditional definition of the word.
1632320	1637920	Individuals and private companies make up the largest share of the economy. This is, I believe,
1638000	1643200	a requirement for a sustainable economic system. Private individuals and companies must be able
1643200	1648800	to innovate and compete freely, as it unleashes the creative energy and work ethic of most people
1648800	1654480	in society. The economic activities of such private actors must also be protected and guided,
1654480	1659120	to ensure the overall direction of economic development is beneficial to society,
1659120	1664560	and no actor can free ride on the efforts of others. This is the kind of capitalism we ought to
1664560	1668960	endorse. Do you notice how that sounds oddly similar to Milton Friedman's description of
1668960	1673920	neoliberalism that we went over earlier? That's because it is just the same thing. The whole
1673920	1679680	notion of stakeholder capitalism, as presented in this video by Johnny Harris, and as obsessed about
1679680	1686160	by the World Economic Forum, is just a rebranding of neoliberalism. Harris and the WEF erased the
1686160	1692000	existence of neoliberalism entirely, creating this phantom of shareholder capitalism to shoulder
1692000	1696720	the blame for its problems and act as a sort of non-existent scapegoat, in order to propose a
1696720	1702080	solution that they frame as literally an entirely different version of capitalism, which even the
1702080	1708880	slightest scrutiny reveals is still just neoliberalism, with some vague, PR speak buzzwords thrown in
1708880	1714480	to try and make it sound like it's somehow different. It's not. As political scientist Kyle
1714480	1720720	Bailey wrote, now that the myth of free markets can no longer convincingly naturalize the public
1720800	1726880	role of states, in imposing actually existing neoliberalism, the discourse of stakeholder
1726880	1733440	capitalism represents its continuation by other means. Despite pretensions to move beyond profit
1733440	1739600	maximization, corporations' attempts to satisfy extra economic interests remain firmly grounded
1739600	1745040	in the same capitalist market imperatives that proponents of stakeholder capitalism now claim
1745120	1750800	to be addressing. Here's an even worse thing though. Harris isn't even actually being honest
1750800	1755840	about what's stakeholder capitalism, as promoted by the World Economic Forum in the book that he's
1755840	1760880	trying to sell to his viewers here, actually is. His presentation are that he's already incredibly
1760880	1767360	misleading, dishonest, and really just full of lies, but he also left out the more unsavory and
1767360	1772560	much more serious parts about what this term means to the World Economic Forum. You see,
1772560	1778320	they don't just think that companies should take their stakeholders into account or whatever.
1778320	1785760	For them, this notion of stakeholderism extends to everything, including national and international
1785760	1793440	governance. They consider multinational corporations to be stakeholders of the world itself, who
1793440	1799200	should have much bigger and much more direct seats at the table when it comes to political
1799200	1804640	decision making. The BS about corporations saving the world out of the goodness of their hearts
1804640	1810000	by deciding to treat workers slightly better rather than seeking profits is cover for their
1810000	1816480	ultimate idea of giving corporations even more political power than what they already have.
1816480	1822320	This is articulated in the book itself. A company that has a multinational scope of activities
1822320	1828880	not only serves all those stakeholders who are directly engaged, but acts itself as a stakeholder
1828960	1835680	together with governments and civil society of our global future. So, according to the very book
1835680	1841200	that Harris was paid to promote, multinational corporations need to be stakeholders on the
1841200	1847120	national and international stage, on the same level as national governments and civil society
1847120	1853440	organizations, the latter meaning things like NGOs, which are themselves overwhelmingly founded
1853440	1859600	and or funded by those same multinational corporations and so advocate for their interests
1859600	1865200	as well anyway. This is what the stakeholder capitalism buzzword is actually about for them,
1865200	1871200	giving corporations even more direct decision making power regarding the direction of global
1871200	1876880	politics on top of all of the incredibly pervasive and destructive ways in which they already
1876880	1883120	influence global politics. They hide this goal of wanting to make themselves even more powerful
1883200	1888960	stakeholders in international governance behind this notion that all they want to do is make you
1888960	1895760	a stakeholder of the company that you work for. The economist Jens Martens summarized the WEF's
1895760	1902240	overall agenda. The World Economic Forum postulates that a globalized world is best managed by a
1902240	1908560	coalition of multinational corporations, governments, including through the UN system, and select civil
1909120	1914320	society organizations. It argues that governments no longer are the overwhelmingly dominant actors
1914320	1920000	on the world stage and that the time has come for a new stakeholder paradigm of international
1920000	1926000	governance. The World Economic Forum vision includes a public private UN in which certain
1926000	1932000	specialized agencies would operate under joint state and non-state governance systems such as with
1932000	1937440	the Food and Agriculture Organization through a global food agriculture and nutrition redesign
1937440	1943040	initiative. This model also assumes that some issues would be taken off the agenda of the UN
1943040	1949280	system to be addressed by pluralateral, often multi-stakeholder, coalitions of the willing and
1949280	1955760	able. What the World Economic Forum is advocating for with this red herring of stakeholder capitalism
1955760	1960000	is not the solution to the problems of neoliberalism that Harris presents it as,
1960000	1966560	nor is it meant to be. It is rather the final form of neoliberalism, the fundamental neoliberal
1966560	1972960	notion of total and complete competition is taken to the ultimate extreme, corporations competing
1972960	1977840	with governments for the power to govern in a much more direct way than they have before.
1977840	1983760	And it's even worse with a bit more added context. Klaus Schwab, founder and chairman of the WEF,
1983760	1988000	whose name is on the cover of the book, though you know it was almost certainly ghost written,
1988000	1993440	has said that he considers nation states to be obsolete and that they should be replaced with
1993440	1998560	a global issue alliance, which based on their other statements would probably be made up of
1998560	2004560	multinational corporations. In context with everything else, it really makes it seem like their
2004560	2010480	ultimate goal is not just the already incredibly worrying idea of taking substantial decision
2010480	2015840	making power away from states and handing it directly to multinational corporations,
2015840	2022000	but rather to get rid of governments entirely and create some sort of anarcho-capitalist cyberpunk
2022000	2027440	dystopia, where corporations just plain control everything. Now I don't want to fear Monger too
2027440	2032800	much about the WEF's agenda here, while they have laid it all out pretty clearly and pretty
2032800	2037120	explicitly, that doesn't mean that they've gotten their way or that they will. There is no
2037120	2042240	world economic forum led, new world order government on the way or anything, which conspiracy
2042240	2046800	theorists often claim. Though given the kind of stuff that the world economic forum advocates
2046800	2052640	for that we just went over, I can really understand how such conspiracy theories come to be.
2052640	2057200	The WEF is just an advocacy group for corporations that ask the question of,
2057200	2062240	how can corporations get even more power? And they came to the quite rational conclusion from
2062240	2067680	their perspective of, they should try to seize more direct decision making power from governments
2067680	2072320	themselves. This is completely predictable and expected, which is precisely why corporate
2072320	2078000	governed dystopias were already being presented in fiction, long before the WEF proposed such
2078000	2083600	ideas themselves. It's simply the logic of capitalism being taken to its ultimate conclusion.
2083600	2089840	But these goals also aren't zero sum. It's not either they establish the literal anarcho-capitalist
2089840	2095760	cyberpunk dystopia or their failed. They just want as much direct influence over decision making as
2095760	2100400	they can get, and they've actually already been making inroads on this for quite a while now.
2100400	2105840	In the UN for example, the influence of their rhetoric can clearly be seen. Buzzwords for
2105840	2112080	pervasive corporate involvement, like multi-stakeholderism and public-private partnerships,
2112080	2117760	have become more and more common in UN documents. And multinationals have an even more prominent
2117760	2122880	and direct role in the UN and other global initiatives than they've ever had before.
2122880	2129040	In 2019, the World Economic Forum even signed a strategic partnership agreement with the UN.
2129040	2134720	This is extremely bad, not just because more corporate power and influence is bad in general,
2134720	2140160	but also because it's even more undemocratic than things already were before. While average people
2140160	2144800	may be able to exert at least a tiny little bit of influence over their governments through things
2144800	2150320	like voting and protests for example, they have nothing even resembling that minor little bit of
2150320	2155440	influence when it comes to corporations. So with every little bit of decision making ability that
2155440	2161680	corporations wrestle away from states, nationally or internationally, you and people like you lose
2161680	2166880	more of whatever little decision making power you've got left. It's being appropriated from you
2166880	2172320	and being handed over to capitalists and executives directly. In order to even think about fighting
2172320	2176640	these sorts of initiatives, we first need to actually know that they're going on. And now you
2176640	2182560	do, despite the fact that Johnny Harris kind of forgot to inform you of that in his video. Harris
2182560	2187040	outright stated that he read the book and thought that it was great. The book is really good. Yet
2187040	2192160	he nonetheless decided to leave out the whole, corporations should be stakeholders in global
2192160	2198080	governance and get their own seats at the UN thing. He's even proudly gloated that he was personally
2198080	2205760	involved in that year's WEF summit at Davos. The Davos summit happened this week and I'm really
2205760	2210960	glad that I was able to be a part of it. So he's clearly familiar with the organization and he
2210960	2215520	should be familiar with their broader agendas too. They're outlined in the book that he supposedly
2215520	2221120	read. The book that he promotes in this video. His video is already garbage immoral propaganda,
2221120	2228240	but with this extra context, it is even worse. He lied knowingly in exchange for money. It's
2228240	2233680	that simple. And we haven't even covered the rest of the video yet where he lies a whole lot more.
2234320	2236240	Part 2. The Debunking
2238080	2242240	Now with the most important part out of the way, it's time to go back to the first half of the
2242240	2248080	video and refute the historical narrative of neoliberalism bringing amazing prosperity and
2248080	2253360	the claims that Harris makes to craft it, which is the foundation that he uses to propose the
2253360	2259200	ideas that we just dissected. How the video has a title about China, I just don't know. It's
2259200	2264560	mentioned in the intro, promptly forgotten about for a while, and then glossed over for a minute or
2264560	2270320	two later. It's actually a video about how great free market capitalism supposedly is, and China
2270320	2276000	is just used as a framing device for that to pull the viewer in to what is actually a paid propaganda
2276000	2280560	video. This part is going to be quite long and detailed, partly because the effort that you have
2280560	2285600	to put in to debunk misinformation is incredibly high relative to the effort that it takes to make
2285600	2291840	it up, and partly because that's just how my videos are. I like to be thorough. So let's recap
2291840	2297200	and expand upon what we went over at the beginning. The video starts off with this zero context
2297200	2302800	presentation of the industrial revolution as some sort of miracle that just magically popped up out
2302800	2309360	of nowhere. Inverting reality to make it sound like it was the industrial revolution that birthed
2309360	2314720	western colonialism rather than the other way around. And capitalism doesn't sound quite as
2314720	2321200	good if you actually include the fact that what Harris frames as the West's amazing success was
2321200	2326240	built on the subjugation of billions of people. It's important to emphasize that the development
2326240	2332000	of the industrial revolution was hardly some sort of miracle of free market capitalism, as is often
2332000	2337920	taken for granted, including by Harris here. It happened under the circumstances of pervasive
2337920	2343440	government protection of local industry, combined with the aggressive destruction of competitors
2343440	2349600	abroad, and the importation of resources and capital to be invested from the Americas. The best
2349600	2354960	example of this is the development of the British textiles industry, the first truly fully mechanized
2354960	2360080	industry in the world, and the most emblematic development of the first industrial revolution.
2360080	2365600	This industry was not only supplied by slave farmed cotton from the Americas, but was also
2365600	2370800	fostered by the government, who put restrictive tariffs on textile imports from India, which at
2370800	2376160	the time had the most important textile export sector in the world. This encouraged investment
2376160	2382160	in the local textile industry to replace these imports. This is commonly known as import substitution
2382160	2387520	industrialization. All of this happened while the British were also simultaneously colonizing
2387520	2393040	India and directly destroying the Indian textile industry. The result was that the British textile
2393040	2398480	industry became the world's most important, even exporting its products to India itself.
2398480	2404320	So the industrial revolution was built off the back of colonialism and spurred by very
2404320	2408960	anti-free market government interference, contrary to pretty much everything about
2408960	2414000	Harris's narrative throughout this video. Most developed countries today in fact industrialize
2414000	2419440	with these sorts of policies, protectionism, import substitution, etc, and they only started
2419440	2425120	with this rhetoric of free international trade once their own industry was developed enough as
2425120	2432000	a result to out-compete that of other countries. So anyway, moving on. As we went over earlier,
2432000	2439440	Harris then finally introduces capitalism in 1945, about 200 or 300 years depending on who you ask,
2439440	2444080	after the time that it actually developed, conveniently skipping over all of the absolutely
2444080	2449200	horrible things about it during that period. He then moves on to inverting reality again,
2449200	2455360	claiming that capitalism was working so well while simultaneously introducing the post-World
2455360	2461200	War II Bretton Woods Accords. Bretton Woods was an agreement between mostly western states that
2461200	2466880	govern the rules of international trade between them for about 30 years afterwards. This was
2466880	2471920	specifically implemented because capitalism actually wasn't working very well and had just
2471920	2476800	been through its worst ever crisis, the Great Depression, and you know the whole World War II
2476800	2482480	thing too. The Bretton Woods era was characterized by fixed currency exchange rates for international
2482480	2486800	trade which were backed by the gold standard, tightened government regulations on business,
2486800	2492320	strong welfare states, and so-called mixed economies involving both private and public
2492320	2498080	sector ownership. Academically, this is often known as the period of embedded liberalism.
2498080	2503040	The embedded part comes from the work of the economic theorist Carl Polanyi who used the
2503040	2509760	word to emphasize the controls put on markets by outside factors such as the government as opposed
2509760	2515360	to disembedded, which describes a more free market that is not subject to such controls.
2515360	2520320	David Harvey summarized the causes and characteristics of the period of embedded
2520320	2526080	liberalism in the West. The restructuring of state forms and of international relations
2526080	2531120	after the Second World War was designed to prevent a return to the catastrophic conditions
2531120	2536080	that had so threatened the capitalist order in the great slump of the 1930s. It was also
2536080	2540960	supposed to prevent the reemergence of interstate geopolitical rivalries that had led to the war.
2540960	2546240	To ensure domestic peace and tranquility, some sort of class compromise between capital and
2546240	2551520	labor had to be constructed. The thinking at the time is perhaps best represented by an influential
2551520	2557760	text by two eminent social scientists, Robert Dahl and Charles Limblum, published in 1953.
2557760	2563360	Both capitalism and communism in their raw forms had failed, they argued. The only way ahead was to
2563360	2569760	construct the right blend of state, market, and democratic institutions to guarantee peace, inclusion,
2569760	2575040	well-being, and stability. And so a variety of social democratic, Christian democratic,
2575040	2580560	and dyrihista states emerged in Europe after the Second World War. The US itself turned
2580560	2586000	towards a liberal democratic state form, and Japan, under the close supervision of the US,
2586000	2590240	built a nominally democratic but impracticed highly bureaucratic state apparatus,
2590240	2594960	empowered to oversee the reconstruction of that country. What all of these various state forms
2594960	2600800	had in common was an acceptance that the state should focus on full employment, economic growth,
2600800	2606320	and the welfare of its citizens, and that state power should be freely deployed alongside, or if
2606320	2612080	necessary, intervening in or even substituting for market processes to achieve these ends.
2612080	2617840	Fiscal and monetary policies, usually dubbed Keynesian, were widely deployed to dampen business
2617840	2623840	cycles and to ensure reasonably full employment. A class compromise between capital and labor
2623840	2629760	was generally advocated as a key guarantor of domestic peace and tranquility. States actively
2629760	2635200	intervened in industrial policy and moved to set standards for the social wage by constructing
2635200	2640720	a variety of welfare systems, healthcare, education, and the like. This form of political
2641280	2646640	organization is now usually referred to as embedded liberalism, to signal how market
2646640	2651680	processes and entrepreneurial and corporate activities were surrounded by a web of social
2651680	2656720	and political constraints and a regulatory environment that sometimes restrained but in
2656720	2662240	other instances led the way in economic and industrial strategy. State-led planning and in
2662240	2668880	some instances, state ownership of key sectors, coal, steel, automobiles, were not uncommon. For
2668880	2674400	example, in Britain, France, and Italy. The neoliberal project is to disembed capital
2674400	2680720	from these constraints. So yeah, not exactly the sort of thing that Harris is advocating for in
2680720	2685520	this video. Harris glosses over the amount of government intervention that actually characterized
2685520	2691280	this era, acknowledging only that it involved government oversight and higher taxes and regulation,
2691280	2696800	but nonetheless framing it as largely the same as before. A continuation of something that was
2696800	2703200	working so well, which is a very audacious thing to say about the period immediately following
2703200	2709520	the Great Depression and World War II. He then credits a vague notion of capitalism with rebuilding
2709520	2714320	Europe after the war, as if it was just the wonders of the free market that did it or something.
2714320	2719760	Seriously, he talks about this in the same way that a missionary would tell you about the miracles
2719760	2725680	of Jesus Christ. Capitalism, free enterprise, still with some government oversight and high
2725760	2730240	taxes for the rich and corporations, but it was still capitalism. And after the war,
2730240	2736800	this capitalism would go on to become a miracle for many countries. Rebuilding Germany, France,
2736800	2743440	Japan. For many in the West, post-World War II capitalism was like a magic elixir that was fixing
2743440	2750720	everything. He verbatim calls it a magic elixir that was fixing everything. At least try to be
2750720	2757440	subtle, come on. His core claim in that segment is that capitalism caused a miracle that rebuilt
2757440	2762960	Europe after World War II, implying that what happened was some sort of miracle of the free market.
2762960	2767520	That couldn't be further from the truth. What happened after the war is that much of Europe
2767520	2774800	was destroyed while the USA, due to its geographic position, came out not just unscathed, but with
2774800	2781120	a booming economy. So Western European countries, along with others such as Japan and South Korea,
2781120	2786880	were absolutely desperate to rebuild. And the USA was the only game in town, since they obviously
2786880	2792800	wouldn't have let them seek help from the USSR, even if they wanted to. The US used this monopoly to
2792800	2798240	create the Marshall Plan and other adjacent initiatives, which gave aid to those countries.
2798240	2804080	The catch was that this money could only be used to buy resources, such as food and building
2804080	2810720	materials, from sources that the USA had chosen, which usually meant from the USA itself. This not
2810720	2816160	only meant that the money from the aid was just flowing right back to the USA anyway, but it also
2816160	2822560	allowed its exports to penetrate into Europe in a much more long-lasting fashion. All of this was
2822560	2829440	imposed by the USA on countries that were in no position to refuse. So it was an initiative conceived
2829440	2835280	by the US government, directed by them every step of the way, to give their country a functional
2835280	2841680	monopoly over post-war trade and ensure their influence over the aid recipients. That is how
2841680	2847840	these countries were actually rebuilt after World War II, not by the wonders of free market forces,
2847840	2854720	but by pervasive and often coercive state action. But Johnny Harris frames it as some sort of magical
2854720	2861360	free market explosion, where the magic words of capitalism and free market just caused miracles
2861360	2866480	to happen. But again, the reason that Harris can't be honest about this and just glosses over it so
2866480	2872240	childishly is because the thesis of this part of the video is just that free market capitalism is
2872240	2878000	super awesome, because that's what the World Economic Forum mandated conclusion needs it to be.
2878000	2883440	So if you acknowledge the fact that the post-World War II rebuilding of Europe was carried out under
2883440	2888880	just about the fervorce thing from the principles of free market capitalism imaginable, his entire
2888880	2894560	narrative would crumble. Harris then makes this statement. It was working so well that more and
2894560	2899360	more people started to believe that we needed to get government out of capitalism and let the market
2899360	2904720	just do its thing. This is another claim that's just contradicted by his own narrative. Everything
2904720	2910800	was just working so well after the war with embedded liberalism that this drove people to
2910800	2916960	want to change things by completely abandoning everything that had characterized that system
2916960	2923360	and all of its magical miracles, where only two minutes in and Harris has said something stupid,
2923360	2929200	nonsensical or contradicted himself just about every other sentence. Anyway, so this just isn't
2929200	2935920	true. Normal people, one suddenly like, ah man, this sucks. I hate being guaranteed a decent wage.
2935920	2941040	I hate having public health care and social welfare. I hate that corporations can't just do
2941040	2945360	whatever they want and that I actually have some bargaining power so they have to at least give
2945360	2951600	people like me some concessions. You know what I want? I want all of that gone. Now, the people
2951600	2957840	that were advocating for this were businessmen, executives, and their paid propagandists,
2957840	2964880	Johnny Harris's forebears, like Milton Friedman, the one singular person who he actually presents
2964880	2971760	as evidence for his idea of people wanting to just let the market do its thing. One of the major
2971760	2978160	advocates for this idea of unfettered capitalism was this guy. There has never in history been a
2978160	2982640	more effective machine for eliminating poverty than the free enterprise system in the free market.
2982640	2989600	A Chicago-based economist named Milton Friedman. If they fail, they bear the cost. If they succeed,
2990400	2994880	they get the benefit. This turn towards letting the market do its thing,
2994880	3001520	as Harris describes it, began in the early 1970s. It's called, as we went over earlier,
3001520	3008400	neoliberalism, not shareholder capitalism. And its conception actually long predates the time frame
3008400	3013760	that Harris seems to ascribe to it. It's public advocates who had been paid to push it from the
3013760	3020160	mid-1940s onwards by the ultra-rich via think tanks such as the Mont Pelerin Society and the
3020160	3026560	Institute of Economic Affairs had long been lobbying for a turn to neoliberalism. This advocacy was,
3026560	3031440	from the very beginning, in opposition to embedded liberalism and bread and woods,
3031440	3036400	because capitalists considered this system to be too restrictive on their interests. Not,
3036400	3042800	as Harris claims, the post-war period being super awesome, causing people in general to,
3042800	3049120	for some reason, just incomprehensibly decide to get rid of everything that had characterized it
3049120	3055120	and replace it with something else. The actual reasons behind this turn to neoliberalism are a
3055120	3061360	lot less savory than that. Embedded liberalism began to run into problems in the early 1970s,
3061360	3067840	and the 1973 oil crisis was the definitive nail in its coffin. Numerous prominent scholars on the
3067920	3074160	subject like David Harvey, Gerard Domeniel and Dominique Levy have concluded that the upper classes
3074160	3079440	took advantage of this chaotic situation to push for the replacement of embedded liberalism with
3079440	3085440	neoliberalism. Up until this point, neoliberalism had been little more than a fringe economic
3085440	3091520	theory pushed by their think tanks and a couple of board and paid for university economics departments
3091520	3096800	like Friedman's University of Chicago. But now they had a chance to make it reality,
3096800	3102320	to rapidly put it into practice. The post-war system had greatly reduced their economic power
3102320	3107920	from its pre-war levels, and they wanted it back. Neoliberalism in practice was first
3107920	3113760	implemented via imperialism. The USA backed a bloody military coup in Chile, where an elected
3113760	3119040	socialist government was overthrown via military coup and replaced with a neoliberal military
3119040	3125280	dictatorship. Economists trained at the aforementioned corporate funded Chicago School of Economics
3125280	3130480	by the same Milton Friedman who Johnny Harris uncritically presents as some sort of genius,
3130480	3135280	were shipped in from the US to dictate the direction of social and economic policy.
3135280	3139920	They took on massive foreign debt via loans from the International Monetary Fund,
3139920	3145440	opened up natural resources to unregulated corporate exploitation, privatized swaths of
3145440	3151200	public assets, abolished or privatized public services and social welfare, and opened up the
3151200	3157360	economy to the free market exploitation of foreign companies. Chile, along with other violently
3157360	3164160	imposed US-backed neoliberal experiments of the early to mid-70s, was used as something of a lab
3164160	3168480	to see whether neoliberalism would really work in practice in the way that the rich
3168480	3173040	had hoped it would. Economic inequality skyrocketed practically immediately.
3173040	3178000	Wealth was redistributed very effectively from Chile's working class to the richest segments
3178960	3184480	as well as to the rich of other countries. So the experiment proved a resounding success at its
3184480	3190880	aim of redistributing wealth and power back to the rich, which inspired implementations of the same
3190880	3197520	in the West itself. Margaret Thatcher subsequently took power in 1979 in the UK on a neoliberal
3197520	3204080	platform, while Ronald Reagan became president of the US in 1981. Reagan's economic policy was
3204080	3210560	written for him directly by the Heritage Foundation, a corporate funded think tank founded by
3210560	3215360	conservative businessmen to promote neoliberalism in the wake of the collapse of the bread and
3215360	3220320	wood system. Like literally, they founded it a year or two later. They clearly saw the blood in
3220320	3225600	the water and were ready to pounce. The results from Chile were then reproduced in those countries.
3225600	3232560	The share of national income of the top 0.1% of the population in the US and the UK had been falling
3232640	3238640	throughout the entire post-war period and reached its lowest level in history around 1978,
3238640	3244240	right before the Thatcher and Reagan era began. In the following two decades as neoliberal policies
3244240	3252800	were implemented, the trend shifted. Their income share in the UK rose from 1% to 3.5% by 1998 and
3252800	3259440	2% to 6% in the US. In the latter case, this rivaled the levels of wealth and power held by the
3259440	3265520	ultra-rich during parts of the Great Depression. This was concurrent with a massive fall in real
3265520	3271360	wages, meaning average worker wages adjusted for inflation for the purposes of being able
3271360	3277360	to compare wages at different times. Real wages in the US had grown substantially all throughout
3277360	3282880	the bread and woods period, then fell slightly due to the oil crisis in the mid-1970s before
3282880	3288960	stabilizing and rising again. They then completely dropped off a cliff once Reagan introduced neoliberalism
3288960	3296800	in the 1980s and by the year 2000 had only just managed to recover to 1966 levels. Even today,
3296800	3302400	real wages in the US are stagnant and are still only around the same level they were in the late
3302400	3308320	60s. This all happened while GDP growth and increases in productivity levels remain the
3308320	3314240	same as before. Throughout the bread and woods period, wages increased as the economy grew,
3314240	3320480	while in the neoliberal period, wages started decreasing, becoming decoupled from economic
3320480	3326320	growth. This means that what neoliberalism actually achieved wasn't the prosperity that Harris
3326320	3332320	nauseatingly repeats it did throughout the video, but rather it ensured little more than that huge
3332320	3337920	shares of income that previously were going to workers would go to the rich instead. I'm getting
3337920	3343280	ahead of myself a bit here because what I just said actually also contradicts large parts of
3343280	3348160	Harris's narrative that we haven't even gotten around to yet, including the very next sentence
3348160	3354080	that he utters. Now, let's contrast the reality of the neoliberal turn that I just went over with
3354080	3359280	Harris's own explanation for it. More and more people started to believe that we needed to get
3359280	3364960	government out of capitalism and let the market just do its thing. Now yes, I know that's just a
3364960	3369840	short summary and that's not the problem here. The problem is that it's just completely wrong
3369920	3375200	and that even for a short summary, it simplified down to a kindergarten propaganda level.
3375200	3379760	Capitalism was awesome and magic, so people decided that they wanted the government out of
3379760	3385440	capitalism and that's how we got neoliberalism. I genuinely am kind of worried that there seems
3385440	3391200	to be many grown adults out there who this sort of thing works on. Harris then does the whole
3391200	3396880	world economic forum thing of obscuring neoliberalism by claiming that it's actually shareholder
3396880	3400960	capitalism, you know, the stuff that we just went over. Since we've already gone over that,
3400960	3406560	I'm going to skip ahead about 30 seconds to where he argues that Milton Friedman was right
3406560	3412720	because neoliberalism, according to him, actually did work really well. And his proof for this is
3412720	3418880	a graph of raw GDP per capita in the USA. And if you look at the data in the United States and the
3418880	3425360	West, Milton Friedman sort of had a point. Now, first off, I already kind of refuted the argument
3425360	3431280	that he's making here by showing that after neoliberal reforms in the US, GDP and productivity
3431280	3437840	continued to rise at the same rates as before, but real wages dropped. But even if GDP per capita
3437840	3443120	had actually been growing at a higher rate than before during the neoliberal period, as he claims,
3443120	3449680	the massive drop in real wages would indicate that this increased growth was just going straight
3449680	3454720	into the pockets of the ultra rich, while normal people were just getting poorer and poorer every
3454720	3461120	year. This is demonstrative of how GDP and GDP per capita are usually not at all useful measures
3461120	3466880	of anything actually indicative of living standards on their own. But even if we do ignore all of the
3466880	3472960	more relevant metrics aside from GDP per capita that show that neoliberalism hasn't actually been
3472960	3480080	good at all for anyone but the rich, even by Harris's own measure, he's wrong. Since 1870,
3480080	3486320	real GDP per capita in the USA has grown at a steady rate overall, so much so that its trend
3486320	3491120	can be charted by a straight line. The growth rate had already recovered to the average rate
3491120	3497680	throughout US history of around 2% per year. So neoliberalism didn't actually even make the US
3497680	3503600	economy grow any faster. The growth of the neoliberal period is rather exactly on trend,
3503600	3508480	with the average rate of growth throughout US history. All up, the growth of the period of
3508480	3515040	embedded liberalism from 1950 to 1980, where GDP per capita nearly doubled, was actually higher
3515040	3520880	than the growth from the 30 year period after Reagan brought neoliberalism to the US from 1981
3520880	3528000	to 2011, where it only increased by 65%. By starting his graph in 1960 and using simple
3528000	3533200	raw GDP per capita figures, Harris obfuscates this. Though this was probably unintentional and just
3533200	3538880	the result of him not being good at research, because the first result on Google for USA GDP per
3538880	3546240	capita is a graph from the World Bank, which his animation lines up with exactly. The reason why his
3546240	3552320	graph has that rather flat curve during the Bretton Woods era that makes it look like neoliberalism
3552320	3558240	increased GDP per capita at a higher relative rate afterwards is because this graph is of GDP per
3558240	3565120	capita in current US dollars, meaning not adjusted for inflation. So the seemingly flatline growth
3565120	3571920	in the 1960s in Harris's graph is an illusion. Inflation was low and stable, and then it skyrocketed
3571920	3577360	in the 70s and 80s. Even though this money was worth significantly less relatively, as prices
3577360	3583120	had greatly increased, the raw GDP per capita number nonetheless still went up as a result.
3583200	3588400	On Harris's GDP per capita graph, this makes it look like economic growth had shot up from a
3588400	3594240	rather stagnant curve into a straight line, when in reality it was a straight line the whole time.
3594240	3599200	Constant US dollar graphs, like the one that I cited, are adjusted for inflation,
3599200	3605600	and the World Bank website, which is where Harris pulled his graph from, also has their own constant
3605600	3611920	US dollar graph. It's just not the first result on Google. As you can see, it tells quite a different
3611920	3618160	story from the one that he used. So, this is the first actual source that Harris tries to present
3618160	3623440	in this video. Three minutes in, after having already made a ton of claims that were just screaming
3623440	3628240	out to be sourced. It is the first result from Google, and it doesn't actually prove what Harris
3628240	3633600	claims it does. The opposite is actually true, because inflation adjusted versions of this graph
3633600	3640240	disprove his claim that Milton Friedman was right, as GDP per capita did not actually grow any faster
3640240	3646720	after neoliberal reforms. On top of that, GDP per capita used as the only metric here to argue that
3646720	3651680	neoliberal policies were making things better would hardly be enough to prove his claim anyway,
3651680	3656240	even if the data was actually on his side, since that says absolutely nothing about how that
3656240	3661840	income is actually distributed. As you can see, on the odd occasion where Harris does bother to
3661840	3667360	try and source a claim, it can go pretty catastrophically. Harris continues on from here.
3668320	3674160	And it led to huge prosperity in the West, as the US economy exploded.
3675120	3681360	No, the US economy did not explode, and it did not lead to huge prosperity. The economy grew
3681360	3686080	at the average historical rate, yet the average person started receiving less of that growth,
3686080	3693040	proven by real wages falling dramatically, while bottom 50% income share also took a huge nosedive.
3693040	3700000	In my book, personally, that's the exact opposite of huge prosperity. Luckily for him though,
3700000	3704720	Johnny Harris is not beholden to things like actually presenting evidence for his claims,
3704720	3709840	so he can just say whatever he wants and then move on, treating it as if it's true just because he
3709840	3714160	said it, which is exactly what he does throughout the entire video and throughout pretty much all
3714160	3719440	of his videos. Wait a minute, but what about China? Are we talking about China and its economy,
3719440	3724480	you know, the Middle Kingdom, China? So all the US and Western economies are thriving because of this
3724480	3730000	corporate free market capitalism that was taking over the world. Okay, so we're finally back to
3730000	3736320	China, and he prefaces this segment by again confidently stating that the West was thriving
3736320	3742320	thanks to corporate free market capitalism. It's like he's trying to wheel his version of history
3742320	3746800	into existence by just repeating it over and over. We've already established that this just
3746800	3751280	isn't true. What's interesting about those statements to me is the taking over the world
3751280	3756320	part because neoliberalism was bad for workers in the West, but it was even worse for people
3756320	3762000	elsewhere in the world. By focusing so much on the West, Harris misses the forest for the trees.
3762000	3767280	While neoliberals came to power via elections in much of the Western world, neoliberalism was
3767280	3772720	imposed by usually US-backed dictatorships in other places. As David Harvey wrote,
3772720	3778160	How was neoliberalization accomplished and by whom? The answer in countries such as Chile
3778160	3784720	and Argentina in the 1970s was as simple as it was swift, brutal, and sure. A military coup
3784720	3789760	backed by the traditional upper classes as well as by the US government, followed by the fierce
3789760	3794720	repression of all solidarities created within the labor and urban social movements which had
3794720	3800320	so threatened their power. So the neoliberal turn for the rest of the world went even worse,
3800320	3807520	while the Americans, Brits, French, Australians, etc. were merely misled into voting for neoliberalism.
3807520	3813040	For many others outside of the West and outside of the global North, the turn was much more violent,
3813040	3818960	being instituted by usually US-backed dictatorships or through coercive loans from international
3818960	3824960	institutions, aka front organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, with conditions that
3824960	3830800	forced the recipients to adopt neoliberal reforms. Many of the countries who received these loans,
3830800	3835600	such as Mozambique, had only recently gained independence from colonial rule and were in
3835600	3841040	a similar situation to what Europe was in after World War II, in desperate needs of funds to
3841040	3846480	rebuild. So they simply had no other choice. The same policies were implemented in these countries
3846480	3853760	as in Chile, the US, and UK with similar effects. Increases in the income share of the rich and
3853760	3859760	decreases in the income share of everyone else. But in that case, neoliberalism fostered not just
3859760	3865520	the redistribution of wealth from workers to local rich people, but also from workers to
3865520	3872720	capitalists in the West, and particularly the US. Now, let's finally see what Harris has to say
3872720	3878320	about China. So while the US and Western economies are thriving because of this corporate free market
3878320	3884400	capitalism that was taking over the world, China was descending further and further into decline.
3884400	3888800	Instead of joining the capitalism party that the West was spreading throughout the world,
3888800	3896720	China resisted, turning to a one-party rule communist system, headed by this guy, Mao Zedong,
3896720	3902720	who destroyed any chance of China's economy ever joining the prosperity happening around the world.
3902720	3909600	By the 1970s, China was a place of widespread poverty, the once prosperous kingdom had reached
3909600	3915920	rock bottom. This part is really something. So the West was apparently prospering due to
3915920	3921120	corporate free market capitalism, right? And it was spreading this around the world,
3921120	3925520	just kind of out of the goodness of its heart. They just wanted everyone else to enjoy free
3925520	3931040	market capitalism too. But unfortunately, China was ruled by Mao and the communists,
3931040	3936560	who were just too stupid and evil to press the big red button marked prosperity and join this
3936560	3942880	capitalism party. Instead of joining this feisty fiesta, they decided to instead press the poverty
3942880	3949680	button, and then they hit rock bottom as a result. This is the most generic, propagandistic rhetoric
3949680	3955920	imaginable. It's precisely how American propaganda has always framed its enemies. Their actions simply
3955920	3961520	can't be explained in any way, but by them being innately evil. Because who in their right mind
3961520	3967200	would oppose the freedom and prosperity that we so generously want to bring them? The entire recent
3967200	3973760	history of China, like, you know, colonialism and war, which had left the country in destitute poverty
3973760	3978800	long before the communists had ever taken power, is glossed over in order to make it seem like
3978800	3983920	there was no possible rational explanation for why China might have been a bit skeptical of the
3983920	3989840	western capitalism. Rather, China just had two buttons. One that said good things, and one that
3989840	3996320	said bad things. And they pressed the latter because Mao is evil and hates prosperity. A vague,
3996320	4002240	undefined, positive sounding term that Harris repeats throughout the video to signal to the
4002240	4007440	audience when they're supposed to like or dislike something. The implication of this is that any
4007440	4012640	country that's poor is poor simply because its leaders want it to be. For Johnny Harris,
4012640	4017840	things need to be this simple, because his video is a propaganda piece made on behalf of the world's
4017840	4022720	worst billionaires. It's best for him to be uncritical and unthinking and just try to win the
4022720	4028480	viewer over with sophistry, because basic things like evidence and rudimentary logic aren't on
4028480	4034160	his side. There's three other things that I want to address about this part. One, Mao was in power
4034160	4041760	from 1949 to 1976, entirely during the embedded liberalism period, which as we've already gone
4041760	4048480	over, was not characterized by corporate free market capitalism. So if there was prosperity in
4048480	4054240	the west during this time, it was due to something quite different than that. Harris once again screws
4054240	4061040	up his chronology for like the 20th time in this video. Two, Harris refers to the Cold War period,
4061040	4066800	in which the west was aggressively spreading capitalism throughout the world as the capitalism
4066800	4072000	party, as if this was something altruistic and as if every other country was free to just copy
4072000	4077840	what they were doing and was positioned to be able to do so. This was anything but the case. The vast
4077840	4083520	majority of countries at this time had no industrial base whatsoever from which to build such a system
4083520	4088880	off, let alone one nearly as advanced as it was in most western countries. Many of them were also
4088880	4095360	still colonies or recently liberated former colonies. Most were also overwhelmingly agrarian,
4095440	4101600	with populations made up mostly of peasants and economies based around primary products like raw
4101600	4107600	resources or agricultural goods. In short, they were really in no position to just copy what the
4107600	4113040	richest countries were doing at the time one to one. They needed to industrialize from scratch,
4113040	4118320	but the west wouldn't let them. The U.S. in particular very aggressively prevented other
4118320	4123280	countries from replicating anything resembling the policies that characterized the embedded
4123280	4129200	liberalism era, like the regulation of markets, controls on capital flows, and forcing companies
4129200	4134880	to compromise with workers. Those sorts of policies were reserved for themselves and their allies only.
4134880	4139840	When other poor countries tried to industrialize in much the same ways that they had, tried to
4139840	4144560	regulate the ability of foreign countries to extract their resources, or did pretty much
4144560	4150320	anything aimed at curbing the power of corporations to better conditions for normal people, the USA
4150320	4156480	and their allies would step in to try and stop or at least impede their progress. Guatemala,
4156480	4162400	Indonesia, and Iran are just free examples out of the many countries they targeted that were
4162400	4167920	trying to pursue regulated capitalist paths to development because that was inconvenient for
4167920	4172320	the profit of the west. So they intervened to ensure that they were violently stopped from
4172320	4178240	doing so, with at least hundreds of thousands of people being killed as a result. So there was no
4178240	4183680	capitalism party that was just open to be joined. Harris' characterization of events is not just
4183680	4189360	simplified, it is outright wrong and intentionally misleading propaganda. At least I hope it is
4189360	4194160	because I really hope that he's not this dumb. He needs to have a simplistic villain who solely
4194160	4200240	threw their own personal, irrational evil, prevented China from joining the good guys and doing
4200240	4206240	capitalism to become prosperous because the reality casts this supposed party of free market
4206240	4213280	capitalism in a much less flattering light. Free. The Maoist period in China was definitely
4213280	4219520	not rock bottom. Living standards actually improved greatly during it and the overall economy expanded
4219520	4225040	at a decent, steady rate, even despite major catastrophes like the Great Leap Forward. GDP
4225040	4230640	per capita grew by about 2% per year, which is not incredible or anything, but still better than
4230640	4235440	before, and around the same as the average growth rate of the US economy throughout its history.
4235440	4240000	This economic growth data also has to be considered with the caveat that the Chinese economy at the
4240000	4244720	time was run fundamentally differently. Its income was allocated more equally and it had
4244720	4250240	provisions for basic needs that GDP, designed to measure economic activity in a market economy,
4250240	4256320	can fail to account for. GDP is already a highly imperfect way of measuring production even in
4256320	4262560	a capitalist country. In a socialist and largely agrarian, non-market one, it's even less useful.
4262560	4268400	More direct indicators of living standards are much more useful. By 1978, peasants were earning
4268400	4274160	more than double the raw income they had earned in 1954, a trend confirmed by its replication
4274160	4279440	across multiple different data sets and metrics. Raw income among the urban population doubled
4279440	4284240	as well. This is also corroborated by the doubling of real expenditure per individual,
4284240	4290080	meaning how much money the average individual person was spending per year adjusted for inflation.
4290080	4294960	The purchasing power of the average person doubling in less than 30 years is at least
4294960	4301600	a half decent increase in prosperity, in my opinion. Daily caloric intake increased. Life
4301600	4309840	expectancy shot up very rapidly, rising from 40 in 1953 to 65 in 1978. Infant mortality dropped
4309840	4317600	from 175 deaths per 1,000 births to 37 per 1,000. Access to education was greatly expanded,
4317600	4325840	with primary school enrollment rates increasing from 48% in 1952 to 94% in 1978. Literacy rates
4325840	4331680	also correspondingly increased rapidly. So, contrary to Harris' fairytale narrative of
4331680	4337040	there just being a big bad man who hated good things for no apparent reason, the Communist
4337040	4344080	Party at the time both wanted to make China more prosperous and did so. Assuming here that prosperity
4344080	4348960	means living standards improving, Harris never actually tells us what he means by that word,
4348960	4354800	so I'm kind of guessing. And it certainly wasn't anywhere near rock bottom, especially not compared
4354800	4359760	to the previous hundred years or so, which were full of war and colonization, much of it at the
4359760	4365680	hands of these same Western capitalist countries that Harris spends most of his video praising.
4365680	4372880	I also want to note that the photos that Harris uses here are not actually of the 1970s as he claims,
4372880	4378880	but rather from the 1900s to the 1940s. They're squarely from the period of nationalist, aka
4378880	4384720	Western-aligned, rule. It seems like he went looking for photos of poverty from the 1970s to
4384720	4389760	back up his argument, but wasn't able to find them, so decided to instead present photos from
4389760	4395680	before the Communist ever came to power as evidence of them being bad. Kind of slimy, dude.
4395680	4402000	Next, Harris moves on to China's market reforms in the late 1970s under Deng Xiaoping,
4402000	4406800	because the entire point of him even talking about the Mao era was just to make it sound as
4406800	4411840	horrible and illogical and evil as possible, to then frame everything that followed it as even
4411840	4416400	more amazing in comparison. The worse that he can make the former sound, the better the latter
4416400	4422240	sounds in contrast, helping with the overarching, childish, uncritical celebration of free market
4422240	4427760	capitalism as some sort of magic narrative of the video. The once prosperous kingdom
4427760	4431200	had reached rock bottom, but that was all about to change.
4434480	4442000	So it's the 1970s and this is China's new leader, Deng Xiaoping. He came into power hoping to turn
4442000	4449680	around this 150 years of humiliation in China, the decline of China as a superpower. Elsewhere in the
4449680	4456080	region, China's neighbors had economies that joined the global economic party that was happening
4456320	4462880	in capitalism and they were thriving. They saw immense economic miracles and pulled millions
4462880	4468480	out of poverty. Really all he does is just make statements and then use positive sounding adjectives
4468480	4474080	to tell the audience what they're supposed to think and feel. Thriving economic miracles.
4474080	4478880	The reality of what happened in these countries is nowhere near as simplistic as Harris needed to
4478880	4484640	be for his propaganda to work. Singapore and Hong Kong, for example, are tiny city-states.
4484640	4490080	Used as hubs for global finance and trade due to their unique status as separate jurisdictions
4490080	4494880	from much larger neighboring countries. And they only even came to have this status in the first
4494880	4500000	place due to unique historical circumstances related to colonialism. That's not something that
4500000	4504960	can at all be replicated in the vast majority of countries, let alone a massive one like China.
4504960	4510480	And whether replicating it would even be desirable at all is also very questionable. Given that Hong
4510480	4515440	Kong, despite its very high levels of gross wealth, has one of the worst poverty rates in the
4515440	4520400	entire global north and hundreds of thousands of people who live in what are basically cages
4520400	4525200	because they can't afford anything else. Singapore is also hardly a model of the
4525200	4530720	corporate free market capitalism that Harris is trying to promote. Singapore is widely considered
4530720	4536160	in the academic literature to have developed via state capitalism. A highly government-directed
4536160	4541040	form of capitalism with considerable state control and ownership of important sectors
4541040	4546320	of the economy. They directed economic policy and leveraged state power at every step of the
4546320	4551840	way, which resulted in the government being the most important economic actor in the country by far.
4551840	4557440	This has resulted in an economy where, quoting a paper on the matter, the shareholder-centric
4557440	4564320	corporation virtually does not exist and where the state owns 37% of the stock market capitalization,
4564320	4571040	95% of the land, 80% of the housing, etc. Quite contrary to Harris's notion of
4571040	4576800	shareholder capitalism having created prosperity. Of the other countries that Harris points to,
4576800	4583040	the three most worth looking at are Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Due to the context of the Cold
4583040	4588160	War and the end of World War II, the USA attempted to bring all of these countries under its hegemony
4588160	4592880	by providing them with considerable economic aid like it had with the Marshall Plan in Western
4592880	4598240	Europe. Because of this, they were able to pursue levels of state economic intervention and planning
4598240	4603280	that weren't nearly as tolerated in countries not aligned with the West. And this state direction
4603280	4609040	was pervasive, especially in Taiwan and South Korea, which were ruled by outright military
4609040	4614800	dictatorships all the way up until the late 80s and early 90s. South Korea had straight up,
4614800	4622240	actual five-year plans inspired by the USSR all the way up until the 1990s, painting their economic
4622240	4628160	growth as due to the simple wonders of free market capitalism is very misleading. Economist
4628160	4634480	Ha Jun Chang commented on the common misconception that these countries followed mainstream free
4634480	4639920	market style policies. Many of the things that the East Asian government officials did in the
4639920	4645120	miracle years, protecting infant industries, forcefully mobilizing resources away from
4645120	4650560	technologically stagnant agriculture into the dynamic industrial sector, and exploiting the
4650560	4656480	linkages across different sectors, contradict the free market view. Had the East Asian countries,
4656480	4661360	and indeed most of the rich countries in Europe and North America before them, run their economies
4661360	4665520	according to the principles of free market economics, they would not have developed their
4665520	4670640	economies in the way they have. All of this is especially true of the period that Harris is
4670640	4675840	covering here. These countries did eventually adopt neoliberal dogma in the 80s and 90s,
4675840	4679680	dialing back the state intervention that had characterized their economies throughout the
4679680	4686560	50s, 60s, and 70s. But the Chinese government's market reforms happened in the 1970s, so clearly
4686560	4692640	they were not inspired by what he calls corporate free market capitalism in East Asia because it
4692640	4697360	didn't exist there yet. I've said this already but it's worth repeating. Harris's content,
4697360	4702880	and indeed a lot of other content on YouTube, relies a whole lot on just confidently stating
4702880	4707840	things that aren't true as if they are. Without even trying to actually substantiate these claims
4707840	4712960	either, they're acting like the point has been proven regardless, and moving on to making another
4712960	4718160	fundamentally incorrect statement that also rests on the previous one, and all of the others
4718160	4724320	before that, having been true. So his whole narrative here of free market capitalist prosperity
4724320	4728400	has been crafted on a very, very long chain of falsehoods.
4729040	4736080	Deng specifically went on a visit to Singapore early on in his term, where ethnic Chinese had
4736080	4742480	adopted the free market, and they were thriving. He felt inspired. The malice economic doctrine
4742480	4748480	that had failed was over, and it was time to see if China could rebuild its economy,
4749040	4754720	experimenting with some version of capitalism. People didn't adopt the free market. That's
4754720	4759680	not how this works. You can't just individually decide that you want to do free market capitalism.
4759680	4764000	No more than I can just individually decide that I want to do communism. These are overarching
4764000	4769520	socioeconomic systems, not individual choices. These people lived under capitalism not because
4769520	4773680	they had adopted it, but rather just because they happened to live in a capitalist society.
4773680	4778960	But yeah, we've already been over what Singapore actually is and was, which conflicts greatly with
4778960	4783920	Harris's narrative here. What do you think it was that Chinese government officials may have seen
4783920	4788400	when they visited Singapore? That Chinese people are capable of running businesses,
4788400	4792960	like they have some sort of essential business running essence or something that they want to
4792960	4799280	wear off before, or a state-led economy that they might have been able to learn something from
4799280	4804240	for their own state-led economic reforms in their country? You don't need to think about it very
4804240	4809600	hard to arrive at the latter conclusion, because the first option is kind of ridiculous, and that
4809680	4814560	is in fact the case. The Communist Party came to see Singapore as something of a reference,
4814560	4820320	precisely because it was an example of an already existing model in which the state remained economically
4820320	4826560	dominant. But apart from that, Harris's timeline is again just totally messed up. Deng visited
4826560	4833040	Singapore in 1978, the same year in which the economic reforms in China began, but he and other
4833040	4838720	Chinese officials didn't start to promote Singapore as a special model to be followed in China
4838720	4843920	until 1992. Before that, it was just one of many different places that they'd studied,
4843920	4849840	so their decision to begin market reforms itself has really nothing to do with Singapore. For Harris,
4849840	4855040	though, it's very convenient to reduce a complicated, multi-causal decision, one which was
4855040	4860320	itself the result of power struggles in the Communist Party, to a simple Eureka-style moment
4860320	4866720	of epiphany. After decades of the evil Mao denying his people prosperity, along with other positive
4866720	4872880	sounding nouns, Deng saw the glory of the free market firsthand in Singapore, and he was so
4872880	4878400	awed by its incredible greatness that he had no choice but to go home and immediately replicate
4878400	4884400	it. It comes off as a childish, apocryphal propaganda story because it is one. In reality,
4884400	4889520	the reforms were already underway beforehand, the visit to Singapore was very short and uneventful,
4889520	4894240	the Chinese government only started paying special attention to Singapore 14 years later,
4894240	4899200	and the reason they did so didn't actually have much to do with free market capitalism at all,
4899200	4905120	rather something quite antifical to it. China's turn to a market-based but still state-dictated
4905120	4910480	economy has infinitely more to do with other factors, like the aforementioned political conflicts,
4910480	4915280	chiefly among them the one of the Soviet Union. So yeah, firstly, there was that,
4915280	4921440	which led to China and the USA establishing diplomatic relations again in 1972. Before this,
4921440	4927040	the People's Republic of China had no access to international governance systems like the UN,
4927040	4931280	as they were mostly controlled by the West, who had still considered the Republic of China
4931280	4936640	government in Taiwan as the legitimate government of all of China. So suddenly, all of the world's
4936640	4942160	most important and richest markets, made up of many countries who had spent the previous century
4942160	4948080	colonizing China and most of the rest of the world, were now finally open to China. This was a drastic
4948160	4953120	and sudden change in circumstances that enabled options that were previously closed to them,
4953120	4958160	like foreign investment from the advanced capitalist countries and the ability to export to them.
4958160	4963840	Second, Deng Xiaoping had been inspired by the new economic policy of the Soviet Union.
4963840	4968560	After the Russian Revolution, the Soviet government under Lenin decided that because
4968560	4974320	the country was overwhelmingly agrarian, much like China was, that they would allow a state-directed
4974400	4979040	capitalism in the hopes of developing an advanced industrial capitalist society,
4979040	4983920	because Karl Marx had theorized that that would be something of a prerequisite for communism.
4983920	4989440	This was highly successful, as the USSR rapidly recovered from the devastation of its civil war
4989440	4995600	and World War I. In 1961, following the disastrous attempt at rapid industrialization known as the
4995600	5001840	Great Leap Forward, Deng was then already the key player in an ill-fated attempt to implement
5001840	5007120	NEP-style reforms in China, to industrialize China in a very different way to the one that Mao
5007120	5013520	had just tried. So the idea before the market reforms that he started to implement in 1978
5013520	5018560	was not actually new at all, not in the history of China, nor in the history of communism,
5018560	5024160	nor even in Deng's own political career. So the international conditions that enabled China's
5024160	5030400	market reforms only came to be in the 1970s, and that clearest precedent and inspiration didn't
5030400	5037040	come from the West in the 1970s, but from the East in the 1920s, and they had been proposed in China
5037040	5042800	since at least the 1960s. If it isn't already clear from everything that we've just gone over,
5042800	5048960	Harris' narrative of China joining the capitalist party in the West is also just plain chronologically
5048960	5055600	impossible. He clearly means to imply that China was inspired by free markets, neoliberal capitalism,
5055600	5060320	rather than the embedded liberalism of the Bretton Woods period, given his constant references to
5060400	5065440	arch neoliberal Milton Friedman, his earlier delineation between the Bretton Woods period
5065440	5070320	and the neoliberal period that came after, and the fact that he outright praises free market
5070320	5075760	capitalism like a dozen times, actually more than that. But China's reforms actually started
5075760	5082880	before the turn to neoliberalism in the West. They started in 1978. Thatcher was elected in 1979,
5082880	5088560	Reagan in 1981, so they couldn't have been inspired by Friedman-style neoliberal reforms there,
5088560	5093360	because they hadn't even been implemented on a national level yet. In this video, it really
5093360	5098800	seems like Harris has like an uncontrollable desire to use the term West as synonymous with
5098800	5103920	correct and good. His presentation of the world is one where it's just kind of self-evident,
5103920	5109520	that the only way forward is to copy the superior West. If something happened that he considers to
5109520	5114800	be good, he does everything possible to ultimately credit it to Western influences or inspirations,
5114800	5119440	without feeling any sort of need to actually back that up, or check whether his argument even
5119440	5123840	makes any chronological sense, or consider the possibility that Chinese people might be
5123840	5129280	capable of thinking for themselves, having their own ideas, or being inspired by anything other
5129280	5134160	than the same countries that had colonized and devastated their own. This is juxtaposed with
5134160	5138800	his treatment of Mao, who was apparently just completely irrational and evil, because that's
5138800	5144000	the only way that Harris can apparently think of that could possibly explain someone not simply
5144000	5149600	copying the superior West. It comes off as at least a little bit racist. In the next bit,
5149600	5155360	Harris reduces all of Deng's market reforms to just him focusing on one little village,
5155360	5160480	the special economic zone of Shenzhen. He frames it like Deng started out by creating a little
5160480	5165760	secret capitalist project, developing this one town into a bustling industrial city. But the
5165760	5171280	reality is that this was just one small part of a much wider reform program, which also included
5171280	5175920	free other special economic zones established in free other places at the same time. So why
5175920	5182400	does he focus on it so heavily? This remark makes it clear. Deng Xiaoping designated this little town
5182400	5189680	as quote a special economic zone, where foreign companies could set up and invest in a very
5189680	5195360	capitalistic free market, claiming China's highly regulated very state directed system,
5195360	5200480	as some sort of success of free market capitalism would obviously be ridiculous. So in an attempt
5200480	5206240	to get around this complication, Harris, providing no evidence for his claims at all, says that Shenzhen
5206240	5210560	had a free market, and then he just casually acts like that represented the rest of China,
5210560	5215040	and that it was replicated everywhere else. Despite having done absolutely nothing to even
5215040	5220880	remotely argue for or evidence this extremely false claim, he then uses it as the basis to
5220880	5226800	claim China as a whole as a victory of the same type of free market capitalism that Milton Friedman
5227440	5232720	This starts happening all over China, and meanwhile Milton Friedman's back in the U.S. being like
5234880	5241840	Yep. Told ya. Soon there were a bunch of cities designated in China for special economic activity
5241840	5246880	or basically capitalism in a socialist country. Something I haven't mentioned yet is that big
5246880	5251280	parts of his narrative here are just ripped straight from the World Economic Forum propaganda
5251280	5255760	book that is being paid to promote here. I've actually been giving Harris way too much credit.
5255760	5259840	He didn't come up with like half of this stuff himself. The Singapore story,
5259840	5265040	followed immediately by the Shenzhen story, comes straight from the book, but Harris actually went
5265040	5270000	even further than the book did. Its description of China's special economic zones is simply that
5270000	5274560	there are places where foreign companies were allowed to operate with some tax incentives
5274560	5279520	under government-imposed conditions in contrast to the rest of the country where such enterprises
5279520	5285440	were entirely illegal, a surprisingly accurate description, and far from free market capitalism.
5285440	5290160	Sometimes you can just refer back to the very book that he's advertising here and use it to
5290160	5296000	refute him. Anyway, so onto the Milton Friedman part. Friedman absolutely did not approve of
5296000	5300240	China's state-led economy. He certainly may have liked it more than what it had before,
5300240	5305760	but it was far from anything close to resembling his neoliberal ideal. We have direct evidence of
5305760	5310640	this because Friedman actually went to China and spoke with Communist Party officials who outright
5310640	5315120	argued against him about the very fundamentals of his beliefs. They had major disagreements
5315120	5319680	on topics like private property rights, state interference in the market, and state economic
5319680	5325440	planning. If anything, China proved Friedman wrong that the sort of government interference that he
5325440	5330960	so despised could achieve what he'd claimed it couldn't, but Harris, undeterred by the truth,
5330960	5336080	just inverts reality yet again and claims the exact opposite. One of the things you might have noticed
5336080	5340960	that Harris does a lot in this video is to muddy the distinction between different types of capitalism,
5340960	5346000	ironically while also trying to create his own distinction between different types of capitalism.
5346000	5352000	His video is very overtly pro-free market capitalism specifically, yet in one sentence
5352000	5357200	he'll talk about how great the free market is, and then in the next he'll just say capitalism
5357200	5362400	alone. And this last bit about China is where this muddying of the waters came to its head.
5362400	5367840	China has obviously never had anything resembling free market capitalism. Harris pays a tiny little
5367840	5378080	bit of lip service to this fact for like a second, then just forgets that he ever said that and
5378080	5383520	immediately continues on as if China is nonetheless an example of the free market dogma that is trying
5383520	5388160	to promote. It's the same thing that he did earlier when he claimed the Bretton Woods period
5388160	5393280	and the Marshall Plan as examples of miracles of the free market rather than the heavy state
5393360	5398800	economic interference, planning, and control that actually characterizes them. Johnny Harris
5398800	5403680	in the corporations that the World Economic Forum represents probably wouldn't be very happy if we
5403680	5408880	went and looked at the actual reality of China's state-led economy with fairly routine executions
5408880	5413840	of billionaires and took it as a model to be followed, yet such is capitalist propaganda,
5413840	5419360	contradictory by nature. China becoming a world power through heavy state intervention and very
5419440	5424560	directed and deliberate government-led economic policy doesn't fit into their narrative of what
5424560	5429040	kind of economic policies are supposed to work best, so they need to obfuscate those facts and
5429040	5433920	find roundabout ways to claim that it's actually still somehow an example of the wonders of free
5433920	5439760	market capitalism. This video is a fine example of that practice. But wait, I haven't yet actually
5439760	5444640	provided any evidence for my claim that China doesn't have a free market economy. Silly me,
5444640	5450000	allow me to cite a source, a book called Stakeholder Capitalism, by the founder and head
5450000	5456560	of the World Economic Forum. In recent decades, another form of capitalism emerged as an alternative,
5456560	5462480	state capitalism. In China, to take the most notable example, the private sector now produces
5462480	5468240	more than 60% of GDP. Despite this, the state is still considered the most important stakeholder
5468240	5472880	and retains power over individual shareholders. The government achieves its dominant role in at
5472880	5478320	least free ways. First, it keeps a strong hand in the distribution of resources and opportunities.
5478320	5483680	Second, it can intervene in virtually any industry. And third, it can direct the economy
5483680	5489840	by means of large-scale infrastructure, research and development, education, healthcare, or housing
5489840	5497280	projects. So Harris' video is fundamentally based on this idea that China is a success of free market
5497280	5503280	capitalism, of freemanite neoliberalism, to the extent that China supposedly stands as proof
5503280	5508800	that Milton Friedman was right. Yet the book that he was paid to promote in this video says
5508800	5514240	something entirely different. That it's the prime example of something very different to the neoliberalism
5514240	5520240	that it misleadingly calls shareholder capitalism and stakeholder capitalism. The book even gives
5520240	5526080	this state capitalism props, saying that, were it not for state capitalism, large parts of the
5526080	5530960	developing world may not have seen a major growth spurred at all. Yet Harris frames it entirely
5530960	5536400	differently, as if the free market is actually to thank for the perceived successes of state-led
5536400	5541760	interventionist economies. I don't mean to give the book any credit here, it's garbage, ghost-ridden
5541760	5546240	propaganda. It only acknowledges these things because they're undeniable, and it does so to
5546240	5551280	create this false impression of nuance so that the reader is more likely to be convinced by its main
5551280	5555760	argument that the way to fix the problems of neoliberal capitalism is with more neoliberal
5555760	5561200	capitalism, along with a nice helping of giving corporations even more power. I just think it's
5561200	5565760	telling that Harris clearly read the book, given that he both claimed to have done so, and that
5565760	5571200	parts of his video seem to come directly from it. Yet to sustain his argument that everything good
5571200	5577600	ever is all thanks to the West's amazing free market capitalism, he still has to editorialize
5577600	5582880	the World Economic Forum Propaganda Book to get rid of the parts where the book is frank about the
5582880	5587440	fact that the things that he's crediting to the wonders of Milton Friedman are actually due to
5587440	5593920	something very different. Harris's video comes off as even more of a piece of unthinking capitalist
5593920	5599920	propaganda than the literal World Economic Forum Propaganda Book does. Now, let's move on to the
5599920	5605120	big graph moment of the video, which comes out of nowhere after Harris is finally done lying to us
5605120	5608800	about how neoliberal capitalism actually saved the world and made everything better
5608800	5610640	contrary to what all the evidence shows.
5611840	5613200	I have two graphs I want to show you.
5615920	5622880	They look like this. Okay, let's look at this one first. It's called the elephant graph. Do you
5622880	5630400	sort of see why? Let's deconstruct this graph and try to understand what this says about the
5630400	5637040	past 30 years of the rise of China. On this axis is everyone on earth ranked by their income
5637680	5642880	grouped into percentiles. So these people down here make an income that is the 10th percentile,
5642880	5648400	the lowest 10% in the world, and then the 20th percentile, and so on and so on. Up to these
5648400	5652560	people up here who are the richest in the world, they have an income that puts them in the 90th
5652560	5659520	percentile. This axis here shows how much growth in income these people have had over the past 35
5659520	5664480	years, basically during the heyday of shareholder capitalism and the rise of China. So you'll
5664480	5669520	see how this plays out in just a second. Let's start plotting how much income growth each of these
5669520	5677360	groups saw over the past 35 years. The bottom 10% saw their incomes grow by around 75%, not bad.
5677360	5682640	These are people who live in the poorest countries who make the lowest income in the world. The 20
5682640	5690480	to 30 percentile saw huge growth in their income, 125% and more over the past 35 years. This is like
5690480	5696480	the new middle class in China and other Asian countries who saw huge income growth due to
5696480	5701520	globalization. They did really well under this system. Just want to pause for a second here to
5701520	5707120	note how Harris is again claiming China for what he calls shareholder capitalism, despite the very
5707120	5713040	book that he's promoting calling it something very different. But then you start to get to the
5713040	5719840	people in the 50th and 60th and 70th and 80th percentile. This is basically people who live
5719840	5726640	in the middle class in the West. Their incomes have grown much slower, sometimes under 50%
5726640	5733040	over the course of 35 years, which is little over 1% a year, not very much income growth.
5733040	5738560	So did you notice the contradiction there? It's a pretty big one. Harris goes his entire video
5738560	5745280	telling us how awesome shareholder capitalism was for the West, how it made the economy explode,
5745280	5750880	and how it proved Milton Friedman right. But then the graph that his entire video led up to
5751520	5756480	paints a different picture. Now it seems that things actually didn't go that great for people
5756480	5761680	in the West. There's no consistency in this video at all. He just contradicts himself so often.
5761680	5765120	And some of these people in the West have seen their incomes shrink,
5765760	5770400	like the blue-collar workers in Detroit and the rust belt whose jobs disappeared to China.
5770400	5777280	So so far you can sort of see why this makes sense. The people in China who benefited from this mass
5777280	5783520	industrialization saw huge benefits. And the people here in the United States and in the West
5783520	5789920	who saw jobs go overseas to China saw a way slower growth in their income.
5789920	5796160	So this part is kind of ridiculous. Harris blames production moving to China for that portion of
5796160	5800880	the graph having comparatively less growth. But as we've already established, the US economy
5800880	5805520	continued to grow at the same average rate that it always had. And given that the income shares
5805520	5810800	of the top percentiles saw massive increases that work on current with this, it's clear that the
5810800	5815760	extra income from this growth was taken from them and given to the rich in their country,
5815760	5820080	rather than to normal people in China who are at the very bottom end of this graph,
5820080	5824160	Harris just can't seem to help himself here. He has to find some way in which he can blame
5824160	5829040	your woes on Chinese people, rather than the capitalists who are actually to blame because,
5829040	5834000	well, they're paying him to make this video, aren't they? I'll let him finish his spiel on the graph now.
5846560	5851200	get us a little bit more granular. These are the people who have the highest incomes in the world.
5851200	5856400	Let's see how their income has grown over the past 35 years.
5858320	5864560	You can see that their income has exploded under this system. They're seeing tripling of their
5864560	5870400	income in the past 35 years. Now, a reminder that this is 35 years of data from every economy on
5870400	5875680	earth. This shows everyone on the planet. So this gives us a view of who are the winners and the
5875680	5881920	losers of this shareholder capitalism that has globalized to Asia and around the world. The top
5881920	5889280	1% of income earners saw the biggest benefits from this system. They are the ones who disproportionately
5889280	5893680	benefit from shareholder capitalism and the growth of globalization.
5894640	5899040	Again, wait, wasn't this supposed to actually be super awesome for the West?
5899040	5903280	So awesome that it inspired China to copy it all? He said this earlier.
5903280	5907120	So all the US and Western economies are thriving because of this corporate,
5907120	5909680	free market capitalism that was taking over the world.
5909680	5914160	But his own framing of this graph is kind of contradicting that quite a bit.
5915360	5919840	Whatever. Anyway, so you probably won't be too surprised to find that this graph is extremely
5919920	5925920	cherry-picked. It compares income growth rate, not actual income. For an example of why this
5925920	5932240	is not exactly very indicative of anything, let's say you make $1,000 a year and your income increases
5932240	5940880	by, say, 125%, like it did in this part of the graph here. Then you're now making $2,250 a year,
5940880	5948000	$1,250 more. But if someone say from this part of the graph, which Harris claims represents
5948000	5954880	the Western middle class, is making $50,000 a year, and this grows by only 45%, which seems much
5954880	5963920	lower in comparison, then that income has increased to $72,500 a year, or $22,500 more, which in
5963920	5970560	numeric terms is 18 times more than the increase in income of those in the lower percentile.
5970560	5975760	So while that income might be growing at a slower rate, that's not really indicative of anything
5975760	5980480	useful on its own. Those in the middle can still be getting a much larger share of raw
5980480	5985600	global income than those at the bottom. The reason why propagandists like to use this so-called
5985600	5990880	elephant graph, comparing income growth instead of numerical increases in income, is because the
5990880	5996480	latter graph completely destroys the narrative that this elephant graph is used to push, that
5996480	6001920	free market neoliberalism has actually been mostly beneficial and has only been slightly negative for
6001920	6007120	a relatively small group of people in the West. That's wrong, and it would be even if we assumed,
6007120	6012640	for the sake of argument, that China, which makes up the vast majority of the growth in those lower
6012640	6017840	income sections of the graph, has a free market economy. The YouTuber Unlearning Economics has a
6017840	6022960	great video about this whole narrative of neoliberal progress, where he specifically refutes the abuse
6022960	6026240	of the elephant graph, so I'm just going to play that clip to explain it to you more.
6026880	6031520	The elephant shape comes because the gains at the very bottom of the global distribution
6031520	6036240	on the left hand of the graph have been low. Moving right along the x-axis, we can see they
6036240	6040880	are much higher for the global middle class, are low again for the middle class of rich countries,
6040880	6046640	and are high again for the very rich. This paints a picture of globalization as a largely positive,
6046640	6051680	albeit flawed, process, compressing the global income distribution by creating a much larger
6051680	6056560	global middle class, while neglecting the middle classes of the rich world, which have seen high
6056560	6061760	and possibly rising income inequality within their borders. But the elephant graph hides an
6061760	6068080	assumption which is pervasive in these debates. These are relative changes, expressed in percentages.
6068080	6072800	If you look at the raw changes in income, shown on this graph, the income gains are largely
6072800	6077600	flattened at the bottom of the distribution, and the graph takes the familiar hockey stick shape,
6077600	6081600	albeit with a slight bump in the middle, due to the impressive growth of China and other
6081600	6086400	Southeast Asian countries. This is also in Lakhnar and Milanovic's original paper,
6086400	6091680	though the elephant version has been shared more widely. Although incomes rose by 60% for both the
6091680	6096720	top 1%, and those in the middle of the global income distribution, this was an absolute increase
6096720	6104400	of $23,000 for the top 1%, but just $800 for the middle. The rich gained the same in relative terms,
6104400	6109360	but 30 times as much in absolute terms. The elephant shows the former measurement,
6109360	6113840	while the hockey stick shows the latter. The implication of this is pretty clear.
6113840	6118720	Almost all of the growth in the global economy was captured by those at the top of the distribution,
6118720	6123280	failing to go to those who need it most. Yeah, you heard that right. Both of these
6123280	6128800	graphs are from the same paper, yet those who pushed this narrative took one of them and ignored
6128800	6134960	the other. I wonder why? Take a look at the income growth of the bottom 20% here. Their incomes
6134960	6141760	increased by $217 in 30 years, adjusted for inflation, and purchasing power between different
6141760	6147520	countries. Now, what about someone in the top 80%, in line with the western middle class?
6147520	6155920	Their incomes increased by $2,218. 10 times more. Again, this is adjusted for purchasing power parity,
6155920	6160080	so it's not like that money is worthless due to the higher prices of goods in richer countries.
6160080	6165760	It is actually just straight up 10 times more. So clearly, it's not the poor Chinese factory
6165760	6171840	worker whose income has increased by a whopping $217 in 30 years, who's robbed the average
6171840	6176960	westerner of their share of economic growth. It's the people represented on the far right side of
6176960	6183440	the graph, whose incomes increased by 28 times that of the global average. The elephant graph
6183440	6189120	was cherry picked by the World Economic Forum, Harris, and many other propagandists to mask
6189120	6195120	inconvenient facts for their narratives like these. So, Harris started out by claiming that
6195120	6200720	neoliberalism, which he calls shareholder capitalism and free market capitalism, increased
6200720	6206960	economic growth in the west by using a misleading graph of per capita GDP, which was not adjusted
6206960	6212400	for inflation. Now, he's implying that neoliberalism was actually disadvantageous for most people in
6212400	6217760	the west, and that there was a massive redistribution in income from them to the rest of the world,
6217760	6223840	and the richest 1% and up. This narrative is not only incredibly contradictory, but also untrue.
6223840	6229840	There was a massive redistribution in income, yes, but only to the top 1%. The empirical data,
6229840	6235600	no matter what metrics you use, no matter what variables you adjust by, consistently shows this.
6235600	6241120	Neoliberalism has accomplished absolutely nothing but the redistribution of income from the majority
6241120	6247280	of people to the richest people, and it's like that by design. So, next and finally,
6247280	6251280	Harris shows us a graph of global CO2 emissions for some reason.
6251280	6259120	The second graph looks like this. This shows the amount of CO2 emissions by country.
6259760	6264400	You've got Europe and the United States, and then up here you've got China, the world's
6264400	6271600	largest emitter of CO2. Like the elephant graph, this graph combines loads of data to show us that
6271600	6278080	shareholder capitalism focuses so much on short-term profits for shareholders that it leaves out any
6278080	6284800	consideration for how this economic activity affects the planet we live on and our ability to live on it.
6284800	6289360	He makes sure to point out that China now has the world's largest share of global CO2 emissions,
6289360	6293440	when you measure them by country at least, neglecting to mention that until, like,
6293440	6298400	a couple of weeks ago actually, China had the world's largest population, congratulations India,
6298400	6302000	and it still hasn't approached the per capita emissions of the West,
6302000	6306480	and especially not the US, where the average person emits about three times more than the
6306480	6311120	average Chinese person. And given that Harris also noted in his video that
6311120	6317920	And more and more foreign companies flocked to China for its cheap labor. It became the world's factory.
6317920	6323120	Then it would stand to reason that a fair bit of those emissions are also on behalf of the West.
6323120	6326800	Yet they still count against China and not against them.
6326800	6331600	His analysis of this graph is very short and just seems kind of tacked on in superfluous,
6331600	6335040	like he wanted to throw in a token acknowledgement of climate change at the end,
6335040	6339520	so that he could subsequently imply that stakeholder capitalism would magically fix it,
6339520	6344160	while also driving home the general sort of anti-China vibe of this part of the video.
6344160	6349600	Right after him telling us how awesome it was that China finally came to its senses and copied
6349600	6356080	the free market capitalism that's work so great for the West, there's this jarring tone shift.
6356080	6360560	Now it seems that free market capitalism hasn't actually gone that well for the West.
6360560	6364080	China's success also came at the expense of the average Westerner,
6364080	6367520	and China even bears massive blame for climate change.
6367520	6372160	So which is it? Is China an awesome example of free market capitalism success,
6372160	6376560	or a massive threat to the livelihood and well-being of the average person in the West?
6376560	6380240	What's really most jarring about this to me though is that it seems like
6380240	6382800	people don't really notice when he does this.
6382800	6386560	At least from reading the comments, you won't really see anyone picking up on these sorts of
6386560	6391920	contradictions and incoherency. Kind of worrying to me, and I hope that maybe my video will
6391920	6396000	sort of encourage people to consume YouTube content, not just Johnny Harris videos,
6396000	6398880	but all YouTube content with a bit more of a critical eye.
6398880	6404000	Anyway, so it's especially nonsensical for Harris to bring up climate change in this video,
6404000	6407760	because the only actual evidence that he presents throughout the entire video
6407760	6413200	for the supposed success of free market capitalism was that one graph of raw GDP growth.
6413200	6419600	For Harris, growth is just sort of good in of itself, and it improves what he calls prosperity,
6419600	6424240	yet that is precisely the sort of thinking that led to runaway climate change.
6424240	6427920	The reality is that, as the last 40 to 50 years have shown,
6427920	6432560	there is not necessarily an automatic correlation between economic growth
6432560	6437040	and improvements in living standards. Growth just means more national income,
6437040	6442480	and if most or all of that extra income is being distributed straight to the people on top,
6442480	6447200	the benefits for everyone else will be marginal or non-existent, while the costs,
6447200	6452400	like the impending climate catastrophe, will be shouldered primarily by everyone outside of
6452400	6458000	that privileged minority. And this is a big reason why capitalism just is never going to
6458080	6462800	work that well for most people. While, particularly in state-directed forms,
6462800	6468240	it does grow wealth better than the systems that came before it, it also creates a tiny minority
6468240	6474480	of people with immense economic and thus political power, which they then use to ensure two things.
6474480	6479040	One, that efforts at power and income redistribution are stunted as much as possible,
6479040	6482720	so that as much of this growth as possible goes straight to themselves.
6482720	6488320	And two, that this growth continues as unabated as possible in order to ensure themselves as much
6488320	6493520	income as possible, even as this makes the planet increasingly less habitable for humans.
6493520	6498480	The World Economic Forum is the most important representative body of exactly that class of
6498480	6503920	people, and Johnny Harris was paid by them to make this video about how awesome economic growth has
6503920	6509520	supposedly been throughout the last 40 to 50 years or so, you know, with some very minor caveats,
6509520	6513920	like runaway climate change and immense inequality that they only acknowledged because
6513920	6518720	they're now completely impossible to deny. But don't worry, they swear they'll fix them for
6518720	6523760	us out of the goodness of their hearts if we just adopt their vision of a new form of capitalism,
6523760	6527840	which is not only fundamentally the same as the old form of capitalism, but which would
6527840	6532160	also just so happen to hand them, the ones who cause these problems in the first place,
6532160	6538000	copious amounts of additional direct governmental power. Yeah, that sounds like a great idea.
6538000	6542960	Anyway, so after the CO2 emissions graph part, the conclusion that we dissected at the beginning
6542960	6547600	of the video begins. So we're pretty much done here. There's really just little about this video
6547600	6553040	that makes any sense without the context of it just being a particularly poorly made propaganda
6553040	6557360	piece. It's just a guy presenting a very disjointed historical narrative with massive
6557360	6562640	unexplained time skips that's very loosely based on reality, where he insists that free market
6562640	6567520	capitalism is responsible for anything good that's ever happened, while presenting nothing but a few
6567520	6573520	misleading graphs or just outright lying to sustain that narrative. Then at the end, he pulls out
6573520	6578240	more misleading graphs, contradicts everything that he just spent seven whole minutes telling you,
6578240	6583040	and then insists that the only way forward is to do exactly what the world's worst corporations
6583040	6588800	tell us to do. It is utterly embarrassing that Johnny Harris frames himself as a journalist
6588800	6594320	who according to him does copious amounts of research for his videos, including this one,
6594320	6598720	where he gets pretty much everything wrong, provides next to no evidence for his claims,
6598720	6603840	and messes up to a comical level when he does actually try to provide a source. And this video
6603840	6609120	is indicative of the quality of research across his entire channel. It's garbage. But unfortunately,
6609120	6613760	it seems to work regardless because he gets a whole lot of views. And as the link for this
6613760	6619760	response video makes clear, it takes infinitely more effort to refute made up bullshit than the
6619760	6625280	effort that goes into making up the bullshit. In conclusion, Johnny Harris is a liar. Worse.
6625280	6631200	His lies are about as complex as lying to a child that babies are delivered to your doorstep by stalks.
6631200	6637200	Way worse. He took money to lie and mislead on behalf of one of the world's most nefarious and
6637200	6643040	damaging, ultra-rich advocacy organizations, and even seemed proud of doing so when he was called
6643040	6647040	out on it. If there's anything actually useful that you should take from this video beyond that,
6647040	6652480	it's one, that neoliberalism actually sucks, and that other forms of capitalism pretty much
6652480	6658000	suck too, though quite a bit less, and two, that all of the problems that I've outlined here about
6658000	6663520	Johnny Harris's content are not actually unique to his content. The vast majority of YouTube
6663520	6669280	infotainment, particularly historical infotainment, is exactly the same. It's just people who make
6669280	6673520	confident-sounding statements that the audience is just supposed to take for granted because
6673520	6678800	they said so. It's rare for them to even explain their reasoning, let alone provide anything resembling
6678800	6684080	adequate evidence for it. The average YouTube history video is so bad that treating it as
6684080	6688480	anything more than background noise while you clean the house or something is a huge mistake.
6688480	6692480	That's all for now. If you liked this video and want to see more like it, then subscribe
