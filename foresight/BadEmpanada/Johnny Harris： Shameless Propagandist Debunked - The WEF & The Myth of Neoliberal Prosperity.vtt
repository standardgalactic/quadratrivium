00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
If you watch political or historical content on YouTube, you're probably aware of Johnny Harris.

00:05.120 --> 00:09.520
He's hard to miss because YouTube's algorithm recommends his videos a lot.

00:09.520 --> 00:14.800
Back in 2021, the YouTuber Tom Nicholas made a video about Harris getting sponsored by the

00:14.800 --> 00:20.160
World Economic Forum to make a video promoting a book they wrote. Tom used that video, called

00:20.160 --> 00:25.520
How China Became So Powerful, as an example of how money can be used to get seemingly independent

00:25.520 --> 00:30.880
YouTubers to make paid propaganda. Harris then responded in the comment section. He admitted

00:30.880 --> 00:35.600
that the video was made in partnership with the WEF, but said that he didn't see a problem with it.

00:35.600 --> 00:39.920
Then in another comment, he bemoaned the fact that no one was taking the actual argument of

00:39.920 --> 00:45.840
his video seriously. According to him, he'd done exhaustive research, sifting through lots of data

00:45.840 --> 00:50.400
to make that video, and people were just using the fact that it was made on behalf of the WEF

00:50.400 --> 00:54.960
as an excuse to avoid engaging with its actual content. Johnny should have been careful what he

00:54.960 --> 00:59.520
wished for because it's come true. In this video, we're going to be refuting the actual content

00:59.520 --> 01:04.560
of the video in question, which is not very good to say the least. If it was actually the result

01:04.560 --> 01:10.320
of him spending loads of time researching, then his research skills should be seriously questioned.

01:17.440 --> 01:21.600
This video was made possible thanks to my supporters on Patreon and Ko-fi.

01:22.400 --> 01:26.720
This video is broadly indicative of Harris' content in general. He likes to act like he's

01:26.720 --> 01:31.840
teaching you something new, profound, and different. Hidden knowledge of the powers that be have kept

01:31.840 --> 01:36.960
on the down low. Things that go against the status quo and the taken for granted opinions that most

01:36.960 --> 01:42.400
people hold. In reality, though, most of his videos are simplistic slump that serve precisely to

01:42.400 --> 01:47.840
direct the audience towards conclusions that uphold the status quo, either through obfuscation,

01:47.840 --> 01:53.680
or, as in the case of this video, by outright supporting it. They're usually just barrages

01:53.680 --> 01:58.080
of rapid fire statements that Harris, and whoever works for him because he's definitely not making

01:58.080 --> 02:03.120
these videos by himself, make little to no effort to actually explain, let alone back up with any

02:03.120 --> 02:06.880
sources. Before you can think about what he's saying and the fact that he's not really giving

02:06.880 --> 02:10.960
you any reason to even believe it, he's already moved on to telling you what to think about something

02:10.960 --> 02:16.800
else, while stock footage plays with inspiring music and camera roll sound effects in the background.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.920
Here's an illustrative example from the video in question.

02:19.920 --> 02:27.360
This was China, the Middle Kingdom, and right next door, India. This was the center of the global

02:27.360 --> 02:32.160
economic universe, but around the 1800s, that started changing.

02:35.680 --> 02:41.040
Over here in Europe and the United States, there was a major revolution that started taking place.

02:41.360 --> 02:50.480
Science, then machines, then weapons, trains, cars, flight, bombs, factories, cities,

02:50.480 --> 02:56.720
and with their new power, these countries started to expand to take over large swaths of the map.

02:57.600 --> 03:02.160
China remained a great civilization, but as the West started showing up,

03:02.160 --> 03:07.760
knocking on China's door with their big guns, China couldn't really match their firepower,

03:07.760 --> 03:11.600
and they had to concede land to Britain, which is how we got Hong Kong.

03:12.240 --> 03:16.160
The Industrial Revolution didn't really happen in China the same way it did in the West,

03:16.800 --> 03:22.400
and by the middle of the 1800s, China began a massive decline in its economic standing in the

03:22.400 --> 03:27.360
world. A century later, that situation got way worse, as China was invaded by its neighbor,

03:27.360 --> 03:33.920
Japan. China's economy was no longer the prosperous Middle Kingdom, but rather a shadow of itself,

03:33.920 --> 03:40.320
a poor country that was being occupied by outsiders. Once World War II was over, the West

03:40.320 --> 03:46.400
devised a new global economic and financial system. It was modeled after the economic system that

03:46.400 --> 03:51.840
was working so well in the West, capitalism, free enterprise. That's really the essence of

03:51.840 --> 03:57.200
Johnny Harris right there, a flurry of no context statements thrown out with little explanation and

03:57.200 --> 04:01.840
backed up by nothing more than stock footage and his word. In the course of about 90 seconds,

04:01.840 --> 04:05.440
he describes China as having been one of the most powerful countries in the world.

04:05.440 --> 04:11.120
Then industrialization just sort of magically happening, which subsequently enabled the West

04:11.120 --> 04:18.480
to get stronger, expand, and attack China. Then there's a 100 year time skip. It's now 1945,

04:18.480 --> 04:25.360
and oh, Japan is invading China now, yes? So China is suddenly relatively weak now,

04:25.360 --> 04:30.880
and oh, there's capitalism too apparently. What a ride that was. Harris has all of this

04:30.880 --> 04:36.240
completely backwards. He presents the industrial revolution like it's what enabled the European

04:36.240 --> 04:41.680
colonialism that he refers to as expansion. Yet said colonialism predated the industrial

04:41.680 --> 04:47.600
revolution, which began in the 18th century by hundreds of years. So it was the colonialism

04:47.600 --> 04:52.800
that enabled the industrial revolution, not the other way around. The historian Eric Williams

04:52.800 --> 04:58.000
showed via exhaustive archival research that the profits that funded much of the first industrial

04:58.000 --> 05:02.560
revolution, and thus led to everything that came afterwards, came from British slave colonies in

05:02.560 --> 05:08.000
the Caribbean. And that's just one small example of how the murder, subjugation, and dispossession

05:08.000 --> 05:11.920
of much of the rest of the world is what the West's economic power and the development of

05:11.920 --> 05:17.040
capitalism was built on. So it was colonialism elsewhere that gave the Western countries the

05:17.040 --> 05:22.560
advantages that they needed to subsequently colonize China and eliminate it as a competitor,

05:22.560 --> 05:27.440
rather than just some magical sudden explosion of technology and science that they then took

05:27.440 --> 05:33.600
advantage of. I love how he actually verbatim just exclaims science. It's like a Tim and Eric

05:33.600 --> 05:40.240
skit. Science. So huge L to China for making the fatal mistake of not killing, robbing,

05:40.240 --> 05:44.880
and enslaving people on the other side of the world to spur their own industrial revolution.

05:44.880 --> 05:50.000
The main narrative throughout this video is that free market capitalism is amazing. So his reasons

05:50.000 --> 05:54.560
for skipping over what actually happened so egregiously can be deduced pretty easily. It's

05:54.560 --> 06:00.000
a lot easier to make a video celebrating capitalist free enterprise if you ignore the much less

06:00.000 --> 06:04.880
savoury reality of how it came to be. And he especially needed to do this because the World

06:04.880 --> 06:09.920
Economic Forum probably wouldn't be very happy about a video that presents the early development

06:09.920 --> 06:15.280
of capitalism and capitalism in general for that matter in anything but a glowing light.

06:15.280 --> 06:20.480
The final bit of that clip and what comes after it is particularly characteristic of the often

06:20.480 --> 06:27.760
chaotic poorly structured zero substance nature of Johnny Harris's videos. The West devised a new

06:27.760 --> 06:33.680
global economic and financial system. It was modeled after the economic system that was working so

06:33.680 --> 06:39.280
well in the West. Capitalism. Free enterprise. Still with some government oversight and high

06:39.280 --> 06:44.320
taxes for the rich and corporations, but it was still capitalism. So there's a 100 a year time

06:44.320 --> 06:50.720
skipped to 1945 and capitalism is only being introduced now. Not with the industrial revolution

06:50.720 --> 06:55.360
of two centuries beforehand, which he covered about a minute earlier. He then tells us that

06:55.360 --> 07:01.200
before this, this capitalism was working so well in the West. But this is contradicted by the very

07:01.200 --> 07:06.720
fact that what he's describing here is the Bretton Woods economic system established by the USA and

07:06.720 --> 07:10.800
other Western countries at the end of World War II. Though you might have missed that because he

07:10.800 --> 07:16.320
just glosses over all the details entirely. He just flashes Bretton Woods on the screen and explains

07:16.320 --> 07:21.600
nothing about it beyond it apparently involving more government oversight and higher taxes on the

07:21.600 --> 07:27.040
rich. The post war Western economic order, which is known as the Bretton Woods system was a pretty

07:27.040 --> 07:32.000
substantial departure from how things were before it and we'll be going into that in more depth later.

07:32.000 --> 07:37.600
The point here though is if things were going so well beforehand as Harris claims,

07:37.600 --> 07:41.360
it was modeled after the economic system that was working so well in the West.

07:41.360 --> 07:46.800
Then why would such substantial reforms have even been carried out? They wouldn't have been,

07:46.800 --> 07:52.400
obviously. This was just six years after the end of the Great Depression, the worst economic crisis

07:52.400 --> 07:58.640
in recorded history, which was immediately followed by World War II, the worst war in recorded history.

07:58.640 --> 08:04.000
So capitalism clearly wasn't actually working well at the time at all and that was precisely

08:04.000 --> 08:08.880
why these reforms were instituted. Harris is honestly often kind of difficult to respond to

08:08.880 --> 08:13.200
because he just makes statements like that which amounts a little more than things were good,

08:13.200 --> 08:18.560
so everyone agreed to do more good things. In reference to the fucking Great Depression,

08:18.560 --> 08:24.240
World War fucking II and the sweeping economic reforms that were carried out afterwards in

08:24.240 --> 08:29.280
an attempt to try and ensure that those things didn't happen again. It's genuinely childish.

08:29.280 --> 08:35.280
He presents history as if it has no context, no continuity, no nothing. To refute him,

08:35.280 --> 08:39.840
I had to go over the basics of what actually happened from scratch because his video just

08:39.840 --> 08:44.640
doesn't actually explain anything at all. And it's not like he's just getting some minor details

08:44.640 --> 08:49.120
wrong either. He's grossly mischaracterizing everything and leaving out so much crucial

08:49.120 --> 08:55.360
information that contradicts him that any response to his claims takes 5,000 times more effort than

08:55.440 --> 09:00.880
he put in to make them in the first place. Like he just blurts out that capitalism was working

09:00.880 --> 09:08.320
so well. That's a pretty bold statement to make about the world in 1945, given everything that

09:08.320 --> 09:13.280
had just happened in the decade or so prior. You'd think he'd at least expand on why he's saying

09:13.280 --> 09:18.640
that with some examples as to why and maybe even, I don't know, provide some proof to back it up,

09:18.640 --> 09:24.080
but Johnny Harris is above such pettiness. He just says stuff and then moves on. The audience

09:24.080 --> 09:29.920
is to just trust him. His videos are just a barrage of statement after statement, 90% of them

09:29.920 --> 09:35.600
backed up by nothing more than his undue confidence, maybe 10% of them actually being followed up with

09:35.600 --> 09:41.040
any attempt to explain the why and how of what he's saying, and even fewer than that backed up by

09:41.040 --> 09:46.160
anything even resembling a source. When he finally does get around to trying to present some evidence,

09:46.160 --> 09:51.440
it usually doesn't even actually back up what he's saying. And it sometimes even presents it as if

09:51.440 --> 09:56.720
it's some sort of special event. It's snappily edited and the music ramps up as if to say,

09:56.720 --> 10:02.400
look guys, I'm citing a source. I did it. You can trust me. He does exactly that in this video

10:02.400 --> 10:06.800
actually. After seven minutes of rapid fire statements with next to nothing presented to

10:06.800 --> 10:14.880
even try to back them up, this happens. I have two graphs I want to show you. They look like this.

10:15.280 --> 10:22.320
Wow. Great graphs he got there, dude. Excellent job. You finally presented a source. It's really

10:22.320 --> 10:28.560
propaganda theater. It's made to look and sound like it's insightful, informative, authoritative,

10:28.560 --> 10:33.440
and thus correct. But it falls apart immediately if you watch it while paying full attention and

10:33.440 --> 10:38.080
think about what's being said and what you're being shown. The video that we're covering here is an

10:38.080 --> 10:44.480
amazing example of all of this. It is the Johnny Harris video, par excellence. I speak good French,

10:44.480 --> 10:50.640
but it's also a paid propaganda video designed to dishonestly present the worst ideas from the

10:50.640 --> 10:55.520
world's most powerful and ghoulish capitalist and their corporations hatch for the purposes of

10:55.520 --> 11:00.480
maintaining their own power and wealth as if they're actually beneficial to the average person.

11:00.480 --> 11:05.200
Despite the title ostensibly being about China, it really has little to nothing to do with it.

11:05.200 --> 11:11.040
China is just used as a framing device to celebrate free markets, neoliberal capitalism,

11:11.040 --> 11:16.640
and then suggest more neoliberal capitalism as the solution to problems caused by neoliberal

11:16.640 --> 11:21.360
capitalism on behalf of the elites who have themselves benefited the most from neoliberal

11:21.360 --> 11:27.120
capitalism. Johnny Harris's videos already tend to be pretty childish propaganda, and in this one,

11:27.120 --> 11:32.080
where he's being paid by the World Economic Forum, he becomes a parody of himself.

11:32.080 --> 11:36.240
Something that Tom Nicholas didn't quite cover in his video is that Johnny Harris

11:36.240 --> 11:40.800
completely misrepresents the ideas that he's being paid to promote here, which are actually

11:40.800 --> 11:46.080
even worse than what they already seem like on the surface. He lied in order to paint a scheme

11:46.080 --> 11:51.920
crafted by billionaires to institute direct corporate rule over international governmental

11:51.920 --> 11:57.760
systems such as the UN as actually just little more than corporations being a bit nicer to their

11:57.760 --> 12:02.560
workers. And I'm well aware of the fact that that sounds like a conspiratorial exaggeration,

12:02.560 --> 12:07.440
but as I'm about to show you, it's really not. We're going to continue on here from the second

12:07.440 --> 12:12.320
half of the video, and then we're going to go back and dissect the rest of the first half afterwards.

12:12.320 --> 12:16.400
This is because it's only at the halfway point that he actually plays his hand

12:16.400 --> 12:20.720
and gets down to the real point of the video, which is to be propaganda for the World Economic

12:20.720 --> 12:26.240
Forum. So dissecting this bit is the most important thing to do here, and it's also very important

12:26.240 --> 12:30.480
context for the first half of the video too, because it's just so blatantly wrong about

12:30.480 --> 12:34.800
everything that it only really starts to make sense once you realize that the reason that it's

12:34.800 --> 12:40.960
like that is because the creator was being paid to lie. Part one, Johnny lies for the World Economic

12:40.960 --> 12:47.440
Forum. The World Economic Forum, which Johnny Harris very dishonestly presents as just a

12:47.440 --> 12:53.120
think tank, and I was able to partner with the World Economic Forum, which is a think tank that

12:53.120 --> 12:58.880
I respect, is the world's most powerful advocacy group for corporations and the ultra rich. On the

12:58.880 --> 13:04.480
one hand, it uses resources from its paid members, including pretty much every single one of the

13:04.480 --> 13:08.880
worst corporations that you can think of, to lobby governments and international organizations,

13:08.880 --> 13:14.240
such as the UN, to adopt policies that benefit them at the expense of everyone else. This is the part

13:14.240 --> 13:19.440
of the World Economic Forum, which is most insidious, and it often goes under the radar. So how convenient

13:19.440 --> 13:24.080
it is that in this video, by coincidence, we're going to be covering it. On the other hand,

13:24.080 --> 13:28.960
it and the events that it organizes, such as its yearly summit at Davos in Switzerland,

13:28.960 --> 13:34.560
act as a public relations exercise for its donors and members, as Tom Nicholas explained very well.

13:35.200 --> 13:39.680
Davos and the World Economic Forum then are essentially where the richest 1%

13:39.680 --> 13:44.480
go to pretend to have a conscience. While I'm sure there's plenty of backgroom

13:44.480 --> 13:49.280
wheeling and dealing which is facilitated by the World Economic Forum, in terms of its public

13:49.280 --> 13:55.840
facing activities, it serves as a means for global corporations and the super rich to repeatedly

13:55.840 --> 14:02.080
pretend to have seen the error of their ways and to be on the cusp of change before they go back to

14:02.080 --> 14:09.440
their boardrooms to carry on with business as usual. So Harris establishes the basis for his

14:09.440 --> 14:15.120
talking points taken directly from decades of World Economic Forum propaganda by making a couple

14:15.120 --> 14:21.840
of core claims. Firstly, he claims that the shift in economic policy in the West in the 70s and 80s

14:21.840 --> 14:28.240
towards neoliberalism made the West more prosperous. He makes this clear by continuously praising

14:28.240 --> 14:33.440
probably the most famous neoliberal ideologue of all time, Milton Friedman, and implying that the

14:33.440 --> 14:39.920
policies that he supported worked really well and that he had a point. Milton Friedman sort of had a point

14:42.000 --> 14:47.760
and it led to huge prosperity in the West as the US economy exploded.

14:48.480 --> 14:53.040
All of this is false and we're going to be refuting it in detail in part two of this video.

14:53.040 --> 14:58.560
Side note, if you're confused by me talking about neoliberalism here, then don't worry because I'm

14:58.560 --> 15:02.800
going to be explaining more about it as we get through the video. And I also have a whole video

15:02.800 --> 15:07.440
that explains it and its history in detail that you can check out. To be honest, you'd almost

15:07.440 --> 15:12.000
certainly learn way more that's actually useful by watching that video over this one, though it's

15:12.000 --> 15:16.320
also going to be considerably less entertaining than watching Johnny Harris get embarrassed.

15:16.320 --> 15:22.000
Pick your poison. The second core claim that Harris bases his conclusions on is the idea that

15:22.000 --> 15:27.920
the most important defining part of the modern economic era, again beginning in the 70s and 80s,

15:27.920 --> 15:33.920
is that corporations are now driven by a desire to make profits for their shareholders. So important

15:33.920 --> 15:39.120
and different this has supposedly been that it even merits being delineated as a completely

15:39.120 --> 15:46.160
different form of capitalism known as shareholder capitalism. The idea at the core of this financial

15:46.160 --> 15:52.560
and economic system was that companies would get investment from people who own shares in that

15:52.560 --> 15:58.080
company, we call this a corporation, and that the sole purpose of this corporation was to make

15:58.080 --> 16:03.840
money for these owners or these shareholders. Now this simply isn't true. The defining thing

16:03.840 --> 16:09.360
about this era was that neoliberalism inspired economic policies began to be implemented in

16:09.360 --> 16:14.800
practice in the 1970s and spread all over the world in a couple of decades. Not that there was some

16:14.800 --> 16:20.000
sort of massive paradigm shift where companies started seeking profit more than they had before.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.400
A shareholder is after all just someone who owns a part of a company, which might vary from a

16:24.400 --> 16:30.400
completely insignificant amount to a controlling stake. Corporations have obviously always been

16:30.400 --> 16:37.120
driven by seeking as much profit for their owners as possible. You can go back 110, 120 years or so

16:37.120 --> 16:43.040
to the era of standard oil for example, one of the most infamously horrible corporations in history

16:43.040 --> 16:47.920
and see that things were much the same. Companies seeking shareholder profit, which according to

16:47.920 --> 16:53.680
Harris is the most important defining part of the neoliberal era, is actually so unimportant to

16:53.680 --> 16:59.200
it that Friedman, the theorist who he cites approvingly throughout the video, didn't even mention

16:59.200 --> 17:05.120
that in his own definition of neoliberalism. He wrote, Neoliberalism would accept the 19th

17:05.120 --> 17:09.440
century liberal emphasis on the fundamental importance of the individual, but it would

17:09.440 --> 17:15.440
substitute for the 19th century goal of laissez-faire as a means to this end, the goal of the competitive

17:15.440 --> 17:21.120
order. It would seek to use competition among producers to protect consumers from exploitation,

17:21.120 --> 17:26.000
competition among employers to protect workers and owners of property, and competition among

17:26.000 --> 17:31.280
consumers to protect the enterprises themselves. The state would police the system, establish

17:31.280 --> 17:36.400
conditions favorable to competition and prevent monopoly, provide a stable monetary framework,

17:36.400 --> 17:41.200
and relieve acute misery and distress. The citizens would be protected against the state by the

17:41.200 --> 17:46.480
existence of a private free market, and against one another by the preservation of competition.

17:46.480 --> 17:52.080
So the actual crux of neoliberalism according to Friedman is that competition is everything,

17:52.080 --> 17:57.680
that the best society is a dog-eat-dog capitalist one, where everyone and everything is in a

17:57.680 --> 18:02.720
competition with one another at all times, with the spoils going to the winners and the losers

18:02.720 --> 18:07.600
getting as little as possible. Friedman says that the government should try to foster such a society

18:07.600 --> 18:12.880
and froze in some platitudes about this all supposedly being to protect people and a laughable

18:12.880 --> 18:17.840
bit about preventing monopoly. There's nothing about shareholders there, and that's because

18:17.840 --> 18:23.280
shareholder capitalism is just a buzzword that the World Economic Forum likes to use to divert

18:23.280 --> 18:28.480
attention away from neoliberal economic policies and blame the problems that they have caused on

18:28.480 --> 18:34.320
a complete red herring. Harris is just parroting them here, which is, you know, what you'd expect,

18:34.320 --> 18:39.760
given that they paid him to make this video. A good basic summary of what neoliberalism is in

18:39.760 --> 18:45.920
practice comes from the economic historian David Harvey. Neoliberalism is in the first instance

18:45.920 --> 18:51.760
a theory of political economic practices that proposes that human well-being can best be advanced

18:51.760 --> 18:57.120
by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework

18:57.120 --> 19:02.160
characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade. The role of the

19:02.160 --> 19:07.360
state is to create and preserve an institutional framework appropriate to such practices. The

19:07.360 --> 19:13.120
state has to guarantee, for example, the quality and integrity of money. It must also set up those

19:13.120 --> 19:19.360
military, defense, police, and legal structures and functions required to secure private property

19:19.360 --> 19:24.880
rights and to guarantee, by force if need be, the proper functioning of markets. Furthermore,

19:24.880 --> 19:31.920
if markets do not exist in areas such as land, water, education, healthcare, social security,

19:31.920 --> 19:37.600
or environmental pollution, then they must be created by state action if necessary. But beyond

19:37.600 --> 19:42.960
these tasks, the state should not venture. State interventions in markets, once created,

19:42.960 --> 19:48.720
must be kept to a bare minimum. There has everywhere been an emphatic turn towards neoliberalism

19:48.720 --> 19:55.440
in political economic practices and thinking since the 1970s. Deregulation, privatization,

19:55.440 --> 20:00.800
and withdrawal of the state from many areas of social provision have become all too common.

20:00.800 --> 20:06.560
Almost all states, from those newly minted after the collapse of the Soviet Union to old-style

20:06.560 --> 20:11.200
social democracies in welfare states such as New Zealand and Sweden, have embraced,

20:11.200 --> 20:16.480
sometimes voluntarily and in other instances in response to coercive pressures, some version

20:16.480 --> 20:22.240
of neoliberal theory, and adjusted at least some policies and practices accordingly. That's all

20:22.240 --> 20:28.320
exactly the sort of thinking and exactly the sort of economic policies that the World Economic Forum

20:28.320 --> 20:33.280
advocates for and that its corporate members benefit from. So they pretty clearly aren't

20:33.280 --> 20:39.120
actually against the fundamentals of the economics of this period. So what they instead do is try

20:39.120 --> 20:44.720
and convince people that the economic problems of the last 40 to 50 years haven't actually been

20:44.720 --> 20:50.800
caused by these policies or by flaws in capitalism itself, but rather just by corporations making

20:50.800 --> 20:55.920
a mistake and seeking too much profit. Which apparently wasn't a problem before this,

20:55.920 --> 21:01.360
because if we believe this, then they can sell us the idea that the way to fix this problem isn't

21:01.360 --> 21:06.560
actually by governments taking meaningful action to rein these corporations in, or any change at all

21:06.560 --> 21:11.840
to the economic system itself, but rather by just leaving it to corporations to change how they

21:11.840 --> 21:16.960
govern themselves. Just trusting them to voluntarily stop being driven by profit,

21:16.960 --> 21:22.560
become socially responsible in other such buzzwords and fix it all themselves. Surely

21:22.560 --> 21:28.160
that being honest here, that'll definitely work. This is how the WEF tends to conduct a lot of its

21:28.160 --> 21:33.520
public relations exercises. They acknowledge the issues caused by pro-corporate policies,

21:33.520 --> 21:38.240
such as massive inequality and climate change, because it's kind of impossible for them to ignore

21:38.240 --> 21:43.600
them at this point. But they frame these problems as being caused by things other than their actual

21:43.600 --> 21:48.880
causes, because if we accept their alternate explanation, they can then lead us to the conclusion

21:48.880 --> 21:54.080
that the overall direction of economic policy should remain fundamentally the same as it has

21:54.080 --> 21:59.840
since the 70s and 80s, which is, you know, exactly what they want. It's simple diversion.

21:59.840 --> 22:04.640
So, once Harris has finally stopped lying to the viewer about the cause of those problems in the

22:04.640 --> 22:11.280
exact same way the World Economic Forum does, he, shocker, proposes the exact solution they do.

22:11.280 --> 22:16.640
But of course, he first takes a second to just offhandedly scoff at the idea that socialism

22:16.640 --> 22:22.160
might be an alternative solution. In true Johnny Harris fashion, no reasoning or explanation for

22:22.160 --> 22:30.080
this is given. So, what's the solution? Is it socialism? No, it's not. It is simply a new

22:30.080 --> 22:35.520
version of capitalism, a reframing of how we think about business and globalization.

22:35.520 --> 22:41.440
No, he says with utmost confidence. The real solution is to move on to another form of capitalism

22:41.440 --> 22:47.600
from this non-existent shareholder one. What we need to do is just change the way we think about

22:47.600 --> 22:52.640
business and globalization. He's not actually calling for any action in that buzzword salad,

22:52.640 --> 22:57.440
just a change in thinking, which is reflected in the solution that he's about to propose,

22:57.440 --> 23:02.320
doing the same stuff, but reframing it as somehow actually beneficial for workers.

23:02.320 --> 23:07.840
The mythology of neoliberalism supposedly being good for normal people can no longer be upheld

23:07.920 --> 23:12.560
since the last 50 years of its practice have shown us clearly that that's not true. So,

23:12.560 --> 23:18.240
it needs a rebranding. And here it is. The solution isn't to scrap capitalism altogether,

23:18.240 --> 23:24.080
but instead to expand it, to not just focus on shareholders and delivering them short-term

23:24.080 --> 23:29.120
profits as quickly and as efficiently as possible, but to also focus on other people

23:29.120 --> 23:35.760
who are affected by the business. You can call these stakeholders. This is like the customers

23:35.760 --> 23:41.520
and the suppliers and the employees and the government and the overall economy and the planet

23:41.520 --> 23:46.400
and, of course, shareholders. This is called stakeholder capitalism. And it's basically

23:46.400 --> 23:51.440
just an acknowledgement that businesses that focus only on profits for shareholders don't

23:51.440 --> 23:56.960
end up benefiting everyone. There are winners and losers. So, the solution to the problems

23:56.960 --> 24:04.320
of corporations being motivated by self-interest is for corporations to magically just no longer

24:04.320 --> 24:10.240
be motivated by self-interest and to start just miraculously renouncing the profit motive,

24:10.240 --> 24:14.800
getting themselves a conscience, and voluntarily helping everyone out of the goodness of their

24:14.800 --> 24:18.880
hearts, which they don't have because they're corporations. There's not any sort of actual

24:18.880 --> 24:24.560
call to action to make this happen. No government intervention, no regulations, no nothing. It's

24:24.560 --> 24:30.080
just something that we need to trust corporations to do themselves. Yeah. Obviously, this isn't

24:30.080 --> 24:34.640
going to happen. Corporations are not just going to regulate themselves out of a sense of social

24:34.640 --> 24:38.800
obligation. They're not just going to give up their wealth and power because they feel bad about

24:38.800 --> 24:44.480
having it. On the occasions that they do actually concede things to other so-called stakeholders,

24:44.480 --> 24:51.040
it is overwhelmingly because they're forced to do so by government action. And on the very rare

24:51.040 --> 24:56.160
occasions where it might seem like they're taking such actions themselves, it's certainly not out

24:56.160 --> 25:01.280
of a sense of obligation to other stakeholders. It's just because they've calculated that doing

25:01.280 --> 25:07.360
so won't damage or will increase their profits in other ways. For example, by giving them good

25:07.360 --> 25:13.280
publicity, by increasing worker productivity, or by keeping workers just happy enough that they're

25:13.280 --> 25:18.560
less likely to start advocating for something that might end up costing the company more. A good

25:18.560 --> 25:24.000
example of this is Amazon instituting a minimum wage of $15 an hour for American employees.

25:24.000 --> 25:28.320
It helps to make them look like they care about their workers, while at the same time,

25:28.320 --> 25:33.360
they do everything possible to bust their workers' efforts at unionization to prevent them from

25:33.360 --> 25:38.320
actually being able to exert collective pressure on the company and advocate for their own interests

25:38.320 --> 25:43.760
on their own terms. It's not about the company legitimately caring about its stakeholders or

25:43.760 --> 25:48.640
anything even remotely like that. It's about unaccountable executives deciding to give them

25:48.640 --> 25:53.200
a little bit in the hopes that they don't start demanding something more substantial that would

25:53.200 --> 25:58.960
lower their profits more. And Amazon, completely coincidentally I'm sure, just so happens to be

25:58.960 --> 26:04.800
one of the World Economic Forum's strategic partners. Tom Nicholas summed up the essence of all of this

26:04.800 --> 26:10.160
very well. The World Economic Forum's decision to work with Johnny Harris to create a video about

26:10.160 --> 26:16.400
how companies such as Apple and Walmart are currently enthusiastically moving away from

26:16.400 --> 26:22.480
shareholder capitalism and towards this vague notion of stakeholder capitalism is just another

26:22.480 --> 26:29.440
in a long line of examples of the forum attempting to convince us that against all the evidence

26:29.440 --> 26:35.040
they are even remotely concerned about anything other than profit. With everything that we've

26:35.040 --> 26:40.640
just been over in mind, I want to present you with a quote from this book, Stakeholder Capitalism,

26:40.640 --> 26:45.840
which is the book that the World Economic Forum paid Johnny Harris to make this video to promote.

26:45.840 --> 26:51.360
The head of the World Economic Forum just launched a book called literally Stakeholder Capitalism.

26:51.360 --> 26:56.560
It's an in-depth look at not only the rise of Asia and China, but also other major trends that

26:56.560 --> 27:01.040
help us understand the need to upgrade our capitalism. Klaus Schwab, the founder of the

27:01.040 --> 27:07.600
World Economic Forum, writes within it, I therefore advocate for a third system which can be defined

27:07.600 --> 27:12.320
as stakeholder capitalism. It is capitalism in the traditional definition of the word.

27:12.320 --> 27:17.920
Individuals and private companies make up the largest share of the economy. This is, I believe,

27:18.000 --> 27:23.200
a requirement for a sustainable economic system. Private individuals and companies must be able

27:23.200 --> 27:28.800
to innovate and compete freely, as it unleashes the creative energy and work ethic of most people

27:28.800 --> 27:34.480
in society. The economic activities of such private actors must also be protected and guided,

27:34.480 --> 27:39.120
to ensure the overall direction of economic development is beneficial to society,

27:39.120 --> 27:44.560
and no actor can free ride on the efforts of others. This is the kind of capitalism we ought to

27:44.560 --> 27:48.960
endorse. Do you notice how that sounds oddly similar to Milton Friedman's description of

27:48.960 --> 27:53.920
neoliberalism that we went over earlier? That's because it is just the same thing. The whole

27:53.920 --> 27:59.680
notion of stakeholder capitalism, as presented in this video by Johnny Harris, and as obsessed about

27:59.680 --> 28:06.160
by the World Economic Forum, is just a rebranding of neoliberalism. Harris and the WEF erased the

28:06.160 --> 28:12.000
existence of neoliberalism entirely, creating this phantom of shareholder capitalism to shoulder

28:12.000 --> 28:16.720
the blame for its problems and act as a sort of non-existent scapegoat, in order to propose a

28:16.720 --> 28:22.080
solution that they frame as literally an entirely different version of capitalism, which even the

28:22.080 --> 28:28.880
slightest scrutiny reveals is still just neoliberalism, with some vague, PR speak buzzwords thrown in

28:28.880 --> 28:34.480
to try and make it sound like it's somehow different. It's not. As political scientist Kyle

28:34.480 --> 28:40.720
Bailey wrote, now that the myth of free markets can no longer convincingly naturalize the public

28:40.800 --> 28:46.880
role of states, in imposing actually existing neoliberalism, the discourse of stakeholder

28:46.880 --> 28:53.440
capitalism represents its continuation by other means. Despite pretensions to move beyond profit

28:53.440 --> 28:59.600
maximization, corporations' attempts to satisfy extra economic interests remain firmly grounded

28:59.600 --> 29:05.040
in the same capitalist market imperatives that proponents of stakeholder capitalism now claim

29:05.120 --> 29:10.800
to be addressing. Here's an even worse thing though. Harris isn't even actually being honest

29:10.800 --> 29:15.840
about what's stakeholder capitalism, as promoted by the World Economic Forum in the book that he's

29:15.840 --> 29:20.880
trying to sell to his viewers here, actually is. His presentation are that he's already incredibly

29:20.880 --> 29:27.360
misleading, dishonest, and really just full of lies, but he also left out the more unsavory and

29:27.360 --> 29:32.560
much more serious parts about what this term means to the World Economic Forum. You see,

29:32.560 --> 29:38.320
they don't just think that companies should take their stakeholders into account or whatever.

29:38.320 --> 29:45.760
For them, this notion of stakeholderism extends to everything, including national and international

29:45.760 --> 29:53.440
governance. They consider multinational corporations to be stakeholders of the world itself, who

29:53.440 --> 29:59.200
should have much bigger and much more direct seats at the table when it comes to political

29:59.200 --> 30:04.640
decision making. The BS about corporations saving the world out of the goodness of their hearts

30:04.640 --> 30:10.000
by deciding to treat workers slightly better rather than seeking profits is cover for their

30:10.000 --> 30:16.480
ultimate idea of giving corporations even more political power than what they already have.

30:16.480 --> 30:22.320
This is articulated in the book itself. A company that has a multinational scope of activities

30:22.320 --> 30:28.880
not only serves all those stakeholders who are directly engaged, but acts itself as a stakeholder

30:28.960 --> 30:35.680
together with governments and civil society of our global future. So, according to the very book

30:35.680 --> 30:41.200
that Harris was paid to promote, multinational corporations need to be stakeholders on the

30:41.200 --> 30:47.120
national and international stage, on the same level as national governments and civil society

30:47.120 --> 30:53.440
organizations, the latter meaning things like NGOs, which are themselves overwhelmingly founded

30:53.440 --> 30:59.600
and or funded by those same multinational corporations and so advocate for their interests

30:59.600 --> 31:05.200
as well anyway. This is what the stakeholder capitalism buzzword is actually about for them,

31:05.200 --> 31:11.200
giving corporations even more direct decision making power regarding the direction of global

31:11.200 --> 31:16.880
politics on top of all of the incredibly pervasive and destructive ways in which they already

31:16.880 --> 31:23.120
influence global politics. They hide this goal of wanting to make themselves even more powerful

31:23.200 --> 31:28.960
stakeholders in international governance behind this notion that all they want to do is make you

31:28.960 --> 31:35.760
a stakeholder of the company that you work for. The economist Jens Martens summarized the WEF's

31:35.760 --> 31:42.240
overall agenda. The World Economic Forum postulates that a globalized world is best managed by a

31:42.240 --> 31:48.560
coalition of multinational corporations, governments, including through the UN system, and select civil

31:49.120 --> 31:54.320
society organizations. It argues that governments no longer are the overwhelmingly dominant actors

31:54.320 --> 32:00.000
on the world stage and that the time has come for a new stakeholder paradigm of international

32:00.000 --> 32:06.000
governance. The World Economic Forum vision includes a public private UN in which certain

32:06.000 --> 32:12.000
specialized agencies would operate under joint state and non-state governance systems such as with

32:12.000 --> 32:17.440
the Food and Agriculture Organization through a global food agriculture and nutrition redesign

32:17.440 --> 32:23.040
initiative. This model also assumes that some issues would be taken off the agenda of the UN

32:23.040 --> 32:29.280
system to be addressed by pluralateral, often multi-stakeholder, coalitions of the willing and

32:29.280 --> 32:35.760
able. What the World Economic Forum is advocating for with this red herring of stakeholder capitalism

32:35.760 --> 32:40.000
is not the solution to the problems of neoliberalism that Harris presents it as,

32:40.000 --> 32:46.560
nor is it meant to be. It is rather the final form of neoliberalism, the fundamental neoliberal

32:46.560 --> 32:52.960
notion of total and complete competition is taken to the ultimate extreme, corporations competing

32:52.960 --> 32:57.840
with governments for the power to govern in a much more direct way than they have before.

32:57.840 --> 33:03.760
And it's even worse with a bit more added context. Klaus Schwab, founder and chairman of the WEF,

33:03.760 --> 33:08.000
whose name is on the cover of the book, though you know it was almost certainly ghost written,

33:08.000 --> 33:13.440
has said that he considers nation states to be obsolete and that they should be replaced with

33:13.440 --> 33:18.560
a global issue alliance, which based on their other statements would probably be made up of

33:18.560 --> 33:24.560
multinational corporations. In context with everything else, it really makes it seem like their

33:24.560 --> 33:30.480
ultimate goal is not just the already incredibly worrying idea of taking substantial decision

33:30.480 --> 33:35.840
making power away from states and handing it directly to multinational corporations,

33:35.840 --> 33:42.000
but rather to get rid of governments entirely and create some sort of anarcho-capitalist cyberpunk

33:42.000 --> 33:47.440
dystopia, where corporations just plain control everything. Now I don't want to fear Monger too

33:47.440 --> 33:52.800
much about the WEF's agenda here, while they have laid it all out pretty clearly and pretty

33:52.800 --> 33:57.120
explicitly, that doesn't mean that they've gotten their way or that they will. There is no

33:57.120 --> 34:02.240
world economic forum led, new world order government on the way or anything, which conspiracy

34:02.240 --> 34:06.800
theorists often claim. Though given the kind of stuff that the world economic forum advocates

34:06.800 --> 34:12.640
for that we just went over, I can really understand how such conspiracy theories come to be.

34:12.640 --> 34:17.200
The WEF is just an advocacy group for corporations that ask the question of,

34:17.200 --> 34:22.240
how can corporations get even more power? And they came to the quite rational conclusion from

34:22.240 --> 34:27.680
their perspective of, they should try to seize more direct decision making power from governments

34:27.680 --> 34:32.320
themselves. This is completely predictable and expected, which is precisely why corporate

34:32.320 --> 34:38.000
governed dystopias were already being presented in fiction, long before the WEF proposed such

34:38.000 --> 34:43.600
ideas themselves. It's simply the logic of capitalism being taken to its ultimate conclusion.

34:43.600 --> 34:49.840
But these goals also aren't zero sum. It's not either they establish the literal anarcho-capitalist

34:49.840 --> 34:55.760
cyberpunk dystopia or their failed. They just want as much direct influence over decision making as

34:55.760 --> 35:00.400
they can get, and they've actually already been making inroads on this for quite a while now.

35:00.400 --> 35:05.840
In the UN for example, the influence of their rhetoric can clearly be seen. Buzzwords for

35:05.840 --> 35:12.080
pervasive corporate involvement, like multi-stakeholderism and public-private partnerships,

35:12.080 --> 35:17.760
have become more and more common in UN documents. And multinationals have an even more prominent

35:17.760 --> 35:22.880
and direct role in the UN and other global initiatives than they've ever had before.

35:22.880 --> 35:29.040
In 2019, the World Economic Forum even signed a strategic partnership agreement with the UN.

35:29.040 --> 35:34.720
This is extremely bad, not just because more corporate power and influence is bad in general,

35:34.720 --> 35:40.160
but also because it's even more undemocratic than things already were before. While average people

35:40.160 --> 35:44.800
may be able to exert at least a tiny little bit of influence over their governments through things

35:44.800 --> 35:50.320
like voting and protests for example, they have nothing even resembling that minor little bit of

35:50.320 --> 35:55.440
influence when it comes to corporations. So with every little bit of decision making ability that

35:55.440 --> 36:01.680
corporations wrestle away from states, nationally or internationally, you and people like you lose

36:01.680 --> 36:06.880
more of whatever little decision making power you've got left. It's being appropriated from you

36:06.880 --> 36:12.320
and being handed over to capitalists and executives directly. In order to even think about fighting

36:12.320 --> 36:16.640
these sorts of initiatives, we first need to actually know that they're going on. And now you

36:16.640 --> 36:22.560
do, despite the fact that Johnny Harris kind of forgot to inform you of that in his video. Harris

36:22.560 --> 36:27.040
outright stated that he read the book and thought that it was great. The book is really good. Yet

36:27.040 --> 36:32.160
he nonetheless decided to leave out the whole, corporations should be stakeholders in global

36:32.160 --> 36:38.080
governance and get their own seats at the UN thing. He's even proudly gloated that he was personally

36:38.080 --> 36:45.760
involved in that year's WEF summit at Davos. The Davos summit happened this week and I'm really

36:45.760 --> 36:50.960
glad that I was able to be a part of it. So he's clearly familiar with the organization and he

36:50.960 --> 36:55.520
should be familiar with their broader agendas too. They're outlined in the book that he supposedly

36:55.520 --> 37:01.120
read. The book that he promotes in this video. His video is already garbage immoral propaganda,

37:01.120 --> 37:08.240
but with this extra context, it is even worse. He lied knowingly in exchange for money. It's

37:08.240 --> 37:13.680
that simple. And we haven't even covered the rest of the video yet where he lies a whole lot more.

37:14.320 --> 37:16.240
Part 2. The Debunking

37:18.080 --> 37:22.240
Now with the most important part out of the way, it's time to go back to the first half of the

37:22.240 --> 37:28.080
video and refute the historical narrative of neoliberalism bringing amazing prosperity and

37:28.080 --> 37:33.360
the claims that Harris makes to craft it, which is the foundation that he uses to propose the

37:33.360 --> 37:39.200
ideas that we just dissected. How the video has a title about China, I just don't know. It's

37:39.200 --> 37:44.560
mentioned in the intro, promptly forgotten about for a while, and then glossed over for a minute or

37:44.560 --> 37:50.320
two later. It's actually a video about how great free market capitalism supposedly is, and China

37:50.320 --> 37:56.000
is just used as a framing device for that to pull the viewer in to what is actually a paid propaganda

37:56.000 --> 38:00.560
video. This part is going to be quite long and detailed, partly because the effort that you have

38:00.560 --> 38:05.600
to put in to debunk misinformation is incredibly high relative to the effort that it takes to make

38:05.600 --> 38:11.840
it up, and partly because that's just how my videos are. I like to be thorough. So let's recap

38:11.840 --> 38:17.200
and expand upon what we went over at the beginning. The video starts off with this zero context

38:17.200 --> 38:22.800
presentation of the industrial revolution as some sort of miracle that just magically popped up out

38:22.800 --> 38:29.360
of nowhere. Inverting reality to make it sound like it was the industrial revolution that birthed

38:29.360 --> 38:34.720
western colonialism rather than the other way around. And capitalism doesn't sound quite as

38:34.720 --> 38:41.200
good if you actually include the fact that what Harris frames as the West's amazing success was

38:41.200 --> 38:46.240
built on the subjugation of billions of people. It's important to emphasize that the development

38:46.240 --> 38:52.000
of the industrial revolution was hardly some sort of miracle of free market capitalism, as is often

38:52.000 --> 38:57.920
taken for granted, including by Harris here. It happened under the circumstances of pervasive

38:57.920 --> 39:03.440
government protection of local industry, combined with the aggressive destruction of competitors

39:03.440 --> 39:09.600
abroad, and the importation of resources and capital to be invested from the Americas. The best

39:09.600 --> 39:14.960
example of this is the development of the British textiles industry, the first truly fully mechanized

39:14.960 --> 39:20.080
industry in the world, and the most emblematic development of the first industrial revolution.

39:20.080 --> 39:25.600
This industry was not only supplied by slave farmed cotton from the Americas, but was also

39:25.600 --> 39:30.800
fostered by the government, who put restrictive tariffs on textile imports from India, which at

39:30.800 --> 39:36.160
the time had the most important textile export sector in the world. This encouraged investment

39:36.160 --> 39:42.160
in the local textile industry to replace these imports. This is commonly known as import substitution

39:42.160 --> 39:47.520
industrialization. All of this happened while the British were also simultaneously colonizing

39:47.520 --> 39:53.040
India and directly destroying the Indian textile industry. The result was that the British textile

39:53.040 --> 39:58.480
industry became the world's most important, even exporting its products to India itself.

39:58.480 --> 40:04.320
So the industrial revolution was built off the back of colonialism and spurred by very

40:04.320 --> 40:08.960
anti-free market government interference, contrary to pretty much everything about

40:08.960 --> 40:14.000
Harris's narrative throughout this video. Most developed countries today in fact industrialize

40:14.000 --> 40:19.440
with these sorts of policies, protectionism, import substitution, etc, and they only started

40:19.440 --> 40:25.120
with this rhetoric of free international trade once their own industry was developed enough as

40:25.120 --> 40:32.000
a result to out-compete that of other countries. So anyway, moving on. As we went over earlier,

40:32.000 --> 40:39.440
Harris then finally introduces capitalism in 1945, about 200 or 300 years depending on who you ask,

40:39.440 --> 40:44.080
after the time that it actually developed, conveniently skipping over all of the absolutely

40:44.080 --> 40:49.200
horrible things about it during that period. He then moves on to inverting reality again,

40:49.200 --> 40:55.360
claiming that capitalism was working so well while simultaneously introducing the post-World

40:55.360 --> 41:01.200
War II Bretton Woods Accords. Bretton Woods was an agreement between mostly western states that

41:01.200 --> 41:06.880
govern the rules of international trade between them for about 30 years afterwards. This was

41:06.880 --> 41:11.920
specifically implemented because capitalism actually wasn't working very well and had just

41:11.920 --> 41:16.800
been through its worst ever crisis, the Great Depression, and you know the whole World War II

41:16.800 --> 41:22.480
thing too. The Bretton Woods era was characterized by fixed currency exchange rates for international

41:22.480 --> 41:26.800
trade which were backed by the gold standard, tightened government regulations on business,

41:26.800 --> 41:32.320
strong welfare states, and so-called mixed economies involving both private and public

41:32.320 --> 41:38.080
sector ownership. Academically, this is often known as the period of embedded liberalism.

41:38.080 --> 41:43.040
The embedded part comes from the work of the economic theorist Carl Polanyi who used the

41:43.040 --> 41:49.760
word to emphasize the controls put on markets by outside factors such as the government as opposed

41:49.760 --> 41:55.360
to disembedded, which describes a more free market that is not subject to such controls.

41:55.360 --> 42:00.320
David Harvey summarized the causes and characteristics of the period of embedded

42:00.320 --> 42:06.080
liberalism in the West. The restructuring of state forms and of international relations

42:06.080 --> 42:11.120
after the Second World War was designed to prevent a return to the catastrophic conditions

42:11.120 --> 42:16.080
that had so threatened the capitalist order in the great slump of the 1930s. It was also

42:16.080 --> 42:20.960
supposed to prevent the reemergence of interstate geopolitical rivalries that had led to the war.

42:20.960 --> 42:26.240
To ensure domestic peace and tranquility, some sort of class compromise between capital and

42:26.240 --> 42:31.520
labor had to be constructed. The thinking at the time is perhaps best represented by an influential

42:31.520 --> 42:37.760
text by two eminent social scientists, Robert Dahl and Charles Limblum, published in 1953.

42:37.760 --> 42:43.360
Both capitalism and communism in their raw forms had failed, they argued. The only way ahead was to

42:43.360 --> 42:49.760
construct the right blend of state, market, and democratic institutions to guarantee peace, inclusion,

42:49.760 --> 42:55.040
well-being, and stability. And so a variety of social democratic, Christian democratic,

42:55.040 --> 43:00.560
and dyrihista states emerged in Europe after the Second World War. The US itself turned

43:00.560 --> 43:06.000
towards a liberal democratic state form, and Japan, under the close supervision of the US,

43:06.000 --> 43:10.240
built a nominally democratic but impracticed highly bureaucratic state apparatus,

43:10.240 --> 43:14.960
empowered to oversee the reconstruction of that country. What all of these various state forms

43:14.960 --> 43:20.800
had in common was an acceptance that the state should focus on full employment, economic growth,

43:20.800 --> 43:26.320
and the welfare of its citizens, and that state power should be freely deployed alongside, or if

43:26.320 --> 43:32.080
necessary, intervening in or even substituting for market processes to achieve these ends.

43:32.080 --> 43:37.840
Fiscal and monetary policies, usually dubbed Keynesian, were widely deployed to dampen business

43:37.840 --> 43:43.840
cycles and to ensure reasonably full employment. A class compromise between capital and labor

43:43.840 --> 43:49.760
was generally advocated as a key guarantor of domestic peace and tranquility. States actively

43:49.760 --> 43:55.200
intervened in industrial policy and moved to set standards for the social wage by constructing

43:55.200 --> 44:00.720
a variety of welfare systems, healthcare, education, and the like. This form of political

44:01.280 --> 44:06.640
organization is now usually referred to as embedded liberalism, to signal how market

44:06.640 --> 44:11.680
processes and entrepreneurial and corporate activities were surrounded by a web of social

44:11.680 --> 44:16.720
and political constraints and a regulatory environment that sometimes restrained but in

44:16.720 --> 44:22.240
other instances led the way in economic and industrial strategy. State-led planning and in

44:22.240 --> 44:28.880
some instances, state ownership of key sectors, coal, steel, automobiles, were not uncommon. For

44:28.880 --> 44:34.400
example, in Britain, France, and Italy. The neoliberal project is to disembed capital

44:34.400 --> 44:40.720
from these constraints. So yeah, not exactly the sort of thing that Harris is advocating for in

44:40.720 --> 44:45.520
this video. Harris glosses over the amount of government intervention that actually characterized

44:45.520 --> 44:51.280
this era, acknowledging only that it involved government oversight and higher taxes and regulation,

44:51.280 --> 44:56.800
but nonetheless framing it as largely the same as before. A continuation of something that was

44:56.800 --> 45:03.200
working so well, which is a very audacious thing to say about the period immediately following

45:03.200 --> 45:09.520
the Great Depression and World War II. He then credits a vague notion of capitalism with rebuilding

45:09.520 --> 45:14.320
Europe after the war, as if it was just the wonders of the free market that did it or something.

45:14.320 --> 45:19.760
Seriously, he talks about this in the same way that a missionary would tell you about the miracles

45:19.760 --> 45:25.680
of Jesus Christ. Capitalism, free enterprise, still with some government oversight and high

45:25.760 --> 45:30.240
taxes for the rich and corporations, but it was still capitalism. And after the war,

45:30.240 --> 45:36.800
this capitalism would go on to become a miracle for many countries. Rebuilding Germany, France,

45:36.800 --> 45:43.440
Japan. For many in the West, post-World War II capitalism was like a magic elixir that was fixing

45:43.440 --> 45:50.720
everything. He verbatim calls it a magic elixir that was fixing everything. At least try to be

45:50.720 --> 45:57.440
subtle, come on. His core claim in that segment is that capitalism caused a miracle that rebuilt

45:57.440 --> 46:02.960
Europe after World War II, implying that what happened was some sort of miracle of the free market.

46:02.960 --> 46:07.520
That couldn't be further from the truth. What happened after the war is that much of Europe

46:07.520 --> 46:14.800
was destroyed while the USA, due to its geographic position, came out not just unscathed, but with

46:14.800 --> 46:21.120
a booming economy. So Western European countries, along with others such as Japan and South Korea,

46:21.120 --> 46:26.880
were absolutely desperate to rebuild. And the USA was the only game in town, since they obviously

46:26.880 --> 46:32.800
wouldn't have let them seek help from the USSR, even if they wanted to. The US used this monopoly to

46:32.800 --> 46:38.240
create the Marshall Plan and other adjacent initiatives, which gave aid to those countries.

46:38.240 --> 46:44.080
The catch was that this money could only be used to buy resources, such as food and building

46:44.080 --> 46:50.720
materials, from sources that the USA had chosen, which usually meant from the USA itself. This not

46:50.720 --> 46:56.160
only meant that the money from the aid was just flowing right back to the USA anyway, but it also

46:56.160 --> 47:02.560
allowed its exports to penetrate into Europe in a much more long-lasting fashion. All of this was

47:02.560 --> 47:09.440
imposed by the USA on countries that were in no position to refuse. So it was an initiative conceived

47:09.440 --> 47:15.280
by the US government, directed by them every step of the way, to give their country a functional

47:15.280 --> 47:21.680
monopoly over post-war trade and ensure their influence over the aid recipients. That is how

47:21.680 --> 47:27.840
these countries were actually rebuilt after World War II, not by the wonders of free market forces,

47:27.840 --> 47:34.720
but by pervasive and often coercive state action. But Johnny Harris frames it as some sort of magical

47:34.720 --> 47:41.360
free market explosion, where the magic words of capitalism and free market just caused miracles

47:41.360 --> 47:46.480
to happen. But again, the reason that Harris can't be honest about this and just glosses over it so

47:46.480 --> 47:52.240
childishly is because the thesis of this part of the video is just that free market capitalism is

47:52.240 --> 47:58.000
super awesome, because that's what the World Economic Forum mandated conclusion needs it to be.

47:58.000 --> 48:03.440
So if you acknowledge the fact that the post-World War II rebuilding of Europe was carried out under

48:03.440 --> 48:08.880
just about the fervorce thing from the principles of free market capitalism imaginable, his entire

48:08.880 --> 48:14.560
narrative would crumble. Harris then makes this statement. It was working so well that more and

48:14.560 --> 48:19.360
more people started to believe that we needed to get government out of capitalism and let the market

48:19.360 --> 48:24.720
just do its thing. This is another claim that's just contradicted by his own narrative. Everything

48:24.720 --> 48:30.800
was just working so well after the war with embedded liberalism that this drove people to

48:30.800 --> 48:36.960
want to change things by completely abandoning everything that had characterized that system

48:36.960 --> 48:43.360
and all of its magical miracles, where only two minutes in and Harris has said something stupid,

48:43.360 --> 48:49.200
nonsensical or contradicted himself just about every other sentence. Anyway, so this just isn't

48:49.200 --> 48:55.920
true. Normal people, one suddenly like, ah man, this sucks. I hate being guaranteed a decent wage.

48:55.920 --> 49:01.040
I hate having public health care and social welfare. I hate that corporations can't just do

49:01.040 --> 49:05.360
whatever they want and that I actually have some bargaining power so they have to at least give

49:05.360 --> 49:11.600
people like me some concessions. You know what I want? I want all of that gone. Now, the people

49:11.600 --> 49:17.840
that were advocating for this were businessmen, executives, and their paid propagandists,

49:17.840 --> 49:24.880
Johnny Harris's forebears, like Milton Friedman, the one singular person who he actually presents

49:24.880 --> 49:31.760
as evidence for his idea of people wanting to just let the market do its thing. One of the major

49:31.760 --> 49:38.160
advocates for this idea of unfettered capitalism was this guy. There has never in history been a

49:38.160 --> 49:42.640
more effective machine for eliminating poverty than the free enterprise system in the free market.

49:42.640 --> 49:49.600
A Chicago-based economist named Milton Friedman. If they fail, they bear the cost. If they succeed,

49:50.400 --> 49:54.880
they get the benefit. This turn towards letting the market do its thing,

49:54.880 --> 50:01.520
as Harris describes it, began in the early 1970s. It's called, as we went over earlier,

50:01.520 --> 50:08.400
neoliberalism, not shareholder capitalism. And its conception actually long predates the time frame

50:08.400 --> 50:13.760
that Harris seems to ascribe to it. It's public advocates who had been paid to push it from the

50:13.760 --> 50:20.160
mid-1940s onwards by the ultra-rich via think tanks such as the Mont Pelerin Society and the

50:20.160 --> 50:26.560
Institute of Economic Affairs had long been lobbying for a turn to neoliberalism. This advocacy was,

50:26.560 --> 50:31.440
from the very beginning, in opposition to embedded liberalism and bread and woods,

50:31.440 --> 50:36.400
because capitalists considered this system to be too restrictive on their interests. Not,

50:36.400 --> 50:42.800
as Harris claims, the post-war period being super awesome, causing people in general to,

50:42.800 --> 50:49.120
for some reason, just incomprehensibly decide to get rid of everything that had characterized it

50:49.120 --> 50:55.120
and replace it with something else. The actual reasons behind this turn to neoliberalism are a

50:55.120 --> 51:01.360
lot less savory than that. Embedded liberalism began to run into problems in the early 1970s,

51:01.360 --> 51:07.840
and the 1973 oil crisis was the definitive nail in its coffin. Numerous prominent scholars on the

51:07.920 --> 51:14.160
subject like David Harvey, Gerard Domeniel and Dominique Levy have concluded that the upper classes

51:14.160 --> 51:19.440
took advantage of this chaotic situation to push for the replacement of embedded liberalism with

51:19.440 --> 51:25.440
neoliberalism. Up until this point, neoliberalism had been little more than a fringe economic

51:25.440 --> 51:31.520
theory pushed by their think tanks and a couple of board and paid for university economics departments

51:31.520 --> 51:36.800
like Friedman's University of Chicago. But now they had a chance to make it reality,

51:36.800 --> 51:42.320
to rapidly put it into practice. The post-war system had greatly reduced their economic power

51:42.320 --> 51:47.920
from its pre-war levels, and they wanted it back. Neoliberalism in practice was first

51:47.920 --> 51:53.760
implemented via imperialism. The USA backed a bloody military coup in Chile, where an elected

51:53.760 --> 51:59.040
socialist government was overthrown via military coup and replaced with a neoliberal military

51:59.040 --> 52:05.280
dictatorship. Economists trained at the aforementioned corporate funded Chicago School of Economics

52:05.280 --> 52:10.480
by the same Milton Friedman who Johnny Harris uncritically presents as some sort of genius,

52:10.480 --> 52:15.280
were shipped in from the US to dictate the direction of social and economic policy.

52:15.280 --> 52:19.920
They took on massive foreign debt via loans from the International Monetary Fund,

52:19.920 --> 52:25.440
opened up natural resources to unregulated corporate exploitation, privatized swaths of

52:25.440 --> 52:31.200
public assets, abolished or privatized public services and social welfare, and opened up the

52:31.200 --> 52:37.360
economy to the free market exploitation of foreign companies. Chile, along with other violently

52:37.360 --> 52:44.160
imposed US-backed neoliberal experiments of the early to mid-70s, was used as something of a lab

52:44.160 --> 52:48.480
to see whether neoliberalism would really work in practice in the way that the rich

52:48.480 --> 52:53.040
had hoped it would. Economic inequality skyrocketed practically immediately.

52:53.040 --> 52:58.000
Wealth was redistributed very effectively from Chile's working class to the richest segments

52:58.960 --> 53:04.480
as well as to the rich of other countries. So the experiment proved a resounding success at its

53:04.480 --> 53:10.880
aim of redistributing wealth and power back to the rich, which inspired implementations of the same

53:10.880 --> 53:17.520
in the West itself. Margaret Thatcher subsequently took power in 1979 in the UK on a neoliberal

53:17.520 --> 53:24.080
platform, while Ronald Reagan became president of the US in 1981. Reagan's economic policy was

53:24.080 --> 53:30.560
written for him directly by the Heritage Foundation, a corporate funded think tank founded by

53:30.560 --> 53:35.360
conservative businessmen to promote neoliberalism in the wake of the collapse of the bread and

53:35.360 --> 53:40.320
wood system. Like literally, they founded it a year or two later. They clearly saw the blood in

53:40.320 --> 53:45.600
the water and were ready to pounce. The results from Chile were then reproduced in those countries.

53:45.600 --> 53:52.560
The share of national income of the top 0.1% of the population in the US and the UK had been falling

53:52.640 --> 53:58.640
throughout the entire post-war period and reached its lowest level in history around 1978,

53:58.640 --> 54:04.240
right before the Thatcher and Reagan era began. In the following two decades as neoliberal policies

54:04.240 --> 54:12.800
were implemented, the trend shifted. Their income share in the UK rose from 1% to 3.5% by 1998 and

54:12.800 --> 54:19.440
2% to 6% in the US. In the latter case, this rivaled the levels of wealth and power held by the

54:19.440 --> 54:25.520
ultra-rich during parts of the Great Depression. This was concurrent with a massive fall in real

54:25.520 --> 54:31.360
wages, meaning average worker wages adjusted for inflation for the purposes of being able

54:31.360 --> 54:37.360
to compare wages at different times. Real wages in the US had grown substantially all throughout

54:37.360 --> 54:42.880
the bread and woods period, then fell slightly due to the oil crisis in the mid-1970s before

54:42.880 --> 54:48.960
stabilizing and rising again. They then completely dropped off a cliff once Reagan introduced neoliberalism

54:48.960 --> 54:56.800
in the 1980s and by the year 2000 had only just managed to recover to 1966 levels. Even today,

54:56.800 --> 55:02.400
real wages in the US are stagnant and are still only around the same level they were in the late

55:02.400 --> 55:08.320
60s. This all happened while GDP growth and increases in productivity levels remain the

55:08.320 --> 55:14.240
same as before. Throughout the bread and woods period, wages increased as the economy grew,

55:14.240 --> 55:20.480
while in the neoliberal period, wages started decreasing, becoming decoupled from economic

55:20.480 --> 55:26.320
growth. This means that what neoliberalism actually achieved wasn't the prosperity that Harris

55:26.320 --> 55:32.320
nauseatingly repeats it did throughout the video, but rather it ensured little more than that huge

55:32.320 --> 55:37.920
shares of income that previously were going to workers would go to the rich instead. I'm getting

55:37.920 --> 55:43.280
ahead of myself a bit here because what I just said actually also contradicts large parts of

55:43.280 --> 55:48.160
Harris's narrative that we haven't even gotten around to yet, including the very next sentence

55:48.160 --> 55:54.080
that he utters. Now, let's contrast the reality of the neoliberal turn that I just went over with

55:54.080 --> 55:59.280
Harris's own explanation for it. More and more people started to believe that we needed to get

55:59.280 --> 56:04.960
government out of capitalism and let the market just do its thing. Now yes, I know that's just a

56:04.960 --> 56:09.840
short summary and that's not the problem here. The problem is that it's just completely wrong

56:09.920 --> 56:15.200
and that even for a short summary, it simplified down to a kindergarten propaganda level.

56:15.200 --> 56:19.760
Capitalism was awesome and magic, so people decided that they wanted the government out of

56:19.760 --> 56:25.440
capitalism and that's how we got neoliberalism. I genuinely am kind of worried that there seems

56:25.440 --> 56:31.200
to be many grown adults out there who this sort of thing works on. Harris then does the whole

56:31.200 --> 56:36.880
world economic forum thing of obscuring neoliberalism by claiming that it's actually shareholder

56:36.880 --> 56:40.960
capitalism, you know, the stuff that we just went over. Since we've already gone over that,

56:40.960 --> 56:46.560
I'm going to skip ahead about 30 seconds to where he argues that Milton Friedman was right

56:46.560 --> 56:52.720
because neoliberalism, according to him, actually did work really well. And his proof for this is

56:52.720 --> 56:58.880
a graph of raw GDP per capita in the USA. And if you look at the data in the United States and the

56:58.880 --> 57:05.360
West, Milton Friedman sort of had a point. Now, first off, I already kind of refuted the argument

57:05.360 --> 57:11.280
that he's making here by showing that after neoliberal reforms in the US, GDP and productivity

57:11.280 --> 57:17.840
continued to rise at the same rates as before, but real wages dropped. But even if GDP per capita

57:17.840 --> 57:23.120
had actually been growing at a higher rate than before during the neoliberal period, as he claims,

57:23.120 --> 57:29.680
the massive drop in real wages would indicate that this increased growth was just going straight

57:29.680 --> 57:34.720
into the pockets of the ultra rich, while normal people were just getting poorer and poorer every

57:34.720 --> 57:41.120
year. This is demonstrative of how GDP and GDP per capita are usually not at all useful measures

57:41.120 --> 57:46.880
of anything actually indicative of living standards on their own. But even if we do ignore all of the

57:46.880 --> 57:52.960
more relevant metrics aside from GDP per capita that show that neoliberalism hasn't actually been

57:52.960 --> 58:00.080
good at all for anyone but the rich, even by Harris's own measure, he's wrong. Since 1870,

58:00.080 --> 58:06.320
real GDP per capita in the USA has grown at a steady rate overall, so much so that its trend

58:06.320 --> 58:11.120
can be charted by a straight line. The growth rate had already recovered to the average rate

58:11.120 --> 58:17.680
throughout US history of around 2% per year. So neoliberalism didn't actually even make the US

58:17.680 --> 58:23.600
economy grow any faster. The growth of the neoliberal period is rather exactly on trend,

58:23.600 --> 58:28.480
with the average rate of growth throughout US history. All up, the growth of the period of

58:28.480 --> 58:35.040
embedded liberalism from 1950 to 1980, where GDP per capita nearly doubled, was actually higher

58:35.040 --> 58:40.880
than the growth from the 30 year period after Reagan brought neoliberalism to the US from 1981

58:40.880 --> 58:48.000
to 2011, where it only increased by 65%. By starting his graph in 1960 and using simple

58:48.000 --> 58:53.200
raw GDP per capita figures, Harris obfuscates this. Though this was probably unintentional and just

58:53.200 --> 58:58.880
the result of him not being good at research, because the first result on Google for USA GDP per

58:58.880 --> 59:06.240
capita is a graph from the World Bank, which his animation lines up with exactly. The reason why his

59:06.240 --> 59:12.320
graph has that rather flat curve during the Bretton Woods era that makes it look like neoliberalism

59:12.320 --> 59:18.240
increased GDP per capita at a higher relative rate afterwards is because this graph is of GDP per

59:18.240 --> 59:25.120
capita in current US dollars, meaning not adjusted for inflation. So the seemingly flatline growth

59:25.120 --> 59:31.920
in the 1960s in Harris's graph is an illusion. Inflation was low and stable, and then it skyrocketed

59:31.920 --> 59:37.360
in the 70s and 80s. Even though this money was worth significantly less relatively, as prices

59:37.360 --> 59:43.120
had greatly increased, the raw GDP per capita number nonetheless still went up as a result.

59:43.200 --> 59:48.400
On Harris's GDP per capita graph, this makes it look like economic growth had shot up from a

59:48.400 --> 59:54.240
rather stagnant curve into a straight line, when in reality it was a straight line the whole time.

59:54.240 --> 59:59.200
Constant US dollar graphs, like the one that I cited, are adjusted for inflation,

59:59.200 --> 01:00:05.600
and the World Bank website, which is where Harris pulled his graph from, also has their own constant

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:11.920
US dollar graph. It's just not the first result on Google. As you can see, it tells quite a different

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:18.160
story from the one that he used. So, this is the first actual source that Harris tries to present

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:23.440
in this video. Three minutes in, after having already made a ton of claims that were just screaming

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:28.240
out to be sourced. It is the first result from Google, and it doesn't actually prove what Harris

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:33.600
claims it does. The opposite is actually true, because inflation adjusted versions of this graph

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:40.240
disprove his claim that Milton Friedman was right, as GDP per capita did not actually grow any faster

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:46.720
after neoliberal reforms. On top of that, GDP per capita used as the only metric here to argue that

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.680
neoliberal policies were making things better would hardly be enough to prove his claim anyway,

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.240
even if the data was actually on his side, since that says absolutely nothing about how that

01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:01.840
income is actually distributed. As you can see, on the odd occasion where Harris does bother to

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:07.360
try and source a claim, it can go pretty catastrophically. Harris continues on from here.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:14.160
And it led to huge prosperity in the West, as the US economy exploded.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:21.360
No, the US economy did not explode, and it did not lead to huge prosperity. The economy grew

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:26.080
at the average historical rate, yet the average person started receiving less of that growth,

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:33.040
proven by real wages falling dramatically, while bottom 50% income share also took a huge nosedive.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:40.000
In my book, personally, that's the exact opposite of huge prosperity. Luckily for him though,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:44.720
Johnny Harris is not beholden to things like actually presenting evidence for his claims,

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:49.840
so he can just say whatever he wants and then move on, treating it as if it's true just because he

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:54.160
said it, which is exactly what he does throughout the entire video and throughout pretty much all

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:59.440
of his videos. Wait a minute, but what about China? Are we talking about China and its economy,

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:04.480
you know, the Middle Kingdom, China? So all the US and Western economies are thriving because of this

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:10.000
corporate free market capitalism that was taking over the world. Okay, so we're finally back to

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:16.320
China, and he prefaces this segment by again confidently stating that the West was thriving

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:22.320
thanks to corporate free market capitalism. It's like he's trying to wheel his version of history

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.800
into existence by just repeating it over and over. We've already established that this just

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:31.280
isn't true. What's interesting about those statements to me is the taking over the world

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:36.320
part because neoliberalism was bad for workers in the West, but it was even worse for people

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:42.000
elsewhere in the world. By focusing so much on the West, Harris misses the forest for the trees.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.280
While neoliberals came to power via elections in much of the Western world, neoliberalism was

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:52.720
imposed by usually US-backed dictatorships in other places. As David Harvey wrote,

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:58.160
How was neoliberalization accomplished and by whom? The answer in countries such as Chile

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:04.720
and Argentina in the 1970s was as simple as it was swift, brutal, and sure. A military coup

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.760
backed by the traditional upper classes as well as by the US government, followed by the fierce

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:14.720
repression of all solidarities created within the labor and urban social movements which had

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:20.320
so threatened their power. So the neoliberal turn for the rest of the world went even worse,

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:27.520
while the Americans, Brits, French, Australians, etc. were merely misled into voting for neoliberalism.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:33.040
For many others outside of the West and outside of the global North, the turn was much more violent,

01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:38.960
being instituted by usually US-backed dictatorships or through coercive loans from international

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:44.960
institutions, aka front organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, with conditions that

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.800
forced the recipients to adopt neoliberal reforms. Many of the countries who received these loans,

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.600
such as Mozambique, had only recently gained independence from colonial rule and were in

01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:01.040
a similar situation to what Europe was in after World War II, in desperate needs of funds to

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:06.480
rebuild. So they simply had no other choice. The same policies were implemented in these countries

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:13.760
as in Chile, the US, and UK with similar effects. Increases in the income share of the rich and

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:19.760
decreases in the income share of everyone else. But in that case, neoliberalism fostered not just

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:25.520
the redistribution of wealth from workers to local rich people, but also from workers to

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:32.720
capitalists in the West, and particularly the US. Now, let's finally see what Harris has to say

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:38.320
about China. So while the US and Western economies are thriving because of this corporate free market

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:44.400
capitalism that was taking over the world, China was descending further and further into decline.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:48.800
Instead of joining the capitalism party that the West was spreading throughout the world,

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:56.720
China resisted, turning to a one-party rule communist system, headed by this guy, Mao Zedong,

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:02.720
who destroyed any chance of China's economy ever joining the prosperity happening around the world.

01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:09.600
By the 1970s, China was a place of widespread poverty, the once prosperous kingdom had reached

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:15.920
rock bottom. This part is really something. So the West was apparently prospering due to

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:21.120
corporate free market capitalism, right? And it was spreading this around the world,

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.520
just kind of out of the goodness of its heart. They just wanted everyone else to enjoy free

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:31.040
market capitalism too. But unfortunately, China was ruled by Mao and the communists,

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:36.560
who were just too stupid and evil to press the big red button marked prosperity and join this

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:42.880
capitalism party. Instead of joining this feisty fiesta, they decided to instead press the poverty

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:49.680
button, and then they hit rock bottom as a result. This is the most generic, propagandistic rhetoric

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:55.920
imaginable. It's precisely how American propaganda has always framed its enemies. Their actions simply

01:05:55.920 --> 01:06:01.520
can't be explained in any way, but by them being innately evil. Because who in their right mind

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:07.200
would oppose the freedom and prosperity that we so generously want to bring them? The entire recent

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:13.760
history of China, like, you know, colonialism and war, which had left the country in destitute poverty

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:18.800
long before the communists had ever taken power, is glossed over in order to make it seem like

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:23.920
there was no possible rational explanation for why China might have been a bit skeptical of the

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:29.840
western capitalism. Rather, China just had two buttons. One that said good things, and one that

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:36.320
said bad things. And they pressed the latter because Mao is evil and hates prosperity. A vague,

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:42.240
undefined, positive sounding term that Harris repeats throughout the video to signal to the

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:47.440
audience when they're supposed to like or dislike something. The implication of this is that any

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:52.640
country that's poor is poor simply because its leaders want it to be. For Johnny Harris,

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:57.840
things need to be this simple, because his video is a propaganda piece made on behalf of the world's

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:02.720
worst billionaires. It's best for him to be uncritical and unthinking and just try to win the

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:08.480
viewer over with sophistry, because basic things like evidence and rudimentary logic aren't on

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:14.160
his side. There's three other things that I want to address about this part. One, Mao was in power

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:21.760
from 1949 to 1976, entirely during the embedded liberalism period, which as we've already gone

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:28.480
over, was not characterized by corporate free market capitalism. So if there was prosperity in

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:34.240
the west during this time, it was due to something quite different than that. Harris once again screws

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:41.040
up his chronology for like the 20th time in this video. Two, Harris refers to the Cold War period,

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:46.800
in which the west was aggressively spreading capitalism throughout the world as the capitalism

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:52.000
party, as if this was something altruistic and as if every other country was free to just copy

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.840
what they were doing and was positioned to be able to do so. This was anything but the case. The vast

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:03.520
majority of countries at this time had no industrial base whatsoever from which to build such a system

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:08.880
off, let alone one nearly as advanced as it was in most western countries. Many of them were also

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:15.360
still colonies or recently liberated former colonies. Most were also overwhelmingly agrarian,

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:21.600
with populations made up mostly of peasants and economies based around primary products like raw

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:27.600
resources or agricultural goods. In short, they were really in no position to just copy what the

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:33.040
richest countries were doing at the time one to one. They needed to industrialize from scratch,

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:38.320
but the west wouldn't let them. The U.S. in particular very aggressively prevented other

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:43.280
countries from replicating anything resembling the policies that characterized the embedded

01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:49.200
liberalism era, like the regulation of markets, controls on capital flows, and forcing companies

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:54.880
to compromise with workers. Those sorts of policies were reserved for themselves and their allies only.

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:59.840
When other poor countries tried to industrialize in much the same ways that they had, tried to

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:04.560
regulate the ability of foreign countries to extract their resources, or did pretty much

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:10.320
anything aimed at curbing the power of corporations to better conditions for normal people, the USA

01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:16.480
and their allies would step in to try and stop or at least impede their progress. Guatemala,

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:22.400
Indonesia, and Iran are just free examples out of the many countries they targeted that were

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:27.920
trying to pursue regulated capitalist paths to development because that was inconvenient for

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:32.320
the profit of the west. So they intervened to ensure that they were violently stopped from

01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:38.240
doing so, with at least hundreds of thousands of people being killed as a result. So there was no

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:43.680
capitalism party that was just open to be joined. Harris' characterization of events is not just

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:49.360
simplified, it is outright wrong and intentionally misleading propaganda. At least I hope it is

01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.160
because I really hope that he's not this dumb. He needs to have a simplistic villain who solely

01:09:54.160 --> 01:10:00.240
threw their own personal, irrational evil, prevented China from joining the good guys and doing

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:06.240
capitalism to become prosperous because the reality casts this supposed party of free market

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:13.280
capitalism in a much less flattering light. Free. The Maoist period in China was definitely

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:19.520
not rock bottom. Living standards actually improved greatly during it and the overall economy expanded

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:25.040
at a decent, steady rate, even despite major catastrophes like the Great Leap Forward. GDP

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:30.640
per capita grew by about 2% per year, which is not incredible or anything, but still better than

01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:35.440
before, and around the same as the average growth rate of the US economy throughout its history.

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:40.000
This economic growth data also has to be considered with the caveat that the Chinese economy at the

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.720
time was run fundamentally differently. Its income was allocated more equally and it had

01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:50.240
provisions for basic needs that GDP, designed to measure economic activity in a market economy,

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:56.320
can fail to account for. GDP is already a highly imperfect way of measuring production even in

01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:02.560
a capitalist country. In a socialist and largely agrarian, non-market one, it's even less useful.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:08.400
More direct indicators of living standards are much more useful. By 1978, peasants were earning

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:14.160
more than double the raw income they had earned in 1954, a trend confirmed by its replication

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.440
across multiple different data sets and metrics. Raw income among the urban population doubled

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:24.240
as well. This is also corroborated by the doubling of real expenditure per individual,

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:30.080
meaning how much money the average individual person was spending per year adjusted for inflation.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:34.960
The purchasing power of the average person doubling in less than 30 years is at least

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:41.600
a half decent increase in prosperity, in my opinion. Daily caloric intake increased. Life

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:49.840
expectancy shot up very rapidly, rising from 40 in 1953 to 65 in 1978. Infant mortality dropped

01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:57.600
from 175 deaths per 1,000 births to 37 per 1,000. Access to education was greatly expanded,

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:05.840
with primary school enrollment rates increasing from 48% in 1952 to 94% in 1978. Literacy rates

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:11.680
also correspondingly increased rapidly. So, contrary to Harris' fairytale narrative of

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:17.040
there just being a big bad man who hated good things for no apparent reason, the Communist

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:24.080
Party at the time both wanted to make China more prosperous and did so. Assuming here that prosperity

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:28.960
means living standards improving, Harris never actually tells us what he means by that word,

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:34.800
so I'm kind of guessing. And it certainly wasn't anywhere near rock bottom, especially not compared

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.760
to the previous hundred years or so, which were full of war and colonization, much of it at the

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:45.680
hands of these same Western capitalist countries that Harris spends most of his video praising.

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:52.880
I also want to note that the photos that Harris uses here are not actually of the 1970s as he claims,

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:58.880
but rather from the 1900s to the 1940s. They're squarely from the period of nationalist, aka

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:04.720
Western-aligned, rule. It seems like he went looking for photos of poverty from the 1970s to

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:09.760
back up his argument, but wasn't able to find them, so decided to instead present photos from

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:15.680
before the Communist ever came to power as evidence of them being bad. Kind of slimy, dude.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:22.000
Next, Harris moves on to China's market reforms in the late 1970s under Deng Xiaoping,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.800
because the entire point of him even talking about the Mao era was just to make it sound as

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:31.840
horrible and illogical and evil as possible, to then frame everything that followed it as even

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:36.400
more amazing in comparison. The worse that he can make the former sound, the better the latter

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:42.240
sounds in contrast, helping with the overarching, childish, uncritical celebration of free market

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:47.760
capitalism as some sort of magic narrative of the video. The once prosperous kingdom

01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:51.200
had reached rock bottom, but that was all about to change.

01:13:54.480 --> 01:14:02.000
So it's the 1970s and this is China's new leader, Deng Xiaoping. He came into power hoping to turn

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:09.680
around this 150 years of humiliation in China, the decline of China as a superpower. Elsewhere in the

01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:16.080
region, China's neighbors had economies that joined the global economic party that was happening

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:22.880
in capitalism and they were thriving. They saw immense economic miracles and pulled millions

01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:28.480
out of poverty. Really all he does is just make statements and then use positive sounding adjectives

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:34.080
to tell the audience what they're supposed to think and feel. Thriving economic miracles.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:38.880
The reality of what happened in these countries is nowhere near as simplistic as Harris needed to

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:44.640
be for his propaganda to work. Singapore and Hong Kong, for example, are tiny city-states.

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:50.080
Used as hubs for global finance and trade due to their unique status as separate jurisdictions

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:54.880
from much larger neighboring countries. And they only even came to have this status in the first

01:14:54.880 --> 01:15:00.000
place due to unique historical circumstances related to colonialism. That's not something that

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:04.960
can at all be replicated in the vast majority of countries, let alone a massive one like China.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:10.480
And whether replicating it would even be desirable at all is also very questionable. Given that Hong

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:15.440
Kong, despite its very high levels of gross wealth, has one of the worst poverty rates in the

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:20.400
entire global north and hundreds of thousands of people who live in what are basically cages

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:25.200
because they can't afford anything else. Singapore is also hardly a model of the

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:30.720
corporate free market capitalism that Harris is trying to promote. Singapore is widely considered

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:36.160
in the academic literature to have developed via state capitalism. A highly government-directed

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:41.040
form of capitalism with considerable state control and ownership of important sectors

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:46.320
of the economy. They directed economic policy and leveraged state power at every step of the

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:51.840
way, which resulted in the government being the most important economic actor in the country by far.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:57.440
This has resulted in an economy where, quoting a paper on the matter, the shareholder-centric

01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:04.320
corporation virtually does not exist and where the state owns 37% of the stock market capitalization,

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:11.040
95% of the land, 80% of the housing, etc. Quite contrary to Harris's notion of

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:16.800
shareholder capitalism having created prosperity. Of the other countries that Harris points to,

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:23.040
the three most worth looking at are Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Due to the context of the Cold

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:28.160
War and the end of World War II, the USA attempted to bring all of these countries under its hegemony

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:32.880
by providing them with considerable economic aid like it had with the Marshall Plan in Western

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:38.240
Europe. Because of this, they were able to pursue levels of state economic intervention and planning

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:43.280
that weren't nearly as tolerated in countries not aligned with the West. And this state direction

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:49.040
was pervasive, especially in Taiwan and South Korea, which were ruled by outright military

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:54.800
dictatorships all the way up until the late 80s and early 90s. South Korea had straight up,

01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:02.240
actual five-year plans inspired by the USSR all the way up until the 1990s, painting their economic

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:08.160
growth as due to the simple wonders of free market capitalism is very misleading. Economist

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:14.480
Ha Jun Chang commented on the common misconception that these countries followed mainstream free

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:19.920
market style policies. Many of the things that the East Asian government officials did in the

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:25.120
miracle years, protecting infant industries, forcefully mobilizing resources away from

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:30.560
technologically stagnant agriculture into the dynamic industrial sector, and exploiting the

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:36.480
linkages across different sectors, contradict the free market view. Had the East Asian countries,

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.360
and indeed most of the rich countries in Europe and North America before them, run their economies

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:45.520
according to the principles of free market economics, they would not have developed their

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:50.640
economies in the way they have. All of this is especially true of the period that Harris is

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:55.840
covering here. These countries did eventually adopt neoliberal dogma in the 80s and 90s,

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:59.680
dialing back the state intervention that had characterized their economies throughout the

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:06.560
50s, 60s, and 70s. But the Chinese government's market reforms happened in the 1970s, so clearly

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:12.640
they were not inspired by what he calls corporate free market capitalism in East Asia because it

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:17.360
didn't exist there yet. I've said this already but it's worth repeating. Harris's content,

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:22.880
and indeed a lot of other content on YouTube, relies a whole lot on just confidently stating

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:27.840
things that aren't true as if they are. Without even trying to actually substantiate these claims

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:32.960
either, they're acting like the point has been proven regardless, and moving on to making another

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:38.160
fundamentally incorrect statement that also rests on the previous one, and all of the others

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:44.320
before that, having been true. So his whole narrative here of free market capitalist prosperity

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:48.400
has been crafted on a very, very long chain of falsehoods.

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:56.080
Deng specifically went on a visit to Singapore early on in his term, where ethnic Chinese had

01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:02.480
adopted the free market, and they were thriving. He felt inspired. The malice economic doctrine

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:08.480
that had failed was over, and it was time to see if China could rebuild its economy,

01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:14.720
experimenting with some version of capitalism. People didn't adopt the free market. That's

01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:19.680
not how this works. You can't just individually decide that you want to do free market capitalism.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:24.000
No more than I can just individually decide that I want to do communism. These are overarching

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:29.520
socioeconomic systems, not individual choices. These people lived under capitalism not because

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:33.680
they had adopted it, but rather just because they happened to live in a capitalist society.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:38.960
But yeah, we've already been over what Singapore actually is and was, which conflicts greatly with

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:43.920
Harris's narrative here. What do you think it was that Chinese government officials may have seen

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:48.400
when they visited Singapore? That Chinese people are capable of running businesses,

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.960
like they have some sort of essential business running essence or something that they want to

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:59.280
wear off before, or a state-led economy that they might have been able to learn something from

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:04.240
for their own state-led economic reforms in their country? You don't need to think about it very

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:09.600
hard to arrive at the latter conclusion, because the first option is kind of ridiculous, and that

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:14.560
is in fact the case. The Communist Party came to see Singapore as something of a reference,

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:20.320
precisely because it was an example of an already existing model in which the state remained economically

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:26.560
dominant. But apart from that, Harris's timeline is again just totally messed up. Deng visited

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:33.040
Singapore in 1978, the same year in which the economic reforms in China began, but he and other

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:38.720
Chinese officials didn't start to promote Singapore as a special model to be followed in China

01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:43.920
until 1992. Before that, it was just one of many different places that they'd studied,

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:49.840
so their decision to begin market reforms itself has really nothing to do with Singapore. For Harris,

01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:55.040
though, it's very convenient to reduce a complicated, multi-causal decision, one which was

01:20:55.040 --> 01:21:00.320
itself the result of power struggles in the Communist Party, to a simple Eureka-style moment

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:06.720
of epiphany. After decades of the evil Mao denying his people prosperity, along with other positive

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:12.880
sounding nouns, Deng saw the glory of the free market firsthand in Singapore, and he was so

01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:18.400
awed by its incredible greatness that he had no choice but to go home and immediately replicate

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:24.400
it. It comes off as a childish, apocryphal propaganda story because it is one. In reality,

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:29.520
the reforms were already underway beforehand, the visit to Singapore was very short and uneventful,

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:34.240
the Chinese government only started paying special attention to Singapore 14 years later,

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:39.200
and the reason they did so didn't actually have much to do with free market capitalism at all,

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:45.120
rather something quite antifical to it. China's turn to a market-based but still state-dictated

01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:50.480
economy has infinitely more to do with other factors, like the aforementioned political conflicts,

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:55.280
chiefly among them the one of the Soviet Union. So yeah, firstly, there was that,

01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:01.440
which led to China and the USA establishing diplomatic relations again in 1972. Before this,

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:07.040
the People's Republic of China had no access to international governance systems like the UN,

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:11.280
as they were mostly controlled by the West, who had still considered the Republic of China

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:16.640
government in Taiwan as the legitimate government of all of China. So suddenly, all of the world's

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:22.160
most important and richest markets, made up of many countries who had spent the previous century

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:28.080
colonizing China and most of the rest of the world, were now finally open to China. This was a drastic

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:33.120
and sudden change in circumstances that enabled options that were previously closed to them,

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:38.160
like foreign investment from the advanced capitalist countries and the ability to export to them.

01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:43.840
Second, Deng Xiaoping had been inspired by the new economic policy of the Soviet Union.

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:48.560
After the Russian Revolution, the Soviet government under Lenin decided that because

01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:54.320
the country was overwhelmingly agrarian, much like China was, that they would allow a state-directed

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:59.040
capitalism in the hopes of developing an advanced industrial capitalist society,

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:03.920
because Karl Marx had theorized that that would be something of a prerequisite for communism.

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:09.440
This was highly successful, as the USSR rapidly recovered from the devastation of its civil war

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:15.600
and World War I. In 1961, following the disastrous attempt at rapid industrialization known as the

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:21.840
Great Leap Forward, Deng was then already the key player in an ill-fated attempt to implement

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:27.120
NEP-style reforms in China, to industrialize China in a very different way to the one that Mao

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:33.520
had just tried. So the idea before the market reforms that he started to implement in 1978

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:38.560
was not actually new at all, not in the history of China, nor in the history of communism,

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:44.160
nor even in Deng's own political career. So the international conditions that enabled China's

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:50.400
market reforms only came to be in the 1970s, and that clearest precedent and inspiration didn't

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:57.040
come from the West in the 1970s, but from the East in the 1920s, and they had been proposed in China

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:02.800
since at least the 1960s. If it isn't already clear from everything that we've just gone over,

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:08.960
Harris' narrative of China joining the capitalist party in the West is also just plain chronologically

01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:15.600
impossible. He clearly means to imply that China was inspired by free markets, neoliberal capitalism,

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:20.320
rather than the embedded liberalism of the Bretton Woods period, given his constant references to

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:25.440
arch neoliberal Milton Friedman, his earlier delineation between the Bretton Woods period

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:30.320
and the neoliberal period that came after, and the fact that he outright praises free market

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:35.760
capitalism like a dozen times, actually more than that. But China's reforms actually started

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:42.880
before the turn to neoliberalism in the West. They started in 1978. Thatcher was elected in 1979,

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:48.560
Reagan in 1981, so they couldn't have been inspired by Friedman-style neoliberal reforms there,

01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:53.360
because they hadn't even been implemented on a national level yet. In this video, it really

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:58.800
seems like Harris has like an uncontrollable desire to use the term West as synonymous with

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:03.920
correct and good. His presentation of the world is one where it's just kind of self-evident,

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:09.520
that the only way forward is to copy the superior West. If something happened that he considers to

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:14.800
be good, he does everything possible to ultimately credit it to Western influences or inspirations,

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:19.440
without feeling any sort of need to actually back that up, or check whether his argument even

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:23.840
makes any chronological sense, or consider the possibility that Chinese people might be

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:29.280
capable of thinking for themselves, having their own ideas, or being inspired by anything other

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:34.160
than the same countries that had colonized and devastated their own. This is juxtaposed with

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.800
his treatment of Mao, who was apparently just completely irrational and evil, because that's

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:44.000
the only way that Harris can apparently think of that could possibly explain someone not simply

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.600
copying the superior West. It comes off as at least a little bit racist. In the next bit,

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:55.360
Harris reduces all of Deng's market reforms to just him focusing on one little village,

01:25:55.360 --> 01:26:00.480
the special economic zone of Shenzhen. He frames it like Deng started out by creating a little

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:05.760
secret capitalist project, developing this one town into a bustling industrial city. But the

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:11.280
reality is that this was just one small part of a much wider reform program, which also included

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:15.920
free other special economic zones established in free other places at the same time. So why

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:22.400
does he focus on it so heavily? This remark makes it clear. Deng Xiaoping designated this little town

01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:29.680
as quote a special economic zone, where foreign companies could set up and invest in a very

01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:35.360
capitalistic free market, claiming China's highly regulated very state directed system,

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:40.480
as some sort of success of free market capitalism would obviously be ridiculous. So in an attempt

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:46.240
to get around this complication, Harris, providing no evidence for his claims at all, says that Shenzhen

01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:50.560
had a free market, and then he just casually acts like that represented the rest of China,

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:55.040
and that it was replicated everywhere else. Despite having done absolutely nothing to even

01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:00.880
remotely argue for or evidence this extremely false claim, he then uses it as the basis to

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:06.800
claim China as a whole as a victory of the same type of free market capitalism that Milton Friedman

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:12.720
This starts happening all over China, and meanwhile Milton Friedman's back in the U.S. being like

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:21.840
Yep. Told ya. Soon there were a bunch of cities designated in China for special economic activity

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.880
or basically capitalism in a socialist country. Something I haven't mentioned yet is that big

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:31.280
parts of his narrative here are just ripped straight from the World Economic Forum propaganda

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:35.760
book that is being paid to promote here. I've actually been giving Harris way too much credit.

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:39.840
He didn't come up with like half of this stuff himself. The Singapore story,

01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:45.040
followed immediately by the Shenzhen story, comes straight from the book, but Harris actually went

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:50.000
even further than the book did. Its description of China's special economic zones is simply that

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.560
there are places where foreign companies were allowed to operate with some tax incentives

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:59.520
under government-imposed conditions in contrast to the rest of the country where such enterprises

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:05.440
were entirely illegal, a surprisingly accurate description, and far from free market capitalism.

01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:10.160
Sometimes you can just refer back to the very book that he's advertising here and use it to

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:16.000
refute him. Anyway, so onto the Milton Friedman part. Friedman absolutely did not approve of

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.240
China's state-led economy. He certainly may have liked it more than what it had before,

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:25.760
but it was far from anything close to resembling his neoliberal ideal. We have direct evidence of

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:30.640
this because Friedman actually went to China and spoke with Communist Party officials who outright

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:35.120
argued against him about the very fundamentals of his beliefs. They had major disagreements

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.680
on topics like private property rights, state interference in the market, and state economic

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:45.440
planning. If anything, China proved Friedman wrong that the sort of government interference that he

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:50.960
so despised could achieve what he'd claimed it couldn't, but Harris, undeterred by the truth,

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:56.080
just inverts reality yet again and claims the exact opposite. One of the things you might have noticed

01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:00.960
that Harris does a lot in this video is to muddy the distinction between different types of capitalism,

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:06.000
ironically while also trying to create his own distinction between different types of capitalism.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:12.000
His video is very overtly pro-free market capitalism specifically, yet in one sentence

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.200
he'll talk about how great the free market is, and then in the next he'll just say capitalism

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:22.400
alone. And this last bit about China is where this muddying of the waters came to its head.

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:27.840
China has obviously never had anything resembling free market capitalism. Harris pays a tiny little

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:38.080
bit of lip service to this fact for like a second, then just forgets that he ever said that and

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:43.520
immediately continues on as if China is nonetheless an example of the free market dogma that is trying

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:48.160
to promote. It's the same thing that he did earlier when he claimed the Bretton Woods period

01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:53.280
and the Marshall Plan as examples of miracles of the free market rather than the heavy state

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:58.800
economic interference, planning, and control that actually characterizes them. Johnny Harris

01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:03.680
in the corporations that the World Economic Forum represents probably wouldn't be very happy if we

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:08.880
went and looked at the actual reality of China's state-led economy with fairly routine executions

01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:13.840
of billionaires and took it as a model to be followed, yet such is capitalist propaganda,

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:19.360
contradictory by nature. China becoming a world power through heavy state intervention and very

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:24.560
directed and deliberate government-led economic policy doesn't fit into their narrative of what

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:29.040
kind of economic policies are supposed to work best, so they need to obfuscate those facts and

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:33.920
find roundabout ways to claim that it's actually still somehow an example of the wonders of free

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:39.760
market capitalism. This video is a fine example of that practice. But wait, I haven't yet actually

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:44.640
provided any evidence for my claim that China doesn't have a free market economy. Silly me,

01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:50.000
allow me to cite a source, a book called Stakeholder Capitalism, by the founder and head

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:56.560
of the World Economic Forum. In recent decades, another form of capitalism emerged as an alternative,

01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:02.480
state capitalism. In China, to take the most notable example, the private sector now produces

01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:08.240
more than 60% of GDP. Despite this, the state is still considered the most important stakeholder

01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:12.880
and retains power over individual shareholders. The government achieves its dominant role in at

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:18.320
least free ways. First, it keeps a strong hand in the distribution of resources and opportunities.

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:23.680
Second, it can intervene in virtually any industry. And third, it can direct the economy

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:29.840
by means of large-scale infrastructure, research and development, education, healthcare, or housing

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:37.280
projects. So Harris' video is fundamentally based on this idea that China is a success of free market

01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:43.280
capitalism, of freemanite neoliberalism, to the extent that China supposedly stands as proof

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:48.800
that Milton Friedman was right. Yet the book that he was paid to promote in this video says

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:54.240
something entirely different. That it's the prime example of something very different to the neoliberalism

01:31:54.240 --> 01:32:00.240
that it misleadingly calls shareholder capitalism and stakeholder capitalism. The book even gives

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:06.080
this state capitalism props, saying that, were it not for state capitalism, large parts of the

01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:10.960
developing world may not have seen a major growth spurred at all. Yet Harris frames it entirely

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:16.400
differently, as if the free market is actually to thank for the perceived successes of state-led

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:21.760
interventionist economies. I don't mean to give the book any credit here, it's garbage, ghost-ridden

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:26.240
propaganda. It only acknowledges these things because they're undeniable, and it does so to

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:31.280
create this false impression of nuance so that the reader is more likely to be convinced by its main

01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:35.760
argument that the way to fix the problems of neoliberal capitalism is with more neoliberal

01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:41.200
capitalism, along with a nice helping of giving corporations even more power. I just think it's

01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:45.760
telling that Harris clearly read the book, given that he both claimed to have done so, and that

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:51.200
parts of his video seem to come directly from it. Yet to sustain his argument that everything good

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:57.600
ever is all thanks to the West's amazing free market capitalism, he still has to editorialize

01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:02.880
the World Economic Forum Propaganda Book to get rid of the parts where the book is frank about the

01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:07.440
fact that the things that he's crediting to the wonders of Milton Friedman are actually due to

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:13.920
something very different. Harris's video comes off as even more of a piece of unthinking capitalist

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:19.920
propaganda than the literal World Economic Forum Propaganda Book does. Now, let's move on to the

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:25.120
big graph moment of the video, which comes out of nowhere after Harris is finally done lying to us

01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:28.800
about how neoliberal capitalism actually saved the world and made everything better

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.640
contrary to what all the evidence shows.

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:33.200
I have two graphs I want to show you.

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:42.880
They look like this. Okay, let's look at this one first. It's called the elephant graph. Do you

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:50.400
sort of see why? Let's deconstruct this graph and try to understand what this says about the

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:57.040
past 30 years of the rise of China. On this axis is everyone on earth ranked by their income

01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:02.880
grouped into percentiles. So these people down here make an income that is the 10th percentile,

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:08.400
the lowest 10% in the world, and then the 20th percentile, and so on and so on. Up to these

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:12.560
people up here who are the richest in the world, they have an income that puts them in the 90th

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:19.520
percentile. This axis here shows how much growth in income these people have had over the past 35

01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:24.480
years, basically during the heyday of shareholder capitalism and the rise of China. So you'll

01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:29.520
see how this plays out in just a second. Let's start plotting how much income growth each of these

01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:37.360
groups saw over the past 35 years. The bottom 10% saw their incomes grow by around 75%, not bad.

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:42.640
These are people who live in the poorest countries who make the lowest income in the world. The 20

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:50.480
to 30 percentile saw huge growth in their income, 125% and more over the past 35 years. This is like

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:56.480
the new middle class in China and other Asian countries who saw huge income growth due to

01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:01.520
globalization. They did really well under this system. Just want to pause for a second here to

01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:07.120
note how Harris is again claiming China for what he calls shareholder capitalism, despite the very

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:13.040
book that he's promoting calling it something very different. But then you start to get to the

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:19.840
people in the 50th and 60th and 70th and 80th percentile. This is basically people who live

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:26.640
in the middle class in the West. Their incomes have grown much slower, sometimes under 50%

01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:33.040
over the course of 35 years, which is little over 1% a year, not very much income growth.

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:38.560
So did you notice the contradiction there? It's a pretty big one. Harris goes his entire video

01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:45.280
telling us how awesome shareholder capitalism was for the West, how it made the economy explode,

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:50.880
and how it proved Milton Friedman right. But then the graph that his entire video led up to

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:56.480
paints a different picture. Now it seems that things actually didn't go that great for people

01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:01.680
in the West. There's no consistency in this video at all. He just contradicts himself so often.

01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:05.120
And some of these people in the West have seen their incomes shrink,

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:10.400
like the blue-collar workers in Detroit and the rust belt whose jobs disappeared to China.

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:17.280
So so far you can sort of see why this makes sense. The people in China who benefited from this mass

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:23.520
industrialization saw huge benefits. And the people here in the United States and in the West

01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:29.920
who saw jobs go overseas to China saw a way slower growth in their income.

01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:36.160
So this part is kind of ridiculous. Harris blames production moving to China for that portion of

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:40.880
the graph having comparatively less growth. But as we've already established, the US economy

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:45.520
continued to grow at the same average rate that it always had. And given that the income shares

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:50.800
of the top percentiles saw massive increases that work on current with this, it's clear that the

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:55.760
extra income from this growth was taken from them and given to the rich in their country,

01:36:55.760 --> 01:37:00.080
rather than to normal people in China who are at the very bottom end of this graph,

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:04.160
Harris just can't seem to help himself here. He has to find some way in which he can blame

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:09.040
your woes on Chinese people, rather than the capitalists who are actually to blame because,

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:14.000
well, they're paying him to make this video, aren't they? I'll let him finish his spiel on the graph now.

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:31.200
get us a little bit more granular. These are the people who have the highest incomes in the world.

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:36.400
Let's see how their income has grown over the past 35 years.

01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:44.560
You can see that their income has exploded under this system. They're seeing tripling of their

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:50.400
income in the past 35 years. Now, a reminder that this is 35 years of data from every economy on

01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:55.680
earth. This shows everyone on the planet. So this gives us a view of who are the winners and the

01:37:55.680 --> 01:38:01.920
losers of this shareholder capitalism that has globalized to Asia and around the world. The top

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:09.280
1% of income earners saw the biggest benefits from this system. They are the ones who disproportionately

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:13.680
benefit from shareholder capitalism and the growth of globalization.

01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:19.040
Again, wait, wasn't this supposed to actually be super awesome for the West?

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:23.280
So awesome that it inspired China to copy it all? He said this earlier.

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:27.120
So all the US and Western economies are thriving because of this corporate,

01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.680
free market capitalism that was taking over the world.

01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:34.160
But his own framing of this graph is kind of contradicting that quite a bit.

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.840
Whatever. Anyway, so you probably won't be too surprised to find that this graph is extremely

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:45.920
cherry-picked. It compares income growth rate, not actual income. For an example of why this

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:52.240
is not exactly very indicative of anything, let's say you make $1,000 a year and your income increases

01:38:52.240 --> 01:39:00.880
by, say, 125%, like it did in this part of the graph here. Then you're now making $2,250 a year,

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:08.000
$1,250 more. But if someone say from this part of the graph, which Harris claims represents

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:14.880
the Western middle class, is making $50,000 a year, and this grows by only 45%, which seems much

01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:23.920
lower in comparison, then that income has increased to $72,500 a year, or $22,500 more, which in

01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:30.560
numeric terms is 18 times more than the increase in income of those in the lower percentile.

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:35.760
So while that income might be growing at a slower rate, that's not really indicative of anything

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:40.480
useful on its own. Those in the middle can still be getting a much larger share of raw

01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:45.600
global income than those at the bottom. The reason why propagandists like to use this so-called

01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:50.880
elephant graph, comparing income growth instead of numerical increases in income, is because the

01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:56.480
latter graph completely destroys the narrative that this elephant graph is used to push, that

01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:01.920
free market neoliberalism has actually been mostly beneficial and has only been slightly negative for

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:07.120
a relatively small group of people in the West. That's wrong, and it would be even if we assumed,

01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:12.640
for the sake of argument, that China, which makes up the vast majority of the growth in those lower

01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:17.840
income sections of the graph, has a free market economy. The YouTuber Unlearning Economics has a

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:22.960
great video about this whole narrative of neoliberal progress, where he specifically refutes the abuse

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:26.240
of the elephant graph, so I'm just going to play that clip to explain it to you more.

01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:31.520
The elephant shape comes because the gains at the very bottom of the global distribution

01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:36.240
on the left hand of the graph have been low. Moving right along the x-axis, we can see they

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:40.880
are much higher for the global middle class, are low again for the middle class of rich countries,

01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:46.640
and are high again for the very rich. This paints a picture of globalization as a largely positive,

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:51.680
albeit flawed, process, compressing the global income distribution by creating a much larger

01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:56.560
global middle class, while neglecting the middle classes of the rich world, which have seen high

01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:01.760
and possibly rising income inequality within their borders. But the elephant graph hides an

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:08.080
assumption which is pervasive in these debates. These are relative changes, expressed in percentages.

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:12.800
If you look at the raw changes in income, shown on this graph, the income gains are largely

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:17.600
flattened at the bottom of the distribution, and the graph takes the familiar hockey stick shape,

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:21.600
albeit with a slight bump in the middle, due to the impressive growth of China and other

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:26.400
Southeast Asian countries. This is also in Lakhnar and Milanovic's original paper,

01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:31.680
though the elephant version has been shared more widely. Although incomes rose by 60% for both the

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:36.720
top 1%, and those in the middle of the global income distribution, this was an absolute increase

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:44.400
of $23,000 for the top 1%, but just $800 for the middle. The rich gained the same in relative terms,

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:49.360
but 30 times as much in absolute terms. The elephant shows the former measurement,

01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:53.840
while the hockey stick shows the latter. The implication of this is pretty clear.

01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:58.720
Almost all of the growth in the global economy was captured by those at the top of the distribution,

01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:03.280
failing to go to those who need it most. Yeah, you heard that right. Both of these

01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:08.800
graphs are from the same paper, yet those who pushed this narrative took one of them and ignored

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:14.960
the other. I wonder why? Take a look at the income growth of the bottom 20% here. Their incomes

01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:21.760
increased by $217 in 30 years, adjusted for inflation, and purchasing power between different

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:27.520
countries. Now, what about someone in the top 80%, in line with the western middle class?

01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:35.920
Their incomes increased by $2,218. 10 times more. Again, this is adjusted for purchasing power parity,

01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:40.080
so it's not like that money is worthless due to the higher prices of goods in richer countries.

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:45.760
It is actually just straight up 10 times more. So clearly, it's not the poor Chinese factory

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:51.840
worker whose income has increased by a whopping $217 in 30 years, who's robbed the average

01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:56.960
westerner of their share of economic growth. It's the people represented on the far right side of

01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:03.440
the graph, whose incomes increased by 28 times that of the global average. The elephant graph

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:09.120
was cherry picked by the World Economic Forum, Harris, and many other propagandists to mask

01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:15.120
inconvenient facts for their narratives like these. So, Harris started out by claiming that

01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:20.720
neoliberalism, which he calls shareholder capitalism and free market capitalism, increased

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:26.960
economic growth in the west by using a misleading graph of per capita GDP, which was not adjusted

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:32.400
for inflation. Now, he's implying that neoliberalism was actually disadvantageous for most people in

01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:37.760
the west, and that there was a massive redistribution in income from them to the rest of the world,

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:43.840
and the richest 1% and up. This narrative is not only incredibly contradictory, but also untrue.

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:49.840
There was a massive redistribution in income, yes, but only to the top 1%. The empirical data,

01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:55.600
no matter what metrics you use, no matter what variables you adjust by, consistently shows this.

01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:01.120
Neoliberalism has accomplished absolutely nothing but the redistribution of income from the majority

01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:07.280
of people to the richest people, and it's like that by design. So, next and finally,

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:11.280
Harris shows us a graph of global CO2 emissions for some reason.

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:19.120
The second graph looks like this. This shows the amount of CO2 emissions by country.

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:24.400
You've got Europe and the United States, and then up here you've got China, the world's

01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:31.600
largest emitter of CO2. Like the elephant graph, this graph combines loads of data to show us that

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:38.080
shareholder capitalism focuses so much on short-term profits for shareholders that it leaves out any

01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:44.800
consideration for how this economic activity affects the planet we live on and our ability to live on it.

01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:49.360
He makes sure to point out that China now has the world's largest share of global CO2 emissions,

01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:53.440
when you measure them by country at least, neglecting to mention that until, like,

01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:58.400
a couple of weeks ago actually, China had the world's largest population, congratulations India,

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:02.000
and it still hasn't approached the per capita emissions of the West,

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.480
and especially not the US, where the average person emits about three times more than the

01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:11.120
average Chinese person. And given that Harris also noted in his video that

01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:17.920
And more and more foreign companies flocked to China for its cheap labor. It became the world's factory.

01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:23.120
Then it would stand to reason that a fair bit of those emissions are also on behalf of the West.

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:26.800
Yet they still count against China and not against them.

01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:31.600
His analysis of this graph is very short and just seems kind of tacked on in superfluous,

01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:35.040
like he wanted to throw in a token acknowledgement of climate change at the end,

01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:39.520
so that he could subsequently imply that stakeholder capitalism would magically fix it,

01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:44.160
while also driving home the general sort of anti-China vibe of this part of the video.

01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:49.600
Right after him telling us how awesome it was that China finally came to its senses and copied

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:56.080
the free market capitalism that's work so great for the West, there's this jarring tone shift.

01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:00.560
Now it seems that free market capitalism hasn't actually gone that well for the West.

01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:04.080
China's success also came at the expense of the average Westerner,

01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:07.520
and China even bears massive blame for climate change.

01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:12.160
So which is it? Is China an awesome example of free market capitalism success,

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:16.560
or a massive threat to the livelihood and well-being of the average person in the West?

01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:20.240
What's really most jarring about this to me though is that it seems like

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:22.800
people don't really notice when he does this.

01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:26.560
At least from reading the comments, you won't really see anyone picking up on these sorts of

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:31.920
contradictions and incoherency. Kind of worrying to me, and I hope that maybe my video will

01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:36.000
sort of encourage people to consume YouTube content, not just Johnny Harris videos,

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.880
but all YouTube content with a bit more of a critical eye.

01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:44.000
Anyway, so it's especially nonsensical for Harris to bring up climate change in this video,

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.760
because the only actual evidence that he presents throughout the entire video

01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:53.200
for the supposed success of free market capitalism was that one graph of raw GDP growth.

01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:59.600
For Harris, growth is just sort of good in of itself, and it improves what he calls prosperity,

01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:04.240
yet that is precisely the sort of thinking that led to runaway climate change.

01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:07.920
The reality is that, as the last 40 to 50 years have shown,

01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:12.560
there is not necessarily an automatic correlation between economic growth

01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:17.040
and improvements in living standards. Growth just means more national income,

01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:22.480
and if most or all of that extra income is being distributed straight to the people on top,

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:27.200
the benefits for everyone else will be marginal or non-existent, while the costs,

01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:32.400
like the impending climate catastrophe, will be shouldered primarily by everyone outside of

01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:38.000
that privileged minority. And this is a big reason why capitalism just is never going to

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:42.800
work that well for most people. While, particularly in state-directed forms,

01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:48.240
it does grow wealth better than the systems that came before it, it also creates a tiny minority

01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:54.480
of people with immense economic and thus political power, which they then use to ensure two things.

01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:59.040
One, that efforts at power and income redistribution are stunted as much as possible,

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:02.720
so that as much of this growth as possible goes straight to themselves.

01:48:02.720 --> 01:48:08.320
And two, that this growth continues as unabated as possible in order to ensure themselves as much

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:13.520
income as possible, even as this makes the planet increasingly less habitable for humans.

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:18.480
The World Economic Forum is the most important representative body of exactly that class of

01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:23.920
people, and Johnny Harris was paid by them to make this video about how awesome economic growth has

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:29.520
supposedly been throughout the last 40 to 50 years or so, you know, with some very minor caveats,

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:33.920
like runaway climate change and immense inequality that they only acknowledged because

01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:38.720
they're now completely impossible to deny. But don't worry, they swear they'll fix them for

01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:43.760
us out of the goodness of their hearts if we just adopt their vision of a new form of capitalism,

01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:47.840
which is not only fundamentally the same as the old form of capitalism, but which would

01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:52.160
also just so happen to hand them, the ones who cause these problems in the first place,

01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:58.000
copious amounts of additional direct governmental power. Yeah, that sounds like a great idea.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:02.960
Anyway, so after the CO2 emissions graph part, the conclusion that we dissected at the beginning

01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:07.600
of the video begins. So we're pretty much done here. There's really just little about this video

01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:13.040
that makes any sense without the context of it just being a particularly poorly made propaganda

01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:17.360
piece. It's just a guy presenting a very disjointed historical narrative with massive

01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:22.640
unexplained time skips that's very loosely based on reality, where he insists that free market

01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:27.520
capitalism is responsible for anything good that's ever happened, while presenting nothing but a few

01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:33.520
misleading graphs or just outright lying to sustain that narrative. Then at the end, he pulls out

01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:38.240
more misleading graphs, contradicts everything that he just spent seven whole minutes telling you,

01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:43.040
and then insists that the only way forward is to do exactly what the world's worst corporations

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:48.800
tell us to do. It is utterly embarrassing that Johnny Harris frames himself as a journalist

01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:54.320
who according to him does copious amounts of research for his videos, including this one,

01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:58.720
where he gets pretty much everything wrong, provides next to no evidence for his claims,

01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:03.840
and messes up to a comical level when he does actually try to provide a source. And this video

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:09.120
is indicative of the quality of research across his entire channel. It's garbage. But unfortunately,

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:13.760
it seems to work regardless because he gets a whole lot of views. And as the link for this

01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:19.760
response video makes clear, it takes infinitely more effort to refute made up bullshit than the

01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:25.280
effort that goes into making up the bullshit. In conclusion, Johnny Harris is a liar. Worse.

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:31.200
His lies are about as complex as lying to a child that babies are delivered to your doorstep by stalks.

01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:37.200
Way worse. He took money to lie and mislead on behalf of one of the world's most nefarious and

01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:43.040
damaging, ultra-rich advocacy organizations, and even seemed proud of doing so when he was called

01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:47.040
out on it. If there's anything actually useful that you should take from this video beyond that,

01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:52.480
it's one, that neoliberalism actually sucks, and that other forms of capitalism pretty much

01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:58.000
suck too, though quite a bit less, and two, that all of the problems that I've outlined here about

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:03.520
Johnny Harris's content are not actually unique to his content. The vast majority of YouTube

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:09.280
infotainment, particularly historical infotainment, is exactly the same. It's just people who make

01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:13.520
confident-sounding statements that the audience is just supposed to take for granted because

01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:18.800
they said so. It's rare for them to even explain their reasoning, let alone provide anything resembling

01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:24.080
adequate evidence for it. The average YouTube history video is so bad that treating it as

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:28.480
anything more than background noise while you clean the house or something is a huge mistake.

01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:32.480
That's all for now. If you liked this video and want to see more like it, then subscribe
