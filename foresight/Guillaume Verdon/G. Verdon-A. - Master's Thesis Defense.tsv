0	7000	So, Geyom, you have 20, 25 minutes to give your person a question.
7000	8000	Okay.
8000	9000	All right.
9000	13000	So, yeah, I'm going to talk about my thesis today.
13000	17000	It's on probably quantum fields, measurements, and quantum energy teleportation.
17000	19000	Let's go ahead and get started.
19000	20000	All right.
20000	25000	So the relation between information and energy has been of central interest in many subfields
25000	27000	of physics for many years.
27000	32000	The usual context of study are thermodynamics, Maxwell-Thiemann, black holes, area laws,
32000	37000	entropies, cosmologies, and we're working on entropic gravity.
37000	44000	There's holography, theories of emergence, spacetime, ADS-CFT, and today we're rather
44000	47000	going to be focusing on relativistic quantum information.
47000	53000	In relativistic quantum information, one of the main tools is probes.
53000	58000	And we probe the quantum field with a first quantized system, say a qubit or harmonic oscillator,
58000	63000	and that provides a window onto the quantum field's Hilbert space.
63000	68000	And it narrows our focus onto a subsystem in the field because the Hilbert space of the
68000	71000	field is so large, it's kind of unwieldy.
71000	78000	So by focusing on certain subspaces that we couple to with probes, then we could do,
79000	87000	we're more flexible in our analysis of the information-theoretic structure of the fields.
87000	94000	So one caveat is the information that you get from the field depends highly on the type
94000	97000	of probe you use and how you couple.
97000	106000	So today we're going to try to create unobstrucive views using qubits, qubits oscillators,
106000	111000	so that we have a clear window onto the Hilbert space of the quantum field,
111000	117000	and we could do more powerful things than is usual in RQI.
117000	120000	So an overview of what we're going to cover today, and there's a lot of content,
120000	123000	just follow my voice to get lost.
123000	126000	Okay, so we're going to start with different types of probes.
126000	130000	We're going to see there's, you can do analog, quantum analog, quantum digital,
130000	133000	using qubits, qubits, harmonic oscillators,
133000	138000	and then there's a question of which is exactly the subspace of the field we are probing
138000	142000	when we couple via some local smearing to the field,
142000	147000	and we're going to build the Hilbert space, the quantum field, out of a bunch of smeared observables,
147000	150000	and then we're going to express the Hamiltonian in terms of these observables,
150000	153000	and that's going to be very useful for many calculations.
153000	158000	And then we're going to apply these tools and see what we get used them for,
158000	162000	such as measuring the state on a certain subspace of the field,
162000	168000	intangible harvesting, and quantum energy teleportation glass, but not least.
168000	174000	Okay, so canonically in RQI, the typical interaction we use is between a qubit and the field.
174000	177000	It's point-like in space and spread out in time,
177000	181000	but there's a certain time dependency in our coupling,
181000	186000	and because we're temporarily smearing the interaction we have,
186000	189000	we need to perform a time-ordered exponential,
189000	193000	and basically we have to do a perturbative expansion.
193000	198000	And essentially, this is a picture of the coupling it possesses in time,
198000	205000	so the imprint it gathers from the field is kind of as much, so that's not ideal,
205000	212000	and we're going to do theoretical simplifications that are somewhat physically less accurate,
212000	215000	but theoretically they're more practical.
215000	219000	So we're going to use spatially smeared interactions temporarily instantaneous,
219000	221000	and that kills off our time ordering,
221000	225000	and we can do fully non-perturbed interactions and unitaries,
225000	228000	and we're going to do some powerful stuff with that.
228000	235000	Okay, so we effectively coupled a single quantum harmonic oscillator subsystem of the field,
235000	237000	and it's this certain quadrature.
237000	242000	This is a smeared-out field operator smeared with respect to a certain distribution,
242000	246000	we're going to assume they're of compact support very often.
246000	250000	So we could choose what to probe this subspace with,
250000	255000	either a qubit and qubits, which form a qu-dit,
255000	259000	which is like an exponentially large atom, or harmonic oscillators,
259000	262000	which is my personal favorite in this thesis.
262000	267000	So we're going to explore the differences between using these different probes,
267000	270000	first in the context of a measurement protocol,
270000	275000	and we're going to build some jargon that we're going to use later.
275000	279000	Okay, so for a continuous variable measurement, what I want to do,
279000	284000	let's say I want to measure a harmonic oscillator A using a control system C.
284000	288000	I can start my control system in a very narrow, sharp, squeezed state,
288000	295000	and then I can do a controlled displacement, depending on the value of the quadrature of A.
295000	300000	I displace by a scalar multiple of that amount my control register.
300000	305000	And essentially, because we're a very sharp pointer variable,
305000	312000	if I were to project the control register, I get a near-projective POVM, if you know what that means.
312000	316000	And very often we're actually going to skip the projective measurements
316000	322000	and just keep everything coherent, because it's easier with the formalism and its equivalent.
322000	328000	Okay, so every time I use, so sorry, this is an adder gate,
328000	336000	and you add the field, you displace one depending on the value of the other's quadrature.
336000	338000	So we're going to use this very often.
338000	345000	So the analog to digital kind of conversion, the similar kind of gate, is the following.
345000	348000	And this is a very classic algorithm in quantum computing.
348000	350000	It's called the phase estimation algorithm.
350000	354000	So basically we want an adder, but now our control system is made of a bunch of qubits.
354000	359000	So we want our readouts to be a binary kind of readout.
359000	365000	And basically the trick is we start with spin-ups, and then we create, we do a Fourier transform,
365000	369000	which if we consider the virtual qubit that these guys form,
369000	373000	is this state after the Fourier transform is a uniform superposition.
373000	380000	And let's say we expand our target state in eigenstates of the observable we're trying to measure.
380000	384000	Then if you act a certain exponential of an operator out in eigenstate, it becomes a phase.
384000	388000	And the phase, as we all know, kicks through tensor products.
388000	390000	So we call this a kickback.
390000	397000	And so because these are controlled unitaries, they depend on the state of which superposition in here.
397000	401000	Then each different superposition will pick up a different phase.
401000	406000	And then when we inverse Fourier transform, these relative phases get converted
406000	409000	into actually the standard basis 0s and 1s.
409000	415000	So essentially this is like a shift operator, but it shifts the binary value.
415000	418000	It gives us an approximate value, binary readout.
418000	424000	And you could use a lot more qubits, and it converges to a new project of measurement,
424000	427000	like the squeeze state implemented a very large squeeze.
427000	432000	And what's really neat is that we actually use single qubit to oscillator interactions
432000	436000	and pre- and post-processing to form a qubit.
436000	443000	And these are kind of like on a riddle with their sigma z couple to field.
443000	448000	So very often I'm going to use the harmonic oscillator version,
448000	454000	because it's the simplest and the cleanest, but keep in mind that we can always emulate
454000	459000	the harmonic oscillator with a bunch of qubits this way with the Fourier transform.
459000	465000	Okay, so a couple, a bunch of probes, we start with this smeared observable.
465000	469000	So what subspace of the field are we helping do?
469000	476000	Usually we factorize the Hilbert space, factorize, but using a maximum communing set of observables
476000	480000	to field at every point, for example, that's a very typical cartoon we use,
480000	484000	is a bunch of coupled harmonic oscillators being in the quantum field.
484000	488000	And we have a canonical commutation relation, we have phi and phi at every point,
488000	496000	and out of these operators we construct, you know, every other observable.
496000	500000	Okay, so now we would like to, instead of writing a spatially composition,
500000	502000	write it in terms of smeared observables.
502000	507000	So for each phi we can build a pi, which is just a smeared pi with a normalization,
507000	510000	and we obey the canonical commutation relation,
510000	515000	and suppose we have an orthogonal basis for the L squared integral functions,
515000	520000	then we can build out of this basis a maximally commuted set of observables,
520000	524000	and we get a harmonic oscillator for every basis element,
524000	529000	and the Hilbert space factorizes into the Hilbert space of the subspace of each smearing.
529000	534000	And often we're going to just have a bunch of disjoint compactly supported smearing,
534000	538000	and then we're going to assume there exists a basis completion in some sense.
538000	541000	But we don't need to work with these directly,
541000	543000	it's just kind of abstract formalism,
543000	548000	but it's very practical and shortens calculation like tenfold.
548000	552000	Okay, so what's useful about this is that we could rewrite the Hamiltonian.
552000	556000	Usually we write the Hamiltonian like this, we have the derivative coupling,
556000	559000	if you expand the derivative as a finite difference approximation,
559000	563000	then you get a nearest neighbor like quadratic coupling.
563000	567000	Usually we decouple, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian,
567000	569000	we take Fourier transform, right?
569000	573000	And so the Fourier transform is like the kind of the eigenbasis of the,
573000	577000	it's like the meto eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian.
577000	581000	So in terms of smearing observables, it's not diagonal, it's more like the space,
581000	586000	but we have something like this, and we have a quadratic coupling here,
586000	590000	and if we assume that our basis is made of compactly supported functions,
590000	592000	then the derivatives are also compactly supported,
592000	596000	and these guys only couple to a handful of other guys,
596000	599000	maybe uncountable, whatever.
599000	605000	And so it's like a virtual lattice, just like this is a lattice of harmonic oscillators.
605000	609000	So we could use this to pour it over some calculations
609000	612000	from actual lattice calculations later on.
612000	617000	Okay, so a quick review of Gramscian states, lightning review.
617000	620000	So Gramscian states of quadratic Hamiltonians are Gaussians,
620000	624000	Gaussian states are fully specified by where they are and how they're squished,
624000	628000	and the phase space grows linearly in the number of oscillators.
628000	633000	So it's really nice, you could do nice detailed calculations of energy
633000	636000	and entropy and whatnot, that's what we use.
636000	640000	And any quadratically generated unitary, like the one we use for the aggregates,
640000	642000	preserves Gaussianity.
642000	645000	So we're going to be working the Gaussian state formalism,
645000	650000	the formalism that allows for our calculations to be very attractive.
650000	656000	Okay, so the ground state of this quadratically coupled Hamiltonian
656000	659000	is Gaussian in terms of the smeared observables.
659000	662000	So that's very practical.
662000	665000	So more or less the central theme of the thesis
665000	669000	is what I call the local versus non-local duality.
669000	674000	So the ground state is unattangled in the Fourier factorization, right,
674000	679000	the Hamiltonian is diagonal, so it's a product state of ground states.
679000	683000	But when you have couplings, you have entanglement across tensor factors.
683000	686000	And that's what we use for entanglement harvesting,
686000	689000	the entanglement between the different smears.
689000	693000	And conversely, if I do a local operation when I, that's compactly supported,
693000	696000	when I take a Fourier transform, it's non-local in Fourier space.
696000	702000	Something that's local in space is non-local in kind of the metaheism basis of energy.
702000	705000	So energetically, local action is non-local.
705000	708000	That's kind of what we use for quantum energy teleportation.
708000	715000	We use both this formalism and Fourier modes for the calculations of the thesis.
715000	720000	Okay, so entanglement harvesting, that's our first application of probing.
720000	722000	We've done a lot of background now.
722000	726000	So the goal of entanglement harvesting is you want to swap entanglement
726000	731000	that's living between these subspaces of the field onto certain probe.
731000	735000	I choose harmonic oscillators because they're the most compatible,
735000	737000	in some sense, and easy to work with.
737000	743000	And I do a continuous variable swap gate because it exists.
743000	747000	And basically, if you know quantum computing, this is extremely familiar.
747000	750000	This is how you build swap gates with usual qubits, qubit adders,
750000	753000	but in this case, it's harmonic oscillator adders.
753000	757000	And essentially, we swap the state locally, here and here,
757000	761000	and whatever entanglement we have between these two subspaces
761000	764000	gets transferred onto the probes.
764000	768000	And you can harvest all the entanglement that was in between these two subspaces
768000	770000	for the ground state or whatever state you really want.
770000	773000	So Gaussian interactions are easily computable,
773000	780000	computing a thesis, and again, you can swap it onto a digital registry if you want it,
780000	783000	and using n-rid with interactions.
783000	788000	Okay, so quantum energy teleportation, a different application.
788000	790000	So this is the basic protocol.
790000	796000	Usually, we use a single qubit, and we couple to a certain subspace.
796000	800000	And basically, we want to harness the correlations between these two subspaces
800000	806000	such that once we measure here, we gain some level of knowledge about the fluctuations over here
806000	808000	because we don't know much about here.
808000	809000	It costs energy.
809000	812000	When we couple, we create fluctuations, we inject energy.
812000	816000	And then when we transfer over the information to Bob,
816000	820000	because we have some knowledge of B, we can suppress these fluctuations.
820000	821000	And what kind of gate do we do?
821000	825000	It's just an adder gate, but we tune the coupling in the right way.
825000	828000	And basically here, I do a fully coherent protocol,
828000	830000	and there's a theorem that says you could do this.
830000	834000	You could skip, instead of measuring the qubit after Alice does her interaction
834000	837000	and sending classical information, you could just send quantum information.
837000	839000	And it's theoretically the same protocol.
839000	843000	So just for formalism, it's easier to stay coherent.
843000	846000	Okay, so this is the calculation I did.
846000	850000	It's the same protocol, but on steroids in some sense.
850000	854000	You have multiple sites where you measure and multiple target sites,
854000	856000	and you use harmonic oscillators.
856000	863000	And we want to use the correlations between every pair of sites between A and B.
863000	865000	And we want to do this in a smart way.
865000	872000	So again, we use adder gates to do a measurement using squeeze states, as we saw.
872000	876000	And then we carry over the information, and then we couple each to each.
876000	878000	And then we suppress the fluctuations.
878000	883000	So it's one to one here and all to all there, but you could split up the interactions.
883000	887000	And here's a circuit representation using our adder gates we mentioned.
887000	891000	And you have a coupling, you have to tune for each, a coupling matrix.
891000	896000	And then the calculations, I found the optimum for energy teleportation.
896000	901000	What you want is to create negative energy density at the target site,
901000	905000	which means you have lowered the energy from the vacuum energy density.
905000	909000	Okay, so we could calculate this using our formalism.
909000	913000	This is one of the cleaner answers I was able to copy from the thesis.
913000	917000	In the limit of very large squeezing, we get the optimal energy,
917000	920000	while this is changing energy, so it's negative, is a correlator,
920000	924000	in the case of the distance, divided by some variance and some norm.
924000	928000	And basically, the self-variance of this is basically Alice.
928000	930000	That's considered as noise.
930000	935000	It's like fluctuations that are not from correlations with Bob.
935000	938000	Okay, so for numerics, we could port over all our formalism
938000	943000	to actually use an actual finite discrete lattice and write it on a computer.
943000	945000	And we could, well, it's not showing very well,
945000	949000	but we could compute entanglement entropies and we have more freedom that way
949000	953000	because we have the power of Gaussian state formalism and numerics.
953000	956000	So here are some plots, there are many more,
956000	961000	but the most basic thing we're to expect is that this is,
961000	964000	you want this to be negative for more energy extraction,
964000	968000	but you extract more energy as the mutual information increases.
968000	970000	Something more surprising is on the right,
970000	974000	is that you actually, when you extract energy at site B,
974000	978000	you increase entanglement entropy of B with its complement.
978000	982000	And that's interesting because a good measurement actually breaks entanglement, right?
982000	985000	If a certain subset is entangled with a bunch of other things
985000	988000	and you perturb it with a probe, then you break the entanglement it had.
988000	990000	And you inject energy by doing so.
990000	993000	But when you extract energy, you actually increase the entanglement.
993000	995000	So there seems to be a nice little relation there,
995000	998000	and there may be some deeper implications.
998000	1001000	Maybe I'll talk about that later.
1001000	1004000	Okay, so other calculations, this is just the laundry list.
1004000	1010000	Measurements, so yeah, for the multi-point measurement,
1010000	1013000	computed energetic cost information, gain, broken entanglement,
1013000	1015000	qubits, qubits, harmonic oscillators,
1015000	1017000	for general multi-point measurement,
1017000	1019000	it's an entanglement harvesting,
1019000	1022000	calculated the energetic cost of swap gates using formalism,
1022000	1025000	it was a clean calculation.
1025000	1027000	Then for quantum energy, the overtation,
1027000	1030000	information gain versus entanglement breaking for the measurements
1030000	1034000	and all the energetics for the multi-point continuous variable case,
1034000	1038000	which we saw, the finite discrete harmonic lattice,
1038000	1043000	which was in collaboration with Jason for that mention, the numerics.
1043000	1047000	And for clock-like qubits, which I didn't mention,
1047000	1049000	but it was a paper with Eddie Onakim.
1049000	1052000	But I don't have time to talk much about that.
1052000	1055000	Yeah, and numerical analysis.
1055000	1059000	Okay, so this is the bonus round.
1059000	1062000	This is some of the cool stuff
1062000	1064000	that I've come up with towards the end of my thesis,
1064000	1067000	but I had time to finish.
1067000	1070000	So the best measurement for quantum energy palpitation
1070000	1072000	is about breaking entanglement.
1072000	1075000	So I wonder how could we break all the entanglement
1075000	1078000	of a certain region with its exterior?
1078000	1082000	Well, in general, if I have a certain entangled pure state,
1082000	1084000	I have a Schmitt decomposition,
1084000	1087000	and say I measured A in the Schmitt basis,
1087000	1091000	then I go from an entangled state and a product here
1091000	1094000	to a GHC entanglement,
1094000	1098000	and that breaks the entanglement between A
1098000	1100000	and its complement completely.
1100000	1104000	Well, it breaks a big chunk.
1104000	1107000	So now let's say we have a spherical region
1107000	1109000	and its causal diamond,
1109000	1112000	and there must exist a Schmitt decomposition
1112000	1115000	for the bipartition between the whole space of this
1115000	1117000	and its complement,
1117000	1120000	and the Schmitt basis is necessarily the eigenbasis
1120000	1122000	of the modular Hamiltonian.
1122000	1124000	If you have something like this, you take a trace,
1124000	1126000	you know, it's going to be a sum like this.
1126000	1128000	The modular Hamiltonian is like the log
1128000	1130000	of the reduced density matrix.
1130000	1133000	So when you do a singular value decomposition theorem
1133000	1135000	for your Schmitt decomposition,
1135000	1138000	it's like optimizing the local Bogoliubov transformations,
1138000	1140000	and in quantum field theory,
1140000	1143000	Bogoliubov transformations are like coordinates
1143000	1146000	and they're a change of basis of modes, right?
1146000	1151000	So I was wondering, can you construct a set of Schmitt basis modes, right?
1151000	1153000	Because when you have a basis for a quantum field,
1153000	1155000	it's a bunch of modes.
1155000	1158000	So working backwards from some recent work by Jacobson,
1158000	1160000	constructed some modes,
1160000	1162000	and this is an example.
1162000	1164000	So usually in the Rindler case,
1164000	1166000	we have a horizon, we have a chirp near the horizon,
1166000	1169000	and then it's red shifts,
1169000	1171000	but since here we have kind of two horizons,
1171000	1173000	I have a double chirp.
1173000	1175000	That's interesting.
1175000	1177000	I have actually some geometric intuition
1177000	1179000	using path integrals and stuff.
1179000	1181000	Maybe somebody could ask me about that later.
1181000	1183000	I have an extra slide.
1183000	1186000	So the next steps are to compute Bogoliubov transformations,
1186000	1188000	Bogoliubov coefficients,
1188000	1190000	and then compute energetics,
1190000	1192000	like when I break all the entanglement,
1192000	1196000	and could I use this for some ultimate QT protocol?
1196000	1199000	What's interesting with these modes
1199000	1202000	is that basically when you optimize over local unitaries,
1202000	1204000	when you find the Schmitt basis,
1204000	1206000	you kind of filter out the self-correlations
1206000	1208000	with an A and with an A bar.
1208000	1211000	You only keep the correlations that cross A and A bar.
1211000	1214000	So when we were sampling a bunch of points,
1214000	1216000	if I sample a bunch of points in this region,
1216000	1219000	if they're neighboring, then they're highly correlated.
1219000	1221000	So my information would be highly redundant.
1221000	1223000	But in this way, if I sample this way,
1223000	1225000	it's kind of diagonal.
1225000	1228000	It's like the Rindler decomposition of the state
1228000	1230000	in terms of random modes.
1230000	1233000	So I get completely uncorrelated information.
1233000	1236000	So instead of having to process the information in QET,
1236000	1239000	we did some optimized over couplings
1239000	1242000	to undo some self-correlations with an A.
1242000	1246000	This just gives you the perfect raw information.
1246000	1248000	Okay.
1248000	1250000	So in conclusion,
1250000	1252000	some key messages.
1252000	1254000	You can collect quantum information,
1254000	1256000	or classical, about a certain observable,
1256000	1260000	about subspaces of the field by some probes.
1260000	1263000	And you can record this information on quantum digital,
1263000	1266000	or quantum analog, and digital analog,
1266000	1269000	kind of in a certain limit there equivalent.
1269000	1273000	You could collect quantum information at multiple locations,
1273000	1279000	and the entanglement of the field gets swapped onto the probes.
1280000	1283000	You could perform an optimal quantum energy
1283000	1285000	interpretation protocol that harnesses
1285000	1287000	multi-point correlations.
1287000	1289000	And in terms of our main theme of energy
1289000	1291000	versus information, we've got something interesting.
1291000	1293000	Measurements seem to cost energy,
1293000	1295000	measurement of the vacuum.
1295000	1297000	We seem to cost energy and break vacuum entanglement.
1297000	1300000	And when we extract energy from the local volume,
1300000	1303000	the vacuum it reinforces the vacuum entanglement.
1303000	1306000	Okay, so that's it.
1306000	1311000	Thank you very much.
