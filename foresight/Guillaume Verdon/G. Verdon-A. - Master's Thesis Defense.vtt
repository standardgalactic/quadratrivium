00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
So, Geyom, you have 20, 25 minutes to give your person a question.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Okay.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
All right.

00:09.000 --> 00:13.000
So, yeah, I'm going to talk about my thesis today.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
It's on probably quantum fields, measurements, and quantum energy teleportation.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
Let's go ahead and get started.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
All right.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
So the relation between information and energy has been of central interest in many subfields

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
of physics for many years.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
The usual context of study are thermodynamics, Maxwell-Thiemann, black holes, area laws,

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
entropies, cosmologies, and we're working on entropic gravity.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
There's holography, theories of emergence, spacetime, ADS-CFT, and today we're rather

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
going to be focusing on relativistic quantum information.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
In relativistic quantum information, one of the main tools is probes.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
And we probe the quantum field with a first quantized system, say a qubit or harmonic oscillator,

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
and that provides a window onto the quantum field's Hilbert space.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.000
And it narrows our focus onto a subsystem in the field because the Hilbert space of the

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
field is so large, it's kind of unwieldy.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
So by focusing on certain subspaces that we couple to with probes, then we could do,

01:19.000 --> 01:27.000
we're more flexible in our analysis of the information-theoretic structure of the fields.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
So one caveat is the information that you get from the field depends highly on the type

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
of probe you use and how you couple.

01:37.000 --> 01:46.000
So today we're going to try to create unobstrucive views using qubits, qubits oscillators,

01:46.000 --> 01:51.000
so that we have a clear window onto the Hilbert space of the quantum field,

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
and we could do more powerful things than is usual in RQI.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
So an overview of what we're going to cover today, and there's a lot of content,

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
just follow my voice to get lost.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
Okay, so we're going to start with different types of probes.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
We're going to see there's, you can do analog, quantum analog, quantum digital,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
using qubits, qubits, harmonic oscillators,

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
and then there's a question of which is exactly the subspace of the field we are probing

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
when we couple via some local smearing to the field,

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
and we're going to build the Hilbert space, the quantum field, out of a bunch of smeared observables,

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
and then we're going to express the Hamiltonian in terms of these observables,

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
and that's going to be very useful for many calculations.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
And then we're going to apply these tools and see what we get used them for,

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
such as measuring the state on a certain subspace of the field,

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
intangible harvesting, and quantum energy teleportation glass, but not least.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Okay, so canonically in RQI, the typical interaction we use is between a qubit and the field.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
It's point-like in space and spread out in time,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
but there's a certain time dependency in our coupling,

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
and because we're temporarily smearing the interaction we have,

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
we need to perform a time-ordered exponential,

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
and basically we have to do a perturbative expansion.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
And essentially, this is a picture of the coupling it possesses in time,

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
so the imprint it gathers from the field is kind of as much, so that's not ideal,

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
and we're going to do theoretical simplifications that are somewhat physically less accurate,

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
but theoretically they're more practical.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
So we're going to use spatially smeared interactions temporarily instantaneous,

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
and that kills off our time ordering,

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
and we can do fully non-perturbed interactions and unitaries,

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
and we're going to do some powerful stuff with that.

03:48.000 --> 03:55.000
Okay, so we effectively coupled a single quantum harmonic oscillator subsystem of the field,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
and it's this certain quadrature.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
This is a smeared-out field operator smeared with respect to a certain distribution,

04:02.000 --> 04:06.000
we're going to assume they're of compact support very often.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
So we could choose what to probe this subspace with,

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
either a qubit and qubits, which form a qu-dit,

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
which is like an exponentially large atom, or harmonic oscillators,

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
which is my personal favorite in this thesis.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
So we're going to explore the differences between using these different probes,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
first in the context of a measurement protocol,

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
and we're going to build some jargon that we're going to use later.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
Okay, so for a continuous variable measurement, what I want to do,

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
let's say I want to measure a harmonic oscillator A using a control system C.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
I can start my control system in a very narrow, sharp, squeezed state,

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
and then I can do a controlled displacement, depending on the value of the quadrature of A.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
I displace by a scalar multiple of that amount my control register.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
And essentially, because we're a very sharp pointer variable,

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
if I were to project the control register, I get a near-projective POVM, if you know what that means.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
And very often we're actually going to skip the projective measurements

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
and just keep everything coherent, because it's easier with the formalism and its equivalent.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.000
Okay, so every time I use, so sorry, this is an adder gate,

05:28.000 --> 05:36.000
and you add the field, you displace one depending on the value of the other's quadrature.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
So we're going to use this very often.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
So the analog to digital kind of conversion, the similar kind of gate, is the following.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
And this is a very classic algorithm in quantum computing.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
It's called the phase estimation algorithm.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
So basically we want an adder, but now our control system is made of a bunch of qubits.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
So we want our readouts to be a binary kind of readout.

05:59.000 --> 06:05.000
And basically the trick is we start with spin-ups, and then we create, we do a Fourier transform,

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
which if we consider the virtual qubit that these guys form,

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
is this state after the Fourier transform is a uniform superposition.

06:13.000 --> 06:20.000
And let's say we expand our target state in eigenstates of the observable we're trying to measure.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
Then if you act a certain exponential of an operator out in eigenstate, it becomes a phase.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.000
And the phase, as we all know, kicks through tensor products.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
So we call this a kickback.

06:30.000 --> 06:37.000
And so because these are controlled unitaries, they depend on the state of which superposition in here.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
Then each different superposition will pick up a different phase.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
And then when we inverse Fourier transform, these relative phases get converted

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
into actually the standard basis 0s and 1s.

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
So essentially this is like a shift operator, but it shifts the binary value.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
It gives us an approximate value, binary readout.

06:58.000 --> 07:04.000
And you could use a lot more qubits, and it converges to a new project of measurement,

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
like the squeeze state implemented a very large squeeze.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.000
And what's really neat is that we actually use single qubit to oscillator interactions

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
and pre- and post-processing to form a qubit.

07:16.000 --> 07:23.000
And these are kind of like on a riddle with their sigma z couple to field.

07:23.000 --> 07:28.000
So very often I'm going to use the harmonic oscillator version,

07:28.000 --> 07:34.000
because it's the simplest and the cleanest, but keep in mind that we can always emulate

07:34.000 --> 07:39.000
the harmonic oscillator with a bunch of qubits this way with the Fourier transform.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
Okay, so a couple, a bunch of probes, we start with this smeared observable.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
So what subspace of the field are we helping do?

07:49.000 --> 07:56.000
Usually we factorize the Hilbert space, factorize, but using a maximum communing set of observables

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
to field at every point, for example, that's a very typical cartoon we use,

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
is a bunch of coupled harmonic oscillators being in the quantum field.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
And we have a canonical commutation relation, we have phi and phi at every point,

08:08.000 --> 08:16.000
and out of these operators we construct, you know, every other observable.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
Okay, so now we would like to, instead of writing a spatially composition,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
write it in terms of smeared observables.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.000
So for each phi we can build a pi, which is just a smeared pi with a normalization,

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
and we obey the canonical commutation relation,

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
and suppose we have an orthogonal basis for the L squared integral functions,

08:35.000 --> 08:40.000
then we can build out of this basis a maximally commuted set of observables,

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
and we get a harmonic oscillator for every basis element,

08:44.000 --> 08:49.000
and the Hilbert space factorizes into the Hilbert space of the subspace of each smearing.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
And often we're going to just have a bunch of disjoint compactly supported smearing,

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
and then we're going to assume there exists a basis completion in some sense.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
But we don't need to work with these directly,

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
it's just kind of abstract formalism,

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
but it's very practical and shortens calculation like tenfold.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
Okay, so what's useful about this is that we could rewrite the Hamiltonian.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
Usually we write the Hamiltonian like this, we have the derivative coupling,

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
if you expand the derivative as a finite difference approximation,

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
then you get a nearest neighbor like quadratic coupling.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
Usually we decouple, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian,

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
we take Fourier transform, right?

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
And so the Fourier transform is like the kind of the eigenbasis of the,

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
it's like the meto eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
So in terms of smearing observables, it's not diagonal, it's more like the space,

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
but we have something like this, and we have a quadratic coupling here,

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
and if we assume that our basis is made of compactly supported functions,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
then the derivatives are also compactly supported,

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
and these guys only couple to a handful of other guys,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.000
maybe uncountable, whatever.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
And so it's like a virtual lattice, just like this is a lattice of harmonic oscillators.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
So we could use this to pour it over some calculations

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
from actual lattice calculations later on.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
Okay, so a quick review of Gramscian states, lightning review.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
So Gramscian states of quadratic Hamiltonians are Gaussians,

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Gaussian states are fully specified by where they are and how they're squished,

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
and the phase space grows linearly in the number of oscillators.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
So it's really nice, you could do nice detailed calculations of energy

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
and entropy and whatnot, that's what we use.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
And any quadratically generated unitary, like the one we use for the aggregates,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
preserves Gaussianity.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
So we're going to be working the Gaussian state formalism,

10:45.000 --> 10:50.000
the formalism that allows for our calculations to be very attractive.

10:50.000 --> 10:56.000
Okay, so the ground state of this quadratically coupled Hamiltonian

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
is Gaussian in terms of the smeared observables.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
So that's very practical.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
So more or less the central theme of the thesis

11:05.000 --> 11:09.000
is what I call the local versus non-local duality.

11:09.000 --> 11:14.000
So the ground state is unattangled in the Fourier factorization, right,

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
the Hamiltonian is diagonal, so it's a product state of ground states.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
But when you have couplings, you have entanglement across tensor factors.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
And that's what we use for entanglement harvesting,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
the entanglement between the different smears.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
And conversely, if I do a local operation when I, that's compactly supported,

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
when I take a Fourier transform, it's non-local in Fourier space.

11:36.000 --> 11:42.000
Something that's local in space is non-local in kind of the metaheism basis of energy.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
So energetically, local action is non-local.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
That's kind of what we use for quantum energy teleportation.

11:48.000 --> 11:55.000
We use both this formalism and Fourier modes for the calculations of the thesis.

11:55.000 --> 12:00.000
Okay, so entanglement harvesting, that's our first application of probing.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
We've done a lot of background now.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
So the goal of entanglement harvesting is you want to swap entanglement

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
that's living between these subspaces of the field onto certain probe.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
I choose harmonic oscillators because they're the most compatible,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
in some sense, and easy to work with.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
And I do a continuous variable swap gate because it exists.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
And basically, if you know quantum computing, this is extremely familiar.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
This is how you build swap gates with usual qubits, qubit adders,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
but in this case, it's harmonic oscillator adders.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
And essentially, we swap the state locally, here and here,

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
and whatever entanglement we have between these two subspaces

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
gets transferred onto the probes.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.000
And you can harvest all the entanglement that was in between these two subspaces

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
for the ground state or whatever state you really want.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
So Gaussian interactions are easily computable,

12:53.000 --> 13:00.000
computing a thesis, and again, you can swap it onto a digital registry if you want it,

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
and using n-rid with interactions.

13:03.000 --> 13:08.000
Okay, so quantum energy teleportation, a different application.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
So this is the basic protocol.

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
Usually, we use a single qubit, and we couple to a certain subspace.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
And basically, we want to harness the correlations between these two subspaces

13:20.000 --> 13:26.000
such that once we measure here, we gain some level of knowledge about the fluctuations over here

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
because we don't know much about here.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
It costs energy.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
When we couple, we create fluctuations, we inject energy.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
And then when we transfer over the information to Bob,

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
because we have some knowledge of B, we can suppress these fluctuations.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
And what kind of gate do we do?

13:41.000 --> 13:45.000
It's just an adder gate, but we tune the coupling in the right way.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
And basically here, I do a fully coherent protocol,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
and there's a theorem that says you could do this.

13:50.000 --> 13:54.000
You could skip, instead of measuring the qubit after Alice does her interaction

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
and sending classical information, you could just send quantum information.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
And it's theoretically the same protocol.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
So just for formalism, it's easier to stay coherent.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
Okay, so this is the calculation I did.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
It's the same protocol, but on steroids in some sense.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
You have multiple sites where you measure and multiple target sites,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
and you use harmonic oscillators.

14:16.000 --> 14:23.000
And we want to use the correlations between every pair of sites between A and B.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
And we want to do this in a smart way.

14:25.000 --> 14:32.000
So again, we use adder gates to do a measurement using squeeze states, as we saw.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
And then we carry over the information, and then we couple each to each.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
And then we suppress the fluctuations.

14:38.000 --> 14:43.000
So it's one to one here and all to all there, but you could split up the interactions.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
And here's a circuit representation using our adder gates we mentioned.

14:47.000 --> 14:51.000
And you have a coupling, you have to tune for each, a coupling matrix.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
And then the calculations, I found the optimum for energy teleportation.

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
What you want is to create negative energy density at the target site,

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
which means you have lowered the energy from the vacuum energy density.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.000
Okay, so we could calculate this using our formalism.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.000
This is one of the cleaner answers I was able to copy from the thesis.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
In the limit of very large squeezing, we get the optimal energy,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
while this is changing energy, so it's negative, is a correlator,

15:20.000 --> 15:24.000
in the case of the distance, divided by some variance and some norm.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
And basically, the self-variance of this is basically Alice.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
That's considered as noise.

15:30.000 --> 15:35.000
It's like fluctuations that are not from correlations with Bob.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
Okay, so for numerics, we could port over all our formalism

15:38.000 --> 15:43.000
to actually use an actual finite discrete lattice and write it on a computer.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
And we could, well, it's not showing very well,

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
but we could compute entanglement entropies and we have more freedom that way

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
because we have the power of Gaussian state formalism and numerics.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.000
So here are some plots, there are many more,

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
but the most basic thing we're to expect is that this is,

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
you want this to be negative for more energy extraction,

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
but you extract more energy as the mutual information increases.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Something more surprising is on the right,

16:10.000 --> 16:14.000
is that you actually, when you extract energy at site B,

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
you increase entanglement entropy of B with its complement.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
And that's interesting because a good measurement actually breaks entanglement, right?

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
If a certain subset is entangled with a bunch of other things

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
and you perturb it with a probe, then you break the entanglement it had.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
And you inject energy by doing so.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
But when you extract energy, you actually increase the entanglement.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
So there seems to be a nice little relation there,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
and there may be some deeper implications.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Maybe I'll talk about that later.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Okay, so other calculations, this is just the laundry list.

16:44.000 --> 16:50.000
Measurements, so yeah, for the multi-point measurement,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
computed energetic cost information, gain, broken entanglement,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
qubits, qubits, harmonic oscillators,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
for general multi-point measurement,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
it's an entanglement harvesting,

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
calculated the energetic cost of swap gates using formalism,

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
it was a clean calculation.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Then for quantum energy, the overtation,

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
information gain versus entanglement breaking for the measurements

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
and all the energetics for the multi-point continuous variable case,

17:14.000 --> 17:18.000
which we saw, the finite discrete harmonic lattice,

17:18.000 --> 17:23.000
which was in collaboration with Jason for that mention, the numerics.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
And for clock-like qubits, which I didn't mention,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
but it was a paper with Eddie Onakim.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
But I don't have time to talk much about that.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.000
Yeah, and numerical analysis.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.000
Okay, so this is the bonus round.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
This is some of the cool stuff

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
that I've come up with towards the end of my thesis,

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
but I had time to finish.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
So the best measurement for quantum energy palpitation

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
is about breaking entanglement.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
So I wonder how could we break all the entanglement

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
of a certain region with its exterior?

17:58.000 --> 18:02.000
Well, in general, if I have a certain entangled pure state,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
I have a Schmitt decomposition,

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
and say I measured A in the Schmitt basis,

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
then I go from an entangled state and a product here

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
to a GHC entanglement,

18:14.000 --> 18:18.000
and that breaks the entanglement between A

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
and its complement completely.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
Well, it breaks a big chunk.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
So now let's say we have a spherical region

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
and its causal diamond,

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
and there must exist a Schmitt decomposition

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
for the bipartition between the whole space of this

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
and its complement,

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
and the Schmitt basis is necessarily the eigenbasis

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
of the modular Hamiltonian.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
If you have something like this, you take a trace,

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
you know, it's going to be a sum like this.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
The modular Hamiltonian is like the log

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
of the reduced density matrix.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
So when you do a singular value decomposition theorem

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
for your Schmitt decomposition,

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
it's like optimizing the local Bogoliubov transformations,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
and in quantum field theory,

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
Bogoliubov transformations are like coordinates

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
and they're a change of basis of modes, right?

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
So I was wondering, can you construct a set of Schmitt basis modes, right?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
Because when you have a basis for a quantum field,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
it's a bunch of modes.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
So working backwards from some recent work by Jacobson,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
constructed some modes,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
and this is an example.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
So usually in the Rindler case,

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
we have a horizon, we have a chirp near the horizon,

19:26.000 --> 19:29.000
and then it's red shifts,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
but since here we have kind of two horizons,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
I have a double chirp.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
That's interesting.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
I have actually some geometric intuition

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
using path integrals and stuff.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Maybe somebody could ask me about that later.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I have an extra slide.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
So the next steps are to compute Bogoliubov transformations,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
Bogoliubov coefficients,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
and then compute energetics,

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
like when I break all the entanglement,

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
and could I use this for some ultimate QT protocol?

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
What's interesting with these modes

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
is that basically when you optimize over local unitaries,

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
when you find the Schmitt basis,

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
you kind of filter out the self-correlations

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
with an A and with an A bar.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
You only keep the correlations that cross A and A bar.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
So when we were sampling a bunch of points,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
if I sample a bunch of points in this region,

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
if they're neighboring, then they're highly correlated.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
So my information would be highly redundant.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
But in this way, if I sample this way,

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
it's kind of diagonal.

20:25.000 --> 20:28.000
It's like the Rindler decomposition of the state

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
in terms of random modes.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.000
So I get completely uncorrelated information.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
So instead of having to process the information in QET,

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
we did some optimized over couplings

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
to undo some self-correlations with an A.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
This just gives you the perfect raw information.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Okay.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
So in conclusion,

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
some key messages.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
You can collect quantum information,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
or classical, about a certain observable,

20:56.000 --> 21:00.000
about subspaces of the field by some probes.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
And you can record this information on quantum digital,

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
or quantum analog, and digital analog,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
kind of in a certain limit there equivalent.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
You could collect quantum information at multiple locations,

21:13.000 --> 21:19.000
and the entanglement of the field gets swapped onto the probes.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
You could perform an optimal quantum energy

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
interpretation protocol that harnesses

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
multi-point correlations.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
And in terms of our main theme of energy

21:29.000 --> 21:31.000
versus information, we've got something interesting.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Measurements seem to cost energy,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
measurement of the vacuum.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
We seem to cost energy and break vacuum entanglement.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
And when we extract energy from the local volume,

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
the vacuum it reinforces the vacuum entanglement.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
Okay, so that's it.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
Thank you very much.
