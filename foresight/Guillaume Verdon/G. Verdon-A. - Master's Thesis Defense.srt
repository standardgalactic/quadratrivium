1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So, Geyom, you have 20, 25 minutes to give your person a question.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Okay.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
All right.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So, yeah, I'm going to talk about my thesis today.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's on probably quantum fields, measurements, and quantum energy teleportation.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let's go ahead and get started.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
All right.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So the relation between information and energy has been of central interest in many subfields

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
of physics for many years.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The usual context of study are thermodynamics, Maxwell-Thiemann, black holes, area laws,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
entropies, cosmologies, and we're working on entropic gravity.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There's holography, theories of emergence, spacetime, ADS-CFT, and today we're rather

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
going to be focusing on relativistic quantum information.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In relativistic quantum information, one of the main tools is probes.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And we probe the quantum field with a first quantized system, say a qubit or harmonic oscillator,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and that provides a window onto the quantum field's Hilbert space.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And it narrows our focus onto a subsystem in the field because the Hilbert space of the

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
field is so large, it's kind of unwieldy.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So by focusing on certain subspaces that we couple to with probes, then we could do,

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,000
we're more flexible in our analysis of the information-theoretic structure of the fields.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So one caveat is the information that you get from the field depends highly on the type

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
of probe you use and how you couple.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So today we're going to try to create unobstrucive views using qubits, qubits oscillators,

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
so that we have a clear window onto the Hilbert space of the quantum field,

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and we could do more powerful things than is usual in RQI.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
So an overview of what we're going to cover today, and there's a lot of content,

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
just follow my voice to get lost.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay, so we're going to start with different types of probes.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We're going to see there's, you can do analog, quantum analog, quantum digital,

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
using qubits, qubits, harmonic oscillators,

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
and then there's a question of which is exactly the subspace of the field we are probing

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
when we couple via some local smearing to the field,

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and we're going to build the Hilbert space, the quantum field, out of a bunch of smeared observables,

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and then we're going to express the Hamiltonian in terms of these observables,

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and that's going to be very useful for many calculations.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And then we're going to apply these tools and see what we get used them for,

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
such as measuring the state on a certain subspace of the field,

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
intangible harvesting, and quantum energy teleportation glass, but not least.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, so canonically in RQI, the typical interaction we use is between a qubit and the field.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's point-like in space and spread out in time,

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
but there's a certain time dependency in our coupling,

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and because we're temporarily smearing the interaction we have,

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
we need to perform a time-ordered exponential,

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and basically we have to do a perturbative expansion.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And essentially, this is a picture of the coupling it possesses in time,

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
so the imprint it gathers from the field is kind of as much, so that's not ideal,

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and we're going to do theoretical simplifications that are somewhat physically less accurate,

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
but theoretically they're more practical.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So we're going to use spatially smeared interactions temporarily instantaneous,

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
and that kills off our time ordering,

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and we can do fully non-perturbed interactions and unitaries,

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and we're going to do some powerful stuff with that.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay, so we effectively coupled a single quantum harmonic oscillator subsystem of the field,

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
and it's this certain quadrature.

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is a smeared-out field operator smeared with respect to a certain distribution,

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
we're going to assume they're of compact support very often.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So we could choose what to probe this subspace with,

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
either a qubit and qubits, which form a qu-dit,

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
which is like an exponentially large atom, or harmonic oscillators,

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
which is my personal favorite in this thesis.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So we're going to explore the differences between using these different probes,

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
first in the context of a measurement protocol,

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and we're going to build some jargon that we're going to use later.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay, so for a continuous variable measurement, what I want to do,

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
let's say I want to measure a harmonic oscillator A using a control system C.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I can start my control system in a very narrow, sharp, squeezed state,

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and then I can do a controlled displacement, depending on the value of the quadrature of A.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I displace by a scalar multiple of that amount my control register.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And essentially, because we're a very sharp pointer variable,

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
if I were to project the control register, I get a near-projective POVM, if you know what that means.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And very often we're actually going to skip the projective measurements

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and just keep everything coherent, because it's easier with the formalism and its equivalent.

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay, so every time I use, so sorry, this is an adder gate,

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
and you add the field, you displace one depending on the value of the other's quadrature.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So we're going to use this very often.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So the analog to digital kind of conversion, the similar kind of gate, is the following.

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And this is a very classic algorithm in quantum computing.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's called the phase estimation algorithm.

79
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So basically we want an adder, but now our control system is made of a bunch of qubits.

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
So we want our readouts to be a binary kind of readout.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And basically the trick is we start with spin-ups, and then we create, we do a Fourier transform,

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
which if we consider the virtual qubit that these guys form,

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
is this state after the Fourier transform is a uniform superposition.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And let's say we expand our target state in eigenstates of the observable we're trying to measure.

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Then if you act a certain exponential of an operator out in eigenstate, it becomes a phase.

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And the phase, as we all know, kicks through tensor products.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So we call this a kickback.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And so because these are controlled unitaries, they depend on the state of which superposition in here.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Then each different superposition will pick up a different phase.

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And then when we inverse Fourier transform, these relative phases get converted

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
into actually the standard basis 0s and 1s.

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So essentially this is like a shift operator, but it shifts the binary value.

93
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It gives us an approximate value, binary readout.

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And you could use a lot more qubits, and it converges to a new project of measurement,

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
like the squeeze state implemented a very large squeeze.

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And what's really neat is that we actually use single qubit to oscillator interactions

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and pre- and post-processing to form a qubit.

98
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And these are kind of like on a riddle with their sigma z couple to field.

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
So very often I'm going to use the harmonic oscillator version,

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
because it's the simplest and the cleanest, but keep in mind that we can always emulate

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the harmonic oscillator with a bunch of qubits this way with the Fourier transform.

102
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay, so a couple, a bunch of probes, we start with this smeared observable.

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So what subspace of the field are we helping do?

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Usually we factorize the Hilbert space, factorize, but using a maximum communing set of observables

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
to field at every point, for example, that's a very typical cartoon we use,

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
is a bunch of coupled harmonic oscillators being in the quantum field.

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And we have a canonical commutation relation, we have phi and phi at every point,

108
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and out of these operators we construct, you know, every other observable.

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay, so now we would like to, instead of writing a spatially composition,

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
write it in terms of smeared observables.

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So for each phi we can build a pi, which is just a smeared pi with a normalization,

112
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and we obey the canonical commutation relation,

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and suppose we have an orthogonal basis for the L squared integral functions,

114
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
then we can build out of this basis a maximally commuted set of observables,

115
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and we get a harmonic oscillator for every basis element,

116
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
and the Hilbert space factorizes into the Hilbert space of the subspace of each smearing.

117
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And often we're going to just have a bunch of disjoint compactly supported smearing,

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and then we're going to assume there exists a basis completion in some sense.

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But we don't need to work with these directly,

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
it's just kind of abstract formalism,

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
but it's very practical and shortens calculation like tenfold.

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay, so what's useful about this is that we could rewrite the Hamiltonian.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Usually we write the Hamiltonian like this, we have the derivative coupling,

124
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
if you expand the derivative as a finite difference approximation,

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
then you get a nearest neighbor like quadratic coupling.

126
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Usually we decouple, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian,

127
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
we take Fourier transform, right?

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And so the Fourier transform is like the kind of the eigenbasis of the,

129
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
it's like the meto eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian.

130
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So in terms of smearing observables, it's not diagonal, it's more like the space,

131
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
but we have something like this, and we have a quadratic coupling here,

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and if we assume that our basis is made of compactly supported functions,

133
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
then the derivatives are also compactly supported,

134
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
and these guys only couple to a handful of other guys,

135
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
maybe uncountable, whatever.

136
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And so it's like a virtual lattice, just like this is a lattice of harmonic oscillators.

137
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So we could use this to pour it over some calculations

138
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
from actual lattice calculations later on.

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Okay, so a quick review of Gramscian states, lightning review.

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
So Gramscian states of quadratic Hamiltonians are Gaussians,

141
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Gaussian states are fully specified by where they are and how they're squished,

142
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
and the phase space grows linearly in the number of oscillators.

143
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So it's really nice, you could do nice detailed calculations of energy

144
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
and entropy and whatnot, that's what we use.

145
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And any quadratically generated unitary, like the one we use for the aggregates,

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
preserves Gaussianity.

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
So we're going to be working the Gaussian state formalism,

148
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
the formalism that allows for our calculations to be very attractive.

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Okay, so the ground state of this quadratically coupled Hamiltonian

150
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
is Gaussian in terms of the smeared observables.

151
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So that's very practical.

152
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So more or less the central theme of the thesis

153
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
is what I call the local versus non-local duality.

154
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So the ground state is unattangled in the Fourier factorization, right,

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
the Hamiltonian is diagonal, so it's a product state of ground states.

156
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But when you have couplings, you have entanglement across tensor factors.

157
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And that's what we use for entanglement harvesting,

158
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
the entanglement between the different smears.

159
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And conversely, if I do a local operation when I, that's compactly supported,

160
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
when I take a Fourier transform, it's non-local in Fourier space.

161
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Something that's local in space is non-local in kind of the metaheism basis of energy.

162
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So energetically, local action is non-local.

163
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's kind of what we use for quantum energy teleportation.

164
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We use both this formalism and Fourier modes for the calculations of the thesis.

165
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Okay, so entanglement harvesting, that's our first application of probing.

166
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We've done a lot of background now.

167
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So the goal of entanglement harvesting is you want to swap entanglement

168
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
that's living between these subspaces of the field onto certain probe.

169
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I choose harmonic oscillators because they're the most compatible,

170
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
in some sense, and easy to work with.

171
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And I do a continuous variable swap gate because it exists.

172
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And basically, if you know quantum computing, this is extremely familiar.

173
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This is how you build swap gates with usual qubits, qubit adders,

174
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
but in this case, it's harmonic oscillator adders.

175
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
And essentially, we swap the state locally, here and here,

176
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and whatever entanglement we have between these two subspaces

177
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
gets transferred onto the probes.

178
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And you can harvest all the entanglement that was in between these two subspaces

179
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
for the ground state or whatever state you really want.

180
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
So Gaussian interactions are easily computable,

181
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,000
computing a thesis, and again, you can swap it onto a digital registry if you want it,

182
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and using n-rid with interactions.

183
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Okay, so quantum energy teleportation, a different application.

184
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So this is the basic protocol.

185
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Usually, we use a single qubit, and we couple to a certain subspace.

186
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
And basically, we want to harness the correlations between these two subspaces

187
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
such that once we measure here, we gain some level of knowledge about the fluctuations over here

188
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
because we don't know much about here.

189
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It costs energy.

190
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
When we couple, we create fluctuations, we inject energy.

191
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And then when we transfer over the information to Bob,

192
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
because we have some knowledge of B, we can suppress these fluctuations.

193
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And what kind of gate do we do?

194
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's just an adder gate, but we tune the coupling in the right way.

195
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And basically here, I do a fully coherent protocol,

196
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and there's a theorem that says you could do this.

197
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You could skip, instead of measuring the qubit after Alice does her interaction

198
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
and sending classical information, you could just send quantum information.

199
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And it's theoretically the same protocol.

200
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So just for formalism, it's easier to stay coherent.

201
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Okay, so this is the calculation I did.

202
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's the same protocol, but on steroids in some sense.

203
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You have multiple sites where you measure and multiple target sites,

204
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
and you use harmonic oscillators.

205
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And we want to use the correlations between every pair of sites between A and B.

206
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And we want to do this in a smart way.

207
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So again, we use adder gates to do a measurement using squeeze states, as we saw.

208
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And then we carry over the information, and then we couple each to each.

209
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And then we suppress the fluctuations.

210
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
So it's one to one here and all to all there, but you could split up the interactions.

211
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And here's a circuit representation using our adder gates we mentioned.

212
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And you have a coupling, you have to tune for each, a coupling matrix.

213
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And then the calculations, I found the optimum for energy teleportation.

214
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What you want is to create negative energy density at the target site,

215
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
which means you have lowered the energy from the vacuum energy density.

216
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Okay, so we could calculate this using our formalism.

217
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is one of the cleaner answers I was able to copy from the thesis.

218
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
In the limit of very large squeezing, we get the optimal energy,

219
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
while this is changing energy, so it's negative, is a correlator,

220
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
in the case of the distance, divided by some variance and some norm.

221
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And basically, the self-variance of this is basically Alice.

222
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's considered as noise.

223
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's like fluctuations that are not from correlations with Bob.

224
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay, so for numerics, we could port over all our formalism

225
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
to actually use an actual finite discrete lattice and write it on a computer.

226
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And we could, well, it's not showing very well,

227
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
but we could compute entanglement entropies and we have more freedom that way

228
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
because we have the power of Gaussian state formalism and numerics.

229
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So here are some plots, there are many more,

230
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
but the most basic thing we're to expect is that this is,

231
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
you want this to be negative for more energy extraction,

232
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
but you extract more energy as the mutual information increases.

233
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Something more surprising is on the right,

234
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
is that you actually, when you extract energy at site B,

235
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
you increase entanglement entropy of B with its complement.

236
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And that's interesting because a good measurement actually breaks entanglement, right?

237
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
If a certain subset is entangled with a bunch of other things

238
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
and you perturb it with a probe, then you break the entanglement it had.

239
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And you inject energy by doing so.

240
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But when you extract energy, you actually increase the entanglement.

241
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So there seems to be a nice little relation there,

242
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
and there may be some deeper implications.

243
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Maybe I'll talk about that later.

244
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Okay, so other calculations, this is just the laundry list.

245
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Measurements, so yeah, for the multi-point measurement,

246
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
computed energetic cost information, gain, broken entanglement,

247
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
qubits, qubits, harmonic oscillators,

248
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
for general multi-point measurement,

249
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
it's an entanglement harvesting,

250
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
calculated the energetic cost of swap gates using formalism,

251
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
it was a clean calculation.

252
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Then for quantum energy, the overtation,

253
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
information gain versus entanglement breaking for the measurements

254
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and all the energetics for the multi-point continuous variable case,

255
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
which we saw, the finite discrete harmonic lattice,

256
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
which was in collaboration with Jason for that mention, the numerics.

257
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And for clock-like qubits, which I didn't mention,

258
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
but it was a paper with Eddie Onakim.

259
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But I don't have time to talk much about that.

260
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yeah, and numerical analysis.

261
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Okay, so this is the bonus round.

262
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
This is some of the cool stuff

263
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
that I've come up with towards the end of my thesis,

264
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
but I had time to finish.

265
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So the best measurement for quantum energy palpitation

266
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
is about breaking entanglement.

267
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
So I wonder how could we break all the entanglement

268
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
of a certain region with its exterior?

269
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Well, in general, if I have a certain entangled pure state,

270
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I have a Schmitt decomposition,

271
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and say I measured A in the Schmitt basis,

272
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
then I go from an entangled state and a product here

273
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
to a GHC entanglement,

274
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and that breaks the entanglement between A

275
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
and its complement completely.

276
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, it breaks a big chunk.

277
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So now let's say we have a spherical region

278
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
and its causal diamond,

279
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and there must exist a Schmitt decomposition

280
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
for the bipartition between the whole space of this

281
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
and its complement,

282
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and the Schmitt basis is necessarily the eigenbasis

283
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
of the modular Hamiltonian.

284
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If you have something like this, you take a trace,

285
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
you know, it's going to be a sum like this.

286
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The modular Hamiltonian is like the log

287
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
of the reduced density matrix.

288
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So when you do a singular value decomposition theorem

289
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
for your Schmitt decomposition,

290
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
it's like optimizing the local Bogoliubov transformations,

291
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and in quantum field theory,

292
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Bogoliubov transformations are like coordinates

293
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
and they're a change of basis of modes, right?

294
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So I was wondering, can you construct a set of Schmitt basis modes, right?

295
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Because when you have a basis for a quantum field,

296
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
it's a bunch of modes.

297
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
So working backwards from some recent work by Jacobson,

298
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
constructed some modes,

299
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
and this is an example.

300
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So usually in the Rindler case,

301
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
we have a horizon, we have a chirp near the horizon,

302
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
and then it's red shifts,

303
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
but since here we have kind of two horizons,

304
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I have a double chirp.

305
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That's interesting.

306
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I have actually some geometric intuition

307
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
using path integrals and stuff.

308
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Maybe somebody could ask me about that later.

309
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I have an extra slide.

310
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So the next steps are to compute Bogoliubov transformations,

311
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Bogoliubov coefficients,

312
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and then compute energetics,

313
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
like when I break all the entanglement,

314
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
and could I use this for some ultimate QT protocol?

315
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What's interesting with these modes

316
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
is that basically when you optimize over local unitaries,

317
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
when you find the Schmitt basis,

318
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
you kind of filter out the self-correlations

319
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
with an A and with an A bar.

320
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You only keep the correlations that cross A and A bar.

321
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So when we were sampling a bunch of points,

322
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
if I sample a bunch of points in this region,

323
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
if they're neighboring, then they're highly correlated.

324
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So my information would be highly redundant.

325
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But in this way, if I sample this way,

326
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
it's kind of diagonal.

327
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's like the Rindler decomposition of the state

328
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
in terms of random modes.

329
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So I get completely uncorrelated information.

330
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So instead of having to process the information in QET,

331
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
we did some optimized over couplings

332
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
to undo some self-correlations with an A.

333
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This just gives you the perfect raw information.

334
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Okay.

335
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So in conclusion,

336
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
some key messages.

337
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You can collect quantum information,

338
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
or classical, about a certain observable,

339
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
about subspaces of the field by some probes.

340
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And you can record this information on quantum digital,

341
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
or quantum analog, and digital analog,

342
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
kind of in a certain limit there equivalent.

343
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You could collect quantum information at multiple locations,

344
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and the entanglement of the field gets swapped onto the probes.

345
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You could perform an optimal quantum energy

346
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
interpretation protocol that harnesses

347
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
multi-point correlations.

348
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And in terms of our main theme of energy

349
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
versus information, we've got something interesting.

350
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Measurements seem to cost energy,

351
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
measurement of the vacuum.

352
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
We seem to cost energy and break vacuum entanglement.

353
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And when we extract energy from the local volume,

354
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
the vacuum it reinforces the vacuum entanglement.

355
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Okay, so that's it.

356
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Thank you very much.
