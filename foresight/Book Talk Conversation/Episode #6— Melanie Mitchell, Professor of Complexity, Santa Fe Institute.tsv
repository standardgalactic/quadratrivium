0	28000	So, let me start a little bit with the introduction of who Melanie Mitchell is.
28000	36520	She is a Davis Professor of Complexity at Santa Fe Institute, and her research focuses
36520	42360	on conceptual abstraction, analogy making, and visual recognition.
42360	48440	She's done a couple of very popular and well-received books.
48440	54860	The first one was Oxford University Press in 2009, Complexity, a guided tour.
54860	61460	Her most recent book is Artificial Intelligence, a Guide for Thinking Humans, and I have to
61460	68020	say that people who've talked about the Artificial Intelligence book have said some very, very
68020	69980	good things.
69980	78220	For example, we have Allison Gopnik, who says it's very intelligent, clear and sensible
78220	79220	book.
79220	86460	Jeffrey West at Santa Fe has said it's remarkably lucid, comprehensive overview.
86460	93140	Sean Carroll, an astonishing intelligence, and John Paulus, who's been on the show,
93140	99620	says that Mitchell sketches enough details and clever illustrations that one gets a good
99620	102860	intuitive understanding of AI.
102860	111140	So you have high praise from some of the titans of a number of different disciplines,
111140	114740	and I think that's a good way to take the next step.
114740	124600	The next step is I'm in conversation with someone who is familiar with at least three
124600	135500	important domains, mathematics, physics, and computer science, as well as artificial
135500	142920	intelligence, which I would put in as part of the computer science part of this.
142920	152120	So I see from my research of your background is you really have excelled as an interpreter,
152120	158880	as someone who's been able to translate between these domains.
158880	164200	And as a result, we'll be looking a little later in the show about how your childhood
164200	173640	reading and those books help you create this kind of ability to map and track other thought
173640	180200	processes in other domains and make them accessible to ordinary people.
181200	190400	Yeah, so we humans are all masters of analogy, even when we don't know it.
190400	196200	So let's think about a kind of unconscious analogy.
196200	199480	One example that I use is the notion of a bridge.
199480	201280	We all know what a bridge is.
201280	205800	We all drive across bridges or we walk across bridges, whatever, but we also talk about
205800	212960	bridges like the bridging the gender gap, or the bridge of a song, or the bridge of
212960	221960	my nose, or there's all kinds of ways in which these terms are used metaphorically or by
221960	226800	analogy throughout language, even unconsciously.
226800	234520	But this kind of ability we have to extend concepts in this metaphorical way, and it's
234520	241920	not just bridge, you could do it with almost any concept we want to talk about, is, I claim,
241920	245720	what gives us our unique kind of intelligence.
245720	255240	It allows us to understand more and more abstract notions in terms of very physical notions.
255240	261120	Like you just said, you know, she has sunny face, so we all instantly know what that means.
261120	266480	And we know, we don't even think of it necessarily as a metaphor.
266480	271560	It's just so, you know, I might say, oh, you gave me such a warm introduction, you know,
271560	275800	and it was, it wasn't literally warm, right?
275800	281040	The temperature in this room didn't literally go up, I don't think, but it's something
281040	285480	that we all couch all of our abstract thinking in.
285480	290520	And this is exactly what AI systems today are lacking.
290520	298720	They can learn to recognize photos of bridges, but they can't make that extension and talk
298720	308840	about, you know, a bridge between two people, you know, you and I, or you may be your bridgingness,
308840	313280	the culture of science with the culture of humanities, or things like that.
313280	318240	So that's fascinating to me, and that's what my research is on, is trying to understand
318280	326120	how human concepts are formed, what kind of structure they have, and how we might give
326120	328360	such a concept to a machine.
328360	337800	Yeah, presumably we're some ways away from AI understanding it's raining cats and dogs.
337800	345200	Or, or she has a heart of gold.
345200	351360	I mean, yeah, we don't, we, one problem with talking about AI is that we, when we talk
351360	354720	about understanding, we don't really know exactly what we mean.
354720	357760	What is it to understand something?
357760	363160	That's actually been debated quite a bit by philosophers for millennia.
363160	366320	And it's really an unanswered question.
366320	371760	It's one of those words we use to describe our mental state that we don't quite understand
371760	373920	scientifically what it means.
374000	381720	I think in terms of kind of the sort of intuitive understanding we have of that notion, you're
381720	386280	absolutely right, machines don't have the same kind of understanding of language that
386280	388080	we humans have.
388080	397240	I'm wondering as well if part of that issue has to do with, you've written about GPT-3
397240	400440	making a knowledges in medium.
400440	406680	And you've said that with metaphors there isn't a right answer.
406680	411400	There's an effective explanation or description that convey information.
411400	415760	It's really a conveyor from the abstract to the concrete.
415760	422200	But it's not, you can't really say it's 100% right.
422200	424400	It can be close to right.
424400	432440	What goes back to what you were talking about a moment ago is how we understand that transition
432440	437360	from the abstract into something that's concrete.
437360	444560	Is it giving us with that similarity a true representation from what the abstract really
444560	445560	means?
445920	456520	Yeah, it's machines, they've been shown to be what people in AI call very brittle, meaning
456520	463680	that they have this kind of appearance of being intelligent until suddenly something
463680	465200	shows you very clearly.
465200	470280	It's like it's a breaking point and that's why it's brittleness that they didn't understand
470280	475320	at all what the language they were using meant.
476080	486160	What of my favorite things I saw on social media some time ago was someone had taken
486160	492400	an apple and written the word iPad on a piece of paper and put that on the apple with a
492400	500920	rubber band and then ask an AI for questions or for answers to what this is and it said
500960	504040	with 90% probability it's an iPod.
507640	518920	So that kind of literalism, you can see it's part of that inability to deal with analogies
518920	519920	and metaphors.
519920	527640	And again, you've talked about in how analogies shape our thoughts, what happens if you strip
527720	534480	away metaphors, simile, and analogies from language, what is left?
535960	538040	Are we left just with abstractions?
538040	545280	Is that the part of the problem that we have with storytelling AIs is that they lack the
545280	554120	essential building blocks of how you tell a story, which basically is the bricks of that
554200	557920	building of that story really are metaphorical, a lot of them.
559120	561200	That's one of the problems for sure.
561880	565880	Another problem is that AI systems don't understand how the world works.
566680	576840	You know, they don't know that they don't know that, you know, if a child is holding
576840	582520	an ice cream cone and then the ice cream cone falls on the ground, that that would be upsetting
583320	585000	because how are they going to know that?
585000	587960	They haven't experienced the world the way that we have.
588840	594600	They don't even know that, you know, when an ice cream cone hits the ground that it's going,
594600	597640	it's not edible anymore, and you wouldn't want to eat it.
598440	599320	How would they know that?
601000	605480	It goes back to what you've written about as well of saying that the problem with AIs,
605480	606760	that lacks common sense.
607720	613960	And common sense is if you drop the ice cream cone, even a four-year-old knows it's no longer
613960	622600	something you want to eat or an AI system would not have that particular response because it's
622600	629080	not an embodied biological entity that learns certain things about food from a very early age.
629720	630760	That's exactly right.
631720	636520	So that's the, you know, that's one of the big problems is how do you get a system like
637560	644120	GPT-3 or any other AI system to get that kind of knowledge about the world that we all have,
644120	650200	you know, as children, we all learn so much by just living and existing in the world.
650920	655960	You know, part of what you've written that strikes me as very interesting as well is
656920	662840	that a lot of the analogy making we have comes from an unconscious part of our brains.
663400	669880	There was, when you start to think of analogies, they will come to you and if I ask, well,
669880	670840	where did that come from?
671800	672760	Probably don't really know.
673400	679640	It's just, it's been triggered by some, some gesture, some thought, something that you're not
679720	681080	really connected to.
681080	685880	You can make up a story of why you access that, but it's just that.
685880	687240	It's just a story.
687240	688200	You don't really know.
688840	698200	So AI does not have an unconscious matrix in which to draw upon to pull those analogies
698200	703320	and metaphors from a huge reservoir.
703960	710920	I mean, presumably that material for analogy making is as close to infinite as a human can
710920	711400	get to.
712200	720600	And as a result, it's very hard, I would think, to program into a computer intelligence
720600	727160	an analogy making function because it goes much deeper than just being able to calculate
727240	734440	precisely what the next best move is in chess or goal or Atari.
735800	736040	Right.
738120	746040	Our analogy making comes in part from the fact that we have this huge store of memories.
747720	752520	And, you know, if you might, you probably have the experience where somebody tells you a story
752520	755160	and you say something like, oh, the same thing happened to me.
755880	756200	Yes.
756200	756760	Right.
756840	761320	And of course, the same thing literally didn't happen to you because you're not that other person.
762120	770920	But you, something about their story triggers a memory that you somehow mapped on to the story
770920	775000	that they just told you happens to us all the time every day.
775000	778360	You know, someone says something about their life and you say, oh, yeah, me too.
779160	779560	Right.
779560	783240	And that's like, you know, you're making an analogy between their life and your life.
783240	785080	And it's just constant.
785080	793480	But it has to do with an interaction between our perceptual abilities, our memories, our pattern
793480	797160	recognition facilities and so on.
797160	800200	And this is something we haven't yet figured out how to give to machines.
800920	808520	I'm wondering as well whether that exchange also falls under the heading of empathy,
809080	811240	which is something a machine doesn't have.
811240	816840	Is that you will say, oh, that's similar because you have a theory of mind about that person.
816840	823720	You can put yourself in that position and see that as happening to you and that you would have
823720	829400	had a similar response to a particular event or an object or a gesture.
830440	831960	Yeah, that's absolutely right.
831960	837880	And, you know, one of the things about humans is they're incredibly socially oriented,
838600	845880	meaning that they're always trying to understand other people that they encounter from the earliest
845880	850360	infancy and they're able to put themselves in the position of other people.
851080	860680	So that's something that, again, is very human and so perhaps essential for intelligence.
861400	862680	You know, we don't know.
862680	867640	Usually AI people often think of intelligence as something kind of separable from
868520	873080	things like empathy and emotions and it's pure rationality.
873080	879240	But I think a lot of people are now trying to make sense of how the centrality of these
880040	884360	or emotional aspects of our intelligence.
885000	891320	Right. Well, what I'd like now to do with this background in terms of metaphors,
891320	899640	analogies to move on to your reading list, which I hope that we'll be able to get into how
900440	908440	this may have been a training set and education for you into the world of metaphor,
908440	910840	simile and analogy making.
911480	916440	So let's start with really your background, your first books.
917080	919160	You're at home.
920040	924920	Was the first books from your mother or your father or a sibling?
925560	930920	I mean, how did you come to first have that book, that first book in your hand?
932120	933160	The first book?
933800	941640	Yeah. In other words, we look at the first book on the list, which is The Phantom Tooth Toe Book,
941640	943800	which is an absolutely wonderful book.
943800	948920	I'm so glad you chose that. I can't wait to get into it, but let's just start for a moment.
948920	954440	And how did you come to have that book in your possession and how old were you?
956440	962840	Wow. I was, I'm guessing I was about eight or nine, something like that.
963960	971560	And I really don't remember at all how I got that book, who gave it to me or anything.
971640	979400	Somehow it appeared, sort of like The Phantom Toe Booth in the book just suddenly appeared.
979400	980600	No one knew where it came from.
983400	989400	Did you grow up in a reading environment where your parents were reading or siblings were reading?
989400	993880	And then that kind of storytelling from reading was kind of a natural
995240	999000	bridge from one to the other. You're reading books, you're telling stories, you're reading books.
999880	1012360	Yeah. My parents both were avid readers and read to us from earliest childhood.
1018280	1023640	I just, I can't remember any time when I couldn't read or didn't spend most of my time reading.
1023640	1029080	So I loved reading as a child. I did too. That's why I'm doing this show.
1029640	1037400	And I think that the people who have that experience or fortunate for a lot of reasons,
1037400	1047080	because it does ground, I think, a person in the ability to be curious about stories,
1047080	1052680	about other people's stories, and to learn from them and to apply that learning to new
1052760	1060520	and novel situations. Which is, you know, basically that's so much of what you're doing as well is
1062200	1068920	how do you deal with surprise? And how you deal with surprise is something that you can learn
1069560	1076520	through the experiences of characters in books. You can see that experience is something,
1076520	1083080	oh, that person was surprised. They reacted in this way. And that has the profound implication
1083080	1094440	for your own feeling about security in the world, how I would react. So the phantom toll booth by
1095240	1104120	Norton Justin, you know, he, he just recently died in March of this year at age 92.
1104360	1113800	But he left behind this absolutely wonderful book. You know, there's the little bored boy named Milo,
1114920	1122040	who's, you know, has this kit, which he has to assemble, which is toll booth. Comes with two toll booths.
1122040	1124520	It just appears also. That was very, it's
1125320	1129480	Magically, it's striking to me that this thing just appeared in his bedroom.
1129480	1130040	Right.
1130040	1131560	Where did it come from?
1132520	1137720	Exactly. So that's the first question you're asking at eight or nine, right? It is,
1138440	1147160	how did Milo end up with this kit in his room? So what does he do with that?
1148360	1154600	He puts it together. He assembles it, right? So there's an immediately kind of an engineering
1154600	1161640	puzzle making aspect to the book, which I almost, all the scientists I've talked to,
1161640	1170040	there's some book like that. Here is a puzzle. If I put it together, what representation do I see?
1171560	1179640	And so for Milo, he also has a little electric car. So once he's assembled the toll booth,
1180200	1189000	he's got the map, the rules, two tokens, drops one in, takes off and starts driving. And
1191000	1197720	I could see where your love and passion for metaphor and analogy would have started at eight
1197720	1205560	or nine with this book. I mean, a dog's body shape like a cock, a watchdog.
1206280	1215160	Right. That was another thing. It was all the word play and Hans was just so enchanting.
1217160	1223880	So yeah, I mean, there you go. You're certainly starting to see that word play,
1224840	1234680	a clock body for a dog, a watchdog, and then a bug that just brags and brags about its own
1235480	1244840	abilities and claims, which aren't true, which is a humbug. And so Milo basically teams up with
1244840	1255960	these two, doesn't he? The humbug and the watchdog to go on an adventure and they end up in the empire
1255960	1263800	of wisdom. But the problem is there's no rhyme or reason. Right. The princesses.
1264760	1275080	Exactly. The two sisters. Yes. So they set out for a quest to rescue them, right,
1275880	1285240	and to bring the two sisters rhyme and reason back into the empire of wisdom.
1285400	1292760	And again, part of the word play here, it's quite wonderful, is on their journey,
1293320	1300120	you know, running into the mountain of ignorance where there's the ever present word snatcher,
1301560	1305160	which is quite the person who's constantly interrupting them.
1305480	1316200	The terrible triumphant, waste time doing unimportant and trivial tasks. The sense
1316200	1322440	taker, the person who wastes time filling out countless wasteful forms to no particular end.
1324040	1332920	So ultimately, they, they succeed, right? Milo. Oh, yes. The humbug, the watchdog. Yes.
1333320	1346440	By rescuing the two sisters rhyme and reason. Now, what out of that, the phantom of toll booth,
1347080	1354760	if you can kind of recreate what it was that in your mind as you read it as a child,
1355320	1360440	how you process that. I mean, you're processing some things which were a kid could be a little bit
1360440	1368680	maybe frightening, like demons. And some of the demons are described in quite vivid detail,
1368680	1375080	long nose, green eyed, curly haired, wide mouth, thick neck, broad shoulder, round body,
1375080	1381960	short arm, bow legged, big footed monster. That's the demon of insecurity or insincerity.
1382600	1390760	Mm-hmm. Yeah. That, I mean, part of the book, I remember, were some wonderful illustrations
1391480	1397480	by Jules Pfeiffer. Right. I mean, I didn't know who he was when I was, you know, that child, but I
1397480	1406040	certainly knew him later on. And they were fantastically evocative and terrifying, some of
1406040	1414280	them. I still remember that there was a man who had no face. I don't know if you saw that one,
1414280	1422760	but that was a really terrifying thing. Right. Right. So it introduced a wordplay
1422760	1431160	world and a visual world in between the covers of the same book. Yes. Yes. And there were, you know,
1431800	1438920	I, there were two kind of two different cities. One was concerned with words and the other was
1438920	1446360	concerned with numbers. Right. So that this kind of separation between sort of the world of numbers
1446360	1451560	and the world of words was one that I think I already was starting to resonate with because
1451560	1460040	I felt like I had sort of interests in both, in both of those worlds. That's, that's interesting. So
1461560	1468280	here's a child book, The Phantom Toe Booth, which actually opens up
1470840	1479560	a window to two different kinds of cultures. Mm-hmm. There's the culture of language and words,
1479560	1487080	and then there's the culture of mathematics and numbers. And there's a, there are border lines
1487080	1494360	between those, but here's an author who's able to cross those borders at will, going from numbers
1494360	1500360	to representations, representations to numbers. That had to be a thrilling thing for you as a child.
1501720	1506920	Yeah. I remember really, really being struck by that idea that these things were, you know,
1507640	1512760	they were very separate and that, and there was this, you know, I, I'm sort of only vaguely
1512760	1518120	remembering a lot of this book I have to admit, but that's one of the things that was striking to me.
1519320	1526920	That's interesting. So this is a book that I presume you would recommend for, for parents and
1526920	1536200	teachers and others, if you want to inspire a young person in the world of metaphor and
1536200	1544840	analogies and mathematical objects, this is, this is a place to start because it, it is accessible.
1546200	1550920	It's very accessible and kids, children love it. I, I read it to my own two children,
1551880	1559240	many years ago. And they, I, I don't know if they loved it as much as I did, but I remember them
1559240	1565880	that they, they, they found it quite amusing, all the word play and puns and everything.
1566760	1572920	That's interesting. So the tradition of the first book on your list that you had as a child,
1573640	1578680	you made a point of sharing that experience with your own two children
1579480	1585320	in order to pass along, which you hope would be a similar kind of experience.
1586280	1590840	Yeah. And I haven't asked them if they remember that book. I should ask them someday.
1591320	1600200	No. I think it would be interesting to go back for parents to go back to children, particularly
1600200	1608360	if they're late teens or early adults and say, do you remember when I, when we read this book
1608360	1614200	together? Do you, do you have any memories of this? Did it have any impact on your life?
1614200	1622680	Because it had an impact on mine. I was on a conversation with someone on a talk show
1623720	1627160	where I talked about this book and I talked about you. Right.
1627560	1632200	Full circle. Right. Y'all, I'll ask them.
1634520	1642520	The next book, another wonderful selection is A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine Naingal.
1644440	1649560	Again, I'll give just a little bit of an introduction because I don't expect you to
1649560	1654840	remember all the details of this. You've read a long time ago, but before I get to that,
1654840	1660920	about what age were you when you read this? That one I remember because I, we read it in
1660920	1669320	my fourth grade class, which is nine years old. Okay. So at nine years old, you're reading about a
1669320	1677480	high school student named Meg Murray and her younger brother Charles Wallace and their friend
1677560	1684200	Calvin O'Keefe. And basically it's a quest, right? Where the father who's a scientist
1684760	1693480	has gone missing. He's disappeared. No one knows where he is for a year. And suddenly out of kind
1693480	1701800	of nowhere, this is the magic of children's literature, someone arrives called Mrs. Wetzit.
1702680	1709160	And Mrs. Wetzit is one of these creatures from another dimension
1710040	1717480	who comes with information about the father. And she also has two friends,
1717480	1728520	Mrs. Who and Mrs. Witch. So Mrs. Wetzit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Witch become the guides
1729240	1735320	for these three youngsters who are able to find a wrinkle in time, a pteroset,
1736680	1743240	to be able to go into another dimension to follow the trail of the missing father.
1744920	1755080	Now, so what we have then is this notion of searching for a parent, which is something I think
1755080	1760680	all children can probably relate to. The father's missing. What can I do to find my dad?
1761320	1766520	What help can I find? It goes back to your earlier point where social creatures,
1767240	1775480	we seek other people around us that we trust to help us on our quest. This goes from the Lord of
1775480	1784600	the Rings to a wrinkle in time. It's the same kind of dynamic. As you find your allies, those people
1784600	1789960	that you've bonded with who see the world pretty much like you do, that will watch your back when
1789960	1802680	you're going into the unknown. So what I like about the story is the secret weapon that Meg
1802680	1811800	discovers through Mary's trials and tribulations of trying to find the father. And ultimately,
1811800	1820840	she goes back to confront this dark AI kind of force, which is taken over and made everything
1820840	1835080	the same and controls the mind of everyone within this AI's domain. Except Mrs. Wetzit says there is
1835160	1843480	a secret weapon. You'll have to look deep in yourself and you'll find it. If you can find that
1843480	1852760	weapon and you go back to this place and use it, you will be able to find and retrieve your father.
1853320	1854680	Do you remember what the weapon was?
1859640	1866360	Love. Yes, that's what I was going to say. Right. Yeah, it was a little corny there.
1870040	1879080	But yes. Corny in a way, but on the other hand, very humanizing because it is, again, with that
1879080	1888040	notion of self-sacrifice. And maybe that's something that we do well as humans, and maybe we should
1888040	1897400	do better. But the real notion of love is that ability to sacrifice yourself for another. It's
1897400	1902840	not necessarily just the romantic part of it. It's a self-sacrifice. And here's a daughter
1902920	1913640	who is willing to self-sacrifice for her father that disabled the AI. AI was defeated at that point.
1915880	1924920	Gosh, I don't even remember that it was an AI. Was it a machine? Well, I'm saying an AI. It's called
1925480	1933800	it. Okay, I do remember that. Yeah. And it's, my notes here, all objects and places appear exactly
1933800	1943480	alike because the whole planet must conform to the terrifying rhythm pulsation of it. A giant
1944040	1952600	disembodied brain. Now, that seems to me to be a reasonably good description of for a child of
1952600	1962840	what an AI is. This big disembodied brain, in this case, having a kind of super level of intelligence
1962840	1970840	as opposed to the kind of AI intelligence that confuses a writing of iPod for an apple.
1971240	1984360	Right. Yeah. I mean, the thing that for me that stands out in my memory about this book is,
1985560	1993240	first of all, the female scientists, like both Meg and her mother. Her mother was a brilliant
1993240	1999560	scientist. And I really, you know, I think this was one of the first books I had read or
2001320	2007800	encountered that had such characters that had female scientists, people who are interested in
2007800	2015720	science. And also this notion of multiple dimensions. That was sort of my first introduction to that
2015720	2021640	idea of like the fourth dimension and this notion of a tesseract. And I remember that very clearly,
2021640	2028520	that that, you know, explaining that this is a four dimensional cube. And it was just fascinating
2028520	2038680	to me. I think that's exactly the kind of thing I was hoping to hear is that here's a book that
2038680	2049480	opened up the role of genders. And that you could see for the first time as a child that women are
2049480	2059000	as capable as men, and that women can be scientists, that they can also head up a quest and an
2059000	2069800	adventure. It doesn't have to be a boy. It can be a girl who actually does all the hard work of
2070760	2078200	putting together the team, charting the journey, assessing the risks, and ultimately finding the
2078200	2088520	solution. So that must have made a bit of a change in terms of how you thought about your own
2088520	2095720	potential as a young girl. It probably did. You know, I don't remember that explicitly, but I do
2095720	2103400	remember, you know, very much identifying with the Meg character. And also just being very intrigued
2103400	2111080	by her mother. Right. Because at that time, my own mother at that time was a housewife.
2113160	2120600	My father was an engineer. I hadn't really encountered women doing being scientists.
2121400	2129880	But maybe that's part of the real beauty of early reading is it provides multiple role models for
2129880	2136600	children. Because when you grow up, your role models are your mom, your dad. Okay, I have a model of
2136600	2143960	a man as an engineer, a model of a woman as a housemaker. And suddenly you're reading a book where,
2144600	2152200	you know, there are other models out there. There are other kinds of things that people do, other
2152200	2163560	kinds of identities that they're able to shape and create a life with. So that so that that book,
2163560	2170920	I could see would be a quite important foundational one for your own kind of psychological development
2170920	2177960	and perhaps confidence that yeah, there are some other roles out there for women other than which
2177960	2190440	just what I'm saying around me. Yeah, definitely. Okay, so to leave the world of fiction for a moment,
2190440	2199320	to look at the next book on your list, which is The Universe and Dr. Einstein by Lincoln Barnett.
2199320	2206440	Now, I've heard you say on another webcast that you read this in high school, and it was responsible
2206520	2214280	for you to pursue a degree in physics. Right, so that I absolutely I read that in high school.
2214840	2221800	I think it was suggested by my physics teacher. And I absolutely loved it. You know, it was a
2221800	2230520	popular exposition of Einstein's theory of relativity. It was fairly short, extremely
2231240	2240920	clear and well written. And it just, you know, astounded me, these ideas. And the fact that you
2240920	2250280	could just, you know, Einstein relied quite a bit on thought experiments, you know, what she
2250280	2258280	called gedonkin experiments, where he didn't actually have a lab or, you know, be doing,
2258280	2262600	you know, writing down lots of equations. But he was just kind of thinking about how things might
2262600	2269320	work. And thinking, you know, well, what happens if the speed of light is constant?
2270040	2275400	But what would that imply? And all of that was just very eye opening for me. And I decided I
2275400	2282680	wanted to study physics in college. It's interesting. Again, I can see a little bit of a link here
2282680	2289000	between the wrinkle of time, because he's dealing with other dimensions. And also, he's dealing with
2290680	2298440	reasoning, not in a lab, but by way of analogy, by way of visualization. So he's using
2298440	2308280	metaphors, and he's using concrete examples of trains moving in order for that thought experiment
2308280	2315560	to allow, in which he's doing a reversal, he's using analogies as a reversal process
2316600	2328040	to come up with an abstraction about an aspect of time, space, velocity, momentum, and
2329880	2337160	to come up with the mathematics of the metaphors that he thought at his desk.
2338360	2344200	Exactly. Yeah. So that was, that was quite, quite fascinating for me.
2345240	2351240	So again, I think, you know, I can see this a little bit in your own work that you,
2351240	2357880	you're able to see the metaphor making isn't just a translation of the hard mathematics.
2358600	2367160	Einstein in this book, the universe, and Dr. Einstein, shows that it can go the other way as
2367160	2377320	well. You can go from the childlike storytelling of multidimensions to creation of mathematical
2377320	2387000	models that try to come up with a more abstract general way of explaining what a phenomenon is.
2387000	2397640	Is that? Yes. Yeah. I mean, much later, I read another book, you know, now as an adult about
2397640	2406600	Einstein, and it hypothesized that, you know, Einstein was a patent officer in Switzerland.
2407240	2410680	And one of the things that people in Switzerland were trying to do at the time
2411640	2417400	was, how do you synchronize clocks between train stations? Because this was an important
2417400	2422120	thing to make trains, you know, be able to follow their schedule. So, so he was thinking about this
2422120	2429320	extremely practical problem. But thinking about the implications of what does it mean to synchronize?
2429320	2437720	What does it mean for time to be synchronized? And blowing that up into this incredibly profound
2438440	2447640	truth about the universe and about time itself. So, you know, that's like, as you say,
2447640	2454680	it's kind of the reverse metaphor. It's like he sees the very concrete thing of trains and
2454680	2463720	synchronization and so on. And then he is able to expand that idea into something much more general
2463720	2470680	and much more profound. You wonder if he had that kind of aha moment because, you know, the
2470680	2478360	history of our species, you know, for 200,000 years would have been, we think of time as absolute,
2479160	2486360	of spaces unchanging and absolute. And suddenly to have a thought, it's not absolute,
2487160	2494280	it's relative. And to take that on the implications of that on, and I think we're,
2494280	2501480	we're still trying to come to terms with the implications of what that means with time being
2501480	2511240	relative. Because all of our earthly experiences prepare us for kind of an absolute, absolutist
2511320	2518920	notion of time. And you're someone who challenged what is probably one of the bedrock notions
2520040	2526840	that most people have. And I can see you're in high school now, and you're thinking,
2527800	2535080	if time can, is not absolute and can be challenged, what else is there in physics
2535080	2542920	that will allow me to do similar kinds of challenges to what are basic understandings of
2542920	2547960	the world, which work on one level, but are fundamentally incorrect?
2551480	2560120	Yeah, I don't know if I was thinking all that, but yeah, I didn't, yeah, I was trying to just get
2560120	2569960	my mind around that, that whole very counterintuitive ideas. Yes, yes. So by the time you're in high
2569960	2581960	school, you've decided that physics is the career path that you wanted to take. And you've, you've
2581960	2588760	said that this, this particular book is one of the books that probably was influential in setting
2588760	2598680	you on that path. Yes. So again, I think it shows childhood reading has enormous implications,
2599880	2605880	because what it does is it starts a train of thought, and that train of thought leads people
2605880	2612520	into a direction which they may not have otherwise taken, but for having come across to read that
2612520	2615480	book. Absolutely. Yes.
2619400	2629320	The next book, Fads Balaces in the Name of Science by Martin Gardner. I hadn't been familiar with
2629320	2637000	this book, but it's an absolutely timely book to, to discuss. I mean, this is pre-internet,
2637000	2648200	pre-fake news, you know, pre silos on Twitter and Facebook and the rest of it. He's taking on
2648920	2658760	the whole kind of area of quack remedies, of cranks, and how cranks have, you know, historically been
2658760	2664520	able to get quite a good audience. They didn't need social media to come along to give them an
2664840	2672280	audience. I mean, now that has been quite effective, but before they had publishers
2673320	2680280	that were quite willing to publish their books because there was an audience for what cranks
2681480	2685160	had to say, even though it was clearly wrong.
2685560	2696040	So, tell me a little bit about what age you were and the circumstances of coming across this book.
2698840	2706360	So, I think I was in college. I don't quite remember, but I loved Martin Gardner. You know,
2706360	2714200	he was a long time columnist for Scientific American. He was an incredible communicator
2715240	2725480	of math. He was a math puzzle fanatic and a math puzzle creator and a wonderful writer,
2727320	2734440	just super playful person interested in all kinds of things. So, I had been reading, you know,
2734440	2742120	I read his column and I picked up, I guess I picked up this book and found it really just,
2742120	2749560	you know, thinking about what drives people to believe things and sort of, and as you say,
2749560	2757880	it's very relevant now is sort of, what is science? Why do we believe science? What is
2757880	2764840	different between science and all these kind of quack beliefs? And that's something, you know,
2764840	2770680	I think we all still struggle with. I think it's probably right. I mean, one of the things that
2770680	2779640	seemed to me from my reading of the book is the central role that Gardner thought that the
2779640	2786120	scientific community played. And again, it goes back to that kind of social role that we are
2786920	2796520	social people and that we learn from each other. And usually, he says the crank is someone who's
2796520	2803800	almost always outside the scientific community. They don't have colleagues to bounce the ideas off
2803800	2808680	and not going to conferences, listening to other people's papers. They're not presenting their
2808680	2818440	papers for peer review or for comment by other people. And as a result, it's easy to get off
2818440	2825800	the rails because there's no one to say you're off the rails. Right. And they get these cult
2825880	2838120	followings where they get reinforced, you know, people people are believing them. And he said that
2838120	2848840	there are really a couple of signifiers for a crank is one of them is that person stands entirely
2848840	2855080	outside the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and evaluated.
2855800	2864120	And secondly, as a tendency to paranoia. But I think one of the things that people may say
2864120	2872280	is, well, the scientific community is not that perfect. That maybe some of the grants and the
2872280	2879880	money that comes from them are twisting the dogma in ways that favor the people who are funding
2879880	2886600	studies and so forth. And therefore, can we really trust dogma that's coming out of a scientific
2886600	2901560	community that is not as pure science as we would wish it to be. Sure. And science is done by humans,
2901560	2907000	right. And humans have their own prejudices and biases and
2909000	2914680	influences. And it's just a human endeavor. But what we do have in science is we have
2915800	2923160	replication, we have, you know, community sort of think things are wrong all the time. But
2923160	2931480	eventually, people discover that they're wrong. We have kind of this notion of consensus.
2932200	2937320	There's certain things that are consensus, eventually, in the scientific community. And
2938280	2945560	that those consensus, the consensus believe can eventually be overturned. But it's,
2946280	2958280	it's, it is a community. And I think, you know, it has, I don't know how to say this,
2960920	2966600	why should we trust scientists as opposed to anyone else? It's because I think scientists
2968120	2974280	are, I mean, part of the deal of being a scientist is that you're always trying to disprove your own
2974280	2981880	work. And you try as hard as you can. And that's the fundamental thing. You always are trying to be
2981880	2988760	skeptical of everything in your own work. And if you pound on it and pound on it and people
2988760	2994280	replicate it and replicate it, finally you come to as close as you can to what you might call
2994280	3002360	verification. So yeah, I mean, it's perfect for sure. That's a very good description. I mean,
3003320	3010360	I think in terms of sciences, also it creates a cultural, cultural aspect of thinking,
3011080	3017480	where scientists tend to be comfortable with uncertainty, at least more comfortable than
3017480	3024520	most people, because they understand that even the existing dogma is a tentative position.
3024520	3031320	It's not yet disproved. There will be flaws in it, in that every time someone thinks they've come
3031320	3039000	up with an absolute answer, they've usually found out that that's not the case. And so there is more
3039000	3047480	of a humility. I mean, you have some big eagles in science, as you would expect. But the idea is
3047480	3056920	to be humble in the face of new changing information that requires constant revaluation
3057080	3065240	and updating, where the people who are the cranks have the absolute truth. There is no updating
3065240	3072600	that is needed. It's all defense of the existing structure. The structure is perfect,
3073240	3081480	it can't be improved upon, and you either believe this or you don't. You're either part of our
3081480	3087240	belief system or you're not. That, it seems to me, is very anti-scientific.
3090600	3097400	So the book by Gardner, and his books have appeared on the list of other guests as well.
3097400	3104040	He's someone who's had, I think, a profound influence in terms of educating a whole
3105000	3111720	couple of generations of thinkers and mathematicians and physicists and artists and others who
3112760	3119400	want to look deeply at those kinds of ways of thinking and processing reality.
3120120	3126360	And science is just a different way of processing reality through investigation,
3126360	3134680	observation, testing, reevaluation, and understanding that no matter what the result
3134680	3140440	appears to show today, it may be overturned in the next week.
3142440	3149000	I think one other thing you can say about Martin Gardner is that he was an incredible
3149560	3160600	expositor of science and math, and kind of was a model for me, myself, of trying to write
3160600	3166600	for the general public about science. How do you make things clear? How do you make things
3166600	3174280	entertaining? How do you make things accessible? I'm glad you mentioned that, because the reviews
3174280	3182680	of your books, all point to the fact that you've done this with enormous success, is to be able to
3182680	3191400	use those metaphors and analogies to go from the very hard mathematical world of pure science
3191960	3198760	into another language that most people can understand and relate to. That's a very
3198760	3205720	particular skill. It's a little bit like translation. Where I live, translation is a very
3205720	3214920	important aspect of life, and you get people who are, say, bilingual, but as I say, there's a
3214920	3222120	difference between being bilingual and bicultural. To know another language is not necessarily to
3222120	3230200	know that culture. You are bilingual and bicultural, and that's a real advantage, and I think someone
3230200	3238600	like Martin Gardner was like that as well, who understood both cultures and understood the
3238600	3242920	language and the barriers of communication between those cultures.
3251400	3260920	Just for the people watching, some of the chapters in this book by Martin Gardner
3260920	3268760	on fads and fallacies, he takes on the flat earth people, the hollow earth, I hadn't heard that one
3268760	3281640	before, monsters of doom, flying saucers, down with Einstein, dousing rods and doodle bugs, geology
3281640	3292520	versus Genesis, Atlantis, the Great Pyramids, medical cults, from homeopathy to natural
3292520	3304760	apathy, and food fattice, so dynetics. He covers a fair range of the traditional kind of cult-like
3305480	3311720	absolutists, fad friends that a lot of people were attracted to.
3313480	3321400	Still are, in some cases. It still are, and as a result, maybe this is a book that has to be
3322200	3332440	updated for modern times, because social media now is the main vehicle through the internet
3333160	3342200	of being able to create these kinds of pseudoscientific communities which they talk to each other and
3342200	3349080	reinforce each other, but they're reinforcing basically a highly flawed, mistaken view of
3349080	3357080	reality. So the question is, how do you reach them? Martin Gardner's book reached you and probably
3357080	3362840	reached a lot of people of your generation, but the question is, for the new generation,
3364040	3372760	it will this book be one that will allow them to have a different window on social media once
3372760	3380200	they've read it? Yeah, I don't know, I don't know if books are even relevant anymore for a lot of
3380200	3388040	people. Well, this is becoming an issue, and it's part of the reason for the show,
3388920	3397560	is to show the relevance of books. They've been very relevant in your life. I mean, so far when
3397560	3406760	the books that we've gone through, we've seen the Professor Mitchell emerge as a mathematician,
3407720	3414040	as a physicist, and as a computer science, artificial intelligence person,
3415160	3421240	that part of that process, I'm certain it's far more complex, and of course complexity is another
3421240	3429480	one of your areas, more complex than just childhood reading, but childhood reading is part of that
3429560	3438840	nonlinear interplay of factors that have made you construct a model of reality that has served you
3438840	3447880	very well. So the idea is, when people say books are not relevant, I think they're missing a very
3447880	3454200	key important role in how they're relevant and why they're relevant at a particular age.
3455080	3461080	Right. I mean, I was saying that facetiously, of course, but the young people I know today
3461080	3469720	are tend to read a lot less or fewer books than I did as a child. They're reading things on the
3469720	3478040	internet, as you say. We didn't have a choice. We only had books. Correct. So you're probably
3478040	3484440	finding this then in your students? My students, oh yeah, my students, my own children,
3486520	3498280	they just have so many different options for media that books are not number one on their list,
3498280	3508440	I think, the way they were for me. Which is too bad. Yeah. Well, let's hope that this interview,
3508440	3517560	this conversation, will inspire young people to say, I want to be like Melanie. I would love
3517560	3525480	to be able to follow that career path. And here, if it worked for her, maybe this will be the kind
3525560	3534520	of fine tuning that will help sculpt my own mind in a similar direction. That's the goal. We'll see.
3537800	3550680	The next book is One, Two, Three, Infinity by George Gamov, which came out in 1947
3551560	3557080	and explores the fundamental concepts of mathematics and science.
3560680	3564200	Tell us a little bit about your initial reading of the book.
3566200	3574600	Yeah, so this one I read in college. Okay. And I was thinking about all these
3575560	3582280	fundamental ideas, you know, fascinated to read all of this stuff. I remember
3583240	3591080	being very impressed and influenced by it, although I don't totally remember all the content of the
3591080	3600840	book. But I do remember it was very fundamental ideas, especially in mathematics. There are two
3600920	3609720	points in my research of the book that now make me think it had an influence on you is one,
3609720	3616600	it's noted for its quirky sense of humor. That seems to be something that's a thread through
3616600	3623240	all the books that we've looked at so far. And secondly, it's noted for its memorable metaphors.
3624200	3630200	Again, again, something that is a thread through all the books that you've chosen
3630920	3636600	that influenced you as a child. So you were growing up probably without realizing it,
3636600	3642920	that you were having a master class with some of the best mentors on the planet,
3643880	3652200	teaching metaphorical thinking, and teaching humor and ways of entertaining to get people's
3652200	3659720	attention and to explain sometimes very hard, difficult, abstract concepts like number theory,
3661640	3664440	which is done in this book.
3667000	3674520	Yes, absolutely. So I think a lot of these books, I kind of read them and almost,
3675160	3681640	you know, the way that like a film student will analyze a film at a much more kind of
3682440	3688200	like trying to figure out how did the director pull that off? How did they set up that scene?
3689080	3694680	I was quite interested in how do you explain things to people? How do you explain these hard
3694680	3700200	concepts? So I was looking at how are they doing this? How is George Gamoff actually
3700760	3710440	pulling this off? It's true because I think it's a very insightful observation you've made,
3710440	3717320	because in a sense, books like this are a kind of performance art.
3719240	3725560	And if I look at the other people who have cited this book as foundational,
3726200	3733480	they are some of the great science communicators. For example, theoretical physicist Sean Carroll
3734440	3741800	mentions this one, two, three, infinity as setting the trajectory of his professional life.
3744120	3749560	Cognitive scientist Stephen Pinker read the book as a child and cited as contributing to his
3749560	3758600	interest in popular science. And astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has also cited this as one
3758600	3767320	of the greatest of two books that impact on his development, the other one being James Newman's
3767320	3776280	Mathematics and Imagination. So here you have three other great scientific translators,
3776280	3786280	communicators, masters of the metaphor who have had this book come into their life at the right time
3787160	3795800	to say beyond just metaphor and simile and analogy, you have to find ways to entertain people
3796920	3805640	and the entertainment is the way that most people learn. And if you're asking them to go back and do
3805640	3811160	all the foundational for the original abstracts and say of number theory, they're not going to follow
3811240	3817720	you there, they're not going to go down that path. But if you can give them a watchdog,
3817720	3825640	a dog with a clock-like body, they're going to stay with you and follow you down the path
3825640	3835160	because it is fun. Right. And I think George Gamoff also, he was Russian and he had that
3835160	3841960	kind of very dry wit that the Russian writers often have. I think that was something I really
3841960	3852600	appreciated. So humor and metaphor from George Gamoff, one, two, three and infinity, a book
3853320	3860920	which clearly has inspired you and some of the other very important scientific communicators
3860920	3870520	out there cite this book as well, which takes us to your next book, which is a book of essays by
3870520	3877320	one of the world's foremost astronomers, Beyond the Observatory by Harlow Shapley,
3879880	3888040	which is essays on scientific achievements of the 20th century. And one of the things which I
3888040	3895400	thought was kind of an interesting presentation, Breathing the Future in the Past. I don't know
3895400	3901800	if you recall that essay or not, but it was showing how your breath contains more than
3902440	3907960	400,000 Aragon atoms that Gandhi breathed in his long life.
3908680	3921720	Yeah, I do remember that. Bringing science again alive with an illustration here that makes it very vivid.
3924440	3930680	Yes. When did you come? Was this a high school college you came across? That was in college.
3931400	3938760	During college, I became very interested in astronomy and started to actually do some research
3938760	3945320	in astronomy. We had a small observatory that I got involved in sort of a group of students
3945960	3954040	who were doing independent research in astronomy. So I picked up this book and one essay that I
3954040	3964440	remember really clearly was a discussion about how much you can infer from a sort of a single
3964440	3970440	pinpoint of light. You know, you're looking at a star. All you're getting is very, you know,
3971160	3977480	pinpoint of light. And then you can infer, like, what is the chemical makeup of the star? How old
3977480	3986440	is it? Where it fits on the sort of spectrum of different kinds of stars? Is it you can infer? Is
3986440	3992760	it orbiting another star? Is it going to explode? You know, all of these different things. It's just
3992760	4004360	astounding what astronomy can achieve with just this incredibly kind of, you know, seemingly very
4004920	4008760	limited amount of data. So I was very struck by that essay.
4010680	4018600	Did you think of a career in astronomy? Yeah, I did think for a long time that I was going to
4019880	4027080	have a career in astronomy and I did several internships in astronomy labs
4028360	4033240	and thought about going to graduate school in astronomy, but ended up not doing that.
4034520	4042760	Okay. So I guess maybe one of the lessons is that you can be intrigued and enthralled by a
4042760	4049960	particular book that leads you in a direction, but ultimately you decide that's not exactly
4049960	4054280	the full direction of where you want to go. You learn from it and you learn something about
4054280	4062280	yourself from it and take on that knowledge, but get on with another career path.
4064280	4070120	Yes, life is full of twists and turns, of course, that you can't predict.
4073320	4079800	The other essay, which kind of fits into some of the other books that we've discussed,
4080440	4088520	is the Science Outside the Lab, which was one of the essays there, again, which is back to the
4088520	4100280	Einstein book that we discussed earlier, and that there is this kind of notion that science isn't
4100280	4111880	just something that happens in the laboratory. Yeah, I mean, I don't remember that particular essay,
4113480	4119720	but I assume he was talking about sort of what you see out in real life, I mean, what the kind
4119720	4125880	of science takes place by observations that are outside of the lab, just like Einstein.
4126600	4134360	Right, and again, what Shapley's book, from my understanding of these essays,
4134360	4141160	is it's looking at science in a broad way. It's looking at science, sociology, and philosophy as
4141160	4148760	well. In other words, the broader context in which science exists. It's a culture within a larger
4148760	4157960	culture, and you are one of the bridge builders that are crossing that moat where the scientists
4157960	4165000	are inside, talking to each other in a language which would be incomprehensible for most of us
4165000	4173640	listening to ancient Greek. But you've mastered that language and can go over and say, this is what
4173640	4179960	they're really talking about. This is what it really means. Here are some examples. Visualize this,
4179960	4190840	visualize that. Which talking and visualization takes us to Hind's Teeth, Horses Tolls by Stephen
4190840	4200120	Gould, which, oh, wonderful writer, I'm getting waiting for my Smithsonian Institute magazine
4200120	4207400	to arrive here in Bangkok back in the early 90s. And sometimes it wouldn't arrive because I must
4207400	4212120	have been a postman who shared my interest, decided to keep it himself. But in any event,
4213240	4218920	he had a wonderful mind. And tell us how this book came into your life.
4223400	4229560	So when I was in college, one of my housemates was an evolutionary biology major.
4230840	4236680	And he was telling me how I should learn something about this field because I knew nothing about it.
4236680	4246280	I'd never taken a biology class. So I tried to get into, there was a very popular course on
4246280	4251800	evolutionary biology in my college, which I was unable to get into because it was so popular.
4253000	4259640	So this housemate gave me this book, said, read this, this will teach you everything you need to
4259640	4266120	know about. And I had never heard of Stephen J. Gould. I didn't know anything about evolution.
4268440	4274760	So it was a real eye-opener. He's a fantastic writer, just like all of these books are
4276520	4283720	these master science expositors. And talking about some of these
4284680	4292040	sort of really interesting questions that you would never have thought to ask about evolution.
4292920	4297800	So this was my first introduction to a lot of these ideas.
4300200	4306840	What would you think would have been the influence of the book on your own thinking and your own
4306920	4319240	choices and career? Well, it sparked my interest in ideas of evolution, which then
4321800	4331880	went a lot further, especially when I was in graduate school and encountered an
4331880	4339080	entire field called biologically inspired computation, an evolutionary computation,
4339720	4348040	which merged ideas from evolution into computer science. And it's something that I got very deeply
4348040	4357800	involved with later on. So that's an interesting point because in some ways you're drawing an
4357880	4366440	analogy from the evolutionary biology world of Stephen Gould into a quite different realm
4367000	4375080	and seeing that that perspective is transferable. Yes, exactly. That you can use,
4375960	4383720	you could be inspired in a metaphorical way by ideas in one field and apply them into other
4383720	4392520	fields. And interestingly, that's exactly what happened with Darwin, who sort of came up with
4392520	4399960	a lot of these ideas. He was inspired by ideas from economics, from geology, and other fields,
4399960	4406120	and he brought that into his own ideas about biology. So there's a lot of these cross-scientific
4406120	4413960	analogies going on. It's an excellent point because certainly with Darwin's generation,
4414600	4422680	there would have been a far broader education. And maybe that's part of the problem we have with AI,
4422680	4432360	is that people are brilliant, but narrowly brilliant in very specific subdomains of subdomains. And so
4432440	4440840	as a result, there isn't the same kind of cross-fertilization of ideas. Like for example,
4440840	4450440	talking with someone who's coding an algorithm about empathy, there may not be an easy bridge
4451320	4457320	with that coder and with those kinds of concepts simply because the background isn't there. They
4457320	4466520	haven't come across the Steven Gould model that what you do is you find someone who is able to
4466520	4472840	explain something brilliantly and see, again, you drew the metaphor of what he's talking about
4472840	4479480	into another realm. You transported that infrastructure, that framework of thinking,
4480200	4486200	and allowed you to see something quite different about computers that other people were not seeing.
4488120	4494120	Well, yeah, I mean, I think I would say I was the one who came up with some of those analogies,
4494120	4505560	but some of my mentors did. Talking about mentors, let's move on to Goethe Escher and Bach by
4505560	4513640	Douglas Hofstadter, who I know was your mentor and an important intellectual force in your life.
4514440	4523480	This book in 1973 was a monumental work. I want to pull a surprise. It is still read and discussed
4523480	4532600	in the shape thinking of a couple generations since it was first published. So you must have
4532600	4543640	read this book before you decided to, this was going to be your thing. You were at university
4543640	4555880	somewhere, you got the book, what happened next? So I read it the year after I graduated from college.
4556520	4563240	Okay. I actually read about it, I read a review of it in Martin Gardner's column in Scientific
4563240	4569400	American, which is how I had heard about it in the first place. So I went out and bought it and
4571320	4579720	it's a very long book. It's not like a beach read, if you will. It takes a lot of thinking.
4580680	4587400	So I read it over the course of many months and decided that this is what I want to work on.
4587960	4595720	And it's really a book about, it's about intelligence and how something like intelligence,
4595720	4603320	as complex as intelligence, can emerge from a non-intelligent substrate, how consciousness
4603320	4609320	might come about. And it uses ideas from mathematics, from music, from art,
4610040	4623160	to kind of eliminate these core ideas. What was the connecting thread that Hofstadter
4623160	4629720	discovered that links together Goethe and Bach and Escher?
4633000	4637560	I say there are several connecting threads, but maybe one of them is this idea of self-reference
4638680	4647080	that is fundamental in Goethe's theorem, his mathematical theorem, because you can get mathematical
4647880	4657320	systems to be talking about themselves, to be referring to themselves. And that shows up in
4657320	4664280	Escher. You see all these kinds of strange kind of loopy references.
4664920	4672440	The hand drawing the hand. Yeah, the hand drawing the hand and so on. And in Bach's music, too,
4672440	4683400	there's some examples that Hofstadter goes into in detail. And this is really the idea of
4683400	4689480	intelligence is a self-rential, what he calls a strange loop, the strange loop of consciousness,
4689480	4696680	where we're able to reflect on our own thinking. A kind of recursion. A kind of recursion, exactly.
4697080	4707880	That goes on. And kind of a meta-thinking as well. So that at each stage recursive part, I mean,
4707880	4718680	Bach's fugues, for example, there is a thing that reoccurs in them. From Nietzsche's eternal
4718680	4726920	return. There are things that are patterns that show up against slightly altered, but recognizable.
4728360	4735480	And that that that is the nature of intelligence, as we understand it.
4736920	4744440	Something like that. Yeah, I mean, it's a... Hofstadter's ideas are not
4745400	4752200	easily expressible in a short period of time. So, but that's kind of getting at the idea
4752200	4761000	of this, what he calls this strange loop. Would you say that this, I mean, this is
4761000	4770200	absolutely foundational book, that maybe it's at the outer edge of where you can use metaphor and
4770200	4778200	summary with these abstractions to convey accurately what is being talked about.
4780760	4786760	Because a lot of people find this book very, very difficult. Yeah, it is difficult. But what's really
4786760	4794200	striking is how much Hofstadter comes up with amazing analogies and metaphors to talk about these
4794200	4805160	things. And that's really, turns out to be what he's most fascinated by is how we think in analogies
4805160	4817160	and metaphors. And he is a master of using these, you know, language and everyday examples
4817800	4822760	to try and illustrate what's going on in these incredibly abstract ideas.
4825320	4836040	So, he's a master cultural translator from these various realms. And again, using what,
4836040	4842120	I mean, I can see the influence because you've done a number of articles on metaphor and
4842120	4850200	analogy, particularly in the context of AI. So that understanding by way of metaphor and
4850200	4856840	analogy has obviously been very central to your own development as a scientist and as an interpreter
4856840	4864120	of science to a larger community. Yeah, and in fact, you know, Hofstadter was the one who
4865000	4872840	introduced me to the idea of building AI systems that can make analogies. That was the
4872840	4881160	topic of my PhD dissertation for which he was the advisor. Right. So this notion of analogy and
4881160	4889560	metaphor kind of circles through all of my research. And it certainly circles through all of your
4889720	4899160	readings as well. Evidently. You're starting to discover a certain kind of pattern that started
4899160	4907720	at age eight. Yeah, I never had made that connection. It's kind of like psychotherapy, right?
4909640	4916440	It's all started in your childhood. Are you still in contact with Professor Hofstadter?
4916440	4926440	Yeah. Yeah. Talk to him from time to time. Okay. So the next book, unless there's something else
4926440	4932680	you'd like to say about that, I think we've kind of established the fact that it's been
4932680	4939960	transformational. I mean, your PhD thesis was about analogies, about the man who had written a book
4940520	4949320	filled full of analogies and metaphors. And that was a watershed book and a watershed period of
4949320	4960280	your life. Absolutely. Yep. The Recursive Universe by William Poundstone, which is really kind of the
4960280	4967160	origin of complexity, which I know is another one of the fields that you've done a fair amount of
4967160	4977400	research and study and writing. And explain a little bit about how this book came to you
4977400	4985320	and what it said to you about complexity that still is important to you.
4985320	4998760	Yes. So this book, I believe I read it in graduate school. I don't remember how I came across it.
5000440	5011400	But what it is, it takes John Conway's Game of Life, which is
5011880	5023880	what's called a cellular automaton. It's not exactly a game. It's more like a very idealized model,
5026280	5035160	very simplified model of complex systems. And it uses this Game of Life and Game of Life is full
5035160	5044280	of little patterns that people have discovered in things that are gliders and other kinds of
5045000	5057800	structures that can do all kinds of computations. And Poundstone uses this as a way to talk about
5057800	5065480	bigger ideas in cosmology and physics. And it's just a fascinating kind of approach to talking
5065480	5071400	about those ideas. And it was one of my introductions to the Game of Life,
5073240	5078920	and I think you've seen sort of how complex that all is and how complexity can emerge from these
5078920	5084200	very simple rules, and then tying it to these much bigger ideas.
5086600	5090760	So I just loved that book. I thought it was beautiful, and it's not that well known. I mean,
5090760	5101560	it's surprisingly, I think, underappreciated. I think from what I've read, I haven't read the book,
5101560	5106040	but I've read about it, and it seems absolutely fascinating in terms of
5107000	5113560	of this notion of self-assembly, of how you can get very complex systems out of something that is
5114280	5123000	in itself very simple. And for example, he gives the example of Pi, where, you know, basically
5123800	5130840	you can encode it using only two terms and end up with this unbelievably complex
5131640	5141400	number from just the initial to write the components to begin with. So I thought it was a
5141400	5147080	quite interesting aspect of it. And the other thing is the initial information input and the
5147080	5157960	relationship of information with entropy. You know, Claude Shannon with Bolson of looking at
5157960	5167640	those two aspects of the universe, from an informational model to a model of
5168280	5174200	the second law of thermodynamics or entropy, where things will go into greater disorder.
5175000	5181720	Yes, exactly. So this book brought together a lot of ideas of complex systems that I had been
5182600	5187320	thinking a little bit about, but never really found them brought all together,
5188040	5195400	including entropy, information, computation, you know, he shows, he talks about Conway's proof that
5196280	5203640	the game of life, which is just, it's just a two-dimensional grid of black and white,
5205160	5211480	what they call cells, that influence each other in simple ways. But this actually you can
5211480	5221240	embed an entire computer in this incredibly simple system. And it's just, it's full of very profound
5221240	5230280	ideas. I know it's kind of fair you teach an online course on complexity, which is highly popular.
5230280	5238360	I read somewhere like 25,000 students have more now, where I read is probably outdated.
5238440	5241720	But it seems to be a very popular, is this one of the books that's
5242680	5249080	in the course? So I don't use the book in that course, but I do talk about a lot of these ideas.
5249720	5259640	I see. Yeah. So we cover that kind of thing. Yeah. Right. Okay. The last book on the list is
5259640	5265960	Adaptations in Natural and Artificial Systems by John Holland. Last but not least,
5266920	5273480	here we have adaptation is a biological process, rearranging genetic material, goes back to what
5273480	5281640	you're talking earlier about Darwin's and in the evolutionary biology that you found an attractive
5281640	5290680	way to take into another domain. So adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems by John Holland,
5291480	5295560	was this something from your university days or earlier?
5295640	5301000	This was from graduate school. So John Holland was one of my professors at the University of Michigan.
5302040	5309160	And he taught a course by, he was a computer science professor, yet he taught a course
5309160	5312760	in computer science called Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems.
5314040	5319880	It's a very technical book. So it's the only technical book on my list, really.
5320040	5329080	But it was, John Holland was the founder of this field called Genetic Algorithms,
5329080	5335720	which brought ideas from evolutionary biology into computer science.
5337400	5347720	And this book was his theory of adaptation. So when you think about adaptation, maybe you think
5347720	5362760	about some kind of species adapting to a particular niche. For instance, you have things like butterflies
5362760	5372840	that the color of their wings change in response to their environment. And so this notion of adaptation
5372840	5380520	is fundamental to biology. And yet Holland brought that into that field of computer science by saying
5380520	5389720	what we want in computer science and AI is to have computers that adapt. So we don't want just
5389720	5396360	living systems that adapt. We want machines that adapt, that are able to adapt to different
5396360	5406520	environments and to be able to be flexible and learn the way that living systems do.
5407720	5417480	So Holland became my co-advisor, along with Douglas Hofstetter. And this book was sort of set
5417480	5425000	the path of a lot of my future research for up until now, really.
5425960	5434200	Yeah. What seemed to me interesting about this book is the part that plays
5434920	5445480	just conceptually of kind of perpetual novelty. That there is no kind of in-point that it's aimed
5445480	5452760	for a particular in-point, that it's always open. And you can't quite predict where it will go,
5452760	5460600	how that co-evolution or that adaptation will go next. I guess that's part of the non-linearity
5460600	5468920	that he discusses in the book, is that we have trouble with things like exponential numbers,
5468920	5476280	non-linearity. These are things that are outside our realm of experiences, like absolute time as
5476280	5484360	opposed to relative time. And this is where you as a communicator of science try to come in and say,
5484360	5491480	well, people are looking to take you to an in-point, but you have to be careful. Because the way
5491480	5496440	in-points work in reality are quite different from the way that they're portrayed.
5498200	5504840	Right. So one interesting thing about this idea of perpetual novelty that Holland
5505400	5512600	talks about, you can imagine that in biology where you're having species continually evolving
5512600	5520440	and changing and the environment's changing. But Holland also brought these ideas into economics.
5521480	5526920	So interestingly, economics, the theory of economics that people,
5528440	5534040	the sort of classical economic theory has to do with equilibrium. You want sort of this economic
5534040	5539080	system to be in equilibrium or markets to be in equilibrium. But this idea of perpetual
5539080	5547800	novelty says such systems are never in equilibrium. And therefore, the classical theories don't describe
5547800	5555240	reality where we actually have this continually changing co-adaptive system of all these economic
5555240	5561160	agents. So that's really been revolutionizing a lot of thinking in economics as well as in
5561160	5573640	biology and computer science. Again, I guess things like global optimum and equilibrium
5573640	5580520	are in a way metaphorical, trying to create the notion that there's an in-point where everything
5580520	5589720	is absolutely balanced as opposed to the fact that in reality, nothing is ever balanced for long.
5589720	5598200	There may be moments in time where it appears that birds and rabbits and dinosaurs had a
5598200	5606120	particular adaptation, but then it doesn't last. It's overtaken by something else. And as a result,
5606680	5618120	you have to live with the uncertainty of a perpetual changing environment and adaptation
5618120	5626840	to those changes. Yes. I think one of your previous guests, John Allen Palos, has a great
5626840	5631720	quote where he says, you know, living with uncertainty is the only certainty.
5634360	5642520	That's something that I could just hear John saying. John's a friend I've known for years.
5642520	5649800	Yeah, very, very brilliant mathematician and, again, a communicator of a high level
5650680	5656600	as you are as well. So I want to thank you for this been a delightful conversation.
5656600	5659880	Let me know, what do you think about the experience of being on the show?
5662760	5669080	It's been a lot of fun. I mean, it's intimidating to try and have to think back on books that I've
5669080	5675960	read years and years and years ago. But you reminded me of a lot of things that I'd forgotten,
5676520	5682680	which has been great. And you also pointed out so many connections that I had never made about,
5683240	5687400	you know, different the books, these books that I've read and the things that I've been
5687400	5694600	thinking about for a long time. So I thank you for that. And thank you. This has been a wonderful
5694600	5704200	conversation. And I will continue to follow your writings and learn from them. You're a master of
5704840	5712760	communication between the arts and the science. And you contribute to both. And I think you have
5713560	5720920	done a great job in that communication. Please keep up this wonderful work.
5720920	5733240	Thank you so much. Bye for now. Okay, bye bye.
