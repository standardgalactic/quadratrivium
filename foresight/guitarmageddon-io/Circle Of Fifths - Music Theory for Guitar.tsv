0	21000	Alright, today I'm going to do a quick video on the circle of fifths.
21000	25320	Now first off, a few prerequisites.
25320	32820	This is not an easy topic per se, so I would recommend that if you knew the notes on the guitar,
32820	38200	and one thing you can do, we have a couple of free courses, guitargames.net, there's
38200	46400	one on guitar notes, you can go there and do that, you just need to know basically some
46400	52520	of the names of the notes and how notes work on the instrument, and also I would recommend
52520	58200	knowing what intervals are, and at least half steps and whole steps, which is covered
58200	63680	in our also free, getting started with music theory, so you might check those out if you
63680	66600	don't know what those are.
66600	73320	Alright, now circle of fifths, first of all, I think everyone knows what a circle is, but
73320	78240	you might not know what a fifth is, so let's talk about that.
78240	86360	So a fifth is an interval, and intervals in music work a little funny.
86360	88280	This is how we count.
88280	99240	So first off, you might see, you know, C, D, E, F, G, and that's a fifth, you notice there's
99240	105400	no zero, you might think okay, it goes C to D, that's one, D to E, that's two, but no,
105400	111320	it's the number of letter names really that are in the interval, so the distance from
111320	114200	C to G is called the fifth.
114200	125120	Let's do another one, let's say you take G, and you go G, A, B, C, D, that's going to
125120	129640	be a fifth, one, two, three, four, five.
129640	136880	On the guitar, you probably recognize this, if you see these two notes played together
136880	145800	this is a fifth, you might see this written like F5 or called an F power chord, and if
145800	153680	you can count from most letter names and just count up, so like say D, D, E, F, G, A, gives
153680	158760	you a fifth, there's only one exception to worry about and that's the note B, and the
158760	166000	funny thing about B is that it goes up to F sharp, so remember that has to do with the
166000	171120	fact that there's no B sharp and no E sharp, and both of those are contained within this
171120	175120	space, so B to F sharp.
175120	184320	Alright now, next, the circle itself, so I took the liberty of pre-drawing my circle,
185080	190720	you should do this on a page, I would practice doing this quite often, and then what we're
190720	202880	going to do is basically make a clock, so start here, I kind of divide it up into four
202880	213080	spaces and then I put the little ticks in here, and what we're going to do is we're
213120	221120	going to start with the note C, and then we're going to go by fifths, so a fifth above C,
221120	233120	C, D, E, F, G, and a fifth above G, G, A, B, C, D, and so on and so forth.
233120	247840	Here's our B, so we know we go to F sharp and not to F, now at this point you could call
247840	254120	this F sharp and you could also call it G flat because the note that's one above F is
254120	260880	also one below G, so I'm going to switch over to flats and you'll see why in just a little
260920	266480	bit here, and keep going, so G flat, now a fifth above G flat, I'm going to stick with
266480	275880	flats, so G flat, A flat, B flat, C flat, D flat, we'll call, okay, and then D flat goes
275880	287520	up to A flat, E flat, and we'll keep going here, B flat, F, and then if you've done it
287560	296400	correctly, you should get F and then F a fifth up is C, so that means success, now what's
296400	298760	the point of this?
298760	303880	It's a beautiful circle there, but by itself it doesn't really mean much, now the primary
303880	310840	use of the circle is to find key signatures and scales, so let's talk about those real
310840	319280	quick, now most of you are probably familiar with what a scale is, it's a collection of
319280	326480	notes that fit well together, they're kind of centered around a certain letter, like
326480	334400	C scale, the root of it is C and the notes all kind of gravitate towards C, and scales
334400	340480	are constructed using whole steps and half steps, so if you remember back to our prerequisites
340480	345440	knowing what those are, it would be good, so a whole step basically is two frets on
345440	354200	the guitar, and so we'll see a whole step between these, two whole steps, then a half
354200	363160	step, another whole step, another whole step, so all major scales are constructed from a
363160	372000	pattern of whole steps and half steps, and we get whole, whole, half, whole, whole, half,
372000	380960	now this gives us our scale, we have one of each letter name and no repeated letters,
380960	387680	now for the key of C that means that we have just the regular letter names, now if we do
387680	396200	another key, let's take D, we go whole, whole up, E to F is a half step, because remember
396200	405120	there's no E sharp, so I have to make this an F sharp, and I cleverly left myself a space,
405120	410920	alright, now I need a half step, so F sharp to G sure enough is a half step, one fret,
411360	418560	and I keep going, up, here we go again, so B to C is not a whole step, I have to make
418560	429560	this a sharp, to make it a whole step, and then C sharp to D is a half step, so it matches
429560	434720	the pattern, now this is a D major scale, you'll notice again there's one of each letter
434720	441240	name, there's no F and F sharp, there's no C and C sharp, it's just one of each, but
441240	446280	there's some accidentals, there's some sharps, and some keys have sharps and some keys have
446280	455520	flats, now what is often done is we use key signatures, now what's a key signature, well
455520	459960	this is an abbreviated way of describing this scale, so since I know there's going to be
459960	469000	one of each letter name, and I know that there's two sharps, I can just say that the
469000	479800	key of D has this key signature, right there, and if I say okay the key signature for the
479800	486960	key of D is two sharps, F and C, then I know how to make this scale, put one of every letter
486960	494080	name, and I adjust F and C, alright now how does this apply to our friend the circle of
494080	494560	fifths?
