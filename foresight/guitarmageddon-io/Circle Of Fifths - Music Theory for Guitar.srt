00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Alright, today I'm going to do a quick video on the circle of fifths.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,320
Now first off, a few prerequisites.

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,820
This is not an easy topic per se, so I would recommend that if you knew the notes on the guitar,

4
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,200
and one thing you can do, we have a couple of free courses, guitargames.net, there's

5
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:46,400
one on guitar notes, you can go there and do that, you just need to know basically some

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,520
of the names of the notes and how notes work on the instrument, and also I would recommend

7
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,200
knowing what intervals are, and at least half steps and whole steps, which is covered

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,680
in our also free, getting started with music theory, so you might check those out if you

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,600
don't know what those are.

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,320
Alright, now circle of fifths, first of all, I think everyone knows what a circle is, but

11
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,240
you might not know what a fifth is, so let's talk about that.

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:26,360
So a fifth is an interval, and intervals in music work a little funny.

13
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,280
This is how we count.

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:39,240
So first off, you might see, you know, C, D, E, F, G, and that's a fifth, you notice there's

15
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,400
no zero, you might think okay, it goes C to D, that's one, D to E, that's two, but no,

16
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:51,320
it's the number of letter names really that are in the interval, so the distance from

17
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,200
C to G is called the fifth.

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:05,120
Let's do another one, let's say you take G, and you go G, A, B, C, D, that's going to

19
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,640
be a fifth, one, two, three, four, five.

20
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:16,880
On the guitar, you probably recognize this, if you see these two notes played together

21
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:25,800
this is a fifth, you might see this written like F5 or called an F power chord, and if

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:33,680
you can count from most letter names and just count up, so like say D, D, E, F, G, A, gives

23
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,760
you a fifth, there's only one exception to worry about and that's the note B, and the

24
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:46,000
funny thing about B is that it goes up to F sharp, so remember that has to do with the

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,120
fact that there's no B sharp and no E sharp, and both of those are contained within this

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,120
space, so B to F sharp.

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:04,320
Alright now, next, the circle itself, so I took the liberty of pre-drawing my circle,

28
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,720
you should do this on a page, I would practice doing this quite often, and then what we're

29
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:22,880
going to do is basically make a clock, so start here, I kind of divide it up into four

30
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:33,080
spaces and then I put the little ticks in here, and what we're going to do is we're

31
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:41,120
going to start with the note C, and then we're going to go by fifths, so a fifth above C,

32
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:53,120
C, D, E, F, G, and a fifth above G, G, A, B, C, D, and so on and so forth.

33
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:07,840
Here's our B, so we know we go to F sharp and not to F, now at this point you could call

34
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,120
this F sharp and you could also call it G flat because the note that's one above F is

35
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,880
also one below G, so I'm going to switch over to flats and you'll see why in just a little

36
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,480
bit here, and keep going, so G flat, now a fifth above G flat, I'm going to stick with

37
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:35,880
flats, so G flat, A flat, B flat, C flat, D flat, we'll call, okay, and then D flat goes

38
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:47,520
up to A flat, E flat, and we'll keep going here, B flat, F, and then if you've done it

39
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:56,400
correctly, you should get F and then F a fifth up is C, so that means success, now what's

40
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,760
the point of this?

41
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,880
It's a beautiful circle there, but by itself it doesn't really mean much, now the primary

42
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,840
use of the circle is to find key signatures and scales, so let's talk about those real

43
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:19,280
quick, now most of you are probably familiar with what a scale is, it's a collection of

44
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:26,480
notes that fit well together, they're kind of centered around a certain letter, like

45
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:34,400
C scale, the root of it is C and the notes all kind of gravitate towards C, and scales

46
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,480
are constructed using whole steps and half steps, so if you remember back to our prerequisites

47
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:45,440
knowing what those are, it would be good, so a whole step basically is two frets on

48
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:54,200
the guitar, and so we'll see a whole step between these, two whole steps, then a half

49
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:03,160
step, another whole step, another whole step, so all major scales are constructed from a

50
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:12,000
pattern of whole steps and half steps, and we get whole, whole, half, whole, whole, half,

51
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,960
now this gives us our scale, we have one of each letter name and no repeated letters,

52
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,680
now for the key of C that means that we have just the regular letter names, now if we do

53
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:36,200
another key, let's take D, we go whole, whole up, E to F is a half step, because remember

54
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:45,120
there's no E sharp, so I have to make this an F sharp, and I cleverly left myself a space,

55
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,920
alright, now I need a half step, so F sharp to G sure enough is a half step, one fret,

56
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,560
and I keep going, up, here we go again, so B to C is not a whole step, I have to make

57
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:09,560
this a sharp, to make it a whole step, and then C sharp to D is a half step, so it matches

58
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,720
the pattern, now this is a D major scale, you'll notice again there's one of each letter

59
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,240
name, there's no F and F sharp, there's no C and C sharp, it's just one of each, but

60
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,280
there's some accidentals, there's some sharps, and some keys have sharps and some keys have

61
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:35,520
flats, now what is often done is we use key signatures, now what's a key signature, well

62
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,960
this is an abbreviated way of describing this scale, so since I know there's going to be

63
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:49,000
one of each letter name, and I know that there's two sharps, I can just say that the

64
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:59,800
key of D has this key signature, right there, and if I say okay the key signature for the

65
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:06,960
key of D is two sharps, F and C, then I know how to make this scale, put one of every letter

66
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:14,080
name, and I adjust F and C, alright now how does this apply to our friend the circle of

67
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,560
fifths?
