Alright, today I'm going to do a quick video on the circle of fifths.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.320
Now first off, a few prerequisites.

00:25.320 --> 00:32.820
This is not an easy topic per se, so I would recommend that if you knew the notes on the guitar,

00:32.820 --> 00:38.200
and one thing you can do, we have a couple of free courses, guitargames.net, there's

00:38.200 --> 00:46.400
one on guitar notes, you can go there and do that, you just need to know basically some

00:46.400 --> 00:52.520
of the names of the notes and how notes work on the instrument, and also I would recommend

00:52.520 --> 00:58.200
knowing what intervals are, and at least half steps and whole steps, which is covered

00:58.200 --> 01:03.680
in our also free, getting started with music theory, so you might check those out if you

01:03.680 --> 01:06.600
don't know what those are.

01:06.600 --> 01:13.320
Alright, now circle of fifths, first of all, I think everyone knows what a circle is, but

01:13.320 --> 01:18.240
you might not know what a fifth is, so let's talk about that.

01:18.240 --> 01:26.360
So a fifth is an interval, and intervals in music work a little funny.

01:26.360 --> 01:28.280
This is how we count.

01:28.280 --> 01:39.240
So first off, you might see, you know, C, D, E, F, G, and that's a fifth, you notice there's

01:39.240 --> 01:45.400
no zero, you might think okay, it goes C to D, that's one, D to E, that's two, but no,

01:45.400 --> 01:51.320
it's the number of letter names really that are in the interval, so the distance from

01:51.320 --> 01:54.200
C to G is called the fifth.

01:54.200 --> 02:05.120
Let's do another one, let's say you take G, and you go G, A, B, C, D, that's going to

02:05.120 --> 02:09.640
be a fifth, one, two, three, four, five.

02:09.640 --> 02:16.880
On the guitar, you probably recognize this, if you see these two notes played together

02:16.880 --> 02:25.800
this is a fifth, you might see this written like F5 or called an F power chord, and if

02:25.800 --> 02:33.680
you can count from most letter names and just count up, so like say D, D, E, F, G, A, gives

02:33.680 --> 02:38.760
you a fifth, there's only one exception to worry about and that's the note B, and the

02:38.760 --> 02:46.000
funny thing about B is that it goes up to F sharp, so remember that has to do with the

02:46.000 --> 02:51.120
fact that there's no B sharp and no E sharp, and both of those are contained within this

02:51.120 --> 02:55.120
space, so B to F sharp.

02:55.120 --> 03:04.320
Alright now, next, the circle itself, so I took the liberty of pre-drawing my circle,

03:05.080 --> 03:10.720
you should do this on a page, I would practice doing this quite often, and then what we're

03:10.720 --> 03:22.880
going to do is basically make a clock, so start here, I kind of divide it up into four

03:22.880 --> 03:33.080
spaces and then I put the little ticks in here, and what we're going to do is we're

03:33.120 --> 03:41.120
going to start with the note C, and then we're going to go by fifths, so a fifth above C,

03:41.120 --> 03:53.120
C, D, E, F, G, and a fifth above G, G, A, B, C, D, and so on and so forth.

03:53.120 --> 04:07.840
Here's our B, so we know we go to F sharp and not to F, now at this point you could call

04:07.840 --> 04:14.120
this F sharp and you could also call it G flat because the note that's one above F is

04:14.120 --> 04:20.880
also one below G, so I'm going to switch over to flats and you'll see why in just a little

04:20.920 --> 04:26.480
bit here, and keep going, so G flat, now a fifth above G flat, I'm going to stick with

04:26.480 --> 04:35.880
flats, so G flat, A flat, B flat, C flat, D flat, we'll call, okay, and then D flat goes

04:35.880 --> 04:47.520
up to A flat, E flat, and we'll keep going here, B flat, F, and then if you've done it

04:47.560 --> 04:56.400
correctly, you should get F and then F a fifth up is C, so that means success, now what's

04:56.400 --> 04:58.760
the point of this?

04:58.760 --> 05:03.880
It's a beautiful circle there, but by itself it doesn't really mean much, now the primary

05:03.880 --> 05:10.840
use of the circle is to find key signatures and scales, so let's talk about those real

05:10.840 --> 05:19.280
quick, now most of you are probably familiar with what a scale is, it's a collection of

05:19.280 --> 05:26.480
notes that fit well together, they're kind of centered around a certain letter, like

05:26.480 --> 05:34.400
C scale, the root of it is C and the notes all kind of gravitate towards C, and scales

05:34.400 --> 05:40.480
are constructed using whole steps and half steps, so if you remember back to our prerequisites

05:40.480 --> 05:45.440
knowing what those are, it would be good, so a whole step basically is two frets on

05:45.440 --> 05:54.200
the guitar, and so we'll see a whole step between these, two whole steps, then a half

05:54.200 --> 06:03.160
step, another whole step, another whole step, so all major scales are constructed from a

06:03.160 --> 06:12.000
pattern of whole steps and half steps, and we get whole, whole, half, whole, whole, half,

06:12.000 --> 06:20.960
now this gives us our scale, we have one of each letter name and no repeated letters,

06:20.960 --> 06:27.680
now for the key of C that means that we have just the regular letter names, now if we do

06:27.680 --> 06:36.200
another key, let's take D, we go whole, whole up, E to F is a half step, because remember

06:36.200 --> 06:45.120
there's no E sharp, so I have to make this an F sharp, and I cleverly left myself a space,

06:45.120 --> 06:50.920
alright, now I need a half step, so F sharp to G sure enough is a half step, one fret,

06:51.360 --> 06:58.560
and I keep going, up, here we go again, so B to C is not a whole step, I have to make

06:58.560 --> 07:09.560
this a sharp, to make it a whole step, and then C sharp to D is a half step, so it matches

07:09.560 --> 07:14.720
the pattern, now this is a D major scale, you'll notice again there's one of each letter

07:14.720 --> 07:21.240
name, there's no F and F sharp, there's no C and C sharp, it's just one of each, but

07:21.240 --> 07:26.280
there's some accidentals, there's some sharps, and some keys have sharps and some keys have

07:26.280 --> 07:35.520
flats, now what is often done is we use key signatures, now what's a key signature, well

07:35.520 --> 07:39.960
this is an abbreviated way of describing this scale, so since I know there's going to be

07:39.960 --> 07:49.000
one of each letter name, and I know that there's two sharps, I can just say that the

07:49.000 --> 07:59.800
key of D has this key signature, right there, and if I say okay the key signature for the

07:59.800 --> 08:06.960
key of D is two sharps, F and C, then I know how to make this scale, put one of every letter

08:06.960 --> 08:14.080
name, and I adjust F and C, alright now how does this apply to our friend the circle of

08:14.080 --> 08:14.560
fifths?
