Checking Welch Labs/Imaginary Numbers Are Real [Part 1ï¼š Introduction].txt
The text you provided discusses the concept of imaginary (or lateral, as suggested by Gauss) numbers and their importance in understanding polynomial equations, particularly the quadratic equation \( f(x) = x^2 + 1 \). The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every non-constant single-variable polynomial with complex coefficients has as many complex roots as its degree. For a quadratic equation like the one given, this means there should be two roots.

The apparent contradiction arises when we graph \( f(x) = x^2 + 1 \), which shows a parabola that does not intersect the x-axis, suggesting it has no real solutions. However, due to the existence of imaginary numbers, we know there must be two complex solutions. These solutions are the complex numbers \( i \) and \( -i \), where \( i \) is the imaginary unit defined by the property that \( i^2 = -1 \).

The historical context of how humans came to understand and accept negative and imaginary numbers is also discussed. Early humans used natural numbers, which were later supplemented by fractions, zero, and negative numbers. These innovations allowed for more sophisticated calculations and mathematical understanding.

Imaginary numbers represent a further extension of the number system and were initially met with skepticism. Over time, as mathematicians recognized their utility in solving equations and describing phenomena in physics, engineering, and other fields, they became accepted.

In summary, the parabola \( y = x^2 + 1 \) does indeed have two roots, which are the complex numbers \( i \) and \( -i \). These roots demonstrate the power and completeness of the complex number system, which resolves the apparent contradiction between our graphical representation and the fundamental theorem of algebra.

Checking Welch Labs/The moment we stopped understanding AI [AlexNet].txt
1. **AlexNet and Scale**: The success of AlexNet in the ImageNet challenge in 2012 was largely due to the scale of data (over 1.3 million images) and compute (GPUs providing roughly 10,000 times more power than previous systems like Lacoon's LayNet 5). AlexNet had around 60 million parameters compared to Lacoon's 60,000 parameters.

2. **Historical Context**: The idea of artificial neural networks dates back to the 1940s with McCulloch and Pitts neurons, which were further developed into perceptrons in the 1950s. These models were refined through the 80s and 90s, but were not the dominant approach in AI due to perceived difficulties in training them.

3. **Deep Learning Breakthrough**: AlexNet's success was a breakthrough that demonstrated the effectiveness of deep neural networks when scaled appropriately with data and compute. This led to the third wave of AI we see today, characterized by large models with trillions of parameters.

4. **AI Development Unpredictability**: It's challenging to predict the next AI breakthrough, whether it will be another scaling up of current methods or a resurfacing of an older approach. The field is rapidly evolving and has been unpredictable.

5. **Simplicity of Compute Blocks**: The compute blocks in neural networks, despite being simple, can perform complex tasks due to the power of the underlying algorithms and the massive amount of data they are trained on. Calling these blocks "dumb" is a testament to their simplicity and effectiveness when combined with sophisticated learning processes.

6. **Understanding AI Models**: While we understand that models like AlexNet and ChatGPT learn representations of known concepts, there are many more concepts these models learn whose implications and workings we may not fully grasp due to the high dimensionality of their neural networks.

In summary, the success of AlexNet in 2012 was a surprise that demonstrated the potential of deep learning, which has since led to the current era of AI characterized by large-scale models with unprecedented capabilities. The future of AI remains uncertain, but it will likely continue to evolve based on both incremental improvements and potentially revolutionary new approaches.
