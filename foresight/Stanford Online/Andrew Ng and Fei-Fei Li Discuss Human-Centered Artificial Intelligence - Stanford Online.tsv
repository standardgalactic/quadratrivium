0	12800	Hi. I'm delighted to have with us here today my old friend Professor Fei Fei Li. Fei Fei
12800	18640	is a professor of computer science at Stanford University and also co-director of HAI, the
18640	25880	Human-Centered AI Institute. And previously, she also was responsible for AI at Google
25880	29960	Cloud as a chief scientist for the division. It's great to have you here, Fei Fei.
29960	32240	Thank you, Andrew. Very happy to be here.
32240	36000	So, I guess, actually, how long have you known each other? I've lost track.
36000	41680	Definitely more than a decade. I mean, I've known your work, right, before we even met.
41680	50560	And I came to Stanford 2009, but we started talking 2007, so 15 years.
50560	56640	And I can still have very clear memories of how stressful it was when, collectively,
56640	60720	you know, a bunch of us, me, Chris Manning, a bunch of us, were trying to figure out how
60720	62960	to recruit you to come to Stanford.
62960	70120	It wasn't hard. I just needed to sort out my students and life, but it's hard to resist
70120	71120	Stanford.
71120	74440	It wasn't really great having you as a friend and colleague here.
74440	81480	Yeah, me too. It's been a long time. And we're very lucky to be the generation seeing
81480	83120	AI is great progress.
83120	88720	Okay, so there was something about your background that always found inspiring, which is, you
88720	94560	know, today people are entering AI from all walks of life. And sometimes people still wonder,
94560	100720	oh, I majored in something or other. Is AI a right path for me? So I thought one of the
100720	104120	most interesting parts of your background was that you actually started out not studying
104120	109560	computer science or AI, but you started out studying physics and then had this path to
109560	114880	becoming, you know, one of the most globally recognizable AI scientists. So how did you
114880	117480	make that switch from physics to AI?
117480	122120	Right. Well, that's a great question, Andrew, especially both of us are passionate about
122120	130320	young people's future and their coming to the world of AI. The truth is, if I could
130320	136720	enter AI back then more than 20 years ago, today, anybody can enter AI because AI has
136720	147120	become such a prevalent and globally impactful technology. But myself, maybe I was an accident.
147120	155760	So I have always been a physics kid or STEM kids. I'm sure you were too. But physics was
155760	161240	my passion all the way through, you know, middle school, high school, college. I went
161240	168120	to Princeton and majored in physics. And one thing physics has taught me till today is
168120	175720	really the passion for asking big questions, the passion for seeking North stars. And I
175720	181400	was really having fun as a physics student at Princeton. And one thing I did was reading
181480	189760	up stories and just writings of great physicists of the 20th century and just hear about what
189760	196760	they think about, you know, the world, especially people like Albert Einstein, Roger Penrose,
196760	205720	you know, Erring Schrodinger. And it was really funny to notice that many of the writings
205720	212360	towards the later half of the career of these great physicists were not about just the atomic
212360	221600	world or the physical world, but pondering about equally audacious questions like life,
221600	226440	like intelligence, like human conditions. You know, Schrodinger wrote this book, What
226440	236400	Is Life? And Roger Penrose wrote this book, Emperor's New Mind, right? And that really
236400	243200	got me very curious about the topic of intelligence. So one thing led to another during college
243200	251800	time, I did the intern at a couple of neuroscience labs, and especially vision related. And I
251800	259120	was like, wow, this is just as audacious a question to ask as the beginning of the universe,
259120	266880	or what is matter made of. And that got me to switch from undergraduate degree in physics
266880	274960	to graduate degree in AI, even though I don't know about you, during our time, AI was a
274960	281520	dirty word. It was AI winter, so it was more machine learning and computer vision and computation
281520	286080	on neuroscience. Yeah, I know. Honestly, I think when when I was in undergrad, I was
286080	291840	too busy writing code, I just, you know, managed to blithely ignore the AI winter and just kept
291840	296760	on coding. Yeah, well, I was too busy solving PDE equations.
296760	304960	And so actually, do you do you have an audacious question now? Yes, my audacious question is
304960	312760	still intelligence. I think since Alan Turing, humanity has not fully understand what is
312760	321600	the fundamental computing principles behind intelligence. You know, we, we, we today we
321600	328200	use the words AI, we use the word AGI. But at the end of the day, I still dream of a
328280	335680	set of simple equations or simple principles that can define the process of intelligence,
335680	342520	whether it's animal intelligence or machine intelligence. And this is similar to physics.
342520	349520	For example, many people have joined the analogy of flying, right? Are we replicating birds
349520	355000	flying, or are we building an airplane? And a lot of people ask the question of the relationship
355040	363800	between AI and brain. And to me, whether we're building a bird or replicating a bird or building
363800	371280	an airplane, at the end of the day, aerodynamics and physics that govern the process of flying.
371280	376760	And I do believe one day we'll discover that. I sometimes think about this, you know, one
376760	381480	learning algorithm hypothesis, could a lot of intelligence, maybe not all, but a lot of
381560	387440	it be explained by one or a very simple machine learning principles. And it feels like we're
387440	392840	still so far from cracking that nut. But in the weekends, when I have spare time, when
392840	395960	I think about learning algorithms and where they could go, this is one of the things I
395960	398560	still, you know, I'm excited about, right, just thinking about.
398560	406160	I totally agree. I still feel like we are pre Newtonian. If we're doing physics analogy
406160	412560	before Newton, there has been great physics, great physicists, a lot of phenomenology, a
412560	419200	lot of studies of how the astrobodies move and all that. But it was Newton who start to
419200	425920	write the very simple laws. And I think we are still going to that very exciting coming
425920	433000	of age of AI as a basic science. And we're pre Newton, in my opinion.
433320	437320	It's really nice to hear you talk about how despite machine learning and AI having come so
437320	443000	far, it still feels like there are a lot more unanswered questions, a lot more work to be done
443000	447560	by maybe some of the people joining the field today than work that's already been done.
447560	453800	Absolutely. I mean, let's let's calculate. It's only what 60 years about. It's a very
453800	461720	nascent field modern his physics and chemistry and biology are all hundreds of years. Right. So
461720	470440	I think it is very, it is very exciting to be entering the field of science of intelligence
471080	478120	and studying AI today. Yeah, I think I remember chatting with the late Professor John McCarthy
478120	483800	who had coined the term artificial intelligence. And boy, the field has changed since when,
483800	490600	you know, he conceived of it at the workshop and came up the term AI. But maybe another 10 years
490600	495080	from now, you know, maybe someone watching this will come up with a new set of ideas.
495080	499320	And then we'll be saying, boy, AI sure is different than what you know,
499320	502600	you and I thought it would be. That's an exciting future to build towards.
502600	509720	Yeah, I'm sure Newton would have not dreamed of Einstein. So, you know, our evolution of science
510520	517720	sometimes takes strides, sometimes takes a while. And I think we're absolutely in an exciting phase
517720	525080	of AI right now. You know, it's interesting hearing you paint this grand vision for AI.
526120	529720	Going back a little bit, there was one other piece of your background that I found, you know,
531080	536360	inspiring, which is when you're just getting started, I've heard you speak about how,
537240	541880	you know, you're a physics student, but not only that, you also you're also running a laundromat
542440	547400	to pay for school. And so just tell us more about that.
549720	557160	So I came to this country, to New Jersey, actually, when I was 15. And one thing great
557160	563560	about being in New Jersey is it was close to Princeton. So I often just take a weekend trip
563560	570440	with my parents and to admire the place where Einstein spent most of his career in the latter
570440	578120	half of his life. But, you know, with typical immigrant life, and it was tough. And by the time
578120	586280	I entered Princeton, my parents didn't speak English. And one thing led to another, it turns out
586280	592600	running a dry cleaner might be the best option for my family, especially for me to lead that
592600	598040	business because it's a weekend business. If it's a weekday business, it would be hard for me to be
598040	605480	a student. And it's actually, believe it or not, running a dry cleaning shop is very machine heavy,
605480	613960	which is good for a STEM student like me. So we decided to open a dry cleaner shop in
614920	622040	a small town in New Jersey called Persephone, New Jersey. It turned out we were physically not too
622040	629560	far from Bell Labs and where lots of early convolutional neural network research was
629560	635800	happening, but I had no idea. Actually, a summer intern at the AT&T Bell Labs way back.
635800	641800	That's right, with Rob Shapiro. With Michael Curran was my mentor. And Rob Shapiro invented
641800	648120	boosting great algorithms. So your coding AI, I was trying to cling to. No, that was only much
648200	657240	later in my life. Did I start interrunning? Yeah. And then it was seven years. I did that for
657880	662280	the entire undergrad and most of my grad school and I hired my parents.
664280	669960	Yeah, no, that's really inspiring. I know you've been brilliant at doing exciting work all your
669960	676120	life. And I think the story of running a laundromat to globally prominent computer scientists,
676120	681960	I hope that inspires some people watching this that no matter where you are, there's plenty
681960	688600	of room for young everyone. Don't even notice, my high school job was an office admin.
690600	695720	And so to this day, I remember doing a lot of photocopying. And the exciting part was using
695720	700600	this shredder. That was a glamorous one. But I was doing so much photocopying in high school,
700600	705800	I thought, boy, if only I could build a robot to do this photocopying, maybe I could do something
706360	714920	Did you succeed? I'm still working on it. We'll see. And then when people think about
714920	721880	you and the work you've done, one of the huge successes everyone thinks about is ImageNet,
721880	726840	where Hub established early benchmark for computer vision. It was really completely
726840	731960	instrumental to the modern rise of deep learning in computer vision. One thing I
731960	736120	bet not many people know about is how you actually got started on ImageNet.
736120	743080	So tell us the origin story of ImageNet. Yeah, well, Andrew, that's a good question,
743080	749640	because a lot of people see ImageNet as just labeling a ton of images. But where we began
749640	755640	was really going after a North Star, brings back my physics background. So when I entered
755640	761960	grad school, when did you enter grad school? Which year? 97. Okay, I was three years later
761960	770280	than you, 2000. And that was a very exciting period, because I was in the computer vision
770280	776200	and computational neuroscience lab of Pietro Peronna and Christoph Koch at Caltech. And
776200	783480	leading up to that, there has been, first of all, two things was very exciting. One is that the world
784120	789400	AI at that point wasn't called AI, computer vision or natural language processing,
789400	796920	has found its lingua de franco, its machine learning, statistical modeling as a new tool
796920	802760	has emerged, right? I mean, it's been around. And I remember when the idea of applying machine
802760	807720	learning to computer vision, that was like a controversial thing. Right, and I was the first
807800	813400	generation of graduate students who were embracing all the base net, all the inference
813400	821560	algorithms and all that. And that was one exciting happening. A second exciting happening that
822520	828680	most people don't know and don't appreciate, is that a couple of decades, probably more than
828680	835320	two or three decades of incredible cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience work
835320	841080	in the field of vision, in the world of vision, human vision, that has really established a couple
841080	847000	of really critical north star problems, just understanding human visual processing and human
847000	853320	intelligence. And one of them is the recognition of understanding of natural objects and natural
853320	859880	things, because a lot of the psychology and cognitive science work is pointing to us,
860520	869160	that is an innately optimized, whatever that word is, functionality and ability of human
869160	880600	intelligence. It's more robust, faster and more nuanced than we had thought. We even find neural
880600	891160	correlates, brain areas devoted to faces or places or body parts. So these two things led to my PhD
891160	901000	study of using machine learning methods to work on real-world object recognition. But it became
901000	908680	very painful, very quickly, that we are coming, banging against one of the most,
910600	916840	continue to be the most important challenge in AI and machine learning is the lack of
916840	925960	generalizability. You can design a beautiful model all you want if you're overfitting that model.
926520	931400	I remember when it used to be possible to publish a computer vision paper showing your
931400	939320	works on one image. Exactly. Yeah, it's just the overfitting, the models are not very expressive
939880	950040	and we lack the data. And we also, as a field, was betting on making the variables very rich by
950600	956760	hand-engineered features. Remember, every variable carrying a ton of semantic meaning,
956760	965800	but with hand-engineered features. And then towards the end of my PhD, my advisor,
965800	972600	Pietro and I start to look at each other and say, well, boy, we need more data. If we believe in
972600	979160	this North Star problem of object recognition, and we look back at the tools we have,
980120	985800	mathematically speaking, we're overfitting every model we're encountering. We need to take a fresh
985800	992520	look at this. So one thing led to another. He and I decided we'll just do a, at that point,
992520	998920	we think it was a large-scale data project called Caltech 101. I remember the data set. I wrote
998920	1004520	papers using your Caltech 101 data set way back. You did. You and your early graduate student.
1004520	1010040	It helped benefit a lot of researchers. Yeah. Caltech 101 data set. That was me and my mom
1010040	1017560	labeling images on a couple of undergrads. But that was, it was the early days of internet.
1017560	1024280	So suddenly the availability of data was a new thing. You suddenly, I remember Pietro still
1024280	1030760	have this super expensive digital camera. I think it was Canon or something like $6,000
1031560	1038680	walking around Caltech taking pictures. But we are the internet generation. I go to Google
1038680	1043800	Image Search. I start to see these thousands and tens of thousands of images. And I tell Pietro,
1043800	1049480	let's just download. Of course, it's all that easy to download. So one thing led to another.
1049480	1057080	We built this Caltech 101 data set of 101 object categories. And about, I would say,
1057080	1063080	30 to 50, 30,000 pictures. I think it's really interesting that,
1064040	1069800	you know, even though everyone's heard of ImageNet today, even you kind of took a couple
1069800	1074440	of iterations where you did Caltech 101. And that was a success. Lots of people used it.
1074440	1079640	But it's the, even the early learnings from building Caltech 101 that gave you the basis to
1079640	1087000	build what turned out to be even, an even bigger success. Right. Except that by the time we start,
1087000	1092920	I became an assistant professor. We started to look at the problem. I realized it's way
1092920	1098760	bigger than we think. Just mathematically speaking, Caltech 101 was not sufficient to,
1098760	1105800	to power the, the algorithms. We decided to image, to do ImageNet. And that was the time people
1105800	1112600	start to think we're, we're doing too much. Right. It's, it's just too crazy. The idea of
1112600	1120200	downloading the entire Internet of images and mapping out all the English nouns was a little bit,
1121560	1127240	I start to get a lot of pushback. I remember at one of the CVPR conference when I presented the
1127240	1135000	early idea of ImageNet, a couple of researchers publicly questioned and said, said, if you cannot
1135000	1142120	recognize one category of object, let's say the chair you're sitting in, how do you imagine,
1142120	1150360	or what's the use of a dataset of 22,000 classes of 15 million images? Yeah. But, but in the end,
1150360	1155640	you know, that giant dataset unlocked a lot of value for, you know, countless number of
1155640	1160280	researchers around the world. So that, so that works. Well, I, I think it was the combination
1160280	1168760	of betting on the right North Star problem and the data that drives it. So it was a fun process.
1168760	1175240	Yeah. And, and, you know, to me, one of the, when I think about that story, it seems like one of
1175240	1181400	those examples where, you know, sometimes people feel like they should only work on projects without
1181400	1187160	the huge thing at the first outset, but I feel like for people working in machine learning,
1187160	1192280	if your first project is a bit smaller, it's totally fine. Have a good win, use the learnings
1192280	1197080	to build up to even bigger things. And then sometimes you get a, you know, ImageNet size win,
1197080	1204280	all of it. Yeah. Well, but in the meantime, I think it's also important to be driven by
1205080	1212040	an audacious goal, though, you know, you can size your problem or size your project as local
1212040	1219880	milestones and, and, and so on along this journey. But I also look at some of our current students,
1219880	1229080	they're so peer pressured by this current climate of publishing nonstop. It becomes more incremental
1229080	1237000	papers to just get into a publication for the sake of it. And I, I personally always push my
1237000	1241480	students to ask the question, what is the North Star that's driving you? Yeah, that's true. Yeah.
1242200	1245560	And you're right. You know, for myself, when I do research over the years, I've always
1246280	1252200	pretty much done what I'm excited about, where I want to, you know, try to push the view forward.
1252200	1256200	Doesn't it don't listen to people, have to listen to people, let them shape your opinion. But in
1256200	1261080	the end, I think the best research is, let the world shape their opinion. But in the end,
1261080	1265400	drive things forward using their own opinion. Totally agree. Yeah. It's your own inner fire,
1265400	1272840	right? So as your research program developed, you've wound up taking your, let's say, foundations
1272840	1279240	in computer vision and neuroscience and applying to all sorts of topics, including your very visibly
1279240	1284680	healthcare, looking at neuroscience applications. Would love to hear a bit more about that.
1284680	1291320	Yeah, happy to. I think the evolution of my research in computer vision also kind of follows
1291320	1298360	the evolution of visual intelligence in animals. And there are two topics that truly excites me.
1298360	1306200	One is, what is a truly impactful application area that would help human lives? And that's my
1306200	1314280	healthcare work. The other one is, what is vision at the end of the day about? And that brings me to
1315640	1322840	the, trying to close the loop between perception and robotic learning. So on the healthcare side,
1324600	1331000	you know, one thing, Andrew, there was a number that shocked me about 10 years ago when I met
1331000	1338120	my long-term collaborator, Dr. Arnie Milstein at Stanford Medical School. And that number is about
1338120	1348120	a quarter of a million Americans die of medical errors every year. I had never imagined a number
1348120	1356360	being that high due to medical errors. There are many, many reasons, but we can rest assured most
1356360	1364760	of the reasons are not intentional. These are her errors of unintended mistakes and so on.
1364760	1370520	For example? That's a mind-boggling number. I think it's made about 40,000 deaths a year from
1370520	1374280	automotive accidents, which is completely tragic. And this is even vastly tragic.
1374280	1380120	I was going to say that. I'm glad you brought it up. Just one example, one number within that
1380120	1387080	mind-boggling number is the number of hospital-acquired infection resulted in fatality is
1387880	1399160	more than 95,000. That's 2.5 times than the death of car accidents. And in this particular case,
1399160	1406200	hospital-acquired infection is a result of many things, but in large, a lack of good
1406200	1413560	hand hygiene practice. So if you look at WHO, there has been a lot of protocols about clinicians'
1413560	1422120	hand hygiene practice. But in real healthcare delivery, when things get busy and when the
1422120	1427640	process is tedious and when there is a lack of feedback system, you still make a lot of mistakes.
1428280	1436680	Another tragic medical fact is that more than $70 billion every year are spent in
1437640	1443880	in fall resulted injuries and fatalities. And most of this happened to elderlies at home,
1443880	1450040	but also in the hospital rooms. And these are huge issues. And when Arnie and I got together
1450680	1459720	back in 2012, it was the height of a self-driving car, let's say not hype, but what's the word,
1459960	1467640	right word, excitement in Silicon Valley. And then we look at the technology of smart sensing
1467640	1474280	cameras, LiDARs, radars, whatever, smart sensors, machine learning algorithm,
1474280	1481960	and holistic understanding of a complex environment with high stakes for human lives.
1482920	1488760	I was looking at all that for self-driving car and realized in healthcare delivery,
1489560	1496680	we have the same situation. Much of the process, the human behavior process of healthcare is in
1496680	1505320	the dark. And if we could have smart sensors, be it in patient rooms or senior homes, to help our
1505320	1511640	clinicians and patients to stay safer, that would be amazing. So Arnie and I embarked on this,
1511720	1518440	what we call ambient intelligence research agenda. But one thing I learned, which probably will lead
1518440	1528040	to our other topics, is as soon as you're applying AI to real human conditions, there's a lot of human
1528040	1533800	issues in addition to machine learning issues. For example, privacy. And I remember reading some
1533800	1538200	of your papers with Arnie and found it really interesting how you could build and deploy
1538200	1545560	systems that were relatively privacy preserving. Yeah, well, thank you. Well, the first iteration
1545560	1552120	of that technology is we use cameras that do not capture RGB information. You've used a lot of that
1552120	1558840	in self-driving cars, the depth cameras, for example. And there you preserve a lot of privacy
1560360	1565960	information just by not seeing the faces and the identity of the people. But what's really
1566040	1573080	interesting over the past decade is the changes of technology is actually giving us a bigger tool set
1573080	1581320	for privacy preserved computing in this condition. For example, on device inference,
1581960	1587080	you know, as the chip's getting more and more powerful, if you don't have to transmit any data
1587080	1592760	through the network and to the central server, you help people better. Federated learning,
1592760	1600520	we know it's still early stage, but that's another potential tool for privacy preserved computing
1600520	1607320	and then differential privacy and also encryption technologies. So we're starting to see
1607960	1614840	that human demand, you know, privacy and other issues is driving actually a new wave of machine
1614840	1620440	learning technology in ambient intelligence in healthcare. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, I've been
1620440	1626440	encouraged to see the, you know, real practical applications of differential privacy that are
1626440	1631320	actually real. Federated learning, as you said, probably the PR is a little bit ahead of the
1631320	1636120	reality, but I think we'll get there. But it's interesting how consumers in the last several
1636120	1641160	years have fortunately gotten much more knowledgeable about privacy and are increasingly
1641640	1646360	so important. I think the public is also making us to be better scientists.
1647080	1652840	Yeah, yeah. And I think, and I think ultimately, you know, people understanding AI holds everyone,
1652840	1659080	including us, but holds everyone accountable for really doing the right thing. Yeah, yeah. And,
1659080	1664920	you know, and on that note, one of the really interesting pieces of work you've been doing has
1664920	1673320	been leading several efforts to help educate legislators or help governments, especially U.S.
1673320	1678920	government, work towards better laws and better regulation, especially as it relates to AI.
1680200	1684520	This sounds like very important. And I suspect some days of the week,
1684520	1687560	I would get somewhat frustrating work, but we'd love to hear more about that.
1688360	1695560	Yeah, so I think first of all, I have to credit many, many people. So about four years ago,
1695560	1701640	and I was actually finishing my sabbatical from Google time, I was very privileged to work with
1701640	1711880	so many businesses, you know, enterprise developers, just just a large number and variety of vertical
1711880	1720280	industries and realizing AI's human impact. And that was when many faculty leaders at Stanford
1720280	1726040	and also just our president provost, former president and former provost all get together
1726200	1734360	realize there is a role, historical role that Stanford needs to play in the advances of AI.
1734360	1742600	We were part of the part of the birthplace of AI, you know, a lot of work our previous
1743240	1749000	generation have done and a lot of work you've done and some of our work I've done led to AI,
1749000	1758360	today's AI, what is our historical opportunity and responsibility? With that, we believe that the
1758360	1764440	next generation of AI education and research and policy needs to be human centered. And
1765240	1773240	having established the Human Center Institute, what we call HAI, one of the work that really took me
1773240	1783480	outside of my comfort zone or any expertise, is really a deeper engagement with policy thinkers
1783480	1788920	and makers. Because, you know, we're here in Silicon Valley and there is a culture in Silicon
1788920	1795720	Valley is we just keep making things and the law will catch up by itself. But AI is impacting human
1795720	1806440	lives and sometimes negatively so rapidly that it is not good for any of us if we the experts
1807080	1812760	are not at the table with the policy thinkers and makers to really try to make this technology
1812760	1816920	better for the people. I mean, we're talking about fairness, we're talking about privacy.
1817640	1827080	We also are talking about the brain drain of AI to industry and the concentration of data and
1827080	1836600	compute in a small number of technology companies. All these are really part of the changes of our
1836600	1843240	time. Some are really exciting changes, some have profound impact that we cannot necessarily
1843880	1851160	predict yet. So one of the policy work that Stanford HAI has very proudly engaged in is
1851160	1859000	we were the one of the leading universities that lobbied a bill called the National AI Research
1859000	1865720	Cloud Task Force Bill. It changed the name from Research Cloud to Research Resource. So now the
1865720	1872680	bill's acronym is NAIR, National AI Research Resource. And this bill is calling for a task force
1873480	1880200	to put together a roadmap for America's public sector, especially higher education and research
1881480	1890280	sector to increase their access to resource for AI compute and AI data. It really is
1890360	1899800	aimed to rejuvenate America's ecosystem in AI innovation and research. And I'm on the 12-person
1899800	1907640	task force for under Biden administration for this bill. And we hope that's a piece of policy that
1908520	1916120	is not a regulatory policy, it's more an incentive policy to build and rejuvenate ecosystems.
1916120	1921320	I'm glad that you're doing this to help shape U.S. policy and this type of making sure enough
1921320	1927160	resources allocated to ensure healthy development of AI feels like this is something that every
1927160	1935000	country needs at this point. So just from the things that you are doing by yourself, not to
1935000	1940520	speak of the things that the global AI community is doing, there's just so much going on in AI
1940520	1946520	right now. So many opportunities, so much excitement. I found that for someone getting
1946520	1950280	started in machine learning for the first time, sometimes there's so much going on,
1950280	1957240	it can almost be a little bit overwhelming. What advice do you have for someone getting
1957240	1963640	started in machine learning? Good question, Andrew. I'm sure you have great advice. You're one of the
1963640	1970600	world-known advocates for AI machine learning education, so I do get this question a lot as
1970600	1976920	well. And one thing you're totally right is AI really today feels different from our time.
1977960	1984520	During our time... Just further, I thought, now is still our time. That's true, when we were
1985400	1993160	starting in AI. I love that, exactly. We're still part of this. When we get started,
1993240	2000120	entrance to AI and machine learning was relatively narrow. You almost have to start from computer
2000120	2007560	science and go. As a physics major, I still had to wedge myself into the computer science track
2007560	2014840	or electrical engineering track to get to AI. But today, I actually think that there is a
2014920	2021880	remaining aspect of AI that creates entry points for people from all walks of life.
2023000	2031560	On the technical side, I think it's obvious that there's just an incredible plethora of
2031560	2038280	resources out there on the internet, from Coursera to YouTube to TikTok to GitHub.
2039240	2046280	There's just so much that students worldwide can learn about AI and machine learning compared
2046280	2052360	to the time we began learning machine learning. And also, any campuses, we're not talking about
2052360	2059080	just college campuses. We're talking about high school campuses. Even sometimes earlier, we're
2059080	2069640	starting to see more available classes and resources. I do encourage those of the young
2069640	2077960	people with a technical interest and resource and opportunity to embrace these resources,
2077960	2085640	because it's a lot of fun. But having said that, for those of you who are not coming from a technical
2085640	2091960	angle, who still are passionate about AI, whether it's the downstream application or
2091960	2100520	the creativity it engenders, or the policy and social angle or important social problems,
2100520	2109480	whether it's digital economics or the governance or history, ethics, political sciences,
2110200	2118280	there, I do invite you to join us, because there is a lot of work to be done. There's a lot of
2120040	2127480	unknown questions. For example, my colleague at HAI are questioning, are trying to find answers on,
2127480	2136040	how do you define our economy in the digital age? What does it mean when robots and software
2136200	2144040	are participating in the workflow more and more? How do you measure our economy? That's not an AI
2144040	2150520	coding question. That is an AI impact question. We're looking at the incredible advances of
2150520	2157960	generative AI, and there will be more. What does that mean for creativity and to the creators,
2157960	2166760	from music to art to writing? There is a lot of concerns, and I think it's rightfully so,
2166760	2174040	but in the meantime, it takes people together to figure this out, and also to use this new tool.
2176280	2182360	In short, I just think it's a very exciting time, and anybody with any walks of life,
2183000	2185960	as long as you're passionate about this, there's a role to play.
2186680	2190760	Yeah, and that's really exciting. We're going to talk about economics, think about my conversations
2190760	2197720	with Professor Eric Brynoson, studying the impact of AI on the economy. From what you're saying,
2197720	2204840	and I agree, it seems like no matter what your current interests are, AI is such a general purpose
2204840	2212120	technology that the combination of your current interests and AI is often promising. I find that
2212120	2217880	even for learners that may not yet have a specific interest, if you find your way into AI,
2217880	2223720	start learning things, often the interests will evolve, and then you can start to craft your own
2223720	2230200	path. And given where AI is today, there's still so much room and so much need for a lot more people
2230200	2236040	to craft their own paths to do this exciting work that I think the world still needs a lot more of.
2236040	2240760	Totally agree, yeah. So, one piece of work that you did that I thought was very cool was starting
2240760	2246520	a program, initially called Sailors, and then later AI for all, which was really reaching out
2246520	2252200	to high school and even younger students to try to give them more opportunities in AI,
2252200	2255880	including people of all walks of life. We'd love to hear more about that.
2255880	2266280	Yeah, well, this is in the spirit of this conversation. That was back in 2015. There was
2266360	2272520	starting to be a lot of excitement of AI, but there was also starting to be this talk about
2273800	2280120	killer robot coming next door, terminators coming. And I was, at that time, Andrew,
2281080	2287800	I was the director of Steveria Lab, and I was thinking, you know, we know how far we are from
2287800	2293400	terminators coming, and that seemed to be a really a little bit of far-fetched concern,
2293480	2299320	but I was living my work life with a real concern I felt no one was talking about,
2299320	2305080	which was the lack of representation in AI. At that time, I guess after Daphne has left,
2305080	2315000	I was the only woman faculty at Steveria Lab, and we're having very small, around 15% of women
2315000	2322040	graduate students, and we really don't see anybody from the underrepresented minority groups
2322040	2330280	in Stanford AI program, and this is a national or even worldwide issue, so it wasn't just Stanford.
2330280	2335800	Frankly, it still needs a lot of work today. Exactly. So how do we do this? Well, I got together
2335800	2345000	with my former student Olga Rosakowski and also a long-term educator of STEM topics,
2345000	2352520	Dr. Rick Sommer from a Stanford pre-collegiate study program, and thought about inviting
2352520	2358920	high schoolers at that time, women, high school young women, to participate in a summer program
2358920	2368360	to inspire them to learn AI, and that was how it started in 2015 and 2017. We got a lot of
2368360	2374760	encouragement and support from people like Jensen and Laurie Huang and Melinda Gates,
2374760	2381960	and we formed the National Nonprofit AI for All, which is really committed to training or
2383480	2391240	helping tomorrow's leaders, shaping tomorrow's leaders for AI from students of all walks of
2391240	2396840	life, especially the traditionally underserved and underrepresented communities, and
2397800	2405480	you know, till today, we've had many, many summer camps and summer programs across the country. More
2405480	2416120	than 15 universities are involved, and we have online curriculum to encourage students as well as
2416120	2423720	college pathway programs to continue support these students' career by matching them with
2423720	2430760	internships and mentors, so it's a it's a continued effort of encouraging students of all walks of
2430760	2435880	life. And I remember back then, I think your group was printing these really cool t-shirts that
2435880	2442040	asked the question, AI will change the world, who will change AI, and I thought the answer of
2442040	2447640	making sure everyone can come in and participate, that was a great answer. Yeah, still an important
2447640	2455080	question today. So that's a great thought, and I think that takes us to the end of the interview.
2456120	2463000	Any final thoughts for people watching this? Still, that this is a very nascent field.
2463000	2468280	As you said, Andrew, we are still in the middle of this. I still feel there's just so many questions
2468280	2474920	that, you know, I wake up excited to work on with my students in the lab, and I think there's a lot
2474920	2481080	more opportunities for the young people out there who want to learn and contribute and shape
2481080	2488040	tomorrow's AI. Well said, that's very inspiring. Really great to chat with you, and thank you.
2488040	2501160	Thank you, it's fun to have these conversations.
