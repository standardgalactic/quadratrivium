0	19000	So this is E380 for May 10th, 2023.
19000	27000	And our speaker is Ken Kahn, who is retired in Oxford after being at Oxford.
27000	32000	And soon we'll be back at Oxford.
32000	40000	Ken was back in the Dark Ages at Xerox Park for a bit.
40000	48000	And there he worked on a project which became a lifetime session, I guess,
48000	53000	called Toon Talk, which was the first really configurable, programmable
53000	55000	animation system.
55000	63000	And in its day, golly, I hate to think of how long ago it was.
63000	67000	It was really the most amazing thing.
67000	73000	And rather than go the commercial route and build video games,
73000	80000	it can keep poking away at the methodology and the underlying structures
80000	86000	of which you tell stories through pictures and voice.
86000	92000	He recently did some work collaborating with the chat GPT-4.
92000	99000	And unlike a lot of people who looked at it as using it as a tool,
99000	107000	he appears to believe, as I do, that chat GPT-4 is just another programming
107000	113000	companion, a worker, a colleague, and used it in a very interesting way.
113000	119000	So I'm going to let you go on from there and feel free, by the way,
119000	123000	if you're in the audience, to interrupt with questions and so forth.
123000	131000	And if it gets to be a diversionary thing, we'll either accept it or not.
131000	133000	Go on, Ken.
133000	135000	Good.
135000	143000	Let me move this.
143000	145000	The Zoom stuff was sort of in the way.
145000	147000	All right.
147000	151000	Thanks, everybody, for coming and feel free to interrupt,
151000	154000	ask questions at any time.
154000	160000	And this is what I'll be talking about is some experiments I've done trying
160000	164000	to create apps, just having conversations with a language model.
164000	167000	But first, maybe I'll give you a tiny bit of background.
167000	173000	So I was doing good old-fashioned AI for about 20 years first at the MIT
173000	176000	Lab and then Sir Ox Park and so on.
176000	180000	And then I got into the idea of creating a programming language for
180000	183000	children that was completely based around animation.
183000	186000	There was no text involved.
186000	191000	And then in the middle of that, I also got involved in Oxford,
191000	197000	in a big project trying to make it possible for
197000	201000	people to make agent-based simulations of, you know,
201000	206000	epidemics or ant colonies or whatever.
206000	212000	And then I got involved in 2016 in a big European research project where my
212000	218000	role was to make it possible for the students, and these were 11 to 14
218000	223000	world to be able to incorporate machine learning in their projects.
223000	228000	So I built upon the SNAP programming language, which is more adult version
228000	236000	of Scratch, and added lots of blocks for doing computer vision or
236000	243000	natural language processing or to be even able to just create
243000	246000	neural networks and train them right there in the browser.
246000	252000	And that was my focus until ChatGPT came along.
252000	261000	And I've been focused on treating ChatGPT as a colleague here.
261000	267000	So I'm going to give a really detailed story about one conversation I had
267000	272000	with ChatGPT, which involved building a fireworks application.
272000	279000	And then I'm going to touch on some of these other examples that I've also
279000	285000	done with ChatGPT.
285000	292000	And I keep saying ChatGPT, and I started it with the older one,
292000	299000	but as soon as I had access to GPT-4, I only used the GPT-4 version of it,
299000	302000	which is just so much more capable than any of the other ones.
302000	309000	And I've done attempts to see if I could do it with Microsoft Bing or
309000	314000	Google's Barred or Hugging Chat or Claude from Anthropic or Pi,
314000	316000	which just came out.
316000	321000	And all of them did pretty poorly, though I did just read that today
321000	325000	Google said they're going to be announcing a new version of Barred
325000	329000	that's more capable in generating code.
329000	333000	So maybe it would be an equally good alternative.
333000	340000	And I didn't really explore very carefully the older version of ChatGPT.
340000	347000	So the first example I'll give you is where the, I asked ChatGPT to be more
347000	351000	like a tutor and I myself pretended to be a student.
351000	357000	But then the other six examples, it's much more of pair programming where
357000	363000	the chatbot is really doing all of the programming.
363000	368000	And I'm kind of the navigator kind of saying, oh, we should try this or
368000	371000	that's not working or what about this problem.
371000	375000	I also have to just because of the current technology do a little bit of
375000	382000	copy and paste, but that's very mechanical and not very interesting.
382000	388000	So first thing to understand is that these are much more than just code
388000	394000	generators that they, let me move this.
394000	400000	They could, just by their nature will, will not just give you code but give
400000	406000	you some explanations of what's going on in the bigger picture and how that works.
406000	411000	And then if you ask, it'll always put some comments in the code, but if you
411000	416000	don't really understand some function, you could just ask it to comment it and
416000	422000	it'll, every little section, it'll put in comments and not just sort of meaning,
422000	426000	I mean, redundant comments, but ones that are actually quite helpful.
426000	431000	And the other thing is it's, it often makes, constructs buggy code, but if you
431000	435000	tell it about the bugs, especially if you just copy and paste the error messages
435000	438000	into the chat, it could fix them.
438000	442000	And then if you ask it, and you say, okay, could you think of ways to improve
442000	447000	this app, it'll come up with a lot of sensible suggestions.
447000	452000	And then there's been cases where it couldn't generate some code because it
452000	457000	was trained two years ago, and they're, it was using an API that's much newer
457000	463000	than that. And all I did was copy and paste the documentation into the chat
463000	467000	GPT and, you know, read it in the chat.
467000	471000	And it could also generate documentation.
471000	475000	And it's also important, especially when you're thinking about children using
475000	479000	this that you could set, you could tell it from the beginning, you know,
479000	483000	you're talking to a young child, and it'll use a different kind of
483000	487000	language, you know, language, you know, you can use it as a, you know,
487000	491000	a language that's much newer than that. And all I did was copy and paste the
491000	495000	documentation into the chat GPT and, you know, read it in seconds and was
495000	499000	able, you know, use a different kind of vocabulary and avoid more technical
499000	503000	things and so on.
503000	510000	So I, all of these experiments I decided to use, ask it to create a web app
510000	516000	in JavaScript, you know, with some HTML and CSS. And the reason for that is
516000	521000	these three reasons is that there's nothing anyone would need to install
521000	525000	because everybody's got a browser. And browsers are so capable these days,
525000	529000	you know, they've got speech synthesis, speech recognition, they, you know,
529000	535000	they could easily communicate with all sorts of APIs and so on.
535000	540000	And, and then it's so much easier for people to share, you could actually
540000	547000	just send the index.html file on the script.js file to your friends,
547000	553000	or you could host it any number of places for free, just as static web pages.
553000	558000	You don't have to run a server or anything.
558000	565000	And what professional programmers are using, I recently read a survey that said
565000	571000	something like about 75% of people that are using large language models to help
571000	577000	with their programming are using the Visual Studio copilot, but 20 or 25% are
577000	581000	doing what I'm doing, which is just to have a conversation with the chatbot
581000	585000	that can program rather than have it nicely integrated. And of course,
585000	589000	being nicely integrated, you know, you don't have to do the copy and paste
589000	593000	and it maybe understands more of the bigger context. It's, it's, it's, but it's
593000	600000	much too complicated to imagine a typical school student using it.
601000	612000	Okay, so the example that I want to start with is this fireworks one, which
612000	615000	as I said before, this one's a little different than the other ones I'm going to
615000	621000	talk about because I, I, I asked it from the beginning to be more like a tutor
621000	624000	than just a colleague.
625000	632000	As you'll see, there's myself or my persona was pretending to be this. Yeah,
632000	637000	I needed to know something about JavaScript, but not that much.
637000	643000	And I'll show you the result in a minute, but let's just go through what this
643000	645000	conversation was all about.
646000	652000	So, um, I assume everybody could read this, that's France big enough and all
652000	660000	that. The, the, um, I, I started off by just saying you're a tutor for beginner
660000	664000	programmers, first learning JavaScript, you provide hints and explanations, but
664000	669000	never provide complete solutions. Instead, you nudge the learner towards
669000	675000	solutions. And it says, sure, I'll be happy to help. And then I said, can you,
675000	681000	how can I program a display of fireworks? And it says, oh, well, using a canvas
681000	685000	is probably the best way to go. And then it actually comes up with this, whatever
685000	689000	it is, eight point plan for how to actually build this, including, you know,
689000	694000	making different classes and having an animate and so on.
694000	700000	So this is one of the few places where this very nice tool called share GPT.com
700000	707000	fell down, which is, it makes for a really nice way of sharing your, um,
707000	713000	uh, your conversation with, with GPT, you just push a button and it creates a
713000	718000	URL that has the entire thing. But for some reason this, because I copy and
718000	723000	pasted here, this tiny little index HTML file ahead. But what it was, I'll tell
723000	729000	you right now is simply, it said here to create a, create a canvas.
729000	736000	So it was just basically the rear bones of a HTML file with a canvas and nothing
736000	742000	really else. And, you know, it's, it responds always in this real nice,
742000	746000	encouraging, friendly way that a good tutor maybe should be, you know, well,
746000	750000	that was a good starting point of our recommending a few more things you could
750000	754000	add these more features. And then it generates this, and you could just
754000	760000	simply in the live version of this, I just click on copy code and then it's on
760000	766000	the clipboard. And then I just create a folder called fireworks and I create a
766000	771000	file called index dot HTML and just paste this into it. You know, so I don't
771000	777000	really need to be very technically competent to, to have this kind of
777000	785000	experience. So then, remember it said also here, that I should use this get
785000	790000	element by ID and get context. So I'm assuming I knew a little bit here. So I
790000	796000	said, you know, oh, I, I just started, I did these two lines of code. And it's,
796000	803000	you know, great start and all that. So then it suggests that I size the canvas
803000	812000	and have it adjust whenever the browser windows is resized so that you always
812000	818000	have a canvas that's the right size. So I just again, you know, copy code and
818000	823000	just pasted it in. But it said the next thing it said here was to create a
823000	829000	class for fireworks. So I pretended not to know how to do that. So I said, how do
829000	836000	I define a class? And it gives a nice explanation and gives a nice little generic
836000	844000	example of a class and how you can make an instance. And then I actually made this
844000	851000	mistake. I meant to say how's this and paste in my little bit of code. But it
851000	856000	noticed that I forgot to include whether the code that it wanted me to review. So
856000	861000	here. So then I just pasted it in. So this is, you know, my attempt to be a
861000	865000	beginning student who kind of figured out from what it was saying that this is
865000	871000	what, what I should do. And again, you know, it's encouraging. It's on the right
871000	876000	track. But here's a few suggestions, you know, the convention is this should be
876000	883000	kept. Start with a capital letter. You know, I should have a update method and
883000	891000	maybe on a gravity be good. So, so it suggests this update and then I should
891000	904000	define these two methods. And then I was thinking that I, you know, if I'm assuming
904000	909000	that a student at least understands a little bit about velocity and gravity is not
909000	914000	the same, I'm sure they could have asked chat GPT here, but, but I didn't know
914000	919000	whether it would matter if I update the vertical position and then update the
919000	924000	velocity or update the velocity and then the vertical position. And it says
924000	929000	differently minimal, but most people do it this way. And it's a little bit better
929000	937000	to do it in this order. And then it gives me the code for it.
938000	944000	At that point, I pretend not to know how to, how to actually draw the fireworks
944000	950000	rocket. And, you know, it says, Oh, well, you know, we could do it. The simplest
950000	954000	thing would be to make it be a circle. And here's the code and notice it generated
954000	959000	all these comments and so on. And then it gives a nice explanation of how this works
959000	966000	and what it's doing. So now I have the bare minimum of this program, but I guess
966000	972000	I'm pretending that I have no idea how to even test this. So it says, Oh, well,
972000	978000	you could create a sample fireworks with these parameters and then create an
978000	986000	animation loop that just continually calls update and draw. And again, it
986000	991000	explains what's going on and how to get this to work. And then it says, you know,
992000	997000	this code should be in the file called fireworks.js. And then just click on the
997000	1003000	index.html file in the browser. And you'll see it working. And then it doesn't
1003000	1010000	working. So I was smart enough to say, Well, how could I see if there's an error
1010000	1015000	message? And then it tells me about different ways I could get to the console
1015000	1020000	and see what an error message is. And then I copy and pasted the error message in
1020000	1027000	here. And it realized that the problem was that the JavaScript was running before
1027000	1032000	the page had fully loaded. And it gives two ways of solving this. You use the
1032000	1041000	Windows on load, or you could simply move the script later in the HTML. And I did
1041000	1052000	the letter. So at that point, I saw the rocket go up. But it wasn't exploding yet,
1052000	1057000	of course. So I didn't have a good idea how to do the explosion. And it comes up
1057000	1065000	with this plan for how to do it and a basic outline of how to implement it. You
1065000	1073000	know, where it makes 50 particles and they all go off in random directions and
1073000	1087000	with some random speeds. And so then I thought, well, it wasn't clear if I should
1087000	1093000	just, because the fireworks rocket and the particles had very similar ways of
1093000	1098000	being drawn and being updated, whether I should really just copy the same code
1098000	1103000	and it says, oh, well, you know, you could create a base class and then have a
1103000	1109000	called moving object and then fireworks and particles could be subclasses that
1109000	1114000	extend it. And again, it's just giving you the sketch of how to do it. It doesn't
1114000	1124000	matter if it's filling everything for you right now. So, so I kind of follow this
1124000	1132000	advice, but I didn't understand again, how I could test it, because remember the
1132000	1135000	test before was just whether you could get a rocket to go up and how do I test the
1135000	1145000	thing. And it comes up with, again, a nice little plan for doing it. And then it
1145000	1153000	gives the sort of sketch of the code and leaves some things for me to do. And
1153000	1163000	again, it explains what to do. So it was giving me explanations and I said, how
1163000	1175000	about this for creating a test fireworks. And it said it looks good. And it'll create
1175000	1181000	one, you know, explains what it'll do. It'll be at the bottom and somewhere, but
1181000	1186000	it'll be red and initial velocity and with gravity or something. And then it's trying
1186000	1192000	to be kind of, again, I think it's pretty good that it doesn't just make me feel like
1192000	1197000	I'm, you know, ignorant and it's so knowledgeable. It says, well, here's a small
1197000	1204000	suggestion, you know, be nice to make the colors random rather than just all of them
1204000	1211000	being red and provides a very simple little function for coming up with a random
1211000	1218000	color and then shows how I could use it. So I tried all that. And now remember, it
1218000	1223000	doesn't have any idea with what's going on. I have to always tell it how things are
1223000	1229000	going. And I said, I think the fireworks would only go about a third of the way up
1229000	1234000	of the screen and blow up and they weren't using the full canvas. And it gives a nice
1234000	1240000	explanation that depending on the initial velocity and the gravity value, they may not
1240000	1249000	be in balance. So it suggests that I increased the velocity and decreased gravity. And I
1249000	1255000	tried it and now they flew off the top of the canvas. But because it kind of explained
1255000	1261000	what was going on, I just only increased the velocity and left gravity alone and it was
1261000	1275000	working just fine. And it approved my changes to its suggestions. And, you know, it's
1275000	1280000	saying there's no correct value, you could play with different ones, you could explore
1280000	1285000	until you get something you're happy with or something. So then I ask, well, how can I add
1285000	1292000	effects to this? And it explains that there's the audio API built into the browser and it
1292000	1299000	can read file, I mean, play files with these extensions. And it creates a tiny little function
1299000	1307000	for doing it. And it suggests that, you know, you put play sound of the launch when the
1307000	1317000	fireworks are created and then you play the explosion when it explodes. And then I ask
1317000	1323000	it, how would you suggest I search for the two sounds that we need? And it says, certainly
1323000	1328000	there's a lot of websites with four year paid ones. And it says this one is a collaborative
1328000	1333000	one with Creative Commons license sound. And then it even suggests, maybe I was up here,
1333000	1341000	yeah, the keywords I searched for fireworks launch or rocket launch or fireworks explosion.
1341000	1347000	So I put them in just as it suggested. And then I thought, it'd be nice to have a button
1347000	1355000	that when you push starts everything up rather than it just happens. So it says, well, you
1355000	1368000	could just add this button to your HTML. And then, and then in your JavaScript, get hold
1368000	1376000	of that button and put a listener that and it had this idea that you don't start the fireworks
1376000	1381000	until some global variable is set. And I could have just copied that but I said, you know,
1381000	1386000	I understood that if all I want to do is when the buttons pushed that it starts animating
1386000	1391000	why not just start animating. So I said, can't I just do that. And it says, oh, you're right
1391000	1398000	that more direct and, you know, straightforward. And, you know, said don't don't add this start
1398000	1406000	fireworks flag but instead, you know, is this kind of code or change the code, you know,
1406000	1421000	with this aspect. And then I noticed that the the request animation frame used to be that
1421000	1425000	the first thing it did and that was the last thing and I just got curious and said, does
1425000	1430000	it matter whether it's in the beginning of the end and it says it can have an impact but
1430000	1436000	the difference is usually subtle and explains how there's a risk that if you do it in the
1436000	1447000	beginning you might be you might lead to some performance issues and so on.
1447000	1455000	So everything was working and then in one of some of the suggested code there was a comment
1455000	1464000	saying that you should I should implement something that would remove the particles.
1464000	1469000	And I just said, you know, you said I should remove the particles but I didn't do it and
1469000	1478000	everything's working fine anyways. And it explains that you know, basically, you're, I might end up
1478000	1484000	consuming a lot more memory and processing on particles that are no longer visible or
1484000	1494000	that can lead to making everything go slow or use a lot of memory. And it suggests a life span, but I said
1494000	1500000	I'd rather have it just remove when they're no longer visible when it said sure that's reasonable and
1500000	1510000	generated the condition here for when particles off the outside, not visible anymore.
1510000	1516000	So everything was working but there was an annoying little scroll bars and horizontally and vertical.
1516000	1526000	And so I said I see these scroll bars and it said well maybe it's because the canvas and the page on the right
1526000	1532000	size and it suggested all this but actually that that's very close to what it had before.
1532000	1540000	And I said it didn't help. And then it came up with some more CSS to kind of deal with it.
1540000	1548000	And I said, yeah, a little bit better but because the scroll bars were less of an issue but there still were
1548000	1557000	there I mean there was very little scrolling involved. So then it said well maybe we just have to remove a few pixels from
1557000	1569000	the window dimensions of the canvas. And it suggested removing, you know, four pixels, and I tried it and it didn't work but
1569000	1578000	when I did 10 it was fine. So everything was fine. And then I said well, you know, fireworks should happen at night it should be a
1578000	1584000	black background so it just generated, you know these two lines of code here rather than clearing it.
1584000	1593000	And then I said, I can't think of any other improvements can you, and it came up with what is this nine different improvements, you know, a couple of them actually were already done
1593000	1601000	and it didn't seem to remember that it already randomized the colors and had a variable radius but
1601000	1611000	but it could have you know we could add wind or air resistance we could have more different shapes we could have a trail, you know, more user activity, you know.
1611000	1616000	So I thought well I'll just pick one of this number five.
1616000	1623000	So it suggested adding, you know, an alpha value and
1623000	1627000	and then the update uses it.
1627000	1635000	But notice that there's this thing called global alpha and I would have thought somehow alpha itself was all.
1635000	1644000	This I never heard of global alpha what is it and gives me nice explanation and how it works and why he's using it and so on.
1644000	1648000	So then
1648000	1652000	what when I tried doing the change that it suggested.
1652000	1667000	I got this error message that that you must call the super constructor in a derived class because since I was altering the some class without calling the super.
1667000	1672000	And it said oh you just have to add this line.
1672000	1677000	And so that fix that problem.
1677000	1687000	And I said, you know, it'd be nice if the app actually had a little note saying this was created with the help of GPT for
1687000	1691000	and having a link to the log.
1691000	1701000	And it created all this nice CSS and it created this div with the description and the link and so on.
1701000	1708000	And then it generated all this code but it actually forgot to add the
1708000	1719000	include the JavaScript script that the script element had been there and it just forgot it when I was putting this in so I just said you.
1719000	1727000	But again this is just, this wasn't a problem originally this is a problem with the shared GPT that sometimes when I paste things.
1727000	1733000	So they don't somehow make it into this history.
1733000	1737000	So then I said that you forgot this but I added it.
1737000	1747000	And then we want to remove the button after it's clicked and everything's working up if this is a problem that happens on many of the occasions which is
1747000	1750000	it used the word and knit here.
1750000	1756000	Well, earlier it was using the name of the function was animate.
1756000	1760000	I told it, you know, I fixed it but you know.
1760000	1777000	But I think because these conversations get long in the context is limited to, I don't know, I think it's up to 8,000 tokens for track GPT for and there's a 32 K version that access to but.
1777000	1790000	And as a result it's kind of forgetting some of the earlier stuff that it told me and it was just guessing. And this is a common problem. I'll show you where it forgets exactly what a variable name or function name isn't in there.
1790000	1802000	Generates code with a similar name with the same kind of concept but obviously one that won't work because computer programming languages need the exact same name.
1802000	1807000	I'll show you the results of all of this.
1807000	1818000	So if I click here.
1818000	1821000	Happy.
1821000	1834000	Yeah.
1834000	1849000	And that took, I don't know, less than two hours I probably should have kept track of the timing, the whole experience but I thought, you know, it was a very promising kind of
1849000	1861000	experience in terms of how helpful it was how much it was suggesting things how good the suggestions were, how much and understood about things and how much a good explain things.
1861000	1866000	So, that's what I want to say about fireworks.
1866000	1879000	But one thing that everybody's been talking about with these chatbots is how important it is to do prompt engineering and there are many contexts in which it really is important, but I've been surprised for almost all my experiments.
1879000	1893000	I very, very rarely did any attempt to make good prompts, you know, I would copy and paste an error instead of saying, Well, this is the error I found in the console or so.
1893000	1910000	It was the only one where I wanted it to be more of a tutor so I had this, this, sorry, prompt here but that was pretty much the only exception where I wasn't just having an ordinary conversation with it.
1910000	1929000	I didn't bother to make it use speech instead of typing these things but that's straightforward to do especially because, you know, browsers have speech recognition API.
1929000	1939000	Okay, so let me tell you a little bit about these six other experiments I did.
1939000	1946000	Okay, so, right.
1946000	1955000	So here, I wasn't playing the house key into play the role of a tutor I was treating it very much like pair programming.
1955000	1965000	And I'm more than navigator suggesting things and chat GPT is the, the one actually generating the code or something.
1965000	1976000	So I said how can I create a web page with a button that when clicked speaks a random integer, less than 1000 in a random language pitch rate and voice.
1976000	1982000	So it, you know, told me here's some HTML. Here's the JavaScript.
1982000	2001000	It had just three languages but said you can add more. And it understood all about the speech synthesis API that the, you know, HTML five, all the browsers have.
2001000	2010000	And it's picking a random pitch or random rate and learning the language and reporting errors and stuff.
2010000	2022000	So, so just with what the first pass like this, when I clicked on the button.
2022000	2029000	I saw that there was this error or not no voices available but then if I clicked again, everything worked fine from then on.
2030000	2043000	It understood exactly what was going on which is that the get voices is asynchronous and they may not have been loaded when the first time you clicked on the button but then the second time it has is loaded.
2043000	2054000	So you could program around this by
2055000	2068000	on voices changed so that you, you don't try to say anything until this flag has been set that the voices have been loaded.
2068000	2079000	So that worked. And then I said, Oh, it'll be nice to display what the number is and the language and I said etc and then understood perfectly well that meant the pitch and the rate and so on.
2079000	2088000	And also, I didn't really like the idea of having to go to the console to see an error message so could you report it some other way.
2088000	2097000	And, you know, it updated the HTML updated the JavaScript.
2097000	2113000	And then it was pretty ugly so I just simply said add CSS I didn't, you know, say more than that, and it generated some reasonable CSS to make it all look nicer and explaining what it was and stuff.
2113000	2124000	And then, rather than have just those three languages baked into it. I said why don't you add all the languages that are available in Chrome.
2124000	2142000	And I said in Chrome but it actually comes up and it says Chrome here too but it actually comes up with a solution that'll work for any browser, because it's just collecting all the languages that the browser has available, and then pulling out the language code.
2142000	2147000	The languages, the voices.
2147000	2150000	So,
2150000	2162000	so that worked. And I had a working version of this but then I thought it'd be nice to have an additional capability in this app.
2162000	2171000	So I said, add a cartoon image of a parrot and when you click on it repeats what the user says with a random language pitch rate and place.
2171000	2190000	So it, you know, it has this parrot that thing and it says you know I should put replace that with my path to whatever I put a parrot image, and then it knew perfectly well how to use the speech recognition.
2190000	2195000	API to pick up what somebody was saying.
2195000	2205000	And that worked and I said well, give the user feedback as to what text it was actually had heard, along with the other things that were there.
2205000	2208000	And
2208000	2222000	and then I said, you know we had a button for speaking random number but I said, use this file again and you can see this is basically, I went to Dolly and said, you know, a colorful collection of random integers.
2222000	2230000	And it generated that image and I just asked it to incorporated in the app.
2230000	2239000	And then it didn't look so nice they were vertical and they were kind of small so I said make them larger and lay them out horizontally.
2239000	2242000	And it had no problems doing that.
2242000	2248000	And then I just thought, you know, how would you explain what this app does to a young child.
2248000	2256000	It says, the app head has two pictures one of colorful numbers another parrot when you click on the picture of colorful numbers the apple.
2256000	2266000	Make your computer or phone say a random number, it's like picking a number out of a hat but the computer does it for you so it's really trying to you know explain this at a
2266000	2273000	to a young child pretty well I think you know it's even more fun is the number will be spoken in different language voice speed each time.
2273000	2288000	So if you click on the parrot picture, the app listens to what you say just like a parrot listening to talk, and then the parrot, actually the computer pretending to be the pair will repeat which is really nice, I thought explanation.
2288000	2295000	And then I said, well, can it translate what was heard.
2295000	2309000	So you could use Google translate and you need an API key and here's the way to talk to that API and you should, you know, put the key here and goes on and on.
2309000	2322000	And I asked, you know, so the API key shouldn't be picked in and should ask for it.
2323000	2337000	I have a, I thought it might be better to use hugging face instead of Google translate so I said, how about using hugging face instead and it was perfectly fine to use hugging face.
2337000	2341000	But then when I tried it as kept getting these error messages.
2341000	2352000	And what was really happening was that when you ask hugging face to use a particular model.
2352000	2362000	If it wasn't already loaded, it'll load it and give you back a response saying it's loading please wait an estimated, you know, 10 seconds or something.
2362000	2377000	But the code wasn't paying attention to that and also I didn't really want it to wait. So, even though it, it explained what was going on and how to fix it. I just went and got a Google translate key.
2377000	2385000	And so let me show you the result.
2385000	2396000	So I'm not going to bother with the translate because I have to get my key and paste it and all that, but it works perfectly fine without it. So if I click here.
2396000	2403000	So it picked Italian a very high pitch and low rate 408.
2403000	2407000	And then if I do this, it should be listening.
2407000	2409000	It should be.
2409000	2411000	Oh, yeah.
2411000	2414000	It should be listening to me as I speak.
2415000	2423000	And again, if I if we had the API key would have translated that to French inside it.
2423000	2432000	And again, I had this link to the dialogues you could actually see how this was created.
2432000	2445000	I have to mention that this parrot, my two year old granddaughter just giggled and giggled and giggled when we'd say things to it and it would repeat it. And it would repeat it in a funny voice or something.
2445000	2448000	And would repeat it in a funny voice or something.
2448000	2453000	Anyway, she thought that was just so fun. Okay.
2453000	2459000	So let me talk about the next one.
2459000	2472000	I said, how can I make a web page that detects which way I'm pointing my finger and uses it to draw on a canvas. So my original concept was that if I pointed this way would draw that way if I pointed this way draw that way and so on.
2472000	2481000	But it misunderstood me but actually came up with an equally good scheme that I wasn't didn't bother pursuing.
2481000	2485000	So what's so interesting about this is just from this.
2486000	2492000	You know, does generates all this HTML CSS but the JavaScript.
2492000	2510000	Actually, I think it says it here too that it. Yeah, it's actually going to use a machine learning model that's a hand pose that'll figure out, you know, 33 different locations on your finger, you know, the each joint and so on.
2510000	2517000	And knows how to load it and use it and so on and also of course how to get the video feed going into it.
2517000	2532000	And then here how to load the TensorFlow.js library and then how to load the hand pose model, and how to use it and then how to use it to detect if I'm my fingers pointing upward.
2533000	2542000	And this is why an interesting thing that sometimes it's generating code and just stops in the middle, or the case the explanation.
2542000	2561000	And that's because, you know, it only does so much of a completion it's limited to 1000 or 2000 tokens or something but if you just say please continue it just apologizes and just starts right where pretty much where left off and, you know, continues generating code.
2562000	2577000	And then I said, well, nothing's being drawn and it says oh there's some issue about the position on the canvas, and it turns out it was a bit confused about the to the coordinate system of the
2577000	2592000	hand pose and the coordinate system of the canvas, but it tried to fix it and then I said well now it's only drawing in small area and it finally, you know, gets it right with some changes.
2592000	2601000	And then this is this problem where it uses some variable called predictions but
2601000	2607000	but it was, in this case I think it was a scoping error but sometimes it's because it had a different name and some other part of the code.
2607000	2614000	So it suggests how to pass the make it available here.
2614000	2624000	And then I said, well, how about if you say the color it'll change to the color that the user spoke and it
2624000	2643000	will again use a speech recognition and only accepts, you know, these 10 different colors and if you say any of it, if what you said includes any of the these 10 colors then it'll switch to that color.
2643000	2647000	And there's a default color of black and so on.
2647000	2659000	And it turned out, it worked the first time but only the first time and it said, oops, sorry for the confusion I should be using the API bill differently and it regenerates the code.
2659000	2667000	And everything's working and I said well let's display what what the last thing spoken in the current color so that people know that it's here hanging it.
2667000	2682000	And then this is very nice I just said add instructions on how to use the app, and it generates, you know, the, the HTML to explain how to use it, and make some CSS to make that look nice.
2682000	2687000	And then somehow the display didn't get right.
2687000	2695000	Again, because I think it was forgetting what it was calling things before it was using different similar but different names here.
2695000	2704000	And again the same problem that it could picked up the wrong variable name or something.
2704000	2712000	So it's not the problem might have been that we were doing things before the page was loaded but that wasn't really the problem.
2712000	2718000	So I said that that didn't fix it and then I said just I didn't have the same much more same problem.
2718000	2732000	And that didn't help. So I had an idea what was wrong but I wasn't right either and it said, it thought maybe that was the issue.
2732000	2742000	So, and also notice this problem like you know, whether it was calling it video or webcam it wasn't consistently naming things.
2742000	2748000	So it was finally got it all working.
2748000	2756000	And I didn't understand what happened so somehow it started to work even though these changes didn't seem, I don't know.
2756000	2774000	And then there was a really minor problem that took forever to fix which was, it was showing the last thing that it heard, and then the color, all in the same line and would look nicer if they're on separate lines and it just keeps not getting it right and finally,
2774000	2797000	I said, maybe it's something to do with the overlay. And then it comes up with this solution that I didn't even know about there was some fancy CSS to deal with the problem.
2797000	2807000	So everything's working fine and then I said, you know, could you explain to a 10 year old how it work and once again it does a really nice job of explaining how this thing works.
2807000	2814000	And let me show you how what it's like.
2814000	2821000	Oh, but I have to turn off the video.
2821000	2824000	Turn it off the video right.
2824000	2831000	I'll be trying to load it again.
2831000	2850000	So, notice that it generated these instructions all by itself and say I turned off the video. Oh here comes good. So now, if I move my finger like this and I say red, red, blue, blue, blue.
2850000	2854000	It's kind of, you know, it's working.
2854000	2859000	But I'm able to draw all over it with my finger.
2859000	2863000	A five year old or a 10 year old who really like.
2863000	2874000	Yeah, no, actually, my granddaughter, this was funny too that I can draw on it. Okay, so, but there was what I thought was interesting was, you know, had no troubles.
2874000	2882000	Loading a machine learning model using it appropriately to get the hand poses just knew how to do all those sort of things.
2882000	2895000	So the next example I wanted to talk about is if some, some person wanted to actually do a little bit of machine learning on some of their own data.
2895000	2911000	So, I had this spreadsheet which was had just 60 examples 20 examples of some text that shows a lot of confidence 20 examples that shows a real lack of confidence and 20 that were kind of neutral.
2911000	2919000	And I said how can I make a web page that would predict the level of confidence of some new text.
2919000	2928000	You know, and give some suggestions and, and but oh, but, but I didn't say anything about JavaScript so it thought oh I should just do this all in Python.
2928000	2937000	And then I said no no I don't want to do it in Python how could I do in JavaScript and then it says well here's how you could do it using node and I just wanted a web page.
2937000	2943000	So I say, no I don't want to use node I only want the browser and so well here's how we could do it.
2944000	2947000	Um,
2947000	2957000	you know it's loading TensorFlow.js it creates the model, the very small model and compiles it and does the training and
2957000	2969000	and then does a prediction and shows the shows what's going on. And again it stopped right in the middle of the generating I just said continue and it continued generating.
2969000	2975000	So I should have these two files.
2975000	2981000	And then I have to put the CSV file somewhere in that same folder or something.
2981000	2988000	So it actually worked but yeah there was no feedback that it while it was training so I said can you make a graph of the training loss.
2988000	2997000	And so it loads some library and it knows perfectly well how to integrate this library.
2997000	3013000	With the callback of the training and it worked but the plot was much bigger than the page and it looked pretty ugly so I said it was too big and CSS I made it nice makes it look nicer.
3013000	3021000	And I said, you know why don't why don't you show the likelihood scores for the predictions and it doesn't do that and it does.
3021000	3025000	And then I asked how can I make this more accurate because it wasn't very accurate.
3025000	3035000	And it says well you could have more data you could do some pre processing rotation you could change the model architecture, you could, you know all these things.
3035000	3048000	And I said well how about you improve the model architecture and it says sure and it makes a bigger model with more layers and
3048000	3058000	and then I said well maybe the user wants to explore how many epochs that give a interface so the user could enter how many epochs they want.
3058000	3069000	And the graph came up after it was finished training so I said could you make the graph, the updated while it's doing the training, and it's a chair and I heard that.
3069000	3071000	And then you know, finish.
3071000	3077000	And then I said, could the training function was pretty complicated so I said could you have comments to it.
3077000	3084000	And notice, you know for each section it says okay you know getting the inputs, preparing the data creating the model.
3084000	3091000	Setting up the graph, you know, setting up the call back and it just goes on and on explaining it nicely.
3091000	3106000	And then I happened to notice that it was gave very different answers depending on whether I had uppercase or not, and it understood exactly what was going on that it was using the universal sentence encoder.
3106000	3112000	It was very sensitive, and it can.
3112000	3125000	It can easily fix this by, of course, just taking one of the user input and sending it to lower case so there wasn't that difference. And there it was so let's see it in action.
3125000	3128000	So, I'm going to say, I don't know.
3128000	3130000	That's just because it.
3130000	3137000	So, it says training, but it's actually
3137000	3153000	coming up with the embeddings for the 60 sentences and there is that now we get the training and see the validation losses going up and so it's overfitting or something, but I could type something here like
3153000	3163000	I say, predict.
3163000	3169000	And it says 99.7% sure that it's confident.
3169000	3182000	And I say,
3182000	3195000	And then
3195000	3197000	Well, didn't do so good.
3197000	3203000	Should have been neutral, but thought that was maybe it's showing some confidence.
3203000	3211000	Anyways, so that I thought was pretty impressive that it could do something like that.
3211000	3215000	So, let's see.
3215000	3218000	So, in terms of timing.
3218000	3223000	I don't want to show all of these because it'll take too long but I wanted to.
3223000	3226000	I think I'll show two more but I'll try to go quickly is that.
3226000	3240000	Okay, so this one is using asking chat GPT to use GPT to make a conversation between personas.
3240000	3243000	personas.
3243000	3246000	And
3246000	3249000	you know who knows how to.
3249000	3254000	Well actually didn't know how to call the
3254000	3258000	API.
3258000	3268000	Oh, so various points I had to copy and paste the documentation from their website and then was able to do it fine.
3268000	3282000	And again, it was trying to use no and I said no, no, I don't want to. And this is interesting that this is why we're using the API key in the front end that's a little bit not recommended because the key could get.
3282000	3287000	Somebody might be able to get your key or whatever.
3287000	3289000	Let me maybe this one.
3289000	3296000	I could just, oh, I do want to show you one bug that was so funny.
3296000	3299000	Yeah, here it is.
3299000	3318000	So there's trying to be a conversation between Aristotle and Galileo, but what, but at this point in the progress at Aristotle says I am Galileo and Galileo says I am Aristotle I am not Galileo and then Aristotle says I am Galileo I am Galileo I'm both there so it just was totally crazy.
3318000	3331000	It understood what was wrong here and how to, you know, change the roles and the right messages to the chat system, such that.
3331000	3333000	Let me show you.
3333000	3340000	Well actually just an interest of time I'll just show you a screenshot.
3340000	3343000	So,
3343000	3346000	you could enter any two people here.
3346000	3351000	And then you could join in by just typing a message here and saying send.
3351000	3368000	So, Galileo greets Aristotle, and they're both really polite to each other, and they appreciate each kind words and blah, and then I jump in and say well how fast objects fall and Aristotle says to Galileo, you know,
3368000	3378000	the challenge seems to know things that happened every died but you know that his motion is a motion of a challenge but he still maintains the speeds proportional to the weight.
3378000	3381000	And Galileo says, you know,
3381000	3395000	Oh, and then if there's some weird bug words, it actually repeats this twice and I mentioned it to chat GPT but I made the mistake of mentioning that and another problem and it dealt with the other problem and I never came back to figuring out why.
3395000	3397000	Sometimes it repeats.
3397000	3400000	Anyways,
3400000	3407000	Aristotle's respectfully disagreeing and explaining this and so it's a nice little, you know,
3407000	3415000	app.
3415000	3422000	And so, let me show you the most complicated one.
3422000	3426000	I'll tell you real quick. Well, I'll just show you this one.
3426000	3429000	This one.
3429000	3438000	Flowers are all fading away and shrinking, but I could drop water balloons on them and they get bigger or something.
3438000	3447000	So that's.
3447000	3453000	So, you know, it's hard to keep watering all these flowers, you know, so that's that.
3453000	3469000	That's what it, you know, we did with a little conversation. But this was a funny one because it actually was partially working and then in trying to add another feature it broke some of the earlier stuff and then it just wasn't it.
3469000	3475000	This was about the only time when I've really had some not very good results.
3475000	3484000	But when I started over again, it actually did well and also I have links here for how you know bar did trying this or something.
3484000	3491000	Okay, so this is the, the really big ambitious one that I did.
3491000	3499000	And it's a counter to the thing 111 exchanges back and forth.
3499000	3508000	In the beginning, what I asking you to do is to create,
3508000	3515000	generate a story, and I picked this because
3515000	3525000	you know, Gaiman in Sandman, there's this story where this character has kidnapped amused and for punishment.
3526000	3543000	It's getting so many ideas for stories that it's that he's going crazy can't think of anything other than stories and there's like a lot of crazy stories including a man who falls in love with paper dolls so I actually did all 15 that came from that story, plus some
3543000	3546000	other ones that I invented.
3547000	3558000	So it generates, you know, three paragraphs like, like I asked, and then I said, can you criticize them and it says oh well we could do this character development or better setting.
3558000	3564000	And it's not generic ones it's saying the town the theater was only briefly mentioned maybe you could improve that or something.
3564000	3574000	So it's able to apply suggestions one and four and it does that and then I say well to Chris, you know, come up with criticism for the second paragraph.
3574000	3580000	So it's able to criticize its own generation, its own creations and then apply changes.
3580000	3586000	So then I said put it all together into a single story, and then I said,
3586000	3598000	the version of an illustration for each paragraph include the medium the artistic style mood point of view lighting and the like, and it comes up with these kinds of.
3598000	3603000	So then, at that point I said well I'd like to make a webpage in which you could do this interactively.
3603000	3615000	And then we get it works, but then eventually works, I should say, and this is a place where it didn't know how to use the.
3615000	3637000	It's the Dolly API, but I just pasted the documentation and you know it's really just copy and paste it with all the, you know, crazy stuff that happens when you just copy and paste it still understood it well enough to generate the right code.
3637000	3657000	And so then I, it goes on and on very long this one I, I, once I got it working for that I said well let's make it work for any story and let's make it so that you could criticize the illustrations and generate new ones and so on.
3657000	3662000	Maybe I'll show you the final result here.
3663000	3667000	Well, by the way, I even if you want to get it.
3667000	3683000	An idea of how I did this without going through the entire 111 things I kind of highlighted the main things of what I did and what happened and what was going on here.
3683000	3692000	And the, here it is.
3692000	3697000	So we, by the way, it generated all of the instructions here.
3697000	3707000	So it tells you again this is, I just said add in and instructions in the beginning with a button to close them and it explains how this whole thing works.
3707000	3717000	So then, you know, needs my key there and then I say,
3717000	3727000	can.
3727000	3732000	I didn't try this before three, three is probably good.
3732000	3751000	So one thing you could do here was I added this button that could actually show you the communications with GPT for and with Dolly so you could see what actually it's, you know, it does.
3751000	3758000	So this shouldn't take more than another less than a minute I think.
3758000	3778000	So this is going to have all of those features that I kind of experimented with in the dialogue so you could ask for, ask it to generate criticism you could decide to apply the criticism to rewrite a paragraph, and you could also get criticism about the illustrations.
3778000	3794000	And you could even enter your own criticism of an illustration and it'll regenerate that will update the illustration prompt and then generate a new story and it should
3794000	3801000	interleave the text and the images.
3801000	3805000	So,
3805000	3828000	one of the problems with using GPT for is that it's so much slower than 3.5 3.5 would have, you know, done this long ago but for just just as such a nicer job that I tend not to use it obviously I could have asked GPT for to make an interface where you could decide which,
3828000	3832000	what role do you want to use for doing this.
3832000	3836000	Maybe what I should do. Oh, here comes finally.
3836000	3852000	So, I stood nervously at the podium with the prestigious Stanford University and elite seminar series in electrical engineering, he had spent countless hours perfecting his presentation and sustainable energy systems and was the culmination of his hard work as he looked
3852000	3862000	at the learning of intelligent faces eager to hear what he had to say, he felt a sense of pride also mounting pressure to deliver amounts and shoes, and here I am giving the speech.
3862000	3865000	And if I,
3865000	3875000	throw over it we could see that it says the illustrations of watercolor painting with realistic and softly blended colors depicting the anxious Ken standing at the podium the setting as well.
3875000	3880000	Lit hall with the iconic Stanford University seal.
3880000	3883000	That's true.
3883000	3895000	It's getting enhancing it intensity the point of view is from the audience looking. So it's a bit confused because the audience is there and it's looking at the audience but this is a dolly problem it's it's actually generated.
3895000	3900000	So if I click on this. Here's the, the description.
3900000	3905000	And
3905000	3908000	Oh, that's interesting.
3908000	3921000	Well, maybe it's still thinking, because I think it's going to, it's going to show some suggested changes to the
3921000	3924000	to the thing.
3924000	3925000	I don't know.
3925000	3933000	So maybe I'll just say,
3933000	3948000	I don't like changes. So rewrite the description.
3948000	3961000	And then once it's the descriptions were written I could hit. So now it should say an oil painting was realistic when I say replace the image and generate a new one or something.
3961000	3968000	And even while this is happening I could, I think I could click. Oh, here it comes. I'll close this.
3968000	3972000	And there I am giving a lecture.
3972000	3974000	It looks just like you.
3974000	3976000	Yeah.
3976000	3986000	And then if I click here, I'll get some criticism that it'll generate for the first paragraph here.
3986000	3994000	By the way, we can see what the other paragraphs look like well the audience got excited here.
3994000	3997000	This is the pro AI group.
3997000	3999000	And then.
3999000	4001000	Wow.
4001000	4006000	Looks like everybody wanted my autograph at the end.
4006000	4015000	It's pretty good.
4015000	4024000	As he concluded the talk and any questions it was clear that he made an impact professors and students like approached him praising. This is pretty good.
4024000	4027000	Anyways, if we go here.
4027000	4032000	So it generates seven suggestions for how to change this paragraph.
4032000	4036000	The opening sentence.
4036000	4043000	Introduce more background on Ken so that the readers understand my qualifications and reasons for giving the talk.
4043000	4044000	Whatever.
4044000	4049000	And I could even say here you know change it from energy systems to chat.
4049000	4055000	So that's the, the most ambitious.
4055000	4060000	That I created with chat.
4060000	4064000	So I'm practically finished here.
4064000	4071000	So one question in my mind is doing this does it automate away the fun of programming.
4071000	4081000	Or is it better to think of this as empowering people with very little programming skills to create all sorts of be very creative and creating apps.
4081000	4096000	And see more pampered often wrote about hard fun because one of the children talked about how programming and logo was was hard fun that it was, or he probably said it was fun but hard.
4096000	4099000	So,
4099000	4112000	that's still the case but it's also for a lot of children they find it frustrating or too difficult and, you know, just doesn't always work to introduce programming to children.
4112000	4120000	And also there's sometimes the teachers don't are much support because they don't understand very well how to program either.
4120000	4136000	So the, the plus side is that by having a collaboration like this anybody with just an idea for an app that's reasonable obviously, if you wanted to make, you know, a triple A rated game or something, you're not likely to succeed.
4136000	4140000	But it could come to life through this kind of process.
4140000	4160000	Of course, GPT for is GPT for there will be a five and a six and a seven and eight. Yeah, exactly. That's exactly what I'm talking about the future here so the short term we could expect it just to get, you know, more competent and the GPT for can
4160000	4176000	look at images and understand them, but that's only been released to a to a very small number of testers and some company that's producing software for blind people.
4176000	4194000	But that's coming so you could you should be able to just like take a screenshot of of a problem with your app and then say well here's here's what what's going on and it'll interpret the image and maybe figure out how to fix things.
4194000	4216000	And this copy and paste thing is, you know, obviously can be automated. And, you know, the, probably as many of you know about the, the leaked Google Docs that claims that the open source alternatives to barred and GPT for are getting so good that maybe
4216000	4224000	the big players don't really have any particular edge over what's going on in the open source rule.
4224000	4238000	So maybe that will be something that near term could be done but the long term who knows it's really going to keep getting better and more capable and so on.
4238000	4254000	And so I, I asked Dolly to create a water color painting for the question and answer portion of the talk. And I said no text should be included in it.
4255000	4264000	So, hopefully there are some questions.
4264000	4270000	How do you like working with an AI as a, as a colleague.
4271000	4294000	The, the first thing, the fireworks thing was the most pleasant one because it was, it was trying to be, you know, had this role more of a tutor, the, the other ones that was still, you know, really interesting but I felt like it was kind of writing this program and asking
4294000	4313000	for a lot of copy and pasting, you know, and to report about errors, you know, that that was sort of my role. I mean, of course, that's not quite fair because what I also did was, and this is maybe an important aspect of this is that I always started with the simplest version of the app that I had in mind.
4313000	4336000	And once I got that, I would ask for a single enhancement and once that works another one so I was, I was, I did have a, an incremental plan for how the app should get build that was purely mine and it was, you know, my assistant in that role but, but often it was more like, you know,
4336000	4344000	just telling me okay here's some code replace this here's some code, you know, copy and paste this and.
4344000	4362000	But it was still something exciting about the fact that you know it understood me so well and I was, and I was able to do so many things and knew all these different APIs and was better at CSS than I am for sure.
4362000	4370000	It was hard, at least in my experience CSS is not transferred.
4370000	4386000	So, I attended a talk at Stanford, a couple weeks ago, and they did a study of the security of the code generated I think it was by co pilot co generator, and they found that it was dismal.
4386000	4395000	In fact, programmers who use co pilot produced less secure code than those who did not, but the ones who did thought their code was more secure.
4395000	4402000	And the conclusion of that study was that the assistant lacks context.
4402000	4414000	Why you were showing some of the examples I was just scrolling through the text and it looks like it's the same problem there that the assistant is losing context.
4415000	4432000	Yeah, no, that was the other annoying thing was that it was losing context and there were a few times when I realized that it just had completely forgotten what the source code for for a part of it or so I would copy and paste something
4433000	4445000	much earlier and said, you know, and here's the dysfunction or here's this HTML that we're using and that often would would help because now it was in the
4445000	4460000	I wasn't thinking so much of forgetting as it seemed that in some cases, it, it misinterpreted the context of what you were asking, because it didn't know the environment in which you were working.
4460000	4463000	Yeah.
4463000	4467000	Well,
4467000	4483000	generally, I mean like that example where with the video one where I had originally intended. Oh, I should put my video back on.
4483000	4495000	I originally intended it, you know that I can point with my finger in different directions and that would indicate which way the pen would move or something, as opposed to the way it came up with.
4495000	4511000	But I was just as happy with that rather than trying to get it to interpret it the way I intended, but in terms of security I thought it was pretty impressive that it really tried hard to talk me out of
4511000	4516000	using the API key in a static web page like this.
4516000	4533000	On the other hand, I, you know, I said, you know, make it a password field and, you know, it's, it's not really a problem that that a user is putting the key into a web page like this but of course,
4533000	4547000	once it's hosted somewhere, somebody has to trust that you're not stealing their key. But of course the, the, in every one of these cases you can look at the source and the code is actually quite clear and nice.
4547000	4556000	So somebody could see that the API key isn't sent off to somebody or something.
4556000	4572000	In this kind of context, I don't think the security is such an issue, but obviously, if you're, if you're making some kind of web service and, you know, there's a lot more things to think about in terms of security.
4572000	4586000	Yeah, I was, I wasn't so worried about security for these apps as much as the context issue. There's so much implicit context that the programmer has that the assistant does not.
4586000	4595000	Right. Yeah, I mentioned it'll be quite different if I was doing some really large project.
4595000	4619000	Because, you know, so the, this last one, the illustrated story generator, it did, it was a little more than 500 lines of JavaScript. So, and, and that's actually too large for the, at least the default version of chat GBT I can't say, you know, paste in this entire 500 lines and say
4619000	4625000	now let's modify it in some way it's just too much context.
4625000	4642000	I mean, too many tokens for it to be fit its context window. So there are these limitations of course, the, like I just saw today some startup saying that they've got a context window of 50,000 tokens.
4642000	4646000	I've been, you know, using I think 8000 or something.
4646000	4671000	So that, and there's even some research paper that claimed that they had a million token context that was using some clever algorithms because you know that the context normally is a quadratic complexity but if you're clever you can make it and log in or something.
4672000	4697000	Well, I think I really blown away again this is this is a very nice expression to how people seem to be using the, the artificial intelligence devices or personal persona.
4697000	4724000	This is as a component in a larger system. And I guess now the ads we see for, you know, doctors who use AI and get us to use AI and people who play with AI, driven games and so forth, has, has more context in terms of the current AI systems.
4724000	4728000	I think that's a very useful thing.
4728000	4730000	Yeah, you're back.
4730000	4732000	Yeah.
4732000	4752000	I think I really appreciate the introduction because I had not thought about this part of it I always thought the hard part was twiddling the knobs on the, the data used to do on the AI but
4752000	4757000	talking to the AI turns out to be complex enough.
4757000	4759000	Yeah.
4759000	4776000	You know, if you go back a year you had to give it, you know, several examples of what you were intending and had to engineer your prompt kind of carefully to get it to be pretty competent but GPT for as I mentioned I really just seem much more of a natural
4776000	4779000	conversation.
4779000	4788000	And I'm really I'm curious to see how, you know, a 12 year old deals with such things, you know, better.
4788000	4790000	Probably better than you and I do.
4790000	4794000	Yeah, that's right.
4794000	4812000	My, my, my favorite story is watching a non speaking child sort of order six months old stealing his mother's phone and the per password and then using it to play his video.
4812000	4819000	This is this is adaptation at a very low rate or very high rate.
4819000	4823000	Somebody's got a somebody's got a question you watching the hands up Dennis.
4823000	4826000	I'm not watching it at all.
4826000	4831000	When you want to you want to call people and put them up.
4831000	4834000	Yeah, go ahead you got your hand up.
4834000	4841000	Yeah, I was just, I had a question about the
4841000	4847000	Edges of the models understanding of programming.
4847000	4861000	Is there any indication or what was your experience in finding the edges of the, what the model knew about a particular API or
4861000	4870000	programming in general. I mean, I was specifically thinking, I use a prototypical inheritance over the newer class inheritance.
4870000	4878000	And I was just kind of curious there's probably a lot less, a lot fewer code examples of that on the, on the internet.
4878000	4887000	So probably less training data for that. I was just curious if you encountered, if you looked at how the model degrades.
4887000	4889000	Yeah.
4889000	4897000	Well, I didn't really but I did notice something about the, it's coding styles.
4897000	4908000	And it wasn't always consistent like a tiny example but maybe illustrative one is that this problem about, you know, where the JavaScript's trying to
4908000	4916000	get an element from the down, but the page hasn't loaded yet.
4916000	4922000	It was using sometimes this unload as a, you know,
4922000	4935000	and sometimes it was using a listener to on DOM content loaded which is what I've read is the proper better way of doing it that on load is an older way that isn't as good but it's still kind of works.
4935000	4938000	So, so there is this kind of.
4938000	4951000	Two different issues one is whether it's on load or on DOM, DOM content load but also as to whether it's using, it's actually using at event listener, or whether it's just setting the listener directly.
4951000	4955000	And it kind of wasn't consistent sometimes we'll do one sometimes the other.
4955000	4964000	You know, again, because I guess most of the programs that it looked at were consistent about which way they would deal with that.
4964000	4970000	It was like a real program.
4970000	4987000	No, but it's just a bit of a real programmer tends to have us one style in which they stick to for those kinds of tasks, but it was I thought it was a bit odd that it was kind of flip flopping about whether it was, you know, which way would deal with that problem.
4987000	4993000	So real programmers coming back six months later will not be consistent with what.
4993000	4996000	Thank you.
4996000	4999000	Very cool things that can do.
4999000	5003000	It's a program and you mentioned the prompt engineering.
5003000	5013000	Before, so that it may not require any more prompt engineering almost a row. So that is recognized usable and you also mentioned role playing.
5013000	5021000	And one of the techniques. So now, there are more developing stress on techniques rather than engineering of prompt itself.
5021000	5035000	But maybe from your experience of this project, what these techniques would you found helpful. Maybe you found something of your own that helped you to navigate the chat activity for
5035000	5056000	Well, the problem a little bit was that I was always really the underlying motivation for a lot of this was thinking about, you know, what kind of learning materials or experience what I imagine like a high school student having.
5056000	5070000	So I was rarely kind of role playing myself I was often, you know, pretending in my head, you know, to be maybe a high school student that knew a little bit about this and not much about that or something.
5070000	5073000	So,
5074000	5085000	maybe I'll try this soon, which is, especially if it's a younger child. I think if you set up the context better and I say, you know,
5086000	5100000	you're going to be helping a nine year old who doesn't know much about programming to build the apps that they want, you know, be sure to explain things carefully and not use too much technical jar.
5100000	5115000	And he's set up set up a context like that, that it would tend to, I believe it but I even tried this that it would tend to use language much more appropriate to communicate with a nine year old because it does.
5115000	5133000	There's two examples of where I said, after built an app I said, what could you explain to a nine year old, or it's young child how this app would work it. I thought I did a great job of explaining it in, in, you know, the right kind of vocabulary and right kind of analogies.
5134000	5150000	But I should really come up with a task that actually I want to do and just stop pretending to be a student and just see, you know, what I could accomplish as well.
5151000	5166000	And I'm doing it this way is I've always been interested in kids and programming, but also there's, there's an awful lot of real programmers that are using chat GPT to get accomplished their day to day tasks so I thought this would be a more
5167000	5182000	experience to think in terms of, of how children might deal with this. And when I say children of course it could be an adult that knows no programming a hobbyist or something but I mean, a non expert programmer.
5182000	5201000	That's very interesting. Thank you. It's also recently I listened to podcast is Lee chasen, which was an educator who also worked now on the content strategies, and he used role playing in the beginning like you did with the child to actually create a content for the
5201000	5217000	So in terms of how they can study the material because he was a teacher before, I think, teaching history, and uses this prompts like overall playing to actually create the tasks that the children would understand or certain
5218000	5228000	output that would be better suited for the audience so levels of understanding so I think what you also showed here is how well it works.
5228000	5241000	In terms of this first example that you show so that it really stands you nicely as if you were indeed a younger adult or child so
5242000	5256000	my question may be also additionally meant to ask what other techniques you found helpful like maybe not only role playing, but something else maybe some structuring or given examples.
5257000	5273000	Yeah, so part of the problem is that at the same time I was doing this I was also curious about, could it really understand me if I just say, you know,
5273000	5290000	maybe, etc, and I don't really list everything out or if I say, you know, that was it didn't go high enough without giving much detail so I was kind of really wanting to explore how how well I could do if I was
5290000	5302000	not being very careful to give it detailed instructions or large amount of context just to see, you know, could it still respond appropriately.
5302000	5324000	One thing I should say too is that, you know, the Khan Academy has been working with chat gpt to make a tutor that they gave a demo of teaching algebra, and it was really very very good at giving hints and giving feedback when the
5324000	5331000	student did things wrong, but the student said well what's the answer what's how do I solve this it'll keep saying.
5331000	5343000	I'm not going to give you the answer but here's a hint or something so it was they had set up the context appropriately so it would not.
5343000	5356000	You know, it would be a good pedagogical tutor and not be just a chat bot that would just give you answers when asked when asked for it but in my my case I thought.
5356000	5365000	I thought that it was, I could have maybe tried to early on say something like well you're giving me too much.
5365000	5379000	Code you know I want to be able to do more of it myself or something I could have done that and it would have taken me longer but it would have given me more hints and more little pieces to put together, but.
5379000	5395000	It was the way I did it I think was plausible for some students that you know would be happy with these pretty high level things and some copying pasting but also some creating things on their own.
5395000	5399000	Thank you.
5399000	5404000	Any more questions.
5404000	5407000	And thank you very, very much.
5407000	5419000	I love being educated in this in this area, and I qualify as a barely marginal student, I guess.
5419000	5428000	And what happens is I think that we see examples of reverse aging that the young kids are much more successful than the older people.
5428000	5434000	And, you know, I'd like to claim that I know how to do things, but oftentimes don't.
5434000	5437000	Thank you very much.
