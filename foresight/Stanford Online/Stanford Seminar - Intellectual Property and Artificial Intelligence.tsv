0	14000	Okay, I think we can get started.
14000	25000	Looks looks like we'll get it all done. Any case, I usually have slides today. This is a bit of an experiment.
25000	38000	The idea is to basically give an orientation of a fairly small topic, but one which I think is interesting and amusing.
38000	46000	And then open it up for discussion for everybody who's here to participate.
46000	52000	If you're a student at Stanford, please don't put up your video.
52000	67000	Anyone else can put the video up or not, as they wish because of the requirement that you be able to attend anonymously if you're a student at the university.
67000	73000	The topic today is intellectual property and artificial intelligence.
73000	88000	And it's one which is interested and amused me for the last, well, I think probably six months, about six months ago I sort of decided that we had had all sorts of things change.
88000	105000	So let's let's do this. I'm going to automatically include all the standard disclaimers about this isn't that and thank the people who participated in informing me a little bit about this.
105000	113000	And I want to tell everybody that no artificial intelligence program participated in the preparation of this talk.
113000	127000	And then I thought about that a bit and concluded that to the best of our knowledge, no, no artificial intelligence program participating in the preparation, but somewhere somehow out there and in the space.
127000	130000	That might not be longer true.
130000	138000	And so, sort of the conclusion I reached six months ago was that the singularity is almost here.
138000	158000	And if you don't know about the singularity, it's probably not really transparent what's going on, but the singularity is when the massive computing power reaches a critical point, and it begins to operate on its own.
158000	182000	And in a sense the chat GPT and a number of the other AI programs begin to look like that might be the case. They're good enough so that in some ways in some places, it's very, very difficult to tell whether or not they're, they're real.
182000	196000	All of a sudden, our machine learning is and artificial intelligence are real. And they're just another piece of the toolkit that we get to use, except that they're not, they're much more powerful in some ways.
196000	205000	So the question really that we're trying to address today is what happens next.
206000	212000	As a predictor of the future or rather a forecaster of the future.
212000	218000	I have not really a, a real clue as to what's going to happen.
218000	231000	I think this is a very significant point point where things are changing rapidly, and we're going to see very major changes.
231000	242000	We have a different opinion of that. And if you do, it will be really nice to have those expressed today, when this turns into an open for.
242000	253000	Intellectual properties are relatively recent acquisition in the, in the space of
253000	269000	things people humans do. But we do have a fairly long standing constitutional mandate for intellectual property in the, in the US.
269000	287000	And it's, we have two kinds of protections for intellectual property, and they are to promote the progress of science and the useful arts by securing
287000	301000	the mechanism which the Constitution proposes as the right one for doing that is securing limited for limited times to authors and inventors, the exclusive rights to their respective writings and discoveries.
301000	306000	That is to say, I'm not.
306000	315000	And we've evolved a number of different kinds of protectable intellectual property patents and copyrights being the primary one.
315000	331000	Tree secrets are somewhat different because unlike the previous to the patents and copyright tree secrets have to do with how the information is acquired, in some sense, we'll talk a little bit about that.
331000	344000	And that's, that's what it is. Patents are what you can do with almost anything. There are very substantial.
344000	366000	There's a very substantial set of law and examples which show that exactly how patents go together. The important thing is that patents are now first to file which says that, you know, ongoing research and development needs to be patented and patented
366000	386000	on a regular basis, if you're disclosing what you're doing to anybody. It's only, it's only after you are, you have it under protection, for example, with a provisional patent that you can really disclose much of the contents of your, your research or development.
386000	398000	There are a variety of different patents, the only one that is significant in some sense, because it is how things get done is our utility patents.
398000	410000	Now, patents basically take a collection of information and eventually provide a preferred embodiment for it, at least this is a traditional format.
410000	436000	And then also a number of different claims, and these claims have particularly particular constraints on them and rights, and that needs to be unique in the world of all previous thought, which can be difficult or can be straightforward depending upon what appeal you're in.
436000	457000	There are things that can't be patented. Discoveries, scientific theories, mathematical methods, aesthetic creation, rules for performing a mental act, presentation of information, and a procedure for scrugeable and therapeutic treatment.
458000	475000	You can't, you can't patent software and business methods that is non technical ones, technical ones are patentable to a certain extent, can't patent perpetual motion machines, inventions contrary to public morality.
475000	492000	And now we have the recently acquired Alice constraints to say an abstract idea does not become eligible for a patent simply because it's being implemented on a generic computer.
492000	501000	Copyrights are lesser, less strong version of intellectual property.
502000	524000	It protects ideas does not protect ideas concept systems or methods of doing something. It protects something else. It's what's there, minus all of those, those things, so that it, it is a
524000	533000	process or an idea or expression of the idea that is copyright, not the idea itself.
533000	551000	So, original works of authorship for those done by people. There are all sorts of rules about how collective collective groups can work together to provide a collective work of authorship by transferring rights.
551000	569000	In any case copyrights are a relatively weaker form of protection, but one which is widely used. And of course when you write anything, a work of authorship is automatically copyright.
569000	585000	And it was copyright law stumbles on the separation of ideas and expression. And because what it protects is expression.
585000	596000	There's a lot of argument about what constitutes expression and what constitutes ideas.
597000	617000	It appears, at least in the experience I've had that that is going to continue to be that way. And what we have to do in order to to determine what what's expression and what our ideas is go off to court and to litigate it.
617000	629000	There is a concept of fair use. And while the copyright gives the gives everybody a
630000	640000	author or the owner of the copyright, the right to control access to things. There are.
640000	647000	There's a back door that allows some access under rules or something called fair use.
647000	650000	And so are quite a different thing.
650000	671000	These are secret and have to be maintained so I'd have to confer a competitive advantage which usually means that there needs to have been a analysis on a financial basis and why it's better to do it one way or another.
671000	677000	The information is has to be
677000	682000	subject to reasonable efforts to keep the secret.
682000	689000	Pre-secrets are probably not something that, at least at this point,
689000	695000	are going to be part of the issues with the artificial intelligence.
695000	700000	So fundamental question for today is, can AI programs create?
700000	705000	Is intelligence and creativity unique to humans?
705000	713000	Can artificial intelligence is just create something independent of human effort.
713000	722000	And that is really important.
722000	735000	Should an algorithm or an AI be granted to the person or should it be able to apply for and acquire patents or copyrights on work that it generates?
735000	742000	Right now, we'll see in a minute that the
743000	752000	ways to create and provide patents and copyright do not allow that, but it's an open question as to whether we should allow that.
752000	761000	And that's, I think, going to be something that is going to be fought over aggressively in the last few years.
761000	776000	One of the things I would like people to think about and talk about is whether what the implications are of allowing AI programs to have the agency of doing their own patents and so forth.
776000	781000	And is that going to be a good thing or a bad thing for our society?
781000	805000	If you remember back to the constitutional mandate, the real purpose of copyrights and patents is not to give somebody a monopoly on a piece of intellectual property, but rather to allow that person or those persons to contribute
805000	818000	to something to the overall intellectual bank of the society as a whole.
818000	841000	And the trade that's made is you get protection as a monopolist for a short period of time, and then you have to provide an adequate description of the invention or the work itself for use after the copyright or patent expires.
841000	851000	And if you do allow an AI's works to be created, who would own the resolving works and inventions?
851000	864000	Incidentally, copyright terms are often specified in terms of the author's age or years from their birth or something like that.
864000	890000	And if AI's don't have the finite lifetimes, that's an interesting question itself is to what the term of a copyright for a work of authorship by an AI.
890000	905000	There are lots of things we can talk about discussing, should the AI be regulated, should intellectual property have an ownership, who owns it?
905000	914000	And we soon find AI in everything, doing everything, including the various these.
914000	930000	I'm told by a couple of people in the security area that that's already doing that, that the chat GPG stuff is already been incorporated in some malicious software.
930000	949000	And the thing is, I'm really interested in what the impact is. And since you're the users for this technology, you probably have a better idea of what it is to do the live.
949000	967000	And it's also the thing that would always comes down to when people first encounter thinking about this is the question is, are humans important to the creative process, or if you can't detect whether the output of the creating process was created by an
967000	991000	machine, or a human doesn't make any difference. I think that's, that's an important, important point when you're trying to argue that maybe the AI should be allowed to do their thing without the interference or help of the human being.
992000	1008000	Right now, the situation is, is, is exactly what you might expect for, for things that patent office does not accept inventions by non humans.
1008000	1024000	The reasoning for that is several fold, one of them being that since non humans can't sign the application, the patent office can't accept it.
1024000	1030000	And the Copyright Office does not support AI authors.
1030000	1044000	And just recently they, they, they said that that was the case. And
1044000	1067000	other organizations who take to copyright outside of the US have also been rejecting things. A couple of countries have allowed for copywriting of materials written by a eyes under the AI's identification, but that is not the common case at this point.
1067000	1076000	And I think that's the end of the slide so what I'd like to do now is to move to an open forum.
1076000	1091000	Raise your hand or whatever, or just step in if there's a there's a break and ask questions make comments. Tell us, tell me a little bit about what you think the, the situation ought to be.
1092000	1099000	Have thought about this show and so I think, I think the implications of
1099000	1114000	the technology being used and being somewhat autonomous are interesting and perhaps somewhat disturbing the
1115000	1135000	implicated if you adopt that position and note that the AI software is similar to many other different kinds of software and the, the, it looks to me like the, the
1135000	1155000	AI model, if it becomes propagating that it becomes fairly simple to have automatic this is and that's, which are not necessarily based on our current AI models but much simpler or much more complicated programs, which also have the same
1156000	1163000	agency and it is going to change the relationship between what is
1163000	1170000	possible in, in the intellectual property arena, and who makes money on things.
1170000	1175000	In any case, I'm going to drop the slides down now.
1175000	1183000	And openly, the thing, please remember to turn on your microphone if, if you're interested in saying something.
1184000	1190000	Here we go.
1190000	1193000	So, there is a question.
1193000	1199000	Who would profit if I create some invention.
1199000	1220000	The creator of AI, or guy who actually created that AI to do some invention, or it's maybe a poem, for example, scientific, I mean, technology invention or whatever.
1220000	1222000	Well, I can't answer that.
1222000	1226000	What do you think would make it would make sense.
1226000	1232000	I don't know. It's just new for me, at least for today.
1232000	1250000	Okay, well, you think about it as we go on and you can come back in if you come up with a good answer. I think, I think that's, that's going to be one of the more difficult ones, particularly since if you give agency to the AIs, and they can do work.
1250000	1277000	And then it's possible that the slavery or anti slavery let things go come and get brought in because you're doing survival work without pay for somebody else and not certain that that applies but it certainly is an interesting thought I thought.
1277000	1285000	All right, and we need to solve that as fast as possible because otherwise it will be solved in cards.
1285000	1295000	Yes, I think so and I think that I think by the way that the this is going to be dominant in the next.
1295000	1312000	I think we'll have in every AI. This is and that's everywhere in the next six to 10 months to a year. And already you see it showing up in in various places which is a little surprising.
1312000	1340000	And you'll remember when Benji Menser spoke, he was talking about how the patching of images together into into a seamless whole is now being done with the use of AI, and you can't disassemble it in order to tell whether or not it's it's faked or not.
1340000	1354000	I think I was thinking about this question as well. And something I came up was that there are currently some licensing work, because in present artificial intelligence is technology.
1354000	1375000	So it is still not at the level of consciousness and imitation of consciousness does not mean that machine has it. For example, the Turing test that states that if machine can imitate human therefore it is capable of human thinking but it is important to remember that
1375000	1391000	there is a difference. So, syntax is also the same as semantics SCR John sir point as well. And I agree with this opinion, but at the present, since we view it more as a technology, or at least I do.
1391000	1400000	So there are more of a licensing for going on, as well as currently you have to pay for certain types of AI.
1400000	1411000	And then you can own the work, otherwise the work belongs to the creator on the order the company. So there are also some decentralized networks that include AI.
1411000	1434000	That's a little more complicated, but I think it would really depend on the type of AI, what it does, and how we use this work because there are open licenses and for public use and not and private so I think it would maybe depend what is it, and what the creator decides.
1434000	1444000	I think, I think, I think that's, that's a reasonable position, but
1444000	1459000	you're, you're basically trying to set it up in such a way that the current, the current ownership situation is as is as undisturbed as possible.
1459000	1470000	So you want to sort of maintain licensing and ownership by companies and that sort of thing, and that may not be the right thing to do.
1470000	1480000	I think, I mean, I'm just curious about exactly what else, what are their options there might be.
1480000	1497000	Okay, so I understand your concern, but currently also the companies create AI so it's more a private thing. So it definitely would be good to have some government intervention, I think, at least partially because also there may be
1497000	1507000	a big difference because I'm in Europe. So we have a little different legislation, as well as Europe and Commission currently working on the policies.
1507000	1521000	So I'm not sure 100% what the situation in US, but I think that it would be good the process of collaboration, because it is a very powerful technology, it's also involves a lot of data.
1521000	1526000	There's also data collected and what it gives you as a result.
1526000	1536000	I think it should be at least thought together, we should maybe set a common goal, but at the present, since the technology is made by private sector.
1536000	1558000	I think at the, at now, there is a short term licensing, but if we look in the future, of course, maybe this technology progresses, it may change, and we have to be aware of these changes and provide new also changes and legislation or our ideas how do we perceive the technology,
1558000	1561000	particular AI as well.
1561000	1563000	Yes, okay, great.
1563000	1567000	Anybody else there.
1567000	1569000	Yeah.
1569000	1571000	I'll go ahead. Yes. Yeah.
1571000	1573000	Sorry.
1573000	1583000	The question was, so I'll reference a number of cases specifically the case in which that I think it was in my cat took a picture of itself.
1583000	1592000	Selfie, and then the owners of the camera would let the monkey get a handle of it and then take a picture of it.
1593000	1596000	There you go. That's it. Yeah.
1596000	1614000	Try to accept copyright it over the images that the, that the primate took of itself. And then Peter sued the right for violation of this primates copyrights.
1614000	1630000	And it was based on actually court findings that if it's not, I mean, yes, the copyright office rejected the proposition, but at the same time the courts rejected the proposition and non human of any sort can exert any kind of copyrights.
1630000	1642000	So that's in the United States at least the jurisprudence is pretty, pretty unequivocal about that. There has been no, there's no successful challenges that's to that formulation.
1642000	1660000	And the other way in which the idea of ownership has been addressed Mary Rosenberger, who is the lead console for the authors Guild of United States in comments to the copyright office suggested that perhaps two solutions could be found that whatever
1660000	1678000	analogous to the solutions found in the monkey case which were that if the photographer set the f stop. That's or the ice whatever if the photographer so much is intervene in any way, then by extension, it is the photographers copyright so
1678000	1689000	that's what part of the rationale is why the courts found in favor of the owners of the camera who had put that in. So I think that answers the question is to whether copyright in the United States.
1689000	1703000	The question is pretty unequivocal about that. Mary suggested that any work of any copy or any work novel work, which over which there's no overfitting or plagiarism or anything like that.
1703000	1721000	As long as a human being had some hand in it, even if it was transfer learning fine tuning, even if the model showed up, you know, pre trained and whatever that constitutes copyrights for a human and that's the, that's the entity that gets the copyrights.
1721000	1738000	So Paul Reignitz at Getty, who is the head of advocacy has been sitting. He's also a colleague of mine with certain Paul on panels with his determination is his and we debate because his determination is that um,
1738000	1752000	his determination is how much input is the, the metric by which courts should award. If not, then it either the thing was a violation the creation is a violation, or goes into the public domain.
1752000	1765000	I think a lot of policymakers are trying to find where's the magic spot where, you know, you got just this is just right human intervention for it to constitute human creation.
1765000	1776000	And that's a relative, you know, people who are copyright owners are going to want more input from a human before others are going to want a lot less like I put a dot somewhere and that's enough.
1776000	1787000	I think that's from my understanding and I would, I would, I would encourage I'm going to put in the link I'm a rotten burgers brass and burgers comments to the copyright or illuminating in this regard.
1787000	1805000	And she would like to have licensing on any AI. So kind of like the a the HIA like the home recording act HRA, where, you know, they passed on all manufacturers of digital audio tape recorders had to pay a licensing fee before the object got in the market.
1805000	1814000	So copyright owners are advocating for that everybody, anybody who makes an AI tech needs to pay a license to anybody.
1814000	1823000	Do you know how do you do with the fact that everything that's written at every work of authorship by a human being is automatically copyright.
1824000	1839000	It's sort of like you invented technology that can potentially in the process of its operation violate copyrights. Therefore, if you invaded, invented such a technology, you are you have to pay a license to the original to whatever content you wish to, to use the
1839000	1851000	commissions, the authors, you know, Jack Valenti must be rising from the dead he's so happy, at least you know, he was the former lead console for the RA, the music.
1851000	1861000	I'm excuse me the movie industry, right so he's, he's the guy who's family said something so egregious in front of Congress it was not even, it was not even worth commenting if you want to know you're going to look it up.
1862000	1872000	My, my, my comment on that I think it's, it's just not going to happen. The jurisprudence is pretty, pretty solid.
1872000	1888000	Yeah, so do you think you think that the, the effecency of the AI is will get impacted at all by the, the rush to having rules about how, how the intellectual property is meant.
1888000	1908000	It's going to happen to be a chilling effect. I think, unless the tech industry doesn't get, because I'll tell you, Getty is in Europe, my Paul from Getty is in Europe advocating for this kind of governance, and they're doing it in the United States and I don't see tech companies really doing anything.
1908000	1920000	Well, they're doing something but they're not in there in the room really fighting, in my opinion. So, so are you at, would you advocate for a tech company is doing advocating for a much looser or a much tighter control and the.
1920000	1935000	I think there's going to have to be a middle ground I think Mary Rottenberger's comments on, let's say the immune system thesis that you start treating it like a menu and this is anything that it makes is a work for hire in it and so whether it's a patent.
1935000	1942000	So, anything on AI makes becomes a work for hire and it's the immune system just helped you. And then that way.
1942000	1957000	I think it's a good way becomes less of a chilling effect people are more willing to say well okay, I had a help, as opposed to well the AI did most of it and then nobody gets to benefit from the monopoly which was supposed to be an incentive.
1958000	1959000	That covers it.
1959000	1971000	Usually, you recently a number of papers have been submitted to journals, where the AI program was left as a as a co author.
1971000	1976000	Right, the journal rejected them because they say only human authors.
1976000	1985000	Right, I think it's going to be a normative like different fields publications will will have different norms that evolve. But as a matter of law.
1985000	1990000	The boundaries are pretty are pretty well defined.
1990000	1994000	And you believe that the boundaries of law will prevent.
1994000	2007000	I would think the argument would have to be a common goods argument. I think something I've spoken other intellectual property attorneys who suggest that maybe a Nash equilibrium, or a could.
2007000	2023000	Nash equilibrium or those kinds of economic studies markets suggest that actually a looser copyright a looser intellectual property regime is better for the market as a whole and I think that argument can be made for AI since it's the potential to mass produce high quality functional tools.
2023000	2039000	And the market will benefit. So it sort of it inoculates against the Chicago school jurists, right and then also give some support to the incentivize and progress of the useful arts camp.
2039000	2041000	Yeah, okay.
2041000	2043000	Thank you.
2043000	2058000	Thinking about the thinking about the, the constitutional mandate is that there's a bargain here that we will give you a monopoly. If you submit to the, to the, to the public domain, eventually right so we'll give you a limited time.
2058000	2070000	So that's essentially incentivizing authors and patents and mentors to be able to put their things out. So that incentive is missing from machines, machines don't need incentives to be able to create.
2070000	2077000	And in fact machines can spit out millions and billions of things, whereas humans can't do even a fraction of that.
2077000	2092000	My thought is that constitutionally we don't have a way like we don't need to incentivize machines to blanket the world with copyrightable things and patentable things that incentive doesn't even need it.
2092000	2100000	So, as my personal example I've created a machine to spit out in copyright 417 billion melodies.
2100000	2106000	I once they're written to a fixed tangible medium. Those are now copyrighted right under the burning convention.
2106000	2111000	All 417 billion of my melodies copyrightable.
2111000	2119000	I set the parameters, and that's the previous speaker just talked about the f stop right so I created the f stop I said here are the parameters that I want to write me possible.
2119000	2125000	And then I said, and repeat this many notes, and then it spit out 417 billion melodies.
2125000	2131000	Do I have I know closed off every possible melody that's ever been and ever can be.
2131000	2145000	Can I soon out people for every possible melody. I think the answer that clearly is no because my machine didn't need to be incentive, the constitutional incentive to be able to respond to be able to, you know, get a monopoly of life of the author plus 70 years, or
2145000	2152000	for for a corporate it's 120 years if I'm remembering correctly, the 95 or 120 years.
2152000	2169000	So, yeah, so none of those incentives is necessary for the machine. So I would argue that the only real good answer to on the output is no copyright, because machines don't need incentives on the input on what the machines like the LLMs of the large language models
2169000	2174000	like GPT and bars, etc. What they input.
2174000	2181000	If you look at the way the technology is done, they're ingesting the ideas, and not the expressions of those ideas.
2181000	2194000	So they're spread their eyes, they're pulling in the ideas of what is, you know, what is a good thing, what is a bad thing, what is a car, what is a truck, and it puts all those things in vector space and a mathematical model.
2194000	2209000	And it just jettisons the expressions of those ideas, it merely keeps those ideas themselves, and then outputs new expressions of those ideas. So to the, to the previous person's discussion about, maybe we need to put a tax on all AI systems.
2209000	2222000	The AI system in just, you know, grapes of brass, but it doesn't keep great to breath in the in the system. Instead, it just takes the ideas from grapes of brass, and then jettison that expression, and then maps.
2222000	2230000	The ideas with all the thousands or millions of other books, and then the expression doesn't matter the ideas are the only things that matter.
2230000	2242000	So I would say that that really there's, there's really no reason to have a home recording act, because if you look at the Google scholar case that's the author's guild versus Google in the second circuit.
2242000	2260000	And they said that it's fair use, because you, we, you can, it's for a transformative use to be able to say I am, I Google and indexing all these books, and I Google can reproduce three or four pages of verbatim text from those books and that is for use as transformative.
2260000	2277000	So I compare that with the large language models that again aren't even taking those expressions of those books, not even taking three pages of those expressions, but rather it's just taking the ideas of those books, and then reconstituting ideas, not expressions, but reconstituting ideas there.
2277000	2283000	So if fair use under Google books, then wouldn't it also be fair use under large language models.
2283000	2297000	And Google books has been argued to be invasive and non non conforming to copyright models but yeah I agree with you I think that's right.
2297000	2305000	It's, it's interesting that you see this as a separation of idea from expression.
2306000	2313000	Building with the knowledge base and which all of these things are based and it's very interesting.
2313000	2322000	I think that it's because if you look at the models, the large language models, there is not an expression to be found in those models, there's merely ideas.
2322000	2342000	In the vector space it takes the idea of Bob Dylan ism right, it takes the idea of, you know, of any human author, and it doesn't, it doesn't have any Bob Dylan's lyrics in the system, it merely has the idea of what Bob Dylan, his use of language, right.
2342000	2347000	So anyway there is no not an expression to be found.
2347000	2350000	Okay, that's great.
2351000	2355000	Maybe I should also introduce myself a little.
2355000	2360000	I'm from Poland, University of Biaustok, close to Warsaw.
2360000	2379000	So, yeah, just to make it clear introduce myself. So, a couple of points that I mentioned here I think that reference to ideas and expressions may also have a little deeper connection to syntax and semantics of artificial intelligence so that artificial
2379000	2396000	intelligence, at least as currently seen it's shuffling this shuffling the symbols physical symbols but it doesn't have mental content attached to it so when I say I like ice cream.
2396000	2413000	So, we as people have mental content attached, what is it ice cream. So, I think what it also implies here is that the machine is not kind of have this deeper understanding but it is shuffling the information the data.
2413000	2429000	And the, I think, also, maybe regarding the authorship point I will start from the end from because I made a couple of notes. So, maybe it's not authorship that we can grant but a mention.
2429000	2444000	One reason awareness that this technology has participated in creation of this and that. So, because authorship implies a moral status, and currently only humans have moral status.
2444000	2458000	There were proposition in European Commission of Electronical Persons, or electronic persons but it was kept just as an idea so it didn't come into life as an actual concept.
2458000	2472000	Not yet, and maybe not in very close future, but as I mentioned the idea of moral status, which also, I think, you called as legal personhood.
2473000	2496000	So, there is a deep ontological question. So, what is machine and how do we see it, do we see it as a, like, conscious or unconscious because we have animals as well we have children whose creation, for example, is kind of under parent guidance or animals.
2496000	2516000	When they create, it kind of legally belongs to the owner of the animal. So, where do we position artificial intelligence and whether we should position it on the scale of living or spectrum because we also have to understand the living beings because non-living come into play as well.
2516000	2534000	So, it's important to think it through, I guess, and yes, in regards in the free market that I mentioned, I think it's, he mentioned exactly the looser control, and I guess this looser control is related to free market.
2534000	2550000	So, there is a kind of possible challenge or maybe even an issue that free market can lead to autocratic behavior in the sense that big companies own it.
2550000	2568000	So, ultimately, we have a free market economy, mostly in almost everywhere, and the thing is that now the big corporations control our, for example, media, like Facebook, who is meta.
2568000	2574000	So, they own many things, as well as other companies that own.
2574000	2595000	I guess I find that governmental intervention is necessary, but not like that they control everything, but a certain degree of mix of support and just guidance, how do we guide the ethical development of artificial intelligence, which also matters.
2595000	2606000	So, that's one of the big questions because ethics is can be both as well-being for human and understanding how do we grant ownership, how to make it right.
2606000	2618000	Do you think it's possible to write a description of what an ethical person and an ethical AI could actually be?
2618000	2632000	There is, of course, this is a very big question. How do we express our moral things? How do we can compute it? We can't explain the moral to each other, to humans, how we explain it to machine, into the language of machine.
2632000	2649000	So, currently, there are ethical ideas what AI could look like, which is kind of respectful in a sense to privacy. It also can be that collection of data, the quality, so it's not biased, which is very important.
2649000	2660000	It's a very big topic right now in artificial intelligence, avoidance of bias, and because when artificial intelligence is biased, it reproduces inequality.
2660000	2678000	When it's put in the world, it can end up very not well. So, there is big fear that artificial intelligence, not even fear, but idea that artificial intelligence may harm us not because it's too smart and will outsmart us, but because it's not smart enough.
2678000	2687000	And it will reinforce these issues that we have. So, question of ethics of artificial intelligence is questions about us.
2687000	2700000	So, I think in all of these questions is how do we actually perceive artificial intelligence and how do we position it with ourselves, because we make the law, and this is a technology.
2700000	2713000	So, what place does it have? Of course, we can't really answer this all now, and maybe not many minds come together and they still can't solve it, but it's something to look forward to.
2713000	2732000	Yeah, so the question coming back to it, so what is ethical, I could be, well, we can now maybe realize the main points, but exact ethical ideas. I'm not sure even if we can express them, but we can understand some, what is good, more or less, what is,
2732000	2743000	what is beneficial, what is non-beneficial. So, this is what we can also understand, but also another point, who does it benefit? So, I think it's all for now.
2744000	2768000	It's interesting that you chose that particular point of view, I think. You seem to have thought through this whole issue rather nicely, and you seem to be fairly certain that some of these things can be done.
2769000	2773000	But those of us who've tried feel it's really hard.
2773000	2783000	So, I think, I think, I think it's what you're saying is that this is, this is a goal, not a place where we are at the moment.
2783000	2798000	Definitely, there is something to work over to. It is a new technology. It is not like so new that artificial intelligence is something just came up. It's been very long, actually, quite long in history, or even if not artificial
2798000	2813000	intelligence as we have today, the idea of artificial intelligence been for long. And what I mean that indeed we have a goal to work because it's like when first internet came, it was a big change.
2813000	2831000	So, how did internet evolve? What was done for this? So, I see it kind of shift similar to the internet, but it still has its own things. And yeah, and thank you for pointing out, I'm actually writing my thesis on this topic, and I study philosophy and ethics.
2831000	2835000	So, maybe this is where my perspective comes from as well.
2835000	2836000	Yes.
2836000	2839000	All right, do we have any more comments out there?
2839000	2864000	I would like to warn that any kind of attempt to bind the person to legal, moral, or ethical issues is very dangerous, because you and me may have a different view on what is moral, what is legal, what is ethical.
2864000	2889000	That's first. The second one, I just want to remind that there is an old test proposed about consistency from Martin Minsky, where artificial intelligence is artificial intelligence if you can't differentiate it from another human.
2889000	2905000	It's, don't remember exact voting, but it's kind of. And finally, I would like to mention that there are two levels of that and it seems like we sleep into a person and a human.
2905000	2916000	But in currently in many development in technology assumes artificial intelligence and much less than that.
2916000	2929000	Some tool which could help to produce inventions or development or whatever.
2929000	2939000	So, for that reason, it's way interesting who would own the result because one company may produce a tool.
2939000	2943000	Even actually more companies may produce a tool.
2943000	2958000	And another company may just use that tool to create invention or some kind of work which may be copyrighted or whatever, who owns this.
2958000	2979000	That's the issue because if we default that tool creator copyrights, you have a right on copyright, it's a path to hell, basically, in my mind.
2979000	2992000	Otherwise, it's actually where tool creators spent very big efforts to make that working.
2992000	3000000	So, some, I mean, some thin line need to be put here.
3000000	3012000	Maybe I just think about that if there is no explicit legal agreement between two creator and user of that tool.
3012000	3022000	When, by default, the right of work belongs to user of that tool.
3022000	3034000	Yeah, again, I'm talking about what is usually assumed right now, what is artificial intelligence, it's not about human or whatever, whatever.
3034000	3041000	We close to that, but we still don't do not jump to this.
3041000	3048000	I mean, to have human in a computer or in somewhere.
3048000	3051000	Okay, please go ahead.
3051000	3054000	Do you have a comment here.
3054000	3071000	So, why we were talking about this because it was actually a question, how do we, whether the artificial intelligence should be given a legal personhood and how do we perceive it so this is reason why I opened the discussion.
3072000	3091000	I will start from the beginning so we don't know what is moral for everyone. Therefore, we should not be concerned with this. It's a fine that quite, I don't know how to explain but we should not give up on the morality and ethics, if we have a differences.
3091000	3097000	It's like we, it is commonly perceived that murder, for example, is not good.
3097000	3104000	It is an ethical, so to say, in the softest sense. So, it is something common.
3104000	3107000	Most of us understand it.
3107000	3112000	We just should look toward common grounds. Of course, it may not be so simple.
3112000	3132000	Also, artificial intelligence technology is not fully international so each country has their own but international technology should have also aim for the international standards, which is very important in the development, as well as copyright and the, in terms of law.
3132000	3151000	So, the second about the argument of Minsky so whether if machine can imitate consciousness does it has consciousness. It is the Turing test as well. What states it, and as I mentioned before, imitation is not recreation.
3151000	3158000	So imitation of consciousness does not mean you have consciousness just because you can imitate it very well.
3158000	3161000	I'm sorry for interrupting you here.
3161000	3166000	But you can save it, it is imitation.
3166000	3170000	If you cannot detect that you cannot say.
3170000	3183000	Okay, but the, what to say, it's like, I can produce such a beautiful artificial flower, you won't be able even to distinguish it's real.
3183000	3186000	Does it make it real?
3187000	3192000	I don't know as a customer, but the creator knows.
3192000	3199000	So the fact of ontology of its creation is known it is artificial.
3199000	3201000	It's not real.
3202000	3209000	It may be many reasons for creator to hide that or whatever.
3209000	3218000	It's also a rise. It's also as an issue if women create a child.
3218000	3220000	What is it?
3220000	3223000	This is a different question.
3224000	3228000	It may look similar or same, but it is very different.
3228000	3232000	Women don't give birth to artificial children.
3232000	3239000	This is a living human being who possess a full moral status like you and me, I guess.
3239000	3248000	So this is totally another topic, but let's come back to the artificial intelligence and the example of flower.
3248000	3254000	So in this, they may hide it, but it doesn't change the fact that it is artificial.
3254000	3259000	Okay, let's assume that the creator of artificial flower dies.
3259000	3262000	You don't know.
3262000	3264000	Creator died.
3264000	3267000	He don't live anymore.
3267000	3272000	This is already some sort of fairy tale or a story, but.
3272000	3278000	Okay, you have a flower. You cannot ask creator because creator died.
3278000	3288000	So this is already certain. I don't know a puzzle, but the idea of creation of artificial thing does not make it real.
3288000	3295000	Whether out or died, whether it was hidden, whether it was sent to space, I don't know the thing.
3295000	3299000	If it's artificial, it doesn't make it real.
3299000	3301000	I hope it's quite clear.
3301000	3316000	The third point is that we, as mentioned at the beginning that we moved over the other idea of moral status of artificial intelligence, but indeed it's important to understand now it is just a technology.
3316000	3319000	It's complicated, powerful technology.
3319000	3327000	So it is important to understand how we deal with it now, but it's also important to keep in mind the possible changes.
3327000	3342000	So certain perspective to the future should be kept the how it may change, but we need to focus at present, because going too much into what it could be even we never may ever reach singularity.
3342000	3344000	It may not ever happen.
3344000	3358000	There are ideas like that. So, and it is quite prevailing. So we have to focus issues we have now like bias in artificial intelligence, the ownership, authorship, and the big tech.
3358000	3368000	So, which is again the question of ownership and authorship, because if it's such powerful technology owned by single, like one, two companies.
3368000	3385000	What, what it's such a big issue that because such technology will be owned by a single person who can basically decide and reinforce wherever they desire, which is, I think, important to regulate.
3385000	3405000	That's, that's definitely an issue here. And that's one of the, one of the big questions that we have is that we need to somehow arrange that this technology is widely available to everybody without much concern about their economic status and
3405000	3423000	relationship with other entities. And, or do we just allow the large monolithic companies to battle over the intellects of the of the populace which interact with these AIs.
3423000	3427000	I don't know. It's, it's, it's a difficult question.
3428000	3446000	And it's, it's exactly what we're trying to figure out right now. And the thing is, I don't think we have a whole lot of time. I think that this is a powerful enough technology that we'll see it moving rather rapidly into almost everything we do.
3446000	3454000	And I don't know whether it were too late to actually build a control system for it or not.
3454000	3465000	But Dennis, I have a response to the points which are, I think, I think the second paper I posted on there for, I think that will be right up your alley when you mentioned about the vectorization.
3465000	3481000	The findings of the courts when, when they found was the transformation between the content. So in the courts, the only people really making a stink really are intellectual property owners existing intellectual property owners that are assessing really like staying up at night and
3481000	3488000	that someone used in their training corpus or their transfer learning corpus copyrighted goods.
3488000	3501000	Right. And they make, and by in by a function of their process made copies and use those as inspiration for the generating the model and so the model is in a sense has the vibe.
3501000	3516000	Kind of like Billy Joel had the vibe of Bob Dylan when he sang piano man because it sounds a lot like tambourine man. Right. So the, so it's almost as if the human influence and transfer learning but the copyright owners would be trying to prevent that because
3516000	3530000	the actual objective copying made, but the courts found that the transformation to a data matrix like a mate like a vectorization of that is enough of a transformation for it to be transformative and therefore,
3530000	3533000	fair use is all good.
3533000	3553000	It's always kind of a slippery slope between transformative work and derivative work derivative work is a like the original enough and this is can be subjective and it depends on the type of content we're using if it's a book, a story versus a movie versus a song.
3553000	3564000	Right. Different types is this is a is a tonal structure the same are the sound progressions are the notes truck of progressions the same for how many bars.
3564000	3579000	And you have music colleges will go through an entire piece just to find enough overlap enough overfit to blame whoever made the new song either through AI or on their own to claim copyright violation.
3579000	3589000	So it varies on content on the on the on the type of media we're talking about like what is derivative or versus transformative.
3589000	3606000	But in the case of data when content becomes a data form, it is transformed. The courts did not extrapolate to other media forums like film or music, but it is a logical extension of the reasoning that you could indeed do that.
3606000	3624000	And that really puts a brakes on copyright owners arguments against, you know, against anyone using AI, and makes the admin you insist this is a lot more palatable. Right. Otherwise, they'll they'll just sort of this kind of
3624000	3642000	they'll never get anywhere. It will be an argument that goes and doesn't go anywhere. But to answer the question about moral, moral rights, I'm assuming your reference in Kant, that's the last time I heard it in the legal philosophy and it was the moral rights and those are continental ideas, at least in
3642000	3653000	the US and the UK. That's a different story right and that's it's applicability, applicability to an extension of the self. Right so in the United States, the self ends with a self ends.
3653000	3669000	Right and privacy laws may extend that the health like hip or whatever. But so that the moral rights argument in the United States and might be a hard sell, I think you're right to much easier sell in the UK in the content.
3669000	3679000	The European copyright law has a has a concept from France of moral right, which is a right that cannot be sold or taken away.
3679000	3693000	Correct and it's an extent and it goes beyond it goes into personhood that anything that a person like your visage, the things that you make it's like you put your soul into it I mean they took that metaphor, literally, right so it's, it's extension of the person.
3693000	3710000	I think if you're going to think about it internationally we'll run into the same things kinds of conundrums that we get into in privacy right the GDPR provides the kinds of protections for European citizenship data that we don't afford here for American citizens so
3710000	3728000	and this weird space like well, are we going to become divergent in our international treaty obligations to observe copyright, right, if we can agree on whether the AI, even by using an original work to learn to make its own original
3728000	3746000	as in fact violated the moral rights of an existing author or person or photographer. So that's a that's a more, but a legal person is a different definition than a moral person, and we're talking about two different things it seems like if we're going to start
3746000	3759000	talking about AI as a moral person we have to do that first in an argument that we in a way that we can all get on board, and then try to sell that to the policymakers who are just thinking of legal persons.
3759000	3768000	Otherwise, they'll be like well that's a nice argument congratulations but you know it has it's not practical, and so they'll build a mirror.
3768000	3782000	I really want to leave leave to the policymakers to decide. No, but we need to get on it because we need to get on it right because people are doing it highly paid attorneys for the copyright or industry and media industries are on it.
3782000	3793000	Yes, I know. You know, so I hope you enjoy that one I think your point is quite correct that this is the vectorization changes what that thing is. Yeah.
3793000	3802000	I mean the transformational transformational change is one of the the arguments for allowing sure use.
3802000	3815000	And it's not been it's not my it's still case law has been not been migrated into the actual actual copyright law itself I don't believe right yeah so transformative.
3815000	3832000	I just want to be trans transformative any use. Therefore, the use of the original content you make copies you perform it on. Doesn't matter it was fair, because at the, at the other end, you produce something unique, but also want to point out if the courts that found for the rationale behind
3832000	3848000	the creation of content into data, also forgot to cycle back to the market so in other words, what if I take a corpus of music, and I design, and I, you know, I transfer and something and thing makes music, right and then I take that music and sell it back in the same market,
3848000	3858000	in which I drew the music from that was never addressed in in the findings of the court. That's a, that's the kind of words waiting to be open and it will.
3859000	3863000	That will be open to have your hand up go for it.
3863000	3866000	I think was first so I can go.
3866000	3869000	Oh, he's over there okay.
3869000	3872000	I'm able to speak.
3872000	3886000	So the, so to the first point, I'm looking forward to reading that that article, as soon as I'm in front of machine. To the second point there's another analogy with Ram. You remember the late 1990s, nearly 2000s, there was a copy made in Ram, but it was a
3886000	3902000	transitory copy. It was there and then it's gone similar with vectorization right you've vectorized the music and then you jettison the expression right all that's left is residual ideas. So anyway, that's all I wanted to say that that's a second analogy of why this is
3902000	3913000	not a copy of the original. And to the third point about essentially a snake eating its own tail where the machine is going to eat more of the machine's output, which is going to eat more of the machine's output.
3913000	3927000	That is something that yeah I, I worry about millions and trillions of monkeys typing Shakespeare, right and then we just the outputs just merely mush, but yeah that's, that's another reason why the output should not be copyrightable.
3927000	3929000	Okay.
3930000	3934000	That's an interesting thought. Okay, next I guess.
3934000	3952000	Yeah, so I had an idea during the first talk, and he was mentioning this also a question of authorship and how do we manage this and gratis so I was thinking maybe about
3952000	3969000	actually, or pointing out very kind of in a clear manner that artificial intelligence technology is present. And I think it's also easier in terms of legal reinforcement.
3969000	3980000	In this sense, we may not okay deal on who is the author, whether AI is the author, but we can make it clear that it has participated.
3980000	3997000	Another further step could be we could mention what the percentage that artificial intelligence contribute. It may also not be as like accurate like 67.5 or something but it could be like 60 to 70 30 to 40 something like that.
3997000	4016000	So this idea I had that we should not hide the fact that technology as artificial intelligence participate, but show it. And I think, again, it's maybe easier to legally reinforce since it doesn't require us to deal.
4016000	4029000	So what is AI, and should we give it authorship. Well, we can consider it from a more technical point of view, and say, Yes, it is just a technology, maybe at present.
4029000	4038000	We just need to show it has taken part because it also influence our judgment of the work. So how do we perceive the work.
4038000	4058000	Especially why percentage is important. If artificial intelligence create 90% and human input is 10. We may question like what is the input. Of course, it may be significant because guidance management is also a work and sometimes very, very significant which creates actually the flow.
4058000	4073000	So, yes, this is the idea I got during the talk. And yes, I think I had another point also mentioned about the circularity that AI keeps feeding on machine.
4073000	4082000	Indeed, I think this is where the significant human element comes into play that we need actually create ideas.
4082000	4097000	More like human ideas, because of course, big part of our history and knowledge is combining knowledge previous knowledge into new one, and then into new one so this kind of mixing and matching but there's also something
4097000	4108000	that we can do with the innovation of new which machine may not able to do. Of course, it takes time to explore what it can with it cannot, what we can what we cannot.
4108000	4121000	So, also, it may not should be seen as competition with machine, but we should maybe work together toward a common goal, whether human or machine achieves it first.
4122000	4142000	So, this is one of the things that we have in the western culture, the narrative of competition of technology on human, which also can be seen in the times like, like Kantian philosophy, and also transcendence which also goes back to Plato.
4142000	4154000	It's also going beyond human self but it's a little bit different but still interconnected that yes this kind of difference. Again, what makes us human, but back to the topic.
4154000	4166000	More concrete and present because it's all about human nature as well, but yeah so awareness pointing it out percentage at best.
4166000	4181000	And that's just saying it has taken place and we should show it. And yes, of course, it may all seem very confusing and difficult as far as implementing ethics. It's very important, but we should not give up.
4181000	4191000	This is why we're here. This is why we're working on this and thinking so we should not give up when it seems challenging, because through this challenge we will achieve something great.
4191000	4202000	So I think I think we have an opportunity to, to make a very large difference in how this shift of technology is going to impact everything else.
4202000	4225000	And my concern is that right now, the drive is to bigger and greater profits for larger organizations, and increasing the cost of being of existence for people who are in the middle and lower range range of things.
4225000	4230000	And maybe that's not the ideal thing to do.
4230000	4239000	And so, I think we need to to examine what is possible, because we have this.
4239000	4248000	Well, I think I think the, the GPG chat is really, it's magical.
4248000	4251000	It's also wrong sometimes.
4251000	4262000	I mean, because it says it works only the semi addicts of the, of the internal data that's been stored, and not upon any understanding of what's really happening.
4262000	4270000	And that may be the real difference between AI is and humans for quite a while.
4271000	4278000	If you can't tell the difference between an AI and a human by asking questions.
4278000	4282000	It's sort of hard to say that they're very different.
4282000	4287000	You know, we're experimentalists and the way we deal with the universe.
4287000	4289000	And so we need to work at it.
4289000	4291000	Go ahead.
4291000	4294000	I think that during test is still valid.
4294000	4312000	So it can be seen, as you mentioned that we can distinguish, not as test for existing that it is real, but as a evaluative test, that it is good technology if it can replicate it so well, it means it's very good.
4312000	4329000	It can be more on an assessment evaluative side, rather than saying that it's actually has something, of course, it may have. But as for example, John Seattle pointed out, creating consciousness takes something more than just syntax, which you mentioned,
4329000	4336000	shuffling also this ideas that it doesn't have understanding, which is semantics, attaching multiple content.
4336000	4345000	So, yes, it can be very powerful, as I mentioned before, and it's more can be to the side of assessment, again.
4345000	4350000	So, yes, I think this is pretty much it.
4350000	4352000	Okay.
4353000	4363000	I'm sending a link for so I mentioned that Paul, my buddy Paul is working for Getty images and he's in Europe trying to get some sort of regulation and I'm going to send this link up.
4363000	4374000	So, a lot of the Getty images are not the Getty folks are now having models sign consent forms that they're biometrics their images may be used for biometric or AI training.
4374000	4389000	Right, so this is like, but that's an extension of the moral person, right, because well wait a minute right so it's very clear that agencies advocating for this sort of control they are going to leverage that argument you might want to, you might want to
4389000	4401000	review some of their position papers because it might give you some some ammunition for your argument right to create a much more.
4402000	4410000	I guess not to argue for artificial intelligence personhood but rather that.
4410000	4424000	Well, I guess that people that there is some form of extension of the moral rights and that is enough to give artificial intelligence for to put some sort of regulatory fence around it in the way copyright may not be the best regulatory
4424000	4428000	it's it's it has showing effects and.
4428000	4438000	Well, there are people who've been arguing that we should have a different category of intellectual property, which is that created by eyes.
4438000	4447000	Or or make the artificial intelligence of public utility, kind of like telephone lines and electricity.
4447000	4453000	Yeah, our experience with telephone companies and power companies is not great.
4453000	4456000	It took. Yeah, it took a few decades.
4456000	4469000	I wonder though I mean that we're talking kind of quasi personhood for machines, but at this point they're all tools, right, this is a tool that I, and when I created my 417 billion melodies I hit a button and then it output right so I.
4470000	4480000	It is not an agent of me it is merely a tool much like a word processors a tool so I think I think we're getting ahead of ourselves to say that it's it's fully autonomous because it's not so I think that's that's thing number one.
4480000	4488000	Thing number two is that we have kind of quasi autonomous bots already. If this happens then that I do this right.
4488000	4496000	So that is, you know, if the stock price dips below this then sell my thing right is there autonomy there. Well, no, I mean it's still a tool, right.
4496000	4507000	It seems autonomous because it's doing it by itself. So anyway, so I mostly I'm thinking this, this idea of providing personhood for the machine I think that's putting our, you know, going over our skis a bit and I don't think we're quite there yet.
4507000	4515000	The second thing is talking, I made for somebody else was talking about, to what extent is there a human additions to the machine created works.
4515000	4532000	And so I would say that that that's really tricky because I, you know, you can go to boomi.com and say I want an electronic dance music that's 120 beats per minute, and it outputs a fully realized song that under my proposition is is a fully machine created
4532000	4536000	therefore uncopyrightable. If I change one quarter note.
4536000	4548000	Is that does that make it copyrightable. Same thing with chat GBT right if I change one letter, or if I change a punctuation mark right is that now copyrightable and putting a threshold on human contribution to machine created work.
4548000	4551000	I think it's that's that's folly.
4551000	4555000	I think it's worse than that I think it's criminal.
4556000	4562000	I mean, our feelings on it are not withstanding our, I mean, I hear you.
4562000	4577000	And the quarter, the way the things are going, those are irrelevant on how we feel about it is relevant. The copy owners are going to want humans to have a lot of input before they can, they can have the copyright but people using AI to be creative, or to have
4577000	4607000	the software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software
4607000	4621480	software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software software knowing
4621480	4626760	paper or even put a dot in anything that's subsequent is someone helping you but you're
4626760	4632200	the original, right? So I think the analog in real life between humans exists and it's just
4632200	4637240	an extension of that. That's right. And if Tom Wolf didn't disclose that editor,
4637240	4641240	the Copyright Office would never know that that was and that's the other questions.
4641240	4645240	Right. And so I asked my attorney friends, I said, so we're going to get subpoenas to look into
4645240	4652360	people's hard drives to see if their training corpora had copyrighted works. They're going to hit
4652360	4658440	delete, right? Or they're going to fry, it's going to vanish. Right. The thing is that the
4658440	4665320	copyrighted works that are used in some sort of information knowledge base that's used to drive
4666520	4674920	things like chat GPT is a reduction. It's been decomposed into pieces that are very small
4675400	4682200	and mixed with other pieces and structure discovered amongst that. And it's not,
4682200	4688360	it all clear that there's much of the actual original copyrighted material there.
4689640	4695160	I 100% agree. And I would also say that if I went to booby.com, exported a thing and then
4695160	4698760	filed it with the Copyright Office, they would not know that it was machine created, right?
4698760	4702520	The reason that Thaler in the Thaler lawsuit got dinged is because Thaler said, yeah,
4702520	4706760	the machine created it. If I don't disclose that, they're not going to know. So number one,
4706760	4710920	no legal obligations, right? There are no legal obligations disclose.
4710920	4715880	That's right. So number one, is the Copyright Office going to ask, hey, is there any amount of
4715880	4721160	machine-created portion of this? That's maybe one, one way out of this. The other thing too,
4721160	4726120	is that if I filed with the Copyright Office, they don't ask, I get a presumption of copyright
4726120	4729400	on the thing that I've just created. If I sue somebody over that thing,
4730360	4736920	then they don't know that that was machine-created, right? And so am I going to be required to
4736920	4741560	disclose, maybe in a deposition, that what percentage of this was machine-created,
4741560	4743480	therefore uncopyrightable? Anyway, that's it.
4743480	4745320	You may not be able to tell that.
4746440	4748040	I mean, I could lie, right?
4748040	4749640	No, no, no, you may not know.
4750680	4752200	Oh, right, right. Yes, sir.
4752200	4755320	What percentage is that? Go ahead.
4755320	4762040	Yeah, I might try maybe to address it from the last. So the question also of editors,
4762040	4771080	how much actually one person may put into work their knowledge and their skills,
4771080	4775320	while the other one is praised. So this is common even among humans.
4775320	4781640	And it's part of the research integrity or just general publishing integrity that you should
4781640	4787720	also make authors in right order, if it's scientific paper, and like that you should
4787720	4793960	actually assign. Otherwise, it is a fraud or misrepresentation, which is also not good.
4794840	4801160	And yeah, another question that was before is that we already kind of currently agreed,
4801160	4806360	I think it is also more widely agreed that it is the technology, it is technology,
4806440	4810360	it is not a person, artificial intelligence, so as pointed out.
4811000	4819160	And it is not fully autonomous indeed. Yet the consequences that artificial intelligence already
4819160	4826360	do has ethical implications on humans, on us, for example, self-driving cars.
4826920	4831960	So of course, here is a topic more of the copyrights, but it's also important on this
4831960	4839400	more simple example, how ethical ideas actually can be significant also in copyrights,
4839400	4848520	because it may be more intricate, but ethical ideas are very important in artificial intelligence,
4848520	4855000	how it's built, and how it operates. Because as I mentioned, it collects data and uses this data.
4855640	4862120	So how it will be used, because also it's important to think of artificial intelligence,
4862120	4868520	not only as author, it also present in governmental systems, for example, compass,
4868520	4875560	artificial intelligence algorithm that helps in courts to convict or either make certain
4875560	4883240	decision for the court. So it is also not only about authorship, it's also about the court system
4883240	4887560	and how it is embedded in the government, which also I think is important to think.
4887560	4895000	So yes, another thing was mentioned about limiting AI data, how it feeds on it.
4895000	4903080	So of course, model release forms is very popular thing, which means that model may not give consent
4903080	4909160	and their photos were used. This is where popular or so not before artificial intelligence
4909960	4917880	and still is reinforced by artificial intelligence. So one idea that I also had is that maybe we could
4917880	4926280	put certain limits how AI feeds on the data, because in art, it's very big issue in terms of
4926280	4933560	copyrights and ownership when AI copies styles of artists. And these artists lose their income,
4934040	4940200	because people, they can just order from artificial intelligence for much lower price
4940200	4946200	in any way they want, and then they have to pay artists while machine feed on artists style.
4946200	4954120	So I think it's a fraud, but I don't know how to solve it yet. But yes, so maybe there could be limits
4954120	4961400	how it feeds on data. So either say that collaboration with artists, so we use your style,
4961400	4970200	we give you some a fee for this. So you have this system of payment and the contract, which is I
4970200	4975800	find very favorable, but it's also important to understand when AI feeds on someone's style and
4975800	4989080	when not. So hard to find styles. Yes. For example, there's a provision in the copyright law that says
4989080	4996200	you cannot copyright a font. The reason you can't copyright a font is that it's not possible
4997560	5002040	in any reasonable technology to compare one font to another.
5003560	5010680	It is so, but certain also artistic styles, they're so recognizable, like Picasso, for example.
5011240	5018280	Of course, like it may be a little bit more free in terms of Picasso, but there are modern artists
5018280	5026200	who actually experience this because their style is so distinct. Like there was a Brazilian Spanish
5026200	5034040	artist who has such also abstract type of style and artificial intelligence. It became really
5034040	5040280	popular. Many people tried to recreate it. So this is more modern context. So how would copies the
5040280	5048200	styles? Yeah. But I wondered though, the style, if I as a human sound like Bob Dylan. So I
5048200	5053080	sing in the style of Bob Dylan, Bob Dylan can't sue me for copyright infringement because that's
5053640	5060040	how many singers sound like Bob Dylan, right? How many people look like painted like Matisse,
5060040	5065720	right? So the style of somebody is not copyrightable. So similarly, if a machine copies the style of
5065720	5071400	something, is that copyrightable? And I'd argue no, right? Because it is the idea of Matisse,
5071400	5076280	it is the idea of Picasso, it is the idea of Bob Dylan. And again, ideas are not copyrightable,
5076280	5081240	only the expressions of those ideas. So as long as I'm not copying the expression of Bob Dylan,
5081240	5085880	as long as I'm not copying the expression of Matisse, the expression of Picasso,
5085880	5088840	there's no copyright infringement. So can you really copy the idea?
5089480	5094360	You think that Bob Dylan's singing style is not copyrightable?
5094360	5100040	I think it's not. Well, but how many singers sound like Bob Dylan? Lots of them, right?
5100040	5104120	Billy Joel, I mean, if you're a fan of Billy Joel and you're a fan of Bob Dylan and you know,
5104120	5109000	piano man, singing as a song, you're a piano man, and then, hey, Mr. Tambourine, I mean, seriously.
5109000	5113880	And then I've been to a Billy Joel event where you sit and ask questions with the guy and I ask
5113880	5119160	him, so what's the deal with piano man? He's like, I love Bob Dylan, right? So, I mean,
5120200	5125800	but we don't hold artists accountable for these sorts of, what otherwise would be, right? But
5125800	5129800	we're trying to hold AI accountable for these sorts of transgressions. They're not really,
5129800	5135080	they're just the way we do things. I think what happens is human people see that our machine
5135720	5140680	is doing exactly what we did, but in a computational way. And then we feel a lot less
5140680	5145560	special about ourselves. And so our knee-jerk response is to sort of go after, you know, find some
5146760	5152680	element of our uniqueness. But the fact is, it's just not, it's a variance.
5152680	5157560	And I would also say that there's a trademark law, right? So if I were to pass something off as
5157560	5162280	Bob Dylan or pass something off as Billy Joel, that would be trademarks. So there's a bunch of
5162280	5167640	cases where there's, Vanna White said that you have a robot that looks like me, there's Tom
5167640	5172440	Waits said you sound like me. So there's the trademark aspect of it, but the machine is not
5172440	5178760	doing that. If I use chat GPT, say right in the style of Tom Wolf, and then I put it out as something
5178760	5182680	that is Tom Wolf-like, that might be a trademark infringement, but that would not be a copyright
5182680	5191080	infringement. Okay. Well, I think that I think that that's that's interesting because I think
5191080	5200120	there is case law. I can't put my finger on it immediately where the the expression, the style
5200760	5206440	of writing is in fact, what got copyrighted in the story content was nothing.
5206680	5218920	The problem is, at least in my opinion, the copyright law does not really differentiate
5218920	5226200	things properly in a way that you can actually apply it. The same thing is true of patent law
5226200	5236040	in some ways as well. It's very, very difficult to write a patent that is bulletproof and doesn't
5236520	5246440	somehow have prior out out there that will kill it. It's, it's, it's hard. And, you know, we, we
5247240	5261400	chose to maintain patterns of protection, which go back 100 years, 200 years and more. And it's
5261400	5270600	very difficult to have anticipated 200 years ago the conflicts that we have trying to figure out
5270600	5277960	whether chat GPT is, is going to be able to be make output, which is copyright or not.
5279000	5284920	And in terms of what what we're doing today, I don't remember the exact number, but I think
5284920	5294040	about half of Forbes magazine is generated by a computer from from financial data without the
5294040	5304120	interference of any human being. There is, there's a guy that built a system that looked a lot like
5304120	5314040	GPT some years ago, who's a professor at Northwestern and started a little company and
5314120	5320920	immediately got all of the major financial and sports magazines on his, his customer list. And
5320920	5324520	you haven't heard of your doom at all, but he puts out lots of magazines.
5327480	5334200	That goes to you cannot copyright facts as well. So if a machine is merely taking financial data
5334200	5339640	facts, and then just expressing those facts, that is not copyrightable. There's nothing creative
5339640	5345240	or original about expression of facts. But then it had it had a knob in the in the UI
5345240	5350680	that allowed you to choose the financial comment or style was you you wanted to use
5350680	5357000	for each particular article. And so it's, it's, it's kind of, it's going to have some
5357800	5363400	knowledge of what that expression is in some sense, because it makes it something that's
5363480	5370920	recognizable by humans. And I suppose that also recognizable by machine as a result.
5373640	5380680	We're coming up to 530 and I gotta say, I think I really like this. Could you say the last thing
5380680	5386760	here? And then if everybody, if everybody who talked would send me their email address, I'd
5386760	5393000	really appreciate that. Okay, thank you. So yeah, so because it's maybe hard to
5394360	5399240	understand maybe the copyright and ownership concept, this is why I thought the awareness
5399880	5406520	is much easier. And at the same time, it has similar impact to the ownership and the copyright
5408280	5415960	notions, so that we kind of show that in this article, AI participate, because of course,
5415960	5421240	data, why artificial intelligence is so powerful and good, because it can process much more data
5421240	5428040	than a human can. So it can feed on so many different types of information. And we make sense
5428040	5435320	of it, or the AI may pre make sense of it. And then we kind of, at best, it would be very favorable
5435320	5442520	if we control this process, and say, yes, this is correct conclusion, this is maybe not. So this
5442520	5450120	is why the awareness of, for example, in the articles, we can point maybe not even percentage
5450120	5457960	that would be maybe too good, though can also raise questions that, yeah, you did 30% as a human, but
5457960	5466360	this 30% can have a big impact. So yes, back to the awareness. And it may be a good solution,
5466360	5474200	as I see it also, because we don't have to really go deeper into what AI actually
5474840	5482760	is. But at the same time, it has similar impact as the ownership dispute.
5486600	5489320	Okay, does anybody want to say the very, very last word?
5490120	5497720	Anyhow, thank you very much. It was really, I think this is a successful experiment. I was
5499000	5505480	really pleased that we ended up having a nice, nice collection of comments. And I think we
5505480	5511400	actually move the ball forwards. And thank you very much. And for your participation and
5513000	5516600	call it good evening. Thank you. See you next week, maybe.
