1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So this is E380 for May 10th, 2023.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And our speaker is Ken Kahn, who is retired in Oxford after being at Oxford.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And soon we'll be back at Oxford.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Ken was back in the Dark Ages at Xerox Park for a bit.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And there he worked on a project which became a lifetime session, I guess,

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
called Toon Talk, which was the first really configurable, programmable

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
animation system.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And in its day, golly, I hate to think of how long ago it was.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It was really the most amazing thing.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And rather than go the commercial route and build video games,

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
it can keep poking away at the methodology and the underlying structures

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
of which you tell stories through pictures and voice.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He recently did some work collaborating with the chat GPT-4.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And unlike a lot of people who looked at it as using it as a tool,

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
he appears to believe, as I do, that chat GPT-4 is just another programming

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
companion, a worker, a colleague, and used it in a very interesting way.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So I'm going to let you go on from there and feel free, by the way,

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
if you're in the audience, to interrupt with questions and so forth.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And if it gets to be a diversionary thing, we'll either accept it or not.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Go on, Ken.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Good.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let me move this.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The Zoom stuff was sort of in the way.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
All right.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thanks, everybody, for coming and feel free to interrupt,

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
ask questions at any time.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And this is what I'll be talking about is some experiments I've done trying

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
to create apps, just having conversations with a language model.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But first, maybe I'll give you a tiny bit of background.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So I was doing good old-fashioned AI for about 20 years first at the MIT

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Lab and then Sir Ox Park and so on.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And then I got into the idea of creating a programming language for

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
children that was completely based around animation.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There was no text involved.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And then in the middle of that, I also got involved in Oxford,

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
in a big project trying to make it possible for

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
people to make agent-based simulations of, you know,

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
epidemics or ant colonies or whatever.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And then I got involved in 2016 in a big European research project where my

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
role was to make it possible for the students, and these were 11 to 14

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
world to be able to incorporate machine learning in their projects.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So I built upon the SNAP programming language, which is more adult version

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
of Scratch, and added lots of blocks for doing computer vision or

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
natural language processing or to be even able to just create

45
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
neural networks and train them right there in the browser.

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And that was my focus until ChatGPT came along.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And I've been focused on treating ChatGPT as a colleague here.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So I'm going to give a really detailed story about one conversation I had

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
with ChatGPT, which involved building a fireworks application.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And then I'm going to touch on some of these other examples that I've also

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
done with ChatGPT.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And I keep saying ChatGPT, and I started it with the older one,

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
but as soon as I had access to GPT-4, I only used the GPT-4 version of it,

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
which is just so much more capable than any of the other ones.

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And I've done attempts to see if I could do it with Microsoft Bing or

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Google's Barred or Hugging Chat or Claude from Anthropic or Pi,

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
which just came out.

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And all of them did pretty poorly, though I did just read that today

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Google said they're going to be announcing a new version of Barred

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
that's more capable in generating code.

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So maybe it would be an equally good alternative.

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And I didn't really explore very carefully the older version of ChatGPT.

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So the first example I'll give you is where the, I asked ChatGPT to be more

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
like a tutor and I myself pretended to be a student.

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But then the other six examples, it's much more of pair programming where

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
the chatbot is really doing all of the programming.

67
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And I'm kind of the navigator kind of saying, oh, we should try this or

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
that's not working or what about this problem.

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I also have to just because of the current technology do a little bit of

70
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
copy and paste, but that's very mechanical and not very interesting.

71
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So first thing to understand is that these are much more than just code

72
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
generators that they, let me move this.

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
They could, just by their nature will, will not just give you code but give

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
you some explanations of what's going on in the bigger picture and how that works.

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And then if you ask, it'll always put some comments in the code, but if you

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
don't really understand some function, you could just ask it to comment it and

77
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
it'll, every little section, it'll put in comments and not just sort of meaning,

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I mean, redundant comments, but ones that are actually quite helpful.

79
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And the other thing is it's, it often makes, constructs buggy code, but if you

80
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
tell it about the bugs, especially if you just copy and paste the error messages

81
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
into the chat, it could fix them.

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And then if you ask it, and you say, okay, could you think of ways to improve

83
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
this app, it'll come up with a lot of sensible suggestions.

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
And then there's been cases where it couldn't generate some code because it

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
was trained two years ago, and they're, it was using an API that's much newer

86
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
than that. And all I did was copy and paste the documentation into the chat

87
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
GPT and, you know, read it in the chat.

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And it could also generate documentation.

89
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And it's also important, especially when you're thinking about children using

90
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
this that you could set, you could tell it from the beginning, you know,

91
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
you're talking to a young child, and it'll use a different kind of

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
language, you know, language, you know, you can use it as a, you know,

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
a language that's much newer than that. And all I did was copy and paste the

94
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
documentation into the chat GPT and, you know, read it in seconds and was

95
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
able, you know, use a different kind of vocabulary and avoid more technical

96
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
things and so on.

97
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So I, all of these experiments I decided to use, ask it to create a web app

98
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
in JavaScript, you know, with some HTML and CSS. And the reason for that is

99
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
these three reasons is that there's nothing anyone would need to install

100
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
because everybody's got a browser. And browsers are so capable these days,

101
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
you know, they've got speech synthesis, speech recognition, they, you know,

102
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
they could easily communicate with all sorts of APIs and so on.

103
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And, and then it's so much easier for people to share, you could actually

104
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
just send the index.html file on the script.js file to your friends,

105
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
or you could host it any number of places for free, just as static web pages.

106
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You don't have to run a server or anything.

107
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And what professional programmers are using, I recently read a survey that said

108
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
something like about 75% of people that are using large language models to help

109
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
with their programming are using the Visual Studio copilot, but 20 or 25% are

110
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
doing what I'm doing, which is just to have a conversation with the chatbot

111
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
that can program rather than have it nicely integrated. And of course,

112
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
being nicely integrated, you know, you don't have to do the copy and paste

113
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and it maybe understands more of the bigger context. It's, it's, it's, but it's

114
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
much too complicated to imagine a typical school student using it.

115
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Okay, so the example that I want to start with is this fireworks one, which

116
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
as I said before, this one's a little different than the other ones I'm going to

117
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
talk about because I, I, I asked it from the beginning to be more like a tutor

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
than just a colleague.

119
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:32,000
As you'll see, there's myself or my persona was pretending to be this. Yeah,

120
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I needed to know something about JavaScript, but not that much.

121
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And I'll show you the result in a minute, but let's just go through what this

122
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
conversation was all about.

123
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
So, um, I assume everybody could read this, that's France big enough and all

124
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,000
that. The, the, um, I, I started off by just saying you're a tutor for beginner

125
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
programmers, first learning JavaScript, you provide hints and explanations, but

126
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
never provide complete solutions. Instead, you nudge the learner towards

127
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
solutions. And it says, sure, I'll be happy to help. And then I said, can you,

128
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
how can I program a display of fireworks? And it says, oh, well, using a canvas

129
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
is probably the best way to go. And then it actually comes up with this, whatever

130
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
it is, eight point plan for how to actually build this, including, you know,

131
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
making different classes and having an animate and so on.

132
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So this is one of the few places where this very nice tool called share GPT.com

133
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
fell down, which is, it makes for a really nice way of sharing your, um,

134
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
uh, your conversation with, with GPT, you just push a button and it creates a

135
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
URL that has the entire thing. But for some reason this, because I copy and

136
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
pasted here, this tiny little index HTML file ahead. But what it was, I'll tell

137
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
you right now is simply, it said here to create a, create a canvas.

138
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So it was just basically the rear bones of a HTML file with a canvas and nothing

139
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
really else. And, you know, it's, it responds always in this real nice,

140
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
encouraging, friendly way that a good tutor maybe should be, you know, well,

141
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
that was a good starting point of our recommending a few more things you could

142
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
add these more features. And then it generates this, and you could just

143
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
simply in the live version of this, I just click on copy code and then it's on

144
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
the clipboard. And then I just create a folder called fireworks and I create a

145
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
file called index dot HTML and just paste this into it. You know, so I don't

146
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
really need to be very technically competent to, to have this kind of

147
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
experience. So then, remember it said also here, that I should use this get

148
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
element by ID and get context. So I'm assuming I knew a little bit here. So I

149
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
said, you know, oh, I, I just started, I did these two lines of code. And it's,

150
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
you know, great start and all that. So then it suggests that I size the canvas

151
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and have it adjust whenever the browser windows is resized so that you always

152
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
have a canvas that's the right size. So I just again, you know, copy code and

153
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
just pasted it in. But it said the next thing it said here was to create a

154
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
class for fireworks. So I pretended not to know how to do that. So I said, how do

155
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I define a class? And it gives a nice explanation and gives a nice little generic

156
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
example of a class and how you can make an instance. And then I actually made this

157
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
mistake. I meant to say how's this and paste in my little bit of code. But it

158
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
noticed that I forgot to include whether the code that it wanted me to review. So

159
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
here. So then I just pasted it in. So this is, you know, my attempt to be a

160
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
beginning student who kind of figured out from what it was saying that this is

161
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
what, what I should do. And again, you know, it's encouraging. It's on the right

162
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
track. But here's a few suggestions, you know, the convention is this should be

163
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,000
kept. Start with a capital letter. You know, I should have a update method and

164
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:51,000
maybe on a gravity be good. So, so it suggests this update and then I should

165
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:04,000
define these two methods. And then I was thinking that I, you know, if I'm assuming

166
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
that a student at least understands a little bit about velocity and gravity is not

167
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
the same, I'm sure they could have asked chat GPT here, but, but I didn't know

168
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
whether it would matter if I update the vertical position and then update the

169
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
velocity or update the velocity and then the vertical position. And it says

170
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
differently minimal, but most people do it this way. And it's a little bit better

171
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,000
to do it in this order. And then it gives me the code for it.

172
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:44,000
At that point, I pretend not to know how to, how to actually draw the fireworks

173
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
rocket. And, you know, it says, Oh, well, you know, we could do it. The simplest

174
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
thing would be to make it be a circle. And here's the code and notice it generated

175
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
all these comments and so on. And then it gives a nice explanation of how this works

176
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
and what it's doing. So now I have the bare minimum of this program, but I guess

177
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm pretending that I have no idea how to even test this. So it says, Oh, well,

178
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
you could create a sample fireworks with these parameters and then create an

179
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
animation loop that just continually calls update and draw. And again, it

180
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
explains what's going on and how to get this to work. And then it says, you know,

181
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
this code should be in the file called fireworks.js. And then just click on the

182
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
index.html file in the browser. And you'll see it working. And then it doesn't

183
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
working. So I was smart enough to say, Well, how could I see if there's an error

184
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
message? And then it tells me about different ways I could get to the console

185
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
and see what an error message is. And then I copy and pasted the error message in

186
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,000
here. And it realized that the problem was that the JavaScript was running before

187
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
the page had fully loaded. And it gives two ways of solving this. You use the

188
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Windows on load, or you could simply move the script later in the HTML. And I did

189
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:32,000
the letter. So at that point, I saw the rocket go up. But it wasn't exploding yet,

190
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
of course. So I didn't have a good idea how to do the explosion. And it comes up

191
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:45,000
with this plan for how to do it and a basic outline of how to implement it. You

192
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,000
know, where it makes 50 particles and they all go off in random directions and

193
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:07,000
with some random speeds. And so then I thought, well, it wasn't clear if I should

194
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
just, because the fireworks rocket and the particles had very similar ways of

195
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
being drawn and being updated, whether I should really just copy the same code

196
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and it says, oh, well, you know, you could create a base class and then have a

197
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
called moving object and then fireworks and particles could be subclasses that

198
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
extend it. And again, it's just giving you the sketch of how to do it. It doesn't

199
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:44,000
matter if it's filling everything for you right now. So, so I kind of follow this

200
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,000
advice, but I didn't understand again, how I could test it, because remember the

201
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
test before was just whether you could get a rocket to go up and how do I test the

202
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:05,000
thing. And it comes up with, again, a nice little plan for doing it. And then it

203
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:13,000
gives the sort of sketch of the code and leaves some things for me to do. And

204
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:23,000
again, it explains what to do. So it was giving me explanations and I said, how

205
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:35,000
about this for creating a test fireworks. And it said it looks good. And it'll create

206
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
one, you know, explains what it'll do. It'll be at the bottom and somewhere, but

207
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
it'll be red and initial velocity and with gravity or something. And then it's trying

208
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
to be kind of, again, I think it's pretty good that it doesn't just make me feel like

209
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm, you know, ignorant and it's so knowledgeable. It says, well, here's a small

210
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
suggestion, you know, be nice to make the colors random rather than just all of them

211
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
being red and provides a very simple little function for coming up with a random

212
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
color and then shows how I could use it. So I tried all that. And now remember, it

213
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
doesn't have any idea with what's going on. I have to always tell it how things are

214
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
going. And I said, I think the fireworks would only go about a third of the way up

215
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
of the screen and blow up and they weren't using the full canvas. And it gives a nice

216
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
explanation that depending on the initial velocity and the gravity value, they may not

217
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:49,000
be in balance. So it suggests that I increased the velocity and decreased gravity. And I

218
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
tried it and now they flew off the top of the canvas. But because it kind of explained

219
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
what was going on, I just only increased the velocity and left gravity alone and it was

220
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:15,000
working just fine. And it approved my changes to its suggestions. And, you know, it's

221
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
saying there's no correct value, you could play with different ones, you could explore

222
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
until you get something you're happy with or something. So then I ask, well, how can I add

223
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
effects to this? And it explains that there's the audio API built into the browser and it

224
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
can read file, I mean, play files with these extensions. And it creates a tiny little function

225
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,000
for doing it. And it suggests that, you know, you put play sound of the launch when the

226
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:57,000
fireworks are created and then you play the explosion when it explodes. And then I ask

227
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
it, how would you suggest I search for the two sounds that we need? And it says, certainly

228
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
there's a lot of websites with four year paid ones. And it says this one is a collaborative

229
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
one with Creative Commons license sound. And then it even suggests, maybe I was up here,

230
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:21,000
yeah, the keywords I searched for fireworks launch or rocket launch or fireworks explosion.

231
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So I put them in just as it suggested. And then I thought, it'd be nice to have a button

232
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,000
that when you push starts everything up rather than it just happens. So it says, well, you

233
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:48,000
could just add this button to your HTML. And then, and then in your JavaScript, get hold

234
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
of that button and put a listener that and it had this idea that you don't start the fireworks

235
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
until some global variable is set. And I could have just copied that but I said, you know,

236
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I understood that if all I want to do is when the buttons pushed that it starts animating

237
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
why not just start animating. So I said, can't I just do that. And it says, oh, you're right

238
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
that more direct and, you know, straightforward. And, you know, said don't don't add this start

239
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,000
fireworks flag but instead, you know, is this kind of code or change the code, you know,

240
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:41,000
with this aspect. And then I noticed that the the request animation frame used to be that

241
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
the first thing it did and that was the last thing and I just got curious and said, does

242
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
it matter whether it's in the beginning of the end and it says it can have an impact but

243
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
the difference is usually subtle and explains how there's a risk that if you do it in the

244
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:07,000
beginning you might be you might lead to some performance issues and so on.

245
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:15,000
So everything was working and then in one of some of the suggested code there was a comment

246
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:24,000
saying that you should I should implement something that would remove the particles.

247
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,000
And I just said, you know, you said I should remove the particles but I didn't do it and

248
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:38,000
everything's working fine anyways. And it explains that you know, basically, you're, I might end up

249
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
consuming a lot more memory and processing on particles that are no longer visible or

250
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:54,000
that can lead to making everything go slow or use a lot of memory. And it suggests a life span, but I said

251
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I'd rather have it just remove when they're no longer visible when it said sure that's reasonable and

252
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:10,000
generated the condition here for when particles off the outside, not visible anymore.

253
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So everything was working but there was an annoying little scroll bars and horizontally and vertical.

254
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And so I said I see these scroll bars and it said well maybe it's because the canvas and the page on the right

255
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
size and it suggested all this but actually that that's very close to what it had before.

256
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And I said it didn't help. And then it came up with some more CSS to kind of deal with it.

257
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And I said, yeah, a little bit better but because the scroll bars were less of an issue but there still were

258
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:57,000
there I mean there was very little scrolling involved. So then it said well maybe we just have to remove a few pixels from

259
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:09,000
the window dimensions of the canvas. And it suggested removing, you know, four pixels, and I tried it and it didn't work but

260
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:18,000
when I did 10 it was fine. So everything was fine. And then I said well, you know, fireworks should happen at night it should be a

261
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
black background so it just generated, you know these two lines of code here rather than clearing it.

262
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And then I said, I can't think of any other improvements can you, and it came up with what is this nine different improvements, you know, a couple of them actually were already done

263
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:41,000
and it didn't seem to remember that it already randomized the colors and had a variable radius but

264
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:51,000
but it could have you know we could add wind or air resistance we could have more different shapes we could have a trail, you know, more user activity, you know.

265
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
So I thought well I'll just pick one of this number five.

266
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
So it suggested adding, you know, an alpha value and

267
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
and then the update uses it.

268
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:15,000
But notice that there's this thing called global alpha and I would have thought somehow alpha itself was all.

269
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:24,000
This I never heard of global alpha what is it and gives me nice explanation and how it works and why he's using it and so on.

270
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
So then

271
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,000
what when I tried doing the change that it suggested.

272
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I got this error message that that you must call the super constructor in a derived class because since I was altering the some class without calling the super.

273
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
And it said oh you just have to add this line.

274
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And so that fix that problem.

275
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:07,000
And I said, you know, it'd be nice if the app actually had a little note saying this was created with the help of GPT for

276
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
and having a link to the log.

277
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And it created all this nice CSS and it created this div with the description and the link and so on.

278
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And then it generated all this code but it actually forgot to add the

279
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:39,000
include the JavaScript script that the script element had been there and it just forgot it when I was putting this in so I just said you.

280
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:47,000
But again this is just, this wasn't a problem originally this is a problem with the shared GPT that sometimes when I paste things.

281
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
So they don't somehow make it into this history.

282
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
So then I said that you forgot this but I added it.

283
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:07,000
And then we want to remove the button after it's clicked and everything's working up if this is a problem that happens on many of the occasions which is

284
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
it used the word and knit here.

285
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Well, earlier it was using the name of the function was animate.

286
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I told it, you know, I fixed it but you know.

287
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But I think because these conversations get long in the context is limited to, I don't know, I think it's up to 8,000 tokens for track GPT for and there's a 32 K version that access to but.

288
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:50,000
And as a result it's kind of forgetting some of the earlier stuff that it told me and it was just guessing. And this is a common problem. I'll show you where it forgets exactly what a variable name or function name isn't in there.

289
00:29:50,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Generates code with a similar name with the same kind of concept but obviously one that won't work because computer programming languages need the exact same name.

290
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'll show you the results of all of this.

291
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So if I click here.

292
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Happy.

293
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Yeah.

294
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:49,000
And that took, I don't know, less than two hours I probably should have kept track of the timing, the whole experience but I thought, you know, it was a very promising kind of

295
00:30:49,000 --> 00:31:01,000
experience in terms of how helpful it was how much it was suggesting things how good the suggestions were, how much and understood about things and how much a good explain things.

296
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
So, that's what I want to say about fireworks.

297
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But one thing that everybody's been talking about with these chatbots is how important it is to do prompt engineering and there are many contexts in which it really is important, but I've been surprised for almost all my experiments.

298
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I very, very rarely did any attempt to make good prompts, you know, I would copy and paste an error instead of saying, Well, this is the error I found in the console or so.

299
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:50,000
It was the only one where I wanted it to be more of a tutor so I had this, this, sorry, prompt here but that was pretty much the only exception where I wasn't just having an ordinary conversation with it.

300
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I didn't bother to make it use speech instead of typing these things but that's straightforward to do especially because, you know, browsers have speech recognition API.

301
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Okay, so let me tell you a little bit about these six other experiments I did.

302
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Okay, so, right.

303
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So here, I wasn't playing the house key into play the role of a tutor I was treating it very much like pair programming.

304
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And I'm more than navigator suggesting things and chat GPT is the, the one actually generating the code or something.

305
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:56,000
So I said how can I create a web page with a button that when clicked speaks a random integer, less than 1000 in a random language pitch rate and voice.

306
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So it, you know, told me here's some HTML. Here's the JavaScript.

307
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It had just three languages but said you can add more. And it understood all about the speech synthesis API that the, you know, HTML five, all the browsers have.

308
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And it's picking a random pitch or random rate and learning the language and reporting errors and stuff.

309
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:42,000
So, so just with what the first pass like this, when I clicked on the button.

310
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I saw that there was this error or not no voices available but then if I clicked again, everything worked fine from then on.

311
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It understood exactly what was going on which is that the get voices is asynchronous and they may not have been loaded when the first time you clicked on the button but then the second time it has is loaded.

312
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:14,000
So you could program around this by

313
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:28,000
on voices changed so that you, you don't try to say anything until this flag has been set that the voices have been loaded.

314
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:39,000
So that worked. And then I said, Oh, it'll be nice to display what the number is and the language and I said etc and then understood perfectly well that meant the pitch and the rate and so on.

315
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And also, I didn't really like the idea of having to go to the console to see an error message so could you report it some other way.

316
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:57,000
And, you know, it updated the HTML updated the JavaScript.

317
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And then it was pretty ugly so I just simply said add CSS I didn't, you know, say more than that, and it generated some reasonable CSS to make it all look nicer and explaining what it was and stuff.

318
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And then, rather than have just those three languages baked into it. I said why don't you add all the languages that are available in Chrome.

319
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And I said in Chrome but it actually comes up and it says Chrome here too but it actually comes up with a solution that'll work for any browser, because it's just collecting all the languages that the browser has available, and then pulling out the language code.

320
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
The languages, the voices.

321
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So,

322
00:35:50,000 --> 00:36:02,000
so that worked. And I had a working version of this but then I thought it'd be nice to have an additional capability in this app.

323
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So I said, add a cartoon image of a parrot and when you click on it repeats what the user says with a random language pitch rate and place.

324
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So it, you know, it has this parrot that thing and it says you know I should put replace that with my path to whatever I put a parrot image, and then it knew perfectly well how to use the speech recognition.

325
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,000
API to pick up what somebody was saying.

326
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And that worked and I said well, give the user feedback as to what text it was actually had heard, along with the other things that were there.

327
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And

328
00:36:48,000 --> 00:37:02,000
and then I said, you know we had a button for speaking random number but I said, use this file again and you can see this is basically, I went to Dolly and said, you know, a colorful collection of random integers.

329
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And it generated that image and I just asked it to incorporated in the app.

330
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And then it didn't look so nice they were vertical and they were kind of small so I said make them larger and lay them out horizontally.

331
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
And it had no problems doing that.

332
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,000
And then I just thought, you know, how would you explain what this app does to a young child.

333
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It says, the app head has two pictures one of colorful numbers another parrot when you click on the picture of colorful numbers the apple.

334
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Make your computer or phone say a random number, it's like picking a number out of a hat but the computer does it for you so it's really trying to you know explain this at a

335
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,000
to a young child pretty well I think you know it's even more fun is the number will be spoken in different language voice speed each time.

336
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:08,000
So if you click on the parrot picture, the app listens to what you say just like a parrot listening to talk, and then the parrot, actually the computer pretending to be the pair will repeat which is really nice, I thought explanation.

337
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And then I said, well, can it translate what was heard.

338
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So you could use Google translate and you need an API key and here's the way to talk to that API and you should, you know, put the key here and goes on and on.

339
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And I asked, you know, so the API key shouldn't be picked in and should ask for it.

340
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I have a, I thought it might be better to use hugging face instead of Google translate so I said, how about using hugging face instead and it was perfectly fine to use hugging face.

341
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,000
But then when I tried it as kept getting these error messages.

342
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And what was really happening was that when you ask hugging face to use a particular model.

343
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:22,000
If it wasn't already loaded, it'll load it and give you back a response saying it's loading please wait an estimated, you know, 10 seconds or something.

344
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But the code wasn't paying attention to that and also I didn't really want it to wait. So, even though it, it explained what was going on and how to fix it. I just went and got a Google translate key.

345
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:45,000
And so let me show you the result.

346
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:56,000
So I'm not going to bother with the translate because I have to get my key and paste it and all that, but it works perfectly fine without it. So if I click here.

347
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,000
So it picked Italian a very high pitch and low rate 408.

348
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And then if I do this, it should be listening.

349
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
It should be.

350
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Oh, yeah.

351
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It should be listening to me as I speak.

352
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And again, if I if we had the API key would have translated that to French inside it.

353
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And again, I had this link to the dialogues you could actually see how this was created.

354
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I have to mention that this parrot, my two year old granddaughter just giggled and giggled and giggled when we'd say things to it and it would repeat it. And it would repeat it in a funny voice or something.

355
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
And would repeat it in a funny voice or something.

356
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Anyway, she thought that was just so fun. Okay.

357
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So let me talk about the next one.

358
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I said, how can I make a web page that detects which way I'm pointing my finger and uses it to draw on a canvas. So my original concept was that if I pointed this way would draw that way if I pointed this way draw that way and so on.

359
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:21,000
But it misunderstood me but actually came up with an equally good scheme that I wasn't didn't bother pursuing.

360
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
So what's so interesting about this is just from this.

361
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
You know, does generates all this HTML CSS but the JavaScript.

362
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Actually, I think it says it here too that it. Yeah, it's actually going to use a machine learning model that's a hand pose that'll figure out, you know, 33 different locations on your finger, you know, the each joint and so on.

363
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And knows how to load it and use it and so on and also of course how to get the video feed going into it.

364
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:12,000
And then here how to load the TensorFlow.js library and then how to load the hand pose model, and how to use it and then how to use it to detect if I'm my fingers pointing upward.

365
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And this is why an interesting thing that sometimes it's generating code and just stops in the middle, or the case the explanation.

366
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And that's because, you know, it only does so much of a completion it's limited to 1000 or 2000 tokens or something but if you just say please continue it just apologizes and just starts right where pretty much where left off and, you know, continues generating code.

367
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And then I said, well, nothing's being drawn and it says oh there's some issue about the position on the canvas, and it turns out it was a bit confused about the to the coordinate system of the

368
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:12,000
hand pose and the coordinate system of the canvas, but it tried to fix it and then I said well now it's only drawing in small area and it finally, you know, gets it right with some changes.

369
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:21,000
And then this is this problem where it uses some variable called predictions but

370
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,000
but it was, in this case I think it was a scoping error but sometimes it's because it had a different name and some other part of the code.

371
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So it suggests how to pass the make it available here.

372
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And then I said, well, how about if you say the color it'll change to the color that the user spoke and it

373
00:43:44,000 --> 00:44:03,000
will again use a speech recognition and only accepts, you know, these 10 different colors and if you say any of it, if what you said includes any of the these 10 colors then it'll switch to that color.

374
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And there's a default color of black and so on.

375
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:19,000
And it turned out, it worked the first time but only the first time and it said, oops, sorry for the confusion I should be using the API bill differently and it regenerates the code.

376
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:27,000
And everything's working and I said well let's display what what the last thing spoken in the current color so that people know that it's here hanging it.

377
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:42,000
And then this is very nice I just said add instructions on how to use the app, and it generates, you know, the, the HTML to explain how to use it, and make some CSS to make that look nice.

378
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And then somehow the display didn't get right.

379
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Again, because I think it was forgetting what it was calling things before it was using different similar but different names here.

380
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And again the same problem that it could picked up the wrong variable name or something.

381
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:12,000
So it's not the problem might have been that we were doing things before the page was loaded but that wasn't really the problem.

382
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So I said that that didn't fix it and then I said just I didn't have the same much more same problem.

383
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:32,000
And that didn't help. So I had an idea what was wrong but I wasn't right either and it said, it thought maybe that was the issue.

384
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:42,000
So, and also notice this problem like you know, whether it was calling it video or webcam it wasn't consistently naming things.

385
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So it was finally got it all working.

386
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And I didn't understand what happened so somehow it started to work even though these changes didn't seem, I don't know.

387
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:14,000
And then there was a really minor problem that took forever to fix which was, it was showing the last thing that it heard, and then the color, all in the same line and would look nicer if they're on separate lines and it just keeps not getting it right and finally,

388
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:37,000
I said, maybe it's something to do with the overlay. And then it comes up with this solution that I didn't even know about there was some fancy CSS to deal with the problem.

389
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So everything's working fine and then I said, you know, could you explain to a 10 year old how it work and once again it does a really nice job of explaining how this thing works.

390
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And let me show you how what it's like.

391
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Oh, but I have to turn off the video.

392
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Turn it off the video right.

393
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I'll be trying to load it again.

394
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:30,000
So, notice that it generated these instructions all by itself and say I turned off the video. Oh here comes good. So now, if I move my finger like this and I say red, red, blue, blue, blue.

395
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
It's kind of, you know, it's working.

396
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
But I'm able to draw all over it with my finger.

397
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
A five year old or a 10 year old who really like.

398
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Yeah, no, actually, my granddaughter, this was funny too that I can draw on it. Okay, so, but there was what I thought was interesting was, you know, had no troubles.

399
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Loading a machine learning model using it appropriately to get the hand poses just knew how to do all those sort of things.

400
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:15,000
So the next example I wanted to talk about is if some, some person wanted to actually do a little bit of machine learning on some of their own data.

401
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:31,000
So, I had this spreadsheet which was had just 60 examples 20 examples of some text that shows a lot of confidence 20 examples that shows a real lack of confidence and 20 that were kind of neutral.

402
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And I said how can I make a web page that would predict the level of confidence of some new text.

403
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You know, and give some suggestions and, and but oh, but, but I didn't say anything about JavaScript so it thought oh I should just do this all in Python.

404
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:57,000
And then I said no no I don't want to do it in Python how could I do in JavaScript and then it says well here's how you could do it using node and I just wanted a web page.

405
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,000
So I say, no I don't want to use node I only want the browser and so well here's how we could do it.

406
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Um,

407
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:17,000
you know it's loading TensorFlow.js it creates the model, the very small model and compiles it and does the training and

408
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:29,000
and then does a prediction and shows the shows what's going on. And again it stopped right in the middle of the generating I just said continue and it continued generating.

409
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
So I should have these two files.

410
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:41,000
And then I have to put the CSV file somewhere in that same folder or something.

411
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:48,000
So it actually worked but yeah there was no feedback that it while it was training so I said can you make a graph of the training loss.

412
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And so it loads some library and it knows perfectly well how to integrate this library.

413
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:13,000
With the callback of the training and it worked but the plot was much bigger than the page and it looked pretty ugly so I said it was too big and CSS I made it nice makes it look nicer.

414
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And I said, you know why don't why don't you show the likelihood scores for the predictions and it doesn't do that and it does.

415
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And then I asked how can I make this more accurate because it wasn't very accurate.

416
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:35,000
And it says well you could have more data you could do some pre processing rotation you could change the model architecture, you could, you know all these things.

417
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:48,000
And I said well how about you improve the model architecture and it says sure and it makes a bigger model with more layers and

418
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:58,000
and then I said well maybe the user wants to explore how many epochs that give a interface so the user could enter how many epochs they want.

419
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And the graph came up after it was finished training so I said could you make the graph, the updated while it's doing the training, and it's a chair and I heard that.

420
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And then you know, finish.

421
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:17,000
And then I said, could the training function was pretty complicated so I said could you have comments to it.

422
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And notice, you know for each section it says okay you know getting the inputs, preparing the data creating the model.

423
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Setting up the graph, you know, setting up the call back and it just goes on and on explaining it nicely.

424
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:46,000
And then I happened to notice that it was gave very different answers depending on whether I had uppercase or not, and it understood exactly what was going on that it was using the universal sentence encoder.

425
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,000
It was very sensitive, and it can.

426
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:05,000
It can easily fix this by, of course, just taking one of the user input and sending it to lower case so there wasn't that difference. And there it was so let's see it in action.

427
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
So, I'm going to say, I don't know.

428
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
That's just because it.

429
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:17,000
So, it says training, but it's actually

430
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:33,000
coming up with the embeddings for the 60 sentences and there is that now we get the training and see the validation losses going up and so it's overfitting or something, but I could type something here like

431
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:43,000
I say, predict.

432
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:49,000
And it says 99.7% sure that it's confident.

433
00:52:49,000 --> 00:53:02,000
And I say,

434
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:15,000
And then

435
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Well, didn't do so good.

436
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Should have been neutral, but thought that was maybe it's showing some confidence.

437
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Anyways, so that I thought was pretty impressive that it could do something like that.

438
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
So, let's see.

439
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So, in terms of timing.

440
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I don't want to show all of these because it'll take too long but I wanted to.

441
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I think I'll show two more but I'll try to go quickly is that.

442
00:53:46,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Okay, so this one is using asking chat GPT to use GPT to make a conversation between personas.

443
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
personas.

444
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
And

445
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
you know who knows how to.

446
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Well actually didn't know how to call the

447
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
API.

448
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Oh, so various points I had to copy and paste the documentation from their website and then was able to do it fine.

449
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And again, it was trying to use no and I said no, no, I don't want to. And this is interesting that this is why we're using the API key in the front end that's a little bit not recommended because the key could get.

450
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Somebody might be able to get your key or whatever.

451
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Let me maybe this one.

452
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:56,000
I could just, oh, I do want to show you one bug that was so funny.

453
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yeah, here it is.

454
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:18,000
So there's trying to be a conversation between Aristotle and Galileo, but what, but at this point in the progress at Aristotle says I am Galileo and Galileo says I am Aristotle I am not Galileo and then Aristotle says I am Galileo I am Galileo I'm both there so it just was totally crazy.

455
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:31,000
It understood what was wrong here and how to, you know, change the roles and the right messages to the chat system, such that.

456
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Let me show you.

457
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Well actually just an interest of time I'll just show you a screenshot.

458
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
So,

459
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,000
you could enter any two people here.

460
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,000
And then you could join in by just typing a message here and saying send.

461
00:55:51,000 --> 00:56:08,000
So, Galileo greets Aristotle, and they're both really polite to each other, and they appreciate each kind words and blah, and then I jump in and say well how fast objects fall and Aristotle says to Galileo, you know,

462
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:18,000
the challenge seems to know things that happened every died but you know that his motion is a motion of a challenge but he still maintains the speeds proportional to the weight.

463
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And Galileo says, you know,

464
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Oh, and then if there's some weird bug words, it actually repeats this twice and I mentioned it to chat GPT but I made the mistake of mentioning that and another problem and it dealt with the other problem and I never came back to figuring out why.

465
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Sometimes it repeats.

466
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Anyways,

467
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Aristotle's respectfully disagreeing and explaining this and so it's a nice little, you know,

468
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:55,000
app.

469
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:02,000
And so, let me show you the most complicated one.

470
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
I'll tell you real quick. Well, I'll just show you this one.

471
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
This one.

472
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Flowers are all fading away and shrinking, but I could drop water balloons on them and they get bigger or something.

473
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:27,000
So that's.

474
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:33,000
So, you know, it's hard to keep watering all these flowers, you know, so that's that.

475
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:49,000
That's what it, you know, we did with a little conversation. But this was a funny one because it actually was partially working and then in trying to add another feature it broke some of the earlier stuff and then it just wasn't it.

476
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:55,000
This was about the only time when I've really had some not very good results.

477
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:04,000
But when I started over again, it actually did well and also I have links here for how you know bar did trying this or something.

478
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Okay, so this is the, the really big ambitious one that I did.

479
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:19,000
And it's a counter to the thing 111 exchanges back and forth.

480
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:28,000
In the beginning, what I asking you to do is to create,

481
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:35,000
generate a story, and I picked this because

482
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:45,000
you know, Gaiman in Sandman, there's this story where this character has kidnapped amused and for punishment.

483
00:58:46,000 --> 00:59:03,000
It's getting so many ideas for stories that it's that he's going crazy can't think of anything other than stories and there's like a lot of crazy stories including a man who falls in love with paper dolls so I actually did all 15 that came from that story, plus some

484
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,000
other ones that I invented.

485
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:18,000
So it generates, you know, three paragraphs like, like I asked, and then I said, can you criticize them and it says oh well we could do this character development or better setting.

486
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,000
And it's not generic ones it's saying the town the theater was only briefly mentioned maybe you could improve that or something.

487
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:34,000
So it's able to apply suggestions one and four and it does that and then I say well to Chris, you know, come up with criticism for the second paragraph.

488
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:40,000
So it's able to criticize its own generation, its own creations and then apply changes.

489
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
So then I said put it all together into a single story, and then I said,

490
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:58,000
the version of an illustration for each paragraph include the medium the artistic style mood point of view lighting and the like, and it comes up with these kinds of.

491
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
So then, at that point I said well I'd like to make a webpage in which you could do this interactively.

492
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:15,000
And then we get it works, but then eventually works, I should say, and this is a place where it didn't know how to use the.

493
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:37,000
It's the Dolly API, but I just pasted the documentation and you know it's really just copy and paste it with all the, you know, crazy stuff that happens when you just copy and paste it still understood it well enough to generate the right code.

494
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:57,000
And so then I, it goes on and on very long this one I, I, once I got it working for that I said well let's make it work for any story and let's make it so that you could criticize the illustrations and generate new ones and so on.

495
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Maybe I'll show you the final result here.

496
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Well, by the way, I even if you want to get it.

497
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:23,000
An idea of how I did this without going through the entire 111 things I kind of highlighted the main things of what I did and what happened and what was going on here.

498
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And the, here it is.

499
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
So we, by the way, it generated all of the instructions here.

500
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:47,000
So it tells you again this is, I just said add in and instructions in the beginning with a button to close them and it explains how this whole thing works.

501
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:57,000
So then, you know, needs my key there and then I say,

502
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:07,000
can.

503
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I didn't try this before three, three is probably good.

504
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:31,000
So one thing you could do here was I added this button that could actually show you the communications with GPT for and with Dolly so you could see what actually it's, you know, it does.

505
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:38,000
So this shouldn't take more than another less than a minute I think.

506
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:58,000
So this is going to have all of those features that I kind of experimented with in the dialogue so you could ask for, ask it to generate criticism you could decide to apply the criticism to rewrite a paragraph, and you could also get criticism about the illustrations.

507
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:14,000
And you could even enter your own criticism of an illustration and it'll regenerate that will update the illustration prompt and then generate a new story and it should

508
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:21,000
interleave the text and the images.

509
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,000
So,

510
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:48,000
one of the problems with using GPT for is that it's so much slower than 3.5 3.5 would have, you know, done this long ago but for just just as such a nicer job that I tend not to use it obviously I could have asked GPT for to make an interface where you could decide which,

511
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
what role do you want to use for doing this.

512
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Maybe what I should do. Oh, here comes finally.

513
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So, I stood nervously at the podium with the prestigious Stanford University and elite seminar series in electrical engineering, he had spent countless hours perfecting his presentation and sustainable energy systems and was the culmination of his hard work as he looked

514
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:22,000
at the learning of intelligent faces eager to hear what he had to say, he felt a sense of pride also mounting pressure to deliver amounts and shoes, and here I am giving the speech.

515
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
And if I,

516
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:35,000
throw over it we could see that it says the illustrations of watercolor painting with realistic and softly blended colors depicting the anxious Ken standing at the podium the setting as well.

517
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Lit hall with the iconic Stanford University seal.

518
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
That's true.

519
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:55,000
It's getting enhancing it intensity the point of view is from the audience looking. So it's a bit confused because the audience is there and it's looking at the audience but this is a dolly problem it's it's actually generated.

520
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
So if I click on this. Here's the, the description.

521
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
And

522
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Oh, that's interesting.

523
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Well, maybe it's still thinking, because I think it's going to, it's going to show some suggested changes to the

524
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,000
to the thing.

525
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I don't know.

526
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:33,000
So maybe I'll just say,

527
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I don't like changes. So rewrite the description.

528
01:05:48,000 --> 01:06:01,000
And then once it's the descriptions were written I could hit. So now it should say an oil painting was realistic when I say replace the image and generate a new one or something.

529
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And even while this is happening I could, I think I could click. Oh, here it comes. I'll close this.

530
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And there I am giving a lecture.

531
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
It looks just like you.

532
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Yeah.

533
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:26,000
And then if I click here, I'll get some criticism that it'll generate for the first paragraph here.

534
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:34,000
By the way, we can see what the other paragraphs look like well the audience got excited here.

535
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
This is the pro AI group.

536
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
And then.

537
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Wow.

538
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Looks like everybody wanted my autograph at the end.

539
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:55,000
It's pretty good.

540
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:04,000
As he concluded the talk and any questions it was clear that he made an impact professors and students like approached him praising. This is pretty good.

541
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Anyways, if we go here.

542
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:12,000
So it generates seven suggestions for how to change this paragraph.

543
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
The opening sentence.

544
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Introduce more background on Ken so that the readers understand my qualifications and reasons for giving the talk.

545
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Whatever.

546
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
And I could even say here you know change it from energy systems to chat.

547
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:35,000
So that's the, the most ambitious.

548
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
That I created with chat.

549
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
So I'm practically finished here.

550
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:51,000
So one question in my mind is doing this does it automate away the fun of programming.

551
01:07:51,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Or is it better to think of this as empowering people with very little programming skills to create all sorts of be very creative and creating apps.

552
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:16,000
And see more pampered often wrote about hard fun because one of the children talked about how programming and logo was was hard fun that it was, or he probably said it was fun but hard.

553
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
So,

554
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:32,000
that's still the case but it's also for a lot of children they find it frustrating or too difficult and, you know, just doesn't always work to introduce programming to children.

555
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And also there's sometimes the teachers don't are much support because they don't understand very well how to program either.

556
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:56,000
So the, the plus side is that by having a collaboration like this anybody with just an idea for an app that's reasonable obviously, if you wanted to make, you know, a triple A rated game or something, you're not likely to succeed.

557
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
But it could come to life through this kind of process.

558
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Of course, GPT for is GPT for there will be a five and a six and a seven and eight. Yeah, exactly. That's exactly what I'm talking about the future here so the short term we could expect it just to get, you know, more competent and the GPT for can

559
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:36,000
look at images and understand them, but that's only been released to a to a very small number of testers and some company that's producing software for blind people.

560
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:54,000
But that's coming so you could you should be able to just like take a screenshot of of a problem with your app and then say well here's here's what what's going on and it'll interpret the image and maybe figure out how to fix things.

561
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:16,000
And this copy and paste thing is, you know, obviously can be automated. And, you know, the, probably as many of you know about the, the leaked Google Docs that claims that the open source alternatives to barred and GPT for are getting so good that maybe

562
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:24,000
the big players don't really have any particular edge over what's going on in the open source rule.

563
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:38,000
So maybe that will be something that near term could be done but the long term who knows it's really going to keep getting better and more capable and so on.

564
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:54,000
And so I, I asked Dolly to create a water color painting for the question and answer portion of the talk. And I said no text should be included in it.

565
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:04,000
So, hopefully there are some questions.

566
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,000
How do you like working with an AI as a, as a colleague.

567
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:34,000
The, the first thing, the fireworks thing was the most pleasant one because it was, it was trying to be, you know, had this role more of a tutor, the, the other ones that was still, you know, really interesting but I felt like it was kind of writing this program and asking

568
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:53,000
for a lot of copy and pasting, you know, and to report about errors, you know, that that was sort of my role. I mean, of course, that's not quite fair because what I also did was, and this is maybe an important aspect of this is that I always started with the simplest version of the app that I had in mind.

569
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:16,000
And once I got that, I would ask for a single enhancement and once that works another one so I was, I was, I did have a, an incremental plan for how the app should get build that was purely mine and it was, you know, my assistant in that role but, but often it was more like, you know,

570
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:24,000
just telling me okay here's some code replace this here's some code, you know, copy and paste this and.

571
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:42,000
But it was still something exciting about the fact that you know it understood me so well and I was, and I was able to do so many things and knew all these different APIs and was better at CSS than I am for sure.

572
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:50,000
It was hard, at least in my experience CSS is not transferred.

573
01:12:50,000 --> 01:13:06,000
So, I attended a talk at Stanford, a couple weeks ago, and they did a study of the security of the code generated I think it was by co pilot co generator, and they found that it was dismal.

574
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:15,000
In fact, programmers who use co pilot produced less secure code than those who did not, but the ones who did thought their code was more secure.

575
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:22,000
And the conclusion of that study was that the assistant lacks context.

576
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Why you were showing some of the examples I was just scrolling through the text and it looks like it's the same problem there that the assistant is losing context.

577
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Yeah, no, that was the other annoying thing was that it was losing context and there were a few times when I realized that it just had completely forgotten what the source code for for a part of it or so I would copy and paste something

578
01:13:53,000 --> 01:14:05,000
much earlier and said, you know, and here's the dysfunction or here's this HTML that we're using and that often would would help because now it was in the

579
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I wasn't thinking so much of forgetting as it seemed that in some cases, it, it misinterpreted the context of what you were asking, because it didn't know the environment in which you were working.

580
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Yeah.

581
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Well,

582
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:43,000
generally, I mean like that example where with the video one where I had originally intended. Oh, I should put my video back on.

583
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I originally intended it, you know that I can point with my finger in different directions and that would indicate which way the pen would move or something, as opposed to the way it came up with.

584
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:11,000
But I was just as happy with that rather than trying to get it to interpret it the way I intended, but in terms of security I thought it was pretty impressive that it really tried hard to talk me out of

585
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:16,000
using the API key in a static web page like this.

586
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:33,000
On the other hand, I, you know, I said, you know, make it a password field and, you know, it's, it's not really a problem that that a user is putting the key into a web page like this but of course,

587
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:47,000
once it's hosted somewhere, somebody has to trust that you're not stealing their key. But of course the, the, in every one of these cases you can look at the source and the code is actually quite clear and nice.

588
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:56,000
So somebody could see that the API key isn't sent off to somebody or something.

589
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:12,000
In this kind of context, I don't think the security is such an issue, but obviously, if you're, if you're making some kind of web service and, you know, there's a lot more things to think about in terms of security.

590
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Yeah, I was, I wasn't so worried about security for these apps as much as the context issue. There's so much implicit context that the programmer has that the assistant does not.

591
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Right. Yeah, I mentioned it'll be quite different if I was doing some really large project.

592
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Because, you know, so the, this last one, the illustrated story generator, it did, it was a little more than 500 lines of JavaScript. So, and, and that's actually too large for the, at least the default version of chat GBT I can't say, you know, paste in this entire 500 lines and say

593
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:05,000
now let's modify it in some way it's just too much context.

594
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:22,000
I mean, too many tokens for it to be fit its context window. So there are these limitations of course, the, like I just saw today some startup saying that they've got a context window of 50,000 tokens.

595
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,000
I've been, you know, using I think 8000 or something.

596
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:51,000
So that, and there's even some research paper that claimed that they had a million token context that was using some clever algorithms because you know that the context normally is a quadratic complexity but if you're clever you can make it and log in or something.

597
01:17:52,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Well, I think I really blown away again this is this is a very nice expression to how people seem to be using the, the artificial intelligence devices or personal persona.

598
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:44,000
This is as a component in a larger system. And I guess now the ads we see for, you know, doctors who use AI and get us to use AI and people who play with AI, driven games and so forth, has, has more context in terms of the current AI systems.

599
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I think that's a very useful thing.

600
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Yeah, you're back.

601
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Yeah.

602
01:18:52,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I think I really appreciate the introduction because I had not thought about this part of it I always thought the hard part was twiddling the knobs on the, the data used to do on the AI but

603
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,000
talking to the AI turns out to be complex enough.

604
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Yeah.

605
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:36,000
You know, if you go back a year you had to give it, you know, several examples of what you were intending and had to engineer your prompt kind of carefully to get it to be pretty competent but GPT for as I mentioned I really just seem much more of a natural

606
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
conversation.

607
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:48,000
And I'm really I'm curious to see how, you know, a 12 year old deals with such things, you know, better.

608
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Probably better than you and I do.

609
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Yeah, that's right.

610
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:12,000
My, my, my favorite story is watching a non speaking child sort of order six months old stealing his mother's phone and the per password and then using it to play his video.

611
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:19,000
This is this is adaptation at a very low rate or very high rate.

612
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Somebody's got a somebody's got a question you watching the hands up Dennis.

613
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
I'm not watching it at all.

614
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:31,000
When you want to you want to call people and put them up.

615
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Yeah, go ahead you got your hand up.

616
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Yeah, I was just, I had a question about the

617
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Edges of the models understanding of programming.

618
01:20:47,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Is there any indication or what was your experience in finding the edges of the, what the model knew about a particular API or

619
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:10,000
programming in general. I mean, I was specifically thinking, I use a prototypical inheritance over the newer class inheritance.

620
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:18,000
And I was just kind of curious there's probably a lot less, a lot fewer code examples of that on the, on the internet.

621
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:27,000
So probably less training data for that. I was just curious if you encountered, if you looked at how the model degrades.

622
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Yeah.

623
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Well, I didn't really but I did notice something about the, it's coding styles.

624
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:48,000
And it wasn't always consistent like a tiny example but maybe illustrative one is that this problem about, you know, where the JavaScript's trying to

625
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:56,000
get an element from the down, but the page hasn't loaded yet.

626
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:02,000
It was using sometimes this unload as a, you know,

627
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:15,000
and sometimes it was using a listener to on DOM content loaded which is what I've read is the proper better way of doing it that on load is an older way that isn't as good but it's still kind of works.

628
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
So, so there is this kind of.

629
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Two different issues one is whether it's on load or on DOM, DOM content load but also as to whether it's using, it's actually using at event listener, or whether it's just setting the listener directly.

630
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:35,000
And it kind of wasn't consistent sometimes we'll do one sometimes the other.

631
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:44,000
You know, again, because I guess most of the programs that it looked at were consistent about which way they would deal with that.

632
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:50,000
It was like a real program.

633
01:22:50,000 --> 01:23:07,000
No, but it's just a bit of a real programmer tends to have us one style in which they stick to for those kinds of tasks, but it was I thought it was a bit odd that it was kind of flip flopping about whether it was, you know, which way would deal with that problem.

634
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:13,000
So real programmers coming back six months later will not be consistent with what.

635
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Thank you.

636
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Very cool things that can do.

637
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,000
It's a program and you mentioned the prompt engineering.

638
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Before, so that it may not require any more prompt engineering almost a row. So that is recognized usable and you also mentioned role playing.

639
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:41,000
And one of the techniques. So now, there are more developing stress on techniques rather than engineering of prompt itself.

640
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:55,000
But maybe from your experience of this project, what these techniques would you found helpful. Maybe you found something of your own that helped you to navigate the chat activity for

641
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Well, the problem a little bit was that I was always really the underlying motivation for a lot of this was thinking about, you know, what kind of learning materials or experience what I imagine like a high school student having.

642
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:30,000
So I was rarely kind of role playing myself I was often, you know, pretending in my head, you know, to be maybe a high school student that knew a little bit about this and not much about that or something.

643
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
So,

644
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:45,000
maybe I'll try this soon, which is, especially if it's a younger child. I think if you set up the context better and I say, you know,

645
01:24:46,000 --> 01:25:00,000
you're going to be helping a nine year old who doesn't know much about programming to build the apps that they want, you know, be sure to explain things carefully and not use too much technical jar.

646
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:15,000
And he's set up set up a context like that, that it would tend to, I believe it but I even tried this that it would tend to use language much more appropriate to communicate with a nine year old because it does.

647
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:33,000
There's two examples of where I said, after built an app I said, what could you explain to a nine year old, or it's young child how this app would work it. I thought I did a great job of explaining it in, in, you know, the right kind of vocabulary and right kind of analogies.

648
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:50,000
But I should really come up with a task that actually I want to do and just stop pretending to be a student and just see, you know, what I could accomplish as well.

649
01:25:51,000 --> 01:26:06,000
And I'm doing it this way is I've always been interested in kids and programming, but also there's, there's an awful lot of real programmers that are using chat GPT to get accomplished their day to day tasks so I thought this would be a more

650
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:22,000
experience to think in terms of, of how children might deal with this. And when I say children of course it could be an adult that knows no programming a hobbyist or something but I mean, a non expert programmer.

651
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:41,000
That's very interesting. Thank you. It's also recently I listened to podcast is Lee chasen, which was an educator who also worked now on the content strategies, and he used role playing in the beginning like you did with the child to actually create a content for the

652
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:57,000
So in terms of how they can study the material because he was a teacher before, I think, teaching history, and uses this prompts like overall playing to actually create the tasks that the children would understand or certain

653
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:08,000
output that would be better suited for the audience so levels of understanding so I think what you also showed here is how well it works.

654
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:21,000
In terms of this first example that you show so that it really stands you nicely as if you were indeed a younger adult or child so

655
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:36,000
my question may be also additionally meant to ask what other techniques you found helpful like maybe not only role playing, but something else maybe some structuring or given examples.

656
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Yeah, so part of the problem is that at the same time I was doing this I was also curious about, could it really understand me if I just say, you know,

657
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:10,000
maybe, etc, and I don't really list everything out or if I say, you know, that was it didn't go high enough without giving much detail so I was kind of really wanting to explore how how well I could do if I was

658
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:22,000
not being very careful to give it detailed instructions or large amount of context just to see, you know, could it still respond appropriately.

659
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:44,000
One thing I should say too is that, you know, the Khan Academy has been working with chat gpt to make a tutor that they gave a demo of teaching algebra, and it was really very very good at giving hints and giving feedback when the

660
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:51,000
student did things wrong, but the student said well what's the answer what's how do I solve this it'll keep saying.

661
01:28:51,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I'm not going to give you the answer but here's a hint or something so it was they had set up the context appropriately so it would not.

662
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:16,000
You know, it would be a good pedagogical tutor and not be just a chat bot that would just give you answers when asked when asked for it but in my my case I thought.

663
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:25,000
I thought that it was, I could have maybe tried to early on say something like well you're giving me too much.

664
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:39,000
Code you know I want to be able to do more of it myself or something I could have done that and it would have taken me longer but it would have given me more hints and more little pieces to put together, but.

665
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:55,000
It was the way I did it I think was plausible for some students that you know would be happy with these pretty high level things and some copying pasting but also some creating things on their own.

666
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Thank you.

667
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Any more questions.

668
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
And thank you very, very much.

669
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:19,000
I love being educated in this in this area, and I qualify as a barely marginal student, I guess.

670
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:28,000
And what happens is I think that we see examples of reverse aging that the young kids are much more successful than the older people.

671
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:34,000
And, you know, I'd like to claim that I know how to do things, but oftentimes don't.

672
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Thank you very much.
