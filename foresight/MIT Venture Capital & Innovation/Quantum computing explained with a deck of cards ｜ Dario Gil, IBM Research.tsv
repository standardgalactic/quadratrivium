0	5680	We have a very exciting last talk coming up.
5680	8480	Dario Gill will take us into a quantum world.
8480	13680	Dario is the vice president of science and solutions at IBM research where he leads over
13680	20840	1,500 engineers that are researching technologies in physics, math, healthcare, life sciences
20840	22560	and others.
22560	27640	And while some of you will think a quantum world that's too far out, I'm very sure Dario
27640	29080	will tell us otherwise.
29080	31080	So come up here on stage, please.
31080	33080	Thank you.
33080	35000	Thank you.
35000	40880	I was joking with Mark that we couldn't pick an easier topic to end the day than quantum
40880	41880	computing.
41880	48920	But I'll try to make it, you know, entertaining and hopefully easy to understand.
48920	55240	I'm going to start with a reference to this term of beautiful ideas.
55240	61440	And it came from hosting a filmmaker about a year and a half ago in the laboratory I
61440	66120	just showed you at the T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights.
66120	71000	And it was a filmmaker that directed this documentary called Particle Fever that I don't
71000	75320	know if you've had a chance to watch, but I highly recommend it.
75320	80240	It's about the team that was pursuing the discovery of the Higgs boson in the largest
80240	82920	physics experiment ever conducted.
82920	87760	And a major character in the film is a professor from Stanford.
87760	91520	And at the beginning of the film, he said something that really captivated me.
91520	99440	He said the thing that differentiates scientists is a purely artistic ability to discern what
99440	108040	is a good idea, what is a beautiful idea, what is worth spending time on, and most importantly,
108040	114080	what is a problem that is sufficiently interesting, yet sufficiently difficult, that it hasn't
114080	120120	yet been solved, but the time for solving it has come now.
120120	127400	So I want to tell you about this beautiful idea whose time for solving it has come now.
127400	131680	And that is the possibility to create quantum computers.
131680	137480	If you look at how we have created the basis of the information revolution and you trace
137480	142800	it back to other beautiful ideas like what Shannon taught us to think about the world
142800	144240	of information abstractly.
144240	151660	If you look at an old punch card and DNA, we've come to appreciate that both carry something
151660	154440	in common, they carry information.
154440	162040	And Shannon told us that this world of bits could be decoupled from its physical implementation.
162040	168680	That was really interesting, but in fundamental ways, it went too far, leaving too much physics
168680	170640	out.
170640	178960	So here is two scientists that work at IBM Research, Charlie Bennett on the right continues
178960	187320	to work in our laboratory and is at IBM Fellow, and they asked the question at the time of
187320	195280	is there a fundamental limit to how efficient number crunching can be, computing can be.
195280	201080	And when they asked that question as physicists, they ended up with a very surprising answer,
201080	202760	and they found the answer to be no.
202760	208520	It turns out that number crunching can be thermodynamically reversible.
208520	215040	This led to an exploration of what is the relationship between physics and information.
215040	218680	And there was a now famous conference that was jointly organized between IBM Research
218680	224840	and MIT at Endicott House, where this topic was exploring more detail, and the plenary
224840	229440	speaker was none other than Richard Feynman.
229440	236120	And Feynman proposed in that conference that if you wanted to simulate nature, we should
236120	239800	build a quantum computer.
239800	243640	And I'm going to explain to you what that means and how it's created and the problems
243640	245240	that it will solve.
245240	249080	But first I got to tell you what is a fundamental idea.
249080	254120	The fundamental idea, just like we have bits in the classical world that can be a zero
254120	263160	or a one, in a quantum computer you have qubits, which stands for quantum bits.
263160	270000	Now the difference is that they can be a zero, a one, or both at the same time.
270000	274560	That exploits a principle of quantum physics called superposition.
274560	279760	And it sounds weird and crazy, but it's true.
279760	285840	Now to give you this an ease that you should feel when you talk about quantum information
285840	290640	and quantum computing, I'm going to give you a very simple example, a thought experiment
290640	293200	that also happens to be true.
293200	296280	So let's imagine that we're going to solve this problem.
296280	300480	The problem involves you have four cards, three are identical, one is different, one
300480	302400	is a queen.
302400	307320	We shuffle the cards and we put them face down.
307320	312480	And the problem we're going to solve together is find the queen.
312480	314640	We're going to be assisted by two computers.
314640	319200	One is a classical computer, one is a quantum computer.
319200	324360	So what we do is we turn them down and we load them into memory.
324360	330920	So we use four memory slots, the cards are identical, we put zeros, the one that has
330920	332800	a queen, we put a one.
332800	336520	So in our four slots, we'll have three zeros and one is a one.
336520	338720	We load them on the two computers.
338720	343120	Now we ask to write a program to find the queen, find the one.
343120	346280	How would it be done classically?
346280	349880	You would go and pick a random number, you don't know where it is.
349880	354040	You go look under that memory slot, see if it's a one, if not, you go to the next slot
354040	355480	and so on and so on.
355480	361000	On average, it would take you the equivalent of two and a half turns to find it.
361000	366120	It turns out that with a two-qubit quantum computer for this problem, you can always
366120	371240	solve it in one shot.
371240	378920	So that uneasy feeling that you have now should be an explanation that quantum computer is
378920	381920	not just about building a faster computer.
381920	390080	It is building something that is fundamentally different than a classical computer.
390080	396800	Now a way to think about it, an abstraction of it, is that a quantum computer is always
396800	400600	going to have a classical computer next to it.
400600	402760	They have to go together.
402760	409240	So you have a classical set of bits, right, the problem that you're trying to explore
409240	413400	and what the quantum computer is going to allow you to do is to explore this exponential
413400	419560	number of states, these two to the n, where n is the number of qubits that you have.
419560	425120	So now we have relatively small quantum computers with few qubits, but just think of the number
425120	430200	that by the time you have 50 qubits, you have two to the 50 states.
430200	433120	That's a phenomenally large number.
433120	438680	But in the end, after you explore this number of states, you go back to a classical output,
438680	444280	a string of zeros and ones that you interpret with a normal computer.
444280	446360	So why is this interesting?
446360	452160	And I think in this audience, I don't need to explain in great detail what exponentials
452160	455240	mean and why two to the 50 is a very large number.
455240	459760	But it's still, I think it's an interesting way to communicate the power of this and I
459760	462200	like to map it to some problems.
462200	467560	But I like to go after this apocryphal story that actually IBM used in the 1960s to explain
467560	469760	to people the power of exponentials.
469760	475760	And it had to do with the person who invented chess that goes to the emperor and says, well,
475760	481120	here's this wonderful game and asks, what do you want in return?
481120	486920	And the person who invented is give me a grain of rice on the first day for the first square.
486920	490000	On the second day, you give me twice as much.
490000	496040	And on the third square, third day, you give me twice as much as the day before.
496040	500400	And the emperor agrees promptly that that seems quite reasonable.
500400	505200	And after a week, you only have 127 grains.
505200	510280	After a month, you have more rice than you'll eat in your lifetime for sure.
510280	515640	But just by the time you get to the end of the chessboard, you have more rice than Mount
515640	517960	Everest.
517960	525680	So there are a large number of problems in the world that have this characteristic that
525680	528160	they blow up exponentially.
528160	532480	And a dirty secret in the world of computing is that we obviously talk a lot about all
532480	536560	the things that computers can solve and can solve a lot of things.
536560	540560	But then there's a lot of things that computers cannot solve.
540560	546000	And very interestingly, they cannot solve it now, nor ever.
546000	551520	And the reason is because they have this exponential built into them.
551520	559600	So take as an example this fairly simple equation, factoring.
559600	567160	So if I have a number m that is made out of the multiplication of two large prime numbers,
567160	574680	and I only give you m and I ask you, find me p and q, it turns out that that is phenomenally
574680	575680	difficult to solve.
575680	580400	There's no other way but to divide it sort of sequentially by prime numbers.
580400	586680	So in fact, it's so difficult, we use it as the basis of all encryption.
586680	591760	But if you had a very large universal fault tolerant quantum computer, which is many, many
591760	596920	years away, you could solve that problem in seconds, what would take billions of years
596920	599240	in a classical computer.
599240	605560	That tells you something about the power of what is going to be possible.
605560	610720	Think chemistry as a problem, because it also has this characteristic that it blows
610720	613920	up exponentially if you try to calculate it.
613920	619800	This equation that you see here is very interesting, because it's predicted to occur at the ocean
619800	627360	floor near volcanic sites, and famously has been hypothesized to be the basis of the formation
627360	630120	of life on Earth.
630120	636320	But if you take a molecule like iron sulfide, and you try to do relatively simple calculations
636320	642160	with a normal machine, it turns out that we're not very accurate.
642160	648060	And the reason is that molecules form when electron orbitals overlap, and the calculation
648060	652480	of each orbital requires a quantum mechanical calculation.
652480	657880	So for that simple molecule, you have on the order of 76 orbitals, and two to the power
657880	664680	of 76 is intractable with a classical computer, so we cannot solve it.
664680	670520	Again on this theme of our assumptions that computers solve everything, but they don't.
670520	674800	If you look at calculating, for example, the bond length of a simple molecule like calcium
674800	680680	monofluoride, we still get it off by a factor of two, even using the larger supercomputers
680680	683160	in the world.
683160	687000	For me, this has been very interesting, this recognition of all these problems we cannot
687000	688720	solve.
688720	695720	It's also true in optimization problems that are the basis of logistics and routing and,
695720	697720	you know, portfolio optimization.
697720	702320	There's tons and tons of problems in which at best we do approximations, but we're far
702320	708560	from optimal because the number of possibilities is enormous.
708560	713840	So if there's one message I want to be able to come across is that we have these easy
713840	719280	problems which is the world where classical computers fit and the problems it solves.
719280	724760	But then these other hard problems that go outside, and if you don't believe that P equals
724760	729080	NP, which I would say the majority of mathematicians don't believe that that is the case, that
729080	734840	those problems are hard for a reason, the only avenue to go and tackle that, aside from
734840	739720	approximations, will be through the creation of quantum computers.
739720	743040	So where are we?
743040	748560	We believe that small practical quantum computers are going to be possible and we're building
748560	750840	them now.
750840	754080	It requires reinventing the whole stack.
754080	757440	The device is different, it's not the traditional transistors.
757440	762840	As an example, this is the device we use for the quantum computers that we create at IBM
762840	766280	based on superconducting Joseph's subjunctions.
766280	770920	And you're seeing an example of one of these devices, it's a superconducting device, and
770920	775120	because it's superconducting, you have to cool it.
775120	778440	So this is what a small quantum computer looks like.
778440	784200	What you're seeing here is something called a dilution refrigerator, and this quantum processor
784200	791220	sits at the bottom of this refrigerator at the nice temperature of 15 millikelvin.
791220	797380	So that is colder than outer space, where we have to put this quantum processor in.
797380	804780	This is what, for example, a 16 qubit quantum processor looks like, and inside you see the
804780	809540	square where the qubits are, and you see these squiggly lines, which is these coupling resonators
809540	814980	that allow you to send the information and couple to the qubits to send the information.
814980	820980	This is what the wiring looks like into the refrigerator going into a quantum processor.
820980	827500	It's these coaxial cables, and because the way you send information to a quantum processor
827500	835220	is through a series of microwave pulses that go in, and then you're able to take it out.
835220	841100	Now, if you look at pictures of what computers were like in the 40s and the 50s, it's kind
841100	843820	of like where we are today.
843820	847980	That's what a quantum computer, that's the signal processing required to actually send
847980	852780	all those signals down the coaxial cables, it looks like that.
852780	857340	But we've also seen this movie before, in the sense that we know how much progress we
857340	862140	have made from those early systems, and while we don't anticipate that quantum computers
862140	869660	will be on your phone because it requires cryogenic cooling, we definitely believe that access
869660	875380	to quantum computers in the cloud will be something that people will be able to leverage
875380	878260	behind the scenes, even not knowing.
878260	884220	Because we believe that, we created a small quantum computer last year and we made it available
884220	889380	to the world, and something called the IBM Quantum Experience, and all of you can go
889380	894540	and log in and have access to this, it's available for free, it's a five qubit machine, and since
894540	898900	we launched it, we have over 36,000 users from over a hundred countries that have been
898900	905020	doing it, and 15 scientific publications have gone on it, and people are learning how to
905020	910140	program and to learn about this new world and what is being created.
910140	915140	And you can actually run things on this, so I was telling you about these chemistry problems,
915140	921220	so this is an example of the expected theoretical calculation and the actual calculation on a
921220	924540	small quantum machine of hydrogen.
924540	929980	So we're starting to solve small problems, and what is coming in the years ahead in the
929980	937620	next few years will be machines that no classical computer will be able to emulate.
937620	945020	Because by the time you have order of 50 qubits, think about that, that's two to the 50 states,
945020	949420	and no classical machine will be able to emulate what that can do.
949420	953820	And that is new territory, and that's the territory we're all going to enter.
953820	958260	And now is the most interesting part, because it will be the path of discovery of what we
958260	963660	can do and what value we can create on problems we couldn't solve before.
963660	970900	So I'll close with Feynman, who proposed this original idea of creating these quantum machines,
970900	976860	and his inimitable style, he said nature isn't classical, dammit.
976860	981820	And if you want to make a simulation of nature, you better make it quantum mechanical.
981820	986540	And by golly, it's a wonderful problem because it doesn't look so easy.
986540	987540	Thank you.
987540	988540	Thank you.
988540	989540	APPLAUSE
