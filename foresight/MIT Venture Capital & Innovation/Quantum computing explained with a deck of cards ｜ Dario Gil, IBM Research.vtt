WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
We have a very exciting last talk coming up.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.480
Dario Gill will take us into a quantum world.

00:08.480 --> 00:13.680
Dario is the vice president of science and solutions at IBM research where he leads over

00:13.680 --> 00:20.840
1,500 engineers that are researching technologies in physics, math, healthcare, life sciences

00:20.840 --> 00:22.560
and others.

00:22.560 --> 00:27.640
And while some of you will think a quantum world that's too far out, I'm very sure Dario

00:27.640 --> 00:29.080
will tell us otherwise.

00:29.080 --> 00:31.080
So come up here on stage, please.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.080
Thank you.

00:33.080 --> 00:35.000
Thank you.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.880
I was joking with Mark that we couldn't pick an easier topic to end the day than quantum

00:40.880 --> 00:41.880
computing.

00:41.880 --> 00:48.920
But I'll try to make it, you know, entertaining and hopefully easy to understand.

00:48.920 --> 00:55.240
I'm going to start with a reference to this term of beautiful ideas.

00:55.240 --> 01:01.440
And it came from hosting a filmmaker about a year and a half ago in the laboratory I

01:01.440 --> 01:06.120
just showed you at the T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights.

01:06.120 --> 01:11.000
And it was a filmmaker that directed this documentary called Particle Fever that I don't

01:11.000 --> 01:15.320
know if you've had a chance to watch, but I highly recommend it.

01:15.320 --> 01:20.240
It's about the team that was pursuing the discovery of the Higgs boson in the largest

01:20.240 --> 01:22.920
physics experiment ever conducted.

01:22.920 --> 01:27.760
And a major character in the film is a professor from Stanford.

01:27.760 --> 01:31.520
And at the beginning of the film, he said something that really captivated me.

01:31.520 --> 01:39.440
He said the thing that differentiates scientists is a purely artistic ability to discern what

01:39.440 --> 01:48.040
is a good idea, what is a beautiful idea, what is worth spending time on, and most importantly,

01:48.040 --> 01:54.080
what is a problem that is sufficiently interesting, yet sufficiently difficult, that it hasn't

01:54.080 --> 02:00.120
yet been solved, but the time for solving it has come now.

02:00.120 --> 02:07.400
So I want to tell you about this beautiful idea whose time for solving it has come now.

02:07.400 --> 02:11.680
And that is the possibility to create quantum computers.

02:11.680 --> 02:17.480
If you look at how we have created the basis of the information revolution and you trace

02:17.480 --> 02:22.800
it back to other beautiful ideas like what Shannon taught us to think about the world

02:22.800 --> 02:24.240
of information abstractly.

02:24.240 --> 02:31.660
If you look at an old punch card and DNA, we've come to appreciate that both carry something

02:31.660 --> 02:34.440
in common, they carry information.

02:34.440 --> 02:42.040
And Shannon told us that this world of bits could be decoupled from its physical implementation.

02:42.040 --> 02:48.680
That was really interesting, but in fundamental ways, it went too far, leaving too much physics

02:48.680 --> 02:50.640
out.

02:50.640 --> 02:58.960
So here is two scientists that work at IBM Research, Charlie Bennett on the right continues

02:58.960 --> 03:07.320
to work in our laboratory and is at IBM Fellow, and they asked the question at the time of

03:07.320 --> 03:15.280
is there a fundamental limit to how efficient number crunching can be, computing can be.

03:15.280 --> 03:21.080
And when they asked that question as physicists, they ended up with a very surprising answer,

03:21.080 --> 03:22.760
and they found the answer to be no.

03:22.760 --> 03:28.520
It turns out that number crunching can be thermodynamically reversible.

03:28.520 --> 03:35.040
This led to an exploration of what is the relationship between physics and information.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.680
And there was a now famous conference that was jointly organized between IBM Research

03:38.680 --> 03:44.840
and MIT at Endicott House, where this topic was exploring more detail, and the plenary

03:44.840 --> 03:49.440
speaker was none other than Richard Feynman.

03:49.440 --> 03:56.120
And Feynman proposed in that conference that if you wanted to simulate nature, we should

03:56.120 --> 03:59.800
build a quantum computer.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.640
And I'm going to explain to you what that means and how it's created and the problems

04:03.640 --> 04:05.240
that it will solve.

04:05.240 --> 04:09.080
But first I got to tell you what is a fundamental idea.

04:09.080 --> 04:14.120
The fundamental idea, just like we have bits in the classical world that can be a zero

04:14.120 --> 04:23.160
or a one, in a quantum computer you have qubits, which stands for quantum bits.

04:23.160 --> 04:30.000
Now the difference is that they can be a zero, a one, or both at the same time.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.560
That exploits a principle of quantum physics called superposition.

04:34.560 --> 04:39.760
And it sounds weird and crazy, but it's true.

04:39.760 --> 04:45.840
Now to give you this an ease that you should feel when you talk about quantum information

04:45.840 --> 04:50.640
and quantum computing, I'm going to give you a very simple example, a thought experiment

04:50.640 --> 04:53.200
that also happens to be true.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.280
So let's imagine that we're going to solve this problem.

04:56.280 --> 05:00.480
The problem involves you have four cards, three are identical, one is different, one

05:00.480 --> 05:02.400
is a queen.

05:02.400 --> 05:07.320
We shuffle the cards and we put them face down.

05:07.320 --> 05:12.480
And the problem we're going to solve together is find the queen.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.640
We're going to be assisted by two computers.

05:14.640 --> 05:19.200
One is a classical computer, one is a quantum computer.

05:19.200 --> 05:24.360
So what we do is we turn them down and we load them into memory.

05:24.360 --> 05:30.920
So we use four memory slots, the cards are identical, we put zeros, the one that has

05:30.920 --> 05:32.800
a queen, we put a one.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.520
So in our four slots, we'll have three zeros and one is a one.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.720
We load them on the two computers.

05:38.720 --> 05:43.120
Now we ask to write a program to find the queen, find the one.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.280
How would it be done classically?

05:46.280 --> 05:49.880
You would go and pick a random number, you don't know where it is.

05:49.880 --> 05:54.040
You go look under that memory slot, see if it's a one, if not, you go to the next slot

05:54.040 --> 05:55.480
and so on and so on.

05:55.480 --> 06:01.000
On average, it would take you the equivalent of two and a half turns to find it.

06:01.000 --> 06:06.120
It turns out that with a two-qubit quantum computer for this problem, you can always

06:06.120 --> 06:11.240
solve it in one shot.

06:11.240 --> 06:18.920
So that uneasy feeling that you have now should be an explanation that quantum computer is

06:18.920 --> 06:21.920
not just about building a faster computer.

06:21.920 --> 06:30.080
It is building something that is fundamentally different than a classical computer.

06:30.080 --> 06:36.800
Now a way to think about it, an abstraction of it, is that a quantum computer is always

06:36.800 --> 06:40.600
going to have a classical computer next to it.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.760
They have to go together.

06:42.760 --> 06:49.240
So you have a classical set of bits, right, the problem that you're trying to explore

06:49.240 --> 06:53.400
and what the quantum computer is going to allow you to do is to explore this exponential

06:53.400 --> 06:59.560
number of states, these two to the n, where n is the number of qubits that you have.

06:59.560 --> 07:05.120
So now we have relatively small quantum computers with few qubits, but just think of the number

07:05.120 --> 07:10.200
that by the time you have 50 qubits, you have two to the 50 states.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.120
That's a phenomenally large number.

07:13.120 --> 07:18.680
But in the end, after you explore this number of states, you go back to a classical output,

07:18.680 --> 07:24.280
a string of zeros and ones that you interpret with a normal computer.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.360
So why is this interesting?

07:26.360 --> 07:32.160
And I think in this audience, I don't need to explain in great detail what exponentials

07:32.160 --> 07:35.240
mean and why two to the 50 is a very large number.

07:35.240 --> 07:39.760
But it's still, I think it's an interesting way to communicate the power of this and I

07:39.760 --> 07:42.200
like to map it to some problems.

07:42.200 --> 07:47.560
But I like to go after this apocryphal story that actually IBM used in the 1960s to explain

07:47.560 --> 07:49.760
to people the power of exponentials.

07:49.760 --> 07:55.760
And it had to do with the person who invented chess that goes to the emperor and says, well,

07:55.760 --> 08:01.120
here's this wonderful game and asks, what do you want in return?

08:01.120 --> 08:06.920
And the person who invented is give me a grain of rice on the first day for the first square.

08:06.920 --> 08:10.000
On the second day, you give me twice as much.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.040
And on the third square, third day, you give me twice as much as the day before.

08:16.040 --> 08:20.400
And the emperor agrees promptly that that seems quite reasonable.

08:20.400 --> 08:25.200
And after a week, you only have 127 grains.

08:25.200 --> 08:30.280
After a month, you have more rice than you'll eat in your lifetime for sure.

08:30.280 --> 08:35.640
But just by the time you get to the end of the chessboard, you have more rice than Mount

08:35.640 --> 08:37.960
Everest.

08:37.960 --> 08:45.680
So there are a large number of problems in the world that have this characteristic that

08:45.680 --> 08:48.160
they blow up exponentially.

08:48.160 --> 08:52.480
And a dirty secret in the world of computing is that we obviously talk a lot about all

08:52.480 --> 08:56.560
the things that computers can solve and can solve a lot of things.

08:56.560 --> 09:00.560
But then there's a lot of things that computers cannot solve.

09:00.560 --> 09:06.000
And very interestingly, they cannot solve it now, nor ever.

09:06.000 --> 09:11.520
And the reason is because they have this exponential built into them.

09:11.520 --> 09:19.600
So take as an example this fairly simple equation, factoring.

09:19.600 --> 09:27.160
So if I have a number m that is made out of the multiplication of two large prime numbers,

09:27.160 --> 09:34.680
and I only give you m and I ask you, find me p and q, it turns out that that is phenomenally

09:34.680 --> 09:35.680
difficult to solve.

09:35.680 --> 09:40.400
There's no other way but to divide it sort of sequentially by prime numbers.

09:40.400 --> 09:46.680
So in fact, it's so difficult, we use it as the basis of all encryption.

09:46.680 --> 09:51.760
But if you had a very large universal fault tolerant quantum computer, which is many, many

09:51.760 --> 09:56.920
years away, you could solve that problem in seconds, what would take billions of years

09:56.920 --> 09:59.240
in a classical computer.

09:59.240 --> 10:05.560
That tells you something about the power of what is going to be possible.

10:05.560 --> 10:10.720
Think chemistry as a problem, because it also has this characteristic that it blows

10:10.720 --> 10:13.920
up exponentially if you try to calculate it.

10:13.920 --> 10:19.800
This equation that you see here is very interesting, because it's predicted to occur at the ocean

10:19.800 --> 10:27.360
floor near volcanic sites, and famously has been hypothesized to be the basis of the formation

10:27.360 --> 10:30.120
of life on Earth.

10:30.120 --> 10:36.320
But if you take a molecule like iron sulfide, and you try to do relatively simple calculations

10:36.320 --> 10:42.160
with a normal machine, it turns out that we're not very accurate.

10:42.160 --> 10:48.060
And the reason is that molecules form when electron orbitals overlap, and the calculation

10:48.060 --> 10:52.480
of each orbital requires a quantum mechanical calculation.

10:52.480 --> 10:57.880
So for that simple molecule, you have on the order of 76 orbitals, and two to the power

10:57.880 --> 11:04.680
of 76 is intractable with a classical computer, so we cannot solve it.

11:04.680 --> 11:10.520
Again on this theme of our assumptions that computers solve everything, but they don't.

11:10.520 --> 11:14.800
If you look at calculating, for example, the bond length of a simple molecule like calcium

11:14.800 --> 11:20.680
monofluoride, we still get it off by a factor of two, even using the larger supercomputers

11:20.680 --> 11:23.160
in the world.

11:23.160 --> 11:27.000
For me, this has been very interesting, this recognition of all these problems we cannot

11:27.000 --> 11:28.720
solve.

11:28.720 --> 11:35.720
It's also true in optimization problems that are the basis of logistics and routing and,

11:35.720 --> 11:37.720
you know, portfolio optimization.

11:37.720 --> 11:42.320
There's tons and tons of problems in which at best we do approximations, but we're far

11:42.320 --> 11:48.560
from optimal because the number of possibilities is enormous.

11:48.560 --> 11:53.840
So if there's one message I want to be able to come across is that we have these easy

11:53.840 --> 11:59.280
problems which is the world where classical computers fit and the problems it solves.

11:59.280 --> 12:04.760
But then these other hard problems that go outside, and if you don't believe that P equals

12:04.760 --> 12:09.080
NP, which I would say the majority of mathematicians don't believe that that is the case, that

12:09.080 --> 12:14.840
those problems are hard for a reason, the only avenue to go and tackle that, aside from

12:14.840 --> 12:19.720
approximations, will be through the creation of quantum computers.

12:19.720 --> 12:23.040
So where are we?

12:23.040 --> 12:28.560
We believe that small practical quantum computers are going to be possible and we're building

12:28.560 --> 12:30.840
them now.

12:30.840 --> 12:34.080
It requires reinventing the whole stack.

12:34.080 --> 12:37.440
The device is different, it's not the traditional transistors.

12:37.440 --> 12:42.840
As an example, this is the device we use for the quantum computers that we create at IBM

12:42.840 --> 12:46.280
based on superconducting Joseph's subjunctions.

12:46.280 --> 12:50.920
And you're seeing an example of one of these devices, it's a superconducting device, and

12:50.920 --> 12:55.120
because it's superconducting, you have to cool it.

12:55.120 --> 12:58.440
So this is what a small quantum computer looks like.

12:58.440 --> 13:04.200
What you're seeing here is something called a dilution refrigerator, and this quantum processor

13:04.200 --> 13:11.220
sits at the bottom of this refrigerator at the nice temperature of 15 millikelvin.

13:11.220 --> 13:17.380
So that is colder than outer space, where we have to put this quantum processor in.

13:17.380 --> 13:24.780
This is what, for example, a 16 qubit quantum processor looks like, and inside you see the

13:24.780 --> 13:29.540
square where the qubits are, and you see these squiggly lines, which is these coupling resonators

13:29.540 --> 13:34.980
that allow you to send the information and couple to the qubits to send the information.

13:34.980 --> 13:40.980
This is what the wiring looks like into the refrigerator going into a quantum processor.

13:40.980 --> 13:47.500
It's these coaxial cables, and because the way you send information to a quantum processor

13:47.500 --> 13:55.220
is through a series of microwave pulses that go in, and then you're able to take it out.

13:55.220 --> 14:01.100
Now, if you look at pictures of what computers were like in the 40s and the 50s, it's kind

14:01.100 --> 14:03.820
of like where we are today.

14:03.820 --> 14:07.980
That's what a quantum computer, that's the signal processing required to actually send

14:07.980 --> 14:12.780
all those signals down the coaxial cables, it looks like that.

14:12.780 --> 14:17.340
But we've also seen this movie before, in the sense that we know how much progress we

14:17.340 --> 14:22.140
have made from those early systems, and while we don't anticipate that quantum computers

14:22.140 --> 14:29.660
will be on your phone because it requires cryogenic cooling, we definitely believe that access

14:29.660 --> 14:35.380
to quantum computers in the cloud will be something that people will be able to leverage

14:35.380 --> 14:38.260
behind the scenes, even not knowing.

14:38.260 --> 14:44.220
Because we believe that, we created a small quantum computer last year and we made it available

14:44.220 --> 14:49.380
to the world, and something called the IBM Quantum Experience, and all of you can go

14:49.380 --> 14:54.540
and log in and have access to this, it's available for free, it's a five qubit machine, and since

14:54.540 --> 14:58.900
we launched it, we have over 36,000 users from over a hundred countries that have been

14:58.900 --> 15:05.020
doing it, and 15 scientific publications have gone on it, and people are learning how to

15:05.020 --> 15:10.140
program and to learn about this new world and what is being created.

15:10.140 --> 15:15.140
And you can actually run things on this, so I was telling you about these chemistry problems,

15:15.140 --> 15:21.220
so this is an example of the expected theoretical calculation and the actual calculation on a

15:21.220 --> 15:24.540
small quantum machine of hydrogen.

15:24.540 --> 15:29.980
So we're starting to solve small problems, and what is coming in the years ahead in the

15:29.980 --> 15:37.620
next few years will be machines that no classical computer will be able to emulate.

15:37.620 --> 15:45.020
Because by the time you have order of 50 qubits, think about that, that's two to the 50 states,

15:45.020 --> 15:49.420
and no classical machine will be able to emulate what that can do.

15:49.420 --> 15:53.820
And that is new territory, and that's the territory we're all going to enter.

15:53.820 --> 15:58.260
And now is the most interesting part, because it will be the path of discovery of what we

15:58.260 --> 16:03.660
can do and what value we can create on problems we couldn't solve before.

16:03.660 --> 16:10.900
So I'll close with Feynman, who proposed this original idea of creating these quantum machines,

16:10.900 --> 16:16.860
and his inimitable style, he said nature isn't classical, dammit.

16:16.860 --> 16:21.820
And if you want to make a simulation of nature, you better make it quantum mechanical.

16:21.820 --> 16:26.540
And by golly, it's a wonderful problem because it doesn't look so easy.

16:26.540 --> 16:27.540
Thank you.

16:27.540 --> 16:28.540
Thank you.

16:28.540 --> 16:29.540
APPLAUSE
