1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
We have a very exciting last talk coming up.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,480
Dario Gill will take us into a quantum world.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,680
Dario is the vice president of science and solutions at IBM research where he leads over

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:20,840
1,500 engineers that are researching technologies in physics, math, healthcare, life sciences

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,560
and others.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,640
And while some of you will think a quantum world that's too far out, I'm very sure Dario

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,080
will tell us otherwise.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,080
So come up here on stage, please.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,080
Thank you.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,000
Thank you.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,880
I was joking with Mark that we couldn't pick an easier topic to end the day than quantum

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,880
computing.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:48,920
But I'll try to make it, you know, entertaining and hopefully easy to understand.

14
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,240
I'm going to start with a reference to this term of beautiful ideas.

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:01,440
And it came from hosting a filmmaker about a year and a half ago in the laboratory I

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,120
just showed you at the T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights.

17
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,000
And it was a filmmaker that directed this documentary called Particle Fever that I don't

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,320
know if you've had a chance to watch, but I highly recommend it.

19
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,240
It's about the team that was pursuing the discovery of the Higgs boson in the largest

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,920
physics experiment ever conducted.

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,760
And a major character in the film is a professor from Stanford.

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,520
And at the beginning of the film, he said something that really captivated me.

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,440
He said the thing that differentiates scientists is a purely artistic ability to discern what

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:48,040
is a good idea, what is a beautiful idea, what is worth spending time on, and most importantly,

25
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,080
what is a problem that is sufficiently interesting, yet sufficiently difficult, that it hasn't

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:00,120
yet been solved, but the time for solving it has come now.

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:07,400
So I want to tell you about this beautiful idea whose time for solving it has come now.

28
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,680
And that is the possibility to create quantum computers.

29
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,480
If you look at how we have created the basis of the information revolution and you trace

30
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,800
it back to other beautiful ideas like what Shannon taught us to think about the world

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,240
of information abstractly.

32
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,660
If you look at an old punch card and DNA, we've come to appreciate that both carry something

33
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,440
in common, they carry information.

34
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:42,040
And Shannon told us that this world of bits could be decoupled from its physical implementation.

35
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,680
That was really interesting, but in fundamental ways, it went too far, leaving too much physics

36
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,640
out.

37
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,960
So here is two scientists that work at IBM Research, Charlie Bennett on the right continues

38
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:07,320
to work in our laboratory and is at IBM Fellow, and they asked the question at the time of

39
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:15,280
is there a fundamental limit to how efficient number crunching can be, computing can be.

40
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,080
And when they asked that question as physicists, they ended up with a very surprising answer,

41
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,760
and they found the answer to be no.

42
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,520
It turns out that number crunching can be thermodynamically reversible.

43
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:35,040
This led to an exploration of what is the relationship between physics and information.

44
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,680
And there was a now famous conference that was jointly organized between IBM Research

45
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,840
and MIT at Endicott House, where this topic was exploring more detail, and the plenary

46
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,440
speaker was none other than Richard Feynman.

47
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,120
And Feynman proposed in that conference that if you wanted to simulate nature, we should

48
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,800
build a quantum computer.

49
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,640
And I'm going to explain to you what that means and how it's created and the problems

50
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,240
that it will solve.

51
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,080
But first I got to tell you what is a fundamental idea.

52
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,120
The fundamental idea, just like we have bits in the classical world that can be a zero

53
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:23,160
or a one, in a quantum computer you have qubits, which stands for quantum bits.

54
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:30,000
Now the difference is that they can be a zero, a one, or both at the same time.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,560
That exploits a principle of quantum physics called superposition.

56
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,760
And it sounds weird and crazy, but it's true.

57
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:45,840
Now to give you this an ease that you should feel when you talk about quantum information

58
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,640
and quantum computing, I'm going to give you a very simple example, a thought experiment

59
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,200
that also happens to be true.

60
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,280
So let's imagine that we're going to solve this problem.

61
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,480
The problem involves you have four cards, three are identical, one is different, one

62
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,400
is a queen.

63
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,320
We shuffle the cards and we put them face down.

64
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,480
And the problem we're going to solve together is find the queen.

65
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,640
We're going to be assisted by two computers.

66
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,200
One is a classical computer, one is a quantum computer.

67
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,360
So what we do is we turn them down and we load them into memory.

68
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,920
So we use four memory slots, the cards are identical, we put zeros, the one that has

69
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,800
a queen, we put a one.

70
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,520
So in our four slots, we'll have three zeros and one is a one.

71
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,720
We load them on the two computers.

72
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,120
Now we ask to write a program to find the queen, find the one.

73
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,280
How would it be done classically?

74
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,880
You would go and pick a random number, you don't know where it is.

75
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,040
You go look under that memory slot, see if it's a one, if not, you go to the next slot

76
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,480
and so on and so on.

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,000
On average, it would take you the equivalent of two and a half turns to find it.

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,120
It turns out that with a two-qubit quantum computer for this problem, you can always

79
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,240
solve it in one shot.

80
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:18,920
So that uneasy feeling that you have now should be an explanation that quantum computer is

81
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,920
not just about building a faster computer.

82
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:30,080
It is building something that is fundamentally different than a classical computer.

83
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,800
Now a way to think about it, an abstraction of it, is that a quantum computer is always

84
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,600
going to have a classical computer next to it.

85
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,760
They have to go together.

86
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:49,240
So you have a classical set of bits, right, the problem that you're trying to explore

87
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,400
and what the quantum computer is going to allow you to do is to explore this exponential

88
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,560
number of states, these two to the n, where n is the number of qubits that you have.

89
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,120
So now we have relatively small quantum computers with few qubits, but just think of the number

90
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,200
that by the time you have 50 qubits, you have two to the 50 states.

91
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,120
That's a phenomenally large number.

92
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,680
But in the end, after you explore this number of states, you go back to a classical output,

93
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,280
a string of zeros and ones that you interpret with a normal computer.

94
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,360
So why is this interesting?

95
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,160
And I think in this audience, I don't need to explain in great detail what exponentials

96
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,240
mean and why two to the 50 is a very large number.

97
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,760
But it's still, I think it's an interesting way to communicate the power of this and I

98
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,200
like to map it to some problems.

99
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,560
But I like to go after this apocryphal story that actually IBM used in the 1960s to explain

100
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,760
to people the power of exponentials.

101
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,760
And it had to do with the person who invented chess that goes to the emperor and says, well,

102
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,120
here's this wonderful game and asks, what do you want in return?

103
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,920
And the person who invented is give me a grain of rice on the first day for the first square.

104
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,000
On the second day, you give me twice as much.

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,040
And on the third square, third day, you give me twice as much as the day before.

106
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,400
And the emperor agrees promptly that that seems quite reasonable.

107
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,200
And after a week, you only have 127 grains.

108
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,280
After a month, you have more rice than you'll eat in your lifetime for sure.

109
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,640
But just by the time you get to the end of the chessboard, you have more rice than Mount

110
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,960
Everest.

111
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:45,680
So there are a large number of problems in the world that have this characteristic that

112
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,160
they blow up exponentially.

113
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,480
And a dirty secret in the world of computing is that we obviously talk a lot about all

114
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,560
the things that computers can solve and can solve a lot of things.

115
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,560
But then there's a lot of things that computers cannot solve.

116
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,000
And very interestingly, they cannot solve it now, nor ever.

117
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,520
And the reason is because they have this exponential built into them.

118
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:19,600
So take as an example this fairly simple equation, factoring.

119
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:27,160
So if I have a number m that is made out of the multiplication of two large prime numbers,

120
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:34,680
and I only give you m and I ask you, find me p and q, it turns out that that is phenomenally

121
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
difficult to solve.

122
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,400
There's no other way but to divide it sort of sequentially by prime numbers.

123
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,680
So in fact, it's so difficult, we use it as the basis of all encryption.

124
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,760
But if you had a very large universal fault tolerant quantum computer, which is many, many

125
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,920
years away, you could solve that problem in seconds, what would take billions of years

126
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,240
in a classical computer.

127
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:05,560
That tells you something about the power of what is going to be possible.

128
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,720
Think chemistry as a problem, because it also has this characteristic that it blows

129
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,920
up exponentially if you try to calculate it.

130
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,800
This equation that you see here is very interesting, because it's predicted to occur at the ocean

131
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:27,360
floor near volcanic sites, and famously has been hypothesized to be the basis of the formation

132
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,120
of life on Earth.

133
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:36,320
But if you take a molecule like iron sulfide, and you try to do relatively simple calculations

134
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,160
with a normal machine, it turns out that we're not very accurate.

135
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,060
And the reason is that molecules form when electron orbitals overlap, and the calculation

136
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,480
of each orbital requires a quantum mechanical calculation.

137
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,880
So for that simple molecule, you have on the order of 76 orbitals, and two to the power

138
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,680
of 76 is intractable with a classical computer, so we cannot solve it.

139
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,520
Again on this theme of our assumptions that computers solve everything, but they don't.

140
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,800
If you look at calculating, for example, the bond length of a simple molecule like calcium

141
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,680
monofluoride, we still get it off by a factor of two, even using the larger supercomputers

142
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,160
in the world.

143
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,000
For me, this has been very interesting, this recognition of all these problems we cannot

144
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,720
solve.

145
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,720
It's also true in optimization problems that are the basis of logistics and routing and,

146
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,720
you know, portfolio optimization.

147
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,320
There's tons and tons of problems in which at best we do approximations, but we're far

148
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,560
from optimal because the number of possibilities is enormous.

149
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,840
So if there's one message I want to be able to come across is that we have these easy

150
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,280
problems which is the world where classical computers fit and the problems it solves.

151
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,760
But then these other hard problems that go outside, and if you don't believe that P equals

152
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,080
NP, which I would say the majority of mathematicians don't believe that that is the case, that

153
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:14,840
those problems are hard for a reason, the only avenue to go and tackle that, aside from

154
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,720
approximations, will be through the creation of quantum computers.

155
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,040
So where are we?

156
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,560
We believe that small practical quantum computers are going to be possible and we're building

157
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,840
them now.

158
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,080
It requires reinventing the whole stack.

159
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,440
The device is different, it's not the traditional transistors.

160
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,840
As an example, this is the device we use for the quantum computers that we create at IBM

161
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,280
based on superconducting Joseph's subjunctions.

162
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,920
And you're seeing an example of one of these devices, it's a superconducting device, and

163
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,120
because it's superconducting, you have to cool it.

164
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,440
So this is what a small quantum computer looks like.

165
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,200
What you're seeing here is something called a dilution refrigerator, and this quantum processor

166
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:11,220
sits at the bottom of this refrigerator at the nice temperature of 15 millikelvin.

167
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:17,380
So that is colder than outer space, where we have to put this quantum processor in.

168
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:24,780
This is what, for example, a 16 qubit quantum processor looks like, and inside you see the

169
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,540
square where the qubits are, and you see these squiggly lines, which is these coupling resonators

170
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,980
that allow you to send the information and couple to the qubits to send the information.

171
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,980
This is what the wiring looks like into the refrigerator going into a quantum processor.

172
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:47,500
It's these coaxial cables, and because the way you send information to a quantum processor

173
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:55,220
is through a series of microwave pulses that go in, and then you're able to take it out.

174
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:01,100
Now, if you look at pictures of what computers were like in the 40s and the 50s, it's kind

175
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,820
of like where we are today.

176
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,980
That's what a quantum computer, that's the signal processing required to actually send

177
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,780
all those signals down the coaxial cables, it looks like that.

178
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,340
But we've also seen this movie before, in the sense that we know how much progress we

179
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,140
have made from those early systems, and while we don't anticipate that quantum computers

180
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:29,660
will be on your phone because it requires cryogenic cooling, we definitely believe that access

181
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:35,380
to quantum computers in the cloud will be something that people will be able to leverage

182
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,260
behind the scenes, even not knowing.

183
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:44,220
Because we believe that, we created a small quantum computer last year and we made it available

184
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,380
to the world, and something called the IBM Quantum Experience, and all of you can go

185
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:54,540
and log in and have access to this, it's available for free, it's a five qubit machine, and since

186
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,900
we launched it, we have over 36,000 users from over a hundred countries that have been

187
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:05,020
doing it, and 15 scientific publications have gone on it, and people are learning how to

188
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:10,140
program and to learn about this new world and what is being created.

189
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,140
And you can actually run things on this, so I was telling you about these chemistry problems,

190
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:21,220
so this is an example of the expected theoretical calculation and the actual calculation on a

191
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,540
small quantum machine of hydrogen.

192
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:29,980
So we're starting to solve small problems, and what is coming in the years ahead in the

193
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:37,620
next few years will be machines that no classical computer will be able to emulate.

194
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:45,020
Because by the time you have order of 50 qubits, think about that, that's two to the 50 states,

195
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:49,420
and no classical machine will be able to emulate what that can do.

196
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,820
And that is new territory, and that's the territory we're all going to enter.

197
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,260
And now is the most interesting part, because it will be the path of discovery of what we

198
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:03,660
can do and what value we can create on problems we couldn't solve before.

199
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:10,900
So I'll close with Feynman, who proposed this original idea of creating these quantum machines,

200
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,860
and his inimitable style, he said nature isn't classical, dammit.

201
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,820
And if you want to make a simulation of nature, you better make it quantum mechanical.

202
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,540
And by golly, it's a wonderful problem because it doesn't look so easy.

203
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,540
Thank you.

204
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,540
Thank you.

205
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,540
APPLAUSE
