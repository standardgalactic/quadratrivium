Processing Overview for MIT Venture Capital & Innovation
============================
Checking MIT Venture Capital & Innovation/Quantum computing explained with a deck of cards ï½œ Dario Gil, IBM Research.txt
1. Quantum computing represents a significant leap from classical computing, tackling problems that are currently intractable for traditional computers. The belief is that practical quantum computers can be built, and many are already being developed and used.

2. IBM has been at the forefront of this technology, using superconducting Josephson junctions cooled to an extremely low temperature (15 millikelvin) in a dilution refrigerator to create a quantum processor.

3. A 16-qubit quantum processor is an example of what these devices look like, with qubits and coupling resonators that facilitate the transmission of information via microwave pulses.

4. Quantum computing's history parallels early computing, and while quantum computers won't be as ubiquitous as classical computers (like those on phones), they will likely be accessible through the cloud.

5. IBM has made a 5-qubit quantum processor available to the public through the IBM Quantum Experience, which has been used by over 36,000 users from around the world and has contributed to 15 scientific publications since its inception.

6. As quantum computers scale up to 50 or more qubits, they will enter a realm where no classical computer can emulate their capabilities, opening up new possibilities for solving complex problems in areas like chemistry, optimization, cryptography, and more.

7. The future of quantum computing promises a new era of discovery and value creation, as we explore the full potential of nature's inherently quantum mechanics.

8. Richard Feynman famously stated that if we are to simulate nature, our models must be quantum mechanical, highlighting the importance and challenge of developing quantum computers.
