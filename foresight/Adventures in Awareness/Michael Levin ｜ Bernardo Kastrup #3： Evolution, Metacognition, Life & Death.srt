00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,560
Tonight is, for the most part, a dialogue between Michael and Bernardo on topics that will include

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,840
evolution, platonic realm, metacognition, boundaries of self, potentially life and

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,520
death, some new research that Michael has to talk about. And then if there's time,

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,200
oftentimes there's less time for Q&A in the sessions where we have a guest,

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,520
then we'll do Q&A for sure. And then if there isn't time this week, then we obviously have Bernardo

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,080
back for another, I think, three weeks before we have another guest. So,

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,320
and Michael, you do quite a lot of other formats where people can follow your work

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,000
with this Q&A opportunity if someone's not in a kind of institution.

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:59,120
Yeah, the closest is the blog. So, people will often either comment on specific blog posts or

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,520
just email me questions. If they're good questions, I will eventually post the answers on the blog.

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,600
I've got one scheduled, one set of Q&A scheduled for, I think, next week from some stuff people

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,280
sent me. So, yeah, you can always. Like a live Q&A or one that people write in?

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,840
For now, it's been writing, I am actually going to schedule a live one. That is something

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
that I want to do. So, I'm just figuring out some other logistics, but I will do that.

15
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,240
Cool. Feel free to send us the details and we'll send it out to this community as well.

16
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,480
I'm sure people from here will join. Great idea.

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,680
And also, yeah, just to tell everyone that I've been following this blog. I'm not trained

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:45,440
in science, didn't even do biology at high school. And I'm still able to follow the core

19
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,040
ideas and you write it in such a fashion that someone without scientific training can follow.

20
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,880
So, I really appreciate that. Thanks. That's great. Yeah, that was my hope. That's great.

21
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,320
Yeah. And I'm learning a lot. And sometimes I use a bit of chat GPT to fill in some gaps.

22
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,480
I'm a little late. Sorry about that.

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,520
Cool. Welcome. Made me nervous there for a second.

24
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,360
Have I ever let you down? Not yet.

25
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,280
Cool. Great. So, welcome. How are you doing, Bernardo?

26
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,640
Say it again. How are you doing?

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,280
I'm okay. I had a busy day so far. I'm still a bit out of it. I have to take three deep breaths

28
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
and be here. I'm going to get there.

29
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,080
So, potentially, you can relax and enjoy for the first few minutes. I was discussing with

30
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,160
Michael earlier that maybe we could start on some of your thoughts, Michael, on evolution.

31
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,720
You mentioned a couple of papers or new research that you might want to mention. Does that feel

32
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,120
good for you if you kind of discuss a little bit? Thoughts and evolution potentially into the

33
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,240
platonic realm? Sure. Yeah. That sounds fine. Yeah. Okay. Cool.

34
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,800
Okay. Well, let's see. So, in somewhat random order, there's a couple of interesting things

35
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,720
that have come out of our lab recently. One has to do with this notion of hyperembryos.

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,840
What we were looking at is horizontal information transfer between embryogenesis. Normally,

37
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,080
you get this idea that you've got an embryo and the reason that that embryo is able to complete

38
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,760
its journey from being a single cell to being a complex organism is because of its genome and

39
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,200
the maternal proteins that are in the egg. So, it's kind of vertical, right? It's all the stuff

40
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,080
that's handed down by the mother. And so, one of the interesting things that we discovered,

41
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,320
and this was led by a PhD student in my group, Angela Tung. And what we found is something

42
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,840
really interesting, that when you challenge a collection of embryos with some kind of

43
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,560
teratogen, a teratogen is anything that tends to disrupt their ability to complete

44
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,400
development normally. So, it could be a drug. It could be a genetic change. It could be a

45
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,640
vibration. It could be all kinds of things. So, it turns out that when you challenge them with

46
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,400
something like this, it turns out that large groups of embryos do much better at resisting it

47
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,760
than small groups. And when we studied it, we found out that not only is there kind of like this

48
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:33,040
group effect, but also it is not sufficient to have a group that's made up of some individuals

49
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,440
that never got challenged in the first place. And the reason this is important is this.

50
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,480
Our initial very simple model for what's going on, why would large groups of embryos develop

51
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,560
better than small groups? Initially, you might think that, well, what's happening is that

52
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:55,840
if everybody's getting affected by some kind of perturbation, then by the kind of group

53
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,400
collective intelligence idea that everybody has some gaps in their knowledge of how to make an

54
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,000
embryo, but everybody's gaps are in a different place. And so, as long as they all exchange

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,760
information, then everybody can have all the information they need. That's a very simple

56
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,680
way to think about it. It's the way they used to do this thing where people would guess the

57
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,480
number of jelly beans in a jar in a store. And no individual person was ever close, but the group

58
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:23,520
actually, if you average the group, they were always spot on. So, initially, we thought that

59
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,360
was it. But if that was it, then what you could do is you could make a large group that's composed

60
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,480
of a bunch of embryos that were exposed to the stressor, and then a bunch of embryos that were

61
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,360
never exposed, and those would have all the information they need. And that should be even

62
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,960
better because they could then instruct all the others because they're not stressed out. They

63
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,040
would have all the information. Turns out that doesn't actually work. The only individuals

64
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,760
that can help the group do better is ones that have been exposed to the stressor themselves.

65
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,840
It's kind of this weird thing, like Mark Solm told me once that in psychoanalysis,

66
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,840
in order to do psychoanalysis, you have to have been yourself, psychoanalyzed. It's this kind of

67
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,080
participatory thing. So, it's kind of interesting that you can only help if you've already seen

68
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:14,240
that stressor. And then we use some tools to actually see the embryos communicate with each

69
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,960
other. It's pretty wild. You can actually see waves of information born by ATP and calcium

70
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,960
signaling and some other things that sort of propagate across the collective. And it has a

71
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,720
couple of implications. One implication it has is that lots of prior studies that look at the

72
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:40,320
toxicity of various compounds, but didn't actually look at, well, how many embryos did we expose

73
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,600
at one time, right? But all these studies use different numbers of, you know, Pzibar fission

74
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,240
fin, tadpoles and so on. All of those numbers are actually not correct. What you're getting is not

75
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,200
an assessment of how dangerous is that compound, what you're getting is an assessment after it's

76
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,800
been corrected for by the group. So, you're not seeing the raw effect. You're seeing the whatever

77
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:08,800
effect is left over after the group has done its repair functions. And so, this is very important

78
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,920
because what it suggests is that the information that's needed to have very stable development

79
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,760
is not just vertical. It's not just something that every embryo has everything they need and all

80
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:26,080
of that. It's actually a kind of a group construction project. And not only functionally does the

81
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,480
group do better than the large group do better than the small group or individuals, we looked at

82
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,960
gene expression and we asked what novel genes do large groups express that small groups and

83
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,440
individuals don't express. And there's a huge collection of new genes that they turn on,

84
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,080
which suggests that this idea that normally in developmental biology, what you're studying is

85
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,440
the way individual cells help each other and cooperate and compete. And then you get this

86
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,720
nice embryo as a result. You can take that one level higher and say that, okay, so that's embryogenesis,

87
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,880
but there's a kind of hyper embryo, which is the large group, which has its own dynamics,

88
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,160
which you can actually complete the journey better. And we can see the communication between its parts,

89
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,600
between the embryos, and it has its own transcriptome. The large, this hyper embryo actually has its

90
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:20,320
own set of gene expressions that otherwise its parts wouldn't have. So it's a really interesting

91
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,520
example. You know, we study a lot the collective intelligence of individual cells and how it scales

92
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,680
up to be this amazing morphogenetic system that can create anatomies and repair them and so on.

93
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,840
But I guess it goes one step further. It's actually the individuals are talking to each other too.

94
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:43,280
And you can imagine from that, you can imagine some therapeutic applications because what if you

95
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:49,680
could fake the effect, right? So what if in the therapeutic context, once we understand what it

96
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:57,440
is that they're saying to each other, we could possibly impose that artificially in therapeutic

97
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,280
context, whatever the signals are. So we're in the process of trying to understand

98
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:09,200
what the communication is like, what are they saying to each other really? It's quite a puzzle

99
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,440
because the information that you need to actually create a complex embryo is there's a lot of

100
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,080
information. It's unlikely that all of that information can be propagated by something as simple

101
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:28,960
as a single, let's say a level of ATP or whatever the molecules are going to end up being. So they

102
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,000
must be modulated somehow. It's really interesting to ask, how are they actually communicating and

103
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,920
what are they actually saying to each other? And then just this notion of the fact that, yes,

104
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,880
you've got individual genomes that do their job within individual embryos, but the magic of

105
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,120
morphogenesis and that collective intelligence doesn't stop at the border of the individual.

106
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,680
It actually is able to use the computational power of the large collective. So that's

107
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,080
that's one of the things that we did recently. Anybody any questions or comments about that?

108
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Someone asked, horizontal gene expression like in mycelium? Someone just been reading entangled

109
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:23,680
lives. Yes and no. Yes in the sense that the genes that want embryo express are going to

110
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,920
affect the genes that others in the group express, but we don't think, we haven't

111
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,920
to conclusively ruled that, but we don't think it's that it's literally propagating the material,

112
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,200
like it's like we don't think it's propagating transcription factors or anything like that.

113
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,080
I think what's happening in this issue will come up again when we talk about some new thoughts we

114
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,840
had on memory, that what it's doing is basically compressing a large amount of information into

115
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,160
a very narrow communications channel. So something that can be easily encoded by small molecules

116
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,880
that are propagating, and then the recipient embryos have to sort of re-inflate or reinterpret it

117
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,440
for their own for their own context. I have a feeling that's what's going on, but yeah in

118
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,520
effect what you're seeing is horizontal transfer of information that ends up controlling gene

119
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,960
expression. So just a super naive question. So you've got an embryo that will do something

120
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:20,960
specific on its own, and then it behaves differently if it's surrounded by lots of other

121
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,840
embryos. So with a human, I'll just be like, okay, well a human can count. I'll be like,

122
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,680
great, there's lots of people around me, you know, I'll copy what they're doing, but

123
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,120
is it just passively receiving it from me? Because presumably you don't think they're

124
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,920
metacognitively counting how many embryos around them? Does the question make sense?

125
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,720
Yes, yes it does. I don't have any evidence that that they're aware that they're counting,

126
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,640
for sure, I'm not claiming that. But I think that what's happening is, and we actually in the paper,

127
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,800
I mean, you know, if anybody's interested in the details of the computational stuff,

128
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,520
we actually have in the paper a model of cellular automata acting this way, that is a noisy

129
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,320
cellular automata where each one has a problem following a specific set of rules, but there's

130
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,480
a large collective and they get to communicate and eventually you get pretty robust communication

131
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,440
in the group. So no, I don't think they're explicitly counting, but I think by virtue of

132
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,320
the mechanisms that couple them together, you in effect get something that is quite sensitive to

133
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:32,400
the number of individuals in your cohort. Then now at any point, obviously Bernardo,

134
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:38,640
just feel free to comment or speculate if something Mike was saying sparks an interest.

135
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,080
And is what you just said related to that blog that you put that was talking about a paper

136
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,800
around the surprising emergent behavior of algorithms?

137
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,360
The algorithms, well, I mean, I do think that all of these things are connected in interesting

138
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,600
ways. The algorithms were a different paper. So what we did there, if people want to talk about

139
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,320
that, what we did there was, you know, one of the things about biology is that when you look at

140
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,640
systems, no matter how simple you think it is, you know, even if it's some kind of a,

141
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,560
you know, a microbe or something, there's always more mechanism. There's always more

142
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,480
different components and different amazing things that you didn't know were there.

143
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:28,720
And so that makes it kind of hard to really study emergent surprising outcomes because

144
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,840
someone could say, well, there's probably a mechanism specifically for that. You haven't

145
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:39,360
found it yet. So what we wanted to do was to really come up with a system that is extremely

146
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,840
minimal, extremely transparent, where there was no place to hide, where it was obvious what all

147
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,320
the parts were, and then use all the tools of the frameworks we've been developing to ask,

148
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,640
okay, is there some kind of emergent, maybe some proto cognitive capacity here? And what we chose

149
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,880
were very simple things called sorting algorithms. So for anybody who doesn't do computer science

150
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,200
in the audience, what these are are very simple sets of steps. There's usually the whole algorithm

151
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,840
is usually six or seven lines of code. It's very simple. And what it's designed to do is to take

152
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,320
an array of numbers that are jumbled up. So it's an array of integers, let's say a hundred of them,

153
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,560
and they're jumbled up in random order. And there's an algorithm, which is a set of steps

154
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,440
that will, if you follow it consistently, what it will eventually do is sort the whole list

155
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,440
into let's say ascending or descending order. These are things that computer science has been

156
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,440
studying for decades, every computer science student starts up learning these things. And

157
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:40,160
the thing about them is that they are extremely, they're simple, they're short, they're transparent,

158
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,560
you can see all the parts, there is no more mechanism to be discovered. And they're completely

159
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:50,480
deterministic. And people think they know what these things do, right? So you think, we've studied

160
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:57,200
them. And so what we wanted to do was to ask the question of what surprising behaviors could be

161
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,000
hiding, even in something as simple as this. And it's important, because oftentimes, for example,

162
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,800
people who do AI and things like that, somebody said to me recently, there's no emergent behavior

163
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,560
in language models, I know how they're built, I know what all the parts are. And I think this

164
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:21,920
is a very dangerous attitude. And so we wanted to kind of study this very simple system. And so

165
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:31,200
what we did there was we visualized the process of a couple of interesting twists. One is that we

166
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:38,640
visualize the process of sorting these numbers as a walk through what we call sortedness space.

167
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,320
So they start out in a region of that space where it completely jumbled, but everybody eventually

168
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,560
gets to this place over here where everybody's in order. And they have to sort of, during the

169
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,120
sorting, that string sort of makes its way to that spot. And what we did was we said, okay,

170
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,400
instead of having one sort of omniscient algorithm that gets to move around all the pieces,

171
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,080
which is normally what happens, there's an algorithm that moves around all the parts,

172
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,480
what we did was we put the algorithm inside the cells themselves. This again, will be important

173
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,960
when we later talk about the memories, because what we basically did made was self sorting arrays.

174
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:14,080
So what we said is each number, it on its own has the ability to look to its left and to its right

175
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,480
and decide how happy it is about where it is. And if it's not happy, so if I'm a five, I want the

176
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,640
four to my left and the six to my right. And if I don't see that, I want to move somewhere else

177
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:29,680
where I'm going to be happier. That's it. There is no global control. And so

178
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,880
what we found when you do that, a couple of interesting things happen. First thing that

179
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:42,480
happens is that it still works. So when you do this and you have this self sorting data where

180
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,080
you're erasing a little bit the distinction between the algorithm and the data, because now the data

181
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:55,280
itself has a little bit of action to it. What happens is, yeah, they still sort, but now you

182
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,760
can do two interesting things. One thing you can do is you can make some broken cells. So you can

183
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,000
ask, what happens if some of the cells are broken? They can be broken in one of two ways. Either

184
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,320
they refuse to move when they are asked to move, or they're completely broken in that,

185
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,480
they don't even try to move. They're not just broken for others, but they won't swap with others,

186
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,600
but also they don't initiate. So they're just completely frozen in place. Normally in these

187
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,360
algorithms, you assume that the hardware is reliable. That is, if the algorithm says swap to

188
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,280
four and the seven, they swap and you never even go back to check, well, did it work? Like, was it

189
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,960
swapped or not? You normally don't check. This again will come up as important. The importance

190
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,840
of unreliable hardware, I think in biology and cognition is really critical. So we made this

191
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,720
kind of unreliable hardware example where they're sorting and eventually you get to

192
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,400
some numbers that will not move. They're frozen. And that turns out to be a barrier in their journey

193
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:01,440
towards being sorted. It's like what the definition of intelligence I like, which is the ability to

194
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,000
get your goals met despite all kinds of novel circumstances, perturbations, the ability to

195
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,280
basically to navigate your space and get your goals met. So these algorithms, just to be clear,

196
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,160
there is no code in there about what happens if the number doesn't move. How am I doing? Did the

197
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,440
number move? Nothing like that in there. The algorithm stays exactly the same. But what does

198
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,760
it do when you do interrupt its journey with these barriers that cannot be passed? William

199
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,360
James had this notion of navigating barriers and so on. And there's a concept of delayed

200
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,600
gratification. The deal with delayed gratification is that when you come to a barrier, if you're

201
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,680
a magnet and there's two magnets and they try to come together, you put a piece of wood between them.

202
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,240
The magnets all they're ever going to do is stay there stuck between the wood. The magnet is never

203
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,760
going to go around to get to its goal because it has no delayed gratification. It would have to

204
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,880
go further from its goal in order to get to where it's going. Magnets don't do that. But some animals

205
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,080
do. Some autonomous vehicles do and so on. What do these algorithms do? So it turns out that without

206
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,440
any special code for it, what the algorithms will do if you actually track the sorting. So here

207
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,320
it moves along, moves along, it's the sorting everything. It meets the barrier. When it meets

208
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:21,440
the barrier, it actually goes around and in order to go around, the array actually gets less sorted

209
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,160
over time. It has a degree of delayed gratification. The whole thing gets worse for a little while

210
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,560
until it moves all the other numbers around that broken cell and then things improve. So it has the

211
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,760
ability to temporarily get further away from its goal. And it only does this when it encounters

212
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:44,000
a broken cell. But it has this really primitive but already a tiny capacity for delayed gratification

213
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,880
that is completely emergent. It is nowhere in the algorithm for it to do that. We had no idea

214
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:55,840
this was going to do that. And so just a couple things and I'd love to hear what Bernardo has

215
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:02,560
to say about it. One thing is this little bit of delayed gratification. And then there was

216
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:08,240
another thing that we found. Because we've now put the algorithm inside the cells themselves,

217
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,680
that lets you do something weird. It lets you create a chimeric array where some of the cells

218
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,760
are following one sorting algorithm, let's say bubble sort. The other ones are following a

219
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,640
different algorithm, let's say selection sort or something. So it's like a chimeric. We make this

220
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:30,000
in the lab all the time. We'll make like a frog allotle which has a bunch of frog embryonic cells

221
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,760
with some axolotl embryonic cells. And each of them are following different algorithms. You

222
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,880
put them together and you ask, what does this collective make? When different parts are constructing

223
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,120
things under different rules, what's going to be the outcome? So we can make these chimeric strings.

224
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,200
We can make these algorithms where the different cells are following different rules. And then

225
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:55,600
we found something really wild, which is this. Imagine that you assign, we called it, actually

226
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,440
this was Adam Goldstein came up with this idea. He called it the algotype. You know,

227
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,560
genotype, phenotype. So this is the algotype. The algotype is the algorithm that any cell happens to

228
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:12,320
be following. At the beginning, so you've got your array of 100 numbers and it's random. The

229
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,520
numbers are randomly distributed and they are randomly assigned to algotypes. There's two

230
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:25,200
different algorithms randomly assigned. When you do this, let's just ask, what are the,

231
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,280
what's the probability that when I look at my neighbor, my neighbor is the same algotype as me?

232
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,680
At the beginning, it's 50% because they're random. So your neighbor has a 50% shot of being the same

233
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:42,560
type of cell as you are. At the end, after all the sorting is done, same thing. It's also going to

234
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,200
be 50% because the algorithm doesn't care about algotype at all. There is nothing in the algorithm

235
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,440
that says, what algorithm am I? What algorithm is my neighbor? There's nothing in there about that.

236
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,600
At the end, everybody's got to get sorted according to their integer value, which means the

237
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,040
algotypes again are shuffled and random. So 50% at the beginning, 50% at the end.

238
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,880
But what happens in the middle? If you track what happens in the middle, what happens in the middle

239
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:12,400
is the, that we call it the clustering, this idea of this measure of how, what's the probability

240
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,840
that I like to hang out with my buddies. There's the same type of things as I am, the same algorithm.

241
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:25,760
It actually goes like this. So in the middle, it goes up and then it comes down again. So for the,

242
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:34,000
for the, and it's, it's this, it's this amazing emergent tendency for these guys to cluster

243
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,200
during their journey. And it's sort of, it's, to me, it all, it's, it's, it's all, it almost

244
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,240
reflects like the, the, you know, the existential condition of life in a, in the universe, like

245
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,840
eventually the physics of the world, you have to obey the physics of the world and eventually

246
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,120
they're going to pull you apart. But in the meantime, even though it's not prescribed by the rules

247
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,120
that you're following, you get to do something interesting, something new and interesting,

248
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,040
and maintain a pattern at a high level. You get to make these, these clusters, these, these temporary,

249
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:15,200
temporary emergent patterns of, of, of like, like-minded, like-minded data that are, that are

250
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,960
sitting there. Eventually they're going to get pulled apart. But in the meantime, they're there.

251
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,120
And, you know, we did, we did some other things. Like we said, what happens if we relieve the

252
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,280
pressure a little bit of getting pulled apart, how, you know, give them a little more opportunity to

253
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,320
do what they really want, which is to cluster. And the way you can do that is you can allow duplicate

254
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,120
numbers. You can say, okay, we'll have 10 fives and 10 sixes and 10 sevens. And that way you can

255
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,840
sort of have your cake and eat it too. You can be a bunch of fives in the right place. But the,

256
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,480
but the first few fives can be one algotype and the next few can be in the, and if you do that,

257
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,160
they cluster even more. So you can see that the pressure to cluster is quite significant.

258
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,120
They just get pulled apart at the end. So I'll just stop here. But the point of, the point of that

259
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,560
whole, that whole, that whole journey is to just start to look at these extremely simple, transparent,

260
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:09,680
deterministic systems and already find interesting capabilities. And now, I mean, there's some

261
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,080
practical stuff to be done here too, because they're, they're doing this clustering for free,

262
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,480
basically, right? We're not, you know, it doesn't require any additional computational power. So

263
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,680
if that happened to be something useful, or if we coupled it to something useful,

264
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,000
you could imagine getting some more squeezing some more, some more juice out of, of a process

265
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,800
that's already happening anyway. So I'll stop here and see what, see what Bernardo has to say.

266
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,240
Is it okay Bernardo to just quickly see if a simple example will help anyone that,

267
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,520
because I've read it. So I think I'm following you, Michael. But it is a simple illustration of this

268
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,040
is normally assorting, let's say I've got a classroom full of school full of children,

269
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,280
and I want them all lined up in terms of height. And normally the teacher would stand there,

270
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,760
okay, you stand there, you stand there, you stand there, and kind of sorts it from a bird's eye view.

271
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,440
And what you've done is told each child, if the one on the right of you is, you taller than you,

272
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,920
swap sides, or if it's shorter than you, go further that way. And so you've given instructions

273
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:12,960
to each child to move. Is that close to what you've? Yeah, that's close. And so to following that,

274
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,240
that analogy, you've told them to sort by height, and eventually they do sort by height. But what

275
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,640
you notice is that halfway through, they also seem to be clustering by eye color. So for some reason,

276
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,560
they're also hanging out together by some other property that your instructions to them do not

277
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,760
reference at all. So there's some other property that they seem to, that they

278
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,880
seem to want to group by, and then eventually, of course, they'll sort out by height, and there's

279
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,400
no necessary relationship between height and eye color. So eventually it'll go away. But in the

280
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,360
meantime, you notice that, hey, there are these groups of similarly eye-colored individuals.

281
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,640
Great. And also, each child can only see the one right next to them. Is that how it's set up?

282
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,240
There's a few different, I mean, we use the few different versions of this with different ability,

283
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,480
different radius that they can see and so on. All right. Sorry about that. Go for it.

284
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,520
I'll invite you. I love your work, Michael, but here I depart from you. So I invite you to sort of

285
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:23,520
come into my thought line on this. You, of course, know Conway's Game of Life cellular

286
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:30,640
automaton. There's an array of very simple cells, and each cell obeys only essentially one rule.

287
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:39,600
If there are two or three of my neighbors who are alive, then I either stay alive or I become alive.

288
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,760
Otherwise, either I stay dead or I die. That's it. That's all there is. Each cell counts how many

289
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,640
neighbors are alive and decides whether it's alive or dead in the next cycle. That's all there is to

290
00:26:52,640 --> 00:27:00,000
it. And then if you let that thing play out and you see the patterns that the living cells,

291
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,840
the cells that are alive, the patterns they form, we see amazing things. We see cannons firing

292
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:13,200
projectiles. We see systems that seem to be swallowing up other systems and growing as they

293
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,160
do that. That's why it's called the Game of Life, because we see all these patterns. But would you

294
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:25,360
concur with me that, ontically, there is only that simple rule. Everything else is an epistemic

295
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:32,640
projection of us. Yeah, so that's a super interesting and important point. So I do agree

296
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,240
that everything that we just mentioned, the gliders, the beehives, all of this other stuff,

297
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:48,720
it is absolutely a pattern noticed by an observer, in this case us. But my point is going to be that

298
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:56,720
I think the same thing is true of many agents in biology. In other words, I think that observing

299
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:04,640
a temporary physiological object, which is what I think gliders are, right? There are patterns

300
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,280
that move through an excitable medium. I think that in many ways, these kinds of things, this is

301
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:17,840
exactly what, that's a reasonable way to look at life forms, to look at stress patterns moving

302
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:24,080
through tissues, to look at genomic information propagating through a lineage agent. I agree with

303
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:32,720
you, but I think it's actually important. Randy Beard did this cool paper called the cognitive

304
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,800
domain of a glider in the game of life. He literally tried to take the perspective of the

305
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:44,960
glider and say, what do you see from the perspective of the glider? I think it's a projection of

306
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,440
other cognitive systems, and I think that's a great way to look at a lot of things in biology,

307
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,680
actually. I don't have a problem with that. I think complexity science has been showing us

308
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,360
very, very compellingly that things that we consider to be very complex, in fact, aren't

309
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,360
complex at all, at all, ontically. The complexity is our own projection of our own cognitive modes

310
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,480
onto the behavior of that thing. That thing is probably just playing out very simple rules like

311
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:19,680
the game of life. I completely agree with that. As you know, I am an extreme reductionist. It's

312
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,720
just that I don't try to reduce the big to the small. I try to reduce the complex to the simple,

313
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,560
and I think that's the correct way to reduce things. But the title of your paper, in the title

314
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:39,040
of your paper, you start by saying, what do algorithms want? Instead of saying, look, these

315
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,000
high-level functions that we seem to see, they may not be there at all. They may be our own

316
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,120
epistemic projections. The title of your paper suggests that you're doing the opposite. You're

317
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:56,800
imbuing a system made of very simple rules with the kind of cognitive modes that only complex

318
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:06,240
organisms have, like a delayed reward. Well, why do I delay my reward? Because I know, if I have an

319
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:13,280
inner model that gives me a projection of the future state, but that's not what your numbers are

320
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:19,120
doing. They do not have an inner model that allows us to anticipate a possible future state to

321
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,520
deliberately delay their reward. The delayed reward thing is purely an epistemic projection

322
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:32,560
of ours. It's not in the system, but it is in me because I have the model. I experience it. I can

323
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:39,600
anticipate future states and deliberately delay reward for that. That's where I get

324
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:49,440
slightly uncomfortable because you present this not as eliminating the notion that there are these

325
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,120
higher-level cognitive things going on. You present it as if you were imbuing things that

326
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:01,280
are very simple and mechanic with these higher-level cognitive functions. It's just like criticism.

327
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,000
I do it open-heartedly, Michael. Yeah, no, it's great. This is exactly the conversation to have,

328
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,880
and I think these are valid points. Here's my view on it, a couple things. First of all,

329
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:23,680
this idea of epistemic projections, I agree with you, and I think that it's everywhere. In other

330
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:30,960
words, when you look at an embryo, basically for all of these scenarios,

331
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,040
I think there are multiple perspectives, multiple points of view that an observer could take,

332
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,200
and you could absolutely take the bottom perspective, so to speak, and say, okay,

333
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,560
look, in the game of life, there are no gliders. There are no be-haves. All there is is individual

334
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,920
fixed cells. Nothing moves. There are individual fixed cells. It matters, though. What's interesting

335
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:55,040
to me is that these different perspectives, it's often argued that these different perspectives

336
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,240
are a philosophical choice. They're all as good as each other, and you can look at it from the

337
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,640
bottom. You can look at it some other way. I think it actually makes a huge difference, because

338
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,960
I'm sure you've seen somebody made a touring machine in the game of life using the gliders as

339
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:17,840
signal pulses. If you don't believe in gliders, if all you do is, if all you believe in is the

340
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:26,960
low-level rules that govern each cell, you can absolutely explain any events in the world,

341
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,200
in fact, you can predict forward what's going to happen in that world. You can roll it forward as

342
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,360
much as you want. What you're not going to do is build a touring machine out of gliders.

343
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,960
You can make predictions from a system that's already set up. If somebody makes a starting

344
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,600
position, you can certainly say everything that's going to happen about that, but I think that level

345
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,400
of description limits the generative insight that you have into what can happen, and it becomes

346
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,520
really important in the biology that we study. For example, so as you said, there are simple

347
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,080
rules. We look at an embryo. We look at an embryonic blastoderm. There are 50,000 cells,

348
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,840
and somebody will say there is no embryo here. There are just individual chemical reactions.

349
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,960
They're following the rules. There is no embryo here, and certainly there isn't any goal state.

350
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,080
What I would say is this. You can have that view, but what you're going to miss there is the fact

351
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:31,120
that all of the cells in that embryo, the reason that what we're counting, when we say one embryo,

352
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:38,640
what we're counting is the commitment of all of those cells to a particular target in that

353
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,520
anatomical space that they are all going to reach. The reason that I call it a goal and a target is

354
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:49,440
because functionally, if you try to deviate them from that target, you can move things around,

355
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:55,360
you can put barriers, you can do all this stuff. They will find clever ways to still get there.

356
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,200
Now, I'm not saying that this is a metacognitive goal the way that humans have goals and that you

357
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,520
can reason about your goals. You can set new goals. I'm not claiming that. There's a continuum,

358
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:09,920
of course. There's a very basic, there's a very basal version of this, but I think that perspectives

359
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,000
that look at the system and acknowledge that, okay, there's a perspective in which

360
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
none of this is happening. There's another perspective in which that is happening.

361
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,160
It leads you to new experiments. Many of the things that we've done, we've only been able to do

362
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:30,160
precisely because we take seriously the idea that, yes, this is a system that in some way

363
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:36,800
has the ability to correct towards a specific outcome. With respect to these algorithms,

364
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,880
I mean, you're right in that by the way, the paper itself, if you look at the paper itself,

365
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,600
was not titled What Do They Want, right? The paper had a very much more sort of conventional

366
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,080
the blog post is titled that because that's where I sort of say what I think. But

367
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,720
talking to Carl Friston about it, we really talked about the testing and this is an empirical

368
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,080
question. I don't know if this happens or not, but one of the ways you can look at as to why

369
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:12,160
they cluster is the tendency to minimize uncertainty. So your neighbor, the least

370
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,280
uncertain neighbor is the one that's just like you, right? So possibly you can use the active

371
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,560
inference framework to describe why it is that they have a pressure to cluster together with

372
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,800
other beings that are like them. And so this comes up in biology too. So these are all experiments

373
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,560
that we can do. But I would say that I think we're both right in the sense that there is

374
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,560
absolutely a perspective to be taken here in which there are only low level rules,

375
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:46,480
but there are other perspectives on this which may be useful in terms of finding new discoveries,

376
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,080
making new things. And then I guess my final thing is that I think everything is a perspective

377
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:58,480
of some agent, everything, not just some things, but all of it, everything.

378
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,520
I concur with you that it is operationally useful to think at different levels of abstraction.

379
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,800
So if you're going to build a computer, if you're going to build a Turing machine

380
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,880
with the Conways game of life, that it's very useful to operate at a higher level of abstraction,

381
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,480
where you're dealing with higher level components, otherwise you would just be,

382
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,680
you know, overwhelmed with detail. That is operationally useful. But at the end of the day,

383
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,800
it's a cultural game, right? I mean, I am on the record, very publicly,

384
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,880
saying that you are doing the most important work in the world right now. And people have

385
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,400
come to me and say, oh, look, Michael thinks algorithms want stuff. Algorithms have will.

386
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,240
So AI is sentient. And you are saying, you know, on a crusade saying that we have no reason to

387
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,640
think that AI is sentient. And where does that come from? It comes from this epistemic projection

388
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,800
of word usage, how we talk about things. You started your discussion today talking about,

389
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,200
you know, AI people saying, you know, there is nothing to this large language models that we

390
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,160
don't understand. I am one of those people who say that I understand the mechanics of that.

391
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,320
I know what is there and what is not. So the fight we are fighting is to prevent these

392
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,920
operationally useful levels of abstractions. In other words, this convenient fantasies,

393
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,400
which are very, very convenient and should be used. We are trying to prevent people from

394
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,560
understanding this epistemic thing as if it were an actual ontic property of the world out there.

395
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,640
Because that's what Black Mirror does. That's what the eight o'clock news does. That's what

396
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,320
the very suspicious characters on the internet and on YouTube are doing. There is money to be

397
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:54,960
made out of this. Anyway, I have a slight issue with this, but I do understand your point that

398
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:02,000
it is operationally useful. But I think we should try to stress that there is a distinction between

399
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,880
epistemic convenient fictions and ontic things about the world. That's when we say that we are

400
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,720
using an epistemic convenient fiction here. We don't mean by it that the algorithm has a will,

401
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:19,920
that it has the phenomenal state of wanting to get some teleological phenomenal state. We don't

402
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:29,520
necessarily mean that. I'll emphasize the part that we completely agree on. My point about the

403
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,040
language models was not that I think that they have, and I don't use the word sentience much

404
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:41,040
myself, but the kind of sentience that people often attribute to them. I don't think they have it,

405
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:48,080
but I think the kind of the fundamental thing that drives our viewpoints here is that

406
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,240
or the difference in our viewpoints is that I don't really believe in a binary distinction

407
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,480
between yes they have it or no they don't have it. I think it's a deep spectrum, and I think that

408
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,800
what's really interesting and important about the universe is that it's full of what I really

409
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,640
think is sort of competing and acting in the universe is perspectives, frames of reference.

410
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:22,480
I think very simple systems can have a perspective. I think it makes sense. It could be extremely

411
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:30,480
tiny. I don't like the binary trying to classify systems that, okay, this really

412
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,600
has an inner point of view, and this absolutely does not. I think it's a continuum, and I think the

413
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:43,040
question is how much utility do you get from taking the perspective of some other system,

414
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,680
and some of them are truly minimal. These things that we're talking about now, I don't think they're

415
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,240
metacognitive. I don't think they're anything like a human, but I do think that there's a sense of

416
00:39:52,640 --> 00:40:05,120
a nano goal-directedness that we can have, and the problem is that if we don't believe that's

417
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:11,600
true, then we're going to have a real difficulty saying why it is that humans or whatever else

418
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:16,640
did you want to extend it to, why they have it too, because we all start life as a single cell,

419
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,080
and somehow you have to get to the point where you start out as a little blob of chemistry and

420
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:27,280
physics, and eventually you end up with whatever it is that you and I have real metacognitive

421
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,200
wants and goals and things like that. I'm not saying there isn't a difference between those

422
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,640
two cases, there certainly is, but the hard part is explaining that smooth transition,

423
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:43,280
and this is what we work on. Is it okay before you respond? I would love for you to respond.

424
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,440
If one or both of you could state as in simple terms as possible what it is you're debating,

425
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,880
so as many people as possible can follow, because I'm pretty sure I understand, but I don't think

426
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:01,200
I'd be able to articulate it. It's basically what is a thing. What is an emergent property?

427
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,440
I think that that is the discussion. When you talk about emergency in a weak manner, so not

428
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,520
strong emergency, not consciousness out of non-consciousness, just emergence like the shape

429
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,640
of sun dunes or the crystal structure of a snowflake, emergence in that sense in which

430
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:25,280
a system starts with very simple properties, but it seems to develop some very complex properties

431
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:33,680
or some complex behaviors later on. The question is, are emergent behaviors a thing, a non-tic thing

432
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:40,080
in the world out there? Does something actually emerge in the world, or is it just us that project

433
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,760
the modes of our cognition and what's happening? What's happening is just simple stuff. There is

434
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,520
nothing complex emerging. It's just the play out of simple rules in an iterative way, and we project

435
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:58,000
something to it. Michael, we both agreed that there isn't something on-tic going on out there,

436
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,920
if I understood Michael, but Michael says it's useful in our own language, in our own thinking,

437
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,560
in our own inner discourse to pretend that there is, because it allows us to think in a higher

438
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,800
level of abstraction, which is much easier than to continue to operate on first principles

439
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,680
all the way along. It's like somebody asking me to design a risk processor starting from the PN

440
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,360
junctions. It's not useful. I need to think in terms of gates or at least transistors.

441
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,200
Are there transistors in a chip? No. There are only PN and NP junctions. That's all there is to it,

442
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,960
doped silicon and metal. That's all there is to it, but it's useful for me to do my work, to talk

443
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:48,080
of transistors, to talk of gates, to talk of chips and interconnect networks. If I understood

444
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:55,680
Michael, that's where he's coming from, but he also thinks that we shouldn't go too strong in this

445
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:02,160
radical division between emergence being purely epistemic, not being out there in the world and

446
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,960
what is really out there in the world, because he thinks the idea of points of view may be a sort of

447
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:15,680
not a binary one, because if it were binary, we would have difficulty starting from a Zygote,

448
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:23,920
a single cell embryo. Can you even call that an embryo? I think we can. To us who do have a point

449
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,360
of view. How do you explain that transition? I think it was Michael's last point. Is this fair

450
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:35,840
enough, Michael? I think it's reasonable. The second part is straight on. The first part, I

451
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,160
think I want to be a little more radical than this, so let's play it out and see how it goes.

452
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,000
How about this? I 100% agree with you that all of these things, and by the way, it's not just

453
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,200
emergence. I'm not particularly impressed by the emergent complexity per se. I'm interested in

454
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,440
emergent goal-directedness, which is different than just complexity. But I fully agree with you

455
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,600
that all of those things are painted on to the world by us. They are things that we see in the

456
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:09,920
world. Here's the move I want to make. When you say us, I think it's everything. I think that us

457
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,680
is not just us, me and you. I think that every agent in the world, and at some point we could

458
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:23,360
talk about where that bottoms out. But I think certainly what happens in biology is systems

459
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:28,880
that try to understand other systems because they need to hack them. In order to hack them,

460
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:35,680
you don't want to always try to think of them as the lowest level of a bunch of emergent complex

461
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:42,320
chemical soups that are going to happen. If these other systems have any kind of goal-directedness,

462
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,360
and I don't mean human purpose, I mean the kind of things you study in cybernetics, and everything

463
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:52,000
in between. All of these other high-level features, you will paint it on to the world.

464
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,600
This is how you are going to relate to the world. You do not have, as an agent in this universe,

465
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:05,280
you don't have the luxury of being a Laplacian demon and sort of having an unbiased view of the

466
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,160
whole world from the particles up. You have to coarse-grain it and sense-making in a way that

467
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:16,000
makes sense to you, and inevitably you're going to tell agential stories about agents doing things.

468
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:26,080
I think this is universal, and I think that the universe is basically a giant set of competing

469
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:32,240
and cooperating perspectives, and it isn't just us. When we say us, it's everything. It has some

470
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,960
degree of inner perspective on the outside world. If you're a rock, that inner perspective is

471
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:43,440
infinitesimal. We can argue about whether it's zero, but anything above that is going to, and life

472
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:50,000
is very good at scaling up these perspectives and detecting agency and so on, is going to have

473
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,640
these kind of perspectives. That's my move. I think that we really need to get much better at

474
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,880
taking the perspective of other things that are not at all like us, and I think this has also,

475
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,280
of course, social implications and whatever. I think we have a really hard time looking at the

476
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,640
world from the perspective of other things, and I've been spending a lot of time in the last

477
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:17,600
few weeks really thinking about this and thinking of tools to help us take the perspective of other

478
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:26,400
systems. I'll try to amplify the problem you describe, and I will at least try to convince

479
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,000
you that I understand the problem, and then I'll try to articulate why, based on my own views,

480
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:39,760
the problem isn't there. The problem you see is we start as a single cell zygote,

481
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:47,680
which is very simple. Well, relatively speaking, because zygote, the biochemical machinery of

482
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,960
that thing is unpathemable. Nobody has figured out, nobody has a model of that down to first

483
00:46:52,960 --> 00:47:00,080
principles, but okay, relatively simple, and then it becomes us, and we do have a point of view.

484
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:08,080
Now, the same problem is playing out in physics. The measurement problem says that physical things

485
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:14,960
only have existence in relation to an observing system, but what constitutes an observing system?

486
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,920
Well, anything constitutes an observing system, so anything may have a point of view.

487
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:31,200
I think both attempts to solve this problem are based on the following intuition. When it all

488
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,000
starts, there is no point of view, and then suddenly there is a point of view, and this

489
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,720
discontinuity is a problem. There is only two ways to solve it. Either everything has a point of

490
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:50,480
view from the get go, or you didn't start without a point of view. That's one possibility.

491
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,360
It's the assumption that the zygote does not have a point of view, and a point of view then

492
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:02,960
develops with growth that leads to the problem. It is the assumption that

493
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:13,520
any physical system is analogous to any other physical system, as far as the measurement

494
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:19,760
problem is concerned, that forces us to say anything is an observer, because we don't have

495
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:26,720
a well-behaved objective criterion to say, no, no, this is a valid observing system, and that is not,

496
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:33,760
or this is a thing, and that is not. It's a projection. It's an arbitrary way of us carving

497
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:40,720
out the world. It is not a thing, or to say the zygote doesn't have a point of view, but a grown

498
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:49,680
human has. Under my own view, a zygote already has a point of view, because a point of view

499
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,600
is what arises from dissociation. If there is a dissociative process, that dissociation creates

500
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:02,480
a point of view. It creates the observer, so to say, which is distinct from the world, and therefore

501
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,520
can observe, because it is dissociated from the world. Otherwise, it's just the world.

502
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,920
Then in philosophy, this question goes deeper. It's not only what has a point of view, which

503
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,520
under analytic idealism is only living things, as zygote is living. It developed a point of view,

504
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:25,360
the moment of accumulation. But in philosophy, it goes deeper. What constitutes a thing?

505
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:33,360
Is a painting hanging from your wall a thing? Is your table a thing? If so, are each of the

506
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:39,920
four feet of the table four things? But isn't the table then just one thing, or is it five things?

507
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:46,960
Is it the top of the table and the four feet? There is difficulty in even determining what a

508
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:53,520
thing is, let alone what properties it has. Can it observe? Does it have a point of view?

509
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:59,600
Does it have a will of itself? I mean, even before we get to that, asking whether a table

510
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:04,160
has a point of view, whether a table has volition, we have to ask, is the table a thing,

511
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:12,640
or are we just projecting the epistemic structure of our language onto the ontology of the world?

512
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,800
Not everything we have a distinct word for is a thing. This is a fist, we have a word for it.

513
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:25,440
Boom, it has disappeared. Where is the fist? The laws of conservation of energy have just been

514
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:31,680
violated because something has disappeared without releasing energy. How is that possible? You run

515
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:40,880
into this kind of problems. The moment we are not careful about paying attention, about mistaking

516
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,480
the structure of language for the ontological structure of the world, which we are very prone

517
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:51,520
to doing because we are surrounded by language. We live in a world of language. So to me,

518
00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:01,440
what you are trying to do, and you are probably a pioneer in this in biology, but

519
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,600
you're not a pioneer of this in science in general because physics has been struggling

520
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,640
with this for a while, philosophy has been struggling with this for a while.

521
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,640
The difficulty you are having is that you do not have a clear objective criterion to determine

522
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:22,720
what is a thing as far as a certain definition of thinness that is concerned. And because you

523
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,880
don't have that, then everything has to be a thing. Therefore, everything has to have a point

524
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:32,080
of view in potential, or not if it's too simple like this I got, then it doesn't have one, but we

525
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:41,360
do. So what magic happens in the middle? To me, pecundation, the moment zero, t zero of life,

526
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,600
is what determines a thing. Why do I say that? Is it arbitrary? No, it's because unlike the question

527
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,960
of whether the feet of a table are real things for which there is no ontological criteria,

528
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:00,480
all criteria are epistemic. They are based on convenience. If that thing breaks, I need to

529
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:06,640
have a word to refer to it so I can repair and put another foot on my table. But there is one

530
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:14,880
exception to this. If you avoid applying epistemic criteria to carving out the world into things,

531
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:20,000
there are no things. There is no car. If you say, well, a car is everything that is needed for the

532
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,640
thing to move. Well, it needs the air for the combustion. Without the air, it doesn't move.

533
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:29,840
It needs the road for the tires to grip. Without the road, it doesn't move. It needs gravity to

534
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:36,240
pull it to the road. Without gravity, it doesn't move. So if you follow that criteria, this kind

535
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,760
of criteria, functionality criteria, which is how it's called in philosophy, then the whole

536
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:48,240
universe is a thing. There is even a naming philosophy for the blob theory, whatever. But there

537
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,520
is one exception to this. There is one thing for which we have objective criteria to say,

538
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:59,040
these are things. And that's life. Because if you stick a needle on the arm of my chair,

539
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:06,000
I don't feel it. But if you stick it on my arm, I do feel it. So there is a clear boundary between

540
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,160
what I do register and what I don't register. That boundary determines me as a real thing,

541
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:18,160
not as just a sort of an arbitrary collection of pixels on the screen of perception that we give

542
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:26,000
a name to. It's like saying, take the Mona Lisa and group all the pixels or all the infinitesimal

543
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,400
dots of pigment that are around yellow, given a certain tolerance. And you call that a thing.

544
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:39,280
That's what we do, this kind of arbitrary grouping of the pixels of reality. But when it comes to life,

545
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:45,360
it's not. And we know that firsthand, we know where the limits of our thinness are.

546
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:53,280
Should the wall, nothing happens. Should the head of something very dramatic happens in my inner life.

547
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:01,760
So to me, that zygote already has a point of view, because that's what life is.

548
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:09,440
Life is when life is formed, what we call the rise of life is the rise of a point of view,

549
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:15,520
because it's the image of a dissociative process. And then adult human is that zygote still.

550
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:24,880
It's not another system that zygote didn't get together with trillions of other cells

551
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:30,960
that pile up on top of each other to form us. That's not the history of us. That zygote underwent

552
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:38,400
mitosis, cell division. And here we are already passing a sort of metaphysical judgment by talking

553
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:46,080
about cell division. What's happening if you look at it neutrally, that zygote is inner complexifying.

554
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:52,640
It's creating inner structure. And because it only knows how to be a cell, that's how it started,

555
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:58,960
then that inner structure is a sort of an iterative, self-similar fractal complexification.

556
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,680
It creates structure by adding more of the only thing it knows how to be.

557
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:10,320
So that's why it started with a point of view and has a point of view. Now it's the same thing.

558
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:15,600
I am the zygote that was in the womb of my mother. It's just that that zygote

559
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:21,120
complexified, created inner structure fractally by repeating the template. The only template it knew

560
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:28,160
how to be. This wouldn't be correct if the way human beings came to being

561
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:35,200
were by a trillion cells crawling and piling on top of each other to form us. It doesn't happen like

562
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:45,920
this. Sorry, I was passionate about this. My admiration for you forces me to be more polite.

563
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:51,920
I hope you didn't take it as an attack. It's not. But this is something I feel passionate about.

564
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,840
Of course. No, no. This is great. And Amir, you can tell us when it's time to move on to a different

565
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:01,760
topic because I think we could talk about this for a really long time. But I would just say a

566
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:07,040
couple of things. I agree with you that the zygote already has a perspective. I agree with that.

567
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:18,320
I also think that this business of whether something is a thing or not, I don't like the

568
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:24,560
binary framing of it. I don't think we need a binary classification. I think what's more

569
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:31,280
interesting than that are the ability of various perspectives to recognize persistent patterns.

570
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:41,120
Somebody with a very long life span of millions of years would look at each of us as a temporary

571
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:45,840
metabolic blip. It's a pattern. It's like a wave that showed up and it's gone. There's no

572
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:52,960
permanence in anything in our bodies. And the other thing I would say is that the time zero

573
00:56:53,520 --> 00:57:00,160
the fertilization event, I really don't take it as seriously as you do because I visualize what's

574
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,840
happening there. So what's happening there is that you have an unfertilized OSI. We can see

575
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:10,720
how it got there. So the steps. So what you have is a bunch of nerve cells that basically create

576
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:16,080
a new cell and they sort of shove it full of useful materials that it's going to have later on.

577
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:21,840
And there it is. So it starts out as a bunch of chemical processes. And then at some point,

578
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:29,040
the sperm shows up. I mean, it's cool and all, but you can duplicate that with a poke of a needle

579
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:33,040
actually in many organisms. You can do it without the sperm. You can just sort of poke them with

580
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,840
the needle and they undergo parthenogenesis and they start to various things. Some calcium comes

581
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:43,360
in and the membrane becomes impermeable to new sperm. And then some more chemical reactions

582
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:50,560
happen. I'm just not sure there's anything fundamentally profound that happens at fertilization

583
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:57,680
per se. And I think we could, I can imagine in not too far future, all of those early processes

584
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:02,640
being done exactly, as you said before, by an aggregation kind of phenomenon, right? We could

585
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:08,720
replace those nerve cells with little microfluidic pumps that create the thing and then kick

586
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:14,480
started with a needle and so on. I think the whole thing is much more continuous. And it's

587
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:19,920
about a transit. What I see when I look at biology and when I look at the world, what I see is a

588
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,720
constant transformation, meaning growing and shrinking and a reshuffling of perspectives.

589
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,640
I see cognitive light cones that can be very large. They can be very small. They're all looking at

590
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:33,440
each other. They're all making estimates about where the other beings are and what the sort of

591
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:43,200
cognitive capacity of these beings are. And I'm just not seeing any binary categories for us

592
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,720
or for thingness or for anything else. I think there are just perspectives.

593
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:52,160
I'll briefly comment on this. I mean, I think we are sort of beginning to converge or at least

594
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:58,640
identifying where we don't agree, but very briefly, just to prevent a misunderstanding.

595
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:06,400
I don't think facundation is the rise of a point of view from no points of view.

596
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:15,280
Facundation is two points of view creating a third. So it's from points of view to a different

597
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,040
point of view. So it's not a fundamental transition. You're not creating something

598
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:24,640
that's fundamentally new. It already started with two previous points of view,

599
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:30,640
but those two previous points of views mixed in a certain way and outcomes a different point of view.

600
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:41,120
What I think is trickier, and maybe you agree with me, is that it's a biogenesis.

601
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:47,120
The rise of life from non-life is when you truly create a point of view from things that were

602
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:51,520
not a point of view. That is a little trickier. Otherwise, we would have done it already. You

603
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,880
would have done it already. Craig Venter would have done it already, but all he managed to do

604
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:05,120
was to synthesize DNA and implant it on a sort of empty shell that was alive. It started from life.

605
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:10,720
So there seems to be something... If you ask me, do I think we will artificially be able

606
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:16,960
to induce a biogenesis? I think we will. I don't see any fundamental reason for us not to be able

607
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:23,040
to do that, because obviously it has happened at least once in the universe. So if it has happened,

608
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:28,720
it can happen. And if it can happen, maybe it would take the monkeys another 500 years, but I

609
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:34,560
don't see any fundamental reason why the monkeys won't be able to do that. But it is on a different

610
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:42,240
level and level of complexity than fecundation, I think. Otherwise, we would have done it already.

611
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,440
What do we say, Amir? Should we more of that or go on to something else?

612
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:58,400
I mean, someone put in the comments, I think it's such an important topic. It's my favorite one.

613
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,000
I don't want to bias the whole group, but several people put little emoticons on that.

614
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:10,880
So this is kind of fundamental to who we are and what we are conscious of. I don't think there's

615
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:15,600
a more important topic they're able to put in the chat and everyone who thinks, no, we really need

616
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,960
to discuss this, put lots of emoticons on it, and then we'll see, okay, there's something

617
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:26,240
people feel we urgently need to discuss. The only thing I'm nervous about in terms of the group is

618
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:35,280
I'm following it, but mainly thanks to having, you know, watched a lot of your stuff, Michael,

619
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:43,440
and also being invested in this for a little bit. So I just wonder if it was like a short recap,

620
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:51,360
if that's possible, and then the kind of chat to the TV version of like, okay,

621
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:55,840
some of this debate in a paragraph in simple terms, I think that's possible for you.

622
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:02,960
Yeah, yeah, that's going to be tough. I think it's because we're talking about a number of really,

623
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:09,040
really deep issues here. I mean, one thing I think that we're discussing is whether there are

624
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,360
binary categories for some of the interesting things that we talk about, for example, living

625
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:18,000
or not living. Now, this may be crazy for biologists to say, but I don't actually believe that's a

626
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:25,200
distinction. So I think it's a spectrum. I don't believe that, you know, you can say something

627
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:34,320
is life or not life. I think what you can say is to what degree is something good at scaling the

628
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:41,600
cognitive light cone of its parts. I think we call things alive, where the system itself has a larger

629
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:46,320
and a more interesting cognitive light cone than all of its parts have, you know, so rocks don't

630
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,520
do that, right? So little particles have a very tiny, I don't think it's zero, but I think it's

631
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:57,680
extremely tiny cognitive light cone and the rock has exactly the same. But living things are actually

632
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:04,160
very good at scaling these perspectives and climbing up that cognitive hierarchy. But to me,

633
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:11,280
it's a continuum. And I think that, you know, I think that the creation of life from scratch,

634
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:17,520
as you know, the biogenesis that Bernardo was talking about, I think we are, as you say, I think

635
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,200
we're going to get there. I don't think, I don't think there are, I think it's a technological

636
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:26,160
issue that's stopping us now. It's not a knowledge issue. It's not a kind of a, you know, a fundamental

637
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,960
thing. But anyway, I think I think we're talking about that, whether there are these binary

638
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:36,960
categories. And I think we're also talking about whether there are objective facts about the,

639
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:44,240
about, you know, what a thing is or whether something is an agent or is not. And so whether

640
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:49,520
that's the case or whether everything is a matter of a perspective from some kind of system, you

641
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:54,160
know, is it super helpful to take the perspective of a table? I think not. I think you don't end up

642
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:59,840
with much. But I do think that there are systems that we can build that might be biological,

643
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:04,560
that might be technological, that might be hybrid. So we make hybrids, which have a little bit of

644
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:10,320
biology, but otherwise they're basically an engineered system. And to really understand,

645
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,760
to relate to that system, to understand what it's doing, what it's capable of,

646
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,720
at some cases, to have ethical relationships with it, I think you do need to take its perspective,

647
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:28,720
not as a technique or a, you know, a bit of fakery that you indulge in to help the science go,

648
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:34,480
but actually fundamentally, you know, I really do believe that all kinds of things have perspectives

649
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:39,680
that we currently do not recognize. I don't think we're very good at recognizing the perspective

650
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:44,640
of unconventional systems that are not like us. And I think they're real in the sense that

651
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:49,120
anything is real. And I mean, I share, you know, basic, you know, kind of these idealist,

652
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:55,680
you know, kind of basic ideas with Bernardo, but I think there are way more perspectives

653
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:01,840
in the universe than we think, you know. Do you associate life with the Borell and

654
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:08,640
Autopolyasis? I think, I think it's, so what I think is auto-police is very important for,

655
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:13,360
is the creation of a mind, not life. I think, I think cognitive, I'm much more interested in the

656
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:20,080
cognitive kind of distinctions than life or not life. I don't think, I think we can absolutely

657
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:26,720
make things that would engage in some degree of auto-police is that, that some people wouldn't

658
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:30,080
call alive, I guess. I don't even know, I don't have a good definition for life. You could,

659
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:33,760
you know, you could bring on Sarah Walker or somebody who really thinks about life, per se,

660
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,960
and she would have a different opinion, I think. I don't spend much time thinking about life at

661
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:45,120
all. But I do think that auto-police is a critical component of making a mind with a

662
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:50,480
significant inner perspective. If you're not auto-poetic, you're going to have an extremely

663
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:57,760
small inner perspective. When you say that non-living things may have perspectives,

664
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,720
do you mean that there is something that is like to be them, that they are conscious in their own

665
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,880
right, in their own, given the boundaries of their own system?

666
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,880
So this is, you know, the what's it like to be is an interesting question, because look, if you say,

667
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,320
let's go back to the kind of original, you know, what's it like to be a bat, right?

668
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:20,160
So what are we really asking there? If you ask that question, what's it like to be some kind of a

669
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:28,240
system? If you, what I think you're really talking about is a relationship between two things. In

670
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:33,360
other words, if I really knew what it was like to be a bat, there would just be one more bat.

671
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:37,280
Okay, I wouldn't be finding out what it's like to be a bat. If I really, really knew everything

672
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,720
about what it was to be a bat, I would just be a bat. And that's it. There'd be one more bat,

673
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:46,080
and I wouldn't learn a darn thing. There'd be a bat. So what we're really talking about is some

674
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:54,160
kind of a, I view it as some kind of a control knob, where what you're really saying is I'm going

675
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:59,440
to retain some features of myself, but I'm going to twist this knob a little bit so that some other

676
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,720
things are going to change, I'll become more bat like, and then I'm going to know what it's like

677
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,080
to some extent to be like this other creature. I don't think, you know, if you go all the way,

678
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:13,760
then you then you're just whatever it is. So, so I think it's a I think that question is actually

679
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:21,520
much harder than, than a lot of people make it out to be. But, but yes, I do think that some

680
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:26,640
things that currently people would not classify as living. And I don't know, I mean, people, like,

681
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:31,440
if you look at a textbook that kids use, they use all kinds of criteria, you know, what has to be

682
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,320
subject to the laws of evolution, and it has to have metabolism and, you know, some other stuff,

683
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:41,360
right? So there may be some criteria like that. Yeah, I think that I think that there can be,

684
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:45,840
and probably are both here and outer, you know, sort of wider in the universe,

685
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:52,080
things that would fail those criteria, and that do have a useful inner perspective from which to

686
01:07:52,080 --> 01:08:00,800
see the universe. Do you think viruses have a conscious perspective? So, so, so I reject the

687
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:07,520
do they or don't they kind of thing, right? Because I will not try to put it in a category,

688
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:12,880
I will simply ask the question, if you try to view the world from the perspective of a virus,

689
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,160
what do you see? And I think you see very little. I don't think you see zero, but I think you see

690
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:22,400
very little. And so, and so that's what we're talking about. I think all of this is about

691
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:27,360
what is the, what is the cognitive like cone? And this is by the way an experimental, I mean,

692
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:32,480
people, people said this about, about cells and tissues, they say, oh, that's zero. And I'm saying,

693
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:36,080
no, you need to do experiments. And if you do experiments, you might find that there actually

694
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:42,240
is a very useful inner perspective that you can try to at least get your head around you,

695
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:45,280
you're never going to be it, you're never going to be that system, but you're going to at least try.

696
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:51,680
So, you know, yes, do I think they have some degree of inner perspective? Yes,

697
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:55,680
is it, is it, is it significant? I think it's extremely small.

698
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:03,360
If you look at integrated information theory, they are flexible about what where the boundaries

699
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:09,360
are. I mean, flexible, the theory implies where the boundaries are, but that doesn't necessarily

700
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:15,360
line up with life, at least not in principle, not a priori, maybe in practice, it may line up with

701
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:22,880
life. And as far as we know, it does, but not, not a priori. But the theory does say, even if we

702
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,480
don't know where the boundaries are, because we don't have the instrumentation to make the measurements

703
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:32,480
that are needed for us to derive that conclusion, there are boundaries, because of the exclusion

704
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:41,920
principle in IIT. So, whatever, whatever states become part of a complex, their perspective

705
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:49,520
becomes subsumed in the perspective of the entire complex. In other words, the states that form

706
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:56,560
a complex do not have a perspective of their own. That's the integrated information part of the theory.

707
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:03,600
Do you disagree with that? Do you think there aren't such criteria for determining what is

708
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:09,200
subsumed and what is not? What I don't, well, a couple of things, again, and I mean, you know,

709
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:14,880
I don't believe that there are objective criteria for any of this. I think all of these criteria

710
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,840
are from the perspective of some observer, which in the case of significant systems like living

711
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:25,920
systems, is the system itself. Okay. What I don't like, I mean, IIT, what I, the one thing I don't

712
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,640
like about it is that exclusion axiom, right? I mean, it's basically something that's just sort

713
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:35,360
of added on with my understanding of it anyways, that it's just added on. I don't like it because

714
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:44,640
I do think that even in the human organisms, there are multiple, there are multiple selves,

715
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,640
multiple perspectives of different degrees of sophistication. I mean, it's awesome that we

716
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:54,720
have these left hemispheres that can talk to each other and verbally and make claims about

717
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,360
how conscious they are and how they don't think the liver is conscious. And, you know, I mean,

718
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:03,040
after all, I don't feel the liver being conscious, right? And that's great. But

719
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:09,680
that's because, I think that's because, and I don't say much about consciousness usually, but

720
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:15,280
just this kind of role with it here. I think that's because we have a very hard time taking

721
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:20,800
the perspective of other beings in other problem spaces. So I do think that, for example, the

722
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:26,480
liver, let's just take that. I think the liver is an intelligent agent that navigates physiological

723
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:32,560
state space. It's a space that we have a very hard time visualizing. Our sense organs did not

724
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:38,000
train us to navigate that, to see that space. We're bad at recognizing things that work at

725
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:44,160
other timescales and other spaces. And I think that if we did, if we were better at directly,

726
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:49,920
just imagine like, here's how you might engineer a being that could do this. Imagine a human that

727
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:54,320
was born with an innate sense of their blood chemistry, right? The way that you feel and see,

728
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,760
and whatever, you also had some receptors for, I don't know, 20 different parameters of your

729
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:02,400
blood chemistry, and you could feel it directly. I think if we had that, if we had, if we were

730
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:09,840
that kind of creature, I think we had no problem recognizing that our liver is an agent with some

731
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,160
degree of intelligence, navigating that space, dealing with all kinds of stuff that happens,

732
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:18,000
not just because it's complex, it's not an issue of complexity, it's an issue of problem solving,

733
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,720
it's an issue of having preferences. Your liver absolutely has preferences about which

734
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:26,480
kinds of blood chemistry it likes better than others and how it feels about certain things you

735
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:33,600
drink and stuff like that. And I think that if we were better at recognizing these things,

736
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:40,000
we would A, be able to notice it, B, we would be able to communicate with it better. I mean,

737
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,760
this is our research program now, is literally trying to communicate with these things, not

738
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:48,240
micromanage them, not force them, but to improve the biomedicine of drug use and regeneration

739
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:55,600
and so on. When I say drug, I mean pharmacology, to use these things as a way of getting buy-in

740
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,920
from the tissues, I mean, literally getting the tissues to not fight back and not to cause all

741
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:05,600
these issues with all these different reasons that drugs fail and so on, but to actually

742
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:12,800
communicate with that primitive intelligence. And yeah, I think, and of course, we don't feel

743
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,840
it to be conscious because we don't feel each other to be conscious either, right?

744
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,520
You know, that's anyway, that's my take on it.

745
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:25,280
The IIT is consistent with what you said. IIT does not say that there is only one

746
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:32,720
complex in a living creature. What it says is that whatever is part of a complex,

747
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:37,760
then the only point of view is that of the complex. The subparts do not have their own

748
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:42,480
point of view. Their own point of view becomes subsumed in the global point of view of the

749
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:49,840
complex. There are many complexities in a living being and one of them could entail the liver.

750
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:56,240
This is completely consistent with IIT and even with analytic idealism because the liver is part

751
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:02,480
of a living body. So to me, it's perfectly okay to talk about, you know, the multiple

752
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:07,040
complexities that form us. And there is even a lot of empirical evidence for this, you know,

753
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,960
that there has been this back and forth about what happens to consciousness when you sever

754
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:16,560
the corpus callosum. Initially they said, well, consciousness splits in two and then they talk

755
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,840
to the patient and the patient said, nothing changed. And then they decided, okay, it didn't

756
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:28,080
split in two. But now with modern experiments, we are seeing that in fact they have split in two.

757
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:34,880
It's just that each consciousness of the two does not notice a difference because it's

758
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:40,480
dissociated from the other and doesn't know about the presence of the other. But people behave as

759
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:51,600
do. You can ask people two different questions and depending on whether the answer comes verbally

760
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:59,120
or from writing, the answer is different because it's the left hemisphere controlling language.

761
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:04,960
And if you're writing with your left hand, then it's the right hemisphere controlling that. And

762
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:10,800
the answers are different, which is amazing. Amazing. If you confront people with this,

763
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:17,440
they will confabulate a completely implausible story for why they did that. And they will insist

764
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:24,320
that, oh, nothing changed. I am still me. So all of this is consistent. IIT does not contradict

765
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:33,040
what you said. I would even, if I may make a suggestion, Michael, I think a collaboration

766
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:37,040
between you and Julia could lead to some very interesting things.

767
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:41,360
Yeah, I agree. Yeah, and Julia and I have talked about these kind of things. We are using some of

768
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:50,080
those techniques to look for not really Phi, but various surrogate metrics of Phi in the various

769
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:54,960
things. Like for example, in this scenario where we do have cells that come together to become a

770
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,520
xenobot or to, you know, we have other kinds of systems where cells come together, like to

771
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,360
literally watch, right? Can we look at by tracking calcium signaling and other things?

772
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:08,960
Can we actually watch the integration happening? Yeah, I agree with you. I think that's super

773
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:15,680
interesting. There's another thing here that I think might end up being very relevant to this,

774
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:21,680
which is something else that I've been thinking about a lot recently, having to do with memory.

775
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:27,760
And the way that, and this is related to this issue of perspectives,

776
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:35,840
and one way, so let's just go back to the basic example that I bring up a lot, which is you got

777
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:41,520
a caterpillar, you train the caterpillar to eat some leaves on a particular color disc,

778
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:45,840
and it remembers, and so on. And then that caterpillar becomes a butterfly. So in the

779
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,840
process of becoming a butterfly, basically most of its brain is dissolved, most of the

780
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,760
connections are broken, it rebuilds a new brain, now you got this butterfly, and the butterfly

781
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:58,640
still recalls the original information. So one thing that you might think about is, wow,

782
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,600
where is the information stored during this process? And that's an interesting question,

783
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,640
but there's actually a much more interesting issue here, which is that keeping information still,

784
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:14,080
meaning recording it and making sure it doesn't change, is a minor part of this, the more major

785
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:19,200
part of this, is the fact that the butterfly and the caterpillar are completely different

786
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:24,160
architectures. So first of all, the butterfly does not eat what the caterpillar eats. So the

787
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:28,160
butterfly doesn't care about the leaves at all. And what you actually have to do, the caterpillar

788
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:32,720
lives in the two-dimensional world, it crawls around, the butterfly lives in this three-dimensional

789
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:42,160
world. So what you really have here is the ability for information to get remapped in a way that,

790
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:46,320
in your new life, as literally, I mean, this is going to sound crazy, but literally, this is all

791
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:52,400
literally true. In your new life as a higher-dimensional being, what you're going to remember is not the

792
01:17:52,400 --> 01:18:00,320
details of the things you learned before, but the salient meaning, the part of that, the lessons

793
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:04,880
that you learned that are actually relevant to your new life, and they're going to get remapped

794
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:10,080
onto a completely different set of muscles and different behavioral repertoires in a butterfly

795
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:17,120
than existed in the caterpillar. So this issue of remapping information and the importance of,

796
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:21,520
from the perspective of, right, so you've got, I mean, of course, it's going to have some kind of

797
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:27,840
medium, some kind of engram that holds the information. What you have to ask is then,

798
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,400
from the perspective of whom, what does that information mean? So from the perspective of

799
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:37,600
the caterpillar, it might mean, you know, crawl in a certain way and get yourself some leaves

800
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,640
from a perspective, the butterfly, it means, I don't know, flap your wings a different way and

801
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:46,560
you're going to get some nectar, but they're reinterpreting this information from different

802
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:53,600
perspectives. And I think once you start thinking about this importance of remapping information

803
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:58,240
to new contexts, some very interesting things happen. For example, if we think about the

804
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:05,200
evolutionary lineage as a whole organism, right, so I don't know, some 50 million years of

805
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:12,320
alligators or something. So like the whole lineage, what you know for a fact, if you're

806
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:16,800
that lineage, what you know for a fact is that everything is going to change. Your body is going

807
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,160
to change because there will be mutations, your cells are going to change because there will be

808
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:28,640
different chemical, you know, properties in your environment. If you try to take the information

809
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:33,280
you learned in your past too seriously, if you sort of over train on those priors, you know it's

810
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:40,400
going to be poorly applicable in the future. What I think evolution does, I think it fundamentally

811
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:46,080
makes, because everything is change and everything is guaranteed to be different, what I think it

812
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:52,400
fundamentally does is mechanisms that are perspectives that are trying to extract salience

813
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:59,200
from my current situation, from whatever you were inherited, whatever you inherited from

814
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:04,480
the previous times. This is why biology is so incredibly interoperable that we can, you know,

815
01:20:04,480 --> 01:20:07,920
we can take the cells out and put them, you know, we can, I didn't even get to talk about

816
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:13,280
Anthrobots yet, which is this whole new thing that we published recently. You can take the

817
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:18,320
cells out, combine them with some kind of weird nanomaterial that they've never seen before and

818
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:24,560
always something useful and something coherent happens. And it's because I think fundamentally

819
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:32,800
life and evolution have bought into the assumption that things are not going to be the same,

820
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:38,560
that you're going to have to re, you're going to have to reinterpret and remap what you have

821
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:45,360
from a different perspective. And you can think about this as, you know, we, I mean, we're not

822
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:50,320
butterfly caterpillars, but we kind of have this too, you know, when we were children, we had

823
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:53,760
certain memories and certain things were very important and other things were less important.

824
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,360
And then, you know, puberty kicks in and all kinds of stuff happens. Your brain is remodeled

825
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:03,360
by the hormones and whatever. And you have to now, you know, you still have those memories,

826
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,920
they make some sort of sense to you. And in fact, each memory recall we know now is not a

827
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:14,240
non-destructive read, right? Every instance of recall actually modifies the memory a little bit.

828
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:21,440
And so this, so I think this is just really important, the ability of, I think that's another

829
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:24,560
thing that's special, right? So auto poesis is one, but the other thing that's special

830
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:30,240
about what things that we call living is that they're just very good at

831
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:41,040
compressing down the complex states of an organism, a time t, compressing it down to an arrow,

832
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,880
you know, kind of almost like the, you know, the middle node of an auto encoder or something,

833
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:49,520
right? You shrunk it down, and then you're going to reinflate it, but you might reinflate it onto

834
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,760
a completely different context. You're not going to be the same as you were before, right? And

835
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:59,520
none of us are the same. And you can see that in evolution, where you shrink it down, every

836
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:07,040
generation shrinks it down to an egg, reinflates down to an egg, reinflates. And we can, communication

837
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:10,960
is that way too, right? So I have a complicated brain state here. If I give you a matrix of all

838
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:15,840
my neuronal states at this time, there's nothing you can do with it because your brain is somewhat

839
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:20,160
of a different structure, even if we're the same species, you can't map it exactly. But language

840
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:24,640
gives us a nice narrow interface, right? Where I can take all of that, I can squeeze it down to

841
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:28,400
a message, I give you the message, you're going to reinflate it in your own cognitive system,

842
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:33,760
however, however you can, you know, it may, it may end up the same as, as, as how I sent or may,

843
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,920
it may not, but you will preserve the salience, right? You're going to squeeze the salience out

844
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:44,320
of it. And so that's what I think is really important about, about memory as message passing

845
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:50,880
between temporal slices of beings and that having a perspective from which you interpret

846
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:55,600
your engrams, your environment, everything else. Yeah, I think, I think that's really key.

847
01:22:56,160 --> 01:23:01,120
I can't remember what we agreed, Michael, you're staying two and a half hours or two hours or

848
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:05,280
how much time do we have you for? I got another half hour, no problem.

849
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:11,280
So I think this crowd, especially in me, would be interested in your thoughts on,

850
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:17,200
you've hinted at a platonic realm, it's speculative, has some utility in explaining

851
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:22,400
some things in evolution, if I've understood you correctly. Are you comfortable in bringing

852
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:28,080
the conversation in that direction for a bit? Sure, yeah. And this is, you know, just to be

853
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:35,920
clear, this is right at the edge of things that I feel certain about. So I'm just going to kind of

854
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:38,800
say some stuff that I've been thinking and I have no idea if this is going to,

855
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:44,960
in the end, be useful or mature properly or what. So just some thoughts.

856
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:53,920
The way I got into it was through the creation of the various synthetic

857
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:58,560
kinds of life forms that we make. So we make xenobots. The more recent thing I'll just tell

858
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:05,920
you about is anthrobots. So when we made, so xenobots are self-assembling little proto-organisms

859
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:12,160
that come together. When we scrape some skin cells off of early frog embryos, they can come

860
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:17,440
together and have all kinds of interesting behaviors and so on. And there's a bunch of

861
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:21,840
new stuff that isn't published yet about new genes that these guys express that

862
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:26,640
frog embryos don't express and so on. But one of the things that you might think when you see that

863
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:32,160
and you say, well, amphibians, we know amphibians are plastic. We know that embryos are very plastic.

864
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:35,920
Maybe this is a frog embryonic thing. Maybe this is just specific to frog embryos.

865
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:41,360
And so what we wanted to do was to get as far away from that as possible. And so

866
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:46,080
what's far away from embryonic frogs? Well, that would be adult humans.

867
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:52,960
And so this is a project by PhD students who just defended Gizem Gomushkaya in my group.

868
01:24:53,600 --> 01:25:00,080
And what we did was we took tracheal epithelial cells from adult human patients. So no embryonic,

869
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:04,960
you know, no human embryos, but adult patients, they donate these tracheal epithelial cells.

870
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:14,640
And what we found was a protocol in which these cells are given a second life. They basically

871
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:22,320
grow into, again, a kind of self-multi-little organism. If I had, well, you can see this on,

872
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,360
there's a blog post about it. You can see the little video, this thing running around.

873
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:33,280
And so they have, again, they have a different morphology than the normal humans or human

874
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:39,920
embryos. They have different gene expression. They have some interesting abilities. One thing

875
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:46,960
that we found is that when they encounter a scratch in a bunch of human peripheral neurons,

876
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,720
they will actually heal that scratch. This is not in patients yet. This is in the petri dish.

877
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:56,640
But if you make a damage to a lawn of neurons, the antherbots, we can sit down there and over

878
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:00,480
about four days, they sort of knit the two sides together and repair the damage. Who would have

879
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:04,960
thought that your tracheal cells, which normally sit there quietly for decades in your lung epithelium,

880
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:09,360
have the ability to run around and heal neural wounds when given the opportunity. So you get

881
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:20,400
these emergent novel capabilities, novel structures, and we're just scratching the surface

882
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,920
we don't know, I think, even a tiny bit of what they can do. But once you start thinking about

883
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:30,080
where do these competencies come from, typically speaking, if you look at any kind of an animal

884
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:37,120
or plant, you say, okay, so why does it have certain shapes and certain behaviors?

885
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:41,360
The typical answer is, well, evolution, of course, eons of selection. So it was selected.

886
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:47,360
The frog genome knows how to make frogs because that is what it was selected for,

887
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:53,120
success in a froggy environment. But here you get to, and certainly our data are not the only

888
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:57,440
ones, there are other data like this, you get to a scenario where you've got these things,

889
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:01,680
well, there was no history of antherbots. There was never selective pressure for your

890
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:05,440
tracheal epithelial cells to be able to run around on their own and heal neural wounds.

891
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:13,760
There were no xenobots. Xenobots are able to construct other xenobots by running around and

892
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,400
collecting together loose skin cells that we give them, as we call it, kinematic self-replication.

893
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:23,920
There's never been any xenobots. There's never been selection to no other animal on earth,

894
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:28,240
as far as anybody knows, reproduces like this. Where do these capacities come from?

895
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:33,680
So you can start to think that maybe what's happening, and obviously I'm not the first

896
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:40,240
person to think this, so a lot of classic philosophy thought about this idea that there is

897
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:47,840
some sort of latent space or a platonic space in which certain kinds of, I don't even know what

898
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:55,040
to call them, I'm not going to call them objects, but certain kind of things hang out there.

899
01:27:55,040 --> 01:28:00,640
And these things become instantiated, they become implemented in the real world when

900
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:07,120
physical machines show up that are good embodiments for them. So for example, when

901
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:15,120
evolution discovers different ion channels that are voltage sensitive, that immediately gives you

902
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:20,560
a voltage gate at current conductance, which is basically a transistor. So now you can make

903
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:24,800
use of all the rules of logic gates and the truth tables and all these kinds of things.

904
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:31,360
And you get that for free. You don't need to evolve all the states of a truth table for

905
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:36,240
ands and ors, you've immediately got this for free by inventing this little thing.

906
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:40,800
And there's lots of things like that that you can find that will make use of the laws of

907
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:48,480
adhesion and other laws of mathematics and computation and mechanics, biomechanics and

908
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:55,680
other things. So if you think about evolution as basically searching the space of pointers

909
01:28:55,680 --> 01:29:02,800
into this platonic space, then it becomes reasonable to have a research program of

910
01:29:04,160 --> 01:29:08,320
looking around to see what the structure of that space is. And so people do that, for example,

911
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:11,600
you can download this thing called the map of mathematics. And it's just like

912
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:19,520
visualization of different types of mathematics and how they sort of connect together and so on.

913
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,640
So you could imagine that these things that we make, so these xenobots,

914
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:27,280
anthropots, all the kind of synthetic constructs, what they really are, are little periscopes.

915
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:33,760
They're little ways to kind of stick a probe up into this space and look around and see what do

916
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:39,760
we normally pull down in a normal embryo. And a normal embryo uses tons of these kind of what

917
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:46,240
physicists call free lunches, like lots of these amazing effects that they make use of that they

918
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:52,880
don't have to evolve from scratch. But around them, there are sets of hallows of other things

919
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:58,720
that they could use if the situation was a little bit different. And by doing these perturbational

920
01:29:58,720 --> 01:30:06,560
experiments, by pushing the embryo into scenarios that are different from what it normally does,

921
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:12,560
you get to explore the space. You get to explore all the stuff that's around it in latent space

922
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,840
and you find, oh, actually, they can do this and this and this. And we can even,

923
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:22,960
you know, we can start to think about what else is out there as a tool for engineering and for

924
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:34,240
discovery. And so that's step one, I guess, is just to realize that a lot of what evolution does is

925
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:43,200
search through the space of pointers into this reservoir of these amazing capabilities.

926
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:50,800
And then the other thing you can ask, and this gets progressively weirder and

927
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:58,240
this project is just beginning, but you can actually also ask the question of what are the

928
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:05,440
contents of that space? What is it doing on its own when it's not being instantiated here in the

929
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:09,360
physical world? In other words, the traditional, at least my understanding of the traditional

930
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:13,520
conception is that these things are, these forms are timeless. They just sort of

931
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:18,240
sit there and they don't change and they're permanent and they are how they are. I'm not sure

932
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:25,440
of that. I now have this kind of multi-layer model where we can start to imagine some,

933
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:31,680
I don't want to call it chemistry, but some rules for ways that these things can actually

934
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:37,280
interact with each other and some dynamics that can go on. And I have some ideas based on

935
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:44,880
the work of Patrick Grimm and turning logic sentences into visualizable dynamical systems,

936
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:50,240
how you can think about what the interaction laws and what the chemistry might be of these

937
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:54,960
kinds of concepts aside from the time when they're actually pulled down into a physical machine.

938
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:59,920
In the physical world. So that's the, I don't know if this makes any sense, but

939
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:06,560
that's the stuff that I've been thinking about. I find this fascinating. Michael Roger Penrose

940
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:13,280
is well known for talking about this platonic realm as well. So for three decades now, I think he is

941
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:20,480
people who want to put him down and say, Roger is not even a dualist. He's a trialist because

942
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:24,800
he's saying there is the physical stuff, there is the mental stuff, and then there is the platonic

943
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:32,240
stuff. My own perspective, and I wanted to sort of run that by you and get your thoughts on it,

944
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:39,680
is that we don't need a separate thing. If we say, okay, all of existence is a play

945
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:49,200
in a field of mentation, a field of subjectivity, then that field exists. And to be to exist is

946
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:53,840
to have properties. In other words, that field is what it is and not something else that it

947
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:59,600
conceivably could have been. It is not that it is what it is, and therefore it does what it does.

948
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:07,760
It has properties, it has intrinsic inherent dispositions, preferred ways of behaving,

949
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:15,280
preferred templates of behavior, so to say, and to to to abuse the language from depth psychology

950
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:19,840
could call these templates archetypes, which is the name Jung came up with. In other words,

951
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:25,600
if this is all one field of mentation, then it has to use a physical metaphor, it has

952
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:33,840
its preferred frequencies of oscillation, it has harmonics, it has resonant frequencies,

953
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:38,640
because it is what it is. And to be is to have properties, and it has the properties it has

954
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:45,440
and not others. Who do these sort of intrinsic inherent resonant frequencies, these archetypal

955
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:51,120
templates account for what you're talking about without our having to postulate a separate platonic

956
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:57,680
realm? Yeah, yes, super. So on the one hand, I mean, I agree with you in that I don't think it's

957
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:02,560
fundamentally like really in the end of all things, I don't think it's a separate realm. So I agree

958
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:07,600
with you, this is all, you know, these are all components of one bit fundamental field. But

959
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:15,280
I think for the time being, I think that's a useful, it's a useful frame to think of

960
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:20,160
because it leads to specific questions about how do we explore it, how do we map it,

961
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:25,920
the things like that. But the frequencies and the vibrations, I'm really glad you brought

962
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:31,120
that up because that's an interesting example of actually what we're doing and how we're studying it.

963
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:39,520
One thing that you might think that hangs out in this platonic realm, one thing that might

964
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:46,720
hang out there are logical statements, right, just, you know, pieces of basic logic, right.

965
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:54,800
So let's take the Liar Paradox, the self-referential sentence that says this sentence is false.

966
01:34:55,440 --> 01:35:01,040
So one interesting thing about that is there's this philosopher, Patrick Grimm, if anybody

967
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:06,480
doesn't know, he's really good. And he had this work in the 90s, which is very interesting,

968
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:15,200
where he points out the following. If you look at that sentence, it's a paradox only if you

969
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:21,040
insist on a static, unchanging truth value. So if you want a truth value, you can't and it's a

970
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:25,440
paradox and okay, what do we do? But if you're willing to say that what it actually is is a

971
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:29,680
dynamical system where you actually look at it and you say, okay, this statement is false.

972
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:33,440
Okay, so it's false and you say, oh, wait a minute, but that might mean it's true. So it's true.

973
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:41,360
So as you, as a mind, as a perspective looks on this thing, what you actually see is an

974
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:46,160
oscillation. You see a true, false, true, false, true, false. So now something interesting happens

975
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:50,480
and Grimm showed how you can take either one dimensional or two dimensional. So you can do

976
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:56,480
things like he'll say, you know, sentence A, I am as true as sentence B is false. And then

977
01:35:56,480 --> 01:36:00,960
sentence B says, I am twice as true as sentence A, right. And you plot those true and you get this

978
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:04,880
like crazy thing. And then it's chaotic. And sometimes they settle down, sometimes they don't

979
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:09,760
settle down, you can imagine dynamical systems that you can make all kinds of. So, so now what

980
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:15,200
you've got is something interesting. So there's a layer of this, of this space, consisting of

981
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:21,280
logical statements. Some of them are like rocks, they have a constant truth value, you know, pi is

982
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:25,040
more than three bang, that just sits there, doesn't do anything. It's completely static,

983
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:29,040
pretty boring. And so that kind of hangs out. But then you've got this other thing that's like a

984
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:33,200
it's like a it's like a simple oscillator, right? It's like a simple, you know, the simple, the

985
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:37,360
liar, the basic liar paradox is just just sitting there, it's oscillating true, false, true, false,

986
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:41,840
true, false. That's what it's doing. So this is this is what led me to this idea that that it may

987
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:47,120
not actually be these like forms that are locked in stone and don't do anything. Some of them look

988
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:52,800
like they have a dynamics to it. Then you can imagine multiple sentences that are interacting

989
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:57,120
with each other. And they have a really complex and you can plot them in different ways. You can

990
01:36:57,120 --> 01:37:00,320
either plot them as a function of time, in which case they they vibrate, then they have

991
01:37:00,320 --> 01:37:04,080
different frequencies, as you just said, and they do all these things. Or you can plot them in a

992
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:07,440
slightly higher dimensional space, and then you just get this shape, right? You get the shape

993
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:12,400
that you can see is okay, this set of logical claims makes this this crazy complicated looking

994
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:16,400
shape and grim actually like plot some of these out. It's pretty cool. So,

995
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:25,040
and so just one last thing. And so we're building I have one of the folks in my lab and I are making

996
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:29,360
an actual visualizer for these things so that you start with some logical statements and then

997
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:35,040
you actually see what what they look like. You can now comes the part where you can actually

998
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:40,240
instantiate a chemistry to it. Because what you can say is, okay, here's a set of statements

999
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:46,000
that refer to a few different things, let's say, you know, ABC, here's a set of statements that

1000
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,560
refer to C, D and E. Well, they have something in common, that would be the C. And that means

1001
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:54,960
that you can imagine like atoms with a free, you know, with a free a hole in their orbital,

1002
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:59,520
they can they can actually come come together because you can they can combine. If it was ABC

1003
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:04,400
and DEF, then, you know, noble gases, right, they don't combine at all, they don't interact with each

1004
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:10,080
other, sort of slide right by but but but but but sent but sets of sentences that do refer to

1005
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:14,560
things in common. Now you can look at intersect at their interactions. And you can say, well,

1006
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:18,000
when they do come together, what happens? So this thing has a shape, this thing has a shape,

1007
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,480
when they come together, what's the shape? So it turns out that, and this is just like a tiny

1008
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:27,280
corner of that space, we're just looking at something super like simple and and and and basic,

1009
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:32,240
which is just like these logical sentences, of course, if if that space exists at all,

1010
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:36,080
there's going to be like huge amount of things in there that we don't know how to deal with.

1011
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:41,360
But just just that alone, we can we can start to and then you can ask some some things like this,

1012
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:47,280
for example, what's the what's the frequency of the oscillator? There isn't a time component here,

1013
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:52,320
the well, there isn't an external time component here. What there is is the frame rate of whatever

1014
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:57,040
cognitive system is picking up that liar paradox. So the lie paradox is hanging out there when you

1015
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:02,400
have a system that can follow it through at a rate of one per second, for example, well, then

1016
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:06,640
that's the frequency at that time. If you write if you're if you're much faster than that, well,

1017
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:10,560
then you get a faster feeling. So it's not intrinsic. It's again, from the perspective of

1018
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:15,920
whichever mind has now, you know, is now in resonance with this thing. So all that is

1019
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:20,320
so this is all super early, like I don't know if any of this is going to go anywhere. So

1020
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:25,520
take it all with a grain of salt. But I do very much like that you immediately went to the kind

1021
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:30,880
of vibration stuff, because I think that's a good way to start thinking about it. And there's also,

1022
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:36,240
if any of you have seen, and I don't remember the link at the top of my head, but Richard Watson,

1023
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:40,560
who's a evolutionary biologist and computer scientist that I do a lot of collaborations with,

1024
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:45,280
he has an amazing set of videos on YouTube. It's about six hours total called songs of

1025
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:50,640
mind and life. And it digs very deep into this into there's not not the Platonic space stuff, but

1026
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:58,240
but but this notion of the intersection between cognition and and vibration and and and things

1027
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:02,960
like that. And so if anybody's interested in that, definitely check it out. It's just amazing.

1028
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:08,240
It is fascinating that you're going in this direction. I didn't know that I'm very happy

1029
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:15,760
to learn it. Just a brief comment. I'm not just to add to to your plate, things that you can think

1030
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:20,800
about. The liar paradox, you can make it more complex, because you can split it, you can say

1031
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:27,600
the fall the next sentence is false. While the next sentence is the previous sentence is true.

1032
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:32,880
And then you sort of have an extended liar paradox. So you can you can extend this and

1033
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:37,360
depending on how you model it, this can give you extra degrees of freedom.

1034
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:45,680
Another is a quick sales pitch for a philosopher from my country that never got proper recognition.

1035
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:53,280
His name is Laudsen Brouwer. He lived in the late 19th, early 20th century. And his realization

1036
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:59,040
was that the five axioms of Aristotelian logic are just that. Well, not his realization. We know

1037
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:06,480
that from Agrippa's Trilemma, Munchhausen's Trilemma, logic cannot be used to validate logic

1038
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:12,720
without running into circular reason. In other words, the axioms of logic are arbitrary. The only

1039
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:16,960
thing they have going for them is that we think they are self evidently true. And when we apply

1040
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:24,240
them empirically, most of the time they work, not always quantum mechanics comes in here and

1041
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:32,400
tells us that it's not always the case. But Brouwer, he figured that the law of excluded middle,

1042
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:39,760
which is one of the five axioms, it's the axiom that says every statement is either true or false,

1043
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:49,760
not both and not neither. And he decided to get rid of this axiom and see if we could construct a

1044
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:56,640
coherent logic, operationally applicable and coherent, internally consistent logic without

1045
01:41:56,640 --> 01:42:02,720
that axiom. And lo and behold, we can. And in some application, it's much more reasonable than

1046
01:42:02,720 --> 01:42:11,280
Aristotelian logic. He called it intuitionist logic. And that gives you just a quick example

1047
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:19,920
of one case in which it's very compelling that it's a better logic in mathematics. And therefore,

1048
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:27,120
by implication in physics and the other natural sciences, you can, because of the law of excluded

1049
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:36,800
middle, you can prove that something exists by proving that it cannot not exist. And that allows

1050
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:42,960
you to prove that something exists without ever being able to conceive of an example of it.

1051
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:51,920
An example, a simple example of that which you have just proven that it exists. And under

1052
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:57,680
intuitionist logic, this doesn't work because you don't have the law of excluded middle. So to prove

1053
01:42:57,680 --> 01:43:05,920
that something exists, you have to produce one example. And that is much more empirically intuitive,

1054
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:12,080
right? Because how can you prove that something exists if you can't even give me or conceive of

1055
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:17,040
an example? Tell me what it is that you're that you have proven to exist. And you can't even say

1056
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:23,280
that you can't even tell me that. So I, you wouldn't get the oscillations from that. Because to get

1057
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:30,240
to the oscillations, you don't have fixed truth values, but you're still using the law of excluded

1058
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:38,480
middle. But you could get some, you could get some other quite interesting dynamics. And some people,

1059
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:45,760
some people have speculated about whether something like this, intuitionist logic,

1060
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:50,320
would be a better path for us to make sense of the so-called high strangeness phenomena, some

1061
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:57,680
psychological phenomena that are weirder than dreams. And yet people report it. So it's a,

1062
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:04,320
it's a phenomenal reality and stuff that people experience. So how is their mind operating to

1063
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:09,280
produce high strangeness phenomena? Or how is the mind of nature operating to produce high

1064
01:44:09,280 --> 01:44:16,560
strangeness phenomena? And the hypothesis I raised was it is not using the law of excluded middle.

1065
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:24,640
That's, that's monkey logic. It's not nature's logic. Anyway, just wanted to put it out there.

1066
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:30,720
Loudson Brower is the name of the guy that should be as well known as Spinoza, but unfortunately

1067
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:36,320
he isn't. He had some other weird thinking about social issues that maybe is the reason

1068
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:40,720
that he would never be popular in the world today, but he had some very interesting ideas.

1069
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:45,920
Yeah, super cool. Thanks. That's, that's, that's great. I was aware of intuitionism,

1070
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:51,360
but I didn't connect it to this, to this grim stuff. So that's, that's very good.

1071
01:44:51,360 --> 01:44:56,560
I just wrote his name on the chat. So people, because people will not know how to write down

1072
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:03,840
Loudson Brower. So I just, I just put it there. That's very good. That's very good. Well, you know,

1073
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:09,280
one is, I'll definitely think about that. That's excellent. And you know, another thing we started

1074
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:14,960
to think about is, is enabling, I mean, this is some steps down, but enabling some of the, again,

1075
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:20,480
I'm really, I'm really interested in this, this notion of, as William James once said that

1076
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:26,880
thoughts are the thinker, you know, and this idea of active data and, and, and sort of erasing

1077
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:33,040
the distinction between passive data that, and, and in the context of this thing we were just

1078
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:38,080
talking about, you could imagine that some of the sentences contain elements that actually modify

1079
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:41,920
the sentences. So you could imagine, right, a self-referential kind of thing where there are

1080
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:46,240
certain atoms that actually go and cut out pieces from another sentence or alter edit,

1081
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:50,000
you know, some sort of spring rewriting rules or something like that, right? So you can imagine,

1082
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,520
but, but, but the other thing about that is to go back to, because I think I forgot to mention

1083
01:45:53,520 --> 01:46:01,440
this in the business about memories. If, if the job, if, if, if what the, the system wants to do

1084
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:08,160
is remap ngrams and other pieces of information that it got from its past self or from whoever,

1085
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:14,400
into the new context, you could imagine that the, the ngrams themselves might be active. In

1086
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:18,080
other words, they don't have to be completely passive. They could also, there might be some

1087
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:22,560
advantages to them to be picked up and nourished, you know, maybe they're just passive molecules,

1088
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:27,840
but maybe they're, maybe they're not molecules, maybe they're vibration cycles, or maybe they

1089
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:33,920
write some kind of, some kind of oscillation patterns that actually can be fed by appropriate

1090
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:38,800
resonance with, with the cognitive system that they're going into. And so maybe they can actually

1091
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:43,920
increase the likelihood that they get picked up and reproduced or, or something by, by

1092
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:47,680
dynamics that they do, right? So, so they don't have to be passive entirely. So

1093
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:53,520
as I'm also, also kind of fooling around with some, with some models like that of, of, of

1094
01:46:53,520 --> 01:47:01,120
memories as self reproducing patterns that have their own little tiny agendas. And maybe it's

1095
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:05,520
as persist, you know, that may be the simplest thing, but maybe it's something else, maybe it's

1096
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:11,360
more than persist, maybe it's, you know, kind of like individual neurons like to have a job,

1097
01:47:11,360 --> 01:47:14,880
you know, they like to connect to circuits where they're actually going to, going to do something.

1098
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,360
And so maybe these things too, maybe, you know, maybe their primary

1099
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:25,920
driver is to be, to be remapped and in the new, in their new context and not be wiped out,

1100
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:30,960
which kind of gets to this kind of basic philosophical thing, which is, you know,

1101
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:35,920
there's some things called Bateson's paradox, this idea that if you're a species, right,

1102
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:39,920
you have a choice. If you don't change with the environment, you're going to die out, right?

1103
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:44,000
You're going to, you're going to be go extinct. But if you do change, well, you're also kind of

1104
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,000
gone because you're not the same anymore, right? So, so what do you do? And I think that, yes,

1105
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,840
that's the case for that. That's a dilemma that, that is, is a problem for evolutionary lineages.

1106
01:47:54,560 --> 01:48:01,520
Either way, you're not going to persist as that same thing. But it's also, I think, a problem for

1107
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:06,480
any kind of cognitive agent, because if you really are intent on not changing and persisting as you

1108
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:10,880
are, then you can't learn, you can't modify yourself, you can't improve, you can't, you know,

1109
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:17,200
you can't make any changes in light of further experience. You know that the most profound

1110
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:21,040
experiences are going to change you in some way, you're just not, whether it's, you know, the

1111
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:25,120
mechanics of metamorphosis or puberty or whether it's learning, and you're just not going to be

1112
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:29,840
the same. And so committing to this idea that whatever persists, it's not going to be a thing,

1113
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:35,520
it's going to be a pattern. And then, then, then, then, then it makes sense, then you can be an

1114
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:41,600
evolutionary lineage that changes over time. And, and then you can be a human way or any other kind

1115
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:46,560
of creature where your cells and the molecules in your brain go in and out and changes come,

1116
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:51,600
but you're still the same, not because you're the same thing, but because you have an extended

1117
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:56,080
cognitive history that, that ties it all together. So, yeah.

1118
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:03,200
Amir, just a quick point. I wanted to ask Mike was simple. He has no question about an earlier

1119
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:11,840
topic before he leaves. So if I have 30 seconds in mind to the end, it's a quick question just for

1120
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:17,600
me to understand that. Do you want to do it now? It's a different, it's the earlier topic about

1121
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:23,120
things. We can do it quickly, Mike. It's just from my understanding and maybe the understanding of

1122
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:29,360
the people here. When you said we have to be open from multiple points of views, I'll talk about

1123
01:49:29,360 --> 01:49:34,400
point of, point of view as things. If there are things, then, then a thing has its point of view.

1124
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:43,280
If I, if we don't have any criteria for telling what is a valid thing and what is not, then we

1125
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:49,440
have an exponential explosion of the combinations of permutations of the states of nature. All of

1126
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:54,080
these combinations and permutations can be things and they partly overlap. So it would have an

1127
01:49:54,080 --> 01:50:01,920
exponential explosion, explosion of things and points of view. Is that what you are open to

1128
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:06,880
or do you think there actually is a criterion for telling what is a thing and what is not? It's

1129
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:13,600
just that we don't know what it is and it may not be the same thing as life. I think there is a

1130
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:19,040
criterion, but I think that criterion is different from forever. So I apologize in advance. This is

1131
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:24,480
not going to be satisfying, but this is what I think. I think that the criterion is from the

1132
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:31,680
perspective of each, each, each, each agent. In other words, I think that the universe is

1133
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:38,080
probably infinite, but, but, but certainly and, you know, a hyper astronomical number of

1134
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:43,120
perspectives and of, of beings. And from the perspective of each one of those beings,

1135
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,960
a different set of things are things and a different set are not things. And so, so yes,

1136
01:50:48,960 --> 01:50:53,120
that they're absolutely and the criterion is again, from the perspective of each observer,

1137
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:58,800
the criterion from the perspective of that observer is does it help sense making? Does it,

1138
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:04,000
does it, it, does it give me a greater purchase on the world, both in practical terms, but also

1139
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,520
internally, right, in my own sense making, however humble that or primitive that might be for simple

1140
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:15,440
agents. But, but that's right. So you can ask any, if provided you know how to communicate with it.

1141
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:19,840
So we do okay, left hemisphere to left hemisphere, we're working on ways to ask your liver questions

1142
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:24,320
like quite literally we're asking for, we're now trying to develop some technology to communicate

1143
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:29,200
with various other very unconventional agents. And from those kind of agents,

1144
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:37,440
you will get a different set of what do I consider to be things, right. So, so, so your liver will

1145
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:41,280
have all kinds of comments about persistent physiological states as things. And we will

1146
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:44,160
look at those and say, no, that's that that's, I don't care about that. That's not a thing.

1147
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:50,400
IIT also takes this perspective that the criteria is based on the perspective of the thing. It's,

1148
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:56,080
it's the first person perspective of the thing. But IIT would say the criteria is to maximize

1149
01:51:56,080 --> 01:52:01,360
integrated information. Whatever partitioning maximizes information integration, that determines

1150
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:07,680
what are the things. And but what you're saying is, is to maximize sense making. That's where you

1151
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:12,400
depart from IIT. Instead of maximize integrated information, you maximize sense making. There

1152
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:21,440
should be a way to formalize this. I really think you and Julia would make an exquisite pair.

1153
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:27,040
Yeah, yeah, it's, yeah, it's been a while, actually. We used to, we used to meet up at the,

1154
01:52:27,040 --> 01:52:32,560
at some Templeton meetings that they used to have at the Arizona, at the ASU. So it's been

1155
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:36,240
a while since I've seen them. So I will, I will talk to them again, I think. But no, you're right.

1156
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:44,000
And I think that I, you know, the PHY and things like that are pretty good. I mean,

1157
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:47,680
I call it sense making. But of course, I don't have a formula that you can, that you can

1158
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:52,480
calculate. IIT is almost a formula you can calculate. And certainly there are surrogate

1159
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:58,480
metrics that you actually can calculate. So that, so it has that benefit of it. But I am really

1160
01:52:58,480 --> 01:53:03,440
interested in, and this is where some of the experimental stuff kind of leads into, you know,

1161
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:10,720
like bigger, bigger issues. I'm really interested in what an explanation is. And the idea that what

1162
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:14,720
we are looking for as beings, not just as scientists, but as beings, we are looking for

1163
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:20,160
a better understanding of the world, not just looking backwards as far as explaining what

1164
01:53:20,160 --> 01:53:25,040
just happened, not looking downwards as far as figuring out the particles or the components of

1165
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:30,240
whatever just happened, but actually looking forwards. In other words, I think a good explanation

1166
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:35,280
is a story about the world that helps you do the next good thing. In other words, it's something

1167
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:42,320
that it's looking forward. It's increasing insight, not a dissection of what the hell just happened.

1168
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:46,800
But as living agents, we have to live forward. We don't live backward the way that

1169
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:52,000
third-person descriptions of science can do. We have to decide what do we do next. And these

1170
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:59,920
things are very complex. And as beings, what I like from explanations are something that

1171
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:06,080
raises my sense-making of the world, such that I see, ah, well, given that, now I can do this or

1172
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:10,880
now I should do this. And I think that is, when I talk about sense-making, that's what I mean. I mean

1173
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:16,240
that agents that have to actively engage with the world, and I don't mean the three-dimensional world.

1174
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:20,480
I mean, whatever world they live in, it might be a physiological state space, it might be anatomical,

1175
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:26,240
whatever world they actually live in. The fact that they have to engage with it is what makes

1176
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:31,360
them an observer. And this is, like you mentioned, like, well, maybe photographic film is an observer.

1177
01:54:31,360 --> 01:54:35,200
Well, kind of, but a really tiny one, because the photographic film is not going to do anything

1178
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:40,160
different based on what it sees on the film. At least the standard film doesn't do that. Whereas

1179
01:54:40,160 --> 01:54:45,360
things that I would call a significant agent is something that takes observations. And then the

1180
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:50,800
observations matter because it tries to fit them together into a compressed representation of,

1181
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:55,840
that helps it to know, well, what the hell do I do now after that? And so that's why

1182
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:01,680
I think that agents see things and they see other agents. Because if you don't do that,

1183
01:55:01,680 --> 01:55:06,720
it does not help you understand the world you're living in. And as a practical matter,

1184
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:12,000
you'll be dead in no time as a biological agent if you don't understand what you're dealing with.

1185
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:20,160
There is work in physics, in foundations of physics, that dovetails very well with your

1186
01:55:20,160 --> 01:55:27,440
thoughts here. Marcus Miller from the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the way he frames physics

1187
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:34,080
is to ask the question, what will I see next? In other words, can I predict the states of the

1188
01:55:34,080 --> 01:55:40,000
world? And all of physics can be rewritten in terms of this question, what will I see next,

1189
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:45,200
as opposed to under the assumption that there is a fixed world out there which experiments telling

1190
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:49,360
us, well, if there is such a world, it's not physical. Unless you entertain all kinds of

1191
01:55:49,440 --> 01:56:00,800
fantasies about multiverses and super determinism, hidden variables. But if you could relate what

1192
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:06,560
will I see next to what should I do next, because what you would do next must be informed by your

1193
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:12,560
ability to predict the world, what the world would do next. There is a way to mathematically

1194
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:19,360
formalize this. Marcus has done it. Actually, Essential Foundation, we just got a researcher,

1195
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:26,160
we are funding a researcher at the University of Tudor in Switzerland to do research on this

1196
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:32,480
so-called physics of first-person perspective. Yeah, yeah. Let me just start from scratch here.

1197
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:36,640
Yep, yep. No, that's really great. And the other, and I wonder if they talk to each other,

1198
01:56:36,640 --> 01:56:42,400
I don't know, but Carl Friston and Chris Fields and Mark Solms and these guys that I work with,

1199
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:47,760
they also work on exactly this, so active inference and basically predicting your own

1200
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:53,520
next sensory states and how that, you know, they call it, I think it's Carl's term,

1201
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:57,600
the physics of sentience and the sentience of physics, right? So like, this is, you know,

1202
01:56:57,600 --> 01:57:02,000
you guys, so I don't know, I'm here, you guys might want to see if they can show up at some

1203
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,080
point, there's some really interesting stuff. So hopefully they're talking to Miller and it's all

1204
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:11,280
kind of one thing, but yes, I completely agree with you, predicting what you are going to experience

1205
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:21,680
next is a really fruitful kind of frame for this. I sent Marcus Carl's paper published on

1206
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:28,080
the IEEE, one of the IEEE journals in 2013 or 14 about active inference,

1207
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:35,440
but I didn't hear from Marcus back. The thing, I mean, I love the work of Carl Friston, by the way,

1208
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:40,000
but it's amazing how much resistance there is to it because people say, well, I can't understand

1209
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:46,960
it anyway, so why will I even try? Why will I even bother? Carl is not doing himself a favor

1210
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:54,400
by his writing style. Yeah, I mean, he's an amazing genius and, you know, I sure as heck don't

1211
01:57:54,400 --> 01:58:02,720
understand all the math behind it, but I think the very simple, so there's one kind of slice of

1212
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:08,240
this, which is just surprise minimization, just alone this idea of surprise minimization is

1213
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:15,200
is really powerful and you can apply it to all kinds of scenarios as Carl has done from ecosystems

1214
01:58:15,200 --> 01:58:21,200
to psychiatry to whatever. We had a project recently that it isn't published yet, but

1215
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:31,280
another grad student in my lab, Frans Quichling, he's looking at surprise and yeast in, sorry,

1216
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:37,040
not yeast, algae, algae. So, believe it or not, algae can be surprised and the reason that algae

1217
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:40,800
can be surprised is because they form expectations of what's going to happen next and you can

1218
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:45,680
subvert those expectations and then they get stressed out and they're surprised. So, this kind

1219
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:49,920
of thing and then, you know, Chris and Chris Fields and then Carl can take it, you know, sort of

1220
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:53,760
much further down and look at symmetrical interactions between the system and its environment

1221
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:57,600
and who's learning about whom and, you know, turns out like both are learning about both.

1222
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:04,480
Michael, if you're, I mean, sorry, I'm taking too much of your time, but here we may converge

1223
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:10,080
because if you go for this, if you go for active inference, surprise, minimization,

1224
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:17,600
which goes back to information theory, you will get Markov blankets, which means that you will

1225
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:25,280
get life. So, it may, your criterion for determining what things are may actually be life if you pursue

1226
01:59:25,280 --> 01:59:31,600
that consistently because, you know, Markov blankets, you get cell membranes, active inference,

1227
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:37,920
you have inner models, you know, inner states can only communicate with external states or the

1228
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:43,520
other way around by proxy through the states of the Markov blanket. This is life. Actually,

1229
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:49,120
Carl wrote the paper saying that this is life. Yeah, which I'm 100% on board with. That part is

1230
01:59:49,120 --> 01:59:56,400
completely fine. I just think that if we take it seriously, I think we're going to be able to include

1231
01:59:56,400 --> 02:00:01,760
in that umbrella with that exact same framework, a bunch of stuff that any reasonable biologist

1232
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:06,320
is going to say, well, I don't know what this is, but it isn't life. And I'm okay. I mean, I think

1233
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:09,760
what the move that you're making, and I would be perfectly comfortable with it, is to say,

1234
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:15,600
guys, you got the wrong definition of life. This is what should be life, right? So, I'm okay with

1235
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:20,560
that. But at that point, you know, it's, I don't know, the vocabulary, I'm kind of, yeah, less

1236
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:26,560
tight to it. Fantastic. Beautiful. Thank you. So, yeah, felt like a

1237
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:36,000
super amazing dialogue, which points seem to be in opposite direction and then end up converging

1238
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,440
very naturally, which is very beautiful to see. I just want to say very quickly before you go,

1239
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:44,320
Michael, because I mentioned it last time, Douglas Harding. But again, just another weird

1240
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:48,640
coincidence, because he'd written this book on having no head, which you, which was the same

1241
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:53,360
title, he wrote that in 1961. And it has the same title as a paper, I think you co-authored.

1242
02:00:53,360 --> 02:00:58,800
He also wrote a book called The Science of the First Person in 1974. So it felt like there's

1243
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:03,120
someone back there writing the titles of all these kind of new ideas from a very different

1244
02:01:03,120 --> 02:01:08,400
perspective. He was kind of an architect and a mystic and a philosopher. Anyway, maybe we'll

1245
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:13,280
bring someone along that, that kind of followed that work. Just, I know we're over time for you,

1246
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:17,440
Michael. So just huge gratitude one more time. It's always fascinating. Thank you so much.

1247
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:21,680
Yeah, it's just brilliant. And I hope you come back one day and then you mentioned several other

1248
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:25,920
people that would be worth speaking to as well. So thank you, Michael.

1249
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:28,720
Sure. You know, I absolutely will. Thank you. Thank you so much. Yeah. And thank you,

1250
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:31,200
Bernardo. It was awesome to discuss all this with you, of course.

1251
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:34,960
Yeah. Oh, just to say quickly, everyone, we're staying on the call for a little while, Bernardo,

1252
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:37,680
because sometimes what happened last time when you left, a lot of people left not realize it.

1253
02:01:37,680 --> 02:01:40,560
And then we're like, oh, we didn't realize it. So yeah, carry on, Michael. We'll be here

1254
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:43,680
continuing for a little bit, but Michael, carry on with what you're saying.

1255
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:47,920
Cool. Yeah. No, sorry. I just, yeah, I was just thanking you and thanking Bernardo because it's,

1256
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:52,160
you know, a fascinating conversation, as always. I've taken a bunch of notes on some of the stuff

1257
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:56,240
you said. So very interesting. So yes, I look forward to more at any point.

1258
02:01:56,240 --> 02:02:12,160
Great. Exciting. Thank you so much. Take care, Michael. Thanks, everybody. Appreciate it.
