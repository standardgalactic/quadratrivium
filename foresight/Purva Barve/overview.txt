Checking Purva Barve/Is social media making us antisocialï¼Ÿ.txt
Purva starts her video by acknowledging the hesitation she initially felt about recording herself due to shyness, but she overcame it to share her thoughts on how social media is impacting the youth, particularly in terms of authenticity and real-life interactions. She observes that many people present themselves differently online than they are in reality, which can lead to a gradual transformation into a persona that is not truly their own. Purva points out that her generation often trivializes social interactions, using humor and memes to cope with or dismiss meaningful connections.

She notes a specific incident at Starbucks where she saw a group of friends who, upon receiving their orders, immediately reached for their phones to take pictures rather than savoring their food and each other's company. This behavior, she argues, is indicative of how social media is making us anti-social, prioritizing the perfect Instagram story over genuine experiences.

Purva laments the strong need among young people to appear flawless on social media, which involves significant effort in editing photos and curating content to impress others. She questions whether this constant striving for approval and visibility on weekends is truly worth it. Purva suggests that true happiness can be found in simpler, less materialistic moments, such as appreciating a sunrise, looking through photo albums with family, or sharing genuine smiles and conversations.

She emphasizes the importance of real-life interactions and helping each other, rather than just exchanging memes. Purva concludes by acknowledging that finding joy in the moment is not always easy but argues that it's not as difficult as we might think, and it's worth giving it a try for a more fulfilling life.
