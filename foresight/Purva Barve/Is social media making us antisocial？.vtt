Hey everyone, this is Purva and I'm really sure you all are wondering what is this audition

00:05.360 --> 00:12.160
doing but a few months ago I had written this small article on how social media is affecting

00:12.160 --> 00:18.160
us especially the youth and a lot of people suggested me that I should video record it

00:19.360 --> 00:23.280
but I was feeling really shy to come in front of the camera and say all that

00:23.840 --> 00:29.840
but I think I gave it a try so let me know if you like it and let's go

00:30.560 --> 00:36.800
okay tell me one thing do you ever stand in front of a mirror and ask yourself who you really are

00:37.440 --> 00:46.560
you know I feel a lot of people make themselves out to be someone they're not and how scary it is

00:46.560 --> 00:51.360
when you pretend to be something you're not and then eventually you start becoming that person

00:52.080 --> 00:57.280
and then have the audacity to say I'm just being myself I mean who are you kidding here

00:57.280 --> 01:04.880
why are we neglecting or rejecting originality the reason why most of us are like this is only us

01:04.880 --> 01:11.040
we are the main culprits here you know in my generation especially in my generation every

01:11.040 --> 01:16.880
single thing is a joke to us we make memes about everything and I know some of you all don't even

01:16.880 --> 01:24.000
know what a meme is it's basically a joke but yeah everything is a joke to us and you know for

01:24.000 --> 01:29.600
example it's funny how we encourage the thought of how people get bored after socializing for two

01:29.600 --> 01:35.520
hours and how they need their space isn't it actually funny how social media is making us

01:35.520 --> 01:42.320
anti-social so a few months back I was having coffee in Starbucks and I saw a group of friends

01:42.320 --> 01:47.920
entering probably of my age they gave their order found a comfortable place to settle down

01:47.920 --> 01:53.840
and nothing they were nicely chit chatting laughing as soon as their order arrived everybody took out

01:53.840 --> 01:59.520
their phones within a second and everybody was taking pictures of their coffee their food they

01:59.520 --> 02:05.760
were not bothered about tasting it you know I just finished my coffee and came outside

02:06.720 --> 02:14.320
and while I was waiting for my driver to pick me up I saw two older men having a small cup of tea

02:14.320 --> 02:19.440
and you know laughing their heart out they were giving each other high fives they were basically

02:19.440 --> 02:27.920
enjoying the moment and they were not bothered about the place the food the environment nothing

02:27.920 --> 02:35.360
they were just in the moment and I just stood there wondering why can't we all be this easy going

02:35.840 --> 02:41.040
well most of them out there go to good-looking places eat good-looking food just because their

02:41.040 --> 02:47.120
instagram story needs to be perfect you know even on birthdays some people are so concerned about

02:47.120 --> 02:53.840
recording the cake cutting part that they forget to actually genuinely sing for the person who is

02:53.840 --> 02:59.920
celebrating his day or you know clap for him nothing they just bothered about taking a video

03:00.000 --> 03:06.640
putting it on social media as soon as possible that's it you know and I really can't blame anyone

03:06.640 --> 03:12.160
here or you know there's no offense to anyone because sometimes somewhere even I have done this

03:12.160 --> 03:18.960
and it makes me so sad that we don't even notice this why is the need of showing off so strong

03:18.960 --> 03:25.600
in our generation why I mean we are forgetting to live in the moment you know all we can think

03:25.600 --> 03:32.560
about is how can I look flawless on social media so that other people won't judge why is the definition

03:32.560 --> 03:40.160
of enjoyment or happiness dependent on such materialistic things why some of you all don't

03:40.160 --> 03:46.240
even know how much effort we have to put in before posting a picture on instagram you know editing it

03:46.240 --> 03:52.960
giving it a good caption so everybody will think how cool I am and then asking others for their

03:52.960 --> 03:59.200
approval posting on weekends so that more people can see it you know not repeating the same clothes

04:00.000 --> 04:06.400
and the list goes on do you ever just think is it really worth it is doing all this stuff

04:06.400 --> 04:13.440
just for one post is it really worth it you know sometimes being just the way you are waking up

04:13.440 --> 04:20.880
and admiring the sunset before checking your phone or you know looking at an old photo album with your

04:20.880 --> 04:28.160
mom and dad having remember when moments with your cousins staring at this guy with your favorite music

04:28.160 --> 04:33.440
you know and hanging out with that one person or that one friend who you really care about

04:34.160 --> 04:40.720
getting a genuine smile from a stranger and a lot of small things which we don't even notice can

04:40.720 --> 04:47.520
make you so happy unknowingly okay I know most of y'all are thinking why is this girl sounding

04:47.600 --> 04:54.320
like a gyanibaba or someone like that but to be honest we are forgetting that we were made to

04:54.320 --> 05:00.400
interact with each other help each other and by interacting I don't mean interact by sending

05:00.400 --> 05:07.760
memes just really interact in person you know and lastly I want to say that happiness doesn't mean

05:08.400 --> 05:15.280
that you have to be happy all the time I mean who is happy 24 7365 that's not possible right

05:15.840 --> 05:25.840
but to find joy and to be alive in the moment and I know it's not as easy as it sounds or

05:25.840 --> 05:31.200
as easy as it looks but is it really that hard to just give it a try
