Hey everyone, this is Purva and I'm really sure you all are wondering what is this audition

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:12,160
doing but a few months ago I had written this small article on how social media is affecting

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,160
us especially the youth and a lot of people suggested me that I should video record it

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,280
but I was feeling really shy to come in front of the camera and say all that

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,840
but I think I gave it a try so let me know if you like it and let's go

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,800
okay tell me one thing do you ever stand in front of a mirror and ask yourself who you really are

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:46,560
you know I feel a lot of people make themselves out to be someone they're not and how scary it is

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,360
when you pretend to be something you're not and then eventually you start becoming that person

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,280
and then have the audacity to say I'm just being myself I mean who are you kidding here

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,880
why are we neglecting or rejecting originality the reason why most of us are like this is only us

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:11,040
we are the main culprits here you know in my generation especially in my generation every

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,880
single thing is a joke to us we make memes about everything and I know some of you all don't even

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:24,000
know what a meme is it's basically a joke but yeah everything is a joke to us and you know for

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,600
example it's funny how we encourage the thought of how people get bored after socializing for two

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,520
hours and how they need their space isn't it actually funny how social media is making us

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:42,320
anti-social so a few months back I was having coffee in Starbucks and I saw a group of friends

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,920
entering probably of my age they gave their order found a comfortable place to settle down

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,840
and nothing they were nicely chit chatting laughing as soon as their order arrived everybody took out

19
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,520
their phones within a second and everybody was taking pictures of their coffee their food they

20
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,760
were not bothered about tasting it you know I just finished my coffee and came outside

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:14,320
and while I was waiting for my driver to pick me up I saw two older men having a small cup of tea

22
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,440
and you know laughing their heart out they were giving each other high fives they were basically

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:27,920
enjoying the moment and they were not bothered about the place the food the environment nothing

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:35,360
they were just in the moment and I just stood there wondering why can't we all be this easy going

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,040
well most of them out there go to good-looking places eat good-looking food just because their

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,120
instagram story needs to be perfect you know even on birthdays some people are so concerned about

27
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,840
recording the cake cutting part that they forget to actually genuinely sing for the person who is

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,920
celebrating his day or you know clap for him nothing they just bothered about taking a video

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,640
putting it on social media as soon as possible that's it you know and I really can't blame anyone

30
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,160
here or you know there's no offense to anyone because sometimes somewhere even I have done this

31
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,960
and it makes me so sad that we don't even notice this why is the need of showing off so strong

32
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,600
in our generation why I mean we are forgetting to live in the moment you know all we can think

33
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:32,560
about is how can I look flawless on social media so that other people won't judge why is the definition

34
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:40,160
of enjoyment or happiness dependent on such materialistic things why some of you all don't

35
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,240
even know how much effort we have to put in before posting a picture on instagram you know editing it

36
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,960
giving it a good caption so everybody will think how cool I am and then asking others for their

37
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,200
approval posting on weekends so that more people can see it you know not repeating the same clothes

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,400
and the list goes on do you ever just think is it really worth it is doing all this stuff

39
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,440
just for one post is it really worth it you know sometimes being just the way you are waking up

40
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:20,880
and admiring the sunset before checking your phone or you know looking at an old photo album with your

41
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:28,160
mom and dad having remember when moments with your cousins staring at this guy with your favorite music

42
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,440
you know and hanging out with that one person or that one friend who you really care about

43
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,720
getting a genuine smile from a stranger and a lot of small things which we don't even notice can

44
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,520
make you so happy unknowingly okay I know most of y'all are thinking why is this girl sounding

45
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,320
like a gyanibaba or someone like that but to be honest we are forgetting that we were made to

46
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,400
interact with each other help each other and by interacting I don't mean interact by sending

47
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,760
memes just really interact in person you know and lastly I want to say that happiness doesn't mean

48
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,280
that you have to be happy all the time I mean who is happy 24 7365 that's not possible right

49
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:25,840
but to find joy and to be alive in the moment and I know it's not as easy as it sounds or

50
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,200
as easy as it looks but is it really that hard to just give it a try
