0	5360	Hey everyone, this is Purva and I'm really sure you all are wondering what is this audition
5360	12160	doing but a few months ago I had written this small article on how social media is affecting
12160	18160	us especially the youth and a lot of people suggested me that I should video record it
19360	23280	but I was feeling really shy to come in front of the camera and say all that
23840	29840	but I think I gave it a try so let me know if you like it and let's go
30560	36800	okay tell me one thing do you ever stand in front of a mirror and ask yourself who you really are
37440	46560	you know I feel a lot of people make themselves out to be someone they're not and how scary it is
46560	51360	when you pretend to be something you're not and then eventually you start becoming that person
52080	57280	and then have the audacity to say I'm just being myself I mean who are you kidding here
57280	64880	why are we neglecting or rejecting originality the reason why most of us are like this is only us
64880	71040	we are the main culprits here you know in my generation especially in my generation every
71040	76880	single thing is a joke to us we make memes about everything and I know some of you all don't even
76880	84000	know what a meme is it's basically a joke but yeah everything is a joke to us and you know for
84000	89600	example it's funny how we encourage the thought of how people get bored after socializing for two
89600	95520	hours and how they need their space isn't it actually funny how social media is making us
95520	102320	anti-social so a few months back I was having coffee in Starbucks and I saw a group of friends
102320	107920	entering probably of my age they gave their order found a comfortable place to settle down
107920	113840	and nothing they were nicely chit chatting laughing as soon as their order arrived everybody took out
113840	119520	their phones within a second and everybody was taking pictures of their coffee their food they
119520	125760	were not bothered about tasting it you know I just finished my coffee and came outside
126720	134320	and while I was waiting for my driver to pick me up I saw two older men having a small cup of tea
134320	139440	and you know laughing their heart out they were giving each other high fives they were basically
139440	147920	enjoying the moment and they were not bothered about the place the food the environment nothing
147920	155360	they were just in the moment and I just stood there wondering why can't we all be this easy going
155840	161040	well most of them out there go to good-looking places eat good-looking food just because their
161040	167120	instagram story needs to be perfect you know even on birthdays some people are so concerned about
167120	173840	recording the cake cutting part that they forget to actually genuinely sing for the person who is
173840	179920	celebrating his day or you know clap for him nothing they just bothered about taking a video
180000	186640	putting it on social media as soon as possible that's it you know and I really can't blame anyone
186640	192160	here or you know there's no offense to anyone because sometimes somewhere even I have done this
192160	198960	and it makes me so sad that we don't even notice this why is the need of showing off so strong
198960	205600	in our generation why I mean we are forgetting to live in the moment you know all we can think
205600	212560	about is how can I look flawless on social media so that other people won't judge why is the definition
212560	220160	of enjoyment or happiness dependent on such materialistic things why some of you all don't
220160	226240	even know how much effort we have to put in before posting a picture on instagram you know editing it
226240	232960	giving it a good caption so everybody will think how cool I am and then asking others for their
232960	239200	approval posting on weekends so that more people can see it you know not repeating the same clothes
240000	246400	and the list goes on do you ever just think is it really worth it is doing all this stuff
246400	253440	just for one post is it really worth it you know sometimes being just the way you are waking up
253440	260880	and admiring the sunset before checking your phone or you know looking at an old photo album with your
260880	268160	mom and dad having remember when moments with your cousins staring at this guy with your favorite music
268160	273440	you know and hanging out with that one person or that one friend who you really care about
274160	280720	getting a genuine smile from a stranger and a lot of small things which we don't even notice can
280720	287520	make you so happy unknowingly okay I know most of y'all are thinking why is this girl sounding
287600	294320	like a gyanibaba or someone like that but to be honest we are forgetting that we were made to
294320	300400	interact with each other help each other and by interacting I don't mean interact by sending
300400	307760	memes just really interact in person you know and lastly I want to say that happiness doesn't mean
308400	315280	that you have to be happy all the time I mean who is happy 24 7365 that's not possible right
315840	325840	but to find joy and to be alive in the moment and I know it's not as easy as it sounds or
325840	331200	as easy as it looks but is it really that hard to just give it a try
