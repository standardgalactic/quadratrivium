1. **Mid-journey Bias**: An example of AI bias was found in the application mid-journey, which showed older people predominantly in professions like plumbers or electricians, whereas younger people were shown more often in tech-related roles.
   
2. **Predictive Policing and Racial Profiling**: Predictive policing tools can reinforce racial profiling by relying on historical data that may have already been biased. This could lead to disproportionate targeting of minority communities.

3. **Commerce-Driven Algorithms**: These algorithms shape our consumer behavior by reinforcing our choices and preferences, potentially leading us away from new or diverse experiences. They can influence life decisions based on what we're most likely to buy or engage with.

4. **Societal Implications**: The overarching concern is that these algorithms could be used inappropriately in law enforcement to make predictions about criminal behavior or in other significant life decisions, which could have a profound impact on individuals and society.

5. **Creative Stagnation**: If we let algorithms dictate our content consumption without exposing ourselves to new and diverse perspectives, we may stifle personal growth and creativity.

6. **GreyJay App**: A recommendation for an alternative YouTube experience provided by the GreyJay app, created by Louis Rossman, which aims to avoid the typical YouTube algorithm.

7. **Book Recommendation**: "Hello World" by Hannah Fry, which explores the implications of algorithms in various aspects of life, from GPS to mass surveillance and predictive analytics.

8. **Human-Algorithm Interaction**: A study by Maya Shankar suggests that people are more satisfied with algorithms when they have some input into them, indicating a preference for autonomy even if it's over more efficient alternatives.

9. **Egocentric Satisfaction**: People seem to value their own contributions to decision-making processes, even if it doesn't necessarily lead to the best outcome.

10. **Post-AI Age**: The discussion raises questions about how much control we truly have in a world increasingly influenced by AI and whether our satisfaction with algorithms that involve our input suggests a pre-deterministic future.
