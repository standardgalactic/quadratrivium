1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,640
Timu is everywhere, promising that you can shop like a billionaire buying $10 wireless

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:16,680
speakers, $12 sneakers, $20 drones, and other unbelievably cheap electronics, gadgets, clothes,

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,600
all backed with the promise of free shipping, 90 day returns, 30 day price adjustments,

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,520
and deliveries within 2 weeks.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,980
But Timu isn't the first to sell generic, unbranded low quality mass produced Chinese

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,780
products online at radically low prices.

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:35,100
Before Timu there was AliExpress and Wish, who both went to market decades ago with the

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,620
exact same value prop, wacky advertisements, incredibly low prices, counterfeit goods,

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,260
and shady sales tactics.

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,260
It all begs the question, how exactly do these companies stay alive selling 5-10 dollar items

11
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,440
online, and how can this business model be sustainable?

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:54,460
In this episode we'll cover the business of selling cheap, Chinese made junk online

13
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,500
through Wish, AliExpress, and Timu, and how all of this ties back to growth, greed,

14
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,700
and Silicon Valley.

15
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,420
If you ship things, listen up, Rolo is disrupting the shipping industry.

16
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,900

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,540
to save lots of time and lots of money.

18
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,220
Since Rolo cares about saving you time, they've asked to cut this normally 3 minute long sponsorship

19
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,860
segment as short as possible, so here are the quick bullet points.

20
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,620
More than 250,000 shippers use Rolo.

21
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,140
There are no sign up fees and no monthly fees.

22
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,300
Whenever you ship it will cost you just 5 cents.

23
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,100
Rolo's negotiated rates with top carriers saves you up to 90% off of shipping rates.

24
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,940
Get the exact same service you would get at a post office or UPS store with huge discounts

25
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,500
directly on the Rolo app.

26
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,820
You can even schedule pickups from your doorstep, so you never end up waiting in line at a post

27
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,580
office ever again.

28
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,940
Most businesses can connect all their selling channels, Amazon, eBay, Shopify, Etsy, and

29
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,740
more, to manage and ship and track all their orders from the Rolo app.

30
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,540
Rolo also has a patented, sleek thermal printer that requires no ink to print.

31
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,300
It is an Apple Airprint certified and works with all your devices.

32
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,540
Rolo is giving you a complimentary $10 ship credit with code ModernMBA1.

33
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,220
That's code ModernMBA1 for a complimentary $10 shipping credit with Rolo.

34
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:22,020
Thank you to Rolo for supporting ModernMBA and making this episode possible.

35
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,540
Wish was the earliest player in the space, and while it's been long forgotten, the

36
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,900
company was once one of Silicon Valley's darling unicorns.

37
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,180
The company was an embodiment of all of tech's hottest B2C trends at the time.

38
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,820
Fueled by the craze of Groupon, Airbnb, Uber, and Netflix, Silicon Valley in the early 2010s

39
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,580
was a period of time where every startup called itself a platform.

40
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,460
Every founder wanted to build an online platform where all you had to do was to connect two

41
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,740
parties together and then take a cut on every transaction as the middleman.

42
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,140
Since the marketplace or the platform is made entirely of software, there would be no physical

43
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,940
assets or overhead to dilute profits.

44
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,180
The platform business in theory was infinitely scalable and that you could really capture

45
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,100
any transaction at any value and naturally achieve profitability at scale with enough

46
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,220
volume.

47
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,260
At the time, the shining examples of a platform business were Uber, who was applauded for

48
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,180
being the world's largest taxi company without owning a single car or Airbnb for disrupting

49
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,340
hotels with its platform without owning a single piece of real estate.

50
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,060
Wish sold itself as a platform that democratized e-commerce by connecting overseas merchants

51
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,020
to underserved low-income consumers who couldn't afford Amazon.

52
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:35,140
On Wish, you could get clothing, electronics, household goods, and other random items online

53
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,260
delivered right to your door at absurdly low prices.

54
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,060
Shipping was free, and some items were even as low as $1.

55
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,860
Wish was basically an online dollar store or discount store, where the main draw is

56
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,260
cheap prices.

57
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,940
Like Americans who shop at a dollar tree, consumers on Wish give up quality and convenience

58
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,460
in exchange for value.

59
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,700
The cheap prices on Wish made customers willing to tolerate the long shipping times where

60
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,620
products took two to four weeks or sometimes even months to arrive.

61
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,820
While Amazon operates its own warehouses, hires couriers, and builds its own shipping

62
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,020
network to ensure fast and accurate deliveries, Wish didn't want to get involved in the

63
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,020
logistics.

64
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,220
He placed that responsibility entirely on its international sellers, so Wish could

65
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:22,140
remain that lucrative platform with juicy software margins and zero overhead.

66
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,860
The main reason why items on Wish and AliExpress are so cheap is because a vast majority of

67
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,880
its merchants are Chinese manufacturers, wholesale and distributors, and the same is true over

68
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,900
a decade later with AliExpress and now Teemu.

69
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,500
Anytime an order comes in on Wish, these overseas merchants could simply grab the item, seal

70
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,380
it in a parcel, tack it on the customer's address, and then drop it off to the Chinese

71
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,860
Postal Service.

72
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,820
Since these merchants were A, mostly based in China with a significantly lower cost

73
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,540
of living, B, own cheap, rural warehouses or factories full of these generic, unbranded,

74
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,740
non-perishable, mass-produced products, and C, outsourced distribution to subsidized state-owned

75
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,460
postal services, they could still make profits selling items for one, two, or even $10 apiece.

76
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,380
Wish made no secret to hide this reality as you could always see from your packages when

77
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,820
they arrived that your products had been shipped from someone in China.

78
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:17,260
In the 2010s and before, shipping a package from China to the United States was actually

79
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,260
cheaper than shipping the same package from the West Coast to the East Coast.

80
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,660
This abnormality, or arbitrage, depending on where you stand, was the unintended result

81
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,540
of outdated legislation.

82
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,020
Mail within a country is generally run by one single public postal service, like the

83
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,240
USPS for Americans or La Poste for the French.

84
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,060
There are, of course, faster private alternatives like FedEx or DHL, but each country typically

85
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,520
offers a subsidized, government-owned, and run public service for its people to send

86
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,920
mail from one side of the country to the other.

87
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,440
But sending mail from one country to another is a lot more complex.

88
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,480
There has to be a universal language between each country's on mailing rates, limits,

89
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,180
dimensions, addresses, items, and so forth.

90
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,820
This is where the Universal Postal Union came in.

91
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:06,100
The Universal Postal Union, or UPU for short, was designed to solve this exact problem centuries

92
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,260
ago as an international co-op where world governments would come together every few

93
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,080
years to standardize and cross-border postal services so letters from one country could

94
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,040
be mailed smoothly to another.

95
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,460
That mail would still take weeks or even months to arrive, but the existence of the UPU would

96
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,020
ensure that those letters and packages would not simply be discarded or lost in the handoff

97
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,900
between each country's postal agency.

98
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,700
In the late 1800s before the internet and during the era of snail mail, the UPU was

99
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,700
essential for encouraging entrepreneurialism and international trade.

100
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,600
By having affordable cross-border mail, businesses and individuals in one country could seek

101
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,360
out import and export opportunities with individuals and businesses in another country, which would

102
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,840
be a net positive contribution to both economies.

103
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,720
Through the UPU, governments agreed on postal subsidies to keep international mail accessible

104
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,000
and affordable for its civilians.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,140
The cost of sending mail from developing countries in the east to established countries in the

106
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,280
west was generally subsidized at the greatest levels.

107
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,020
The wealthy western countries were happy to foot the bill for these postal subsidies as

108
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,480
they had the funds to do so and they wanted to support the growth of developing countries.

109
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,540
One of these developing countries at the time was China, but once the internet took over

110
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:25,260
and email became the superior option in the 1990s, snail mail and the UPU by extension

111
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,500
became obsolete.

112
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,680
Nonetheless, the UPU and the postal subsidies of mailing from China to the west still persisted

113
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,520
and remained untouched until the 2010s.

114
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,600
Wish built their business on this abnormality, where merchants in China could tap into these

115
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,400
aggressively subsidized cross-border postal rates to ship items direct to customers in

116
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,520
the west at dirt-cheap rates.

117
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,600
But the UPU was designed for letters and not e-commerce.

118
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,020
They only regulated mail under 4.4 pounds.

119
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,000
This is precisely why products on Wish, All The Express and even Timu today are generally

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,920
simple small gadgets, trinkets, compact electronics or collapsible lightweight items that can be

121
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
stuffed into smaller packages.

122
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,040
It's these postal constraints that make it so Wish, All The Express and even Timu these

123
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,980
days in spite of their war chas, years of growth or massive advertising have never expanded

124
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:21,120
to the higher margin bigger products like furniture, home decor or appliances.

125
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,700
Like everything in life you get what you pay for.

126
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,220
Wish from its inception was intentionally hands-off in not just the logistics but also in products

127
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,540
and standards.

128
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,660
Wish was a wild west where merchants overseas were permitted to sell just about anything

129
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,340
that would fit within the 4.4 pound limit.

130
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,260
But what was most blatant was that merchants on Wish and All The Express were permitted

131
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,860
to use doctored, misleading or sometimes completely inaccurate photos and inadequate

132
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,780
product descriptions which inevitably led to huge mismatches of expectations and reality

133
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
for customers.

134
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,160
The harsh truth is that even if we wave aside the UPU and the artificially subsidized China

135
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,920
to the west mailing rates, these cheap, mostly Chinese-made, mass-produced products were

136
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,000
generally of poor quality.

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,600
Merchants on Wish and All The Express had to resort to these kind of tactics in order

138
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,360
to drive sales otherwise there would be little interest in these products in the first place.

139
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,480
Products sold on Wish and All The Express are generally non-essential, generic, low utility

140
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:21,980
novelty impulse purchases, which are no different from the random keychains, gadgets and merchandise

141
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,140
that physical retailers stock next to the candy when you check out at the aisle.

142
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,820
These products in short were never good enough to stand out on their own, and the lack of

143
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,820
branding on Wish and All The Express made it even more obvious that these products were

144
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,580
not really designed to last and that the merchants themselves were not in it for the long haul.

145
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,980
At the core, sellers on Wish and All The Express are flippers.

146
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,460
There are people who are just looking to move on as much volume of whatever product they

147
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,240
got their hands on as quickly as possible and as anonymously as possible, as their focus

148
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,720
is not in building a brand or forging long-term relationships with customers.

149
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,520
As a result, Wish could not build a platform with the same shopping experience of Amazon

150
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,240
or eBay where people visit with clear purchase intent and are looking to research multiple

151
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,520
brands at a time.

152
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,600
If customers did that on Wish, it would only reveal the low utility of the products being

153
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,280
sold, the questionable quality, and their short-lived availability on the platform.

154
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,140
But this is not a new problem.

155
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,300
Dollar stores and discount stores all around the world had solved this decades ago by turning

156
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,940
their shopping experiences into entertaining, unpredictable treasure hunts where customers

157
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:31,220
will happily wander shelves and dig through inventory to look for deals.

158
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,540
This is in contrast from traditional supermarkets where customers usually go in with a clear

159
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,340
to-do list and in search of a specific brand.

160
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:43,180
Wish copied the dollar store playbook by making their shopping experience also discovery-based.

161
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:47,920
When customers landed on Wish.com, they were immediately thrown into a never-ending, always-changing

162
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,320
feed of random cheap products of various categories to entice endless scrolling and impulsive

163
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
purchases.

164
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,240
But in Silicon Valley, saying that you want to build an online dollar store just isn't

165
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
sexy.

166
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,680
To get that billion-dollar unicorn valuation, you need buzzwords and a greater noble purpose

167
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,240
to show that you're not just doing it for the money.

168
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,560
Wish pitched itself as a disruptive startup selling affordable products to underserved

169
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,900
low-income populations who were too poor to either afford a computer or use Amazon.

170
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,940
Wish bragged about its uniquely mobile first and discovery-based shopping experience that

171
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,660
was built on a mode of proprietary data science capabilities.

172
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,820
The company boasted about harvesting millions of data points every day to fuel, store optimization

173
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,300
and personalization so that platform would always be adapting and present only the most

174
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,380
engaging, interesting and relevant products that had the highest likelihood to purchase

175
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,500
based on each user's interests.

176
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,000
And just like every platform startup of the 2010s, Wish boasted about having network effects

177
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,080
like Facebook, where the more users, the more data points on its platform, the stronger

178
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,760
its underlying data science would become, which in turn would translate to a better

179
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,720
shopping experience, stronger sales for merchants, and over time, organically bring in more

180
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,280
new users and merchants to the platform.

181
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,440
As we covered in the Under Armour episode earlier this season, data is not a moat, and

182
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,160
by itself, it can't make up for product quality.

183
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,660
The data science, proprietary algorithms, and shopping personalization that Wish bragged

184
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,140
about was fundamentally not any different from what Amazon and eBay had already accomplished

185
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,260
for their own platforms decades ago.

186
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,720
To dance around the inherent issues of product quality, slow snail mail delivery, and dodgy

187
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,300
sales tactics, Wish spun that the problem was you and not them.

188
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:34,780
Quote, while e-commerce grew from 3% of global commerce in 2010 to 14% in 2019, e-commerce

189
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,560
companies have largely focused on serving affluent customers by offering branded goods

190
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,240
and prioritizing convenience over price.

191
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,840
However, 44% of the United States and 85% of Europeans have a household income of less

192
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:53,280
than $75,000 and cannot afford many traditional e-commerce offerings.

193
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,680
Wish's point is that while you and I might think the products on their platform are inferior,

194
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,360
cheap, and crappy, we are actually blinded by privilege, and that the products being sold

195
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,700
are affordable, useful, and acceptable for low-income Americans and Europeans.

196
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,620
Silicon Valley ate up this story, and Wish skyrocketed into a multi-billion-dollar unicorn

197
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:17,900
in less than a decade, yet that same $10 billion private valuation would melt like a hot knife

198
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,140
through butter under the scrutiny of the public markets.

199
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,820
Like most, if not all, tech IPOs, Wish was essentially nothing more than a pump and dump.

200
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:31,340
Wish's valuation has dropped more than 99% since its IPO in 2020, but the venture capitalists

201
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,960
and founders have all made out with their riches, laughing their way to the bank as

202
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,480
the company burns.

203
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,800
The only thing keeping Wish from being delisted on the Nasdaq these days as a penny stock

204
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,320
has been a 30-to-1 reverse split.

205
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,440
While some of the company's decline in valuation can be attributed to the current recession,

206
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,400
the realities that Wish's numbers at IPO and even today are abysmal.

207
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,080
It's not a case of that the company just needs more time to execute, it's more so

208
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,760
that the numbers themselves are so bad that they just can't be improved.

209
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,500
No change in leadership or strategy could hide the reality that there was simply no

210
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,060
real business model.

211
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,420
For a platform startup that didn't own any warehouses, didn't handle any logistics,

212
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,580
didn't have any physical assets, and didn't really provide anything but software, Wish

213
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,700
was entirely unsustainable.

214
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,300
Like most tech pump and dumps, Wish had deflected concerns around sustainability by focusing

215
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,380
on top-line growth and promising that profits would naturally come over time.

216
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,960
The company had done just that in private, growing revenue from $144 million in 2015

217
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,680
to $1.9 billion at IPO.

218
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,640
Like Amazon, Wish makes its money as a platform by taking a 10-to-20% commission from the

219
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,680
merchants off every purchase.

220
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:45,280
The inherent challenge here is that taking commission off the sale of a $5-to-10 product

221
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,200
is a whole different ballgame than taking commission off a $40-to-60 product.

222
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,040
Contrary to Amazon, Wish needed to make up for its poor unit economics with sheer volume.

223
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,100
The VCs, Wish likely compared its trajectory to Amazon, where Jeff Bezos famously gave

224
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,180
up profits to reinvest into his platform.

225
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,100
And after enough years of investment, Wish believed that its own operating margins would

226
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,740
turn positive just like it did for Amazon.

227
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,780
The distinction here is that with Amazon, you could actually see the literal physical

228
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:18,580
output of what that money was going towards in the warehouses, distribution centers, and

229
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,140
offices that were popping up around the country.

230
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,600
Wish was just a software platform, which meant that all the hundreds of millions of

231
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,360
dollars that the startup was spending beyond its means wasn't going towards any capital

232
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,280
expenditures or long live assets.

233
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,880
Since 2015, Wish had posted hundreds of millions of dollars in operating losses, and these

234
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,760
losses were not improving.

235
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,320
Wish burned millions of dollars on basic operating expenses to keep its platform running.

236
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,600
While one might think that a self-proclaimed data science company would meant that the

237
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,120
company would naturally spend big on engineers, R&D made up less than 5% of annual revenue

238
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,700
and accounted for no more than 5% of operating expenses every year.

239
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,100
Companies will always invest the most in whatever they believe will lead to the highest returns.

240
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,300
If Wish had truly believed that algorithms and data science and personalization would

241
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,780
directly unlock greater spend and other business efficiencies on the platform, the company would

242
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,340
easily have put its money where its mouth was.

243
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,460
Despite being engineers themselves and openly declaring data to be its competitive advantage,

244
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,100
Wish's founders both knew enough not to overinvest in R&D.

245
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,760
But Wish, Peter Skowiski and Danny Zhang knew what Kevin at Under Armour didn't know,

246
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,080
which was that data science cannot unlock any substantial innovation or business value

247
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,600
and at best only generates marginal improvements.

248
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,560
Wish burned the most money every year in sales and marketing, which alone cost 70 to 90%

249
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,880
of annual revenue.

250
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,320
That means that for every $1 that Wish earned in revenue, the company was burning 70 to

251
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,280
90 cents of that dollar on sales and marketing alone.

252
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,380
The numbers get even wilder when we segment out the advertising costs, which made up over

253
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,500
90% of the entire sales and marketing expense.

254
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,980
Wish had to spend so much on advertising because convincing low income consumers who are just

255
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,580
surviving to buy non-essential goods with their already little disposable income is

256
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,620
a predictably difficult endeavor.

257
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,100
The poor make for low quality customers in that they're low earners, they're tiny

258
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,940
spenders, they don't have the room and time for brand loyalty, they generally live extreme

259
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,400
lifestyles and are by nature just high churned users.

260
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,000
This was why Amazon and other e-commerce platforms before Wish had never bothered to chase the

261
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,280
low income market in the first place.

262
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,640
Wish had to regularly spend big to reach and capture this fickle audience, but the truth

263
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,960
was that these customers were worth very little.

264
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,440
At IPO, Wish tried to show off that their platform had stickiness and that their customers

265
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,680
were increasing their spend over time, pointing out that the average lifetime value of their

266
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,780
users had grown from $10 to $30 in revenue by year 4.

267
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,220
A $30 LTV per user is depressingly low.

268
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,780
If we assume that Wish took a 15% commission, that means that a user spent on average just

269
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,420
$50 per year on the platform.

270
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,540
Wish had to keep spending big on advertising to constantly pull in new users to replace

271
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:05,980
those that had churned, and even as the number of active buyers grew from 18 million in 2015

272
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:11,660
to 62 million by 2019, the company was not getting any closer to profitability.

273
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,080
Looking at Wish's financials, there was still some merit to the whole platform idea.

274
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,920
Wish's initial gross margins were high, especially in comparison to Amazon, as its

275
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,720
cost of revenue was really just the cost of hosting software.

276
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,000
But all those gross profits were chewed up by advertising, and at the time of IPO, there

277
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,720
were plenty of signs that Wish's growth strategy of burning billions annually on online ads

278
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,240
was at a point of diminishing returns.

279
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,300
Despite spending $3 billion in three consecutive years on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and

280
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,780
YouTube ads, the number of active buyers on Wish plateaued from 2018 and 2020.

281
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,900
Wish was burning more cash than it was generating every year, with net cash from operating activities

282
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,620
and free cash flow both in the negatives.

283
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,020
As we covered before in the Uber and Open Door episodes, unprofitable tech startups

284
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,900
typically used adjusted EBITDA as a way to positively spin numbers that look horrific

285
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,840
under generally accepted accounting principles.

286
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,680
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins are generally quite dangerous, non-regulated,

287
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,960
untrustworthy metrics as each company comes up with its own definition, and they get

288
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,080
to cherry pick whatever numbers that will make their losses look better and their margins

289
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,080
fatter.

290
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,480
But Wish's base numbers were so rough that the company had no room to even maneuver.

291
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,960
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins, metrics that Wish pushed as more accurate

292
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,300
representations of their business were just as bleak as the actual underlying numbers.

293
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,900
Even by the company's own charitable definition, Wish was losing money on every transaction

294
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,060
and nowhere close to profitability, despite being a software-only platform without the

295
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,100
costs and overhead and logistics of Amazon.

296
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,940
At IPO, Wish was led by its founder and CEO Peter Skowiski.

297
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,380
Peter's tenure was constantly overshadowed by news that were somehow even worse than

298
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,880
the company's numbers.

299
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,420
At the time of IPO, Donald Trump was the president of the United States, and he had designated

300
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,300
China as public enemy number one to the American economy.

301
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,580
His economic policy was built on the belief that other countries, most notably China,

302
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,700
had taken advantage of these historic trade policies and flooded the markets with cheap

303
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,540
imports at the expense of American businesses.

304
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:22,220
Trump's trade war extended not just to the import of Chinese goods into the US by freight,

305
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,700
but also to the same generously subsidized postal rates of mail sent from China to the

306
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,080
United States.

307
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,240
The US threatened to quit the UPU unless the China to US postal rates were changed.

308
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,400
Under intense political pressure, the rates were reformed and the average cost of shipping

309
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,600
mail and packages from China to the United States increased 50% overnight, threatening

310
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,720
Wish's entire business.

311
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,520
Chinese merchants could no longer maintain their same margins without raising prices

312
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,120
or now charging for shipping, both of which hurt Wish's ability to compete on cost as

313
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,640
a platform.

314
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,260
With such headwinds, Peter focused on involving Wish to be a platform that was less China

315
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:06,980
dependent to carry products with greater utility and to drive retention from existing users.

316
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,380
Under Peter, Wish expanded product categories, briefly experimented with bigger and more

317
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,660
expensive products like furniture and branded electronics, and recruited merchants based

318
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,020
in Latin America and Eastern Europe to reduce their reliance on China.

319
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,060
Business is fair in that you are generally compensated based on the value that you create.

320
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,680
If you want to make more money, you have to create more value, and you create greater

321
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,920
value by solving bigger problems.

322
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:34,400
When you pick only the easy problems to solve, you create and capture much less value.

323
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,560
Thus, if Wish wanted to stay as a passive, software-only platform with zero involvement

324
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,760
in logistics and product quality, the business performance in the shopping experience would

325
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,760
remain just as terrible as ever.

326
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,920
The company needed to create more value for its users and for its merchants in order to

327
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,600
have any chance of achieving profitability.

328
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:57,220
As a direct response to the postal changes, Wish began operating warehouses on its own

329
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:02,540
and taking on responsibility for first-mile collection and last-mile delivery.

330
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,460
Logistics quickly became fast-growing supplemental revenue streams where merchants would pay

331
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,500
to outsource delivery to Wish as the platform.

332
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,060
This greater control in turn helped cut down average delivery times from months into weeks

333
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,900
as Wish began storing more and more product inventory locally in its own warehouses.

334
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,320
Later even took a page from Western Union and partnered with local brick-and-mortar businesses

335
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,640
to serve as makeshift fulfillment centers so shipments could be batched and customers

336
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:31,160
could pick up the orders themselves to save on shipping costs.

337
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,600
Merchants could now also pay Wish for advertising services so that their products would be promoted

338
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,880
ahead of others on the platform.

339
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,780
These new revenue streams were all-in-truth table stakes for any modern online marketplace

340
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:47,460
and Wish was years late in this implementation, but late is certainly better than never.

341
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:53,240
By evolving beyond just one flat sales commission income stream, Wish surpassed $2 billion combined

342
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,920
in revenue in 2020 yet remained just as far from profitability as before.

343
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:04,360
Wish's gross margins declined dramatically as its cost of doing business skyrocketed with

344
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,560
the increased overhead and involvement in logistics.

345
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,000
Wish's margins have since continuously declined year-over-year resembling those much closer

346
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,640
to that of Amazon.

347
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,140
Wish's new gross margins, interestingly enough, as an e-commerce platform, are generally

348
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,380
lower than when you compared to the gross margins of product manufacturers and dedicated

349
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,540
wholesalers, meaning that you would probably make more money selling clothes on Wish than

350
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,540
you would operating Wish itself as a platform.

351
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:34,460
The IPO had shined a light on the various skeletons hiding in Wish's closet, the poor user

352
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:39,020
retention, the insane advertising spend, and the weak customer lifetime value.

353
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:43,060
At the same time, the era of cheap online advertising had come to an end.

354
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,880
B2C startups as well as thousands of other legacy brands flooded social media and drove

355
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,400
advertising costs online to record levels as demand exceeded supply.

356
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,880
These headwinds forced Wish to move away from its historic, reckless mindset of acquiring

357
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,120
users at any cost and towards a more sustainable approach of retention and expansion.

358
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,480
From 2019 onwards, the company dramatically cut back on its ad budget, yet it couldn't

359
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,320
afford to turn off the spigot.

360
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,320
Without the crutch of advertising to combat churn, Wish was compelled to take the first-ever

361
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,100
steps to clean up the wild west of a marketplace that it had created.

362
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,740
It was only in 2021 when Wish finally focused on quality.

363
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,060
They published standards for merchants to abide by, they started ranking sellers internally

364
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:28,620
based on their performance, and they incentivized merchants to think longer term with the promise

365
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,180
of low commission and priority placement for good ratings.

366
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:36,260
Wish was still the cheapest game in town, but the quality of users was still so dreadful

367
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,580
that the company had to even partner with Klarna to make its low prices and even lower

368
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,960
quality products more tolerable to customers.

369
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,840
To his credit, Peter actually seemed committed to taking on these challenges and publicly

370
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,240
admitted his past mistakes around personnel and strategy.

371
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,520
Quote, I'd like to remind everyone we're not satisfied with these results and the outlook.

372
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,200
We all know that we can do better.

373
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,240
We're taking action to improve our performance for the long term, especially with a focus

374
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,680
on enhancing the user experience and increasing retention.

375
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,320
We look forward to providing an update on our next call in November.

376
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,540
Yet Peter would never make it to November.

377
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:17,220
Instead, he was forced to resign as CEO by the board and just two months after being

378
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:21,300
pushed out, Peter resigned from the board as well and disassociated himself from his

379
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,020
own startup entirely.

380
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:28,260
In the exact same statement announcing Peter's resignation as CEO, the board publicly committed

381
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,860
to finding his successor in three months.

382
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:35,780
The speed at which Peter exited his own company and the equally hasty three month deadline

383
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,760
to find a new CEO suggests that Peter's departure was most likely unplanned, unfriendly

384
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
and chaotic.

385
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,220
But Peter needs no sympathy as he had already made out with his millions long before the

386
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,600
stock crashed.

387
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,840
Wish appointed Vijay Talwar, a former Footlocker executive to take over as the CEO of Wish

388
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,920
in January of 2022.

389
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,640
Vijay's qualifications and claim to fame was turning around Footlocker's online business

390
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,840
to become the shoe retailer's most profitable and fastest growing segment.

391
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,540
But these accomplishments seem a little overblown when we poke at the numbers.

392
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,980
Regardless, Vijay took the helm at Wish and publicly promised to turn around the sinking

393
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,980
platform.

394
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,900
Since rocket ship user growth and annual billion dollar ad spend was no longer realistic,

395
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,220
the company could no longer bet on volume alone to make up for its negative margins.

396
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,940
Vijay's first move was to lay off 15% of the company to reduce headcount and to improve

397
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,740
the chances of profitability.

398
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:33,960
His streamlining extended into geographies as Wish cut operations in 79 countries to

399
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,720
focus on better serving existing customers in North America and Western Europe.

400
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,760
Vijay's final contribution as CEO was to rebrand Wish to demonstrate to the world

401
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,360
that the platform was not the same Wild West as it was before.

402
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,160
Yet Vijay brought no vision of his own and was fired as CEO in September, less than one

403
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,520
year on the job.

404
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,680
And like Peter before, Vijay needs no sympathy as he got paid $6 million for nine months

405
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,860
of work.

406
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,420
Wish is now on its third CEO in two years in Jo Yan, a career professional who made

407
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:11,820
his name in Asia as the former general manager for Google and Stripe in mainland China.

408
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,300
Wish's business has continued to take knockout blows as the recession in the US, the war

409
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:21,900
in Ukraine, the prolonged COVID lockdown of China and inflation have all cut into discretionary

410
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,340
spending in Wish's customer base.

411
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,260
Wish had historically proclaimed itself as a mobile first platform as the only way to

412
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,560
sign up and buy things on Wish was through its mobile app.

413
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,760
Yet the company is now in a desperate state where every purchase and every user counts,

414
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,120
no matter from where, how little, or how few there are.

415
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,920
As a result, the company has had no choice but to lower the gates as customers can now

416
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,800
browse and transact on Wish without having to go through the mobile app.

417
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,720
The historic claim of Wish being a mobile first platform is now completely obsolete.

418
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,920
While Peter had relied on soft incentives to encourage better merchant behavior and

419
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,100
product standards, Joe has taken far more aggressive steps to clean up the platform

420
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,540
in banning low-rated sellers, capping the number of merchants on the platform, and providing

421
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,860
customers with quality guarantees.

422
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,060
Under Joe, Wish has tried to improve the core shopping experience by shortening delivery

423
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:15,740
times from four weeks to a target of two weeks, but this is only possible when products are

424
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,980
stored in bulk locally and not sent individually overseas.

425
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,620
The increased carrying costs of storing more product at more warehouses across North America

426
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,840
and Europe just to ship their product faster to customers' doors has only shredded the

427
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,560
company's margins.

428
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,320
Operating margins, net losses, and all the metrics by Wish's own definition have ultimately

429
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,400
only worsened over time.

430
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,200
Wish is truly an estate where they're damned if they do and damned if they don't.

431
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,720
They can't raise prices without alienating their core low-income customer base to improve

432
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,840
the unit economics, but they also can't bring in new users without modernizing the

433
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,600
platform logistics and improving the shopping experience, both of which are costly investments.

434
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:00,660
The harsh reality is that there is ultimately no magical strategy or solution to fixing

435
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,980
a business model that just simply doesn't work.

436
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:10,020
The logical question is that if Wish doesn't work as a business, then how is AliExpress

437
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
still alive?

438
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:15,900
The main difference between Wish and AliExpress is that Alibaba hasn't bothered to build

439
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,940
a big business out of AliExpress.

440
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:23,020
The main difference between Wish and AliExpress is that Alibaba hasn't bothered to build

441
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
AliExpress.

442
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,840
AliExpress was created around the same time as Wish to extend the core Alibaba platform

443
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,920
to help Chinese merchants sell directly to customers in other countries.

444
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,360
Wish targeted low-income households in prime consumer markets like North America where

445
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,400
e-commerce and product standards are all well-established, but AliExpress in contrast since its inception

446
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,520
has targeted emerging markets like Russia, Spain, and Brazil where e-commerce is limited

447
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,720
and product standards as a whole are underdeveloped.

448
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,580
AliExpress historically accounts for less than 5% of all of Alibaba's revenue and

449
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,940
strategically has taken a backseat compared to the company's other ventures like cloud

450
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,940
computing and entertainment.

451
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,220
But despite the minimal investment, AliExpress has come up with the exact same roadmap as

452
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:13,060
Wish over the same period of time, evolving from a Wild West marketplace with a flat

453
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:18,180
commission model into a gradually curated, localized, improved shopping experience that

454
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:21,140
provides logistics to merchants for a fee.

455
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,520
AliExpress's current goal, just like Wish, has been to shorten delivery times from weeks

456
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:30,360
into days and the solution is the same in needing to store more product locally on demand

457
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,880
rather than distributing one at a time from overseas.

458
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,200
Despite operating for the same amount of time and at a much smaller scale, AliExpress, just

459
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:42,360
like Wish, has never turned a profit, but it's of no concern to Alibaba as they enjoy

460
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,200
plenty of profits and cash flow from its other income streams to indefinitely subsidize

461
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,400
this B2C venture.

462
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:55,220
The most prevalent question is that if all of this is well known and public information,

463
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,420
then why does Timu even exist?

464
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:01,900
Why would any company throw in so much good money after the bad to chase a business model

465
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,740
that past companies have already proven to be largely unsustainable?

466
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,900
Timu is the latest venture from the Chinese e-commerce giant Pingdo-Do.

467
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:15,300
Pingdo-Do, or PDD for short, was founded in 2015 and is one of the strangest modern day

468
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,300
businesses.

469
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:21,440
If their numbers are to be trusted, this tiny startup somehow grew from zero to one of China's

470
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,320
biggest online retailers in just three years.

471
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,280
PDD gained popularity in China for its group purchase model where customers can pull in

472
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,280
friends and family into their orders so that they can increase the order quantities and

473
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,760
then collectively unlock greater savings.

474
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,040
PDD's success as a platform in China, if real, is as much a product of culture as it

475
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,560
is of technology.

476
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,780
While shopping is generally a solitary, personal, individualistic, and highly efficient activity

477
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,220
in the West, shopping in China is a more communal and social activity that's built

478
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:57,420
on the same collectivism and cultural isolationism of modern Chinese society.

479
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:02,980
The point here is that PDD as a platform in its design can only be successful in China.

480
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,780
As PDD has scaled, the company has followed the same predictable growth playbook of other

481
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,220
established e-commerce companies around the world.

482
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,400
They've used data to improve their product recommendations, to personalize the shopping

483
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,200
experience for users, to build out their own warehouses, to construct their own distribution

484
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,160
centers, to provide logistics to merchants for a fee, to sell its own private label goods

485
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,720
on its marketplace like Amazon Basics, and even rolling out a grocery delivery service

486
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,720
like Instacart.

487
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,240
PDD's main challenge these days is that the company has hit a ceiling in terms of what

488
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,200
it can accomplish by operating in China alone.

489
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,100
The only way to sustain its historic double or triple digit growth is to go overseas,

490
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,620
but the core group purchase platform is simply not translatable to the West.

491
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:50,620
More than that, it would only be foolish to go head-to-head against Amazon in its home

492
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:55,060
court competing for the same users, and especially as a foreign brand.

493
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,820
PDD has reaped millions of dollars year over year from the American equity markets, where

494
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:06,180
the company's rapid rise and impressive, non-regulated financials have painted the

495
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,280
pictures of an unstoppable, fast-growing tech rocket ship in the world's second-largest

496
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,280
economy.

497
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,160
Even though no American can even access PDD, it hasn't stopped retail investors from diving

498
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:22,840
in head-first and propelling Pindodo's valuation to even higher than that of Alibaba in less

499
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,040
than three years.

500
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:29,720
PDD's insane growth has fueled its radical valuation on the American equity markets,

501
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,140
which is in turn enable the company to sell shares at spectacular premiums, enriching

502
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,040
both shareholders and insiders alike.

503
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,240
But with their core platform now plateauing in China, the only way to keep up growth is

504
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,240
to enter the U.S.

505
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,200
But with Amazon firmly entrenched in the middle and upper end of the market, PDD's best

506
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,640
bet is at the bottom.

507
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,120
Quote, as we reach our current scale, investors should not expect us to continuously deliver

508
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,120
high growth.

509
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,840
As our user base reaches its current scale, our focus now is on how to serve our existing

510
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:03,560
880 million Chinese users and how to improve their trust and mind share.

511
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:07,460
Our team has started out roughly half a year ago, and given the early stage nature, the

512
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,500
financial impact from this business is relatively small.

513
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,820
We are entering new markets, so we need to understand customers.

514
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:18,420
Our team is laser focused on understanding and accepting different cultural preferences,

515
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:23,220
social environments, and consumer demand with the aim of creating more unique value.

516
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:28,300
Timu is young, experimental, and unproven, but that hasn't stopped PDD from promoting

517
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,140
it everywhere it can, even at the Super Bowl.

518
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,960
Like with Aliexpress and Alibaba, Timu only works today because it's subsidized by a

519
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,560
mature core business.

520
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:42,200
Timu's existence is fundamentally borne out of PDD's urgency to maintain its double

521
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,560
digit growth and to keep up its equity valuations.

522
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:51,000
In business, cost, quality, and speed are traditionally presented in the form of a triangle

523
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,120
where companies can realistically only achieve two of these things at a time.

524
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,320
No business can achieve all three, yet Timu is burning millions of dollars to challenge

525
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:04,780
this age-old paradigm by offering customers unprecedented speed, price, and value, promising

526
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:10,740
generous 90-day refunds, 30-day price adjustments, free shipping, and delivery within two weeks

527
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,380
or less to squash its weakening rivals.

528
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,660
Wish is a tale of not just another Silicon Valley pump and dump, but also a real-world

529
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,800
reminder that the software platform business is a myth and that online businesses are

530
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,620
not any more advantageous than traditional brick-and-mortar ones.

531
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,280
In business, we are all compensated based on the value that we generate.

532
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,720
When you operate as a software-only platform like Wish and like how many other startups

533
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,520
do, you're really only solving the easy problems.

534
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,000
Building a website and facilitating a transaction between two parties is ultimately not that

535
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,880
difficult, especially when the transaction is worth less than a meal at McDonald's.

536
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,880
Selling cheap Chinese junk is actually a proven business in every part of the world, whether

537
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,840
that's the mighty dollar store or the random peddlers that sell cheap souvenirs at tourist

538
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,740
destinations.

539
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,380
But when you try to do the same thing exclusively online, where visitors can leave just as fast

540
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:06,100
with a click of a button, where customers can't touch and feel what they're buying

541
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,660
and they have no intent or pressure to splurge, the work you have to do to build up that trust

542
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,420
and urgency virtually is monumental.

543
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,900
Only time will tell if Timu will be sustainable or if he'll be another flash in the pan,

544
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,660
but if the results of AliExpress and Wish are anything to go off of, the odds are completely

545
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,060
stacked against Timu.
