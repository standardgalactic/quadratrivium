00:00.000 --> 00:10.480
Screaming on roller coasters, getting splashed on log rides, ramming friends in bumper cars,

00:10.480 --> 00:15.200
and riding on carousels with family are treasured memories for those who grew up in the 2000s

00:15.200 --> 00:16.200
and earlier.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.760
The amusement park just like the shopping mall and movie theater was once a seemingly

00:19.760 --> 00:23.680
indispensable establishment for every major metropolitan.

00:23.680 --> 00:27.600
In the eras before the internet and where availability mattered above all else, the

00:27.600 --> 00:31.440
amusement park thrived as a provider of affordable recreation.

00:31.440 --> 00:36.200
People of all ages could have fun at the park for an entire day which is $20-$30 and within

00:36.200 --> 00:38.960
a 1-2 hour drive from their homes.

00:38.960 --> 00:44.080
Yet fast forward to the present and amusement parks are a dying breed in the modern age.

00:44.080 --> 00:47.960
In the past amusement parks were defined by their rides like how fast a certain roller

00:47.960 --> 00:51.200
coaster traveled or how steep a drop tower was.

00:51.200 --> 00:55.380
Nowadays what matters most for an amusement park is intellectual property.

00:55.380 --> 00:59.060
With the emergence of the Disney adult, consumers around the world have shown a preference

00:59.060 --> 01:04.540
for IP based theme parks like Universal Studios and Disneyland where the branded attractions,

01:04.540 --> 01:09.660
concessions, and merchandise have fueled above average spending and immense popularity.

01:09.660 --> 01:13.500
Consumers have shown an insatiable appetite to immerse themselves in their favorite media

01:13.500 --> 01:18.780
franchises, paying without hesitation for $9 butter beer from Harry Potter, $10 pink

01:18.780 --> 01:24.860
sprinkle donuts from The Simpsons, $12 Mario Strawberry Soda from Nintendo, $15 meat on

01:24.860 --> 01:30.660
the bone from One Piece, $8 Blue Milk from Star Wars, and $7 Cheesecake Orbs from the

01:30.660 --> 01:32.780
Marvel Cinematic Universe.

01:32.780 --> 01:37.040
Beyond rides and concessions, the IPs come to life at these parks where visitors get to

01:37.040 --> 01:41.660
mingle shoulder to shoulder with bubbly costume performers who behave just like their big

01:41.660 --> 01:43.980
screen blockbuster equivalents.

01:43.980 --> 01:48.540
While park goers soak up this magical atmosphere, underneath every costume is a blue collar

01:48.540 --> 01:53.300
worker who's sweating buckets and being paid minimum wage to entertain thousands of strangers

01:53.300 --> 01:54.540
every day.

01:54.540 --> 01:59.300
The themed foods, branded attractions, exclusive merchandise, and trademark characters have

01:59.300 --> 02:04.180
elevated experiences and expectations to the point where conventional amusement parks can

02:04.180 --> 02:08.660
no longer compete with their generic foods, mascots, and rides.

02:08.660 --> 02:14.460
When customers want Space Mountain, The Avengers Campus, The Millennium Falcon, Diagon Alley,

02:14.460 --> 02:20.020
Minions, and Elsa, having the fastest roller coaster is suddenly a lot less relevant.

02:20.020 --> 02:24.520
While the local park will always be more convenient and affordable with admissions and run-of-the-mill

02:24.720 --> 02:29.480
concessions, compared to Disney and Universal, who charge two to five times more for entry

02:29.480 --> 02:32.660
alone, customers ultimately vote with their wallet.

02:32.660 --> 02:37.360
In this day and age, customers have demonstrated through their spend, attendance, and virality

02:37.360 --> 02:41.480
that they'd rather make a special trip to Disney and Universal than go to the basic

02:41.480 --> 02:43.320
regional amusement park.

02:43.320 --> 02:46.720
In this episode, we'll cover the business of roller coasters through the lens of Six

02:46.720 --> 02:51.120
Flags, the largest operator of amusement parks in the world, and the many strategies

02:51.120 --> 02:55.720
that the company has employed to survive, differentiate itself, and to capture whatever

02:55.720 --> 02:58.840
share that remains in this ultra-competitive market.

03:01.200 --> 03:05.640
For older generations, the amusement park was a unique place of happiness and entertainment

03:05.640 --> 03:07.840
in a time where mental health was taboo.

03:07.840 --> 03:12.520
And this episode is sponsored by BetterHelp, the leader in affordable, accessible online

03:12.520 --> 03:13.520
therapy.

03:13.520 --> 03:18.600
In my early 20s, I grinded after graduation, like many of my peers, working long hours,

03:18.600 --> 03:23.000
appeasing my bosses, coming in on weekends, and ignoring personal obligations just so

03:23.000 --> 03:26.040
I could be the highest performer in corporate America.

03:26.040 --> 03:31.000
I worked like this for years, always stressed, irritable, impatient, and cranky, but when

03:31.000 --> 03:35.040
my products were randomly killed off and my engineering teams were fired, did I realize

03:35.040 --> 03:36.040
I needed help?

03:36.040 --> 03:40.400
I wanted to become a better person and to still work hard, but no longer at the expense

03:40.400 --> 03:43.280
of family, friends, and my own mental health.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.840
I went to therapy.

03:44.840 --> 03:48.720
Being a non-judgmental professional and a safe environment was cathartic and healing

03:48.720 --> 03:49.720
for me.

03:49.720 --> 03:53.960
Just talking about my problems and recognizing them out loud was profound.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.920
Therapy is beneficial for everyone, even 20-year-old dudes like me, and BetterHelp's

03:57.920 --> 04:01.240
mission is to make therapy more affordable and accessible.

04:01.240 --> 04:05.480
BetterHelp is a platform that makes finding a therapist easier as it's fully online

04:05.480 --> 04:06.720
and remote.

04:06.720 --> 04:10.920
By just filling out a few questions, BetterHelp can match you to a professional therapist

04:10.920 --> 04:14.760
in as little as a few days, and if you don't click with your matched therapist, you can

04:14.760 --> 04:19.320
easily switch to a new one at no additional cost without stressing about insurance and

04:19.320 --> 04:20.480
networks.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.680
If you're stressed or struggling, consider BetterHelp.

04:23.680 --> 04:27.680
Therapy was invaluable for me and my times of need, and when you visit betterhelp.com

04:27.680 --> 04:32.280
slash MBA, you can get 10% off your first month of therapy.

04:32.280 --> 04:36.800
Mental health is just as important as physical health, and online therapy is one of the cheapest,

04:36.800 --> 04:39.920
easiest, and most effective ways to take care of yourself.

04:39.920 --> 04:44.120
Like going to the gym or having a good diet, it doesn't hurt to try therapy.

04:44.120 --> 04:50.960
Thank you to BetterHelp for supporting Modern MBA and making this episode possible.

04:50.960 --> 04:55.520
To understand the business of amusement parks, we can draw from Roller Coaster Tycoon.

04:55.520 --> 04:59.480
For people who aren't familiar, Roller Coaster Tycoon is a popular simulation game where

04:59.480 --> 05:02.120
you can build and manage your own amusement park.

05:02.120 --> 05:06.960
You choose which rides go where, what types of rides to offer, where to place footpaths

05:06.960 --> 05:11.760
to direct visitors from one attraction to the next, where to place the bathrooms, where

05:11.760 --> 05:15.960
to put concession stands to optimize food and drink sales, and how much staff to hire

05:15.960 --> 05:18.080
to keep the park running smoothly.

05:18.080 --> 05:24.080
All while maximizing profits, guest satisfaction, park appeal, property value, and ROI from

05:24.080 --> 05:26.080
the limited budget available.

05:26.080 --> 05:30.360
Just like in real life, there are consequences to poor planning and bad investments.

05:30.360 --> 05:35.040
If there aren't enough security guards, the park will become chaotic and suffer vandalism.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.360
Guests will complain about hygiene if there aren't enough bathrooms or janitors.

05:38.680 --> 05:43.040
If there are too many visitors, then guest happiness will decrease with the overcrowding.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.940
If a ride is too intense, then guests will get sick.

05:45.940 --> 05:48.880
If a ride is too fast, the chance of accidents increase.

05:48.880 --> 05:52.280
If there aren't enough handymen to perform maintenance, then the roller coasters will

05:52.280 --> 05:53.280
break down.

05:53.280 --> 05:56.480
If the prices are too high, then customers won't spend.

05:56.480 --> 06:00.680
And if the rides aren't regularly renovated, then visitors will get bored and park appeal

06:00.680 --> 06:02.400
will decrease.

06:02.400 --> 06:06.320
While Roller Coaster Tycoon nails that planning and maintenance are integral to the success

06:06.320 --> 06:10.600
of any amusement park, there are a variety of other factors outside of this video game

06:10.600 --> 06:14.960
depiction that make the overall business so uniquely difficult.

06:14.960 --> 06:18.480
The core business model of the amusement park is fairly straightforward.

06:18.480 --> 06:22.200
You pull in as many customers as you can, and you entertain them so they stay as long

06:22.200 --> 06:25.160
as possible and spend as much as possible.

06:25.160 --> 06:29.280
Once customers are inside the park, you can monetize them aggressively with high markups

06:29.280 --> 06:33.680
on food and merchandise to squeeze more dollars from entry tickets.

06:33.680 --> 06:38.800
At cruise ships, amusement parks are capital intensive businesses where continuous monetization

06:38.800 --> 06:45.160
by volume and margin are necessary to offset the huge operating costs and massive overhead.

06:45.160 --> 06:49.400
As we covered in the episode on cruises, a single cruise ship costs over half a billion

06:49.400 --> 06:50.480
dollars.

06:50.480 --> 06:54.360
And amusement parks are no different in that the construction of a single park falls in

06:54.360 --> 06:59.360
the same ballpark with costs of 400 to 800 million dollars, whereas the top of the line

06:59.360 --> 07:03.560
Disney or Universal theme park ranges in the billions.

07:03.560 --> 07:07.720
Despite comparable capital requirements to cruises, the barriers to entry are actually

07:07.720 --> 07:09.940
much higher for amusement parks.

07:09.940 --> 07:14.560
The bottleneck for amusement parks is not really just the labor, engineering or material,

07:14.560 --> 07:16.440
but rather in the land.

07:16.440 --> 07:20.240
Parks conventionally build appeal by having one or two centerpiece roller coasters that

07:20.240 --> 07:23.880
goes super fast, super high, and have maximum airtime.

07:23.880 --> 07:28.160
Even if the average visitor is too scared to ride them, these thrill rides are by design

07:28.160 --> 07:33.040
defining attractions that are super tall, super long, and super wide, so parks generally

07:33.040 --> 07:38.480
build other attractions around them to generate atmosphere, attention, and curb appeal.

07:38.480 --> 07:43.600
But to go fast and high, these roller coasters need lots of space, mile long tracks, and

07:43.600 --> 07:46.560
can eat up 5 to 10 acres by themselves.

07:46.560 --> 07:51.080
On the flip side, smaller rides like kiddie coasters are significantly more space efficient

07:51.080 --> 07:56.120
with footprints of half an acre or less, but they're also a lot less memorable to visitors.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.800
If a park has too many thrill rides, then the family business will be hard to attract

07:59.800 --> 08:04.200
and capture, whereas a park with too many kiddie coasters and not enough thrill rides

08:04.200 --> 08:08.880
will lose the teenager and adult market.

08:08.880 --> 08:12.960
While there have been innovations in recent years with space efficient vertical oriented

08:12.960 --> 08:17.640
roller coasters that don't require lift hills, trade-offs still remain.

08:17.640 --> 08:22.120
These vertical rides have lower capacity, which means slower loads and longer wait time for

08:22.120 --> 08:23.120
guests.

08:23.120 --> 08:27.040
Another alternative are indoor rides, like the Harry Potter or Transformers experiences

08:27.040 --> 08:32.040
at Universal, where robotic arms on a track rotate, tilt, and twist seats in movements

08:32.040 --> 08:36.800
that are synchronized with VFX that's projected on screen in front of riders.

08:36.800 --> 08:41.600
These rides are space efficient and even feature animatronics that blow water, heat, or air,

08:41.600 --> 08:47.000
but are also delicate and costly systems that require top end hardware, custom VFX, and

08:47.000 --> 08:49.020
years of intricate planning.

08:49.020 --> 08:52.480
With all roller coasters, there's a question of build versus buy.

08:52.480 --> 08:56.640
You can engineer your own from the ground up for maximum originality points, or you

08:56.640 --> 09:02.040
can settle for ready-made rides from manufacturers with preset specifications.

09:02.040 --> 09:05.720
If you want to make lots of money, you need as many rides and attractions as possible

09:05.720 --> 09:10.480
to maximize appeal and satisfaction, which requires both capital and land, with the latter

09:10.480 --> 09:12.520
being much harder to acquire.

09:12.520 --> 09:17.120
The average amusement park has a footprint between 100 to 500 acres.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.760
There is no hard rule in the industry that a successful amusement park must be over

09:20.760 --> 09:21.760
100 acres.

09:21.760 --> 09:26.240
There are plenty of small independent parks that are still live to this day on compact

09:26.240 --> 09:30.680
plots of land, like the two-acre Adventure City in Southern California.

09:30.680 --> 09:34.480
While these small parks adjust for their lesser offerings with cheaper tickets, they also

09:34.480 --> 09:39.240
rarely attract huge crowds or high spenders as consumers can experience everything they

09:39.240 --> 09:42.460
have to offer in half a day or less.

09:42.460 --> 09:46.760
The fundamental difference between grossing thousands and millions as an amusement park

09:46.760 --> 09:49.320
comes down to size and land.

09:49.320 --> 09:54.160
In this age where demand for housing is boiling over around the world, inventory of vacant

09:54.160 --> 09:58.960
commercial lots of 100 to 500 acres is largely non-existent.

09:58.960 --> 10:02.560
While there are always thousands of acres of undeveloped land that's for sale throughout

10:02.560 --> 10:07.720
the Midwest, the South, and other remote regions in the United States, these lots are generally

10:07.720 --> 10:13.480
not zoned for commercial recreation or they're simply too far from any major urban market.

10:13.480 --> 10:17.640
Any land in a metropolitan area these days that's still available, which could support

10:17.640 --> 10:22.720
an amusement park, is just too expensive or worth far more being developed for residential

10:22.720 --> 10:24.480
or commercial use.

10:24.480 --> 10:29.640
Municipalities can also be an obstacle as any high-profile, land-intensive, privatized

10:29.640 --> 10:34.680
recreational infrastructure like the taxpayer-funded sports stadiums of the past decade would be

10:34.680 --> 10:40.240
subject to intense public and political scrutiny.

10:40.240 --> 10:44.840
As an outdoors establishment, amusement parks are seasonal businesses where attendance,

10:44.840 --> 10:48.160
engagement, and earnings are dependent on the weather.

10:48.160 --> 10:52.320
Parks really only make money two quarters out of the year as a vast majority of business

10:52.320 --> 10:55.280
occurs between the months of May and September.

10:55.280 --> 10:59.720
What people often overlook is that the average amusement park is actually a regional business

10:59.720 --> 11:01.400
that serves locals.

11:01.400 --> 11:06.440
Disney and Universal are exceptions where their customer base are mostly international tourists

11:06.440 --> 11:09.720
and out-of-towners making pre-planned pilgrimages.

11:09.720 --> 11:14.280
As a result, location is even more important for conventional, non-IP-based amusement

11:14.280 --> 11:19.840
parks as they need to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of a major metropolitan area where

11:19.840 --> 11:24.840
locals can get into their cars, arrive before noon, and make it back home before midnight

11:24.840 --> 11:26.400
all in one day.

11:26.400 --> 11:30.680
Parks scale staffing by attendance and regularly bring on hundreds or thousands of minimum

11:30.680 --> 11:34.440
wage unskilled short-term workers to operate in the high season.

11:34.440 --> 11:38.560
In short, there needs to be a market with enough consumers and workers close by for

11:38.560 --> 11:40.960
an amusement park to be successful.

11:40.960 --> 11:45.920
Even if you get all the land, capital, planning, and rides in place, the only way to grow is

11:45.920 --> 11:47.280
to keep spending.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.920
Since the customer base is mostly going to be locals, they'll inevitably get bored

11:50.920 --> 11:52.680
after a few visits.

11:52.680 --> 11:57.760
On top of non-stop ride maintenance to ensure gas safety, renovation is essential to maintaining

11:57.760 --> 12:00.320
engagement and driving retention.

12:00.320 --> 12:04.240
If you have the land, you can always expand by adding more to the park, but more likely

12:04.240 --> 12:09.680
than not, your option is to remodel the existing rides into newer experiences.

12:09.680 --> 12:13.760
While renovations are never as expensive as the initial construction, remodeling is still

12:13.760 --> 12:18.240
significant capital expenditure that costs millions of dollars every year.

12:18.240 --> 12:22.200
To demonstrate just how real the barriers to entry are in this industry, in the past

12:22.200 --> 12:26.600
40 plus years, there's not been a single new regional amusement park in the United

12:26.600 --> 12:27.720
States.

12:27.720 --> 12:31.960
Every major market in the country is already served by an entrenched player, and burning

12:31.960 --> 12:36.880
over half a billion dollars to chase second place is a high-risk, low-reward strategy

12:36.880 --> 12:39.400
that very few investors are interested in.

12:39.400 --> 12:44.080
The last entrant was the Hard Rock Park in South Carolina that lasted just one year before

12:44.080 --> 12:46.320
going under in 2009.

12:46.320 --> 12:50.240
Hard Rock Park is just one of hundreds of other failed amusement parks in the world,

12:50.240 --> 12:55.320
and now nearly 15 years after its closure, only one company, FedEx, has been able to

12:55.320 --> 12:58.320
find some use from that abandoned land.

12:58.320 --> 13:02.000
Given how much it takes to make a single park successful, there's no established third

13:02.000 --> 13:06.520
party arrangement in the industry like franchising, where someone else will run the park for you

13:06.640 --> 13:10.880
and give you a royalty when they're already faced with so much overhead and day-to-day

13:10.880 --> 13:12.080
complexity.

13:12.080 --> 13:15.880
All these factors have made it so that legacy parks like Six Flags have been able to stay

13:15.880 --> 13:20.720
alive simply by virtue of having built their parks in the 70s or earlier.

13:20.720 --> 13:25.040
Six Flags portfolio consists of both amusement parks and water parks.

13:25.040 --> 13:29.880
While the number of parks under company ownership has gradually decreased over the past 20 years,

13:29.880 --> 13:36.280
Six Flags remains the largest regional amusement park operator in the world.

13:36.280 --> 13:41.120
On the West Coast, Six Flags Discovery Kingdom serves the San Francisco Bay Area and Northern

13:41.120 --> 13:45.960
California while Six Flags Magic Mountain caters to Los Angeles and the greater Southern

13:45.960 --> 13:47.040
California.

13:47.040 --> 13:52.080
On the East Coast, Six Flags New England serves Providence, Boston, and New Haven.

13:52.080 --> 13:56.680
Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey also caters to New York City and Philadelphia,

13:56.680 --> 13:59.840
and Six Flags in Maryland hits DC and Baltimore.

13:59.840 --> 14:04.720
In the Midwest, Six Flags Great America and Hurricane Harbor fill demand in from Chicago

14:04.720 --> 14:05.920
and Milwaukee.

14:05.920 --> 14:10.520
And in the South, Six Flags over Georgia is just a 20-minute drive from Atlanta, Six Flags

14:10.520 --> 14:16.120
over Texas, Targets Dallas, and Six Flags Fiesta Texas cover San Antonio, Houston,

14:16.120 --> 14:17.120
and Austin.

14:17.120 --> 14:21.120
The coverage and entrenchment of Six Flags in these leading consumer markets make the

14:21.120 --> 14:24.440
company an established, immovable legacy player.

14:24.440 --> 14:28.000
What's interesting is that Six Flags has only built three of these parks themselves

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
with the remainder being rebranded acquisitions.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.900
In this industry, first mover advantage is a true lasting moat, and the number and distribution

14:35.900 --> 14:40.980
of parks across the United States, Mexico, and Canada enable Six Flags not just to make

14:40.980 --> 14:44.820
more money, but also to safeguard against the weather and the economy.

14:44.820 --> 14:49.180
If there's a local downturn or severe rain in one region, the other unaffected parks

14:49.180 --> 14:51.100
can pick up the slack.

14:51.100 --> 14:56.600
Since the 70s, Six Flags has had one main strategy, to have the most legendary, spectacular,

14:56.600 --> 14:58.940
and thrilling roller coasters in the world.

14:58.940 --> 15:03.260
Since the company can't compete on intellectual property, the focus has been on maximizing

15:03.260 --> 15:04.620
spectacle.

15:04.620 --> 15:08.420
Real Capital is the official tagline given to every Six Flags park, and the company

15:08.420 --> 15:11.600
regularly pushes the boundaries of what's possible.

15:11.600 --> 15:16.060
Every year, Six Flags introduces groundbreaking rides, with endless examples through its history

15:16.060 --> 15:21.540
like New Revolution, which was the world's tallest roller coaster at opening in 1976,

15:21.540 --> 15:25.420
Superman, which was the world's tallest and first ever roller coaster to reach speeds

15:25.420 --> 15:30.860
of 100 miles per hour in 1997, X2 was the first ever fourth dimension roller coaster

15:30.860 --> 15:36.660
upon opening in 2002, King Dekas in 2005 remains the fastest ride in the continent and the

15:36.660 --> 15:41.460
tallest in the world, Zumanjara is the world's tallest drop tower, while the Goliath is the

15:41.460 --> 15:46.460
fastest wooden roller coaster, both of which opened to the public in 2014, and the Jersey

15:46.460 --> 15:52.300
Devil in 2020 broke records as the tallest and fastest single rail coaster in the world.

15:52.300 --> 15:56.120
Quote, we believe that you should have news in every park every year.

15:56.120 --> 15:59.620
This is different from what traditional theme parks do, where they'll put in a big coaster

15:59.620 --> 16:03.260
in a few of their parks, and then they'll go dark for a year or two while they put coasters

16:03.260 --> 16:05.080
in some of their other parks.

16:05.080 --> 16:09.320
We want to have a new ride or attraction in every park every year.

16:09.320 --> 16:13.320
Even though there are fewer Six Flags parks today than there were 20 years ago, this continuous

16:13.320 --> 16:18.460
differentiation on spectacle and the company's unmatched scale have kept Six Flags up as

16:18.460 --> 16:21.460
a cheaper alternative to Disney and Universal.

16:21.460 --> 16:25.100
Yet the construction and design costs of these rides are not trivial, and the payback

16:25.100 --> 16:31.180
periods are lengthy, as Six Flags invests over $100 million every year in capital expenditures.

16:31.180 --> 16:37.260
$100 million annually is roughly 9 to 10% of Six Flags gross revenue, but 30 to 50%

16:37.260 --> 16:41.480
of operating income, which is ultimately what matters since that's the cash you actually

16:41.480 --> 16:46.580
get after day to day expenses.

16:46.580 --> 16:51.340
Beyond having relatively more extreme thrill rides, Six Flags has tried to adapt to changing

16:51.340 --> 16:55.480
consumer tastes by bringing in intellectual property of its own.

16:55.480 --> 16:59.700
In an attempt to level the playing field with Disney and Universal, Six Flags has branded

16:59.700 --> 17:04.980
its rides and parks over the decades with iconic fictional characters like Bugs Bunny,

17:04.980 --> 17:11.300
Batman, Tweety Bird, Superman, and the Flintstones, a healthy mix of idolized superheroes and

17:11.300 --> 17:15.980
family-friendly animations for appeal to both teenagers and families.

17:15.980 --> 17:19.620
Like everything in the industry that we've seen so far, the cost for just renting these

17:19.620 --> 17:21.940
IPs come at a premium.

17:21.940 --> 17:27.260
Every year, Six Flags pays $3 to $8 million up front as a flat fee to Warner Bros, along

17:27.260 --> 17:33.380
with a 12 to 15% royalty on all branded merchandise in exchange for exclusive rides to license

17:33.380 --> 17:35.940
these characters at their amusement parks.

17:35.940 --> 17:39.820
But just like their box office performance, DC characters just don't have the same

17:39.820 --> 17:48.140
pull as Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, Nintendo, Harry Potter, Jurassic Park, or even One Piece.

17:48.140 --> 17:52.620
While Six Flags has not grown at the same rate as Disney or Universal, company revenue

17:52.620 --> 17:55.620
has been on a positive trajectory since 2002.

17:55.620 --> 18:00.180
For the past 20 years, admissions has represented the majority of Six Flags annual revenue,

18:00.180 --> 18:04.460
followed by food and merchandise sales inside the park, and then finally sponsorships and

18:04.460 --> 18:05.900
licensing.

18:05.900 --> 18:11.300
Revenue has been on a steady climb at 4% growth year over year for Six Flags, going from $880

18:11.300 --> 18:17.220
million in 2003 to $1.5 billion in 2019 before the pandemic.

18:17.220 --> 18:20.980
The numbers get interesting when we present them on a per-park basis.

18:20.980 --> 18:26.140
In the early 2000s, the average Six Flags grows between $20 to $30 million every year.

18:26.140 --> 18:31.700
In the 2010s before the pandemic, the average Six Flags park grows between $50 to $60 million

18:31.700 --> 18:33.020
every year.

18:33.020 --> 18:37.700
Roughly $30 million come from ticket admissions, while in-park food and merchandise sales make

18:37.700 --> 18:39.740
up the other $20 million.

18:39.740 --> 18:45.700
The average guest at Six Flags in the past decade spent roughly $40, with $25 going towards

18:45.700 --> 18:49.540
entry and $17 on in-park purchases.

18:49.540 --> 18:54.100
But before we go too far, it's important to contextualize the sleep in per-park earning

18:54.100 --> 18:55.340
productivity.

18:55.340 --> 18:59.900
While Six Flags has unmatched scale today, the company was operating at an even greater

18:59.900 --> 19:03.620
scale 20 years ago, albeit unsustainably.

19:03.620 --> 19:09.380
Starting in the 1990s, Six Flags took out over $2 billion of loans to chase first mover

19:09.380 --> 19:15.060
advantage in any market possible, borrowing money to buy parks across the United States,

19:15.180 --> 19:18.660
Germany, Holland, Belgium, and France.

19:18.660 --> 19:22.340
Most of these acquired parks were not performing, hence why they had been put up first sale

19:22.340 --> 19:23.820
in the first place.

19:23.820 --> 19:28.980
Despite selling at multi-million dollar premiums, each park required millions more in post-sales

19:28.980 --> 19:33.740
investment to reach their full potential, but Six Flags believed it uniquely possessed

19:33.740 --> 19:38.140
both the capital and the expertise to quickly turn these assets around.

19:38.140 --> 19:42.260
But many of these acquisitions were inherently constrained by being in markets that were either

19:42.260 --> 19:44.700
too soft or already contested.

19:44.700 --> 19:49.340
The contrast between Disneyland Paris and Disneyland Orlando to this day is a clear

19:49.340 --> 19:53.980
reminder to the industry that there are insurmountable cultural differences.

19:53.980 --> 19:59.460
The lifestyle-oriented and economical European just doesn't have the same appetite, demand,

19:59.460 --> 20:04.420
and standard for amusement parks that overworked capitalist Americans do.

20:06.940 --> 20:11.620
As Six Flags borrowed more money, bought more parks, took on more overhead, and invested

20:11.620 --> 20:16.260
more every year to make each asset successful, the company was in reality digging itself

20:16.260 --> 20:18.140
into a deep hole.

20:18.140 --> 20:23.740
Debt skyrocketed to $2.3 billion and remained there for years, which was two to three times

20:23.740 --> 20:27.900
the total revenue that Six Flags was bringing in every year.

20:27.900 --> 20:32.060
Through the 2000s, Six Flags posted loss after loss and there were little signs that their

20:32.060 --> 20:33.940
strategy was working.

20:33.940 --> 20:38.500
While overall revenue increased with the addition of each additional park, costs also increased

20:38.500 --> 20:41.420
in line at a near one-to-one ratio.

20:41.420 --> 20:45.740
Six Flags did not generate enough cash from operating at times to even cover the annual

20:45.740 --> 20:48.620
interest that was due on its massive debts.

20:48.620 --> 20:52.420
Even in the years where Six Flags didn't buy parks, the company was still not grossing

20:52.420 --> 20:58.060
enough to afford all the renovation and improvements that were occurring in its existing assets.

20:58.060 --> 21:02.540
In a classic story of robbing Peter to pay Paul, Six Flags borrowed money from one place

21:02.540 --> 21:07.460
to pay off debts from another, issuing millions of preferred stock to raise funds, selling

21:07.460 --> 21:12.380
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bonds, refinancing existing credit lines and

21:12.380 --> 21:16.580
using all these proceeds to repay debt and to maintain liquidity.

21:16.580 --> 21:21.060
The company even went so far as to use some of the debt to pay out dividends to investors

21:21.060 --> 21:22.700
despite being in the red.

21:22.700 --> 21:27.260
And when Six Flags could no longer continue this financial equivalent of Russian roulette,

21:27.260 --> 21:32.340
the company begrudgingly sold off its European division and abandoned underperforming locations,

21:32.340 --> 21:37.620
going from nearly 40 parks in 2003 to just 20 parks by 2007.

21:37.620 --> 21:42.180
Overall revenue improved with the streamlining as did earnings productivity as only the best

21:42.180 --> 21:43.540
parks remained.

21:43.540 --> 21:49.100
The average Six Flags park grossed around $40-50 million in the mid-2000s, nearly double

21:49.100 --> 21:51.740
compared to that of the early 2000s.

21:51.740 --> 21:55.820
But the company continued to kick debt down the road, the losses continued, and when the

21:55.820 --> 22:01.300
Great Recession hit in 2008, it was the straw that finally broke the camel's back.

22:01.300 --> 22:05.500
Recession parks have long sold themselves as recession-proof defensive businesses.

22:05.500 --> 22:10.820
While airlines, cruises, hotels, resorts, and other traditional travel businesses will

22:10.820 --> 22:15.400
lose customers in recession, the parks industry has pushed the argument that people still

22:15.400 --> 22:20.020
need somewhere to escape to despite cutting back on vacations, and amusement parks are

22:20.020 --> 22:23.900
unmatched in the value and the entertainment that they provide.

22:23.900 --> 22:28.420
Despite the industry's positioning, fewer guests came to the park during the Great Recession,

22:28.420 --> 22:31.440
and the ones that did show up spent less than before.

22:31.440 --> 22:36.000
This drop in attendance and by extension revenue brought Six Flags to the point of bankruptcy

22:36.000 --> 22:39.340
in 2009, but its parks remained open.

22:39.340 --> 22:44.460
After a high-profile restructuring, Six Flags emerged from bankruptcy in 2010 as lenders

22:44.460 --> 22:48.500
forgave over a billion dollars of debt in exchange for full ownership.

22:48.500 --> 22:52.860
The new owners who were traumatized from this near-death experience aggressively overhauled

22:52.860 --> 22:57.400
Six Flags' business model and pricing strategy into what it believed would be a safer and

22:57.400 --> 22:59.200
more reliable variant.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.960
This decision would bring success, but it would also dig the company into a different

23:02.960 --> 23:10.920
hole over the next decade, and one that Six Flags is still trying to crawl out of today.

23:10.920 --> 23:15.800
Six Flags went into the 2010s with the laser focus on selling memberships and season passes

23:15.800 --> 23:19.040
over traditional full-priced gate tickets.

23:19.040 --> 23:23.120
Memberships on paper were sticky, recurring revenue in which customers would pay an annual

23:23.120 --> 23:27.040
fee to get unlimited entry and perks every year.

23:27.040 --> 23:31.560
This annual fee was typically spread out into a flexible payment plan, so customers only

23:31.560 --> 23:36.000
needed to pay out a few dollars every month to maintain their membership.

23:36.000 --> 23:40.840
Season passes on the other hand also offered unlimited entry and a few perks, but expired

23:40.840 --> 23:44.600
at the end of every season for a cheaper one-time fee.

23:44.600 --> 23:49.000
These products were advantageous for the company in that Six Flags got to collect payment upfront

23:49.000 --> 23:52.360
at the time of purchase rather than at the time of visit.

23:52.360 --> 23:56.120
Even if customers didn't go to the park, Six Flags would have still made money.

23:56.120 --> 24:00.600
From a psychology standpoint, it also reversed roles in that Six Flags no longer had to convince

24:00.600 --> 24:05.960
customers to come as pass holders and members would naturally feel compelled to visit regularly

24:05.960 --> 24:08.160
to get the most out of their purchase.

24:08.160 --> 24:13.880
In 2010, a one-day entry ticket to Six Flags at the gate cost $30 to $40 and parking would

24:13.880 --> 24:15.840
set you back another $10 to $20.

24:15.840 --> 24:19.240
A season pass that year was priced at just $70.

24:19.240 --> 24:24.400
In 2014, a one-day ticket cost $65, but it was a much better deal to buy the season pass

24:24.480 --> 24:30.400
for $80 or to subscribe to a membership for $100 as those products included free parking.

24:30.400 --> 24:34.240
As long as a season pass holder visited the park at least twice a year, they were saving

24:34.240 --> 24:36.240
$50 per person.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.440
In theory, everyone was a winner.

24:38.440 --> 24:42.720
The value-oriented consumer felt like they got the best deal, fans felt like they were

24:42.720 --> 24:48.440
being rewarded for their loyalty, and Six Flags got to collect and recognize revenue upfront

24:48.440 --> 24:51.880
in a steady, reoccurring, predictable manner.

24:51.880 --> 24:56.760
While Six Flags product strategy was to build as many groundbreaking thrill rides as possible,

24:56.760 --> 24:59.400
their pricing strategy was all about value.

24:59.400 --> 25:03.800
The assumption behind the season passes and memberships is that the lost revenue from discounted

25:03.800 --> 25:08.160
admissions would be easily made up through in-park food and merchandise sales.

25:08.160 --> 25:12.280
In the mind of Six Flags executives, the most important thing was volume.

25:12.280 --> 25:16.640
With such high overhead and fixed costs, they believed it was better to fill each park with

25:16.640 --> 25:21.840
as many bodies as possible versus gatekeeping over a few bucks in admissions.

25:21.840 --> 25:25.640
As long as people were buying something in the park when they visited, those high-margin

25:25.640 --> 25:29.280
sales would be enough to offset the ticket subsidies.

25:29.280 --> 25:33.760
The problem is that Six Flags went overboard, aggressively discounting season passes and

25:33.760 --> 25:38.040
memberships to substantially cheaper price points than one-day tickets while giving away

25:38.040 --> 25:44.200
too much for free with free parking, skip-the-line privileges, and complimentary dining.

25:44.200 --> 25:48.320
With this new focus on value, annual guest attendance for Six Flags grew at a steady

25:48.320 --> 25:54.320
pace from 24 million visitors in 2011 to 30 million by 2016.

25:54.320 --> 25:58.920
If we break out Six Flags revenue into its two main income streams, revenue from park

25:58.920 --> 26:05.800
admissions grew the most at 45% in a nine-year period, going from $452 million in 2010 to

26:05.800 --> 26:09.160
$815 million in 2019.

26:09.160 --> 26:15.200
Food and merchandise sales grew slower at 40% in the same time frame from $348 million

26:15.280 --> 26:21.120
to $574 million, which was solid, but not what Six Flags had been hoping for.

26:21.120 --> 26:25.260
The company had been making every effort to keep ticket prices as flat as possible since

26:25.260 --> 26:26.760
the Great Recession.

26:26.760 --> 26:31.440
In nine years, the average price of a Six Flags ticket increased in line with inflation

26:31.440 --> 26:32.440
at 17%.

26:32.440 --> 26:37.960
In 2010, the average ticket to Six Flags cost $21.26.

26:37.960 --> 26:44.960
In 2019, the average ticket to Six Flags cost just $24.86, which was just $3.60 million

26:45.200 --> 26:47.880
more than what it cost nine years ago.

26:47.880 --> 26:52.520
On an annual basis, we can see how sensitive the company was towards raising ticket prices

26:52.520 --> 26:55.440
and how attached they were to discounting admissions.

26:55.440 --> 27:00.080
In any year where the average ticket price increased, like in 2014, the company would

27:00.080 --> 27:06.040
immediately push the cost back down in the following years.

27:06.040 --> 27:09.880
Subsidizing tickets would not be a big deal if that spend was being recaptured in the

27:09.880 --> 27:15.160
park, but the average spend on food and merchandise per guest had gone up just $1.00 and $12.00

27:15.160 --> 27:17.280
cents in nine years.

27:17.280 --> 27:22.760
Guests on average were spending just $17 to $18 per visit, and it was no secret why.

27:22.760 --> 27:27.240
People were leaving Six Flags, going to their cars, driving to the closest fast food chain

27:27.240 --> 27:32.000
to eat, and then returning to the park, or they were already coming to the park full.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.800
Few people wanted to get ripped off with 10 to $15 plates of frozen chicken strips, fries

27:36.800 --> 27:37.800
and pizza.

27:37.800 --> 27:42.560
The budget-conscious value-oriented consumers that Six Flags targeted were especially conscious

27:42.560 --> 27:44.720
not to fall into such traps.

27:44.720 --> 27:49.320
While Six Flags showered its pass holders and members with massive discounts and perks,

27:49.320 --> 27:53.600
in reality the company was never going to change the nature of bargain hunters.

27:53.600 --> 27:58.280
Rather than improving the in-park concessions, Six Flags opted to simply slap dining onto

27:58.280 --> 28:03.200
the season pass and memberships as a way to upsell and to collect more revenue up front.

28:03.200 --> 28:08.200
For a higher fee, season pass holders could get two free meals, snacks, and drinks every

28:08.200 --> 28:09.680
time they visited.

28:09.680 --> 28:13.480
Headlines were made when a California man revealed that he ate lunch and dinner at his

28:13.480 --> 28:19.680
local Six Flags every day for seven years using just his annual $150 season pass.

28:19.680 --> 28:24.320
This man would drive to Six Flags, drop in for lunch, while this story and individual

28:24.320 --> 28:29.020
is clearly an extreme, it's still an entertaining representation of the excessive discounting

28:29.020 --> 28:34.640
and generosity that Six Flags engaged in during the 2010s just to fill the parks.

28:34.640 --> 28:38.920
There was still enough up front and recurring revenue flowing in from memberships and passes

28:38.920 --> 28:41.760
to keep the company on its positive trajectory.

28:41.760 --> 28:46.400
Through the 2010s, Six Flags revenue grew at a positive pace while the bottom line returned

28:46.400 --> 28:49.680
in the black compared to the red of the prior decade.

28:49.680 --> 28:55.240
Roughly 1.5 million people visited Six Flags every year in the 2010s compared to the sub-million

28:55.240 --> 28:56.960
of the 2000s.

28:56.960 --> 29:02.000
Earning productivity peaked in 2016 as the average Six Flags park grossed over $70 million

29:02.000 --> 29:08.640
a year with roughly $37 million attributed to admissions and the remainder to concessions.

29:08.640 --> 29:12.560
During margin returned to positive digits, which was another welcome improvement compared

29:12.560 --> 29:15.440
to the negative streak of the prior decade.

29:15.440 --> 29:20.720
At this point, season pass and membership holders accounted for 50 to 60% of Six Flags

29:20.720 --> 29:23.200
annual attendance every year.

29:23.200 --> 29:27.480
The pass model was working as desired and the only thing left to do was to slam on the

29:27.480 --> 29:29.280
gas pedal even harder.

29:29.280 --> 29:35.440
In 2016, Six Flags began buying up water parks within a 150 mile radius to their existing

29:35.440 --> 29:39.840
amusement parks with the only goal of selling higher priced combo passes.

29:39.840 --> 29:43.560
The company envisioned that existing season pass holders who were in search of getting

29:43.560 --> 29:49.280
the best deal possible would happily pay an extra $20-40 up front to get unlimited access

29:49.280 --> 29:52.960
to a nearby water park even if they were unlikely to visit it.

29:52.960 --> 29:57.520
In an all too familiar pattern, Six Flags once again began borrowing large sums of money

29:57.520 --> 30:03.120
to finance these acquisitions and long term debt crossed the $2 billion mark once more.

30:03.120 --> 30:07.880
While the water park roll-up strategy helped ensure top line growth, company profits largely

30:07.880 --> 30:15.200
stagnated under this two park strategy as in-park spend remained flat.

30:15.200 --> 30:20.200
To alleviate investor concerns, Six Flags leadership spun a growth story to Wall Street

30:20.200 --> 30:25.600
that international licensing was this fast emerging, high margin, service based, asset

30:25.600 --> 30:29.360
light revenue stream that could quickly help pay down this growing debt.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.760
We did a study a couple years ago that looked at our brand awareness outside the United

30:33.760 --> 30:34.760
States.

30:34.760 --> 30:40.680
Six Flags brand recognition was very, very high, even higher than Universal and Disneyland.

30:40.680 --> 30:45.000
People look at us and say that we at Six Flags have the success and expertise to open up

30:45.000 --> 30:46.560
amusement parks.

30:46.560 --> 30:50.120
We don't invest any of our own money into these deals, we're basically working with

30:50.120 --> 30:54.280
partners who have access to land and funds to build parks.

30:54.280 --> 30:58.520
We're paid for design and development, we get a set fee and once the park is opened

30:58.520 --> 31:03.440
up, we get an ongoing revenue stream and management services and royalties generated

31:03.440 --> 31:04.440
from the park.

31:04.440 --> 31:07.000
There's no capital investment for us.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.400
We start making money on day one.

31:09.400 --> 31:14.680
The company proudly announced it had secured deals with partners in Dubai, Vietnam, Saudi

31:14.680 --> 31:19.600
Arabia and China who had deep pockets and ambitions of their own to build tons of Six

31:19.600 --> 31:21.640
Flags parks in their countries.

31:21.640 --> 31:25.400
When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.

31:25.400 --> 31:29.440
Like most private cross-border ventures, every single one of these partners turned out to

31:29.440 --> 31:33.400
be either extremely naive or pure snake oil salesman.

31:33.400 --> 31:38.640
The Vietnamese partner Navi Entertainment, an offshoot of a supposed plastic glove factory

31:38.640 --> 31:41.680
vanished overnight just months after the announcement.

31:41.680 --> 31:45.200
The Dubai partner pulled the plug on the Six Flags deal as they found out that they were

31:45.200 --> 31:49.800
already losing too much money on their existing resorts and the Chinese partner defaulted as

31:49.800 --> 31:51.480
soon as payments were due.

31:51.480 --> 31:56.440
And while every other amusement park operator like Cedar Park, Disney and Universal have

31:56.440 --> 32:01.920
all rebounded from COVID, Six Flags remains laggard as attendance and revenue have remained

32:01.920 --> 32:04.200
below pre-pandemic levels.

32:04.200 --> 32:09.040
The pandemic, for better or worse, accelerated the once reliable, value-oriented season

32:09.040 --> 32:13.240
pass holders to critically rethink their spend with Six Flags.

32:13.240 --> 32:18.160
Under the pressures of declining attendance, $2 billion in debt and a non-existent growth

32:18.680 --> 32:22.320
Six Flags candid's longtime CEO in 2022.

32:22.320 --> 32:26.360
His successor didn't mince any words, pointing the finger at the company's long-time discount

32:26.360 --> 32:30.360
strategy as the primary culprit for Six Flags' present-day struggles.

32:30.360 --> 32:34.880
Quote, literally, we have discounted too much, and the philosophy of filling parks was not

32:34.880 --> 32:36.280
the right strategy.

32:36.280 --> 32:40.120
At the end of it all, people did not have a good experience, it was not an experience

32:40.120 --> 32:41.960
that people were willing to pay for.

32:41.960 --> 32:46.200
We only got the discounter, and Six Flags became a cheap daycare center for teenagers

32:46.280 --> 32:48.120
during breaks and summers.

32:48.120 --> 32:52.360
We've eliminated many of our historical discounts, including free or ultra-low price

32:52.360 --> 32:56.640
tickets, and are settling on an approach that balances attendance and revenue.

32:56.640 --> 33:00.960
We have reset our strategy and operational priorities, and at a high level, we're focused

33:00.960 --> 33:05.400
on providing a premium guest experience and will charge prices that are in line with the

33:05.400 --> 33:07.560
value we deliver to our guests.

33:07.560 --> 33:12.560
We believe we have pricing power, but only if we deliver an exceptional guest experience.

33:12.560 --> 33:18.200
The average revenue per guest, both in in-park spend and admissions, skyrocketed in 2023

33:18.200 --> 33:22.320
as going to Six Flags became a lot more expensive under the new CEO.

33:22.320 --> 33:26.920
The reality was that while Six Flags focused on spectacle to win headlines and grab attention

33:26.920 --> 33:31.040
and season past sales to keep the numbers up, the company completely neglected the core

33:31.040 --> 33:32.840
guest experience.

33:32.840 --> 33:37.440
Parks had become overcrowded with too many value-oriented pass holders who weren't spending, parking

33:37.440 --> 33:41.800
lots were congested as too many people had free parking, restaurants inside the park were

33:41.800 --> 33:46.200
taking up to an hour to serve their orders, concession quality had plummeted since food

33:46.200 --> 33:51.080
had mostly been given away for free to drive season past sales, and restrooms were always

33:51.080 --> 33:54.480
dirty since the park was always at maximum capacity.

33:54.480 --> 33:57.920
Everything that wasn't a shiny new roller coaster was just old.

33:57.920 --> 34:02.640
For instance, Six Flags is just now putting in digital screens that will display the real-time

34:02.640 --> 34:07.520
waits for rides and restaurants, which is technology that Universal and Disneyland have

34:07.520 --> 34:11.560
had for years.

34:11.560 --> 34:14.880
There are several lessons from Six Flags worth reinforcing.

34:14.880 --> 34:19.280
One is that it's a mistake to interpret every dollar and every customer as a win without

34:19.280 --> 34:22.880
considering the quality of the dollar and the quality of the customer.

34:22.880 --> 34:27.800
The former CEO ignored years of internal data that showed that guests who came in on discounted

34:27.800 --> 34:32.640
tickets simply did not spend as much time and money as those that paid full price yet

34:32.640 --> 34:35.000
took up the same park capacity.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.880
This learning is applicable even in the world of media, where outsiders and brands tend

34:38.880 --> 34:41.360
to equate every view as the same.

34:41.360 --> 34:46.320
When the lens of either a creator or an advertiser is getting millions of views really a win

34:46.320 --> 34:51.160
if most of those views are actually from teenagers who treat the content as a commodity for them

34:51.160 --> 34:52.360
to kill time with.

34:52.360 --> 34:56.000
In the case of content, the quality of the viewer should matter more than the overall

34:56.000 --> 34:57.840
view count.

34:57.840 --> 35:01.280
Traditional business thinking teaches that losing a customer is a huge negative that

35:01.280 --> 35:03.400
should be avoided at all costs.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.880
But in practice, churn in itself can be healthy.

35:06.880 --> 35:10.920
Businesses will get better by accepting customer attrition rather than bending over backwards

35:10.960 --> 35:13.560
to get customers to stay.

35:13.560 --> 35:17.840
Discounting to keep customers paying or to get first timers in the door is an easy way

35:17.840 --> 35:23.000
out that brings in short term success at the expense of long term sustainability.

35:23.000 --> 35:28.040
With discounting, brands get diluted, the core high value users get neglected and all

35:28.040 --> 35:32.240
the attention goes towards appeasing fickle, low value customers.

35:32.240 --> 35:37.320
Yet discounting remains today a rampant practice across consumer and enterprise sectors as

35:37.320 --> 35:42.320
companies continue to throw everything these days, bundles, perks and discounts just to

35:42.320 --> 35:46.520
unlock the next subscriber or to secure that upcoming renewal.

35:46.520 --> 35:49.960
In the case of Six Flags, the quality of the customer should have mattered more than the

35:49.960 --> 35:52.280
number of customers at the park.

35:52.280 --> 35:57.640
And despite 60 years of operating history, Six Flags is just now trying to quantify for

35:57.640 --> 36:02.160
the first time what the real value of its parks are to the modern consumer, all while

36:02.160 --> 36:06.880
Disney and Universal continue to raise the bar higher and higher every year.

36:06.880 --> 36:11.840
The second lesson here is that the cost to generate any $1 of revenue is just as critical

36:11.840 --> 36:15.200
as the conventional measures of margins and profits.

36:15.200 --> 36:19.360
When we look at Six Flags' top line and bottom line, it looks respectable with healthy double

36:19.360 --> 36:22.560
digit margins and billion dollar revenue.

36:22.560 --> 36:27.160
Given the wary reception by the public markets, Six Flags has no choice but to lean on debt

36:27.160 --> 36:29.560
over equity to maintain liquidity.

36:29.560 --> 36:34.000
And the worst part is that every capital improvement in the amusement park industry, whether in

36:34.000 --> 36:39.240
the form of ride renovations or food overhaul, will naturally be an expensive endeavor.

36:39.240 --> 36:44.520
In the case of Six Flags, debt is not a lifeline or contingency or growth accelerant like it

36:44.520 --> 36:46.400
is for traditional businesses.

36:46.400 --> 36:51.560
Instead, debt is like an IV bag where the steady drip of funds keeps the company alive

36:51.560 --> 36:54.800
even in non-recession, fair weather climates.

36:54.800 --> 36:59.280
There is no lean methodology that can be applied to this naturally bloated and capital intensive

36:59.400 --> 37:00.400
business.

37:00.400 --> 37:04.640
And lenders will continue to let Six Flags borrow as the company's assets, notably

37:04.640 --> 37:07.640
its land, still carry high book value.

37:07.640 --> 37:10.960
From the outside, Six Flags has a seemingly powerful moat.

37:10.960 --> 37:14.640
As no one can get into this industry, and if they do, they'll never be able to reach

37:14.640 --> 37:16.800
their scale in 100 years.

37:16.800 --> 37:20.800
But at the same time, the reality might also be that no one wants to.

37:20.800 --> 37:24.720
These days, a startup will happily boast that they've reached $5 million or $10 million

37:25.120 --> 37:30.200
in ARR, but if they also need to spend two to five times that amount to reach that milestone,

37:30.200 --> 37:34.080
their business is likely not as robust or as momentous as they're making it out to

37:34.080 --> 37:35.080
be.

37:35.080 --> 37:39.400
And the only difference here is that the startup uses equity as their runway and has no collateral

37:39.400 --> 37:41.040
to use debt.

37:41.040 --> 37:45.240
The third lesson is that despite what Wall Street says, reoccurring revenue does not

37:45.240 --> 37:49.080
inherently make for a better or stronger business.

37:49.080 --> 37:53.440
Subscription revenue makes a financially safer business as churn is more gradual, revenue

37:53.520 --> 37:57.720
is more predictable, and forecasts can be more sound, which are all things that only

37:57.720 --> 37:59.640
investors care about.

37:59.640 --> 38:03.760
If your product or service isn't good enough, people will still churn regardless of whether

38:03.760 --> 38:08.640
or not they're paying $10 a month or $100 upfront every year.

38:08.640 --> 38:11.640
The final lesson is that headlines never last.

38:11.640 --> 38:16.400
Six Flags put millions of dollars every year towards building the fastest, tallest, scariest

38:16.400 --> 38:21.080
rides for decades and spent millions more on making sure everyone knew about it.

38:21.080 --> 38:25.760
The reality is that like all splashy marketing announcements, these record-breaking rides

38:25.760 --> 38:31.520
all had relatively short-lived impact and were regarded by the public as one-time novelties.

38:31.520 --> 38:35.800
Yet the mainstream spotlight and the continuous headlines over the decades gave Six Flags

38:35.800 --> 38:40.160
leadership the false confidence that the company branding was so strong they could get away

38:40.160 --> 38:44.160
turning a blind eye towards the core guest experience.

38:44.160 --> 38:48.760
Attention is overrated, fame is fleeting, and the real value in business and in life

38:48.760 --> 38:53.480
is always from the mundane, unglamorous, quiet work behind the scenes that you never see

38:53.480 --> 38:54.920
on camera.

38:54.920 --> 38:58.880
When you're not the mouse or the wizard, you usually don't get a fairytale ending.

38:58.880 --> 39:02.920
But for Six Flags, they'll keep getting chances to write their own as no one else will be

39:02.920 --> 39:05.560
entering into this industry anytime soon.
