1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,480
Screaming on roller coasters, getting splashed on log rides, ramming friends in bumper cars,

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,200
and riding on carousels with family are treasured memories for those who grew up in the 2000s

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,200
and earlier.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,760
The amusement park just like the shopping mall and movie theater was once a seemingly

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,680
indispensable establishment for every major metropolitan.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,600
In the eras before the internet and where availability mattered above all else, the

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,440
amusement park thrived as a provider of affordable recreation.

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,200
People of all ages could have fun at the park for an entire day which is $20-$30 and within

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,960
a 1-2 hour drive from their homes.

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,080
Yet fast forward to the present and amusement parks are a dying breed in the modern age.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,960
In the past amusement parks were defined by their rides like how fast a certain roller

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,200
coaster traveled or how steep a drop tower was.

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,380
Nowadays what matters most for an amusement park is intellectual property.

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,060
With the emergence of the Disney adult, consumers around the world have shown a preference

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:04,540
for IP based theme parks like Universal Studios and Disneyland where the branded attractions,

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,660
concessions, and merchandise have fueled above average spending and immense popularity.

17
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,500
Consumers have shown an insatiable appetite to immerse themselves in their favorite media

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,780
franchises, paying without hesitation for $9 butter beer from Harry Potter, $10 pink

19
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,860
sprinkle donuts from The Simpsons, $12 Mario Strawberry Soda from Nintendo, $15 meat on

20
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:30,660
the bone from One Piece, $8 Blue Milk from Star Wars, and $7 Cheesecake Orbs from the

21
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,780
Marvel Cinematic Universe.

22
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,040
Beyond rides and concessions, the IPs come to life at these parks where visitors get to

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,660
mingle shoulder to shoulder with bubbly costume performers who behave just like their big

24
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,980
screen blockbuster equivalents.

25
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,540
While park goers soak up this magical atmosphere, underneath every costume is a blue collar

26
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,300
worker who's sweating buckets and being paid minimum wage to entertain thousands of strangers

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,540
every day.

28
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,300
The themed foods, branded attractions, exclusive merchandise, and trademark characters have

29
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,180
elevated experiences and expectations to the point where conventional amusement parks can

30
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:08,660
no longer compete with their generic foods, mascots, and rides.

31
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:14,460
When customers want Space Mountain, The Avengers Campus, The Millennium Falcon, Diagon Alley,

32
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:20,020
Minions, and Elsa, having the fastest roller coaster is suddenly a lot less relevant.

33
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,520
While the local park will always be more convenient and affordable with admissions and run-of-the-mill

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,480
concessions, compared to Disney and Universal, who charge two to five times more for entry

35
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,660
alone, customers ultimately vote with their wallet.

36
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,360
In this day and age, customers have demonstrated through their spend, attendance, and virality

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,480
that they'd rather make a special trip to Disney and Universal than go to the basic

38
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,320
regional amusement park.

39
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,720
In this episode, we'll cover the business of roller coasters through the lens of Six

40
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,120
Flags, the largest operator of amusement parks in the world, and the many strategies

41
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,720
that the company has employed to survive, differentiate itself, and to capture whatever

42
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,840
share that remains in this ultra-competitive market.

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,640
For older generations, the amusement park was a unique place of happiness and entertainment

44
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,840
in a time where mental health was taboo.

45
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,520
And this episode is sponsored by BetterHelp, the leader in affordable, accessible online

46
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,520
therapy.

47
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,600
In my early 20s, I grinded after graduation, like many of my peers, working long hours,

48
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,000
appeasing my bosses, coming in on weekends, and ignoring personal obligations just so

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,040
I could be the highest performer in corporate America.

50
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,000
I worked like this for years, always stressed, irritable, impatient, and cranky, but when

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,040
my products were randomly killed off and my engineering teams were fired, did I realize

52
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,040
I needed help?

53
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,400
I wanted to become a better person and to still work hard, but no longer at the expense

54
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,280
of family, friends, and my own mental health.

55
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,840
I went to therapy.

56
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,720
Being a non-judgmental professional and a safe environment was cathartic and healing

57
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
for me.

58
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,960
Just talking about my problems and recognizing them out loud was profound.

59
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,920
Therapy is beneficial for everyone, even 20-year-old dudes like me, and BetterHelp's

60
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,240
mission is to make therapy more affordable and accessible.

61
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,480
BetterHelp is a platform that makes finding a therapist easier as it's fully online

62
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,720
and remote.

63
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,920
By just filling out a few questions, BetterHelp can match you to a professional therapist

64
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,760
in as little as a few days, and if you don't click with your matched therapist, you can

65
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,320
easily switch to a new one at no additional cost without stressing about insurance and

66
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,480
networks.

67
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,680
If you're stressed or struggling, consider BetterHelp.

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,680
Therapy was invaluable for me and my times of need, and when you visit betterhelp.com

slash MBA, you can get 10% off your first month of therapy.

70
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,800
Mental health is just as important as physical health, and online therapy is one of the cheapest,

71
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,920
easiest, and most effective ways to take care of yourself.

72
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,120
Like going to the gym or having a good diet, it doesn't hurt to try therapy.

73
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,960
Thank you to BetterHelp for supporting Modern MBA and making this episode possible.

74
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,520
To understand the business of amusement parks, we can draw from Roller Coaster Tycoon.

75
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,480
For people who aren't familiar, Roller Coaster Tycoon is a popular simulation game where

76
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,120
you can build and manage your own amusement park.

77
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,960
You choose which rides go where, what types of rides to offer, where to place footpaths

78
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,760
to direct visitors from one attraction to the next, where to place the bathrooms, where

79
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,960
to put concession stands to optimize food and drink sales, and how much staff to hire

80
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,080
to keep the park running smoothly.

81
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,080
All while maximizing profits, guest satisfaction, park appeal, property value, and ROI from

82
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
the limited budget available.

83
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,360
Just like in real life, there are consequences to poor planning and bad investments.

84
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,040
If there aren't enough security guards, the park will become chaotic and suffer vandalism.

85
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,360
Guests will complain about hygiene if there aren't enough bathrooms or janitors.

86
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,040
If there are too many visitors, then guest happiness will decrease with the overcrowding.

87
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,940
If a ride is too intense, then guests will get sick.

88
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,880
If a ride is too fast, the chance of accidents increase.

89
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,280
If there aren't enough handymen to perform maintenance, then the roller coasters will

90
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
break down.

91
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,480
If the prices are too high, then customers won't spend.

92
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,680
And if the rides aren't regularly renovated, then visitors will get bored and park appeal

93
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,400
will decrease.

94
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,320
While Roller Coaster Tycoon nails that planning and maintenance are integral to the success

95
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,600
of any amusement park, there are a variety of other factors outside of this video game

96
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,960
depiction that make the overall business so uniquely difficult.

97
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,480
The core business model of the amusement park is fairly straightforward.

98
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,200
You pull in as many customers as you can, and you entertain them so they stay as long

99
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,160
as possible and spend as much as possible.

100
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,280
Once customers are inside the park, you can monetize them aggressively with high markups

101
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,680
on food and merchandise to squeeze more dollars from entry tickets.

102
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,800
At cruise ships, amusement parks are capital intensive businesses where continuous monetization

103
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,160
by volume and margin are necessary to offset the huge operating costs and massive overhead.

104
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,400
As we covered in the episode on cruises, a single cruise ship costs over half a billion

105
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,480
dollars.

106
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,360
And amusement parks are no different in that the construction of a single park falls in

107
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,360
the same ballpark with costs of 400 to 800 million dollars, whereas the top of the line

108
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,560
Disney or Universal theme park ranges in the billions.

109
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,720
Despite comparable capital requirements to cruises, the barriers to entry are actually

110
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,940
much higher for amusement parks.

111
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,560
The bottleneck for amusement parks is not really just the labor, engineering or material,

112
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,440
but rather in the land.

113
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,240
Parks conventionally build appeal by having one or two centerpiece roller coasters that

114
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,880
goes super fast, super high, and have maximum airtime.

115
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,160
Even if the average visitor is too scared to ride them, these thrill rides are by design

116
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,040
defining attractions that are super tall, super long, and super wide, so parks generally

117
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,480
build other attractions around them to generate atmosphere, attention, and curb appeal.

118
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,600
But to go fast and high, these roller coasters need lots of space, mile long tracks, and

119
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,560
can eat up 5 to 10 acres by themselves.

120
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,080
On the flip side, smaller rides like kiddie coasters are significantly more space efficient

121
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,120
with footprints of half an acre or less, but they're also a lot less memorable to visitors.

122
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,800
If a park has too many thrill rides, then the family business will be hard to attract

123
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,200
and capture, whereas a park with too many kiddie coasters and not enough thrill rides

124
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,880
will lose the teenager and adult market.

125
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,960
While there have been innovations in recent years with space efficient vertical oriented

126
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,640
roller coasters that don't require lift hills, trade-offs still remain.

127
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,120
These vertical rides have lower capacity, which means slower loads and longer wait time for

128
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
guests.

129
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,040
Another alternative are indoor rides, like the Harry Potter or Transformers experiences

130
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,040
at Universal, where robotic arms on a track rotate, tilt, and twist seats in movements

131
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,800
that are synchronized with VFX that's projected on screen in front of riders.

132
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,600
These rides are space efficient and even feature animatronics that blow water, heat, or air,

133
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,000
but are also delicate and costly systems that require top end hardware, custom VFX, and

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,020
years of intricate planning.

135
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,480
With all roller coasters, there's a question of build versus buy.

136
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,640
You can engineer your own from the ground up for maximum originality points, or you

137
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,040
can settle for ready-made rides from manufacturers with preset specifications.

138
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,720
If you want to make lots of money, you need as many rides and attractions as possible

139
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:10,480
to maximize appeal and satisfaction, which requires both capital and land, with the latter

140
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,520
being much harder to acquire.

141
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,120
The average amusement park has a footprint between 100 to 500 acres.

142
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,760
There is no hard rule in the industry that a successful amusement park must be over

143
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
100 acres.

144
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,240
There are plenty of small independent parks that are still live to this day on compact

145
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,680
plots of land, like the two-acre Adventure City in Southern California.

146
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,480
While these small parks adjust for their lesser offerings with cheaper tickets, they also

147
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,240
rarely attract huge crowds or high spenders as consumers can experience everything they

148
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,460
have to offer in half a day or less.

149
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,760
The fundamental difference between grossing thousands and millions as an amusement park

150
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,320
comes down to size and land.

151
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,160
In this age where demand for housing is boiling over around the world, inventory of vacant

152
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,960
commercial lots of 100 to 500 acres is largely non-existent.

153
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,560
While there are always thousands of acres of undeveloped land that's for sale throughout

154
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,720
the Midwest, the South, and other remote regions in the United States, these lots are generally

155
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,480
not zoned for commercial recreation or they're simply too far from any major urban market.

156
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,640
Any land in a metropolitan area these days that's still available, which could support

157
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,720
an amusement park, is just too expensive or worth far more being developed for residential

158
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,480
or commercial use.

159
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,640
Municipalities can also be an obstacle as any high-profile, land-intensive, privatized

160
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,680
recreational infrastructure like the taxpayer-funded sports stadiums of the past decade would be

161
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,240
subject to intense public and political scrutiny.

162
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,840
As an outdoors establishment, amusement parks are seasonal businesses where attendance,

163
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,160
engagement, and earnings are dependent on the weather.

164
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,320
Parks really only make money two quarters out of the year as a vast majority of business

165
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,280
occurs between the months of May and September.

166
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,720
What people often overlook is that the average amusement park is actually a regional business

167
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,400
that serves locals.

168
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,440
Disney and Universal are exceptions where their customer base are mostly international tourists

169
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,720
and out-of-towners making pre-planned pilgrimages.

170
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,280
As a result, location is even more important for conventional, non-IP-based amusement

171
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,840
parks as they need to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of a major metropolitan area where

172
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,840
locals can get into their cars, arrive before noon, and make it back home before midnight

173
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,400
all in one day.

174
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,680
Parks scale staffing by attendance and regularly bring on hundreds or thousands of minimum

175
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,440
wage unskilled short-term workers to operate in the high season.

176
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,560
In short, there needs to be a market with enough consumers and workers close by for

177
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,960
an amusement park to be successful.

178
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,920
Even if you get all the land, capital, planning, and rides in place, the only way to grow is

179
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,280
to keep spending.

180
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,920
Since the customer base is mostly going to be locals, they'll inevitably get bored

181
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,680
after a few visits.

182
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,760
On top of non-stop ride maintenance to ensure gas safety, renovation is essential to maintaining

183
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,320
engagement and driving retention.

184
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,240
If you have the land, you can always expand by adding more to the park, but more likely

185
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,680
than not, your option is to remodel the existing rides into newer experiences.

186
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,760
While renovations are never as expensive as the initial construction, remodeling is still

187
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,240
significant capital expenditure that costs millions of dollars every year.

188
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,200
To demonstrate just how real the barriers to entry are in this industry, in the past

189
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,600
40 plus years, there's not been a single new regional amusement park in the United

190
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,720
States.

191
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,960
Every major market in the country is already served by an entrenched player, and burning

192
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,880
over half a billion dollars to chase second place is a high-risk, low-reward strategy

193
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,400
that very few investors are interested in.

194
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,080
The last entrant was the Hard Rock Park in South Carolina that lasted just one year before

195
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,320
going under in 2009.

196
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,240
Hard Rock Park is just one of hundreds of other failed amusement parks in the world,

197
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,320
and now nearly 15 years after its closure, only one company, FedEx, has been able to

198
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,320
find some use from that abandoned land.

199
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,000
Given how much it takes to make a single park successful, there's no established third

200
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,520
party arrangement in the industry like franchising, where someone else will run the park for you

201
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,880
and give you a royalty when they're already faced with so much overhead and day-to-day

202
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,080
complexity.

203
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,880
All these factors have made it so that legacy parks like Six Flags have been able to stay

204
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,720
alive simply by virtue of having built their parks in the 70s or earlier.

205
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,040
Six Flags portfolio consists of both amusement parks and water parks.

206
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,880
While the number of parks under company ownership has gradually decreased over the past 20 years,

207
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:36,280
Six Flags remains the largest regional amusement park operator in the world.

208
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,120
On the West Coast, Six Flags Discovery Kingdom serves the San Francisco Bay Area and Northern

209
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,960
California while Six Flags Magic Mountain caters to Los Angeles and the greater Southern

210
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,040
California.

211
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,080
On the East Coast, Six Flags New England serves Providence, Boston, and New Haven.

212
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,680
Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey also caters to New York City and Philadelphia,

213
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,840
and Six Flags in Maryland hits DC and Baltimore.

214
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,720
In the Midwest, Six Flags Great America and Hurricane Harbor fill demand in from Chicago

215
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,920
and Milwaukee.

216
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,520
And in the South, Six Flags over Georgia is just a 20-minute drive from Atlanta, Six Flags

217
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:16,120
over Texas, Targets Dallas, and Six Flags Fiesta Texas cover San Antonio, Houston,

218
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,120
and Austin.

219
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,120
The coverage and entrenchment of Six Flags in these leading consumer markets make the

220
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,440
company an established, immovable legacy player.

221
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,000
What's interesting is that Six Flags has only built three of these parks themselves

222
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
with the remainder being rebranded acquisitions.

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,900
In this industry, first mover advantage is a true lasting moat, and the number and distribution

224
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,980
of parks across the United States, Mexico, and Canada enable Six Flags not just to make

225
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,820
more money, but also to safeguard against the weather and the economy.

226
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,180
If there's a local downturn or severe rain in one region, the other unaffected parks

227
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,100
can pick up the slack.

228
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,600
Since the 70s, Six Flags has had one main strategy, to have the most legendary, spectacular,

229
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,940
and thrilling roller coasters in the world.

230
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,260
Since the company can't compete on intellectual property, the focus has been on maximizing

231
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,620
spectacle.

232
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,420
Real Capital is the official tagline given to every Six Flags park, and the company

233
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,600
regularly pushes the boundaries of what's possible.

234
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,060
Every year, Six Flags introduces groundbreaking rides, with endless examples through its history

235
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,540
like New Revolution, which was the world's tallest roller coaster at opening in 1976,

236
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,420
Superman, which was the world's tallest and first ever roller coaster to reach speeds

237
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:30,860
of 100 miles per hour in 1997, X2 was the first ever fourth dimension roller coaster

238
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:36,660
upon opening in 2002, King Dekas in 2005 remains the fastest ride in the continent and the

239
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:41,460
tallest in the world, Zumanjara is the world's tallest drop tower, while the Goliath is the

240
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,460
fastest wooden roller coaster, both of which opened to the public in 2014, and the Jersey

241
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:52,300
Devil in 2020 broke records as the tallest and fastest single rail coaster in the world.

242
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,120
Quote, we believe that you should have news in every park every year.

243
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,620
This is different from what traditional theme parks do, where they'll put in a big coaster

244
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,260
in a few of their parks, and then they'll go dark for a year or two while they put coasters

245
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,080
in some of their other parks.

246
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,320
We want to have a new ride or attraction in every park every year.

247
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,320
Even though there are fewer Six Flags parks today than there were 20 years ago, this continuous

248
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,460
differentiation on spectacle and the company's unmatched scale have kept Six Flags up as

249
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,460
a cheaper alternative to Disney and Universal.

250
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:25,100
Yet the construction and design costs of these rides are not trivial, and the payback

251
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:31,180
periods are lengthy, as Six Flags invests over $100 million every year in capital expenditures.

252
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:37,260
$100 million annually is roughly 9 to 10% of Six Flags gross revenue, but 30 to 50%

253
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,480
of operating income, which is ultimately what matters since that's the cash you actually

254
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,580
get after day to day expenses.

255
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:51,340
Beyond having relatively more extreme thrill rides, Six Flags has tried to adapt to changing

256
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:55,480
consumer tastes by bringing in intellectual property of its own.

257
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,700
In an attempt to level the playing field with Disney and Universal, Six Flags has branded

258
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,980
its rides and parks over the decades with iconic fictional characters like Bugs Bunny,

259
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:11,300
Batman, Tweety Bird, Superman, and the Flintstones, a healthy mix of idolized superheroes and

260
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,980
family-friendly animations for appeal to both teenagers and families.

261
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,620
Like everything in the industry that we've seen so far, the cost for just renting these

262
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,940
IPs come at a premium.

263
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:27,260
Every year, Six Flags pays $3 to $8 million up front as a flat fee to Warner Bros, along

264
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:33,380
with a 12 to 15% royalty on all branded merchandise in exchange for exclusive rides to license

265
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,940
these characters at their amusement parks.

266
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,820
But just like their box office performance, DC characters just don't have the same

267
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:48,140
pull as Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, Nintendo, Harry Potter, Jurassic Park, or even One Piece.

268
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,620
While Six Flags has not grown at the same rate as Disney or Universal, company revenue

269
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,620
has been on a positive trajectory since 2002.

270
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,180
For the past 20 years, admissions has represented the majority of Six Flags annual revenue,

271
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,460
followed by food and merchandise sales inside the park, and then finally sponsorships and

272
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,900
licensing.

273
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:11,300
Revenue has been on a steady climb at 4% growth year over year for Six Flags, going from $880

274
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:17,220
million in 2003 to $1.5 billion in 2019 before the pandemic.

275
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,980
The numbers get interesting when we present them on a per-park basis.

276
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:26,140
In the early 2000s, the average Six Flags grows between $20 to $30 million every year.

277
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:31,700
In the 2010s before the pandemic, the average Six Flags park grows between $50 to $60 million

278
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,020
every year.

279
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,700
Roughly $30 million come from ticket admissions, while in-park food and merchandise sales make

280
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,740
up the other $20 million.

281
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:45,700
The average guest at Six Flags in the past decade spent roughly $40, with $25 going towards

282
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,540
entry and $17 on in-park purchases.

283
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,100
But before we go too far, it's important to contextualize the sleep in per-park earning

284
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,340
productivity.

285
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,900
While Six Flags has unmatched scale today, the company was operating at an even greater

286
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,620
scale 20 years ago, albeit unsustainably.

287
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,380
Starting in the 1990s, Six Flags took out over $2 billion of loans to chase first mover

288
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:15,060
advantage in any market possible, borrowing money to buy parks across the United States,

289
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,660
Germany, Holland, Belgium, and France.

290
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,340
Most of these acquired parks were not performing, hence why they had been put up first sale

291
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,820
in the first place.

292
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,980
Despite selling at multi-million dollar premiums, each park required millions more in post-sales

293
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,740
investment to reach their full potential, but Six Flags believed it uniquely possessed

294
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:38,140
both the capital and the expertise to quickly turn these assets around.

295
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,260
But many of these acquisitions were inherently constrained by being in markets that were either

296
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,700
too soft or already contested.

297
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,340
The contrast between Disneyland Paris and Disneyland Orlando to this day is a clear

298
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,980
reminder to the industry that there are insurmountable cultural differences.

299
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:59,460
The lifestyle-oriented and economical European just doesn't have the same appetite, demand,

300
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,420
and standard for amusement parks that overworked capitalist Americans do.

301
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,620
As Six Flags borrowed more money, bought more parks, took on more overhead, and invested

302
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,260
more every year to make each asset successful, the company was in reality digging itself

303
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,140
into a deep hole.

304
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,740
Debt skyrocketed to $2.3 billion and remained there for years, which was two to three times

305
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,900
the total revenue that Six Flags was bringing in every year.

306
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,060
Through the 2000s, Six Flags posted loss after loss and there were little signs that their

307
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,940
strategy was working.

308
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,500
While overall revenue increased with the addition of each additional park, costs also increased

309
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,420
in line at a near one-to-one ratio.

310
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,740
Six Flags did not generate enough cash from operating at times to even cover the annual

311
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,620
interest that was due on its massive debts.

312
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,420
Even in the years where Six Flags didn't buy parks, the company was still not grossing

313
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:58,060
enough to afford all the renovation and improvements that were occurring in its existing assets.

314
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:02,540
In a classic story of robbing Peter to pay Paul, Six Flags borrowed money from one place

315
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,460
to pay off debts from another, issuing millions of preferred stock to raise funds, selling

316
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,380
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bonds, refinancing existing credit lines and

317
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,580
using all these proceeds to repay debt and to maintain liquidity.

318
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:21,060
The company even went so far as to use some of the debt to pay out dividends to investors

319
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,700
despite being in the red.

320
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,260
And when Six Flags could no longer continue this financial equivalent of Russian roulette,

321
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,340
the company begrudgingly sold off its European division and abandoned underperforming locations,

322
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:37,620
going from nearly 40 parks in 2003 to just 20 parks by 2007.

323
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,180
Overall revenue improved with the streamlining as did earnings productivity as only the best

324
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,540
parks remained.

325
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:49,100
The average Six Flags park grossed around $40-50 million in the mid-2000s, nearly double

326
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,740
compared to that of the early 2000s.

327
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,820
But the company continued to kick debt down the road, the losses continued, and when the

328
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:01,300
Great Recession hit in 2008, it was the straw that finally broke the camel's back.

329
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,500
Recession parks have long sold themselves as recession-proof defensive businesses.

330
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,820
While airlines, cruises, hotels, resorts, and other traditional travel businesses will

331
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:15,400
lose customers in recession, the parks industry has pushed the argument that people still

332
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,020
need somewhere to escape to despite cutting back on vacations, and amusement parks are

333
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,900
unmatched in the value and the entertainment that they provide.

334
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,420
Despite the industry's positioning, fewer guests came to the park during the Great Recession,

335
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,440
and the ones that did show up spent less than before.

336
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,000
This drop in attendance and by extension revenue brought Six Flags to the point of bankruptcy

337
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,340
in 2009, but its parks remained open.

338
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:44,460
After a high-profile restructuring, Six Flags emerged from bankruptcy in 2010 as lenders

339
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,500
forgave over a billion dollars of debt in exchange for full ownership.

340
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,860
The new owners who were traumatized from this near-death experience aggressively overhauled

341
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,400
Six Flags' business model and pricing strategy into what it believed would be a safer and

342
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,200
more reliable variant.

343
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,960
This decision would bring success, but it would also dig the company into a different

344
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:10,920
hole over the next decade, and one that Six Flags is still trying to crawl out of today.

345
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,800
Six Flags went into the 2010s with the laser focus on selling memberships and season passes

346
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,040
over traditional full-priced gate tickets.

347
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,120
Memberships on paper were sticky, recurring revenue in which customers would pay an annual

348
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,040
fee to get unlimited entry and perks every year.

349
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,560
This annual fee was typically spread out into a flexible payment plan, so customers only

350
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,000
needed to pay out a few dollars every month to maintain their membership.

351
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,840
Season passes on the other hand also offered unlimited entry and a few perks, but expired

352
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,600
at the end of every season for a cheaper one-time fee.

353
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,000
These products were advantageous for the company in that Six Flags got to collect payment upfront

354
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,360
at the time of purchase rather than at the time of visit.

355
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,120
Even if customers didn't go to the park, Six Flags would have still made money.

356
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,600
From a psychology standpoint, it also reversed roles in that Six Flags no longer had to convince

357
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,960
customers to come as pass holders and members would naturally feel compelled to visit regularly

358
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,160
to get the most out of their purchase.

359
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,880
In 2010, a one-day entry ticket to Six Flags at the gate cost $30 to $40 and parking would

360
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,840
set you back another $10 to $20.

361
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,240
A season pass that year was priced at just $70.

362
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,400
In 2014, a one-day ticket cost $65, but it was a much better deal to buy the season pass

363
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,400
for $80 or to subscribe to a membership for $100 as those products included free parking.

364
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,240
As long as a season pass holder visited the park at least twice a year, they were saving

365
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
$50 per person.

366
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,440
In theory, everyone was a winner.

367
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,720
The value-oriented consumer felt like they got the best deal, fans felt like they were

368
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,440
being rewarded for their loyalty, and Six Flags got to collect and recognize revenue upfront

369
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,880
in a steady, reoccurring, predictable manner.

370
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:56,760
While Six Flags product strategy was to build as many groundbreaking thrill rides as possible,

371
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,400
their pricing strategy was all about value.

372
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,800
The assumption behind the season passes and memberships is that the lost revenue from discounted

373
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,160
admissions would be easily made up through in-park food and merchandise sales.

374
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,280
In the mind of Six Flags executives, the most important thing was volume.

375
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,640
With such high overhead and fixed costs, they believed it was better to fill each park with

376
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,840
as many bodies as possible versus gatekeeping over a few bucks in admissions.

377
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,640
As long as people were buying something in the park when they visited, those high-margin

378
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,280
sales would be enough to offset the ticket subsidies.

379
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,760
The problem is that Six Flags went overboard, aggressively discounting season passes and

380
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,040
memberships to substantially cheaper price points than one-day tickets while giving away

381
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:44,200
too much for free with free parking, skip-the-line privileges, and complimentary dining.

382
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,320
With this new focus on value, annual guest attendance for Six Flags grew at a steady

383
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,320
pace from 24 million visitors in 2011 to 30 million by 2016.

384
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,920
If we break out Six Flags revenue into its two main income streams, revenue from park

385
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:05,800
admissions grew the most at 45% in a nine-year period, going from $452 million in 2010 to

386
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,160
$815 million in 2019.

387
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:15,200
Food and merchandise sales grew slower at 40% in the same time frame from $348 million

388
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:21,120
to $574 million, which was solid, but not what Six Flags had been hoping for.

389
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,260
The company had been making every effort to keep ticket prices as flat as possible since

390
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,760
the Great Recession.

391
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,440
In nine years, the average price of a Six Flags ticket increased in line with inflation

392
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
at 17%.

393
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,960
In 2010, the average ticket to Six Flags cost $21.26.

394
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:44,960
In 2019, the average ticket to Six Flags cost just $24.86, which was just $3.60 million

395
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,880
more than what it cost nine years ago.

396
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,520
On an annual basis, we can see how sensitive the company was towards raising ticket prices

397
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,440
and how attached they were to discounting admissions.

398
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,080
In any year where the average ticket price increased, like in 2014, the company would

399
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,040
immediately push the cost back down in the following years.

400
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,880
Subsidizing tickets would not be a big deal if that spend was being recaptured in the

401
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:15,160
park, but the average spend on food and merchandise per guest had gone up just $1.00 and $12.00

402
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,280
cents in nine years.

403
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:22,760
Guests on average were spending just $17 to $18 per visit, and it was no secret why.

404
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,240
People were leaving Six Flags, going to their cars, driving to the closest fast food chain

405
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,000
to eat, and then returning to the park, or they were already coming to the park full.

406
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,800
Few people wanted to get ripped off with 10 to $15 plates of frozen chicken strips, fries

407
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,800
and pizza.

408
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,560
The budget-conscious value-oriented consumers that Six Flags targeted were especially conscious

409
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,720
not to fall into such traps.

410
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,320
While Six Flags showered its pass holders and members with massive discounts and perks,

411
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,600
in reality the company was never going to change the nature of bargain hunters.

412
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,280
Rather than improving the in-park concessions, Six Flags opted to simply slap dining onto

413
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:03,200
the season pass and memberships as a way to upsell and to collect more revenue up front.

414
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,200
For a higher fee, season pass holders could get two free meals, snacks, and drinks every

415
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,680
time they visited.

416
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,480
Headlines were made when a California man revealed that he ate lunch and dinner at his

417
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,680
local Six Flags every day for seven years using just his annual $150 season pass.

418
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,320
This man would drive to Six Flags, drop in for lunch, while this story and individual

419
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,020
is clearly an extreme, it's still an entertaining representation of the excessive discounting

420
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:34,640
and generosity that Six Flags engaged in during the 2010s just to fill the parks.

421
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,920
There was still enough up front and recurring revenue flowing in from memberships and passes

422
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,760
to keep the company on its positive trajectory.

423
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,400
Through the 2010s, Six Flags revenue grew at a positive pace while the bottom line returned

424
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,680
in the black compared to the red of the prior decade.

425
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:55,240
Roughly 1.5 million people visited Six Flags every year in the 2010s compared to the sub-million

426
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,960
of the 2000s.

427
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,000
Earning productivity peaked in 2016 as the average Six Flags park grossed over $70 million

428
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,640
a year with roughly $37 million attributed to admissions and the remainder to concessions.

429
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,560
During margin returned to positive digits, which was another welcome improvement compared

430
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,440
to the negative streak of the prior decade.

431
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,720
At this point, season pass and membership holders accounted for 50 to 60% of Six Flags

432
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,200
annual attendance every year.

433
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,480
The pass model was working as desired and the only thing left to do was to slam on the

434
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,280
gas pedal even harder.

435
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:35,440
In 2016, Six Flags began buying up water parks within a 150 mile radius to their existing

436
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,840
amusement parks with the only goal of selling higher priced combo passes.

437
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,560
The company envisioned that existing season pass holders who were in search of getting

438
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:49,280
the best deal possible would happily pay an extra $20-40 up front to get unlimited access

439
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:52,960
to a nearby water park even if they were unlikely to visit it.

440
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,520
In an all too familiar pattern, Six Flags once again began borrowing large sums of money

441
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:03,120
to finance these acquisitions and long term debt crossed the $2 billion mark once more.

442
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,880
While the water park roll-up strategy helped ensure top line growth, company profits largely

443
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:15,200
stagnated under this two park strategy as in-park spend remained flat.

444
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,200
To alleviate investor concerns, Six Flags leadership spun a growth story to Wall Street

445
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,600
that international licensing was this fast emerging, high margin, service based, asset

446
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,360
light revenue stream that could quickly help pay down this growing debt.

447
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,760
We did a study a couple years ago that looked at our brand awareness outside the United

448
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,760
States.

449
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,680
Six Flags brand recognition was very, very high, even higher than Universal and Disneyland.

450
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:45,000
People look at us and say that we at Six Flags have the success and expertise to open up

451
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,560
amusement parks.

452
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,120
We don't invest any of our own money into these deals, we're basically working with

453
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,280
partners who have access to land and funds to build parks.

454
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,520
We're paid for design and development, we get a set fee and once the park is opened

455
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,440
up, we get an ongoing revenue stream and management services and royalties generated

456
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,440
from the park.

457
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,000
There's no capital investment for us.

458
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,400
We start making money on day one.

459
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:14,680
The company proudly announced it had secured deals with partners in Dubai, Vietnam, Saudi

460
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,600
Arabia and China who had deep pockets and ambitions of their own to build tons of Six

461
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,640
Flags parks in their countries.

462
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,400
When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.

463
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,440
Like most private cross-border ventures, every single one of these partners turned out to

464
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,400
be either extremely naive or pure snake oil salesman.

465
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,640
The Vietnamese partner Navi Entertainment, an offshoot of a supposed plastic glove factory

466
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,680
vanished overnight just months after the announcement.

467
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,200
The Dubai partner pulled the plug on the Six Flags deal as they found out that they were

468
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,800
already losing too much money on their existing resorts and the Chinese partner defaulted as

469
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,480
soon as payments were due.

470
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,440
And while every other amusement park operator like Cedar Park, Disney and Universal have

471
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,920
all rebounded from COVID, Six Flags remains laggard as attendance and revenue have remained

472
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,200
below pre-pandemic levels.

473
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,040
The pandemic, for better or worse, accelerated the once reliable, value-oriented season

474
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,240
pass holders to critically rethink their spend with Six Flags.

475
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,160
Under the pressures of declining attendance, $2 billion in debt and a non-existent growth

476
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,320
Six Flags candid's longtime CEO in 2022.

477
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,360
His successor didn't mince any words, pointing the finger at the company's long-time discount

478
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,360
strategy as the primary culprit for Six Flags' present-day struggles.

479
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,880
Quote, literally, we have discounted too much, and the philosophy of filling parks was not

480
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,280
the right strategy.

481
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,120
At the end of it all, people did not have a good experience, it was not an experience

482
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,960
that people were willing to pay for.

483
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,200
We only got the discounter, and Six Flags became a cheap daycare center for teenagers

484
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,120
during breaks and summers.

485
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:52,360
We've eliminated many of our historical discounts, including free or ultra-low price

486
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,640
tickets, and are settling on an approach that balances attendance and revenue.

487
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,960
We have reset our strategy and operational priorities, and at a high level, we're focused

488
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,400
on providing a premium guest experience and will charge prices that are in line with the

489
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,560
value we deliver to our guests.

490
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:12,560
We believe we have pricing power, but only if we deliver an exceptional guest experience.

491
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:18,200
The average revenue per guest, both in in-park spend and admissions, skyrocketed in 2023

492
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,320
as going to Six Flags became a lot more expensive under the new CEO.

493
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,920
The reality was that while Six Flags focused on spectacle to win headlines and grab attention

494
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,040
and season past sales to keep the numbers up, the company completely neglected the core

495
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,840
guest experience.

496
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,440
Parks had become overcrowded with too many value-oriented pass holders who weren't spending, parking

497
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,800
lots were congested as too many people had free parking, restaurants inside the park were

498
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:46,200
taking up to an hour to serve their orders, concession quality had plummeted since food

499
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,080
had mostly been given away for free to drive season past sales, and restrooms were always

500
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,480
dirty since the park was always at maximum capacity.

501
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,920
Everything that wasn't a shiny new roller coaster was just old.

502
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,640
For instance, Six Flags is just now putting in digital screens that will display the real-time

503
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,520
waits for rides and restaurants, which is technology that Universal and Disneyland have

504
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,560
had for years.

505
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,880
There are several lessons from Six Flags worth reinforcing.

506
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:19,280
One is that it's a mistake to interpret every dollar and every customer as a win without

507
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,880
considering the quality of the dollar and the quality of the customer.

508
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,800
The former CEO ignored years of internal data that showed that guests who came in on discounted

509
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,640
tickets simply did not spend as much time and money as those that paid full price yet

510
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:35,000
took up the same park capacity.

511
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,880
This learning is applicable even in the world of media, where outsiders and brands tend

512
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,360
to equate every view as the same.

513
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:46,320
When the lens of either a creator or an advertiser is getting millions of views really a win

514
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,160
if most of those views are actually from teenagers who treat the content as a commodity for them

515
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,360
to kill time with.

516
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,000
In the case of content, the quality of the viewer should matter more than the overall

517
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,840
view count.

518
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,280
Traditional business thinking teaches that losing a customer is a huge negative that

519
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,400
should be avoided at all costs.

520
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,880
But in practice, churn in itself can be healthy.

521
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,920
Businesses will get better by accepting customer attrition rather than bending over backwards

522
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,560
to get customers to stay.

523
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,840
Discounting to keep customers paying or to get first timers in the door is an easy way

524
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:23,000
out that brings in short term success at the expense of long term sustainability.

525
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,040
With discounting, brands get diluted, the core high value users get neglected and all

526
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,240
the attention goes towards appeasing fickle, low value customers.

527
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,320
Yet discounting remains today a rampant practice across consumer and enterprise sectors as

528
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,320
companies continue to throw everything these days, bundles, perks and discounts just to

529
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,520
unlock the next subscriber or to secure that upcoming renewal.

530
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,960
In the case of Six Flags, the quality of the customer should have mattered more than the

531
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,280
number of customers at the park.

532
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,640
And despite 60 years of operating history, Six Flags is just now trying to quantify for

533
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,160
the first time what the real value of its parks are to the modern consumer, all while

534
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,880
Disney and Universal continue to raise the bar higher and higher every year.

535
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,840
The second lesson here is that the cost to generate any $1 of revenue is just as critical

536
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,200
as the conventional measures of margins and profits.

537
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,360
When we look at Six Flags' top line and bottom line, it looks respectable with healthy double

538
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,560
digit margins and billion dollar revenue.

539
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,160
Given the wary reception by the public markets, Six Flags has no choice but to lean on debt

540
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,560
over equity to maintain liquidity.

541
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,000
And the worst part is that every capital improvement in the amusement park industry, whether in

542
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,240
the form of ride renovations or food overhaul, will naturally be an expensive endeavor.

543
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,520
In the case of Six Flags, debt is not a lifeline or contingency or growth accelerant like it

544
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,400
is for traditional businesses.

545
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,560
Instead, debt is like an IV bag where the steady drip of funds keeps the company alive

546
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,800
even in non-recession, fair weather climates.

547
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,280
There is no lean methodology that can be applied to this naturally bloated and capital intensive

548
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
business.

549
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,640
And lenders will continue to let Six Flags borrow as the company's assets, notably

550
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,640
its land, still carry high book value.

551
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,960
From the outside, Six Flags has a seemingly powerful moat.

552
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,640
As no one can get into this industry, and if they do, they'll never be able to reach

553
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,800
their scale in 100 years.

554
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,800
But at the same time, the reality might also be that no one wants to.

555
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,720
These days, a startup will happily boast that they've reached $5 million or $10 million

556
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:30,200
in ARR, but if they also need to spend two to five times that amount to reach that milestone,

557
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:34,080
their business is likely not as robust or as momentous as they're making it out to

558
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,080
be.

559
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,400
And the only difference here is that the startup uses equity as their runway and has no collateral

560
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,040
to use debt.

561
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,240
The third lesson is that despite what Wall Street says, reoccurring revenue does not

562
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,080
inherently make for a better or stronger business.

563
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:53,440
Subscription revenue makes a financially safer business as churn is more gradual, revenue

564
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,720
is more predictable, and forecasts can be more sound, which are all things that only

565
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,640
investors care about.

566
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,760
If your product or service isn't good enough, people will still churn regardless of whether

567
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,640
or not they're paying $10 a month or $100 upfront every year.

568
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,640
The final lesson is that headlines never last.

569
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,400
Six Flags put millions of dollars every year towards building the fastest, tallest, scariest

570
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,080
rides for decades and spent millions more on making sure everyone knew about it.

571
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,760
The reality is that like all splashy marketing announcements, these record-breaking rides

572
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,520
all had relatively short-lived impact and were regarded by the public as one-time novelties.

573
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,800
Yet the mainstream spotlight and the continuous headlines over the decades gave Six Flags

574
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,160
leadership the false confidence that the company branding was so strong they could get away

575
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,160
turning a blind eye towards the core guest experience.

576
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,760
Attention is overrated, fame is fleeting, and the real value in business and in life

577
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,480
is always from the mundane, unglamorous, quiet work behind the scenes that you never see

578
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,920
on camera.

579
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,880
When you're not the mouse or the wizard, you usually don't get a fairytale ending.

580
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,920
But for Six Flags, they'll keep getting chances to write their own as no one else will be

581
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,560
entering into this industry anytime soon.
