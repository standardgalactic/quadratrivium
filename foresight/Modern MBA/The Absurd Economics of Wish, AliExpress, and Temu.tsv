0	9640	Timu is everywhere, promising that you can shop like a billionaire buying $10 wireless
9640	16680	speakers, $12 sneakers, $20 drones, and other unbelievably cheap electronics, gadgets, clothes,
16680	21600	all backed with the promise of free shipping, 90 day returns, 30 day price adjustments,
21600	23520	and deliveries within 2 weeks.
23520	27980	But Timu isn't the first to sell generic, unbranded low quality mass produced Chinese
27980	30780	products online at radically low prices.
30780	35100	Before Timu there was AliExpress and Wish, who both went to market decades ago with the
35100	40620	exact same value prop, wacky advertisements, incredibly low prices, counterfeit goods,
40620	42260	and shady sales tactics.
42260	47260	It all begs the question, how exactly do these companies stay alive selling 5-10 dollar items
47260	50440	online, and how can this business model be sustainable?
50440	54460	In this episode we'll cover the business of selling cheap, Chinese made junk online
54460	59500	through Wish, AliExpress, and Timu, and how all of this ties back to growth, greed,
59500	62700	and Silicon Valley.

142020	145540	Wish was the earliest player in the space, and while it's been long forgotten, the
145540	148900	company was once one of Silicon Valley's darling unicorns.
148900	153180	The company was an embodiment of all of tech's hottest B2C trends at the time.
153180	158820	Fueled by the craze of Groupon, Airbnb, Uber, and Netflix, Silicon Valley in the early 2010s
158820	162580	was a period of time where every startup called itself a platform.
162580	166460	Every founder wanted to build an online platform where all you had to do was to connect two
166460	170740	parties together and then take a cut on every transaction as the middleman.
170740	175140	Since the marketplace or the platform is made entirely of software, there would be no physical
175140	177940	assets or overhead to dilute profits.
177940	182180	The platform business in theory was infinitely scalable and that you could really capture
182180	187100	any transaction at any value and naturally achieve profitability at scale with enough
187100	188220	volume.
188220	192260	At the time, the shining examples of a platform business were Uber, who was applauded for
192260	197180	being the world's largest taxi company without owning a single car or Airbnb for disrupting
197180	201340	hotels with its platform without owning a single piece of real estate.
201340	206060	Wish sold itself as a platform that democratized e-commerce by connecting overseas merchants
206060	210020	to underserved low-income consumers who couldn't afford Amazon.
210020	215140	On Wish, you could get clothing, electronics, household goods, and other random items online
215140	218260	delivered right to your door at absurdly low prices.
218260	222060	Shipping was free, and some items were even as low as $1.
222060	225860	Wish was basically an online dollar store or discount store, where the main draw is
225860	227260	cheap prices.
227260	231940	Like Americans who shop at a dollar tree, consumers on Wish give up quality and convenience
231940	233460	in exchange for value.
233460	237700	The cheap prices on Wish made customers willing to tolerate the long shipping times where
237700	241620	products took two to four weeks or sometimes even months to arrive.
241620	245820	While Amazon operates its own warehouses, hires couriers, and builds its own shipping
245820	250020	network to ensure fast and accurate deliveries, Wish didn't want to get involved in the
250020	251020	logistics.
251020	255220	He placed that responsibility entirely on its international sellers, so Wish could
255220	262140	remain that lucrative platform with juicy software margins and zero overhead.
262140	266860	The main reason why items on Wish and AliExpress are so cheap is because a vast majority of
266860	271880	its merchants are Chinese manufacturers, wholesale and distributors, and the same is true over
271880	274900	a decade later with AliExpress and now Teemu.
274900	279500	Anytime an order comes in on Wish, these overseas merchants could simply grab the item, seal
279580	283380	it in a parcel, tack it on the customer's address, and then drop it off to the Chinese
283380	284860	Postal Service.
284860	288820	Since these merchants were A, mostly based in China with a significantly lower cost
288820	294540	of living, B, own cheap, rural warehouses or factories full of these generic, unbranded,
294540	299740	non-perishable, mass-produced products, and C, outsourced distribution to subsidized state-owned
299740	305460	postal services, they could still make profits selling items for one, two, or even $10 apiece.
305460	309380	Wish made no secret to hide this reality as you could always see from your packages when
309380	312820	they arrived that your products had been shipped from someone in China.
312820	317260	In the 2010s and before, shipping a package from China to the United States was actually
317260	321260	cheaper than shipping the same package from the West Coast to the East Coast.
321260	325660	This abnormality, or arbitrage, depending on where you stand, was the unintended result
325660	327540	of outdated legislation.
327540	332020	Mail within a country is generally run by one single public postal service, like the
332020	335240	USPS for Americans or La Poste for the French.
335240	340060	There are, of course, faster private alternatives like FedEx or DHL, but each country typically
340060	344520	offers a subsidized, government-owned, and run public service for its people to send
344520	346920	mail from one side of the country to the other.
346920	350440	But sending mail from one country to another is a lot more complex.
350440	355480	There has to be a universal language between each country's on mailing rates, limits,
355480	358180	dimensions, addresses, items, and so forth.
358180	360820	This is where the Universal Postal Union came in.
360820	366100	The Universal Postal Union, or UPU for short, was designed to solve this exact problem centuries
366100	370260	ago as an international co-op where world governments would come together every few
370260	375080	years to standardize and cross-border postal services so letters from one country could
375080	377040	be mailed smoothly to another.
377040	381460	That mail would still take weeks or even months to arrive, but the existence of the UPU would
381460	386020	ensure that those letters and packages would not simply be discarded or lost in the handoff
386020	388900	between each country's postal agency.
389900	395700	In the late 1800s before the internet and during the era of snail mail, the UPU was
395700	399700	essential for encouraging entrepreneurialism and international trade.
399700	404600	By having affordable cross-border mail, businesses and individuals in one country could seek
404600	409360	out import and export opportunities with individuals and businesses in another country, which would
409360	412840	be a net positive contribution to both economies.
412840	417720	Through the UPU, governments agreed on postal subsidies to keep international mail accessible
417720	420000	and affordable for its civilians.
420000	424140	The cost of sending mail from developing countries in the east to established countries in the
424140	427280	west was generally subsidized at the greatest levels.
427280	431020	The wealthy western countries were happy to foot the bill for these postal subsidies as
431020	435480	they had the funds to do so and they wanted to support the growth of developing countries.
435480	439540	One of these developing countries at the time was China, but once the internet took over
439540	445260	and email became the superior option in the 1990s, snail mail and the UPU by extension
445260	446500	became obsolete.
446500	451680	Nonetheless, the UPU and the postal subsidies of mailing from China to the west still persisted
451680	454520	and remained untouched until the 2010s.
454520	458600	Wish built their business on this abnormality, where merchants in China could tap into these
458600	463400	aggressively subsidized cross-border postal rates to ship items direct to customers in
463400	465520	the west at dirt-cheap rates.
465520	468600	But the UPU was designed for letters and not e-commerce.
468600	472020	They only regulated mail under 4.4 pounds.
472020	477000	This is precisely why products on Wish, All The Express and even Timu today are generally
477000	482920	simple small gadgets, trinkets, compact electronics or collapsible lightweight items that can be
482920	484920	stuffed into smaller packages.
484920	489040	It's these postal constraints that make it so Wish, All The Express and even Timu these
489040	493980	days in spite of their war chas, years of growth or massive advertising have never expanded
493980	501120	to the higher margin bigger products like furniture, home decor or appliances.
501120	503700	Like everything in life you get what you pay for.
503700	508220	Wish from its inception was intentionally hands-off in not just the logistics but also in products
508220	509540	and standards.
509540	513660	Wish was a wild west where merchants overseas were permitted to sell just about anything
513660	516340	that would fit within the 4.4 pound limit.
516340	520260	But what was most blatant was that merchants on Wish and All The Express were permitted
520260	524860	to use doctored, misleading or sometimes completely inaccurate photos and inadequate
524860	529780	product descriptions which inevitably led to huge mismatches of expectations and reality
530560	531560	for customers.
531560	536160	The harsh truth is that even if we wave aside the UPU and the artificially subsidized China
536160	540920	to the west mailing rates, these cheap, mostly Chinese-made, mass-produced products were
540920	543000	generally of poor quality.
543000	546600	Merchants on Wish and All The Express had to resort to these kind of tactics in order
546600	551360	to drive sales otherwise there would be little interest in these products in the first place.
551360	556480	Products sold on Wish and All The Express are generally non-essential, generic, low utility
556540	561980	novelty impulse purchases, which are no different from the random keychains, gadgets and merchandise
561980	566140	that physical retailers stock next to the candy when you check out at the aisle.
566140	569820	These products in short were never good enough to stand out on their own, and the lack of
569820	573820	branding on Wish and All The Express made it even more obvious that these products were
573820	578580	not really designed to last and that the merchants themselves were not in it for the long haul.
578580	581980	At the core, sellers on Wish and All The Express are flippers.
581980	585460	There are people who are just looking to move on as much volume of whatever product they
585480	590240	got their hands on as quickly as possible and as anonymously as possible, as their focus
590240	594720	is not in building a brand or forging long-term relationships with customers.
594720	599520	As a result, Wish could not build a platform with the same shopping experience of Amazon
599520	604240	or eBay where people visit with clear purchase intent and are looking to research multiple
604240	605520	brands at a time.
605520	609600	If customers did that on Wish, it would only reveal the low utility of the products being
609600	614280	sold, the questionable quality, and their short-lived availability on the platform.
614280	616140	But this is not a new problem.
616140	620300	Dollar stores and discount stores all around the world had solved this decades ago by turning
620300	624940	their shopping experiences into entertaining, unpredictable treasure hunts where customers
624940	631220	will happily wander shelves and dig through inventory to look for deals.
631220	635540	This is in contrast from traditional supermarkets where customers usually go in with a clear
635540	638340	to-do list and in search of a specific brand.
638340	643180	Wish copied the dollar store playbook by making their shopping experience also discovery-based.
643180	647920	When customers landed on Wish.com, they were immediately thrown into a never-ending, always-changing
647920	653320	feed of random cheap products of various categories to entice endless scrolling and impulsive
653320	654320	purchases.
654320	658240	But in Silicon Valley, saying that you want to build an online dollar store just isn't
658240	659240	sexy.
659240	663680	To get that billion-dollar unicorn valuation, you need buzzwords and a greater noble purpose
663680	666240	to show that you're not just doing it for the money.
666240	670560	Wish pitched itself as a disruptive startup selling affordable products to underserved
670620	675900	low-income populations who were too poor to either afford a computer or use Amazon.
675900	679940	Wish bragged about its uniquely mobile first and discovery-based shopping experience that
679940	683660	was built on a mode of proprietary data science capabilities.
683660	688820	The company boasted about harvesting millions of data points every day to fuel, store optimization
688820	693300	and personalization so that platform would always be adapting and present only the most
693300	697380	engaging, interesting and relevant products that had the highest likelihood to purchase
697380	699500	based on each user's interests.
699520	704000	And just like every platform startup of the 2010s, Wish boasted about having network effects
704000	708080	like Facebook, where the more users, the more data points on its platform, the stronger
708080	711760	its underlying data science would become, which in turn would translate to a better
711760	716720	shopping experience, stronger sales for merchants, and over time, organically bring in more
716720	719280	new users and merchants to the platform.
719280	723440	As we covered in the Under Armour episode earlier this season, data is not a moat, and
723440	726160	by itself, it can't make up for product quality.
726160	730660	The data science, proprietary algorithms, and shopping personalization that Wish bragged
730660	735140	about was fundamentally not any different from what Amazon and eBay had already accomplished
735140	737260	for their own platforms decades ago.
739900	744720	To dance around the inherent issues of product quality, slow snail mail delivery, and dodgy
744720	748300	sales tactics, Wish spun that the problem was you and not them.
748300	754780	Quote, while e-commerce grew from 3% of global commerce in 2010 to 14% in 2019, e-commerce
754780	759560	companies have largely focused on serving affluent customers by offering branded goods
759560	762240	and prioritizing convenience over price.
762240	767840	However, 44% of the United States and 85% of Europeans have a household income of less
767840	773280	than $75,000 and cannot afford many traditional e-commerce offerings.
773280	777680	Wish's point is that while you and I might think the products on their platform are inferior,
777680	782360	cheap, and crappy, we are actually blinded by privilege, and that the products being sold
782440	787700	are affordable, useful, and acceptable for low-income Americans and Europeans.
787700	792620	Silicon Valley ate up this story, and Wish skyrocketed into a multi-billion-dollar unicorn
792620	797900	in less than a decade, yet that same $10 billion private valuation would melt like a hot knife
797900	801140	through butter under the scrutiny of the public markets.
801140	805820	Like most, if not all, tech IPOs, Wish was essentially nothing more than a pump and dump.
805820	811340	Wish's valuation has dropped more than 99% since its IPO in 2020, but the venture capitalists
811360	814960	and founders have all made out with their riches, laughing their way to the bank as
814960	816480	the company burns.
816480	820800	The only thing keeping Wish from being delisted on the Nasdaq these days as a penny stock
820800	823320	has been a 30-to-1 reverse split.
823320	827440	While some of the company's decline in valuation can be attributed to the current recession,
827440	831400	the realities that Wish's numbers at IPO and even today are abysmal.
831400	835080	It's not a case of that the company just needs more time to execute, it's more so
835080	838760	that the numbers themselves are so bad that they just can't be improved.
838760	842500	No change in leadership or strategy could hide the reality that there was simply no
842500	844060	real business model.
844060	848420	For a platform startup that didn't own any warehouses, didn't handle any logistics,
848420	852580	didn't have any physical assets, and didn't really provide anything but software, Wish
852580	856700	was entirely unsustainable.
856700	861300	Like most tech pump and dumps, Wish had deflected concerns around sustainability by focusing
861300	865380	on top-line growth and promising that profits would naturally come over time.
865380	870960	The company had done just that in private, growing revenue from $144 million in 2015
870960	873680	to $1.9 billion at IPO.
873680	878640	Like Amazon, Wish makes its money as a platform by taking a 10-to-20% commission from the
878640	880680	merchants off every purchase.
880680	885280	The inherent challenge here is that taking commission off the sale of a $5-to-10 product
885280	890200	is a whole different ballgame than taking commission off a $40-to-60 product.
890200	895040	Contrary to Amazon, Wish needed to make up for its poor unit economics with sheer volume.
895040	900100	The VCs, Wish likely compared its trajectory to Amazon, where Jeff Bezos famously gave
900100	903180	up profits to reinvest into his platform.
903180	907100	And after enough years of investment, Wish believed that its own operating margins would
907100	909740	turn positive just like it did for Amazon.
909740	913780	The distinction here is that with Amazon, you could actually see the literal physical
913780	918580	output of what that money was going towards in the warehouses, distribution centers, and
918580	921140	offices that were popping up around the country.
921140	924600	Wish was just a software platform, which meant that all the hundreds of millions of
924600	928360	dollars that the startup was spending beyond its means wasn't going towards any capital
928360	931280	expenditures or long live assets.
931280	935880	Since 2015, Wish had posted hundreds of millions of dollars in operating losses, and these
935880	937760	losses were not improving.
937760	942320	Wish burned millions of dollars on basic operating expenses to keep its platform running.
942320	945600	While one might think that a self-proclaimed data science company would meant that the
945600	951120	company would naturally spend big on engineers, R&D made up less than 5% of annual revenue
951120	955700	and accounted for no more than 5% of operating expenses every year.
955700	960100	Companies will always invest the most in whatever they believe will lead to the highest returns.
960100	964300	If Wish had truly believed that algorithms and data science and personalization would
964300	968780	directly unlock greater spend and other business efficiencies on the platform, the company would
968780	971340	easily have put its money where its mouth was.
971340	976460	Despite being engineers themselves and openly declaring data to be its competitive advantage,
976460	980100	Wish's founders both knew enough not to overinvest in R&D.
980100	984760	But Wish, Peter Skowiski and Danny Zhang knew what Kevin at Under Armour didn't know,
984760	989080	which was that data science cannot unlock any substantial innovation or business value
989080	994600	and at best only generates marginal improvements.
994600	999560	Wish burned the most money every year in sales and marketing, which alone cost 70 to 90%
999560	1000880	of annual revenue.
1000880	1005320	That means that for every $1 that Wish earned in revenue, the company was burning 70 to
1005320	1008280	90 cents of that dollar on sales and marketing alone.
1008300	1012380	The numbers get even wilder when we segment out the advertising costs, which made up over
1012380	1016500	90% of the entire sales and marketing expense.
1016500	1020980	Wish had to spend so much on advertising because convincing low income consumers who are just
1020980	1025580	surviving to buy non-essential goods with their already little disposable income is
1025580	1027620	a predictably difficult endeavor.
1027620	1031100	The poor make for low quality customers in that they're low earners, they're tiny
1031100	1035940	spenders, they don't have the room and time for brand loyalty, they generally live extreme
1035940	1039400	lifestyles and are by nature just high churned users.
1039400	1044000	This was why Amazon and other e-commerce platforms before Wish had never bothered to chase the
1044000	1046280	low income market in the first place.
1046280	1050640	Wish had to regularly spend big to reach and capture this fickle audience, but the truth
1050640	1052960	was that these customers were worth very little.
1052960	1057440	At IPO, Wish tried to show off that their platform had stickiness and that their customers
1057440	1061680	were increasing their spend over time, pointing out that the average lifetime value of their
1061680	1065780	users had grown from $10 to $30 in revenue by year 4.
1065780	1069220	A $30 LTV per user is depressingly low.
1069220	1073780	If we assume that Wish took a 15% commission, that means that a user spent on average just
1073780	1076420	$50 per year on the platform.
1076420	1080540	Wish had to keep spending big on advertising to constantly pull in new users to replace
1080540	1085980	those that had churned, and even as the number of active buyers grew from 18 million in 2015
1085980	1091660	to 62 million by 2019, the company was not getting any closer to profitability.
1091660	1096080	Looking at Wish's financials, there was still some merit to the whole platform idea.
1096080	1099920	Wish's initial gross margins were high, especially in comparison to Amazon, as its
1099920	1103720	cost of revenue was really just the cost of hosting software.
1103720	1108000	But all those gross profits were chewed up by advertising, and at the time of IPO, there
1108000	1112720	were plenty of signs that Wish's growth strategy of burning billions annually on online ads
1112720	1117240	was at a point of diminishing returns.
1117240	1122300	Despite spending $3 billion in three consecutive years on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and
1122300	1127780	YouTube ads, the number of active buyers on Wish plateaued from 2018 and 2020.
1127780	1132900	Wish was burning more cash than it was generating every year, with net cash from operating activities
1132900	1135620	and free cash flow both in the negatives.
1135620	1140020	As we covered before in the Uber and Open Door episodes, unprofitable tech startups
1140020	1144900	typically used adjusted EBITDA as a way to positively spin numbers that look horrific
1144900	1147840	under generally accepted accounting principles.
1147840	1152680	Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins are generally quite dangerous, non-regulated,
1152680	1156960	untrustworthy metrics as each company comes up with its own definition, and they get
1156960	1161080	to cherry pick whatever numbers that will make their losses look better and their margins
1161080	1162080	fatter.
1162080	1166480	But Wish's base numbers were so rough that the company had no room to even maneuver.
1166480	1170960	Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins, metrics that Wish pushed as more accurate
1170960	1176300	representations of their business were just as bleak as the actual underlying numbers.
1176300	1180900	Even by the company's own charitable definition, Wish was losing money on every transaction
1180900	1185060	and nowhere close to profitability, despite being a software-only platform without the
1185060	1188100	costs and overhead and logistics of Amazon.
1188100	1191940	At IPO, Wish was led by its founder and CEO Peter Skowiski.
1191940	1196380	Peter's tenure was constantly overshadowed by news that were somehow even worse than
1196380	1197880	the company's numbers.
1197880	1202420	At the time of IPO, Donald Trump was the president of the United States, and he had designated
1202420	1206300	China as public enemy number one to the American economy.
1206300	1210580	His economic policy was built on the belief that other countries, most notably China,
1210580	1214700	had taken advantage of these historic trade policies and flooded the markets with cheap
1214700	1217540	imports at the expense of American businesses.
1217540	1222220	Trump's trade war extended not just to the import of Chinese goods into the US by freight,
1222220	1226700	but also to the same generously subsidized postal rates of mail sent from China to the
1226700	1228080	United States.
1228080	1233240	The US threatened to quit the UPU unless the China to US postal rates were changed.
1233240	1237400	Under intense political pressure, the rates were reformed and the average cost of shipping
1237400	1242600	mail and packages from China to the United States increased 50% overnight, threatening
1242600	1244720	Wish's entire business.
1244720	1248520	Chinese merchants could no longer maintain their same margins without raising prices
1248520	1253120	or now charging for shipping, both of which hurt Wish's ability to compete on cost as
1253120	1256640	a platform.
1256640	1261260	With such headwinds, Peter focused on involving Wish to be a platform that was less China
1261260	1266980	dependent to carry products with greater utility and to drive retention from existing users.
1266980	1271380	Under Peter, Wish expanded product categories, briefly experimented with bigger and more
1271380	1275660	expensive products like furniture and branded electronics, and recruited merchants based
1275660	1280020	in Latin America and Eastern Europe to reduce their reliance on China.
1280020	1284060	Business is fair in that you are generally compensated based on the value that you create.
1284060	1287680	If you want to make more money, you have to create more value, and you create greater
1287680	1289920	value by solving bigger problems.
1289920	1294400	When you pick only the easy problems to solve, you create and capture much less value.
1294400	1299560	Thus, if Wish wanted to stay as a passive, software-only platform with zero involvement
1299560	1303760	in logistics and product quality, the business performance in the shopping experience would
1303760	1305760	remain just as terrible as ever.
1305760	1309920	The company needed to create more value for its users and for its merchants in order to
1309920	1312600	have any chance of achieving profitability.
1312600	1317220	As a direct response to the postal changes, Wish began operating warehouses on its own
1317220	1322540	and taking on responsibility for first-mile collection and last-mile delivery.
1322540	1326460	Logistics quickly became fast-growing supplemental revenue streams where merchants would pay
1326460	1329500	to outsource delivery to Wish as the platform.
1329500	1334060	This greater control in turn helped cut down average delivery times from months into weeks
1334060	1338900	as Wish began storing more and more product inventory locally in its own warehouses.
1338900	1343320	Later even took a page from Western Union and partnered with local brick-and-mortar businesses
1343320	1347640	to serve as makeshift fulfillment centers so shipments could be batched and customers
1347640	1351160	could pick up the orders themselves to save on shipping costs.
1351160	1355600	Merchants could now also pay Wish for advertising services so that their products would be promoted
1355600	1357880	ahead of others on the platform.
1357880	1362780	These new revenue streams were all-in-truth table stakes for any modern online marketplace
1362780	1367460	and Wish was years late in this implementation, but late is certainly better than never.
1367460	1373240	By evolving beyond just one flat sales commission income stream, Wish surpassed $2 billion combined
1373240	1379920	in revenue in 2020 yet remained just as far from profitability as before.
1379920	1384360	Wish's gross margins declined dramatically as its cost of doing business skyrocketed with
1384360	1387560	the increased overhead and involvement in logistics.
1387560	1392000	Wish's margins have since continuously declined year-over-year resembling those much closer
1392000	1393640	to that of Amazon.
1393640	1398140	Wish's new gross margins, interestingly enough, as an e-commerce platform, are generally
1398140	1402380	lower than when you compared to the gross margins of product manufacturers and dedicated
1402380	1406540	wholesalers, meaning that you would probably make more money selling clothes on Wish than
1406540	1409540	you would operating Wish itself as a platform.
1409540	1414460	The IPO had shined a light on the various skeletons hiding in Wish's closet, the poor user
1414460	1419020	retention, the insane advertising spend, and the weak customer lifetime value.
1419020	1423060	At the same time, the era of cheap online advertising had come to an end.
1423060	1427880	B2C startups as well as thousands of other legacy brands flooded social media and drove
1427880	1432400	advertising costs online to record levels as demand exceeded supply.
1432400	1436880	These headwinds forced Wish to move away from its historic, reckless mindset of acquiring
1436880	1442120	users at any cost and towards a more sustainable approach of retention and expansion.
1442120	1446480	From 2019 onwards, the company dramatically cut back on its ad budget, yet it couldn't
1446480	1448320	afford to turn off the spigot.
1448320	1452320	Without the crutch of advertising to combat churn, Wish was compelled to take the first-ever
1452320	1456100	steps to clean up the wild west of a marketplace that it had created.
1456100	1459740	It was only in 2021 when Wish finally focused on quality.
1459740	1464060	They published standards for merchants to abide by, they started ranking sellers internally
1464060	1468620	based on their performance, and they incentivized merchants to think longer term with the promise
1468620	1472180	of low commission and priority placement for good ratings.
1472180	1476260	Wish was still the cheapest game in town, but the quality of users was still so dreadful
1476260	1480580	that the company had to even partner with Klarna to make its low prices and even lower
1480580	1485960	quality products more tolerable to customers.
1485960	1489840	To his credit, Peter actually seemed committed to taking on these challenges and publicly
1489840	1493240	admitted his past mistakes around personnel and strategy.
1493240	1497520	Quote, I'd like to remind everyone we're not satisfied with these results and the outlook.
1497520	1499200	We all know that we can do better.
1499200	1503240	We're taking action to improve our performance for the long term, especially with a focus
1503240	1506680	on enhancing the user experience and increasing retention.
1506680	1510320	We look forward to providing an update on our next call in November.
1510380	1512540	Yet Peter would never make it to November.
1512540	1517220	Instead, he was forced to resign as CEO by the board and just two months after being
1517220	1521300	pushed out, Peter resigned from the board as well and disassociated himself from his
1521300	1523020	own startup entirely.
1523020	1528260	In the exact same statement announcing Peter's resignation as CEO, the board publicly committed
1528260	1530860	to finding his successor in three months.
1530860	1535780	The speed at which Peter exited his own company and the equally hasty three month deadline
1535780	1540760	to find a new CEO suggests that Peter's departure was most likely unplanned, unfriendly
1540760	1541760	and chaotic.
1541760	1546220	But Peter needs no sympathy as he had already made out with his millions long before the
1546220	1547600	stock crashed.
1547600	1552840	Wish appointed Vijay Talwar, a former Footlocker executive to take over as the CEO of Wish
1552840	1554920	in January of 2022.
1554920	1559640	Vijay's qualifications and claim to fame was turning around Footlocker's online business
1559640	1563840	to become the shoe retailer's most profitable and fastest growing segment.
1563840	1567540	But these accomplishments seem a little overblown when we poke at the numbers.
1567540	1571980	Regardless, Vijay took the helm at Wish and publicly promised to turn around the sinking
1571980	1572980	platform.
1572980	1577900	Since rocket ship user growth and annual billion dollar ad spend was no longer realistic,
1577900	1582220	the company could no longer bet on volume alone to make up for its negative margins.
1582220	1586940	Vijay's first move was to lay off 15% of the company to reduce headcount and to improve
1586940	1588740	the chances of profitability.
1588740	1593960	His streamlining extended into geographies as Wish cut operations in 79 countries to
1593960	1598720	focus on better serving existing customers in North America and Western Europe.
1598720	1603760	Vijay's final contribution as CEO was to rebrand Wish to demonstrate to the world
1603760	1607360	that the platform was not the same Wild West as it was before.
1607360	1612160	Yet Vijay brought no vision of his own and was fired as CEO in September, less than one
1612160	1613520	year on the job.
1613520	1618680	And like Peter before, Vijay needs no sympathy as he got paid $6 million for nine months
1618680	1621860	of work.
1621860	1626420	Wish is now on its third CEO in two years in Jo Yan, a career professional who made
1626420	1631820	his name in Asia as the former general manager for Google and Stripe in mainland China.
1631820	1636300	Wish's business has continued to take knockout blows as the recession in the US, the war
1636300	1641900	in Ukraine, the prolonged COVID lockdown of China and inflation have all cut into discretionary
1641900	1644340	spending in Wish's customer base.
1644340	1648260	Wish had historically proclaimed itself as a mobile first platform as the only way to
1648280	1651560	sign up and buy things on Wish was through its mobile app.
1651560	1655760	Yet the company is now in a desperate state where every purchase and every user counts,
1655760	1659120	no matter from where, how little, or how few there are.
1659120	1662920	As a result, the company has had no choice but to lower the gates as customers can now
1662920	1666800	browse and transact on Wish without having to go through the mobile app.
1666800	1671720	The historic claim of Wish being a mobile first platform is now completely obsolete.
1671720	1675920	While Peter had relied on soft incentives to encourage better merchant behavior and
1675920	1680100	product standards, Joe has taken far more aggressive steps to clean up the platform
1680100	1684540	in banning low-rated sellers, capping the number of merchants on the platform, and providing
1684540	1686860	customers with quality guarantees.
1686860	1691060	Under Joe, Wish has tried to improve the core shopping experience by shortening delivery
1691060	1695740	times from four weeks to a target of two weeks, but this is only possible when products are
1695740	1699980	stored in bulk locally and not sent individually overseas.
1699980	1704620	The increased carrying costs of storing more product at more warehouses across North America
1704680	1708840	and Europe just to ship their product faster to customers' doors has only shredded the
1708840	1710560	company's margins.
1710560	1715320	Operating margins, net losses, and all the metrics by Wish's own definition have ultimately
1715320	1717400	only worsened over time.
1717400	1721200	Wish is truly an estate where they're damned if they do and damned if they don't.
1721200	1725720	They can't raise prices without alienating their core low-income customer base to improve
1725720	1729840	the unit economics, but they also can't bring in new users without modernizing the
1729840	1734600	platform logistics and improving the shopping experience, both of which are costly investments.
1735580	1740660	The harsh reality is that there is ultimately no magical strategy or solution to fixing
1740660	1742980	a business model that just simply doesn't work.
1742980	1750020	The logical question is that if Wish doesn't work as a business, then how is AliExpress
1750020	1751020	still alive?
1751020	1755900	The main difference between Wish and AliExpress is that Alibaba hasn't bothered to build
1755900	1757940	a big business out of AliExpress.
1757940	1763020	The main difference between Wish and AliExpress is that Alibaba hasn't bothered to build
1763840	1764840	AliExpress.
1764840	1769840	AliExpress was created around the same time as Wish to extend the core Alibaba platform
1769840	1773920	to help Chinese merchants sell directly to customers in other countries.
1773920	1778360	Wish targeted low-income households in prime consumer markets like North America where
1778360	1784400	e-commerce and product standards are all well-established, but AliExpress in contrast since its inception
1784400	1789520	has targeted emerging markets like Russia, Spain, and Brazil where e-commerce is limited
1789520	1792720	and product standards as a whole are underdeveloped.
1792740	1797580	AliExpress historically accounts for less than 5% of all of Alibaba's revenue and
1797580	1801940	strategically has taken a backseat compared to the company's other ventures like cloud
1801940	1803940	computing and entertainment.
1803940	1808220	But despite the minimal investment, AliExpress has come up with the exact same roadmap as
1808220	1813060	Wish over the same period of time, evolving from a Wild West marketplace with a flat
1813060	1818180	commission model into a gradually curated, localized, improved shopping experience that
1818180	1821140	provides logistics to merchants for a fee.
1821140	1825520	AliExpress's current goal, just like Wish, has been to shorten delivery times from weeks
1825520	1830360	into days and the solution is the same in needing to store more product locally on demand
1830360	1833880	rather than distributing one at a time from overseas.
1833880	1838200	Despite operating for the same amount of time and at a much smaller scale, AliExpress, just
1838200	1842360	like Wish, has never turned a profit, but it's of no concern to Alibaba as they enjoy
1842360	1847200	plenty of profits and cash flow from its other income streams to indefinitely subsidize
1847200	1848400	this B2C venture.
1848540	1855220	The most prevalent question is that if all of this is well known and public information,
1855220	1857420	then why does Timu even exist?
1857420	1861900	Why would any company throw in so much good money after the bad to chase a business model
1861900	1865740	that past companies have already proven to be largely unsustainable?
1865740	1869900	Timu is the latest venture from the Chinese e-commerce giant Pingdo-Do.
1869900	1875300	Pingdo-Do, or PDD for short, was founded in 2015 and is one of the strangest modern day
1875300	1876300	businesses.
1876300	1881440	If their numbers are to be trusted, this tiny startup somehow grew from zero to one of China's
1881440	1884320	biggest online retailers in just three years.
1884320	1889280	PDD gained popularity in China for its group purchase model where customers can pull in
1889280	1893280	friends and family into their orders so that they can increase the order quantities and
1893280	1895760	then collectively unlock greater savings.
1895760	1901040	PDD's success as a platform in China, if real, is as much a product of culture as it
1901040	1902560	is of technology.
1902560	1907780	While shopping is generally a solitary, personal, individualistic, and highly efficient activity
1907780	1912220	in the West, shopping in China is a more communal and social activity that's built
1912220	1917420	on the same collectivism and cultural isolationism of modern Chinese society.
1917420	1922980	The point here is that PDD as a platform in its design can only be successful in China.
1922980	1927780	As PDD has scaled, the company has followed the same predictable growth playbook of other
1927780	1930220	established e-commerce companies around the world.
1930400	1934400	They've used data to improve their product recommendations, to personalize the shopping
1934400	1939200	experience for users, to build out their own warehouses, to construct their own distribution
1939200	1944160	centers, to provide logistics to merchants for a fee, to sell its own private label goods
1944160	1948720	on its marketplace like Amazon Basics, and even rolling out a grocery delivery service
1948720	1949720	like Instacart.
1949720	1954240	PDD's main challenge these days is that the company has hit a ceiling in terms of what
1954240	1957200	it can accomplish by operating in China alone.
1957200	1962100	The only way to sustain its historic double or triple digit growth is to go overseas,
1962100	1966620	but the core group purchase platform is simply not translatable to the West.
1966620	1970620	More than that, it would only be foolish to go head-to-head against Amazon in its home
1970620	1975060	court competing for the same users, and especially as a foreign brand.
1977060	1981820	PDD has reaped millions of dollars year over year from the American equity markets, where
1981820	1986180	the company's rapid rise and impressive, non-regulated financials have painted the
1986200	1991280	pictures of an unstoppable, fast-growing tech rocket ship in the world's second-largest
1991280	1992280	economy.
1992280	1997160	Even though no American can even access PDD, it hasn't stopped retail investors from diving
1997160	2002840	in head-first and propelling Pindodo's valuation to even higher than that of Alibaba in less
2002840	2004040	than three years.
2004040	2009720	PDD's insane growth has fueled its radical valuation on the American equity markets,
2009720	2014140	which is in turn enable the company to sell shares at spectacular premiums, enriching
2014160	2017040	both shareholders and insiders alike.
2017040	2021240	But with their core platform now plateauing in China, the only way to keep up growth is
2021240	2022240	to enter the U.S.
2022240	2027200	But with Amazon firmly entrenched in the middle and upper end of the market, PDD's best
2027200	2028640	bet is at the bottom.
2028640	2033120	Quote, as we reach our current scale, investors should not expect us to continuously deliver
2033120	2034120	high growth.
2034120	2038840	As our user base reaches its current scale, our focus now is on how to serve our existing
2038840	2043560	880 million Chinese users and how to improve their trust and mind share.
2043580	2047460	Our team has started out roughly half a year ago, and given the early stage nature, the
2047460	2050500	financial impact from this business is relatively small.
2050500	2053820	We are entering new markets, so we need to understand customers.
2053820	2058420	Our team is laser focused on understanding and accepting different cultural preferences,
2058420	2063220	social environments, and consumer demand with the aim of creating more unique value.
2063220	2068300	Timu is young, experimental, and unproven, but that hasn't stopped PDD from promoting
2068300	2071140	it everywhere it can, even at the Super Bowl.
2071160	2075960	Like with Aliexpress and Alibaba, Timu only works today because it's subsidized by a
2075960	2077560	mature core business.
2077560	2082200	Timu's existence is fundamentally borne out of PDD's urgency to maintain its double
2082200	2085560	digit growth and to keep up its equity valuations.
2085560	2091000	In business, cost, quality, and speed are traditionally presented in the form of a triangle
2091000	2095120	where companies can realistically only achieve two of these things at a time.
2095120	2099320	No business can achieve all three, yet Timu is burning millions of dollars to challenge
2099340	2104780	this age-old paradigm by offering customers unprecedented speed, price, and value, promising
2104780	2110740	generous 90-day refunds, 30-day price adjustments, free shipping, and delivery within two weeks
2110740	2113380	or less to squash its weakening rivals.
2115900	2119660	Wish is a tale of not just another Silicon Valley pump and dump, but also a real-world
2119660	2123800	reminder that the software platform business is a myth and that online businesses are
2123800	2127620	not any more advantageous than traditional brick-and-mortar ones.
2127620	2131280	In business, we are all compensated based on the value that we generate.
2131280	2135720	When you operate as a software-only platform like Wish and like how many other startups
2135720	2138520	do, you're really only solving the easy problems.
2138520	2143000	Building a website and facilitating a transaction between two parties is ultimately not that
2143000	2147880	difficult, especially when the transaction is worth less than a meal at McDonald's.
2147880	2151880	Selling cheap Chinese junk is actually a proven business in every part of the world, whether
2151880	2156840	that's the mighty dollar store or the random peddlers that sell cheap souvenirs at tourist
2157740	2158740	destinations.
2158740	2162380	But when you try to do the same thing exclusively online, where visitors can leave just as fast
2162380	2166100	with a click of a button, where customers can't touch and feel what they're buying
2166100	2170660	and they have no intent or pressure to splurge, the work you have to do to build up that trust
2170660	2173420	and urgency virtually is monumental.
2173420	2177900	Only time will tell if Timu will be sustainable or if he'll be another flash in the pan,
2177900	2182660	but if the results of AliExpress and Wish are anything to go off of, the odds are completely
2182660	2184060	stacked against Timu.
