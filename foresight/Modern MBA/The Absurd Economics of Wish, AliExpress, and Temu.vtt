00:00.000 --> 00:09.640
Timu is everywhere, promising that you can shop like a billionaire buying $10 wireless

00:09.640 --> 00:16.680
speakers, $12 sneakers, $20 drones, and other unbelievably cheap electronics, gadgets, clothes,

00:16.680 --> 00:21.600
all backed with the promise of free shipping, 90 day returns, 30 day price adjustments,

00:21.600 --> 00:23.520
and deliveries within 2 weeks.

00:23.520 --> 00:27.980
But Timu isn't the first to sell generic, unbranded low quality mass produced Chinese

00:27.980 --> 00:30.780
products online at radically low prices.

00:30.780 --> 00:35.100
Before Timu there was AliExpress and Wish, who both went to market decades ago with the

00:35.100 --> 00:40.620
exact same value prop, wacky advertisements, incredibly low prices, counterfeit goods,

00:40.620 --> 00:42.260
and shady sales tactics.

00:42.260 --> 00:47.260
It all begs the question, how exactly do these companies stay alive selling 5-10 dollar items

00:47.260 --> 00:50.440
online, and how can this business model be sustainable?

00:50.440 --> 00:54.460
In this episode we'll cover the business of selling cheap, Chinese made junk online

00:54.460 --> 00:59.500
through Wish, AliExpress, and Timu, and how all of this ties back to growth, greed,

00:59.500 --> 01:02.700
and Silicon Valley.

01:02.700 --> 01:06.420
If you ship things, listen up, Rolo is disrupting the shipping industry.

01:06.420 --> 01:10.900
Whether you ship one package a year or thousands a week, Rolo provides everything you need

01:10.900 --> 01:13.540
to save lots of time and lots of money.

01:13.540 --> 01:18.220
Since Rolo cares about saving you time, they've asked to cut this normally 3 minute long sponsorship

01:18.220 --> 01:21.860
segment as short as possible, so here are the quick bullet points.

01:21.860 --> 01:24.620
More than 250,000 shippers use Rolo.

01:24.620 --> 01:27.140
There are no sign up fees and no monthly fees.

01:27.140 --> 01:30.300
Whenever you ship it will cost you just 5 cents.

01:30.300 --> 01:35.100
Rolo's negotiated rates with top carriers saves you up to 90% off of shipping rates.

01:35.100 --> 01:39.940
Get the exact same service you would get at a post office or UPS store with huge discounts

01:39.940 --> 01:41.500
directly on the Rolo app.

01:41.500 --> 01:45.820
You can even schedule pickups from your doorstep, so you never end up waiting in line at a post

01:45.820 --> 01:47.580
office ever again.

01:47.580 --> 01:52.940
Most businesses can connect all their selling channels, Amazon, eBay, Shopify, Etsy, and

01:52.940 --> 01:56.740
more, to manage and ship and track all their orders from the Rolo app.

01:56.740 --> 02:01.540
Rolo also has a patented, sleek thermal printer that requires no ink to print.

02:01.540 --> 02:05.300
It is an Apple Airprint certified and works with all your devices.

02:05.300 --> 02:10.540
Rolo is giving you a complimentary $10 ship credit with code ModernMBA1.

02:10.540 --> 02:15.220
That's code ModernMBA1 for a complimentary $10 shipping credit with Rolo.

02:15.220 --> 02:22.020
Thank you to Rolo for supporting ModernMBA and making this episode possible.

02:22.020 --> 02:25.540
Wish was the earliest player in the space, and while it's been long forgotten, the

02:25.540 --> 02:28.900
company was once one of Silicon Valley's darling unicorns.

02:28.900 --> 02:33.180
The company was an embodiment of all of tech's hottest B2C trends at the time.

02:33.180 --> 02:38.820
Fueled by the craze of Groupon, Airbnb, Uber, and Netflix, Silicon Valley in the early 2010s

02:38.820 --> 02:42.580
was a period of time where every startup called itself a platform.

02:42.580 --> 02:46.460
Every founder wanted to build an online platform where all you had to do was to connect two

02:46.460 --> 02:50.740
parties together and then take a cut on every transaction as the middleman.

02:50.740 --> 02:55.140
Since the marketplace or the platform is made entirely of software, there would be no physical

02:55.140 --> 02:57.940
assets or overhead to dilute profits.

02:57.940 --> 03:02.180
The platform business in theory was infinitely scalable and that you could really capture

03:02.180 --> 03:07.100
any transaction at any value and naturally achieve profitability at scale with enough

03:07.100 --> 03:08.220
volume.

03:08.220 --> 03:12.260
At the time, the shining examples of a platform business were Uber, who was applauded for

03:12.260 --> 03:17.180
being the world's largest taxi company without owning a single car or Airbnb for disrupting

03:17.180 --> 03:21.340
hotels with its platform without owning a single piece of real estate.

03:21.340 --> 03:26.060
Wish sold itself as a platform that democratized e-commerce by connecting overseas merchants

03:26.060 --> 03:30.020
to underserved low-income consumers who couldn't afford Amazon.

03:30.020 --> 03:35.140
On Wish, you could get clothing, electronics, household goods, and other random items online

03:35.140 --> 03:38.260
delivered right to your door at absurdly low prices.

03:38.260 --> 03:42.060
Shipping was free, and some items were even as low as $1.

03:42.060 --> 03:45.860
Wish was basically an online dollar store or discount store, where the main draw is

03:45.860 --> 03:47.260
cheap prices.

03:47.260 --> 03:51.940
Like Americans who shop at a dollar tree, consumers on Wish give up quality and convenience

03:51.940 --> 03:53.460
in exchange for value.

03:53.460 --> 03:57.700
The cheap prices on Wish made customers willing to tolerate the long shipping times where

03:57.700 --> 04:01.620
products took two to four weeks or sometimes even months to arrive.

04:01.620 --> 04:05.820
While Amazon operates its own warehouses, hires couriers, and builds its own shipping

04:05.820 --> 04:10.020
network to ensure fast and accurate deliveries, Wish didn't want to get involved in the

04:10.020 --> 04:11.020
logistics.

04:11.020 --> 04:15.220
He placed that responsibility entirely on its international sellers, so Wish could

04:15.220 --> 04:22.140
remain that lucrative platform with juicy software margins and zero overhead.

04:22.140 --> 04:26.860
The main reason why items on Wish and AliExpress are so cheap is because a vast majority of

04:26.860 --> 04:31.880
its merchants are Chinese manufacturers, wholesale and distributors, and the same is true over

04:31.880 --> 04:34.900
a decade later with AliExpress and now Teemu.

04:34.900 --> 04:39.500
Anytime an order comes in on Wish, these overseas merchants could simply grab the item, seal

04:39.580 --> 04:43.380
it in a parcel, tack it on the customer's address, and then drop it off to the Chinese

04:43.380 --> 04:44.860
Postal Service.

04:44.860 --> 04:48.820
Since these merchants were A, mostly based in China with a significantly lower cost

04:48.820 --> 04:54.540
of living, B, own cheap, rural warehouses or factories full of these generic, unbranded,

04:54.540 --> 04:59.740
non-perishable, mass-produced products, and C, outsourced distribution to subsidized state-owned

04:59.740 --> 05:05.460
postal services, they could still make profits selling items for one, two, or even $10 apiece.

05:05.460 --> 05:09.380
Wish made no secret to hide this reality as you could always see from your packages when

05:09.380 --> 05:12.820
they arrived that your products had been shipped from someone in China.

05:12.820 --> 05:17.260
In the 2010s and before, shipping a package from China to the United States was actually

05:17.260 --> 05:21.260
cheaper than shipping the same package from the West Coast to the East Coast.

05:21.260 --> 05:25.660
This abnormality, or arbitrage, depending on where you stand, was the unintended result

05:25.660 --> 05:27.540
of outdated legislation.

05:27.540 --> 05:32.020
Mail within a country is generally run by one single public postal service, like the

05:32.020 --> 05:35.240
USPS for Americans or La Poste for the French.

05:35.240 --> 05:40.060
There are, of course, faster private alternatives like FedEx or DHL, but each country typically

05:40.060 --> 05:44.520
offers a subsidized, government-owned, and run public service for its people to send

05:44.520 --> 05:46.920
mail from one side of the country to the other.

05:46.920 --> 05:50.440
But sending mail from one country to another is a lot more complex.

05:50.440 --> 05:55.480
There has to be a universal language between each country's on mailing rates, limits,

05:55.480 --> 05:58.180
dimensions, addresses, items, and so forth.

05:58.180 --> 06:00.820
This is where the Universal Postal Union came in.

06:00.820 --> 06:06.100
The Universal Postal Union, or UPU for short, was designed to solve this exact problem centuries

06:06.100 --> 06:10.260
ago as an international co-op where world governments would come together every few

06:10.260 --> 06:15.080
years to standardize and cross-border postal services so letters from one country could

06:15.080 --> 06:17.040
be mailed smoothly to another.

06:17.040 --> 06:21.460
That mail would still take weeks or even months to arrive, but the existence of the UPU would

06:21.460 --> 06:26.020
ensure that those letters and packages would not simply be discarded or lost in the handoff

06:26.020 --> 06:28.900
between each country's postal agency.

06:29.900 --> 06:35.700
In the late 1800s before the internet and during the era of snail mail, the UPU was

06:35.700 --> 06:39.700
essential for encouraging entrepreneurialism and international trade.

06:39.700 --> 06:44.600
By having affordable cross-border mail, businesses and individuals in one country could seek

06:44.600 --> 06:49.360
out import and export opportunities with individuals and businesses in another country, which would

06:49.360 --> 06:52.840
be a net positive contribution to both economies.

06:52.840 --> 06:57.720
Through the UPU, governments agreed on postal subsidies to keep international mail accessible

06:57.720 --> 07:00.000
and affordable for its civilians.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.140
The cost of sending mail from developing countries in the east to established countries in the

07:04.140 --> 07:07.280
west was generally subsidized at the greatest levels.

07:07.280 --> 07:11.020
The wealthy western countries were happy to foot the bill for these postal subsidies as

07:11.020 --> 07:15.480
they had the funds to do so and they wanted to support the growth of developing countries.

07:15.480 --> 07:19.540
One of these developing countries at the time was China, but once the internet took over

07:19.540 --> 07:25.260
and email became the superior option in the 1990s, snail mail and the UPU by extension

07:25.260 --> 07:26.500
became obsolete.

07:26.500 --> 07:31.680
Nonetheless, the UPU and the postal subsidies of mailing from China to the west still persisted

07:31.680 --> 07:34.520
and remained untouched until the 2010s.

07:34.520 --> 07:38.600
Wish built their business on this abnormality, where merchants in China could tap into these

07:38.600 --> 07:43.400
aggressively subsidized cross-border postal rates to ship items direct to customers in

07:43.400 --> 07:45.520
the west at dirt-cheap rates.

07:45.520 --> 07:48.600
But the UPU was designed for letters and not e-commerce.

07:48.600 --> 07:52.020
They only regulated mail under 4.4 pounds.

07:52.020 --> 07:57.000
This is precisely why products on Wish, All The Express and even Timu today are generally

07:57.000 --> 08:02.920
simple small gadgets, trinkets, compact electronics or collapsible lightweight items that can be

08:02.920 --> 08:04.920
stuffed into smaller packages.

08:04.920 --> 08:09.040
It's these postal constraints that make it so Wish, All The Express and even Timu these

08:09.040 --> 08:13.980
days in spite of their war chas, years of growth or massive advertising have never expanded

08:13.980 --> 08:21.120
to the higher margin bigger products like furniture, home decor or appliances.

08:21.120 --> 08:23.700
Like everything in life you get what you pay for.

08:23.700 --> 08:28.220
Wish from its inception was intentionally hands-off in not just the logistics but also in products

08:28.220 --> 08:29.540
and standards.

08:29.540 --> 08:33.660
Wish was a wild west where merchants overseas were permitted to sell just about anything

08:33.660 --> 08:36.340
that would fit within the 4.4 pound limit.

08:36.340 --> 08:40.260
But what was most blatant was that merchants on Wish and All The Express were permitted

08:40.260 --> 08:44.860
to use doctored, misleading or sometimes completely inaccurate photos and inadequate

08:44.860 --> 08:49.780
product descriptions which inevitably led to huge mismatches of expectations and reality

08:50.560 --> 08:51.560
for customers.

08:51.560 --> 08:56.160
The harsh truth is that even if we wave aside the UPU and the artificially subsidized China

08:56.160 --> 09:00.920
to the west mailing rates, these cheap, mostly Chinese-made, mass-produced products were

09:00.920 --> 09:03.000
generally of poor quality.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.600
Merchants on Wish and All The Express had to resort to these kind of tactics in order

09:06.600 --> 09:11.360
to drive sales otherwise there would be little interest in these products in the first place.

09:11.360 --> 09:16.480
Products sold on Wish and All The Express are generally non-essential, generic, low utility

09:16.540 --> 09:21.980
novelty impulse purchases, which are no different from the random keychains, gadgets and merchandise

09:21.980 --> 09:26.140
that physical retailers stock next to the candy when you check out at the aisle.

09:26.140 --> 09:29.820
These products in short were never good enough to stand out on their own, and the lack of

09:29.820 --> 09:33.820
branding on Wish and All The Express made it even more obvious that these products were

09:33.820 --> 09:38.580
not really designed to last and that the merchants themselves were not in it for the long haul.

09:38.580 --> 09:41.980
At the core, sellers on Wish and All The Express are flippers.

09:41.980 --> 09:45.460
There are people who are just looking to move on as much volume of whatever product they

09:45.480 --> 09:50.240
got their hands on as quickly as possible and as anonymously as possible, as their focus

09:50.240 --> 09:54.720
is not in building a brand or forging long-term relationships with customers.

09:54.720 --> 09:59.520
As a result, Wish could not build a platform with the same shopping experience of Amazon

09:59.520 --> 10:04.240
or eBay where people visit with clear purchase intent and are looking to research multiple

10:04.240 --> 10:05.520
brands at a time.

10:05.520 --> 10:09.600
If customers did that on Wish, it would only reveal the low utility of the products being

10:09.600 --> 10:14.280
sold, the questionable quality, and their short-lived availability on the platform.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.140
But this is not a new problem.

10:16.140 --> 10:20.300
Dollar stores and discount stores all around the world had solved this decades ago by turning

10:20.300 --> 10:24.940
their shopping experiences into entertaining, unpredictable treasure hunts where customers

10:24.940 --> 10:31.220
will happily wander shelves and dig through inventory to look for deals.

10:31.220 --> 10:35.540
This is in contrast from traditional supermarkets where customers usually go in with a clear

10:35.540 --> 10:38.340
to-do list and in search of a specific brand.

10:38.340 --> 10:43.180
Wish copied the dollar store playbook by making their shopping experience also discovery-based.

10:43.180 --> 10:47.920
When customers landed on Wish.com, they were immediately thrown into a never-ending, always-changing

10:47.920 --> 10:53.320
feed of random cheap products of various categories to entice endless scrolling and impulsive

10:53.320 --> 10:54.320
purchases.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.240
But in Silicon Valley, saying that you want to build an online dollar store just isn't

10:58.240 --> 10:59.240
sexy.

10:59.240 --> 11:03.680
To get that billion-dollar unicorn valuation, you need buzzwords and a greater noble purpose

11:03.680 --> 11:06.240
to show that you're not just doing it for the money.

11:06.240 --> 11:10.560
Wish pitched itself as a disruptive startup selling affordable products to underserved

11:10.620 --> 11:15.900
low-income populations who were too poor to either afford a computer or use Amazon.

11:15.900 --> 11:19.940
Wish bragged about its uniquely mobile first and discovery-based shopping experience that

11:19.940 --> 11:23.660
was built on a mode of proprietary data science capabilities.

11:23.660 --> 11:28.820
The company boasted about harvesting millions of data points every day to fuel, store optimization

11:28.820 --> 11:33.300
and personalization so that platform would always be adapting and present only the most

11:33.300 --> 11:37.380
engaging, interesting and relevant products that had the highest likelihood to purchase

11:37.380 --> 11:39.500
based on each user's interests.

11:39.520 --> 11:44.000
And just like every platform startup of the 2010s, Wish boasted about having network effects

11:44.000 --> 11:48.080
like Facebook, where the more users, the more data points on its platform, the stronger

11:48.080 --> 11:51.760
its underlying data science would become, which in turn would translate to a better

11:51.760 --> 11:56.720
shopping experience, stronger sales for merchants, and over time, organically bring in more

11:56.720 --> 11:59.280
new users and merchants to the platform.

11:59.280 --> 12:03.440
As we covered in the Under Armour episode earlier this season, data is not a moat, and

12:03.440 --> 12:06.160
by itself, it can't make up for product quality.

12:06.160 --> 12:10.660
The data science, proprietary algorithms, and shopping personalization that Wish bragged

12:10.660 --> 12:15.140
about was fundamentally not any different from what Amazon and eBay had already accomplished

12:15.140 --> 12:17.260
for their own platforms decades ago.

12:19.900 --> 12:24.720
To dance around the inherent issues of product quality, slow snail mail delivery, and dodgy

12:24.720 --> 12:28.300
sales tactics, Wish spun that the problem was you and not them.

12:28.300 --> 12:34.780
Quote, while e-commerce grew from 3% of global commerce in 2010 to 14% in 2019, e-commerce

12:34.780 --> 12:39.560
companies have largely focused on serving affluent customers by offering branded goods

12:39.560 --> 12:42.240
and prioritizing convenience over price.

12:42.240 --> 12:47.840
However, 44% of the United States and 85% of Europeans have a household income of less

12:47.840 --> 12:53.280
than $75,000 and cannot afford many traditional e-commerce offerings.

12:53.280 --> 12:57.680
Wish's point is that while you and I might think the products on their platform are inferior,

12:57.680 --> 13:02.360
cheap, and crappy, we are actually blinded by privilege, and that the products being sold

13:02.440 --> 13:07.700
are affordable, useful, and acceptable for low-income Americans and Europeans.

13:07.700 --> 13:12.620
Silicon Valley ate up this story, and Wish skyrocketed into a multi-billion-dollar unicorn

13:12.620 --> 13:17.900
in less than a decade, yet that same $10 billion private valuation would melt like a hot knife

13:17.900 --> 13:21.140
through butter under the scrutiny of the public markets.

13:21.140 --> 13:25.820
Like most, if not all, tech IPOs, Wish was essentially nothing more than a pump and dump.

13:25.820 --> 13:31.340
Wish's valuation has dropped more than 99% since its IPO in 2020, but the venture capitalists

13:31.360 --> 13:34.960
and founders have all made out with their riches, laughing their way to the bank as

13:34.960 --> 13:36.480
the company burns.

13:36.480 --> 13:40.800
The only thing keeping Wish from being delisted on the Nasdaq these days as a penny stock

13:40.800 --> 13:43.320
has been a 30-to-1 reverse split.

13:43.320 --> 13:47.440
While some of the company's decline in valuation can be attributed to the current recession,

13:47.440 --> 13:51.400
the realities that Wish's numbers at IPO and even today are abysmal.

13:51.400 --> 13:55.080
It's not a case of that the company just needs more time to execute, it's more so

13:55.080 --> 13:58.760
that the numbers themselves are so bad that they just can't be improved.

13:58.760 --> 14:02.500
No change in leadership or strategy could hide the reality that there was simply no

14:02.500 --> 14:04.060
real business model.

14:04.060 --> 14:08.420
For a platform startup that didn't own any warehouses, didn't handle any logistics,

14:08.420 --> 14:12.580
didn't have any physical assets, and didn't really provide anything but software, Wish

14:12.580 --> 14:16.700
was entirely unsustainable.

14:16.700 --> 14:21.300
Like most tech pump and dumps, Wish had deflected concerns around sustainability by focusing

14:21.300 --> 14:25.380
on top-line growth and promising that profits would naturally come over time.

14:25.380 --> 14:30.960
The company had done just that in private, growing revenue from $144 million in 2015

14:30.960 --> 14:33.680
to $1.9 billion at IPO.

14:33.680 --> 14:38.640
Like Amazon, Wish makes its money as a platform by taking a 10-to-20% commission from the

14:38.640 --> 14:40.680
merchants off every purchase.

14:40.680 --> 14:45.280
The inherent challenge here is that taking commission off the sale of a $5-to-10 product

14:45.280 --> 14:50.200
is a whole different ballgame than taking commission off a $40-to-60 product.

14:50.200 --> 14:55.040
Contrary to Amazon, Wish needed to make up for its poor unit economics with sheer volume.

14:55.040 --> 15:00.100
The VCs, Wish likely compared its trajectory to Amazon, where Jeff Bezos famously gave

15:00.100 --> 15:03.180
up profits to reinvest into his platform.

15:03.180 --> 15:07.100
And after enough years of investment, Wish believed that its own operating margins would

15:07.100 --> 15:09.740
turn positive just like it did for Amazon.

15:09.740 --> 15:13.780
The distinction here is that with Amazon, you could actually see the literal physical

15:13.780 --> 15:18.580
output of what that money was going towards in the warehouses, distribution centers, and

15:18.580 --> 15:21.140
offices that were popping up around the country.

15:21.140 --> 15:24.600
Wish was just a software platform, which meant that all the hundreds of millions of

15:24.600 --> 15:28.360
dollars that the startup was spending beyond its means wasn't going towards any capital

15:28.360 --> 15:31.280
expenditures or long live assets.

15:31.280 --> 15:35.880
Since 2015, Wish had posted hundreds of millions of dollars in operating losses, and these

15:35.880 --> 15:37.760
losses were not improving.

15:37.760 --> 15:42.320
Wish burned millions of dollars on basic operating expenses to keep its platform running.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.600
While one might think that a self-proclaimed data science company would meant that the

15:45.600 --> 15:51.120
company would naturally spend big on engineers, R&D made up less than 5% of annual revenue

15:51.120 --> 15:55.700
and accounted for no more than 5% of operating expenses every year.

15:55.700 --> 16:00.100
Companies will always invest the most in whatever they believe will lead to the highest returns.

16:00.100 --> 16:04.300
If Wish had truly believed that algorithms and data science and personalization would

16:04.300 --> 16:08.780
directly unlock greater spend and other business efficiencies on the platform, the company would

16:08.780 --> 16:11.340
easily have put its money where its mouth was.

16:11.340 --> 16:16.460
Despite being engineers themselves and openly declaring data to be its competitive advantage,

16:16.460 --> 16:20.100
Wish's founders both knew enough not to overinvest in R&D.

16:20.100 --> 16:24.760
But Wish, Peter Skowiski and Danny Zhang knew what Kevin at Under Armour didn't know,

16:24.760 --> 16:29.080
which was that data science cannot unlock any substantial innovation or business value

16:29.080 --> 16:34.600
and at best only generates marginal improvements.

16:34.600 --> 16:39.560
Wish burned the most money every year in sales and marketing, which alone cost 70 to 90%

16:39.560 --> 16:40.880
of annual revenue.

16:40.880 --> 16:45.320
That means that for every $1 that Wish earned in revenue, the company was burning 70 to

16:45.320 --> 16:48.280
90 cents of that dollar on sales and marketing alone.

16:48.300 --> 16:52.380
The numbers get even wilder when we segment out the advertising costs, which made up over

16:52.380 --> 16:56.500
90% of the entire sales and marketing expense.

16:56.500 --> 17:00.980
Wish had to spend so much on advertising because convincing low income consumers who are just

17:00.980 --> 17:05.580
surviving to buy non-essential goods with their already little disposable income is

17:05.580 --> 17:07.620
a predictably difficult endeavor.

17:07.620 --> 17:11.100
The poor make for low quality customers in that they're low earners, they're tiny

17:11.100 --> 17:15.940
spenders, they don't have the room and time for brand loyalty, they generally live extreme

17:15.940 --> 17:19.400
lifestyles and are by nature just high churned users.

17:19.400 --> 17:24.000
This was why Amazon and other e-commerce platforms before Wish had never bothered to chase the

17:24.000 --> 17:26.280
low income market in the first place.

17:26.280 --> 17:30.640
Wish had to regularly spend big to reach and capture this fickle audience, but the truth

17:30.640 --> 17:32.960
was that these customers were worth very little.

17:32.960 --> 17:37.440
At IPO, Wish tried to show off that their platform had stickiness and that their customers

17:37.440 --> 17:41.680
were increasing their spend over time, pointing out that the average lifetime value of their

17:41.680 --> 17:45.780
users had grown from $10 to $30 in revenue by year 4.

17:45.780 --> 17:49.220
A $30 LTV per user is depressingly low.

17:49.220 --> 17:53.780
If we assume that Wish took a 15% commission, that means that a user spent on average just

17:53.780 --> 17:56.420
$50 per year on the platform.

17:56.420 --> 18:00.540
Wish had to keep spending big on advertising to constantly pull in new users to replace

18:00.540 --> 18:05.980
those that had churned, and even as the number of active buyers grew from 18 million in 2015

18:05.980 --> 18:11.660
to 62 million by 2019, the company was not getting any closer to profitability.

18:11.660 --> 18:16.080
Looking at Wish's financials, there was still some merit to the whole platform idea.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.920
Wish's initial gross margins were high, especially in comparison to Amazon, as its

18:19.920 --> 18:23.720
cost of revenue was really just the cost of hosting software.

18:23.720 --> 18:28.000
But all those gross profits were chewed up by advertising, and at the time of IPO, there

18:28.000 --> 18:32.720
were plenty of signs that Wish's growth strategy of burning billions annually on online ads

18:32.720 --> 18:37.240
was at a point of diminishing returns.

18:37.240 --> 18:42.300
Despite spending $3 billion in three consecutive years on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and

18:42.300 --> 18:47.780
YouTube ads, the number of active buyers on Wish plateaued from 2018 and 2020.

18:47.780 --> 18:52.900
Wish was burning more cash than it was generating every year, with net cash from operating activities

18:52.900 --> 18:55.620
and free cash flow both in the negatives.

18:55.620 --> 19:00.020
As we covered before in the Uber and Open Door episodes, unprofitable tech startups

19:00.020 --> 19:04.900
typically used adjusted EBITDA as a way to positively spin numbers that look horrific

19:04.900 --> 19:07.840
under generally accepted accounting principles.

19:07.840 --> 19:12.680
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins are generally quite dangerous, non-regulated,

19:12.680 --> 19:16.960
untrustworthy metrics as each company comes up with its own definition, and they get

19:16.960 --> 19:21.080
to cherry pick whatever numbers that will make their losses look better and their margins

19:21.080 --> 19:22.080
fatter.

19:22.080 --> 19:26.480
But Wish's base numbers were so rough that the company had no room to even maneuver.

19:26.480 --> 19:30.960
Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins, metrics that Wish pushed as more accurate

19:30.960 --> 19:36.300
representations of their business were just as bleak as the actual underlying numbers.

19:36.300 --> 19:40.900
Even by the company's own charitable definition, Wish was losing money on every transaction

19:40.900 --> 19:45.060
and nowhere close to profitability, despite being a software-only platform without the

19:45.060 --> 19:48.100
costs and overhead and logistics of Amazon.

19:48.100 --> 19:51.940
At IPO, Wish was led by its founder and CEO Peter Skowiski.

19:51.940 --> 19:56.380
Peter's tenure was constantly overshadowed by news that were somehow even worse than

19:56.380 --> 19:57.880
the company's numbers.

19:57.880 --> 20:02.420
At the time of IPO, Donald Trump was the president of the United States, and he had designated

20:02.420 --> 20:06.300
China as public enemy number one to the American economy.

20:06.300 --> 20:10.580
His economic policy was built on the belief that other countries, most notably China,

20:10.580 --> 20:14.700
had taken advantage of these historic trade policies and flooded the markets with cheap

20:14.700 --> 20:17.540
imports at the expense of American businesses.

20:17.540 --> 20:22.220
Trump's trade war extended not just to the import of Chinese goods into the US by freight,

20:22.220 --> 20:26.700
but also to the same generously subsidized postal rates of mail sent from China to the

20:26.700 --> 20:28.080
United States.

20:28.080 --> 20:33.240
The US threatened to quit the UPU unless the China to US postal rates were changed.

20:33.240 --> 20:37.400
Under intense political pressure, the rates were reformed and the average cost of shipping

20:37.400 --> 20:42.600
mail and packages from China to the United States increased 50% overnight, threatening

20:42.600 --> 20:44.720
Wish's entire business.

20:44.720 --> 20:48.520
Chinese merchants could no longer maintain their same margins without raising prices

20:48.520 --> 20:53.120
or now charging for shipping, both of which hurt Wish's ability to compete on cost as

20:53.120 --> 20:56.640
a platform.

20:56.640 --> 21:01.260
With such headwinds, Peter focused on involving Wish to be a platform that was less China

21:01.260 --> 21:06.980
dependent to carry products with greater utility and to drive retention from existing users.

21:06.980 --> 21:11.380
Under Peter, Wish expanded product categories, briefly experimented with bigger and more

21:11.380 --> 21:15.660
expensive products like furniture and branded electronics, and recruited merchants based

21:15.660 --> 21:20.020
in Latin America and Eastern Europe to reduce their reliance on China.

21:20.020 --> 21:24.060
Business is fair in that you are generally compensated based on the value that you create.

21:24.060 --> 21:27.680
If you want to make more money, you have to create more value, and you create greater

21:27.680 --> 21:29.920
value by solving bigger problems.

21:29.920 --> 21:34.400
When you pick only the easy problems to solve, you create and capture much less value.

21:34.400 --> 21:39.560
Thus, if Wish wanted to stay as a passive, software-only platform with zero involvement

21:39.560 --> 21:43.760
in logistics and product quality, the business performance in the shopping experience would

21:43.760 --> 21:45.760
remain just as terrible as ever.

21:45.760 --> 21:49.920
The company needed to create more value for its users and for its merchants in order to

21:49.920 --> 21:52.600
have any chance of achieving profitability.

21:52.600 --> 21:57.220
As a direct response to the postal changes, Wish began operating warehouses on its own

21:57.220 --> 22:02.540
and taking on responsibility for first-mile collection and last-mile delivery.

22:02.540 --> 22:06.460
Logistics quickly became fast-growing supplemental revenue streams where merchants would pay

22:06.460 --> 22:09.500
to outsource delivery to Wish as the platform.

22:09.500 --> 22:14.060
This greater control in turn helped cut down average delivery times from months into weeks

22:14.060 --> 22:18.900
as Wish began storing more and more product inventory locally in its own warehouses.

22:18.900 --> 22:23.320
Later even took a page from Western Union and partnered with local brick-and-mortar businesses

22:23.320 --> 22:27.640
to serve as makeshift fulfillment centers so shipments could be batched and customers

22:27.640 --> 22:31.160
could pick up the orders themselves to save on shipping costs.

22:31.160 --> 22:35.600
Merchants could now also pay Wish for advertising services so that their products would be promoted

22:35.600 --> 22:37.880
ahead of others on the platform.

22:37.880 --> 22:42.780
These new revenue streams were all-in-truth table stakes for any modern online marketplace

22:42.780 --> 22:47.460
and Wish was years late in this implementation, but late is certainly better than never.

22:47.460 --> 22:53.240
By evolving beyond just one flat sales commission income stream, Wish surpassed $2 billion combined

22:53.240 --> 22:59.920
in revenue in 2020 yet remained just as far from profitability as before.

22:59.920 --> 23:04.360
Wish's gross margins declined dramatically as its cost of doing business skyrocketed with

23:04.360 --> 23:07.560
the increased overhead and involvement in logistics.

23:07.560 --> 23:12.000
Wish's margins have since continuously declined year-over-year resembling those much closer

23:12.000 --> 23:13.640
to that of Amazon.

23:13.640 --> 23:18.140
Wish's new gross margins, interestingly enough, as an e-commerce platform, are generally

23:18.140 --> 23:22.380
lower than when you compared to the gross margins of product manufacturers and dedicated

23:22.380 --> 23:26.540
wholesalers, meaning that you would probably make more money selling clothes on Wish than

23:26.540 --> 23:29.540
you would operating Wish itself as a platform.

23:29.540 --> 23:34.460
The IPO had shined a light on the various skeletons hiding in Wish's closet, the poor user

23:34.460 --> 23:39.020
retention, the insane advertising spend, and the weak customer lifetime value.

23:39.020 --> 23:43.060
At the same time, the era of cheap online advertising had come to an end.

23:43.060 --> 23:47.880
B2C startups as well as thousands of other legacy brands flooded social media and drove

23:47.880 --> 23:52.400
advertising costs online to record levels as demand exceeded supply.

23:52.400 --> 23:56.880
These headwinds forced Wish to move away from its historic, reckless mindset of acquiring

23:56.880 --> 24:02.120
users at any cost and towards a more sustainable approach of retention and expansion.

24:02.120 --> 24:06.480
From 2019 onwards, the company dramatically cut back on its ad budget, yet it couldn't

24:06.480 --> 24:08.320
afford to turn off the spigot.

24:08.320 --> 24:12.320
Without the crutch of advertising to combat churn, Wish was compelled to take the first-ever

24:12.320 --> 24:16.100
steps to clean up the wild west of a marketplace that it had created.

24:16.100 --> 24:19.740
It was only in 2021 when Wish finally focused on quality.

24:19.740 --> 24:24.060
They published standards for merchants to abide by, they started ranking sellers internally

24:24.060 --> 24:28.620
based on their performance, and they incentivized merchants to think longer term with the promise

24:28.620 --> 24:32.180
of low commission and priority placement for good ratings.

24:32.180 --> 24:36.260
Wish was still the cheapest game in town, but the quality of users was still so dreadful

24:36.260 --> 24:40.580
that the company had to even partner with Klarna to make its low prices and even lower

24:40.580 --> 24:45.960
quality products more tolerable to customers.

24:45.960 --> 24:49.840
To his credit, Peter actually seemed committed to taking on these challenges and publicly

24:49.840 --> 24:53.240
admitted his past mistakes around personnel and strategy.

24:53.240 --> 24:57.520
Quote, I'd like to remind everyone we're not satisfied with these results and the outlook.

24:57.520 --> 24:59.200
We all know that we can do better.

24:59.200 --> 25:03.240
We're taking action to improve our performance for the long term, especially with a focus

25:03.240 --> 25:06.680
on enhancing the user experience and increasing retention.

25:06.680 --> 25:10.320
We look forward to providing an update on our next call in November.

25:10.380 --> 25:12.540
Yet Peter would never make it to November.

25:12.540 --> 25:17.220
Instead, he was forced to resign as CEO by the board and just two months after being

25:17.220 --> 25:21.300
pushed out, Peter resigned from the board as well and disassociated himself from his

25:21.300 --> 25:23.020
own startup entirely.

25:23.020 --> 25:28.260
In the exact same statement announcing Peter's resignation as CEO, the board publicly committed

25:28.260 --> 25:30.860
to finding his successor in three months.

25:30.860 --> 25:35.780
The speed at which Peter exited his own company and the equally hasty three month deadline

25:35.780 --> 25:40.760
to find a new CEO suggests that Peter's departure was most likely unplanned, unfriendly

25:40.760 --> 25:41.760
and chaotic.

25:41.760 --> 25:46.220
But Peter needs no sympathy as he had already made out with his millions long before the

25:46.220 --> 25:47.600
stock crashed.

25:47.600 --> 25:52.840
Wish appointed Vijay Talwar, a former Footlocker executive to take over as the CEO of Wish

25:52.840 --> 25:54.920
in January of 2022.

25:54.920 --> 25:59.640
Vijay's qualifications and claim to fame was turning around Footlocker's online business

25:59.640 --> 26:03.840
to become the shoe retailer's most profitable and fastest growing segment.

26:03.840 --> 26:07.540
But these accomplishments seem a little overblown when we poke at the numbers.

26:07.540 --> 26:11.980
Regardless, Vijay took the helm at Wish and publicly promised to turn around the sinking

26:11.980 --> 26:12.980
platform.

26:12.980 --> 26:17.900
Since rocket ship user growth and annual billion dollar ad spend was no longer realistic,

26:17.900 --> 26:22.220
the company could no longer bet on volume alone to make up for its negative margins.

26:22.220 --> 26:26.940
Vijay's first move was to lay off 15% of the company to reduce headcount and to improve

26:26.940 --> 26:28.740
the chances of profitability.

26:28.740 --> 26:33.960
His streamlining extended into geographies as Wish cut operations in 79 countries to

26:33.960 --> 26:38.720
focus on better serving existing customers in North America and Western Europe.

26:38.720 --> 26:43.760
Vijay's final contribution as CEO was to rebrand Wish to demonstrate to the world

26:43.760 --> 26:47.360
that the platform was not the same Wild West as it was before.

26:47.360 --> 26:52.160
Yet Vijay brought no vision of his own and was fired as CEO in September, less than one

26:52.160 --> 26:53.520
year on the job.

26:53.520 --> 26:58.680
And like Peter before, Vijay needs no sympathy as he got paid $6 million for nine months

26:58.680 --> 27:01.860
of work.

27:01.860 --> 27:06.420
Wish is now on its third CEO in two years in Jo Yan, a career professional who made

27:06.420 --> 27:11.820
his name in Asia as the former general manager for Google and Stripe in mainland China.

27:11.820 --> 27:16.300
Wish's business has continued to take knockout blows as the recession in the US, the war

27:16.300 --> 27:21.900
in Ukraine, the prolonged COVID lockdown of China and inflation have all cut into discretionary

27:21.900 --> 27:24.340
spending in Wish's customer base.

27:24.340 --> 27:28.260
Wish had historically proclaimed itself as a mobile first platform as the only way to

27:28.280 --> 27:31.560
sign up and buy things on Wish was through its mobile app.

27:31.560 --> 27:35.760
Yet the company is now in a desperate state where every purchase and every user counts,

27:35.760 --> 27:39.120
no matter from where, how little, or how few there are.

27:39.120 --> 27:42.920
As a result, the company has had no choice but to lower the gates as customers can now

27:42.920 --> 27:46.800
browse and transact on Wish without having to go through the mobile app.

27:46.800 --> 27:51.720
The historic claim of Wish being a mobile first platform is now completely obsolete.

27:51.720 --> 27:55.920
While Peter had relied on soft incentives to encourage better merchant behavior and

27:55.920 --> 28:00.100
product standards, Joe has taken far more aggressive steps to clean up the platform

28:00.100 --> 28:04.540
in banning low-rated sellers, capping the number of merchants on the platform, and providing

28:04.540 --> 28:06.860
customers with quality guarantees.

28:06.860 --> 28:11.060
Under Joe, Wish has tried to improve the core shopping experience by shortening delivery

28:11.060 --> 28:15.740
times from four weeks to a target of two weeks, but this is only possible when products are

28:15.740 --> 28:19.980
stored in bulk locally and not sent individually overseas.

28:19.980 --> 28:24.620
The increased carrying costs of storing more product at more warehouses across North America

28:24.680 --> 28:28.840
and Europe just to ship their product faster to customers' doors has only shredded the

28:28.840 --> 28:30.560
company's margins.

28:30.560 --> 28:35.320
Operating margins, net losses, and all the metrics by Wish's own definition have ultimately

28:35.320 --> 28:37.400
only worsened over time.

28:37.400 --> 28:41.200
Wish is truly an estate where they're damned if they do and damned if they don't.

28:41.200 --> 28:45.720
They can't raise prices without alienating their core low-income customer base to improve

28:45.720 --> 28:49.840
the unit economics, but they also can't bring in new users without modernizing the

28:49.840 --> 28:54.600
platform logistics and improving the shopping experience, both of which are costly investments.

28:55.580 --> 29:00.660
The harsh reality is that there is ultimately no magical strategy or solution to fixing

29:00.660 --> 29:02.980
a business model that just simply doesn't work.

29:02.980 --> 29:10.020
The logical question is that if Wish doesn't work as a business, then how is AliExpress

29:10.020 --> 29:11.020
still alive?

29:11.020 --> 29:15.900
The main difference between Wish and AliExpress is that Alibaba hasn't bothered to build

29:15.900 --> 29:17.940
a big business out of AliExpress.

29:17.940 --> 29:23.020
The main difference between Wish and AliExpress is that Alibaba hasn't bothered to build

29:23.840 --> 29:24.840
AliExpress.

29:24.840 --> 29:29.840
AliExpress was created around the same time as Wish to extend the core Alibaba platform

29:29.840 --> 29:33.920
to help Chinese merchants sell directly to customers in other countries.

29:33.920 --> 29:38.360
Wish targeted low-income households in prime consumer markets like North America where

29:38.360 --> 29:44.400
e-commerce and product standards are all well-established, but AliExpress in contrast since its inception

29:44.400 --> 29:49.520
has targeted emerging markets like Russia, Spain, and Brazil where e-commerce is limited

29:49.520 --> 29:52.720
and product standards as a whole are underdeveloped.

29:52.740 --> 29:57.580
AliExpress historically accounts for less than 5% of all of Alibaba's revenue and

29:57.580 --> 30:01.940
strategically has taken a backseat compared to the company's other ventures like cloud

30:01.940 --> 30:03.940
computing and entertainment.

30:03.940 --> 30:08.220
But despite the minimal investment, AliExpress has come up with the exact same roadmap as

30:08.220 --> 30:13.060
Wish over the same period of time, evolving from a Wild West marketplace with a flat

30:13.060 --> 30:18.180
commission model into a gradually curated, localized, improved shopping experience that

30:18.180 --> 30:21.140
provides logistics to merchants for a fee.

30:21.140 --> 30:25.520
AliExpress's current goal, just like Wish, has been to shorten delivery times from weeks

30:25.520 --> 30:30.360
into days and the solution is the same in needing to store more product locally on demand

30:30.360 --> 30:33.880
rather than distributing one at a time from overseas.

30:33.880 --> 30:38.200
Despite operating for the same amount of time and at a much smaller scale, AliExpress, just

30:38.200 --> 30:42.360
like Wish, has never turned a profit, but it's of no concern to Alibaba as they enjoy

30:42.360 --> 30:47.200
plenty of profits and cash flow from its other income streams to indefinitely subsidize

30:47.200 --> 30:48.400
this B2C venture.

30:48.540 --> 30:55.220
The most prevalent question is that if all of this is well known and public information,

30:55.220 --> 30:57.420
then why does Timu even exist?

30:57.420 --> 31:01.900
Why would any company throw in so much good money after the bad to chase a business model

31:01.900 --> 31:05.740
that past companies have already proven to be largely unsustainable?

31:05.740 --> 31:09.900
Timu is the latest venture from the Chinese e-commerce giant Pingdo-Do.

31:09.900 --> 31:15.300
Pingdo-Do, or PDD for short, was founded in 2015 and is one of the strangest modern day

31:15.300 --> 31:16.300
businesses.

31:16.300 --> 31:21.440
If their numbers are to be trusted, this tiny startup somehow grew from zero to one of China's

31:21.440 --> 31:24.320
biggest online retailers in just three years.

31:24.320 --> 31:29.280
PDD gained popularity in China for its group purchase model where customers can pull in

31:29.280 --> 31:33.280
friends and family into their orders so that they can increase the order quantities and

31:33.280 --> 31:35.760
then collectively unlock greater savings.

31:35.760 --> 31:41.040
PDD's success as a platform in China, if real, is as much a product of culture as it

31:41.040 --> 31:42.560
is of technology.

31:42.560 --> 31:47.780
While shopping is generally a solitary, personal, individualistic, and highly efficient activity

31:47.780 --> 31:52.220
in the West, shopping in China is a more communal and social activity that's built

31:52.220 --> 31:57.420
on the same collectivism and cultural isolationism of modern Chinese society.

31:57.420 --> 32:02.980
The point here is that PDD as a platform in its design can only be successful in China.

32:02.980 --> 32:07.780
As PDD has scaled, the company has followed the same predictable growth playbook of other

32:07.780 --> 32:10.220
established e-commerce companies around the world.

32:10.400 --> 32:14.400
They've used data to improve their product recommendations, to personalize the shopping

32:14.400 --> 32:19.200
experience for users, to build out their own warehouses, to construct their own distribution

32:19.200 --> 32:24.160
centers, to provide logistics to merchants for a fee, to sell its own private label goods

32:24.160 --> 32:28.720
on its marketplace like Amazon Basics, and even rolling out a grocery delivery service

32:28.720 --> 32:29.720
like Instacart.

32:29.720 --> 32:34.240
PDD's main challenge these days is that the company has hit a ceiling in terms of what

32:34.240 --> 32:37.200
it can accomplish by operating in China alone.

32:37.200 --> 32:42.100
The only way to sustain its historic double or triple digit growth is to go overseas,

32:42.100 --> 32:46.620
but the core group purchase platform is simply not translatable to the West.

32:46.620 --> 32:50.620
More than that, it would only be foolish to go head-to-head against Amazon in its home

32:50.620 --> 32:55.060
court competing for the same users, and especially as a foreign brand.

32:57.060 --> 33:01.820
PDD has reaped millions of dollars year over year from the American equity markets, where

33:01.820 --> 33:06.180
the company's rapid rise and impressive, non-regulated financials have painted the

33:06.200 --> 33:11.280
pictures of an unstoppable, fast-growing tech rocket ship in the world's second-largest

33:11.280 --> 33:12.280
economy.

33:12.280 --> 33:17.160
Even though no American can even access PDD, it hasn't stopped retail investors from diving

33:17.160 --> 33:22.840
in head-first and propelling Pindodo's valuation to even higher than that of Alibaba in less

33:22.840 --> 33:24.040
than three years.

33:24.040 --> 33:29.720
PDD's insane growth has fueled its radical valuation on the American equity markets,

33:29.720 --> 33:34.140
which is in turn enable the company to sell shares at spectacular premiums, enriching

33:34.160 --> 33:37.040
both shareholders and insiders alike.

33:37.040 --> 33:41.240
But with their core platform now plateauing in China, the only way to keep up growth is

33:41.240 --> 33:42.240
to enter the U.S.

33:42.240 --> 33:47.200
But with Amazon firmly entrenched in the middle and upper end of the market, PDD's best

33:47.200 --> 33:48.640
bet is at the bottom.

33:48.640 --> 33:53.120
Quote, as we reach our current scale, investors should not expect us to continuously deliver

33:53.120 --> 33:54.120
high growth.

33:54.120 --> 33:58.840
As our user base reaches its current scale, our focus now is on how to serve our existing

33:58.840 --> 34:03.560
880 million Chinese users and how to improve their trust and mind share.

34:03.580 --> 34:07.460
Our team has started out roughly half a year ago, and given the early stage nature, the

34:07.460 --> 34:10.500
financial impact from this business is relatively small.

34:10.500 --> 34:13.820
We are entering new markets, so we need to understand customers.

34:13.820 --> 34:18.420
Our team is laser focused on understanding and accepting different cultural preferences,

34:18.420 --> 34:23.220
social environments, and consumer demand with the aim of creating more unique value.

34:23.220 --> 34:28.300
Timu is young, experimental, and unproven, but that hasn't stopped PDD from promoting

34:28.300 --> 34:31.140
it everywhere it can, even at the Super Bowl.

34:31.160 --> 34:35.960
Like with Aliexpress and Alibaba, Timu only works today because it's subsidized by a

34:35.960 --> 34:37.560
mature core business.

34:37.560 --> 34:42.200
Timu's existence is fundamentally borne out of PDD's urgency to maintain its double

34:42.200 --> 34:45.560
digit growth and to keep up its equity valuations.

34:45.560 --> 34:51.000
In business, cost, quality, and speed are traditionally presented in the form of a triangle

34:51.000 --> 34:55.120
where companies can realistically only achieve two of these things at a time.

34:55.120 --> 34:59.320
No business can achieve all three, yet Timu is burning millions of dollars to challenge

34:59.340 --> 35:04.780
this age-old paradigm by offering customers unprecedented speed, price, and value, promising

35:04.780 --> 35:10.740
generous 90-day refunds, 30-day price adjustments, free shipping, and delivery within two weeks

35:10.740 --> 35:13.380
or less to squash its weakening rivals.

35:15.900 --> 35:19.660
Wish is a tale of not just another Silicon Valley pump and dump, but also a real-world

35:19.660 --> 35:23.800
reminder that the software platform business is a myth and that online businesses are

35:23.800 --> 35:27.620
not any more advantageous than traditional brick-and-mortar ones.

35:27.620 --> 35:31.280
In business, we are all compensated based on the value that we generate.

35:31.280 --> 35:35.720
When you operate as a software-only platform like Wish and like how many other startups

35:35.720 --> 35:38.520
do, you're really only solving the easy problems.

35:38.520 --> 35:43.000
Building a website and facilitating a transaction between two parties is ultimately not that

35:43.000 --> 35:47.880
difficult, especially when the transaction is worth less than a meal at McDonald's.

35:47.880 --> 35:51.880
Selling cheap Chinese junk is actually a proven business in every part of the world, whether

35:51.880 --> 35:56.840
that's the mighty dollar store or the random peddlers that sell cheap souvenirs at tourist

35:57.740 --> 35:58.740
destinations.

35:58.740 --> 36:02.380
But when you try to do the same thing exclusively online, where visitors can leave just as fast

36:02.380 --> 36:06.100
with a click of a button, where customers can't touch and feel what they're buying

36:06.100 --> 36:10.660
and they have no intent or pressure to splurge, the work you have to do to build up that trust

36:10.660 --> 36:13.420
and urgency virtually is monumental.

36:13.420 --> 36:17.900
Only time will tell if Timu will be sustainable or if he'll be another flash in the pan,

36:17.900 --> 36:22.660
but if the results of AliExpress and Wish are anything to go off of, the odds are completely

36:22.660 --> 36:24.060
stacked against Timu.
