0	10480	Screaming on roller coasters, getting splashed on log rides, ramming friends in bumper cars,
10480	15200	and riding on carousels with family are treasured memories for those who grew up in the 2000s
15200	16200	and earlier.
16200	19760	The amusement park just like the shopping mall and movie theater was once a seemingly
19760	23680	indispensable establishment for every major metropolitan.
23680	27600	In the eras before the internet and where availability mattered above all else, the
27600	31440	amusement park thrived as a provider of affordable recreation.
31440	36200	People of all ages could have fun at the park for an entire day which is $20-$30 and within
36200	38960	a 1-2 hour drive from their homes.
38960	44080	Yet fast forward to the present and amusement parks are a dying breed in the modern age.
44080	47960	In the past amusement parks were defined by their rides like how fast a certain roller
47960	51200	coaster traveled or how steep a drop tower was.
51200	55380	Nowadays what matters most for an amusement park is intellectual property.
55380	59060	With the emergence of the Disney adult, consumers around the world have shown a preference
59060	64540	for IP based theme parks like Universal Studios and Disneyland where the branded attractions,
64540	69660	concessions, and merchandise have fueled above average spending and immense popularity.
69660	73500	Consumers have shown an insatiable appetite to immerse themselves in their favorite media
73500	78780	franchises, paying without hesitation for $9 butter beer from Harry Potter, $10 pink
78780	84860	sprinkle donuts from The Simpsons, $12 Mario Strawberry Soda from Nintendo, $15 meat on
84860	90660	the bone from One Piece, $8 Blue Milk from Star Wars, and $7 Cheesecake Orbs from the
90660	92780	Marvel Cinematic Universe.
92780	97040	Beyond rides and concessions, the IPs come to life at these parks where visitors get to
97040	101660	mingle shoulder to shoulder with bubbly costume performers who behave just like their big
101660	103980	screen blockbuster equivalents.
103980	108540	While park goers soak up this magical atmosphere, underneath every costume is a blue collar
108540	113300	worker who's sweating buckets and being paid minimum wage to entertain thousands of strangers
113300	114540	every day.
114540	119300	The themed foods, branded attractions, exclusive merchandise, and trademark characters have
119300	124180	elevated experiences and expectations to the point where conventional amusement parks can
124180	128660	no longer compete with their generic foods, mascots, and rides.
128660	134460	When customers want Space Mountain, The Avengers Campus, The Millennium Falcon, Diagon Alley,
134460	140020	Minions, and Elsa, having the fastest roller coaster is suddenly a lot less relevant.
140020	144520	While the local park will always be more convenient and affordable with admissions and run-of-the-mill
144720	149480	concessions, compared to Disney and Universal, who charge two to five times more for entry
149480	152660	alone, customers ultimately vote with their wallet.
152660	157360	In this day and age, customers have demonstrated through their spend, attendance, and virality
157360	161480	that they'd rather make a special trip to Disney and Universal than go to the basic
161480	163320	regional amusement park.
163320	166720	In this episode, we'll cover the business of roller coasters through the lens of Six
166720	171120	Flags, the largest operator of amusement parks in the world, and the many strategies
171120	175720	that the company has employed to survive, differentiate itself, and to capture whatever
175720	178840	share that remains in this ultra-competitive market.
181200	185640	For older generations, the amusement park was a unique place of happiness and entertainment
185640	187840	in a time where mental health was taboo.
187840	192520	And this episode is sponsored by BetterHelp, the leader in affordable, accessible online
192520	193520	therapy.
193520	198600	In my early 20s, I grinded after graduation, like many of my peers, working long hours,
198600	203000	appeasing my bosses, coming in on weekends, and ignoring personal obligations just so
203000	206040	I could be the highest performer in corporate America.
206040	211000	I worked like this for years, always stressed, irritable, impatient, and cranky, but when
211000	215040	my products were randomly killed off and my engineering teams were fired, did I realize
215040	216040	I needed help?
216040	220400	I wanted to become a better person and to still work hard, but no longer at the expense
220400	223280	of family, friends, and my own mental health.
223280	224840	I went to therapy.
224840	228720	Being a non-judgmental professional and a safe environment was cathartic and healing
228720	229720	for me.
229720	233960	Just talking about my problems and recognizing them out loud was profound.
233960	237920	Therapy is beneficial for everyone, even 20-year-old dudes like me, and BetterHelp's
237920	241240	mission is to make therapy more affordable and accessible.
241240	245480	BetterHelp is a platform that makes finding a therapist easier as it's fully online
245480	246720	and remote.
246720	250920	By just filling out a few questions, BetterHelp can match you to a professional therapist
250920	254760	in as little as a few days, and if you don't click with your matched therapist, you can
254760	259320	easily switch to a new one at no additional cost without stressing about insurance and
259320	260480	networks.
260480	263680	If you're stressed or struggling, consider BetterHelp.
263680	267680	Therapy was invaluable for me and my times of need, and when you visit betterhelp.com
267680	272280	slash MBA, you can get 10% off your first month of therapy.
272280	276800	Mental health is just as important as physical health, and online therapy is one of the cheapest,
276800	279920	easiest, and most effective ways to take care of yourself.
279920	284120	Like going to the gym or having a good diet, it doesn't hurt to try therapy.
284120	290960	Thank you to BetterHelp for supporting Modern MBA and making this episode possible.
290960	295520	To understand the business of amusement parks, we can draw from Roller Coaster Tycoon.
295520	299480	For people who aren't familiar, Roller Coaster Tycoon is a popular simulation game where
299480	302120	you can build and manage your own amusement park.
302120	306960	You choose which rides go where, what types of rides to offer, where to place footpaths
306960	311760	to direct visitors from one attraction to the next, where to place the bathrooms, where
311760	315960	to put concession stands to optimize food and drink sales, and how much staff to hire
315960	318080	to keep the park running smoothly.
318080	324080	All while maximizing profits, guest satisfaction, park appeal, property value, and ROI from
324080	326080	the limited budget available.
326080	330360	Just like in real life, there are consequences to poor planning and bad investments.
330360	335040	If there aren't enough security guards, the park will become chaotic and suffer vandalism.
335040	338360	Guests will complain about hygiene if there aren't enough bathrooms or janitors.
338680	343040	If there are too many visitors, then guest happiness will decrease with the overcrowding.
343040	345940	If a ride is too intense, then guests will get sick.
345940	348880	If a ride is too fast, the chance of accidents increase.
348880	352280	If there aren't enough handymen to perform maintenance, then the roller coasters will
352280	353280	break down.
353280	356480	If the prices are too high, then customers won't spend.
356480	360680	And if the rides aren't regularly renovated, then visitors will get bored and park appeal
360680	362400	will decrease.
362400	366320	While Roller Coaster Tycoon nails that planning and maintenance are integral to the success
366320	370600	of any amusement park, there are a variety of other factors outside of this video game
370600	374960	depiction that make the overall business so uniquely difficult.
374960	378480	The core business model of the amusement park is fairly straightforward.
378480	382200	You pull in as many customers as you can, and you entertain them so they stay as long
382200	385160	as possible and spend as much as possible.
385160	389280	Once customers are inside the park, you can monetize them aggressively with high markups
389280	393680	on food and merchandise to squeeze more dollars from entry tickets.
393680	398800	At cruise ships, amusement parks are capital intensive businesses where continuous monetization
398800	405160	by volume and margin are necessary to offset the huge operating costs and massive overhead.
405160	409400	As we covered in the episode on cruises, a single cruise ship costs over half a billion
409400	410480	dollars.
410480	414360	And amusement parks are no different in that the construction of a single park falls in
414360	419360	the same ballpark with costs of 400 to 800 million dollars, whereas the top of the line
419360	423560	Disney or Universal theme park ranges in the billions.
423560	427720	Despite comparable capital requirements to cruises, the barriers to entry are actually
427720	429940	much higher for amusement parks.
429940	434560	The bottleneck for amusement parks is not really just the labor, engineering or material,
434560	436440	but rather in the land.
436440	440240	Parks conventionally build appeal by having one or two centerpiece roller coasters that
440240	443880	goes super fast, super high, and have maximum airtime.
443880	448160	Even if the average visitor is too scared to ride them, these thrill rides are by design
448160	453040	defining attractions that are super tall, super long, and super wide, so parks generally
453040	458480	build other attractions around them to generate atmosphere, attention, and curb appeal.
458480	463600	But to go fast and high, these roller coasters need lots of space, mile long tracks, and
463600	466560	can eat up 5 to 10 acres by themselves.
466560	471080	On the flip side, smaller rides like kiddie coasters are significantly more space efficient
471080	476120	with footprints of half an acre or less, but they're also a lot less memorable to visitors.
476120	479800	If a park has too many thrill rides, then the family business will be hard to attract
479800	484200	and capture, whereas a park with too many kiddie coasters and not enough thrill rides
484200	488880	will lose the teenager and adult market.
488880	492960	While there have been innovations in recent years with space efficient vertical oriented
492960	497640	roller coasters that don't require lift hills, trade-offs still remain.
497640	502120	These vertical rides have lower capacity, which means slower loads and longer wait time for
502120	503120	guests.
503120	507040	Another alternative are indoor rides, like the Harry Potter or Transformers experiences
507040	512040	at Universal, where robotic arms on a track rotate, tilt, and twist seats in movements
512040	516800	that are synchronized with VFX that's projected on screen in front of riders.
516800	521600	These rides are space efficient and even feature animatronics that blow water, heat, or air,
521600	527000	but are also delicate and costly systems that require top end hardware, custom VFX, and
527000	529020	years of intricate planning.
529020	532480	With all roller coasters, there's a question of build versus buy.
532480	536640	You can engineer your own from the ground up for maximum originality points, or you
536640	542040	can settle for ready-made rides from manufacturers with preset specifications.
542040	545720	If you want to make lots of money, you need as many rides and attractions as possible
545720	550480	to maximize appeal and satisfaction, which requires both capital and land, with the latter
550480	552520	being much harder to acquire.
552520	557120	The average amusement park has a footprint between 100 to 500 acres.
557120	560760	There is no hard rule in the industry that a successful amusement park must be over
560760	561760	100 acres.
561760	566240	There are plenty of small independent parks that are still live to this day on compact
566240	570680	plots of land, like the two-acre Adventure City in Southern California.
570680	574480	While these small parks adjust for their lesser offerings with cheaper tickets, they also
574480	579240	rarely attract huge crowds or high spenders as consumers can experience everything they
579240	582460	have to offer in half a day or less.
582460	586760	The fundamental difference between grossing thousands and millions as an amusement park
586760	589320	comes down to size and land.
589320	594160	In this age where demand for housing is boiling over around the world, inventory of vacant
594160	598960	commercial lots of 100 to 500 acres is largely non-existent.
598960	602560	While there are always thousands of acres of undeveloped land that's for sale throughout
602560	607720	the Midwest, the South, and other remote regions in the United States, these lots are generally
607720	613480	not zoned for commercial recreation or they're simply too far from any major urban market.
613480	617640	Any land in a metropolitan area these days that's still available, which could support
617640	622720	an amusement park, is just too expensive or worth far more being developed for residential
622720	624480	or commercial use.
624480	629640	Municipalities can also be an obstacle as any high-profile, land-intensive, privatized
629640	634680	recreational infrastructure like the taxpayer-funded sports stadiums of the past decade would be
634680	640240	subject to intense public and political scrutiny.
640240	644840	As an outdoors establishment, amusement parks are seasonal businesses where attendance,
644840	648160	engagement, and earnings are dependent on the weather.
648160	652320	Parks really only make money two quarters out of the year as a vast majority of business
652320	655280	occurs between the months of May and September.
655280	659720	What people often overlook is that the average amusement park is actually a regional business
659720	661400	that serves locals.
661400	666440	Disney and Universal are exceptions where their customer base are mostly international tourists
666440	669720	and out-of-towners making pre-planned pilgrimages.
669720	674280	As a result, location is even more important for conventional, non-IP-based amusement
674280	679840	parks as they need to be within a 50 to 100 mile radius of a major metropolitan area where
679840	684840	locals can get into their cars, arrive before noon, and make it back home before midnight
684840	686400	all in one day.
686400	690680	Parks scale staffing by attendance and regularly bring on hundreds or thousands of minimum
690680	694440	wage unskilled short-term workers to operate in the high season.
694440	698560	In short, there needs to be a market with enough consumers and workers close by for
698560	700960	an amusement park to be successful.
700960	705920	Even if you get all the land, capital, planning, and rides in place, the only way to grow is
705920	707280	to keep spending.
707280	710920	Since the customer base is mostly going to be locals, they'll inevitably get bored
710920	712680	after a few visits.
712680	717760	On top of non-stop ride maintenance to ensure gas safety, renovation is essential to maintaining
717760	720320	engagement and driving retention.
720320	724240	If you have the land, you can always expand by adding more to the park, but more likely
724240	729680	than not, your option is to remodel the existing rides into newer experiences.
729680	733760	While renovations are never as expensive as the initial construction, remodeling is still
733760	738240	significant capital expenditure that costs millions of dollars every year.
738240	742200	To demonstrate just how real the barriers to entry are in this industry, in the past
742200	746600	40 plus years, there's not been a single new regional amusement park in the United
746600	747720	States.
747720	751960	Every major market in the country is already served by an entrenched player, and burning
751960	756880	over half a billion dollars to chase second place is a high-risk, low-reward strategy
756880	759400	that very few investors are interested in.
759400	764080	The last entrant was the Hard Rock Park in South Carolina that lasted just one year before
764080	766320	going under in 2009.
766320	770240	Hard Rock Park is just one of hundreds of other failed amusement parks in the world,
770240	775320	and now nearly 15 years after its closure, only one company, FedEx, has been able to
775320	778320	find some use from that abandoned land.
778320	782000	Given how much it takes to make a single park successful, there's no established third
782000	786520	party arrangement in the industry like franchising, where someone else will run the park for you
786640	790880	and give you a royalty when they're already faced with so much overhead and day-to-day
790880	792080	complexity.
792080	795880	All these factors have made it so that legacy parks like Six Flags have been able to stay
795880	800720	alive simply by virtue of having built their parks in the 70s or earlier.
800720	805040	Six Flags portfolio consists of both amusement parks and water parks.
805040	809880	While the number of parks under company ownership has gradually decreased over the past 20 years,
809880	816280	Six Flags remains the largest regional amusement park operator in the world.
816280	821120	On the West Coast, Six Flags Discovery Kingdom serves the San Francisco Bay Area and Northern
821120	825960	California while Six Flags Magic Mountain caters to Los Angeles and the greater Southern
825960	827040	California.
827040	832080	On the East Coast, Six Flags New England serves Providence, Boston, and New Haven.
832080	836680	Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey also caters to New York City and Philadelphia,
836680	839840	and Six Flags in Maryland hits DC and Baltimore.
839840	844720	In the Midwest, Six Flags Great America and Hurricane Harbor fill demand in from Chicago
844720	845920	and Milwaukee.
845920	850520	And in the South, Six Flags over Georgia is just a 20-minute drive from Atlanta, Six Flags
850520	856120	over Texas, Targets Dallas, and Six Flags Fiesta Texas cover San Antonio, Houston,
856120	857120	and Austin.
857120	861120	The coverage and entrenchment of Six Flags in these leading consumer markets make the
861120	864440	company an established, immovable legacy player.
864440	868000	What's interesting is that Six Flags has only built three of these parks themselves
868000	871000	with the remainder being rebranded acquisitions.
871000	875900	In this industry, first mover advantage is a true lasting moat, and the number and distribution
875900	880980	of parks across the United States, Mexico, and Canada enable Six Flags not just to make
880980	884820	more money, but also to safeguard against the weather and the economy.
884820	889180	If there's a local downturn or severe rain in one region, the other unaffected parks
889180	891100	can pick up the slack.
891100	896600	Since the 70s, Six Flags has had one main strategy, to have the most legendary, spectacular,
896600	898940	and thrilling roller coasters in the world.
898940	903260	Since the company can't compete on intellectual property, the focus has been on maximizing
903260	904620	spectacle.
904620	908420	Real Capital is the official tagline given to every Six Flags park, and the company
908420	911600	regularly pushes the boundaries of what's possible.
911600	916060	Every year, Six Flags introduces groundbreaking rides, with endless examples through its history
916060	921540	like New Revolution, which was the world's tallest roller coaster at opening in 1976,
921540	925420	Superman, which was the world's tallest and first ever roller coaster to reach speeds
925420	930860	of 100 miles per hour in 1997, X2 was the first ever fourth dimension roller coaster
930860	936660	upon opening in 2002, King Dekas in 2005 remains the fastest ride in the continent and the
936660	941460	tallest in the world, Zumanjara is the world's tallest drop tower, while the Goliath is the
941460	946460	fastest wooden roller coaster, both of which opened to the public in 2014, and the Jersey
946460	952300	Devil in 2020 broke records as the tallest and fastest single rail coaster in the world.
952300	956120	Quote, we believe that you should have news in every park every year.
956120	959620	This is different from what traditional theme parks do, where they'll put in a big coaster
959620	963260	in a few of their parks, and then they'll go dark for a year or two while they put coasters
963260	965080	in some of their other parks.
965080	969320	We want to have a new ride or attraction in every park every year.
969320	973320	Even though there are fewer Six Flags parks today than there were 20 years ago, this continuous
973320	978460	differentiation on spectacle and the company's unmatched scale have kept Six Flags up as
978460	981460	a cheaper alternative to Disney and Universal.
981460	985100	Yet the construction and design costs of these rides are not trivial, and the payback
985100	991180	periods are lengthy, as Six Flags invests over $100 million every year in capital expenditures.
991180	997260	$100 million annually is roughly 9 to 10% of Six Flags gross revenue, but 30 to 50%
997260	1001480	of operating income, which is ultimately what matters since that's the cash you actually
1001480	1006580	get after day to day expenses.
1006580	1011340	Beyond having relatively more extreme thrill rides, Six Flags has tried to adapt to changing
1011340	1015480	consumer tastes by bringing in intellectual property of its own.
1015480	1019700	In an attempt to level the playing field with Disney and Universal, Six Flags has branded
1019700	1024980	its rides and parks over the decades with iconic fictional characters like Bugs Bunny,
1024980	1031300	Batman, Tweety Bird, Superman, and the Flintstones, a healthy mix of idolized superheroes and
1031300	1035980	family-friendly animations for appeal to both teenagers and families.
1035980	1039620	Like everything in the industry that we've seen so far, the cost for just renting these
1039620	1041940	IPs come at a premium.
1041940	1047260	Every year, Six Flags pays $3 to $8 million up front as a flat fee to Warner Bros, along
1047260	1053380	with a 12 to 15% royalty on all branded merchandise in exchange for exclusive rides to license
1053380	1055940	these characters at their amusement parks.
1055940	1059820	But just like their box office performance, DC characters just don't have the same
1059820	1068140	pull as Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, Nintendo, Harry Potter, Jurassic Park, or even One Piece.
1068140	1072620	While Six Flags has not grown at the same rate as Disney or Universal, company revenue
1072620	1075620	has been on a positive trajectory since 2002.
1075620	1080180	For the past 20 years, admissions has represented the majority of Six Flags annual revenue,
1080180	1084460	followed by food and merchandise sales inside the park, and then finally sponsorships and
1084460	1085900	licensing.
1085900	1091300	Revenue has been on a steady climb at 4% growth year over year for Six Flags, going from $880
1091300	1097220	million in 2003 to $1.5 billion in 2019 before the pandemic.
1097220	1100980	The numbers get interesting when we present them on a per-park basis.
1100980	1106140	In the early 2000s, the average Six Flags grows between $20 to $30 million every year.
1106140	1111700	In the 2010s before the pandemic, the average Six Flags park grows between $50 to $60 million
1111700	1113020	every year.
1113020	1117700	Roughly $30 million come from ticket admissions, while in-park food and merchandise sales make
1117700	1119740	up the other $20 million.
1119740	1125700	The average guest at Six Flags in the past decade spent roughly $40, with $25 going towards
1125700	1129540	entry and $17 on in-park purchases.
1129540	1134100	But before we go too far, it's important to contextualize the sleep in per-park earning
1134100	1135340	productivity.
1135340	1139900	While Six Flags has unmatched scale today, the company was operating at an even greater
1139900	1143620	scale 20 years ago, albeit unsustainably.
1143620	1149380	Starting in the 1990s, Six Flags took out over $2 billion of loans to chase first mover
1149380	1155060	advantage in any market possible, borrowing money to buy parks across the United States,
1155180	1158660	Germany, Holland, Belgium, and France.
1158660	1162340	Most of these acquired parks were not performing, hence why they had been put up first sale
1162340	1163820	in the first place.
1163820	1168980	Despite selling at multi-million dollar premiums, each park required millions more in post-sales
1168980	1173740	investment to reach their full potential, but Six Flags believed it uniquely possessed
1173740	1178140	both the capital and the expertise to quickly turn these assets around.
1178140	1182260	But many of these acquisitions were inherently constrained by being in markets that were either
1182260	1184700	too soft or already contested.
1184700	1189340	The contrast between Disneyland Paris and Disneyland Orlando to this day is a clear
1189340	1193980	reminder to the industry that there are insurmountable cultural differences.
1193980	1199460	The lifestyle-oriented and economical European just doesn't have the same appetite, demand,
1199460	1204420	and standard for amusement parks that overworked capitalist Americans do.
1206940	1211620	As Six Flags borrowed more money, bought more parks, took on more overhead, and invested
1211620	1216260	more every year to make each asset successful, the company was in reality digging itself
1216260	1218140	into a deep hole.
1218140	1223740	Debt skyrocketed to $2.3 billion and remained there for years, which was two to three times
1223740	1227900	the total revenue that Six Flags was bringing in every year.
1227900	1232060	Through the 2000s, Six Flags posted loss after loss and there were little signs that their
1232060	1233940	strategy was working.
1233940	1238500	While overall revenue increased with the addition of each additional park, costs also increased
1238500	1241420	in line at a near one-to-one ratio.
1241420	1245740	Six Flags did not generate enough cash from operating at times to even cover the annual
1245740	1248620	interest that was due on its massive debts.
1248620	1252420	Even in the years where Six Flags didn't buy parks, the company was still not grossing
1252420	1258060	enough to afford all the renovation and improvements that were occurring in its existing assets.
1258060	1262540	In a classic story of robbing Peter to pay Paul, Six Flags borrowed money from one place
1262540	1267460	to pay off debts from another, issuing millions of preferred stock to raise funds, selling
1267460	1272380	hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bonds, refinancing existing credit lines and
1272380	1276580	using all these proceeds to repay debt and to maintain liquidity.
1276580	1281060	The company even went so far as to use some of the debt to pay out dividends to investors
1281060	1282700	despite being in the red.
1282700	1287260	And when Six Flags could no longer continue this financial equivalent of Russian roulette,
1287260	1292340	the company begrudgingly sold off its European division and abandoned underperforming locations,
1292340	1297620	going from nearly 40 parks in 2003 to just 20 parks by 2007.
1297620	1302180	Overall revenue improved with the streamlining as did earnings productivity as only the best
1302180	1303540	parks remained.
1303540	1309100	The average Six Flags park grossed around $40-50 million in the mid-2000s, nearly double
1309100	1311740	compared to that of the early 2000s.
1311740	1315820	But the company continued to kick debt down the road, the losses continued, and when the
1315820	1321300	Great Recession hit in 2008, it was the straw that finally broke the camel's back.
1321300	1325500	Recession parks have long sold themselves as recession-proof defensive businesses.
1325500	1330820	While airlines, cruises, hotels, resorts, and other traditional travel businesses will
1330820	1335400	lose customers in recession, the parks industry has pushed the argument that people still
1335400	1340020	need somewhere to escape to despite cutting back on vacations, and amusement parks are
1340020	1343900	unmatched in the value and the entertainment that they provide.
1343900	1348420	Despite the industry's positioning, fewer guests came to the park during the Great Recession,
1348420	1351440	and the ones that did show up spent less than before.
1351440	1356000	This drop in attendance and by extension revenue brought Six Flags to the point of bankruptcy
1356000	1359340	in 2009, but its parks remained open.
1359340	1364460	After a high-profile restructuring, Six Flags emerged from bankruptcy in 2010 as lenders
1364460	1368500	forgave over a billion dollars of debt in exchange for full ownership.
1368500	1372860	The new owners who were traumatized from this near-death experience aggressively overhauled
1372860	1377400	Six Flags' business model and pricing strategy into what it believed would be a safer and
1377400	1379200	more reliable variant.
1379200	1382960	This decision would bring success, but it would also dig the company into a different
1382960	1390920	hole over the next decade, and one that Six Flags is still trying to crawl out of today.
1390920	1395800	Six Flags went into the 2010s with the laser focus on selling memberships and season passes
1395800	1399040	over traditional full-priced gate tickets.
1399040	1403120	Memberships on paper were sticky, recurring revenue in which customers would pay an annual
1403120	1407040	fee to get unlimited entry and perks every year.
1407040	1411560	This annual fee was typically spread out into a flexible payment plan, so customers only
1411560	1416000	needed to pay out a few dollars every month to maintain their membership.
1416000	1420840	Season passes on the other hand also offered unlimited entry and a few perks, but expired
1420840	1424600	at the end of every season for a cheaper one-time fee.
1424600	1429000	These products were advantageous for the company in that Six Flags got to collect payment upfront
1429000	1432360	at the time of purchase rather than at the time of visit.
1432360	1436120	Even if customers didn't go to the park, Six Flags would have still made money.
1436120	1440600	From a psychology standpoint, it also reversed roles in that Six Flags no longer had to convince
1440600	1445960	customers to come as pass holders and members would naturally feel compelled to visit regularly
1445960	1448160	to get the most out of their purchase.
1448160	1453880	In 2010, a one-day entry ticket to Six Flags at the gate cost $30 to $40 and parking would
1453880	1455840	set you back another $10 to $20.
1455840	1459240	A season pass that year was priced at just $70.
1459240	1464400	In 2014, a one-day ticket cost $65, but it was a much better deal to buy the season pass
1464480	1470400	for $80 or to subscribe to a membership for $100 as those products included free parking.
1470400	1474240	As long as a season pass holder visited the park at least twice a year, they were saving
1474240	1476240	$50 per person.
1476240	1478440	In theory, everyone was a winner.
1478440	1482720	The value-oriented consumer felt like they got the best deal, fans felt like they were
1482720	1488440	being rewarded for their loyalty, and Six Flags got to collect and recognize revenue upfront
1488440	1491880	in a steady, reoccurring, predictable manner.
1491880	1496760	While Six Flags product strategy was to build as many groundbreaking thrill rides as possible,
1496760	1499400	their pricing strategy was all about value.
1499400	1503800	The assumption behind the season passes and memberships is that the lost revenue from discounted
1503800	1508160	admissions would be easily made up through in-park food and merchandise sales.
1508160	1512280	In the mind of Six Flags executives, the most important thing was volume.
1512280	1516640	With such high overhead and fixed costs, they believed it was better to fill each park with
1516640	1521840	as many bodies as possible versus gatekeeping over a few bucks in admissions.
1521840	1525640	As long as people were buying something in the park when they visited, those high-margin
1525640	1529280	sales would be enough to offset the ticket subsidies.
1529280	1533760	The problem is that Six Flags went overboard, aggressively discounting season passes and
1533760	1538040	memberships to substantially cheaper price points than one-day tickets while giving away
1538040	1544200	too much for free with free parking, skip-the-line privileges, and complimentary dining.
1544200	1548320	With this new focus on value, annual guest attendance for Six Flags grew at a steady
1548320	1554320	pace from 24 million visitors in 2011 to 30 million by 2016.
1554320	1558920	If we break out Six Flags revenue into its two main income streams, revenue from park
1558920	1565800	admissions grew the most at 45% in a nine-year period, going from $452 million in 2010 to
1565800	1569160	$815 million in 2019.
1569160	1575200	Food and merchandise sales grew slower at 40% in the same time frame from $348 million
1575280	1581120	to $574 million, which was solid, but not what Six Flags had been hoping for.
1581120	1585260	The company had been making every effort to keep ticket prices as flat as possible since
1585260	1586760	the Great Recession.
1586760	1591440	In nine years, the average price of a Six Flags ticket increased in line with inflation
1591440	1592440	at 17%.
1592440	1597960	In 2010, the average ticket to Six Flags cost $21.26.
1597960	1604960	In 2019, the average ticket to Six Flags cost just $24.86, which was just $3.60 million
1605200	1607880	more than what it cost nine years ago.
1607880	1612520	On an annual basis, we can see how sensitive the company was towards raising ticket prices
1612520	1615440	and how attached they were to discounting admissions.
1615440	1620080	In any year where the average ticket price increased, like in 2014, the company would
1620080	1626040	immediately push the cost back down in the following years.
1626040	1629880	Subsidizing tickets would not be a big deal if that spend was being recaptured in the
1629880	1635160	park, but the average spend on food and merchandise per guest had gone up just $1.00 and $12.00
1635160	1637280	cents in nine years.
1637280	1642760	Guests on average were spending just $17 to $18 per visit, and it was no secret why.
1642760	1647240	People were leaving Six Flags, going to their cars, driving to the closest fast food chain
1647240	1652000	to eat, and then returning to the park, or they were already coming to the park full.
1652000	1656800	Few people wanted to get ripped off with 10 to $15 plates of frozen chicken strips, fries
1656800	1657800	and pizza.
1657800	1662560	The budget-conscious value-oriented consumers that Six Flags targeted were especially conscious
1662560	1664720	not to fall into such traps.
1664720	1669320	While Six Flags showered its pass holders and members with massive discounts and perks,
1669320	1673600	in reality the company was never going to change the nature of bargain hunters.
1673600	1678280	Rather than improving the in-park concessions, Six Flags opted to simply slap dining onto
1678280	1683200	the season pass and memberships as a way to upsell and to collect more revenue up front.
1683200	1688200	For a higher fee, season pass holders could get two free meals, snacks, and drinks every
1688200	1689680	time they visited.
1689680	1693480	Headlines were made when a California man revealed that he ate lunch and dinner at his
1693480	1699680	local Six Flags every day for seven years using just his annual $150 season pass.
1699680	1704320	This man would drive to Six Flags, drop in for lunch, while this story and individual
1704320	1709020	is clearly an extreme, it's still an entertaining representation of the excessive discounting
1709020	1714640	and generosity that Six Flags engaged in during the 2010s just to fill the parks.
1714640	1718920	There was still enough up front and recurring revenue flowing in from memberships and passes
1718920	1721760	to keep the company on its positive trajectory.
1721760	1726400	Through the 2010s, Six Flags revenue grew at a positive pace while the bottom line returned
1726400	1729680	in the black compared to the red of the prior decade.
1729680	1735240	Roughly 1.5 million people visited Six Flags every year in the 2010s compared to the sub-million
1735240	1736960	of the 2000s.
1736960	1742000	Earning productivity peaked in 2016 as the average Six Flags park grossed over $70 million
1742000	1748640	a year with roughly $37 million attributed to admissions and the remainder to concessions.
1748640	1752560	During margin returned to positive digits, which was another welcome improvement compared
1752560	1755440	to the negative streak of the prior decade.
1755440	1760720	At this point, season pass and membership holders accounted for 50 to 60% of Six Flags
1760720	1763200	annual attendance every year.
1763200	1767480	The pass model was working as desired and the only thing left to do was to slam on the
1767480	1769280	gas pedal even harder.
1769280	1775440	In 2016, Six Flags began buying up water parks within a 150 mile radius to their existing
1775440	1779840	amusement parks with the only goal of selling higher priced combo passes.
1779840	1783560	The company envisioned that existing season pass holders who were in search of getting
1783560	1789280	the best deal possible would happily pay an extra $20-40 up front to get unlimited access
1789280	1792960	to a nearby water park even if they were unlikely to visit it.
1792960	1797520	In an all too familiar pattern, Six Flags once again began borrowing large sums of money
1797520	1803120	to finance these acquisitions and long term debt crossed the $2 billion mark once more.
1803120	1807880	While the water park roll-up strategy helped ensure top line growth, company profits largely
1807880	1815200	stagnated under this two park strategy as in-park spend remained flat.
1815200	1820200	To alleviate investor concerns, Six Flags leadership spun a growth story to Wall Street
1820200	1825600	that international licensing was this fast emerging, high margin, service based, asset
1825600	1829360	light revenue stream that could quickly help pay down this growing debt.
1830120	1833760	We did a study a couple years ago that looked at our brand awareness outside the United
1833760	1834760	States.
1834760	1840680	Six Flags brand recognition was very, very high, even higher than Universal and Disneyland.
1840680	1845000	People look at us and say that we at Six Flags have the success and expertise to open up
1845000	1846560	amusement parks.
1846560	1850120	We don't invest any of our own money into these deals, we're basically working with
1850120	1854280	partners who have access to land and funds to build parks.
1854280	1858520	We're paid for design and development, we get a set fee and once the park is opened
1858520	1863440	up, we get an ongoing revenue stream and management services and royalties generated
1863440	1864440	from the park.
1864440	1867000	There's no capital investment for us.
1867000	1869400	We start making money on day one.
1869400	1874680	The company proudly announced it had secured deals with partners in Dubai, Vietnam, Saudi
1874680	1879600	Arabia and China who had deep pockets and ambitions of their own to build tons of Six
1879600	1881640	Flags parks in their countries.
1881640	1885400	When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.
1885400	1889440	Like most private cross-border ventures, every single one of these partners turned out to
1889440	1893400	be either extremely naive or pure snake oil salesman.
1893400	1898640	The Vietnamese partner Navi Entertainment, an offshoot of a supposed plastic glove factory
1898640	1901680	vanished overnight just months after the announcement.
1901680	1905200	The Dubai partner pulled the plug on the Six Flags deal as they found out that they were
1905200	1909800	already losing too much money on their existing resorts and the Chinese partner defaulted as
1909800	1911480	soon as payments were due.
1911480	1916440	And while every other amusement park operator like Cedar Park, Disney and Universal have
1916440	1921920	all rebounded from COVID, Six Flags remains laggard as attendance and revenue have remained
1921920	1924200	below pre-pandemic levels.
1924200	1929040	The pandemic, for better or worse, accelerated the once reliable, value-oriented season
1929040	1933240	pass holders to critically rethink their spend with Six Flags.
1933240	1938160	Under the pressures of declining attendance, $2 billion in debt and a non-existent growth
1938680	1942320	Six Flags candid's longtime CEO in 2022.
1942320	1946360	His successor didn't mince any words, pointing the finger at the company's long-time discount
1946360	1950360	strategy as the primary culprit for Six Flags' present-day struggles.
1950360	1954880	Quote, literally, we have discounted too much, and the philosophy of filling parks was not
1954880	1956280	the right strategy.
1956280	1960120	At the end of it all, people did not have a good experience, it was not an experience
1960120	1961960	that people were willing to pay for.
1961960	1966200	We only got the discounter, and Six Flags became a cheap daycare center for teenagers
1966280	1968120	during breaks and summers.
1968120	1972360	We've eliminated many of our historical discounts, including free or ultra-low price
1972360	1976640	tickets, and are settling on an approach that balances attendance and revenue.
1976640	1980960	We have reset our strategy and operational priorities, and at a high level, we're focused
1980960	1985400	on providing a premium guest experience and will charge prices that are in line with the
1985400	1987560	value we deliver to our guests.
1987560	1992560	We believe we have pricing power, but only if we deliver an exceptional guest experience.
1992560	1998200	The average revenue per guest, both in in-park spend and admissions, skyrocketed in 2023
1998200	2002320	as going to Six Flags became a lot more expensive under the new CEO.
2002320	2006920	The reality was that while Six Flags focused on spectacle to win headlines and grab attention
2006920	2011040	and season past sales to keep the numbers up, the company completely neglected the core
2011040	2012840	guest experience.
2012840	2017440	Parks had become overcrowded with too many value-oriented pass holders who weren't spending, parking
2017440	2021800	lots were congested as too many people had free parking, restaurants inside the park were
2021800	2026200	taking up to an hour to serve their orders, concession quality had plummeted since food
2026200	2031080	had mostly been given away for free to drive season past sales, and restrooms were always
2031080	2034480	dirty since the park was always at maximum capacity.
2034480	2037920	Everything that wasn't a shiny new roller coaster was just old.
2037920	2042640	For instance, Six Flags is just now putting in digital screens that will display the real-time
2042640	2047520	waits for rides and restaurants, which is technology that Universal and Disneyland have
2047520	2051560	had for years.
2051560	2054880	There are several lessons from Six Flags worth reinforcing.
2054880	2059280	One is that it's a mistake to interpret every dollar and every customer as a win without
2059280	2062880	considering the quality of the dollar and the quality of the customer.
2062880	2067800	The former CEO ignored years of internal data that showed that guests who came in on discounted
2067800	2072640	tickets simply did not spend as much time and money as those that paid full price yet
2072640	2075000	took up the same park capacity.
2075000	2078880	This learning is applicable even in the world of media, where outsiders and brands tend
2078880	2081360	to equate every view as the same.
2081360	2086320	When the lens of either a creator or an advertiser is getting millions of views really a win
2086320	2091160	if most of those views are actually from teenagers who treat the content as a commodity for them
2091160	2092360	to kill time with.
2092360	2096000	In the case of content, the quality of the viewer should matter more than the overall
2096000	2097840	view count.
2097840	2101280	Traditional business thinking teaches that losing a customer is a huge negative that
2101280	2103400	should be avoided at all costs.
2103400	2106880	But in practice, churn in itself can be healthy.
2106880	2110920	Businesses will get better by accepting customer attrition rather than bending over backwards
2110960	2113560	to get customers to stay.
2113560	2117840	Discounting to keep customers paying or to get first timers in the door is an easy way
2117840	2123000	out that brings in short term success at the expense of long term sustainability.
2123000	2128040	With discounting, brands get diluted, the core high value users get neglected and all
2128040	2132240	the attention goes towards appeasing fickle, low value customers.
2132240	2137320	Yet discounting remains today a rampant practice across consumer and enterprise sectors as
2137320	2142320	companies continue to throw everything these days, bundles, perks and discounts just to
2142320	2146520	unlock the next subscriber or to secure that upcoming renewal.
2146520	2149960	In the case of Six Flags, the quality of the customer should have mattered more than the
2149960	2152280	number of customers at the park.
2152280	2157640	And despite 60 years of operating history, Six Flags is just now trying to quantify for
2157640	2162160	the first time what the real value of its parks are to the modern consumer, all while
2162160	2166880	Disney and Universal continue to raise the bar higher and higher every year.
2166880	2171840	The second lesson here is that the cost to generate any $1 of revenue is just as critical
2171840	2175200	as the conventional measures of margins and profits.
2175200	2179360	When we look at Six Flags' top line and bottom line, it looks respectable with healthy double
2179360	2182560	digit margins and billion dollar revenue.
2182560	2187160	Given the wary reception by the public markets, Six Flags has no choice but to lean on debt
2187160	2189560	over equity to maintain liquidity.
2189560	2194000	And the worst part is that every capital improvement in the amusement park industry, whether in
2194000	2199240	the form of ride renovations or food overhaul, will naturally be an expensive endeavor.
2199240	2204520	In the case of Six Flags, debt is not a lifeline or contingency or growth accelerant like it
2204520	2206400	is for traditional businesses.
2206400	2211560	Instead, debt is like an IV bag where the steady drip of funds keeps the company alive
2211560	2214800	even in non-recession, fair weather climates.
2214800	2219280	There is no lean methodology that can be applied to this naturally bloated and capital intensive
2219400	2220400	business.
2220400	2224640	And lenders will continue to let Six Flags borrow as the company's assets, notably
2224640	2227640	its land, still carry high book value.
2227640	2230960	From the outside, Six Flags has a seemingly powerful moat.
2230960	2234640	As no one can get into this industry, and if they do, they'll never be able to reach
2234640	2236800	their scale in 100 years.
2236800	2240800	But at the same time, the reality might also be that no one wants to.
2240800	2244720	These days, a startup will happily boast that they've reached $5 million or $10 million
2245120	2250200	in ARR, but if they also need to spend two to five times that amount to reach that milestone,
2250200	2254080	their business is likely not as robust or as momentous as they're making it out to
2254080	2255080	be.
2255080	2259400	And the only difference here is that the startup uses equity as their runway and has no collateral
2259400	2261040	to use debt.
2261040	2265240	The third lesson is that despite what Wall Street says, reoccurring revenue does not
2265240	2269080	inherently make for a better or stronger business.
2269080	2273440	Subscription revenue makes a financially safer business as churn is more gradual, revenue
2273520	2277720	is more predictable, and forecasts can be more sound, which are all things that only
2277720	2279640	investors care about.
2279640	2283760	If your product or service isn't good enough, people will still churn regardless of whether
2283760	2288640	or not they're paying $10 a month or $100 upfront every year.
2288640	2291640	The final lesson is that headlines never last.
2291640	2296400	Six Flags put millions of dollars every year towards building the fastest, tallest, scariest
2296400	2301080	rides for decades and spent millions more on making sure everyone knew about it.
2301080	2305760	The reality is that like all splashy marketing announcements, these record-breaking rides
2305760	2311520	all had relatively short-lived impact and were regarded by the public as one-time novelties.
2311520	2315800	Yet the mainstream spotlight and the continuous headlines over the decades gave Six Flags
2315800	2320160	leadership the false confidence that the company branding was so strong they could get away
2320160	2324160	turning a blind eye towards the core guest experience.
2324160	2328760	Attention is overrated, fame is fleeting, and the real value in business and in life
2328760	2333480	is always from the mundane, unglamorous, quiet work behind the scenes that you never see
2333480	2334920	on camera.
2334920	2338880	When you're not the mouse or the wizard, you usually don't get a fairytale ending.
2338880	2342920	But for Six Flags, they'll keep getting chances to write their own as no one else will be
2342920	2345560	entering into this industry anytime soon.
