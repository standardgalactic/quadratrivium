Mr. McDonald, let's talk chicken.
Are you aware that the public prefers the taste of Kentucky nuggets to your chicken
muck nuggets by almost three to one?
No sir.
And is your muck chicken sandwich made with the Colonel's secret blend of eleven herbs
and spices?
No sir.
So how do you expect to sell chicken?
Toys!
Lots of toys!
It's our best.
A dollar ninety-nine for the Colonel's chicken sandwich and fries, or Kentucky nuggets and
fries.
Comes a time in every guy's life when, well, things begin to change.
You know what I'm talking about, fellas?
Suddenly wheels means cars instead of skateboards.
Look, let's broaden your horizons.
It's time to move on.
Instead of always reaching for that same old bag of potato chips, why not tear into a bag
a nacho cheese Doritos tortilla chips?
Bigger taste!
Bigger crunch!
Here's a snack chip that bites back.
Come on.

If you make a grilled chicken sandwich at Wendy's, they will come.
They will?
If you make it with a chicken breast, they will come.
It has to be boneless.
If you make it with lettuce and tomato.
And honey mustard.
And put it all together on a toasted bomb, they will come.
Call it Wendy's Grilled Chicken Sandwich.
Dave, I told you they will come.
It's Wendy.
I just can't figure out how she's doing it.
For fun around here, me and the boys liked to do something a little bit crazy.

Anything but love after Tuggy Hussein.
When Reggie and I agreed to meet for breakfast, I didn't think I needed to say where.

Then our regular microwave.
And it pops up more than any other light microwave.
It's going to keep my figure just like it is today.
Well, you're pretty good-looking, Grandpa, you know.
That's what Grandma says, too.
Yeah.
Not all of us can be as good-looking as you, Grandpa.
Well, that's true.

Why are beers that go down lightly watered down so heavily?
Why?
Ask.
Why?
Turn off the water and turn but dry.

Every day, 22 million people come into McDonald's.
They count on the same hot, fresh food
at every McDonald's all over the world.
But imagine if there were only one McDonald's,
you could count on.
And 22 million people came in at the same time.
The whole restaurant would fill up.
The city would fill up.
And all those people in one place
would cause the earth to tilt off its axis
and go spinning into space.
And that would make a real mess of everything.
That's why we make every McDonald's
from Poughkeepsie to Pomona
just as good as every other McDonald's,
thereby saving the universe.

In DeMonte, Washington, when a kid's 18,
he's old enough to drive, old enough to vote,
and old enough to worry about something most adults have,
gingivitis, an early reversible gum disease
that left untreated could get serious.
Just ask your dentist.
Fortunately, many know enough to use Listerine,
the only non-prescription mouthwash accepted
by the American Dental Association
for helping to prevent and reduce plaque in gingivitis.
Yep, if you're old enough to worry about gum disease,
you ought to be smart enough to use Listerine.
I want to try something different.
Can you make me look like that?
Tuesday, it's a brand new job.

What do you call it?
It's new ragu fresh Italian pasta sauce.
So delicate.
What's it called?
Fresh Italian pasta sauce.
Yeah, it's really fresh.
But what's the name of this?
See, ragu uses less heavy tomato paste
and twice the crushed tomatoes.
It's a very fresh tomato paste.
And twice the crushed tomatoes.
But what's the name of the sauce?

This morning, I was following a Sears service truck
when it dawned on me.
I see Sears trucks all the time.
It also dawned on me that I hardly ever see a service truck
from those so-called superstores.
So before you make that next big buying decision,
ask yourself what kind of service you'll get five years from now,
or if they'll even be around to answer the phone.
That's one of the big reasons I feel better
when I buy a major appliance or electronics from Sears.
And that's what they mean by your money's worth
and a whole lot more.
They've been selected because of their visions, their dreams,
and the roles they want to play as leaders in America's future.
And someday they may truly have a place in black history.

Just the thing.

You may have noticed lately
that lots of people are having considerable trouble
walking and chewing gum at the same time.
Perhaps it's because of the great taste of Trident.
Original fruit and bubble.

He's welcomed with Christ's freedom.
Who's the boss?
And at a special time,
net-baity guest stars.
That's a chemistry set.
Every boy should have one.
No, you shouldn't have done that, Ed.
We could just turn on the gas and blow ourselves up.

It's not so easy to grow beans, you know.
You have to water them,
pull up the weeds,

to keep the bunnies out.
Then you have to pick them carefully.
After that, you get to eat them.

Golden twirls are very delicious
and so much fun.
I wonder how they grow these.

And using it in ways you'd never figure.
Or even imagine.
So we tested it.
We ran at 6 million miles.
Everywhere.
Sometimes, nowhere.

Coming up tonight on Nightcast, the power of voodoo could have determined the outcome of Sunday Super Bowl.
And are the 49ers superstitious?
I have a little ritual I go through before the game and try to get myself as nervous as possible.
I'm just going to stay out of the small towns and stay away from the people working the voodoo.
Voodoo at the Super Bowl.
Live coverage from New Orleans continues tonight on Nightcast.
For years, we've been telling you how the four-wheel drive Subaru helps the U.S. ski team get to their events early.
Yet at the 1989 World Championships, the U.S. team was not the first to arrive.
The Norwegians beat us, the French beat us, as did the Italians and the Swedes.
How'd they do it?
That was the year we lent them all a Subaru.

There are very few guarantees in medicine.

This morning I was following a Sears service truck when it dawned on me.
I see Sears trucks all the time.
It also dawned on me that I hardly ever see a service truck from those so-called superstores.
So before you make that next big buying decision,
ask yourself what kind of service you'll get five years from now
or if they'll even be around to answer the phone.
That's one of the big reasons I feel better when I buy a major appliance or electronics from Sears.
And that's what they mean by your money's worth and a whole lot more.
This looks like something my mom would eat.
It's kind of quiet, conservative.
I don't think I can get into this.
I mean, it's just a bunch of flakes.
Hmm.
It doesn't taste the way it looks.
I like the way it crunches.
Maybe it's good because it's simple.
Wait, wait. Don't tell me. I'm just like my mother.

Now batting from around.
Kane.
I got into him.
This is Hubert Strohls.
Austrian downhill racer and Olympic gold medalist.
He's not afraid of extreme vertical drops.
He's not afraid of speeds over 90 miles an hour.
He's not afraid of anything except going slow.
But if you think he's tough,
wait till you see the guys at the ticket window
at the Olympics if you don't have your Visa card
because the Olympics don't take American Express.
Asa, it's every way you want to be.
We really missed you, man.
Really.
You were left all night long.
It was your kind of thing.
You made me laugh.
It was so embarrassing.
I haven't seen him in years.
It was great.
He still cracks me out.
I'll tell you one more time because I think I liked it.
I just did that.
We just did that, yeah.
No one helps you share the feelings like AT&T long distance.
I wish you could have been here, too.
AT&T, all you need to reach out.

You'll never forget the incident at Loom Lake
on One Life to Live.
Ford trucks.
The best.
Never a rest.
The first vehicle Henry Ford sold was not a car.
It was a truck.
Our full-size pickups were first with rear anti-lock brakes.
First with electronic overdrive transmission.
First with push-button four-wheel drive.
Now what does all this get you?
It gets you number one.
And if you keep doing it, you stay number one.
More people are driving the best-built,

We tend to have loud laughs and loud debates.
I think the newsroom is a microcosm of the community.
