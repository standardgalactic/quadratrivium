38000	42040	Are you aware that the public prefers the taste of Kentucky nuggets to your chicken
42040	45160	muck nuggets by almost three to one?
45160	46160	No sir.
46160	50280	And is your muck chicken sandwich made with the Colonel's secret blend of eleven herbs
50280	51280	and spices?
51280	52280	No sir.
52280	54640	So how do you expect to sell chicken?
54640	55640	Toys!
55640	58040	Lots of toys!
58040	59040	It's our best.
59040	62800	A dollar ninety-nine for the Colonel's chicken sandwich and fries, or Kentucky nuggets and
62800	64300	fries.
64300	66960	Comes a time in every guy's life when, well, things begin to change.
66960	68960	You know what I'm talking about, fellas?
68960	71760	Suddenly wheels means cars instead of skateboards.
71760	73400	Look, let's broaden your horizons.
73400	74400	It's time to move on.
74400	78040	Instead of always reaching for that same old bag of potato chips, why not tear into a bag
78040	80360	a nacho cheese Doritos tortilla chips?
80360	81360	Bigger taste!
81360	82360	Bigger crunch!

93440	94440	Dave.
94440	95440	Dave.
95440	100080	If you make a grilled chicken sandwich at Wendy's, they will come.
100080	101080	They will?
101080	104840	If you make it with a chicken breast, they will come.
104840	105840	It has to be boneless.
105840	109360	If you make it with lettuce and tomato.
109360	110360	And honey mustard.
110360	114760	And put it all together on a toasted bomb, they will come.
114760	117640	Call it Wendy's Grilled Chicken Sandwich.
117640	120320	Dave, I told you they will come.
120320	121320	It's Wendy.
121320	124320	I just can't figure out how she's doing it.
124320	128760	For fun around here, me and the boys liked to do something a little bit crazy.
128760	130840	Put two kinds of cheese on a cheeseburger.
130840	136000	For a while, new taste headed the store for two kinds of cheese and lean ground beef.
136000	138000	Cheddar and monster.
138000	139000	Crazy.

170040	171040	Wednesday.
171040	172040	This isn't just about sex.
172040	173040	No, no, why not?
174040	177040	There's a little about sex though, isn't it?
177040	179040	It's sort of nice on the phone.
179040	181040	It's a portable upbringing with me.
181040	183040	Things are really heating up.
183040	185040	Anything but love after Tuggy Hussein.
185040	190040	When Reggie and I agreed to meet for breakfast, I didn't think I needed to say where.
190040	192040	It could only be one place.
192040	196040	Where else can you get this delicious bacon egg and cheese biscuit?

234040	235040	This is really nice.
235040	237040	You don't have a party like this every night.

248040	251040	It's going to keep my figure just like it is today.
251040	253040	Well, you're pretty good-looking, Grandpa, you know.
253040	254040	That's what Grandma says, too.
254040	255040	Yeah.
255040	257040	Not all of us can be as good-looking as you, Grandpa.
257040	258040	Well, that's true.

331040	339040	Why are beers that go down lightly watered down so heavily?
339040	340040	Why?
340040	341040	Ask.
341040	343040	Why?
343040	347040	Turn off the water and turn but dry.
347040	352040	Its smooth draft taste is dry-brood, not watered down.
352040	356040	To drink light, yet satisfied completely.

551040	553040	American Airlines.
553040	555040	The on-time machine.
559040	562040	It was a big day when the new equipment arrived.
562040	563040	It's big.
563040	565040	The biggest one I've ever seen.
565040	568040	Of course, being a custom job, some assembly was required.
568040	570040	It'll be a few weeks, people.
570040	573040	But finally, it was ready.
573040	577040	One of the world's fastest check-writing systems.

774040	778040	Every day, 22 million people come into McDonald's.
778040	781040	They count on the same hot, fresh food
781040	783040	at every McDonald's all over the world.
783040	786040	But imagine if there were only one McDonald's,
786040	788040	you could count on.
788040	793040	And 22 million people came in at the same time.
797040	799040	The whole restaurant would fill up.
799040	801040	The city would fill up.
801040	803040	And all those people in one place
803040	806040	would cause the earth to tilt off its axis
806040	808040	and go spinning into space.
814040	818040	And that would make a real mess of everything.
821040	823040	That's why we make every McDonald's
823040	825040	from Poughkeepsie to Pomona
825040	828040	just as good as every other McDonald's,
828040	830040	thereby saving the universe.
832040	834040	While the Daytona Shelby Turbo
834040	837040	may not be quite as plush as the Aston Martin,
837040	840040	and the power plant isn't quite like a Lamborghini,
840040	843040	its new VNT turbo makes it one of the most powerful
843040	845040	front-wheel sports cars built in America.
845040	848040	And while it doesn't quite reach the speed of a Testerosa,
848040	851040	at that speed, you might miss something.
851040	854040	The all-new Dodge Daytona Shelby Turbo,
854040	856040	the hot new spirit of Dodge.
856040	860040	Now get up to $2,000 back at Dodge, guaranteed.
863040	865040	The bravest men.
865040	867040	Ain't no dream.
870040	872040	Are those with something to prove?
872040	874040	They gotta know that nobody's gonna let them fight.
874040	876040	And nothing to lose.
876040	878040	Someday they're gonna let the 54 get into us.
878040	880040	Matthew Broderick.
880040	881040	We'll be ready, sir.
881040	882040	Denzel Washington.
882040	883040	Come on!
883040	884040	Kerry Ellways.
884040	885040	Ready!
885040	887040	Morgan Freeman.
889040	891040	Glory Redditor.
891040	893040	Now playing at a theater near you.
895040	897040	In DeMonte, Washington, when a kid's 18,
897040	899040	he's old enough to drive, old enough to vote,
899040	902040	and old enough to worry about something most adults have,
902040	905040	gingivitis, an early reversible gum disease
905040	907040	that left untreated could get serious.
907040	909040	Just ask your dentist.
909040	911040	Fortunately, many know enough to use Listerine,
911040	913040	the only non-prescription mouthwash accepted
913040	915040	by the American Dental Association
915040	918040	for helping to prevent and reduce plaque in gingivitis.
918040	921040	Yep, if you're old enough to worry about gum disease,
921040	924040	you ought to be smart enough to use Listerine.
924040	926040	I want to try something different.
926040	928040	Can you make me look like that?
928040	930040	Tuesday, it's a brand new job.
930040	932040	Oh, I'm sure you can, Iris.
932040	933040	I'll go get the wand.
933040	935040	But she's the same old Roseanne.
935040	936040	Ben.
936040	938040	I'm not going to spend the rest of my life
938040	939040	spying some wire.
939040	941040	We all got chances, Elvis.
941040	943040	Some of them we just can't take.
943040	945040	In 1954, Vernon Presley wanted his son
945040	948040	to have a steady job with a secure future.
948040	951040	Well, I said, tell me, baby, what's wrong with you?
951040	955040	His dream came true, a special preview of Elvis Tuesday.
955040	958040	Sammy Davis Jr.'s 60th anniversary celebration
958040	960040	will continue in a moment.
960040	961040	You don't want, you don't get.
961040	962040	That's arithmetic.
962040	963040	Joe Kennedy.
963040	966040	He became the father of two senators and a president.
966040	968040	You were a very successful and wealthy man.
968040	969040	Isn't that winning?
969040	971040	No, not yet.
971040	973040	We had an appetite for power.
973040	975040	For the first Irish Catholic ambassador to England.
975040	977040	Wealth and women.
979040	982040	I never made history with anyone I've made love with.
982040	984040	How soon will you be home?
984040	987040	If there's any dirty work to be done, I'll be the one to do it.
987040	989040	The Kennedys of Massachusetts.
989040	991040	Two weeks from tonight.
994040	997040	To the eye, the Lexus LS-400
997040	1000040	looks like an elegantly contoured luxury sedan.
1008040	1010040	To the wind, however.
1011040	1014040	It doesn't look like much.
1014040	1016040	The Lexus LS-400,
1016040	1019040	the most aerodynamic luxury sedan in America.
1040040	1043040	The Lexus LS-400 says absolutely no cholesterol.
1043040	1045040	Now what could be better than sunshine?
1045040	1047040	Have a little sunshine.
1047040	1049040	Have a little sunshine.
1049040	1052040	Have a little sunshine.
1052040	1056040	Pentagon Waste reaches the billions on 7 at 11.
1060040	1062040	The producers of the show,
1062040	1065040	the producers of the show was hoping you'd have a little more feeling,
1065040	1068040	a little more Mike Tyson.
1068040	1070040	A little more Mike Tysonisms.
1070040	1072040	Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
1072040	1074040	Sammy and I would like...
1074040	1077040	To be continued...
1096040	1098040	It was Uchi.
1098040	1100040	Look, a little pale.
1100040	1102040	Maybe he needs a doctor or something.
1102040	1104040	Maybe I do.
1108040	1110040	What happened?
1110040	1112040	They hate on me.
1132040	1134040	You have to drive it to believe it.
1134040	1136040	The New Accord.
1138040	1140040	This is delicious, Danny.
1140040	1142040	What do you call it?
1142040	1144040	It's new ragu fresh Italian pasta sauce.
1144040	1146040	So delicate.
1146040	1148040	What's it called?
1148040	1150040	Fresh Italian pasta sauce.
1150040	1152040	Yeah, it's really fresh.
1152040	1154040	But what's the name of this?
1154040	1156040	See, ragu uses less heavy tomato paste
1156040	1158040	and twice the crushed tomatoes.
1158040	1160040	It's a very fresh tomato paste.
1160040	1162040	And twice the crushed tomatoes.
1162040	1164040	But what's the name of the sauce?
1164040	1166040	New ragu fresh Italian pasta sauce.
1166040	1168040	More crushed tomatoes, more fresh tomato taste.
1168040	1170040	Here's a jar.
1170040	1172040	Look, it has the name on it.
1172040	1174040	Forget it.
1174040	1176040	They instantly turn on.
1176040	1178040	You put that show lead on,
1178040	1180040	and that spark is right there.
1180040	1182040	That's the difference between a good dog and a great dog.
1182040	1184040	These are champions. They deserve the best.
1184040	1186040	And I recommend pedigree and pedigree meal time.
1186040	1188040	Pedigree.
1188040	1190040	Recommended by top breeders.
1190040	1192040	And now there's a new kind of pedigree.
1192040	1194040	Pedigree choice cuts.
1194040	1196040	Tender juicy meaty chunks with the sauce
1196040	1198040	dogs can't resist.
1198040	1200040	One look tells you it's choice.
1200040	1202040	One feeding shows you it's irresistible.
1202040	1204040	New pedigree choice cuts.
1204040	1206040	Recommended by top breeders.
1206040	1208040	My poor brother Tom,
1208040	1210040	every time he tried to see what he was missing,
1210040	1212040	he would miss what he was seeing.
1214040	1216040	Then Tom got this amazing Magnavox TV.
1216040	1218040	That lets him watch one show
1218040	1220040	while he checks out all the others
1220040	1222040	on this remarkable little window.
1222040	1224040	Hey, that's a smart window, Dick.
1224040	1226040	That's what they call it, Tom.
1226040	1228040	They call it Tom?
1228040	1230040	No, no, no. They call it smart window, Tom.
1230040	1232040	I don't know. I kind of like Tom.
1232040	1234040	Magnavox. Smart choice.
1234040	1236040	Very smart.
1236040	1238040	Friday.
1238040	1240040	I am now officially a teenager.
1240040	1242040	It's DJ's first kiss.
1242040	1244040	30 candles
1244040	1246040	to an all-new full house.
1246040	1248040	I'm the team.
1248040	1250040	Followed by a new Family Matters Friday.
1274040	1276040	Christ on New Yorker 5th Avenue.
1276040	1278040	If the rebate goes up,
1278040	1280040	Chrysler will pay you the difference.
1282040	1284040	I think I'm in love.
1284040	1285040	Who now?
1285040	1286040	That goddess.
1286040	1287040	I'm the rap.
1287040	1288040	Out of your league.
1288040	1289040	Oh, yeah?
1289040	1290040	Yeah.
1290040	1291040	Yeah.
1291040	1293040	Watch and learn.
1300040	1302040	May I have a towel?
1302040	1304040	Richard?
1304040	1306040	Never underestimate the doctor.
1308040	1310040	Hi, excuse me, y'all. Are you French?
1310040	1312040	You look French. I love French food.
1312040	1314040	This morning, I was following a Sears service truck
1314040	1316040	when it dawned on me.
1316040	1318040	I see Sears trucks all the time.
1318040	1321040	It also dawned on me that I hardly ever see a service truck
1321040	1323040	from those so-called superstores.
1323040	1326040	So before you make that next big buying decision,
1326040	1329040	ask yourself what kind of service you'll get five years from now,
1329040	1331040	or if they'll even be around to answer the phone.
1331040	1333040	That's one of the big reasons I feel better
1333040	1336040	when I buy a major appliance or electronics from Sears.
1336040	1339040	And that's what they mean by your money's worth
1339040	1341040	and a whole lot more.
1361040	1364040	They've been selected because of their visions, their dreams,
1364040	1367040	and the roles they want to play as leaders in America's future.
1367040	1371040	And someday they may truly have a place in black history.
1371040	1374040	Bitesize Ritz-Bitz Peanut Butter Sandwiches
1374040	1377040	The taste of Ritz-Bitz and real peanut butter in tiny sandwiches
1377040	1379040	with no assembly required.
1379040	1382040	Bitesize Ritz-Bitz Peanut Butter Sandwiches
1382040	1386040	The taste of Ritz-Bitz and real peanut butter in tiny sandwiches
1386040	1388040	with no assembly required.
1390040	1392040	Hey, wait for me!
1393040	1395040	Monday!
1395040	1397040	Stop raping the forest!
1397040	1400040	MacGyver goes out on a limb to save the trees.
1400040	1402040	I don't know what to do.
1402040	1404040	I don't know what to do.
1404040	1406040	I don't know what to do.
1406040	1409040	MacGyver goes out on a limb to save the trees.
1409040	1411040	I can handle it.
1411040	1414040	MacGyver, then, based on a true story.
1414040	1415040	Daddy, you're alive!
1415040	1417040	The father who refused to let his family die.
1417040	1420040	Mayday, mating. Two children stranded.
1420040	1423040	Robert Conrad, anything to survive, Monday.
1423040	1425040	I'm using this other long-distance company.
1425040	1427040	Try to call Phoenix. I miss style Fiji.
1427040	1428040	Pull him and knock him inside!
1428040	1431040	I call the operator. She says she can't give me instant credit.
1431040	1433040	I say AT&T always did.
1433040	1435040	She says, you're not dealing with AT&T.
1435040	1439040	If you miss dealing with AT&T, it's easier than ever to come back.
1439040	1445040	Just call 1-800-582-1700 right now and we'll switch you back for free.
1445040	1447040	They kept saying how much money I'd save.
1447040	1449040	Then I get the first bill.
1449040	1451040	I'm not kidding. I thought it was a typo.
1451040	1453040	I mean, where were the big savings?
1453040	1457040	People who thought they could do better than AT&T are coming back for the real value.
1457040	1462040	You can't do it simple. Just call now and come back for free.
1462040	1466040	It takes longer getting through, but I'm saving a ton, right? Wrong.
1466040	1467040	You gotta read the fine print.
1467040	1468040	Pull him and knock him inside!
1468040	1469040	I couldn't believe it.
1469040	1471040	You're not dealing with AT&T.
1471040	1472040	Well, I am now.
1472040	1478040	1-800-582-1700 for dependable crystal clear AT&T long-distance service.
1478040	1480040	Call now and we'll switch you for free.
1480040	1483040	You couldn't pick a better time to come back.
1483040	1487040	If you want an anti-lock braking system like Mercedes,
1487040	1490040	a driver airbag like BMW,
1490040	1494040	a rear load-leveling suspension feature similar to Rolls,
1494040	1497040	and a more advanced transmission than Jaguar,
1497040	1502040	this is a simple way to get it all.
1502040	1506040	Introducing the all-new Chrysler Imperial.

1515040	1522040	There's only one thing I used to hate worse than having to wash out my pantyhose every night.
1522040	1525040	And that was having to throw him out.
1525040	1529040	Pantyhose that lasts are no nonsense.
1529040	1533040	Ladies and gentlemen, Dennis Miller.
1538040	1541040	I just knew they'd call.
1545040	1548040	It's almost as if someone once said,
1548040	1550040	just in case people like sunshine and water,
1550040	1552040	we'd better make Florida.
1552040	1554040	And we'd better make miles of beautiful beaches
1554040	1557040	and places like St. Augustine and Key West,
1557040	1559040	just in case people want to go to them.
1559040	1563040	There are over 4 million miles of roads in Alamo territory,
1563040	1564040	all across America.
1564040	1568040	And nationwide, only Alamo gives you all those miles for free,
1568040	1573040	including the ones that run through a state that's named after sunshine.
1575040	1579040	Knowing how to read and write can really make you feel wanted.
1579040	1581040	Help someone learn to read.
1581040	1584040	Volunteer as a tutor in your community.
1585040	1586040	Tuesday.
1586040	1587040	Hi.
1587040	1588040	Hi.
1588040	1589040	I've missed you.
1589040	1590040	You're married.
1590040	1592040	It's a second chance for love.
1592040	1593040	What are we doing?
1593040	1594040	I can't do this.
1594040	1596040	I wish that you didn't have to go.
1596040	1598040	I'm in love with you.
1598040	1600040	30-something Tuesday.
1601040	1604040	The day may come when every freestanding range
1604040	1607040	will have a smooth, sealed-in surface that's easy to clean
1607040	1609040	and heats up this fast.
1609040	1613040	But Whirlpool has it today.
1617040	1619040	Hey, Mike, I really like this white sinfin' doll.
1619040	1620040	Well, good, good.
1620040	1621040	Now put it down.
1621040	1622040	We're going to try another one.
1622040	1624040	He loves to do this.
1624040	1625040	This one's great.
1625040	1627040	Yeah, I like it better.
1627040	1628040	Why?
1628040	1629040	Can't it just taste better?
1629040	1631040	Isn't that loud?
1631040	1633040	Did you know Gallo made a white sinfin' doll?
1633040	1634040	No, it's terrific, isn't it?
1634040	1636040	Am I going to get any credit for this?
1636040	1638040	Oh, yeah.
1638040	1643040	Ernest and Julio Gallo present a very special white sinfin' doll.
1643040	1646040	It will change the way you think about Gallo.
1646040	1647040	Wednesday.
1647040	1649040	The war is over.
1649040	1651040	It's the moment they've all been waiting for.
1651040	1652040	Forget your troubles.
1652040	1653040	Come on, get happy.
1653040	1655040	But is it really the end?
1655040	1656040	Don't you believe it?
1656040	1658040	When the wheels of my freedom bird lift off,
1658040	1659040	I'll believe it.
1659040	1660040	China Beach.
1662040	1664040	Alpha Beta shoppers are finding
1664040	1665040	when the new sign went up,
1665040	1667040	the prices came down.
1667040	1669040	For the last year I shopped at Alpha Beta,
1669040	1671040	and now that it's switched over to Lucky's,
1671040	1675040	I find a significant reduction in my weekly grocery bill.
1675040	1679040	It's important that I have quality and affordable prices,
1679040	1681040	and I find that I get both of that
1681040	1683040	when I shop at Lucky's.
1683040	1686040	Alpha Beta is now Lucky.
1686040	1688040	We think you'll like the change.
1694040	1695040	I want a ten minute breakfast,
1695040	1697040	so I'm bringing a clock to time.
1697040	1698040	You don't need a clock.
1698040	1699040	The waitress has a stopwatch.
1699040	1700040	If her watch is stopped,
1700040	1702040	how will I know when ten minutes are up?
1702040	1705040	Because if breakfast takes longer than ten minutes, it's free.
1705040	1707040	I get a broken watch for free?
1707040	1708040	I'm talking about breakfast.
1708040	1710040	And you've rambled on long enough.
1710040	1711040	It's time to go eat at Lenny's.
1711040	1712040	Denny's.
1712040	1713040	Denny's.
1714040	1718040	Now you can have your breakfast or lunch served in ten minutes,
1718040	1720040	or it's free, only at Denny's.
1724040	1727040	It's where individuals become a family.
1728040	1733040	It's where they share memories and news and opinions.
1734040	1736040	It's where parents get to know their children
1736040	1738040	and their children's children.
1739040	1742040	Homes will always be an important part of people's lives.
1742040	1745040	That's why home loans are such a secure investment.
1745040	1747040	And that's where Home Savings of America
1747040	1751040	has put its depositors' money for more than a hundred years.
1753040	1754040	Juice.
1756040	1757040	Quiet, please.
1759040	1761040	Oh no, I'm not here.
1761040	1763040	When allergies come on this strong,
1763040	1766040	Benadryl comes on stronger.
1768040	1771040	A change is coming, it's understood.
1771040	1774040	Happening all over my neighborhood.
1774040	1777040	Only one place got the taste for me.

1814040	1818040	and here's how people who are trying breakfast with grape nuts feel.
1818040	1819040	You've got to try it.
1819040	1821040	I did, and I feel great.
1821040	1825040	It's a great natural energy source, and it's fat-free.
1825040	1827040	You won't believe how good you feel.
1827040	1828040	I do.
1828040	1830040	I feel great.
1830040	1833040	Grape nuts cereal is full of complex carbohydrates.
1833040	1835040	You won't believe how it helps keep you going all morning.
1835040	1837040	Look for this display in your store.
1837040	1839040	Post-grape nuts trying is believing week.
1839040	1841040	You've got to do it.
1841040	1843040	Um, excuse me.
1843040	1847040	In a blind test, women compared new advanced formula
1847040	1849040	Agree shampoo to an expensive salon brand,
1849040	1851040	Red Can Amino Pond.
1851040	1853040	Guess which one they like better?
1853040	1856040	Agree. It's that good.
1857040	1860040	Aren't Ritz and Ritz-Bitz really the same?
1860040	1862040	Well, that's a silly question.
1862040	1864040	One's bigger, one's little.
1864040	1865040	So they're different.
1865040	1866040	But they're still the same.
1866040	1867040	So they're the same.
1867040	1869040	Don't you get it?
1869040	1872040	Ritz or Ritz-Bitz, two sizes fits all.
1872040	1873040	Wednesday.
1873040	1874040	I took buster to the vet.
1874040	1875040	And?
1875040	1877040	Honey, is there something wrong with him?
1877040	1878040	Well, nothing.
1878040	1879040	He can't be fixed.
1879040	1881040	You'll get sympathy pains on the Wonder Years.
1881040	1882040	Then?
1882040	1883040	You're playing.
1883040	1884040	A special episode.
1884040	1887040	Nobody makes blueberry pancakes like you do, Margaret.
1887040	1888040	Oh, those aren't blueberry pancakes.
1888040	1890040	Share memories of grandpa.
1890040	1893040	On Growing Pains, Wednesday.
1911040	1914040	To be the one company big enough and innovative enough

1946040	1948040	the same old line.
1968040	1970040	And more overall passenger space.
1970040	1972040	Stop having fun.
1972040	1973040	It doesn't add up.
1973040	1974040	The Isuzu Rodeo.
1974040	1976040	True, it doesn't add up.
1976040	1978040	Isuzu, there's no comparison.

1985040	1987040	And lots of men have heard about Rogaine.
1987040	1991040	But lots of men don't know that only Rogaine has Monoxadil.

2008040	2012040	Call 1-800-556-4800.
2027040	2030040	Some men would rather live their lives sheltered in the harbor.
2030040	2032040	And some would rather sail into life
2032040	2036040	with the unmistakable scent of Old Spice.
2036040	2039040	Clean, true, and classic, Old Spice.
2039040	2042040	One of the legends of the sea.
2045040	2047040	What are you sitting here doing?
2047040	2048040	Excuse me.
2048040	2049040	Aren't you glad you used dials?
2049040	2051040	To the airport. Let's go.
2051040	2052040	Are we over the window here?
2052040	2054040	Don't you wish everybody did?
2054040	2055040	Right, Rogaine.
2055040	2058040	Are you going to handle for this window?
2058040	2061040	So I start watching the Discovery Channel.
2061040	2062040	Thought maybe I'll learn something.
2062040	2064040	Then I see they have this guide, you know,
2064040	2066040	to kind of help you figure out when everything's on.
2066040	2067040	So I order it. Real easy.
2067040	2070040	Just 1-800-TDC-8343.
2070040	2071040	And I charge it.
2071040	2073040	And now a few weeks later, it's here.
2073040	2074040	I mean, look at this thing.
2074040	2075040	It's a magazine.
2075040	2078040	T-D-C Magazine.
2078040	2079040	I open it up.
2079040	2080040	And there's this grid,
2080040	2083040	which is great because I can see the whole week at a glance.
2083040	2085040	I just circle the shows I want to see.
2085040	2086040	And look at this.
2086040	2089040	It's a complete description of every single show.
2089040	2090040	And check this out.
2090040	2092040	These photographs. Gorgeous.
2092040	2095040	There's even articles by famous authors.
2095040	2096040	Amazing.
2096040	2098040	All I expected was a program guide,
2098040	2099040	and I get all this.
2099040	2101040	What a bargain.
2101040	2104040	I wonder if they'll ever be a swimsuit issue.
2104040	2107040	Call now to order your T-D-C Magazine
2107040	2110040	and receive 12 monthly issues for only $14.95.
2110040	2112040	That's more than 50% off the cover price.
2112040	2114040	Or tell the operator to bill you later.
2114040	2117040	These and MasterCard accepted.
2117040	2120040	It's never one food that gives you what you need.
2120040	2122040	It's the combination and the balance.
2122040	2124040	And how you balance the combinations.
2124040	2126040	So at McDonald's, there's lots to choose from.
2126040	2129040	Lean burgers to low-fat shakes and frozen yogurt.
2129040	2130040	Salads.
2130040	2131040	No fat.
2131040	2132040	No cholesterol.
2132040	2133040	Apple brand muffins.
2133040	2136040	And cholesterol free oil for our chicken, potatoes, and fish.
2136040	2139040	We've got a long list of good foods to choose from.
2139040	2143040	All you've got to do is just choose the food for you.
2143040	2144040	Always good food.
2144040	2148040	Always good value at McDonald's.
2148040	2150040	It can be downright frustrating
2150040	2153040	and difficult to get perfect orange juice.
2153040	2156040	One with that pure fresh squeeze taste
2156040	2159040	with no water added or taken away.
2159040	2162040	But if you remember that no other major brand of juice
2162040	2164040	comes closer to this,
2164040	2167040	than this Tropicana Pure Premium,
2167040	2172040	you'll think you'll find everything will just fall into place.
2172040	2174040	Tropicana Pure Premium.
2174040	2177040	Also appearing in 96 ounces.
2178040	2183040	Call me irresponsible.
2183040	2185040	Just because the other guy is on the road
2185040	2187040	doesn't mean his mind is.
2187040	2190040	So the superb traction of the Subaru Legacy
2190040	2192040	with four-wheel drive and anti-lock brakes
2192040	2194040	can be quite a comfort.
2194040	2197040	Since the next guy is capable of almost anything,
2197040	2200040	shouldn't the same be true of your next car?
2202040	2205040	Factory to dealer cash could mean great savings to you
2205040	2207040	during the Subaru Spring Value Days.
2207040	2209040	Three hours, nine minutes.
2209040	2210040	May I ask what you're doing?
2210040	2212040	Timing tiny time pills.
2212040	2213040	Excuse me?
2213040	2214040	Well, this morning when I woke up, I talked like this,
2214040	2215040	and I didn't like that.
2215040	2216040	So I took a contact.
2216040	2220040	So, well, contact has 600 tiny time pills at last 12 hours.
2220040	2222040	Up to three times longer than ordinary cold medicine.
2222040	2225040	There's a whole day's work in every contact.
2225040	2227040	Eight hours and 30 seconds.
2227040	2230040	Look, if you're going to time the tiny time pills all day,
2230040	2231040	when are you going to do the work?
2231040	2232040	Right.
2232040	2234040	You time.
2234040	2237040	There's a whole day's work in every contact.
2237040	2239040	Coming to ABC.
2239040	2240040	I'll give you three and a half in time served.
2240040	2242040	No way. Two years tops.
2242040	2243040	Three. Two and a half.
2243040	2244040	Three or no deal.
2244040	2245040	Done.
2245040	2248040	You know something's wrong and you still want to try this case?
2248040	2251040	You said you took it on the cases nobody else wanted.
2252040	2256040	How the hell are we supposed to win a case without witnesses?
2256040	2257040	They'll deny it.
2257040	2260040	Oh, your honor, we got a big problem here.
2260040	2261040	Treat Williams.
2261040	2263040	You mean you're a real lawyer?
2263040	2264040	Surprise.

2268040	2270040	Announcing something you've never seen before

2273040	2276040	Color.
2276040	2277040	Lifetime.
2277040	2281040	No wonder many of us seem to always make bell calling card.
2281040	2285040	You can easily charge calls wherever you are,
2285040	2290040	whether you're just down the street or somewhere up the coast.
2290040	2296040	But unlike most calling cards, Pacific Bells is based on your own familiar phone number.
2296040	2299040	And since it's welcome at most every phone,
2299040	2303040	it's really the only calling card you need to hang on to.
2303040	2307040	Pacific Bell, we're making things easier everywhere.
2312040	2314040	McDonald's explodes another myth.

2558040	2560040	So young and yet so glum.
2560040	2562040	Changing time was just no fun.
2562040	2564040	But old mother Goose waved her wing
2564040	2566040	and put all the magic of story time

2577040	2579040	Now Sam and Samantha are full of glee
2579040	2581040	in new story time Huggies.
2581040	2584040	And changing time is happy as can be.
2584040	2586040	You may have noticed lately
2586040	2588040	that lots of people are having considerable trouble
2588040	2590040	walking and chewing gum at the same time.
2590040	2593040	Perhaps it's because of the great taste of Trident.
2593040	2595040	Original fruit and bubble.
2595040	2597040	Trident. Good for your teeth.
2597040	2599040	And great taste too.
2599040	2600040	But I told him.
2600040	2602040	Well look, maybe the guy wasn't listening.
2602040	2604040	Oh, here it comes.
2608040	2611040	When allergies come on this strong,
2611040	2614040	Benadryl comes on stronger.
2615040	2617040	Oh boy, you know, Roger,
2617040	2620040	I haven't seen anything this nasty since Rosie.
2620040	2622040	What do you want?
2622040	2623040	A monkey.
2623040	2625040	It's gonna be a belly-wagger.
2625040	2627040	Wow, good night.
2627040	2629040	Turn up the light.
2633040	2635040	Uh-oh.
2637040	2638040	Little Caesars.
2638040	2639040	Cheezer-Cheezer.
2639040	2641040	Not one, but two pizzas loaded with cheese
2641040	2643040	and up to five toppings for $8.98.
2643040	2645040	Cheezer-Cheezer.
2645040	2647040	Bravely, Fred has faced one too many healthy
2647040	2649040	but boring breakfast.
2649040	2650040	Enough!
2650040	2652040	I want taste, indulgence.
2652040	2654040	Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats.
2654040	2655040	A friend.
2655040	2657040	Ooh, naughty frosting.
2657040	2659040	Freddy, Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats
2659040	2661040	are good for you, there's fiber.
2661040	2662040	No.
2662040	2663040	And no salt.
2663040	2665040	But they taste so good.
2665040	2667040	And they're fat-free, see?
2667040	2668040	Fat-free?
2668040	2669040	Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats.
2669040	2671040	Surprise, they're good for you.
2671040	2673040	You see it your way?
2673040	2675040	I see it mine.
2675040	2677040	We're all going to Italy Tuesday
2677040	2679040	when Tony and Harrods are vineyard.
2679040	2681040	Greetings, fellow villagers.
2681040	2683040	He's welcomed with Christ's freedom.
2683040	2684040	Who's the boss?
2684040	2685040	And at a special time,
2685040	2687040	net-baity guest stars.
2687040	2688040	That's a chemistry set.
2688040	2689040	Every boy should have one.
2689040	2691040	No, you shouldn't have done that, Ed.
2691040	2693040	We could just turn on the gas and blow ourselves up.
2693040	2695040	An hour on Roseanne and...
2695040	2697040	I flew here this morning from Colombia.
2697040	2699040	A dope smuggler swallows his stage.
2699040	2701040	If somebody dies, it's not your fault, is it?
2701040	2702040	No, not totally.
2702040	2704040	What percentage would you say?
2704040	2706040	Stat Tuesday.
2729040	2731040	Johnson's brings out the baby soft shine
2731040	2733040	born in your hair.
2759040	2761040	Double fresh, double good.
2761040	2762040	Come on and double it.
2762040	2764040	Double meat, double meat.
2764040	2765040	Gone.
2765040	2767040	There's no single come light.
2768040	2770040	It's not so easy to grow beans, you know.
2770040	2772040	You have to water them,
2772040	2774040	pull up the weeds,
2774040	2776040	and tie them up so they can reach the sun.
2776040	2778040	Then your mother has to help you build a fence
2778040	2780040	to keep the bunnies out.
2780040	2782040	Then you have to pick them carefully.
2782040	2785040	After that, you get to eat them.
2785040	2787040	And if you're lucky,
2787040	2789040	your mother will make a ride of golden twirls
2789040	2791040	to go with them.
2791040	2793040	Golden twirls are very delicious
2793040	2795040	and so much fun.
2795040	2797040	I wonder how they grow these.
2798040	2802040	The average driver puts 12 to 13,000 miles a year on a car.
2802040	2804040	At Saturn, we knew this.
2805040	2807040	Where and how, though, is anyone's guess.
2807040	2809040	For sure, we knew people would be taking
2809040	2811040	to new Saturn places.
2811040	2814040	And using it in ways you'd never figure.
2814040	2816040	Or even imagine.
2816040	2818040	So we tested it.
2818040	2820040	We ran at 6 million miles.
2820040	2822040	Everywhere.
2822040	2824040	Sometimes, nowhere.
2828040	2830040	Wednesday, Kevin's got a big problem
2830040	2832040	with Paul's little sister.
2832040	2834040	I'm not taking your sister to the catillion.
2834040	2836040	I mean, you're gonna have to tell her.
2836040	2838040	Unpleasant as it might be.
2838040	2840040	It was time to break a heart.
2840040	2842040	Would you go with me?
2842040	2844040	The wonder years.
2844040	2847040	It's European holiday and Mike's getting a head start.
2847040	2849040	Party! Party!
2849040	2851040	It's a tale of two vacations.
2851040	2852040	Happy anniversary.
2852040	2854040	I'm stranded in Spain with a crazy woman.
2854040	2856040	Catch all the fun Wednesday.
2874040	2876040	With great burger taste and a lot less fat.
2876040	2878040	But don't fill up on the press.
2878040	2879040	Taste for yourself.
2879040	2881040	One bite and you'll be talking about it, too.
2881040	2882040	The Swallow First.
2882040	2883040	New Maclean Deluxe.
2883040	2885040	After billions and billions.
2885040	2887040	Another first at McDonald's today.
2889040	2892040	Bradley decided to express his artistic talent
2892040	2894040	on the living room wall.
2894040	2896040	A little more covered in one coat.
2896040	2897040	They're so cute at that age.
2897040	2899040	You can't get mad at them.
2899040	2900040	Wanna bet?
2900040	2902040	Are you sure you have everything?
2902040	2903040	Yeah.
2903040	2904040	Turn around.
2904040	2905040	Hmm.
2905040	2908040	I got the Fuji film while you were in cosmetics.
2908040	2909040	I didn't forget.
2909040	2910040	Oh.
2910040	2911040	You forgot you married the perfect husband.
2911040	2912040	You were right, Dad.
2912040	2913040	Kmart's pretty cool.
2913040	2915040	You should listen to me more often.
2919040	2922040	Of all pine cleaners, more people choose pine saw.
2922040	2924040	Pine saw's got more active ingredients
2924040	2926040	than the next leading brand.
2926040	2928040	And pine saw disinfects better.
2928040	2930040	It even kills staff germs.
2930040	2932040	It's not really clean until...
2932040	2934040	It's pine-solved.
2934040	2938040	Friday on Full House, Joey and Jesse get close to nature.
2938040	2939040	Woo-hoo!
2941040	2943040	Mr. Fox!
2943040	2946040	Maybe even a little too close.
2946040	2948040	Ooh-la-la!
2948040	2951040	It's time for a boy to become a man.
2951040	2953040	Your mother sent out 150 invitations
2953040	2956040	and we got 10 tons of potato salad downstairs.
2956040	2957040	Rejoice!
2957040	2960040	Robbie comes of age on his howling day.
2960040	2963040	And all new dinosaurs ride up to Full House Friday.
2963040	2964040	This one for me?
2990040	2992040	Is this your kid?
2992040	2994040	And is he drinking the only juice drink
2994040	2997040	with a full day's vitamin C, four other vitamins,
2997040	2998040	and all natural flavors?
2998040	3000040	Well, maybe this isn't your kid.
3000040	3002040	But this should be your kid.

3591160	3592160	Yeah, I know.
3592160	3593160	What?
3593160	3594160	It was cheaper.
3594160	3595160	I saved a few cents.
3595160	3597160	Mom, it's not the cheesiest.
3597160	3598160	What's the difference?

3603160	3607160	Mom, you never serve anything but Kraft cheese and macaroni, right?

3711160	3714160	And are the 49ers superstitious?
3714160	3719160	I have a little ritual I go through before the game and try to get myself as nervous as possible.
3719160	3723160	I'm just going to stay out of the small towns and stay away from the people working the voodoo.
3723160	3725160	Voodoo at the Super Bowl.

3733160	3740160	For years, we've been telling you how the four-wheel drive Subaru helps the U.S. ski team get to their events early.
3740160	3746160	Yet at the 1989 World Championships, the U.S. team was not the first to arrive.
3746160	3752160	The Norwegians beat us, the French beat us, as did the Italians and the Swedes.
3752160	3754160	How'd they do it?
3754160	3762160	That was the year we lent them all a Subaru.
3762160	3767160	Imagine a Disneyland as big as the city of San Francisco.

3811160	3813160	His worst nightmare is taking shape.
3813160	3816160	My children are going to be living under the same roof as a rapist.
3816160	3818160	His last resort, an act of desperation.
3818160	3821160	Speak now or else forever holds your peace.
3821160	3824160	I'm going to yell rapist or rapist.
3824160	3828160	I'm not slanting. Thursday.
3828160	3831160	This is CBS.
3831160	3836160	It's the biggest party in the history of Disneyland.
3836160	3842160	Disneyland's year-long 35th anniversary celebration with the biggest parade we've ever staged.

3859160	3861160	It's Disneyland's big.
3882160	3885160	You know where it's at.
3885160	3889160	At your Northern California Mazda dealer now.
3893160	3896160	There are very few guarantees in medicine.
3896160	3902160	But if you have arthritis pain like I do, you should know about Mediprin and the Mediprin guarantee.
3902160	3908160	If two Mediprin don't relieve minor arthritis pain better than two regular aspirin, you get your money back.
3908160	3909160	Strong promise?
3909160	3910160	Strong medicine.
3910160	3914160	The medicine that concentrates the power of ibuprofen into these potent little caplets.
3914160	3918160	The medicine that guarantees better relief than regular aspirin.
3918160	3922160	Better arthritis pain relief. That's the Mediprin guarantee.
3922160	3925160	They know they want to win. They look at the judge and they ask for it.
3925160	3927160	The show dog begins with what you feed it.
3927160	3930160	I mix the pedigree with the pedigree meal time because the dogs enjoy it.
3930160	3931160	It's the perfect combination.
3931160	3933160	These are champions. They deserve the best.
3933160	3937160	Pedigree. Recommended by top breeders.
3937160	3943160	Right now you're just 90 seconds away from Chef Boyardee with microwave meals.
3943160	3947160	Chef Boyardee pasta hot and tasty and with no messy cleanup.
3947160	3949160	Chef Boyardee microwave meals.
3949160	3952160	Thank goodness in just 90 seconds.
3952160	3956160	This morning I was following a Sears service truck when it dawned on me.
3956160	3958160	I see Sears trucks all the time.
3958160	3963160	It also dawned on me that I hardly ever see a service truck from those so-called superstores.
3963160	3966160	So before you make that next big buying decision,
3966160	3969160	ask yourself what kind of service you'll get five years from now
3969160	3972160	or if they'll even be around to answer the phone.
3972160	3977160	That's one of the big reasons I feel better when I buy a major appliance or electronics from Sears.
3977160	3981160	And that's what they mean by your money's worth and a whole lot more.
3983160	3985160	This looks like something my mom would eat.
3985160	3989160	It's kind of quiet, conservative.
3989160	3991160	I don't think I can get into this.
3991160	3994160	I mean, it's just a bunch of flakes.
3994160	3995160	Hmm.
3995160	3998160	It doesn't taste the way it looks.
3998160	4000160	I like the way it crunches.
4000160	4003160	Maybe it's good because it's simple.
4003160	4006160	Wait, wait. Don't tell me. I'm just like my mother.
4006160	4008160	Kellogg's Corn Flakes.
4008160	4009160	Corn Flakes?
4009160	4012160	Taste them again for the first time.
4012160	4014160	I hope you'll be with us tonight.
4014160	4016160	Dan Miller will be live from New Orleans inside the Super Bowl
4016160	4018160	bringing you updates on goodness knows what
4018160	4020160	along with actress Karen Black and much more.
4020160	4022160	See you later tonight.
4022160	4024160	One, two, three.
4024160	4027160	On tour with Paul McCartney.
4027160	4029160	There is life after Beatles.

4039160	4042160	Dr. Pepper and your local Dr. Pepper bottler.
4042160	4044160	Dr. Pepper is just what the doctor ordered.
4044160	4049160	The good time, great taste of McDonald's.
4049160	4053160	AT&T, the right choice.
4053160	4055160	And Chrysler Corporation and the Chrysler Motorist
4055160	4058160	Black Dealers Association.
4061160	4063160	What do you like about your Eagle Premier?
4063160	4064160	Everything.
4064160	4066160	You mean the leather interior and the roominess?
4066160	4068160	I said everything.
4068160	4071160	So what's Premier got that other cars in his class don't they?
4071160	4072160	Me.
4074160	4076160	You test drove the Maxima?
4076160	4077160	You got it.
4077160	4078160	The Taurus and the Cressida?
4078160	4079160	You got it.
4079160	4080160	Then you tried the Eagle Premier?
4080160	4081160	You got it.
4081160	4082160	What'd you think?
4082160	4084160	I got it.
4092160	4094160	All the phone cords that bind,
4094160	4097160	that hold your small business back.
4097160	4101160	Now AT&T can set you free with the first cordless phone
4101160	4103160	specifically designed for business.
4103160	4105160	The multi-line Merlin cordless.
4105160	4108160	It works with AT&T's small business phone systems
4108160	4112160	so you don't have to lose any quality to gain your freedom.
4112160	4114160	Set your business free.
4114160	4120160	Call 1-800-MERLIN-ATT for the new Merlin cordless.
4123160	4124160	Who's weather?
4124160	4125160	Kate.
4125160	4126160	Pitch a maroon as due up.
4126160	4127160	Kate.
4127160	4129160	So Burns is going to have to do his pinch.
4129160	4131160	The only choice is John Kane.
4131160	4133160	Hey, kid.
4133160	4134160	Can't be the doc?
4134160	4135160	Burns has been reluctant.
4135160	4137160	It's Kane's friend to go with the younger players,
4137160	4139160	but he may not have a choice here tonight.
4139160	4140160	Now batting from around.
4140160	4141160	Kane.
4147160	4149160	I got into him.
4152160	4154160	This is Hubert Strohls.
4154160	4158160	Austrian downhill racer and Olympic gold medalist.
4158160	4161160	He's not afraid of extreme vertical drops.
4161160	4165160	He's not afraid of speeds over 90 miles an hour.
4165160	4169160	He's not afraid of anything except going slow.
4169160	4170160	But if you think he's tough,
4170160	4172160	wait till you see the guys at the ticket window
4172160	4175160	at the Olympics if you don't have your Visa card
4175160	4179160	because the Olympics don't take American Express.
4179160	4182160	Asa, it's every way you want to be.
4182160	4184160	We really missed you, man.
4184160	4185160	Really.
4185160	4187160	You were left all night long.
4187160	4189160	It was your kind of thing.
4189160	4192160	You made me laugh.
4192160	4194160	It was so embarrassing.
4194160	4195160	I haven't seen him in years.
4195160	4196160	It was great.
4196160	4197160	He still cracks me out.
4197160	4199160	I'll tell you one more time because I think I liked it.
4199160	4200160	I just did that.
4200160	4202160	We just did that, yeah.
4202160	4206160	No one helps you share the feelings like AT&T long distance.
4206160	4208160	I wish you could have been here, too.
4208160	4212160	AT&T, all you need to reach out.
4212160	4215160	I love chasing quarterbacks.
4217160	4219160	When you've got the style of Hanes socks,
4219160	4222160	who wants to run around and cleats?
4222160	4228160	Hanes, nothing else feels so right.
4228160	4229160	Like to try total?
4229160	4230160	Mom says grape nuts.
4230160	4231160	Hope you're hungry.
4231160	4232160	It takes four bowls of grape nuts
4232160	4235160	to get the vitamins in one bowl of total.
4235160	4237160	Total has 100% of a day's supply
4237160	4239160	of 12 vitamins and minerals.
4239160	4240160	You tell her.
4240160	4244160	Total, one bowl, 100%.
4244160	4247160	Red Lobster announces great new trios.
4247160	4249160	Six delicious trios you're going to love.
4249160	4250160	Terrific.
4250160	4252160	Like our large butterfly shrimp.
4252160	4254160	Lobster alfredo and scallops.
4254160	4255160	Love it.
4255160	4256160	Or our crab legs.
4256160	4258160	Juicy scallops and shrimp.
4258160	4259160	Let's go.
4259160	4263160	But hurry, our great new trios won't last long.
4263160	4267160	Red Lobster for the secret lover.
4267160	4269160	Try the trio with the unbeatable price.
4269160	4271160	Our Atlantic trio, just $6.99.
4271160	4272160	$6.99?
4272160	4274160	That's incredible.
4274160	4276160	On One Life to Live, the start of a love affair.
4276160	4278160	This is going to be a good trip.
4278160	4280160	Or the beginning of the end.
4280160	4281160	Oh.
4281160	4283160	It's an attraction that could be fatal.
4283160	4284160	You're perfectly safe in the boat.
4284160	4285160	Trust me.
4285160	4287160	You'll never forget the incident at Loom Lake
4287160	4289160	on One Life to Live.
4289160	4292160	Ford trucks.
4292160	4293160	The best.
4293160	4295160	Never a rest.
4295160	4298160	The first vehicle Henry Ford sold was not a car.
4298160	4299160	It was a truck.
4299160	4302160	Our full-size pickups were first with rear anti-lock brakes.
4302160	4305160	First with electronic overdrive transmission.
4305160	4307160	First with push-button four-wheel drive.
4307160	4308160	Now what does all this get you?
4308160	4310160	It gets you number one.
4310160	4314160	And if you keep doing it, you stay number one.
4314160	4316160	More people are driving the best-built,
4316160	4319160	best-selling American trucks than ever before.
4329160	4331160	Fresh in breath and taste great.
4335160	4337160	People who use plain-calamine lotions to relieve itches
4337160	4340160	or poison ivy are easy to spot.
4340160	4343160	But new-caladrial clear not only works better to stop the itch,
4343160	4345160	it dries this clear.
4345160	4348160	So nobody will ever spot you.
4348160	4350160	New-caladrial clear.
4350160	4352160	One man unwilling to forgive.
4352160	4355160	You break the law, it'll come running back to me.
4355160	4357160	The other unable to forget.
4357160	4359160	I swore an oath to my country,
4359160	4361160	not to what was going on over there.

4394160	4396160	We are an eclectic mix.
4396160	4398160	Everyone comes from different backgrounds.
4398160	4401160	We are a boisterous, diversified group.
4401160	4405160	Everyone has their own ideas in the newsroom about how they think the day should go.
4405160	4409160	We tend to have loud laughs and loud debates.

4592160	4594160	Repeat 4 bucks.
