1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
We need more fog that leaves us with an escape.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,840
We need more fog that leaves us with an paradise.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:12,180
I spend all my time working in thisくるくる of a gym for a whole week.

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,380
We need more fog like this.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,540
We need more fog like this.

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,420
We need more fog like this.

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,200
We need more fog, not even 10 million pounds.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,420
Our parking space is big and kayak今路が mile them.

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,120
What about bed Seong-dol?

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm not going to make it.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Mr. McDonald, let's talk chicken.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,040
Are you aware that the public prefers the taste of Kentucky nuggets to your chicken

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,160
muck nuggets by almost three to one?

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
No sir.

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,280
And is your muck chicken sandwich made with the Colonel's secret blend of eleven herbs

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
and spices?

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,280
No sir.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,640
So how do you expect to sell chicken?

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
Toys!

20
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,040
Lots of toys!

21
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
It's our best.

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,800
A dollar ninety-nine for the Colonel's chicken sandwich and fries, or Kentucky nuggets and

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,300
fries.

24
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,960
Comes a time in every guy's life when, well, things begin to change.

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,960
You know what I'm talking about, fellas?

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,760
Suddenly wheels means cars instead of skateboards.

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,400
Look, let's broaden your horizons.

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
It's time to move on.

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,040
Instead of always reaching for that same old bag of potato chips, why not tear into a bag

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,360
a nacho cheese Doritos tortilla chips?

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
Bigger taste!

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
Bigger crunch!

33
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,480
Here's a snack chip that bites back.

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,200
Come on.

35
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,440
Nacho cheese Doritos.

36
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
Come in now.

37
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
You can handle that.

38
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
Come on.

39
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,440
Punch all you want.

40
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,440
We'll make more.

41
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
Dave.

42
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
Dave.

43
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,080
If you make a grilled chicken sandwich at Wendy's, they will come.

44
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
They will?

45
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,840
If you make it with a chicken breast, they will come.

46
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
It has to be boneless.

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,360
If you make it with lettuce and tomato.

48
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
And honey mustard.

49
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,760
And put it all together on a toasted bomb, they will come.

50
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,640
Call it Wendy's Grilled Chicken Sandwich.

51
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,320
Dave, I told you they will come.

52
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
It's Wendy.

53
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,320
I just can't figure out how she's doing it.

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,760
For fun around here, me and the boys liked to do something a little bit crazy.

55
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,840
Put two kinds of cheese on a cheeseburger.

56
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,000
For a while, new taste headed the store for two kinds of cheese and lean ground beef.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Cheddar and monster.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Crazy.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,440
Things do go bump in the night.

60
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,160
There are boogeymen.

61
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,600
Fortunately, Silly's exclusive post-hypothetic sleep system is designed to support everyone

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,440
differently.

63
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,440
More comfortably to keep your night from becoming your worst nightmare.

64
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,040
For a better night's sleep, better sleep on a Silly.

65
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Wednesday.

66
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
This isn't just about sex.

67
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
No, no, why not?

68
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,040
There's a little about sex though, isn't it?

69
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,040
It's sort of nice on the phone.

70
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,040
It's a portable upbringing with me.

71
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
Things are really heating up.

72
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Anything but love after Tuggy Hussein.

73
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,040
When Reggie and I agreed to meet for breakfast, I didn't think I needed to say where.

74
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,040
It could only be one place.

75
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Where else can you get this delicious bacon egg and cheese biscuit?

76
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,040
So much for him.

77
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Nice move, Jack.

78
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,040
The Prelude SI with four-wheel steering from Honda.

79
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,040
Grandpa, you think you could have a party every time you come out with a new product?

80
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
This is really nice.

81
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
You don't have a party like this every night.

82
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
This is big.

83
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
This is really big.

84
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
This new light microwave popcorn.

85
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
With one-third fewer calories and two-thirds less fat.

86
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
Then our regular microwave.

87
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,040
And it pops up more than any other light microwave.

88
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,040
It's going to keep my figure just like it is today.

89
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Well, you're pretty good-looking, Grandpa, you know.

90
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
That's what Grandma says, too.

91
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
Yeah.

92
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Not all of us can be as good-looking as you, Grandpa.

93
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
Well, that's true.

94
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
That's true.

95
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Now, at Little Caesars, you can get Picnic Picnic.

96
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,040
Two medium pizzas, two orders of crazy bread,

97
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,040
and two servings of Coke Classic, all for only $7.98.

98
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,040
It's Picnic Picnic.

99
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Two pizzas, two orders of crazy bread,

100
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:14,040
and two servings of Coke Classic, all for only $7.98.

101
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,040
It's Picnic Picnic.

102
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Two pizzas, two crazy breads, two soft drinks,

103
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,040
all that food for only $7.98.

104
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,040
And it rains at fours.

105
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,040
Picnic Picnic only at Little Caesars.

106
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Pizza, pizza.

107
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Why are beers that go down lightly watered down so heavily?

108
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Why?

109
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Ask.

110
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,040
Why?

111
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Turn off the water and turn but dry.

112
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Its smooth draft taste is dry-brood, not watered down.

113
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,040
To drink light, yet satisfied completely.

114
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,040
So why get soaked?

115
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,040
When you can drink but dry.

116
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,040
A baby changes everything.

117
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Safety takes on a whole new meaning when it's somebody you love in that car.

118
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
This is our family.

119
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,040
They're the most technically advanced and life-like dummies in the world.

120
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Only GM uses a family like this to develop safety technology

121
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,040
because we know quality cars, safe cars, should help protect everyone.

122
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,040
I look at my family and I want us to be thinking of everything.

123
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,040
GM's safety, it's not one thing, it's everything.

124
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,040
She's everything to me.

125
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Dorothy, you marry me or is my ring a lifesaver?

126
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
It's a beginning.

127
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Don't worry.

128
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
I'll give it to my mother.

129
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Lifesavers candy isn't life delicious.

130
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,040

131
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,040

A pose in a pack.

152
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
One, two, three bites big.

153
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040

Snack around the house size.

157
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,040

Cold winds out of the north-northwest.

166
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,040
With a 30% chance of snow tonight.

167
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Temperature dropping into low 20.

168
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,040
At last, a weather-proof formula that holds longer

169
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,040
and stronger than the other leading pumps.

00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040

Saturday, this June, your 60th anniversary celebration

175
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,040
will continue in a moment.

176
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,040
This is what American Airlines does better

177
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
than anyone else.

178
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Arrive on time.

179
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Again and again.

180
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,040
In fact, American has had the best on-time arrival record

181
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
of the nine largest domestic airlines

182
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,040
for as long as records have been kept.

183
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
American Airlines.

184
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
The on-time machine.

185
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,040
It was a big day when the new equipment arrived.

186
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
It's big.

187
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
The biggest one I've ever seen.

188
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,040
Of course, being a custom job, some assembly was required.

189
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,040
It'll be a few weeks, people.

190
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,040
But finally, it was ready.

191
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,040
One of the world's fastest check-writing systems.

192
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Some insurance companies look for ways

193
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,040
to get your money from you faster.

194
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Here should do 12,000 an hour.

195
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,040
At Ethna, we look for ways to get your money to you faster.

196
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
Probe of misconduct by Oakland Housing Police.

197
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
On 7 at 11.

198
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,040
So your woman's body is merely a frame.

199
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,040
Homicides were created to release.

200
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,040
Pants are mandatory.

201
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,040
And to pass, you won't see a leg in Paris disappear.

202
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
Perfume and infusion.

203
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
The short skirt is dead.

204
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
My designs...

205
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,040
No matter what the gentleman prefers,

206
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,040
the lady prefers hands.

207
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,040
Carnation instant breakfast.

208
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
You gotta love it in an instant.

209
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
Wake up to the nutritious, delicious taste

210
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
of Carnation instant breakfast.

211
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,040
Carnation instant breakfast.

212
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,040
You gotta love it in an instant.

213
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Hey, dog lovers.

214
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,040
This is ordinary dog food.

215
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Feast your eyes on Grand Gourmet.

216
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,040
25% more protein and less fat than leading brands.

217
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
Grand Gourmet.

218
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
It now looks better. It is better.

219
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,040
399, golden fried shrimp and grilled chicken breast

220
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,040
with salad and baked potato.

221
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,040
Just 399 for a limited time at Red Lobster for lunch.

222
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
To our tribal breakfast cereals.

223
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Total. Kellogg's Just Right.

224
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040
Both high nutrition cereals.

225
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,040
So what might make one better than the other?

226
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
Just Right has vitamin B1.

227
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
We have vitamin B1.

228
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
Just Right has vitamin B2.

229
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,040
B2. Just Right has iron.

230
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
Oh, we have iron.

231
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
Just Right has vitamin E.

232
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Oh, plenty of E.

233
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
Just Right has vitamin B6.

234
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,040
B6 here.

235
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
Just Right has almonds.

236
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,040
Just Right has sweet dates.

237
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
Plump raisins plus four different tasty grains.

238
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Just Right has two out of three people

239
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
preferring our taste.

240
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Which means Just Right is just better.

241
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,040
Kellogg's Just Right.

242
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
It's the taste that makes it just better.

243
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
The Mureen earwax removal system

244
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
has drops that safely loosen hard

245
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
and wax when used as directed.

246
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,040
Plus an ear washer to gently flush wax away.

247
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Mureen.

248
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
The complete medically approved system

249
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
to safely remove earwax.

250
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:14,040
The temperature is well below zero this morning.

251
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,040
Perfect to test Chevy's heartbeat.

252
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,040
With the electrical system fully taxed,

253
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,040
Chevy delivers reliable cold starting.

254
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,040
After thousands of tests,

255
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,040
an incredible 99.9% success record.

256
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,040
With 84 models redesigned and engineered,

257
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,040
GM is putting quality on the road.

258
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Every day, 22 million people come into McDonald's.

259
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,040
They count on the same hot, fresh food

260
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
at every McDonald's all over the world.

261
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,040
But imagine if there were only one McDonald's,

262
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,040
you could count on.

263
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,040
And 22 million people came in at the same time.

264
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
The whole restaurant would fill up.

265
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
The city would fill up.

266
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
And all those people in one place

267
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,040
would cause the earth to tilt off its axis

268
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,040
and go spinning into space.

269
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,040
And that would make a real mess of everything.

270
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
That's why we make every McDonald's

271
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
from Poughkeepsie to Pomona

272
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,040
just as good as every other McDonald's,

273
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,040
thereby saving the universe.

274
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,040
While the Daytona Shelby Turbo

275
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,040
may not be quite as plush as the Aston Martin,

276
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,040
and the power plant isn't quite like a Lamborghini,

277
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,040
its new VNT turbo makes it one of the most powerful

278
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
front-wheel sports cars built in America.

279
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,040
And while it doesn't quite reach the speed of a Testerosa,

280
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,040
at that speed, you might miss something.

281
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,040
The all-new Dodge Daytona Shelby Turbo,

282
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
the hot new spirit of Dodge.

283
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Now get up to $2,000 back at Dodge, guaranteed.

284
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
The bravest men.

285
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
Ain't no dream.

286
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,040
Are those with something to prove?

287
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,040
They gotta know that nobody's gonna let them fight.

288
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
And nothing to lose.

289
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,040
Someday they're gonna let the 54 get into us.

290
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
Matthew Broderick.

291
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,040
We'll be ready, sir.

292
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
Denzel Washington.

293
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
Come on!

294
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Kerry Ellways.

295
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
Ready!

296
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Morgan Freeman.

297
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Glory Redditor.

298
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,040
Now playing at a theater near you.

299
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
In DeMonte, Washington, when a kid's 18,

300
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
he's old enough to drive, old enough to vote,

301
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,040
and old enough to worry about something most adults have,

302
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,040
gingivitis, an early reversible gum disease

303
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
that left untreated could get serious.

304
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
Just ask your dentist.

305
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
Fortunately, many know enough to use Listerine,

306
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,040
the only non-prescription mouthwash accepted

307
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,040
by the American Dental Association

308
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,040
for helping to prevent and reduce plaque in gingivitis.

309
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,040
Yep, if you're old enough to worry about gum disease,

310
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,040
you ought to be smart enough to use Listerine.

311
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,040
I want to try something different.

312
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Can you make me look like that?

313
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Tuesday, it's a brand new job.

314
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Oh, I'm sure you can, Iris.

315
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
I'll go get the wand.

316
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
But she's the same old Roseanne.

317
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
Ben.

318
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,040
I'm not going to spend the rest of my life

319
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
spying some wire.

320
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
We all got chances, Elvis.

321
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
Some of them we just can't take.

322
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
In 1954, Vernon Presley wanted his son

323
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,040
to have a steady job with a secure future.

324
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,040
Well, I said, tell me, baby, what's wrong with you?

325
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,040
His dream came true, a special preview of Elvis Tuesday.

326
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,040
Sammy Davis Jr.'s 60th anniversary celebration

327
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,040
will continue in a moment.

328
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,040
You don't want, you don't get.

329
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
That's arithmetic.

330
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,040
Joe Kennedy.

331
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,040
He became the father of two senators and a president.

332
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,040
You were a very successful and wealthy man.

333
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
Isn't that winning?

334
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
No, not yet.

335
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
We had an appetite for power.

336
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,040
For the first Irish Catholic ambassador to England.

337
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
Wealth and women.

338
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,040
I never made history with anyone I've made love with.

339
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,040
How soon will you be home?

340
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,040
If there's any dirty work to be done, I'll be the one to do it.

341
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
The Kennedys of Massachusetts.

342
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Two weeks from tonight.

343
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,040
To the eye, the Lexus LS-400

344
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,040
looks like an elegantly contoured luxury sedan.

345
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,040
To the wind, however.

346
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,040
It doesn't look like much.

347
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
The Lexus LS-400,

348
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,040
the most aerodynamic luxury sedan in America.

349
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,040
The Lexus LS-400 says absolutely no cholesterol.

350
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Now what could be better than sunshine?

351
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Have a little sunshine.

352
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Have a little sunshine.

353
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,040
Have a little sunshine.

354
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,040
Pentagon Waste reaches the billions on 7 at 11.

355
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
The producers of the show,

356
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,040
the producers of the show was hoping you'd have a little more feeling,

357
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,040
a little more Mike Tyson.

358
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,040
A little more Mike Tysonisms.

359
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

360
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,040
Sammy and I would like...

361
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,040
To be continued...

362
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
It was Uchi.

363
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,040
Look, a little pale.

364
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Maybe he needs a doctor or something.

365
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,040
Maybe I do.

366
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
What happened?

367
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,040
They hate on me.

368
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,040
You have to drive it to believe it.

369
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
The New Accord.

370
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,040
This is delicious, Danny.

371
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,040
What do you call it?

372
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,040
It's new ragu fresh Italian pasta sauce.

373
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
So delicate.

374
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,040
What's it called?

375
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Fresh Italian pasta sauce.

376
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
Yeah, it's really fresh.

377
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
But what's the name of this?

378
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,040
See, ragu uses less heavy tomato paste

379
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
and twice the crushed tomatoes.

380
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
It's a very fresh tomato paste.

381
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
And twice the crushed tomatoes.

382
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,040
But what's the name of the sauce?

383
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,040
New ragu fresh Italian pasta sauce.

384
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,040
More crushed tomatoes, more fresh tomato taste.

385
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Here's a jar.

386
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
Look, it has the name on it.

387
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,040
Forget it.

388
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,040
They instantly turn on.

389
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
You put that show lead on,

390
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
and that spark is right there.

391
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
That's the difference between a good dog and a great dog.

392
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,040
These are champions. They deserve the best.

393
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
And I recommend pedigree and pedigree meal time.

394
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Pedigree.

395
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,040
Recommended by top breeders.

396
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,040
And now there's a new kind of pedigree.

397
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
Pedigree choice cuts.

398
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Tender juicy meaty chunks with the sauce

399
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
dogs can't resist.

400
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
One look tells you it's choice.

401
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
One feeding shows you it's irresistible.

402
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,040
New pedigree choice cuts.

403
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Recommended by top breeders.

404
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,040
My poor brother Tom,

405
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
every time he tried to see what he was missing,

406
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,040
he would miss what he was seeing.

407
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
Then Tom got this amazing Magnavox TV.

408
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
That lets him watch one show

409
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,040
while he checks out all the others

410
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,040
on this remarkable little window.

411
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,040
Hey, that's a smart window, Dick.

412
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,040
That's what they call it, Tom.

413
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,040
They call it Tom?

414
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,040
No, no, no. They call it smart window, Tom.

415
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
I don't know. I kind of like Tom.

416
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Magnavox. Smart choice.

417
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,040
Very smart.

418
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Friday.

419
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,040
I am now officially a teenager.

420
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
It's DJ's first kiss.

421
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
30 candles

422
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
to an all-new full house.

423
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,040
I'm the team.

424
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Followed by a new Family Matters Friday.

425
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,040
Christ on New Yorker 5th Avenue.

426
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
If the rebate goes up,

427
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,040
Chrysler will pay you the difference.

428
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
I think I'm in love.

429
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Who now?

430
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
That goddess.

431
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
I'm the rap.

432
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
Out of your league.

433
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Oh, yeah?

434
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
Yeah.

435
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Yeah.

436
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Watch and learn.

437
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,040
May I have a towel?

438
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Richard?

439
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Never underestimate the doctor.

440
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Hi, excuse me, y'all. Are you French?

441
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,040
You look French. I love French food.

442
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,040
This morning, I was following a Sears service truck

443
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
when it dawned on me.

444
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,040
I see Sears trucks all the time.

445
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,040
It also dawned on me that I hardly ever see a service truck

446
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
from those so-called superstores.

447
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,040
So before you make that next big buying decision,

448
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,040
ask yourself what kind of service you'll get five years from now,

449
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,040
or if they'll even be around to answer the phone.

450
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,040
That's one of the big reasons I feel better

451
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,040
when I buy a major appliance or electronics from Sears.

452
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,040
And that's what they mean by your money's worth

453
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,040
and a whole lot more.

454
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,040
They've been selected because of their visions, their dreams,

455
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,040
and the roles they want to play as leaders in America's future.

456
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,040
And someday they may truly have a place in black history.

457
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,040
Bitesize Ritz-Bitz Peanut Butter Sandwiches

458
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,040
The taste of Ritz-Bitz and real peanut butter in tiny sandwiches

459
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
with no assembly required.

460
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Bitesize Ritz-Bitz Peanut Butter Sandwiches

461
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,040
The taste of Ritz-Bitz and real peanut butter in tiny sandwiches

462
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,040
with no assembly required.

463
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,040
Hey, wait for me!

464
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Monday!

465
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
Stop raping the forest!

466
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,040
MacGyver goes out on a limb to save the trees.

467
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,040
I don't know what to do.

468
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,040
I don't know what to do.

469
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,040
I don't know what to do.

470
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,040
MacGyver goes out on a limb to save the trees.

471
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,040
I can handle it.

472
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,040
MacGyver, then, based on a true story.

473
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Daddy, you're alive!

474
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
The father who refused to let his family die.

475
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,040
Mayday, mating. Two children stranded.

476
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,040
Robert Conrad, anything to survive, Monday.

477
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,040
I'm using this other long-distance company.

478
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Try to call Phoenix. I miss style Fiji.

479
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
Pull him and knock him inside!

480
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,040
I call the operator. She says she can't give me instant credit.

481
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,040
I say AT&T always did.

482
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,040
She says, you're not dealing with AT&T.

483
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,040
If you miss dealing with AT&T, it's easier than ever to come back.

484
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:05,040
Just call 1-800-582-1700 right now and we'll switch you back for free.

485
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,040
They kept saying how much money I'd save.

486
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Then I get the first bill.

487
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,040
I'm not kidding. I thought it was a typo.

488
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
I mean, where were the big savings?

489
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,040
People who thought they could do better than AT&T are coming back for the real value.

490
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:22,040
You can't do it simple. Just call now and come back for free.

491
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,040
It takes longer getting through, but I'm saving a ton, right? Wrong.

492
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
You gotta read the fine print.

493
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,040
Pull him and knock him inside!

494
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
I couldn't believe it.

495
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
You're not dealing with AT&T.

496
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
Well, I am now.

497
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:38,040
1-800-582-1700 for dependable crystal clear AT&T long-distance service.

498
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,040
Call now and we'll switch you for free.

499
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,040
You couldn't pick a better time to come back.

500
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,040
If you want an anti-lock braking system like Mercedes,

501
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:50,040
a driver airbag like BMW,

502
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,040
a rear load-leveling suspension feature similar to Rolls,

503
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,040
and a more advanced transmission than Jaguar,

504
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,040
this is a simple way to get it all.

505
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:06,040
Introducing the all-new Chrysler Imperial.

506
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,040
There is no luxury without engineering.

507
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,040
The guaranteed rebate has been extended until February 28th.

508
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,040
Get $1,000 now.

509
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:22,040
There's only one thing I used to hate worse than having to wash out my pantyhose every night.

510
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,040
And that was having to throw him out.

511
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,040
Pantyhose that lasts are no nonsense.

512
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,040
Ladies and gentlemen, Dennis Miller.

513
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,040
I just knew they'd call.

514
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,040
It's almost as if someone once said,

515
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
just in case people like sunshine and water,

516
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
we'd better make Florida.

517
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
And we'd better make miles of beautiful beaches

518
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,040
and places like St. Augustine and Key West,

519
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,040
just in case people want to go to them.

520
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,040
There are over 4 million miles of roads in Alamo territory,

521
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
all across America.

522
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,040
And nationwide, only Alamo gives you all those miles for free,

523
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:13,040
including the ones that run through a state that's named after sunshine.

524
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Knowing how to read and write can really make you feel wanted.

525
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Help someone learn to read.

526
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,040
Volunteer as a tutor in your community.

527
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
Tuesday.

528
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Hi.

529
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Hi.

530
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
I've missed you.

531
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
You're married.

532
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
It's a second chance for love.

533
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
What are we doing?

534
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,040
I can't do this.

535
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
I wish that you didn't have to go.

536
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
I'm in love with you.

537
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
30-something Tuesday.

538
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,040
The day may come when every freestanding range

539
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,040
will have a smooth, sealed-in surface that's easy to clean

540
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
and heats up this fast.

541
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,040
But Whirlpool has it today.

542
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,040
Hey, Mike, I really like this white sinfin' doll.

543
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,040
Well, good, good.

544
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
Now put it down.

545
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,040
We're going to try another one.

546
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
He loves to do this.

547
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
This one's great.

548
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Yeah, I like it better.

549
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
Why?

550
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Can't it just taste better?

551
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
Isn't that loud?

552
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
Did you know Gallo made a white sinfin' doll?

553
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
No, it's terrific, isn't it?

554
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,040
Am I going to get any credit for this?

555
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
Oh, yeah.

556
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:23,040
Ernest and Julio Gallo present a very special white sinfin' doll.

557
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,040
It will change the way you think about Gallo.

558
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
Wednesday.

559
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
The war is over.

560
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
It's the moment they've all been waiting for.

561
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Forget your troubles.

562
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Come on, get happy.

563
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
But is it really the end?

564
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
Don't you believe it?

565
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
When the wheels of my freedom bird lift off,

566
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,040
I'll believe it.

567
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,040
China Beach.

568
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Alpha Beta shoppers are finding

569
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,040
when the new sign went up,

570
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
the prices came down.

571
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
For the last year I shopped at Alpha Beta,

572
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
and now that it's switched over to Lucky's,

573
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:55,040
I find a significant reduction in my weekly grocery bill.

574
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,040
It's important that I have quality and affordable prices,

575
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,040
and I find that I get both of that

576
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,040
when I shop at Lucky's.

577
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,040
Alpha Beta is now Lucky.

578
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,040
We think you'll like the change.

579
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
I want a ten minute breakfast,

580
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,040
so I'm bringing a clock to time.

581
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
You don't need a clock.

582
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,040
The waitress has a stopwatch.

583
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,040
If her watch is stopped,

584
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,040
how will I know when ten minutes are up?

585
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,040
Because if breakfast takes longer than ten minutes, it's free.

586
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
I get a broken watch for free?

587
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
I'm talking about breakfast.

588
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
And you've rambled on long enough.

589
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
It's time to go eat at Lenny's.

590
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
Denny's.

591
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,040
Denny's.

592
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,040
Now you can have your breakfast or lunch served in ten minutes,

593
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
or it's free, only at Denny's.

594
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,040
It's where individuals become a family.

595
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:53,040
It's where they share memories and news and opinions.

596
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
It's where parents get to know their children

597
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
and their children's children.

598
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Homes will always be an important part of people's lives.

599
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,040
That's why home loans are such a secure investment.

600
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,040
And that's where Home Savings of America

601
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,040
has put its depositors' money for more than a hundred years.

602
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Juice.

603
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
Quiet, please.

604
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,040
Oh no, I'm not here.

605
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
When allergies come on this strong,

606
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Benadryl comes on stronger.

607
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,040
A change is coming, it's understood.

608
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,040
Happening all over my neighborhood.

609
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,040
Only one place got the taste for me.

610
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,040
Gonna change the pizza hut delivery.

611
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,040

619
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,040
Gonna change the pizza hut delivery.

620
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Pizza Hut Delivery, Bacon and Grape.

621
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,040
It's here.

622
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,040
Trying is believing week,

623
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,040
and here's how people who are trying breakfast with grape nuts feel.

624
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
You've got to try it.

625
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,040
I did, and I feel great.

626
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,040
It's a great natural energy source, and it's fat-free.

627
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,040
You won't believe how good you feel.

628
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,040
I do.

629
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,040
I feel great.

630
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Grape nuts cereal is full of complex carbohydrates.

631
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
You won't believe how it helps keep you going all morning.

632
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,040
Look for this display in your store.

633
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,040
Post-grape nuts trying is believing week.

634
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
You've got to do it.

635
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
Um, excuse me.

636
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:47,040
In a blind test, women compared new advanced formula

637
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
Agree shampoo to an expensive salon brand,

638
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,040
Red Can Amino Pond.

639
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Guess which one they like better?

640
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,040
Agree. It's that good.

641
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Aren't Ritz and Ritz-Bitz really the same?

642
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,040
Well, that's a silly question.

643
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
One's bigger, one's little.

644
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
So they're different.

645
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
But they're still the same.

646
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
So they're the same.

647
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,040
Don't you get it?

648
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Ritz or Ritz-Bitz, two sizes fits all.

649
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
Wednesday.

650
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,040
I took buster to the vet.

651
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
And?

652
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Honey, is there something wrong with him?

653
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,040
Well, nothing.

654
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,040
He can't be fixed.

655
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
You'll get sympathy pains on the Wonder Years.

656
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Then?

657
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
You're playing.

658
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
A special episode.

659
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Nobody makes blueberry pancakes like you do, Margaret.

660
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Oh, those aren't blueberry pancakes.

661
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
Share memories of grandpa.

662
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,040
On Growing Pains, Wednesday.

663
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,040
To be the one company big enough and innovative enough

664
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
to offer plans where you never have to fill out

665
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,040
one single claim form.

666
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
Blue Cross of California.

667
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,040
We make the system work for you.

668
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:12,040
While the competition only offers a three-year warranty plan,

669
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,040
TaylorMade Office Systems offers an exclusive five-year warranty

670
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
plan on their Canon NP copiers

671
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,040
with all of the guarantees in writing.

672
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Remember that the next time your copier company feeds you,

673
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:28,040
the same old line.

674
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
And more overall passenger space.

675
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,040
Stop having fun.

676
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
It doesn't add up.

677
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
The Isuzu Rodeo.

678
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
True, it doesn't add up.

679
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Isuzu, there's no comparison.

680
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,040
Now, with factor-to-dealer incentives,

681
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
air conditioning comes standard with any 4x2 Rodeo

682
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,040
for a limited time.

683
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
Lots of men have heard about Monoxadil.

684
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,040
And lots of men have heard about Rogaine.

685
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,040
But lots of men don't know that only Rogaine has Monoxadil.

686
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,040
And only your doctor can prescribe Rogaine.

687
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,040
For more information, call this number now.

688
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,040
If you're wondering where the Rogaine is for you,

689
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,040
call this number.

690
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
And we'll give you an incentive to find out.

691
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:28,040
A certificate worth $10 toward a consultation visit with your doctor.

692
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,040
Call 1-800-556-4800.

693
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:50,040
Some men would rather live their lives sheltered in the harbor.

694
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,040
And some would rather sail into life

695
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:56,040
with the unmistakable scent of Old Spice.

696
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,040
Clean, true, and classic, Old Spice.

697
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,040
One of the legends of the sea.

698
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,040
What are you sitting here doing?

699
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,040
Excuse me.

700
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Aren't you glad you used dials?

701
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,040
To the airport. Let's go.

702
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Are we over the window here?

703
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
Don't you wish everybody did?

704
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,040
Right, Rogaine.

705
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Are you going to handle for this window?

706
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,040
So I start watching the Discovery Channel.

707
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,040
Thought maybe I'll learn something.

708
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,040
Then I see they have this guide, you know,

709
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,040
to kind of help you figure out when everything's on.

710
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,040
So I order it. Real easy.

711
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Just 1-800-TDC-8343.

712
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,040
And I charge it.

713
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
And now a few weeks later, it's here.

714
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
I mean, look at this thing.

715
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,040
It's a magazine.

716
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,040
T-D-C Magazine.

717
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
I open it up.

718
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
And there's this grid,

719
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,040
which is great because I can see the whole week at a glance.

720
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
I just circle the shows I want to see.

721
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
And look at this.

722
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,040
It's a complete description of every single show.

723
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,040
And check this out.

724
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,040
These photographs. Gorgeous.

725
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,040
There's even articles by famous authors.

726
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
Amazing.

727
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,040
All I expected was a program guide,

728
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,040
and I get all this.

729
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
What a bargain.

730
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,040
I wonder if they'll ever be a swimsuit issue.

731
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,040
Call now to order your T-D-C Magazine

732
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,040

733
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,040

734
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,040
Or tell the operator to bill you later.

735
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,040
These and MasterCard accepted.

736
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,040
It's never one food that gives you what you need.

737
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
It's the combination and the balance.

738
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
And how you balance the combinations.

739
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,040
So at McDonald's, there's lots to choose from.

740
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,040
Lean burgers to low-fat shakes and frozen yogurt.

741
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,040
Salads.

742
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
No fat.

743
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
No cholesterol.

744
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,040
Apple brand muffins.

745
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,040
And cholesterol free oil for our chicken, potatoes, and fish.

746
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,040
We've got a long list of good foods to choose from.

747
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,040
All you've got to do is just choose the food for you.

748
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,040
Always good food.

749
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,040
Always good value at McDonald's.

750
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,040
It can be downright frustrating

751
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,040
and difficult to get perfect orange juice.

752
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,040
One with that pure fresh squeeze taste

753
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,040
with no water added or taken away.

754
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,040
But if you remember that no other major brand of juice

755
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
comes closer to this,

756
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,040
than this Tropicana Pure Premium,

757
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,040
you'll think you'll find everything will just fall into place.

758
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
Tropicana Pure Premium.

759
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,040
Also appearing in 96 ounces.

760
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,040
Call me irresponsible.

761
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,040
Just because the other guy is on the road

762
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,040
doesn't mean his mind is.

763
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,040
So the superb traction of the Subaru Legacy

764
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,040
with four-wheel drive and anti-lock brakes

765
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
can be quite a comfort.

766
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,040
Since the next guy is capable of almost anything,

767
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,040
shouldn't the same be true of your next car?

768
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,040
Factory to dealer cash could mean great savings to you

769
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,040
during the Subaru Spring Value Days.

770
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,040
Three hours, nine minutes.

771
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
May I ask what you're doing?

772
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
Timing tiny time pills.

773
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,040
Excuse me?

774
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
Well, this morning when I woke up, I talked like this,

775
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,040
and I didn't like that.

776
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
So I took a contact.

777
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,040
So, well, contact has 600 tiny time pills at last 12 hours.

778
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,040
Up to three times longer than ordinary cold medicine.

779
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,040
There's a whole day's work in every contact.

780
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
Eight hours and 30 seconds.

781
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,040
Look, if you're going to time the tiny time pills all day,

782
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,040
when are you going to do the work?

783
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,040
Right.

784
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,040
You time.

785
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,040
There's a whole day's work in every contact.

786
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,040
Coming to ABC.

787
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,040
I'll give you three and a half in time served.

788
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,040
No way. Two years tops.

789
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
Three. Two and a half.

790
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
Three or no deal.

791
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
Done.

792
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,040
You know something's wrong and you still want to try this case?

793
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,040
You said you took it on the cases nobody else wanted.

794
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,040
How the hell are we supposed to win a case without witnesses?

795
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,040
They'll deny it.

796
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,040
Oh, your honor, we got a big problem here.

797
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,040
Treat Williams.

798
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,040
You mean you're a real lawyer?

799
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,040
Surprise.

800
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:48,040
Eddie Dodd, premiering this week on ABC TV.

801
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,040
Announcing something you've never seen before

802
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,040
in an inexpensive Macintosh.

803
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,040
Color.

804
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,040
Lifetime.

805
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,040
No wonder many of us seem to always make bell calling card.

806
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,040
You can easily charge calls wherever you are,

807
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,040
whether you're just down the street or somewhere up the coast.

808
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:16,040
But unlike most calling cards, Pacific Bells is based on your own familiar phone number.

809
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,040
And since it's welcome at most every phone,

810
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,040
it's really the only calling card you need to hang on to.

811
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,040
Pacific Bell, we're making things easier everywhere.

812
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,040
McDonald's explodes another myth.

813
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,040
If it's no fat, it can't be delicious.

814
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,040
Not so.

815
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,040
Introducing McLean Deluxe, made with a 91% fat free beef patty.

816
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,040
Low fat and delicious.

817
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,040
Can't be done.

818
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
Can too.

819
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:49,040
You wanted great burger taste with a lot less fat.

820
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,040
Only McDonald's responded.

821
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
New McLean Deluxe will blow you away.

822
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
It's terrific.

823
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
It can't be low fat.

824
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,040
It's both New McLean Deluxe after billions and billions.

825
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,040
Another first at McDonald's today.

826
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,040
Johnson's Baby Oil.

827
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,040
For skin soft as the day you were born.

828
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,040
See this displayed for colors you can love.

829
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,040
I love where you're not fade away.

830
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,040
Bigoters lurk in small places.

831
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
Stick it to them, the snick ups.

832
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,040
Bigoters linger in small places.

833
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,040
Stick it to them, the snick ups.

834
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,040
Airwick has big news, a new decorative design and a great new scent.

835
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,040
Popery sashay.

836
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,040
Stick it to them.

837
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,040
My friend Carol is so different from me.

838
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,040
She does lunchables all at once.

839
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,040
I do it one by one.

840
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,040
We're total opposites.

841
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,040
But we've been best friends forever.

842
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,040
Oscar Meyer Lunchables lunch combinations.

843
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
Because lunch is what you make of it.

844
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,040
McDonald's explodes another myth.

845
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,040
If it's low fat, it can't be delicious.

846
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,040
Not so.

847
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,040
Introducing McLean Deluxe.

848

Low fat and delicious.

850
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,040
Can't be done.

851
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,040
Can too.

852
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,040

Another first at McDonald's today.

859

Make me, make me your baby.

860
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:18,040
Touch me, touch me and maybe you will see.

861
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:24,040
How baby soft you can be.

862
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:28,040

I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be.

866
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:43,040
Are you gonna give your love to me?

867
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,040
I wanna love you night and day.

868
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,040
You know my love and I fade away.

869
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,040

Bigoters lurk in small places.

874
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,040
Stick it to up the snick ups.

875
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,040
Bigoters linger in small places.

876
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,040
Stick it to up the snick ups.

877
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,040
Airwick has big news.

878

A new decorative design and a great new scent.

879
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,040
Popories as she is.

880
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,040
Stick it to up.

881
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,040
My friend Carol is so different from me.

882
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,040

Poor Sam and Samantha.

889
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,040
So young and yet so glum.

890
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
Changing time was just no fun.

891
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,040
But old mother Goose waved her wing

892
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
and put all the magic of story time

893
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,040
into new Huggies diapers.

894
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,040
Just the thing.

895
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,040
Nursery Rhymes.

896
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,040
Learning Rhymes.

897
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,040
Playful pictures too.

898
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,040
Eleven designs in every package.

899
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,040
Now Sam and Samantha are full of glee

900
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,040
in new story time Huggies.

901
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,040
And changing time is happy as can be.

902
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,040
You may have noticed lately

903
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,040
that lots of people are having considerable trouble

904
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,040
walking and chewing gum at the same time.

905
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,040
Perhaps it's because of the great taste of Trident.

906
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,040
Original fruit and bubble.

907
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,040
Trident. Good for your teeth.

908
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,040
And great taste too.

909
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,040
But I told him.

910
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,040
Well look, maybe the guy wasn't listening.

911
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,040
Oh, here it comes.

912
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,040
When allergies come on this strong,

913
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,040
Benadryl comes on stronger.

914
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,040
Oh boy, you know, Roger,

915
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,040
I haven't seen anything this nasty since Rosie.

916
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,040
What do you want?

917
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,040
A monkey.

918
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,040
It's gonna be a belly-wagger.

919
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,040
Wow, good night.

920
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,040
Turn up the light.

921
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,040
Uh-oh.

922
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,040
Little Caesars.

923
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,040
Cheezer-Cheezer.

924
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,040
Not one, but two pizzas loaded with cheese

925
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,040
and up to five toppings for $8.98.

926
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,040
Cheezer-Cheezer.

927
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,040
Bravely, Fred has faced one too many healthy

928
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,040
but boring breakfast.

929
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,040
Enough!

930
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:12,040
I want taste, indulgence.

931
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,040
Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats.

932
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,040
A friend.

933
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,040
Ooh, naughty frosting.

934
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,040
Freddy, Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats

935
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,040
are good for you, there's fiber.

936
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,040
No.

937
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,040
And no salt.

938
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,040
But they taste so good.

939
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,040
And they're fat-free, see?

940
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,040
Fat-free?

941
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,040
Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats.

942
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,040
Surprise, they're good for you.

943
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,040
You see it your way?

944
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,040
I see it mine.

945
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,040
We're all going to Italy Tuesday

946
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,040
when Tony and Harrods are vineyard.

947
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,040
Greetings, fellow villagers.

948
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,040
He's welcomed with Christ's freedom.

949
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,040
Who's the boss?

950
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,040
And at a special time,

951
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,040
net-baity guest stars.

952
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,040
That's a chemistry set.

953
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,040
Every boy should have one.

954
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,040
No, you shouldn't have done that, Ed.

955
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,040
We could just turn on the gas and blow ourselves up.

956
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,040
An hour on Roseanne and...

957
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,040
I flew here this morning from Colombia.

958
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,040
A dope smuggler swallows his stage.

959
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,040
If somebody dies, it's not your fault, is it?

960
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,040
No, not totally.

961
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,040
What percentage would you say?

962
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,040
Stat Tuesday.

963
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,040
Johnson's brings out the baby soft shine

964
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,040
born in your hair.

965
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,040
Double fresh, double good.

966
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,040
Come on and double it.

967
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,040
Double meat, double meat.

968
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,040
Gone.

969
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,040
There's no single come light.

970
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,040
It's not so easy to grow beans, you know.

971
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,040
You have to water them,

972
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,040
pull up the weeds,

973
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,040
and tie them up so they can reach the sun.

974
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,040
Then your mother has to help you build a fence

975
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,040
to keep the bunnies out.

976
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,040
Then you have to pick them carefully.

977
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:25,040
After that, you get to eat them.

978
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,040
And if you're lucky,

979
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,040
your mother will make a ride of golden twirls

980
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,040
to go with them.

981
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,040
Golden twirls are very delicious

982
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,040
and so much fun.

983
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,040
I wonder how they grow these.

984
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,040
The average driver puts 12 to 13,000 miles a year on a car.

985
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,040
At Saturn, we knew this.

986
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,040
Where and how, though, is anyone's guess.

987
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,040
For sure, we knew people would be taking

988
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,040
to new Saturn places.

989
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,040
And using it in ways you'd never figure.

990
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,040
Or even imagine.

991
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,040
So we tested it.

992
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,040
We ran at 6 million miles.

993
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,040
Everywhere.

994
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,040
Sometimes, nowhere.

995
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,040
Wednesday, Kevin's got a big problem

996
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:12,040
with Paul's little sister.

997
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,040
I'm not taking your sister to the catillion.

998
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,040
I mean, you're gonna have to tell her.

999
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,040
Unpleasant as it might be.

1000
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,040
It was time to break a heart.

1001
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,040
Would you go with me?

1002
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,040
The wonder years.

1003
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,040
It's European holiday and Mike's getting a head start.

1004
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,040
Party! Party!

1005
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,040
It's a tale of two vacations.

1006
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,040
Happy anniversary.

1007
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,040
I'm stranded in Spain with a crazy woman.

1008
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,040
Catch all the fun Wednesday.

1009
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,040
With great burger taste and a lot less fat.

1010
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,040
But don't fill up on the press.

1011
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,040
Taste for yourself.

1012
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,040
One bite and you'll be talking about it, too.

1013
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,040
The Swallow First.

1014
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,040
New Maclean Deluxe.

1015
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,040
After billions and billions.

1016
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,040
Another first at McDonald's today.

1017
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,040
Bradley decided to express his artistic talent

1018
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,040
on the living room wall.

1019
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,040
A little more covered in one coat.

1020
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,040
They're so cute at that age.

1021
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,040
You can't get mad at them.

1022
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:20,040
Wanna bet?

1023
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,040
Are you sure you have everything?

1024
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,040
Yeah.

1025
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,040
Turn around.

1026
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,040
Hmm.

1027
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,040
I got the Fuji film while you were in cosmetics.

1028
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,040
I didn't forget.

1029
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,040
Oh.

1030
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,040
You forgot you married the perfect husband.

1031
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,040
You were right, Dad.

1032
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,040
Kmart's pretty cool.

1033
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,040
You should listen to me more often.

1034
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,040
Of all pine cleaners, more people choose pine saw.

1035
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,040
Pine saw's got more active ingredients

1036
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,040
than the next leading brand.

1037
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,040
And pine saw disinfects better.

1038
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:50,040
It even kills staff germs.

1039
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,040
It's not really clean until...

1040
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,040
It's pine-solved.

1041
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,040
Friday on Full House, Joey and Jesse get close to nature.

1042
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,040
Woo-hoo!

1043
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,040
Mr. Fox!

1044
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,040
Maybe even a little too close.

1045
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,040
Ooh-la-la!

1046
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,040
It's time for a boy to become a man.

1047
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,040
Your mother sent out 150 invitations

1048
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,040
and we got 10 tons of potato salad downstairs.

1049
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,040
Rejoice!

1050
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,040
Robbie comes of age on his howling day.

1051
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,040
And all new dinosaurs ride up to Full House Friday.

1052
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,040
This one for me?

1053
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,040
Is this your kid?

1054
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,040
And is he drinking the only juice drink

1055
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,040
with a full day's vitamin C, four other vitamins,

1056
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,040
and all natural flavors?

1057
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,040
Well, maybe this isn't your kid.

1058
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,040
But this should be your kid.

1059
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,040
This is your kid.

1060
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,040
This is your kid.

1061
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,040
This is your kid.

1062
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,040
This is your kid.

1063
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,040
This is your kid.

1064
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,040
This is your kid.

1065
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,040
This is your kid.

1066
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,040
This is your kid.

1067
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,040
This is your kid.

1068
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,040
This is your kid.

1069
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,040
This is your kid.

1070
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,040
This is your kid.

1071
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,040
This is your kid.

1072
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,040
This is your kid.

1073
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,040
This is your kid.

1074
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,040
This is your kid.

1075
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,040
This is your kid.

1076
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,040
This is your kid.

1077
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:21,040
This is your kid.

1078
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,040
This is your kid.

1079
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,040
This is your kid.

1080
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,040
This is your kid.

1081
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,040
This is your kid.

1082
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,040
This is your kid.

1083
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,040
This is your kid.

1084
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,040
This is your kid.

1085
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,040
This is your kid.

1086
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,040

00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,160
It was cheaper.

1267
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,160
I saved a few cents.

1268
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,160
Mom, it's not the cheesiest.

1269
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,160
What's the difference?

1270
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,160
No, no, no.

1271
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,160
Sam, come on, pal.

1272
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,160
Dinner.

1273
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:07,160
Mom, you never serve anything but Kraft cheese and macaroni, right?

1274
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,160
I wouldn't dream of it.

1275
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,160
Kids love Kraft cheese and macaroni, and that's worth every penny.

1276
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:17,160
Kraft macaroni and cheese and new dinosaur and teddy bear shapes, too.

1277
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:18,160
Tuesday.

1278
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,160
Ugh, you're going to hate L.A.

1279
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,160
I will.

1280
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,160
Melissa's got a job on a sitcom.

1281
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,160
Do you have a real feel for the show?

1282
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,160
Loves the star.

1283
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,160
It's a pressure cooker.

1284
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,160
It really is.

1285
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,160
Loves the writer.

1286
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,160
Something about you.

1287
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,160
Hates the business.

1288
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,160
Who do you want us to contact?

1289
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,160
Excuse me.

1290
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,160
Who represents you?

1291
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,160
I do.

1292
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,160
30-something Tuesday.

1293
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:14,160
You're not leaving until you eat breakfast, so you might as well do it.

1294
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:17,160
If we've told you once, we've told you a thousand times.

1295
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,160
Have you forgotten everything we taught you?

1296
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:25,160
A suggestion for all you grown-ups who think there's no time for a hot breakfast.

1297
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,160
Kellogg's Pop Tarts.

1298
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,160
They will fruit.

1299
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,160
You like fruit, don't you?

1300
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,160
An open wide.

1301
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,160
Kellogg's Pop Tarts.

1302
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,160
A hot breakfast everyone has time for.

1303
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:40,160
You know you like it.

1304
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,160
I'm Kate Kelly in New Orleans.

1305
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:51,160
Coming up tonight on Nightcast, the power of voodoo could have determined the outcome of Sunday Super Bowl.

1306
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:54,160
And are the 49ers superstitious?

1307
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:59,160
I have a little ritual I go through before the game and try to get myself as nervous as possible.

1308
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:03,160
I'm just going to stay out of the small towns and stay away from the people working the voodoo.

1309
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:05,160
Voodoo at the Super Bowl.

1310
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:13,160
Live coverage from New Orleans continues tonight on Nightcast.

1311
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:20,160
For years, we've been telling you how the four-wheel drive Subaru helps the U.S. ski team get to their events early.

1312
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:26,160
Yet at the 1989 World Championships, the U.S. team was not the first to arrive.

1313
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:32,160
The Norwegians beat us, the French beat us, as did the Italians and the Swedes.

1314
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,160
How'd they do it?

1315
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:42,160
That was the year we lent them all a Subaru.

1316
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:47,160
Imagine a Disneyland as big as the city of San Francisco.

1317
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:51,160
A Disney world with a surprise around every corner.

1318
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,160
43 square miles of tropical paradise.

1319
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:02,160
The spectacular new Disney MGM Studios theme park and the incredible Epcot Center.

1320
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:13,160
Imagine yourself here, Walt Disney World in Florida, as big as imagination gets.

1321
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:17,160
Beauty and the Beast will continue.

1322
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:22,160
You never know where history will unfold, but you always know where to turn.

1323
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:27,160
The CBS Even News with Dan Rather. You always know when it's CBS News.

1324
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,160
Gary's being pushed too far.

1325
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,160
If you love me, you must leave me alone.

1326
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:33,160
His worst nightmare is taking shape.

1327
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:36,160
My children are going to be living under the same roof as a rapist.

1328
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,160
His last resort, an act of desperation.

1329
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,160
Speak now or else forever holds your peace.

1330
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:44,160
I'm going to yell rapist or rapist.

1331
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:48,160
I'm not slanting. Thursday.

1332
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,160
This is CBS.

1333
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:56,160
It's the biggest party in the history of Disneyland.

1334
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:02,160
Disneyland's year-long 35th anniversary celebration with the biggest parade we've ever staged.

1335
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:05,160
Towering four stories over Main Street.

1336
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:11,160
Our biggest giveaway ever. A new GEO every day and over 400,000 other prizes.

1337
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:16,160
Plan now for your biggest vacation ever. Disneyland's 35th anniversary.

1338
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,160
Party, party, Disneyland's big.

1339
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,160
It's Disneyland's big.

1340
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,160
You know where it's at.

1341
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:49,160
At your Northern California Mazda dealer now.

1342
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,160
There are very few guarantees in medicine.

1343
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:02,160
But if you have arthritis pain like I do, you should know about Mediprin and the Mediprin guarantee.

1344
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,160
If two Mediprin don't relieve minor arthritis pain better than two regular aspirin, you get your money back.

1345
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,160
Strong promise?

1346
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,160
Strong medicine.

1347
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,160
The medicine that concentrates the power of ibuprofen into these potent little caplets.

1348
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,160
The medicine that guarantees better relief than regular aspirin.

1349
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,160
Better arthritis pain relief. That's the Mediprin guarantee.

1350
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,160
They know they want to win. They look at the judge and they ask for it.

1351
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,160
The show dog begins with what you feed it.

1352
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:30,160
I mix the pedigree with the pedigree meal time because the dogs enjoy it.

1353
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,160
It's the perfect combination.

1354
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,160
These are champions. They deserve the best.

1355
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:37,160
Pedigree. Recommended by top breeders.

1356
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:43,160
Right now you're just 90 seconds away from Chef Boyardee with microwave meals.

1357
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:47,160
Chef Boyardee pasta hot and tasty and with no messy cleanup.

1358
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,160
Chef Boyardee microwave meals.

1359
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:52,160
Thank goodness in just 90 seconds.

1360
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:56,160
This morning I was following a Sears service truck when it dawned on me.

1361
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,160
I see Sears trucks all the time.

1362
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:03,160
It also dawned on me that I hardly ever see a service truck from those so-called superstores.

1363
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:06,160
So before you make that next big buying decision,

1364
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,160
ask yourself what kind of service you'll get five years from now

1365
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:12,160
or if they'll even be around to answer the phone.

1366
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:17,160
That's one of the big reasons I feel better when I buy a major appliance or electronics from Sears.

1367
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:21,160
And that's what they mean by your money's worth and a whole lot more.

1368
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,160
This looks like something my mom would eat.

1369
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:29,160
It's kind of quiet, conservative.

1370
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,160
I don't think I can get into this.

1371
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:34,160
I mean, it's just a bunch of flakes.

1372
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,160
Hmm.

1373
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,160
It doesn't taste the way it looks.

1374
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,160
I like the way it crunches.

1375
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,160
Maybe it's good because it's simple.

1376
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,160
Wait, wait. Don't tell me. I'm just like my mother.

1377
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,160
Kellogg's Corn Flakes.

1378
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,160
Corn Flakes?

1379
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:52,160
Taste them again for the first time.

1380
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,160
I hope you'll be with us tonight.

1381
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,160
Dan Miller will be live from New Orleans inside the Super Bowl

1382
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,160
bringing you updates on goodness knows what

1383
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,160
along with actress Karen Black and much more.

1384
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,160
See you later tonight.

1385
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,160
One, two, three.

1386
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:07,160
On tour with Paul McCartney.

1387
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,160
There is life after Beatles.

1388
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:13,160
A special edition of 48 Hours Thursday.

1389
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:17,160
Sammy Davis Jr. 60th Anniversary Celebration

1390
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,160
Brought to you by

1391
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,160
Dr. Pepper and your local Dr. Pepper bottler.

1392
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,160
Dr. Pepper is just what the doctor ordered.

1393
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:29,160
The good time, great taste of McDonald's.

1394
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:33,160
AT&T, the right choice.

1395
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,160
And Chrysler Corporation and the Chrysler Motorist

1396
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,160
Black Dealers Association.

1397
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:43,160
What do you like about your Eagle Premier?

1398
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,160
Everything.

1399
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,160
You mean the leather interior and the roominess?

1400
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,160
I said everything.

1401
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,160
So what's Premier got that other cars in his class don't they?

1402
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,160
Me.

1403
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,160
You test drove the Maxima?

1404
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,160
You got it.

1405
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,160
The Taurus and the Cressida?

1406
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,160
You got it.

1407
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:00,160
Then you tried the Eagle Premier?

1408
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,160
You got it.

1409
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,160
What'd you think?

1410
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,160
I got it.

1411
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,160
All the phone cords that bind,

1412
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,160
that hold your small business back.

1413
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:21,160
Now AT&T can set you free with the first cordless phone

1414
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,160
specifically designed for business.

1415
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,160
The multi-line Merlin cordless.

1416
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:28,160
It works with AT&T's small business phone systems

1417
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:32,160
so you don't have to lose any quality to gain your freedom.

1418
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,160
Set your business free.

1419
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:40,160
Call 1-800-MERLIN-ATT for the new Merlin cordless.

1420
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:44,160
Who's weather?

1421
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,160
Kate.

1422
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,160
Pitch a maroon as due up.

1423
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,160
Kate.

1424
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,160
So Burns is going to have to do his pinch.

1425
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,160
The only choice is John Kane.

1426
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,160
Hey, kid.

1427
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,160
Can't be the doc?

1428
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:55,160
Burns has been reluctant.

1429
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,160
It's Kane's friend to go with the younger players,

1430
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,160
but he may not have a choice here tonight.

1431
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,160
Now batting from around.

1432
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,160
Kane.

1433
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,160
I got into him.

1434
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,160
This is Hubert Strohls.

1435
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:18,160
Austrian downhill racer and Olympic gold medalist.

1436
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,160
He's not afraid of extreme vertical drops.

1437
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:25,160
He's not afraid of speeds over 90 miles an hour.

1438
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:29,160
He's not afraid of anything except going slow.

1439
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,160
But if you think he's tough,

1440
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:32,160
wait till you see the guys at the ticket window

1441
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,160
at the Olympics if you don't have your Visa card

1442
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:39,160
because the Olympics don't take American Express.

1443
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:42,160
Asa, it's every way you want to be.

1444
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,160
We really missed you, man.

1445
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,160
Really.

1446
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,160
You were left all night long.

1447
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,160
It was your kind of thing.

1448
01:09:49,160 --> 01:09:52,160
You made me laugh.

1449
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:54,160
It was so embarrassing.

1450
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,160
I haven't seen him in years.

1451
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,160
It was great.

1452
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:57,160
He still cracks me out.

1453
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,160
I'll tell you one more time because I think I liked it.

1454
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,160
I just did that.

1455
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:02,160
We just did that, yeah.

1456
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:06,160
No one helps you share the feelings like AT&T long distance.

1457
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,160
I wish you could have been here, too.

1458
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:12,160
AT&T, all you need to reach out.

1459
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:15,160
I love chasing quarterbacks.

1460
01:10:17,160 --> 01:10:19,160
When you've got the style of Hanes socks,

1461
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:22,160
who wants to run around and cleats?

1462
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:28,160
Hanes, nothing else feels so right.

1463
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,160
Like to try total?

1464
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,160
Mom says grape nuts.

1465
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,160
Hope you're hungry.

1466
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,160
It takes four bowls of grape nuts

1467
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:35,160
to get the vitamins in one bowl of total.

1468
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,160
Total has 100% of a day's supply

1469
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,160
of 12 vitamins and minerals.

1470
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,160
You tell her.

1471
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:44,160
Total, one bowl, 100%.

1472
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:47,160
Red Lobster announces great new trios.

1473
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,160
Six delicious trios you're going to love.

1474
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:50,160
Terrific.

1475
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,160
Like our large butterfly shrimp.

1476
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,160
Lobster alfredo and scallops.

1477
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,160
Love it.

1478
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:56,160
Or our crab legs.

1479
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,160
Juicy scallops and shrimp.

1480
01:10:58,160 --> 01:10:59,160
Let's go.

1481
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:03,160
But hurry, our great new trios won't last long.

1482
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:07,160
Red Lobster for the secret lover.

1483
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,160
Try the trio with the unbeatable price.

1484
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:11,160
Our Atlantic trio, just $6.99.

1485
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,160
$6.99?

1486
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,160
That's incredible.

1487
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,160
On One Life to Live, the start of a love affair.

1488
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,160
This is going to be a good trip.

1489
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,160
Or the beginning of the end.

1490
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,160
Oh.

1491
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,160
It's an attraction that could be fatal.

1492
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,160
You're perfectly safe in the boat.

1493
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,160
Trust me.

1494
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,160
You'll never forget the incident at Loom Lake

1495
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,160
on One Life to Live.

1496
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:32,160
Ford trucks.

1497
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,160
The best.

1498
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,160
Never a rest.

1499
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,160
The first vehicle Henry Ford sold was not a car.

1500
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,160
It was a truck.

1501
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:42,160
Our full-size pickups were first with rear anti-lock brakes.

1502
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:45,160
First with electronic overdrive transmission.

1503
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:47,160
First with push-button four-wheel drive.

1504
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,160
Now what does all this get you?

1505
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:50,160
It gets you number one.

1506
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:54,160
And if you keep doing it, you stay number one.

1507
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:56,160
More people are driving the best-built,

1508
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:59,160
best-selling American trucks than ever before.

1509
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,160
Fresh in breath and taste great.

1510
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,160
People who use plain-calamine lotions to relieve itches

1511
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:20,160
or poison ivy are easy to spot.

1512
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,160
But new-caladrial clear not only works better to stop the itch,

1513
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,160
it dries this clear.

1514
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:28,160
So nobody will ever spot you.

1515
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,160
New-caladrial clear.

1516
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,160
One man unwilling to forgive.

1517
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:35,160
You break the law, it'll come running back to me.

1518
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,160
The other unable to forget.

1519
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,160
I swore an oath to my country,

1520
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,160
not to what was going on over there.

1521
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:45,160
Charlton Heston, Peter Strauss, Proud Men, Saturday.

1522
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,160
China Beach will continue in a moment.

1523
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:56,160
Can life come from lava?

1524
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:58,160
Tomorrow on Good Morning America,

1525
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:01,160
how a lava field blossoms into one of nature's miracles.

1526
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,160
Then meet Vi Warshawski.

1527
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:05,160
Kathleen Turner turns private eye in her new role.

1528
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:08,160
We'll bomb back here on Good Morning America tomorrow.

1529
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:14,160
You know, the Channel 7 newsroom is not unlike the community in which we live.

1530
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,160
We are an eclectic mix.

1531
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,160
Everyone comes from different backgrounds.

1532
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,160
We are a boisterous, diversified group.

1533
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:25,160
Everyone has their own ideas in the newsroom about how they think the day should go.

1534
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:29,160
We tend to have loud laughs and loud debates.

1535
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:32,160
I think the newsroom is a microcosm of the community.

1536
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:35,160
We're really a cross-section of the Bay Area.

1537
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:47,160
In a formal life, Sandy can be seen walking in the park,

1538
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,160
wearing stirrup pants and stretch denim.

1539
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:55,160
A deep, purple waterproof parka with an attic fleece lining.

1540
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,160
And a black rubber backpack.

1541
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:06,160
A line and a climb.

1542
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:15,160
Jodie, who lives on Russian Hill, is talking to her brother Peter, who lives in Eureka.

1543
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:21,160
Remarkably, this call costs 25% less than last month,

1544
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,160
because Peter is in Jodie's bonus zone,

1545
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:27,160
and Jodie just got call bonus from Pacific Bell.

1546
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:30,160
Wherever you live in California, call us.

1547
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:34,160
We'll check and see if call bonus can save you money too.

1548
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:37,160
For 1-800-PAC-BELL, we're making things easier.

1549
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:42,160
Another wimpy sandwich.

1550
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:45,160
Not me. I've got vintage farms deli loafing.

1551
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,160
It's got real sliced meat chunks.

1552
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:51,160
Still going, nothing outlasts the energizer.

1553
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:55,160
They keep going and going and go.

1554
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:05,160
A better way to catch your zizz is on Sealy's new posturepedic sleep system,

1555
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,160
designed to conform to your shape,

1556
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:11,160
distribute your weight evenly, comfortably.

1557
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:13,160
Only Sealy posturepedic has it,

1558
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:17,160
so for a better night's sleep, better sleep on a Sealy.

1559
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:21,160
Someone finally made oatmeal the way I like it.

1560
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:23,160
He doesn't like oatmeal.

1561
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:26,160
Oatmeal crisp is big, crispy flakes with oatmeal.

1562
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:29,160
Little brown sugar, lots of crunchy almonds.

1563
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,160
Don't you lie to your mother.

1564
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,160
Look Ma, I'm eating my oatmeal.

1565
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:36,160
Look Ma, I'm eating my oatmeal.

1566
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,160
Oatmeal crisp, oatmeal raisin crisp.

1567
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,160
Look Ma, I found something for nothing.

1568
01:15:40,160 --> 01:15:45,160
Pop secret popcorn, free and specially marked boxes of oatmeal crisp and oatmeal raisin crisp.

1569
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,160
Be sure and write them a nice email.

1570
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,160
I'll see you next time.

1571
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,160
Please, thank you Lord.

1572
01:15:56,160 --> 01:16:00,160
Now there's a new reason to put down those fizzy diet colas.

1573
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,160
It's crystal light in a new shade.

1574
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,160
Pink grapefruit.

1575
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:09,160
Light and luscious with no carbonation.

1576
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,160
Okay, sit down.

1577
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:14,160
Ring side seats.

1578
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:16,160
250 bucks.

1579
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,160
This is gonna be great.

1580
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:22,160
These days a good value is hard to come by.

1581
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:26,160
Unless you come by KFC for the amazing double bucket deal.

1582
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:32,160
For a limited time get a 10 piece bucket of chicken for 8 bucks and the seconds just 4 bucks.

1583
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,160
Repeat 4 bucks.

1584
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:38,160
The double bucket deal only from KFC.

1585
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:46,160
He was rock's first and only king.

1586
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:50,160
He had the fame, the cash, the women.

1587
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:53,160
And he had the pills, the pains.

1588
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:56,160
One woman saw it all, lived it all.

1589
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:59,160
This is her remarkable story.

1590
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:06,160
Priscilla Presley's devastating account of life and death in the eye of the storm.

1591
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:10,160
Elvis and me, Sunday.

1592
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:18,160
Here is a group of people who were going along doing what they do better than they'd ever done it before.

1593
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,160
And someone came along and pulled the rug out.

1594
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:22,160
It was a struggle for survival.

1595
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:25,160
Peter Jennings reporting from the heart of Harlem Thursday.

1596
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,160
Only 99 cents each.

1597
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,160
McDonald's today.

1598
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:57,160
The breakfast burrito only 99 cents each at McDonald's today.

1599
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:06,160
The Pepsi Summit Chill Out gives us permission to let our hair down.

1600
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:11,160
What is it? Chill out?

1601
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,160
I don't know, but what else am I gonna do this summer?

1602
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:18,160
It's games, promotions, fun, and free costs.

1603
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,160
It's like Woodstock Man.

1604
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:23,160
People in tight pants moving fast.

1605
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:31,160
For my family, Tartar Control Aquafresh fights Tartar.

1606
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,160
Who makes you feel this fresh?

1607
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:36,160
Tartar Control Aquafresh helps remove plaque.

1608
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:38,160
Who makes you feel this fresh?

1609
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:40,160
Tartar Control Aquafresh fights cavities.

1610

And makes you feel this fresh.

1611
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:51,160
Only Tartar Control Aquafresh is the fresh way to fight cavities, fight plaque, and fight tartar, all with one great aquafresh taste.

1612
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:53,160
Tartar Control Aquafresh.

1613
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,160
It fights tartar.

1614
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:57,160
And makes you feel this fresh.

1615
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:03,160
I've got great news for everyone who uses bleach to clean up the kitchen and bath.

1616
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:07,160
New Clorox Cleanup is a bleach, specially designed for cleaning.

1617
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:11,160
You see, Clorox added a special cleaner to bleach, so it cleans even better.

1618
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:18,160
Now you can clean up stains, clean up germs, and clean up greasy dirt bleach alone leaves behind.

1619
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:23,160
So, when you reach for a bleach to clean up, reach for the one with a special cleaner inside.

1620
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,160
New Clorox Cleanup.

1621
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,160
Cleans like bleach, only better.

1622

Coming to ABC this fall.

1623

The war is over.

1624
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:36,160
A celebration has begun.

1625
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:45,160
Boys have returned as men to open arms, to laughter, and to love.

1626
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:50,160
Sir, the whole time I was over there, all I thought about was you.

1627
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:52,160
How am I going to tell them?

1628
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,160
Is she seeing someone else?

1629
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,160
Is she what?

1630
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,160
These are their stories of triumph.

1631
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:00,160
This is an impressive record, soldier.

1632
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,160
And despair.

1633
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,160
They can't pay you less than other men on the line.

1634
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,160
They can if I'm a janitor.

1635
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,160
Their hope for the future.

1636
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,160
Hank has been fighting a war, not dating.

1637
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,160
Their dreams left behind.

1638
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,160
Americans are wonderful people.

1639
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:17,160
Linda, if you'd made an effort to pretty yourself up, you wouldn't have lost Mike to somebody.

1640
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:20,160
They became wartime heroes.

1641
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:23,160

San Francisco police tonight are investigating why it happened.

1648
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:57,160
A tour bus careened down a street and slammed into a childcare center in San Francisco.

1649
01:20:57,160 --> 01:21:00,160
The force was so tremendous, the bus smashed through the walls.

1650
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,160
No one was in the childcare center.

1651
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:04,160

See it on 7 at 11.

1657
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,160
Hey, listen to this.

1658
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:30,160
In a blind test, women like new advanced formula agree conditioner as much as a salon brand, Nexisumetris.

1659
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:33,160
So if one cost less, would you switch?

1660
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:36,160
Agree. It's that good.

1661
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,160
Tuesday.

1662
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,160
I was more wondering about sex.

1663
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,160
No reason not to have sex.

1664
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,160
Sex is definitely in the mind.

1665
01:21:45,160 --> 01:21:46,160
Sex.

1666
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:49,160

1668

01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,160
Yes, I'm ready.

1670
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,160
Get ready to feel softer.

1671
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:05,160
Never thought I could ever feel so good.

1672
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:09,160
Caress with its silky touch of bath oil leaves skin softer than soap can.

1673

Never felt so right on a show tonight.

1677
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,160
Before you dress, caress.

1678
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:27,160
I won't wear anything without Cross Your Heart.

1679
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:30,160
Because great looks start with Cross Your Heart.

1680
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,160
With crisscross shaping, I always look better.

1681
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,160
The Cross Your Heart bra.

1682
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:36,160

The fit that makes the fashion.

1685
01:22:53,160 --> 01:23:02,160
Hey, thanks man. Stay cool.

1686
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,160

Let me show you how the educated consumer can tell the difference between my deli meat

1689
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,160
and Oscar Maya deli thin slices.

1690
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:21,160
Now you can't go by looks or taste on a con of their both sliced fresh, real thin.

1691
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:25,160
But my deli meat comes in this beautiful white paper.

1692
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:27,160
See how nice you can write?

1693
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:30,160
But Oscar Maya comes in this resealable bag.

1694
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,160
You can't write nothing.

1695
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:35,160
Presenting Oscar Maya deli thin slices.

1696
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:40,160
Deli fresh taste without the deli.

1697
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:45,160
Can you believe it when some margarine say buttery taste and there's no butter in them?

1698
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:49,160
Craft touch of butter spread has rich creamy butter in it.

1699
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,160
Just a touch.

1700
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:52,160
Craft touch of butter.

1701
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:55,160
A touch of real butter makes a real difference.

1702
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,160
