WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
We need more fog that leaves us with an escape.

00:02.480 --> 00:05.840
We need more fog that leaves us with an paradise.

00:05.840 --> 00:12.180
I spend all my time working in thisくるくる of a gym for a whole week.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.380
We need more fog like this.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.540
We need more fog like this.

00:14.540 --> 00:16.420
We need more fog like this.

00:16.420 --> 00:19.200
We need more fog, not even 10 million pounds.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.420
Our parking space is big and kayak今路が mile them.

00:22.420 --> 00:25.120
What about bed Seong-dol?

00:27.120 --> 00:29.000
I'm not going to make it.

00:29.000 --> 00:38.000
Mr. McDonald, let's talk chicken.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.040
Are you aware that the public prefers the taste of Kentucky nuggets to your chicken

00:42.040 --> 00:45.160
muck nuggets by almost three to one?

00:45.160 --> 00:46.160
No sir.

00:46.160 --> 00:50.280
And is your muck chicken sandwich made with the Colonel's secret blend of eleven herbs

00:50.280 --> 00:51.280
and spices?

00:51.280 --> 00:52.280
No sir.

00:52.280 --> 00:54.640
So how do you expect to sell chicken?

00:54.640 --> 00:55.640
Toys!

00:55.640 --> 00:58.040
Lots of toys!

00:58.040 --> 00:59.040
It's our best.

00:59.040 --> 01:02.800
A dollar ninety-nine for the Colonel's chicken sandwich and fries, or Kentucky nuggets and

01:02.800 --> 01:04.300
fries.

01:04.300 --> 01:06.960
Comes a time in every guy's life when, well, things begin to change.

01:06.960 --> 01:08.960
You know what I'm talking about, fellas?

01:08.960 --> 01:11.760
Suddenly wheels means cars instead of skateboards.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.400
Look, let's broaden your horizons.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.400
It's time to move on.

01:14.400 --> 01:18.040
Instead of always reaching for that same old bag of potato chips, why not tear into a bag

01:18.040 --> 01:20.360
a nacho cheese Doritos tortilla chips?

01:20.360 --> 01:21.360
Bigger taste!

01:21.360 --> 01:22.360
Bigger crunch!

01:22.360 --> 01:24.480
Here's a snack chip that bites back.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.200
Come on.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.440
Nacho cheese Doritos.

01:27.440 --> 01:28.440
Come in now.

01:28.440 --> 01:29.440
You can handle that.

01:29.440 --> 01:30.440
Come on.

01:30.440 --> 01:32.440
Punch all you want.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.440
We'll make more.

01:33.440 --> 01:34.440
Dave.

01:34.440 --> 01:35.440
Dave.

01:35.440 --> 01:40.080
If you make a grilled chicken sandwich at Wendy's, they will come.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.080
They will?

01:41.080 --> 01:44.840
If you make it with a chicken breast, they will come.

01:44.840 --> 01:45.840
It has to be boneless.

01:45.840 --> 01:49.360
If you make it with lettuce and tomato.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.360
And honey mustard.

01:50.360 --> 01:54.760
And put it all together on a toasted bomb, they will come.

01:54.760 --> 01:57.640
Call it Wendy's Grilled Chicken Sandwich.

01:57.640 --> 02:00.320
Dave, I told you they will come.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.320
It's Wendy.

02:01.320 --> 02:04.320
I just can't figure out how she's doing it.

02:04.320 --> 02:08.760
For fun around here, me and the boys liked to do something a little bit crazy.

02:08.760 --> 02:10.840
Put two kinds of cheese on a cheeseburger.

02:10.840 --> 02:16.000
For a while, new taste headed the store for two kinds of cheese and lean ground beef.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Cheddar and monster.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Crazy.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.440
Things do go bump in the night.

02:24.440 --> 02:28.160
There are boogeymen.

02:28.160 --> 02:33.600
Fortunately, Silly's exclusive post-hypothetic sleep system is designed to support everyone

02:33.600 --> 02:38.440
differently.

02:38.440 --> 02:44.440
More comfortably to keep your night from becoming your worst nightmare.

02:44.440 --> 02:50.040
For a better night's sleep, better sleep on a Silly.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.040
Wednesday.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.040
This isn't just about sex.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.040
No, no, why not?

02:54.040 --> 02:57.040
There's a little about sex though, isn't it?

02:57.040 --> 02:59.040
It's sort of nice on the phone.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.040
It's a portable upbringing with me.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.040
Things are really heating up.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.040
Anything but love after Tuggy Hussein.

03:05.040 --> 03:10.040
When Reggie and I agreed to meet for breakfast, I didn't think I needed to say where.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.040
It could only be one place.

03:12.040 --> 03:16.040
Where else can you get this delicious bacon egg and cheese biscuit?

03:16.040 --> 03:18.040
So much for him.

03:23.040 --> 03:45.040
Nice move, Jack.

03:45.040 --> 03:50.040
The Prelude SI with four-wheel steering from Honda.

03:51.040 --> 03:54.040
Grandpa, you think you could have a party every time you come out with a new product?

03:54.040 --> 03:55.040
This is really nice.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.040
You don't have a party like this every night.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.040
This is big.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.040
This is really big.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.040
This new light microwave popcorn.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.040
With one-third fewer calories and two-thirds less fat.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.040
Then our regular microwave.

04:05.040 --> 04:08.040
And it pops up more than any other light microwave.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.040
It's going to keep my figure just like it is today.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.040
Well, you're pretty good-looking, Grandpa, you know.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.040
That's what Grandma says, too.

04:14.040 --> 04:15.040
Yeah.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.040
Not all of us can be as good-looking as you, Grandpa.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.040
Well, that's true.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.040
That's true.

04:47.040 --> 04:54.040
Now, at Little Caesars, you can get Picnic Picnic.

04:54.040 --> 04:57.040

04:57.040 --> 05:03.040

05:03.040 --> 05:05.040
It's Picnic Picnic.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.040
Two pizzas, two orders of crazy bread,

05:07.040 --> 05:14.040
and two servings of Coke Classic, all for only $7.98.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.040
It's Picnic Picnic.

05:17.040 --> 05:20.040

05:20.040 --> 05:23.040

05:26.040 --> 05:28.040
Picnic Picnic only at Little Caesars.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.040
Pizza, pizza.

05:31.040 --> 05:39.040
Why are beers that go down lightly watered down so heavily?

05:39.040 --> 05:40.040
Why?

05:40.040 --> 05:41.040
Ask.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.040
Why?

05:43.040 --> 05:47.040
Turn off the water and turn but dry.

05:47.040 --> 05:52.040
Its smooth draft taste is dry-brood, not watered down.

05:52.040 --> 05:56.040
To drink light, yet satisfied completely.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.040
So why get soaked?

05:58.040 --> 06:01.040
When you can drink but dry.

06:01.040 --> 06:03.040
A baby changes everything.

06:03.040 --> 06:07.040
Safety takes on a whole new meaning when it's somebody you love in that car.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.040
This is our family.

06:09.040 --> 06:14.040
They're the most technically advanced and life-like dummies in the world.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.040
Only GM uses a family like this to develop safety technology

06:17.040 --> 06:21.040
because we know quality cars, safe cars, should help protect everyone.

06:21.040 --> 06:25.040
I look at my family and I want us to be thinking of everything.

06:25.040 --> 06:29.040
GM's safety, it's not one thing, it's everything.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.040
She's everything to me.

06:32.040 --> 06:39.040
Dorothy, you marry me or is my ring a lifesaver?

06:39.040 --> 06:40.040
It's a beginning.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.040
Don't worry.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.040
I'll give it to my mother.

06:43.040 --> 06:47.040
Lifesavers candy isn't life delicious.

New snack size.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.040
And now, today's weather.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.040
Cold winds out of the north-northwest.

08:01.040 --> 08:04.040
With a 30% chance of snow tonight.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.040
Temperature dropping into low 20.

08:11.040 --> 08:14.040
At last, a weather-proof formula that holds longer

08:14.040 --> 08:17.040
and stronger than the other leading pumps.

08:50.040 --> 08:53.040
This is what American Airlines does better

08:53.040 --> 08:55.040
than anyone else.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.040
Arrive on time.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.040
Again and again.

09:01.040 --> 09:04.040
In fact, American has had the best on-time arrival record

09:04.040 --> 09:06.040
of the nine largest domestic airlines

09:06.040 --> 09:09.040
for as long as records have been kept.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.040
American Airlines.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.040
The on-time machine.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.040
It was a big day when the new equipment arrived.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.040
It's big.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.040
The biggest one I've ever seen.

09:25.040 --> 09:28.040
Of course, being a custom job, some assembly was required.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.040
It'll be a few weeks, people.

09:30.040 --> 09:33.040
But finally, it was ready.

On 7 at 11.

09:53.040 --> 09:57.040
So your woman's body is merely a frame.

09:57.040 --> 10:03.040
Homicides were created to release.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.040
Pants are mandatory.

10:06.040 --> 10:11.040

10:11.040 --> 10:13.040
Perfume and infusion.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.040
The short skirt is dead.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.040
My designs...

10:17.040 --> 10:20.040
No matter what the gentleman prefers,

10:20.040 --> 10:23.040
the lady prefers hands.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.040

11:31.040 --> 11:32.040
We have vitamin B1.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.040

11:33.040 --> 11:34.040
B2. Just Right has iron.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.040
Oh, we have iron.

11:35.040 --> 11:36.040
Just Right has vitamin E.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.040
Oh, plenty of E.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.040

Kellogg's Just Right.

It's the taste that makes it just better.

Plus an ear washer to gently flush wax away.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.040
Mureen.

12:03.040 --> 12:05.040
The complete medically approved system

12:05.040 --> 12:07.040
to safely remove earwax.

12:08.040 --> 12:14.040
The temperature is well below zero this morning.

12:14.040 --> 12:19.040
Perfect to test Chevy's heartbeat.

12:19.040 --> 12:24.040
With the electrical system fully taxed,

12:24.040 --> 12:27.040
Chevy delivers reliable cold starting.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.040
After thousands of tests,

12:29.040 --> 12:32.040
an incredible 99.9% success record.

12:32.040 --> 12:35.040
With 84 models redesigned and engineered,

12:35.040 --> 12:38.040
GM is putting quality on the road.

12:54.040 --> 12:58.040
Every day, 22 million people come into McDonald's.

12:58.040 --> 13:01.040
They count on the same hot, fresh food

13:01.040 --> 13:03.040
at every McDonald's all over the world.

13:03.040 --> 13:06.040
But imagine if there were only one McDonald's,

13:06.040 --> 13:08.040
you could count on.

13:08.040 --> 13:13.040
And 22 million people came in at the same time.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.040
The whole restaurant would fill up.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.040
The city would fill up.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.040
And all those people in one place

13:23.040 --> 13:26.040
would cause the earth to tilt off its axis

13:26.040 --> 13:28.040
and go spinning into space.

13:34.040 --> 13:38.040
And that would make a real mess of everything.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.040
That's why we make every McDonald's

13:43.040 --> 13:45.040
from Poughkeepsie to Pomona

13:45.040 --> 13:48.040
just as good as every other McDonald's,

13:48.040 --> 13:50.040
thereby saving the universe.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.040
While the Daytona Shelby Turbo

13:54.040 --> 13:57.040
may not be quite as plush as the Aston Martin,

13:57.040 --> 14:00.040
and the power plant isn't quite like a Lamborghini,

14:00.040 --> 14:03.040
its new VNT turbo makes it one of the most powerful

14:03.040 --> 14:05.040
front-wheel sports cars built in America.

14:05.040 --> 14:08.040
And while it doesn't quite reach the speed of a Testerosa,

14:08.040 --> 14:11.040
at that speed, you might miss something.

14:11.040 --> 14:14.040
The all-new Dodge Daytona Shelby Turbo,

14:14.040 --> 14:16.040
the hot new spirit of Dodge.

14:16.040 --> 14:20.040
Now get up to $2,000 back at Dodge, guaranteed.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.040
The bravest men.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.040
Ain't no dream.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.040
Are those with something to prove?

14:32.040 --> 14:34.040
They gotta know that nobody's gonna let them fight.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.040
And nothing to lose.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.040
Someday they're gonna let the 54 get into us.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.040
Matthew Broderick.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.040
We'll be ready, sir.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.040
Denzel Washington.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.040
Come on!

14:43.040 --> 14:44.040
Kerry Ellways.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.040
Ready!

14:45.040 --> 14:47.040
Morgan Freeman.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.040
Glory Redditor.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.040
Now playing at a theater near you.

14:55.040 --> 14:57.040
In DeMonte, Washington, when a kid's 18,

14:57.040 --> 14:59.040
he's old enough to drive, old enough to vote,

14:59.040 --> 15:02.040
and old enough to worry about something most adults have,

15:02.040 --> 15:05.040
gingivitis, an early reversible gum disease

15:05.040 --> 15:07.040
that left untreated could get serious.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.040
Just ask your dentist.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.040
Fortunately, many know enough to use Listerine,

15:11.040 --> 15:13.040
the only non-prescription mouthwash accepted

15:13.040 --> 15:15.040
by the American Dental Association

15:15.040 --> 15:18.040
for helping to prevent and reduce plaque in gingivitis.

15:18.040 --> 15:21.040
Yep, if you're old enough to worry about gum disease,

15:21.040 --> 15:24.040
you ought to be smart enough to use Listerine.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.040
I want to try something different.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.040
Can you make me look like that?

15:28.040 --> 15:30.040
Tuesday, it's a brand new job.

15:30.040 --> 15:32.040
Oh, I'm sure you can, Iris.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.040
I'll go get the wand.

15:33.040 --> 15:35.040
But she's the same old Roseanne.

15:35.040 --> 15:36.040
Ben.

15:36.040 --> 15:38.040
I'm not going to spend the rest of my life

15:38.040 --> 15:39.040
spying some wire.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.040
We all got chances, Elvis.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.040
Some of them we just can't take.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.040
In 1954, Vernon Presley wanted his son

15:45.040 --> 15:48.040
to have a steady job with a secure future.

15:48.040 --> 15:51.040
Well, I said, tell me, baby, what's wrong with you?

15:51.040 --> 15:55.040
His dream came true, a special preview of Elvis Tuesday.

15:55.040 --> 15:58.040
Sammy Davis Jr.'s 60th anniversary celebration

15:58.040 --> 16:00.040
will continue in a moment.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.040
You don't want, you don't get.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.040
That's arithmetic.

16:02.040 --> 16:03.040
Joe Kennedy.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.040
He became the father of two senators and a president.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.040
You were a very successful and wealthy man.

16:08.040 --> 16:09.040
Isn't that winning?

16:09.040 --> 16:11.040
No, not yet.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.040
We had an appetite for power.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.040
For the first Irish Catholic ambassador to England.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.040
Wealth and women.

16:19.040 --> 16:22.040
I never made history with anyone I've made love with.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.040
How soon will you be home?

16:24.040 --> 16:27.040
If there's any dirty work to be done, I'll be the one to do it.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.040
The Kennedys of Massachusetts.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.040
Two weeks from tonight.

16:34.040 --> 16:37.040
To the eye, the Lexus LS-400

16:37.040 --> 16:40.040
looks like an elegantly contoured luxury sedan.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.040
To the wind, however.

16:51.040 --> 16:54.040
It doesn't look like much.

16:54.040 --> 16:56.040
The Lexus LS-400,

16:56.040 --> 16:59.040
the most aerodynamic luxury sedan in America.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.040
The Lexus LS-400 says absolutely no cholesterol.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.040
Now what could be better than sunshine?

17:25.040 --> 17:27.040
Have a little sunshine.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.040
Have a little sunshine.

17:29.040 --> 17:32.040
Have a little sunshine.

17:32.040 --> 17:36.040
Pentagon Waste reaches the billions on 7 at 11.

17:40.040 --> 17:42.040
The producers of the show,

17:42.040 --> 17:45.040
the producers of the show was hoping you'd have a little more feeling,

17:45.040 --> 17:48.040
a little more Mike Tyson.

17:48.040 --> 17:50.040
A little more Mike Tysonisms.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.040
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.040
Sammy and I would like...

17:54.040 --> 17:57.040
To be continued...

18:16.040 --> 18:18.040
It was Uchi.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.040
Look, a little pale.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.040
Maybe he needs a doctor or something.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.040
Maybe I do.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.040
What happened?

18:30.040 --> 18:32.040
They hate on me.

18:52.040 --> 18:54.040
You have to drive it to believe it.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.040
The New Accord.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.040
This is delicious, Danny.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.040
What do you call it?

19:02.040 --> 19:04.040
It's new ragu fresh Italian pasta sauce.

19:04.040 --> 19:06.040
So delicate.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.040
What's it called?

19:08.040 --> 19:10.040
Fresh Italian pasta sauce.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.040
Yeah, it's really fresh.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.040
But what's the name of this?

19:14.040 --> 19:16.040
See, ragu uses less heavy tomato paste

19:16.040 --> 19:18.040
and twice the crushed tomatoes.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.040
It's a very fresh tomato paste.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.040
And twice the crushed tomatoes.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.040
But what's the name of the sauce?

19:24.040 --> 19:26.040
New ragu fresh Italian pasta sauce.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.040
More crushed tomatoes, more fresh tomato taste.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.040
Here's a jar.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.040
Look, it has the name on it.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.040
Forget it.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.040
They instantly turn on.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.040
You put that show lead on,

19:38.040 --> 19:40.040
and that spark is right there.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.040
That's the difference between a good dog and a great dog.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.040
These are champions. They deserve the best.

19:44.040 --> 19:46.040
And I recommend pedigree and pedigree meal time.

19:46.040 --> 19:48.040
Pedigree.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.040
Recommended by top breeders.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.040
And now there's a new kind of pedigree.

19:52.040 --> 19:54.040
Pedigree choice cuts.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.040
Tender juicy meaty chunks with the sauce

19:56.040 --> 19:58.040
dogs can't resist.

19:58.040 --> 20:00.040
One look tells you it's choice.

20:00.040 --> 20:02.040
One feeding shows you it's irresistible.

20:02.040 --> 20:04.040
New pedigree choice cuts.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.040
Recommended by top breeders.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.040
My poor brother Tom,

20:08.040 --> 20:10.040
every time he tried to see what he was missing,

20:10.040 --> 20:12.040
he would miss what he was seeing.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.040
Then Tom got this amazing Magnavox TV.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.040
That lets him watch one show

20:18.040 --> 20:20.040
while he checks out all the others

20:20.040 --> 20:22.040
on this remarkable little window.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.040
Hey, that's a smart window, Dick.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.040
That's what they call it, Tom.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.040
They call it Tom?

20:28.040 --> 20:30.040
No, no, no. They call it smart window, Tom.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.040
I don't know. I kind of like Tom.

20:32.040 --> 20:34.040
Magnavox. Smart choice.

20:34.040 --> 20:36.040
Very smart.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.040
Friday.

20:38.040 --> 20:40.040
I am now officially a teenager.

20:40.040 --> 20:42.040
It's DJ's first kiss.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.040
30 candles

20:44.040 --> 20:46.040
to an all-new full house.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.040
I'm the team.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.040
Followed by a new Family Matters Friday.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.040
Christ on New Yorker 5th Avenue.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.040
If the rebate goes up,

21:18.040 --> 21:20.040
Chrysler will pay you the difference.

21:22.040 --> 21:24.040
I think I'm in love.

21:24.040 --> 21:25.040
Who now?

21:25.040 --> 21:26.040
That goddess.

21:26.040 --> 21:27.040
I'm the rap.

21:27.040 --> 21:28.040
Out of your league.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.040
Oh, yeah?

21:29.040 --> 21:30.040
Yeah.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.040
Yeah.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.040
Watch and learn.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.040
May I have a towel?

21:42.040 --> 21:44.040
Richard?

21:44.040 --> 21:46.040
Never underestimate the doctor.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.040
Hi, excuse me, y'all. Are you French?

21:50.040 --> 21:52.040
You look French. I love French food.

21:52.040 --> 21:54.040
This morning, I was following a Sears service truck

21:54.040 --> 21:56.040
when it dawned on me.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.040
I see Sears trucks all the time.

21:58.040 --> 22:01.040
It also dawned on me that I hardly ever see a service truck

22:01.040 --> 22:03.040
from those so-called superstores.

22:03.040 --> 22:06.040
So before you make that next big buying decision,

22:06.040 --> 22:09.040
ask yourself what kind of service you'll get five years from now,

22:09.040 --> 22:11.040
or if they'll even be around to answer the phone.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.040
That's one of the big reasons I feel better

22:13.040 --> 22:16.040
when I buy a major appliance or electronics from Sears.

22:16.040 --> 22:19.040
And that's what they mean by your money's worth

22:19.040 --> 22:21.040
and a whole lot more.

22:41.040 --> 22:44.040
They've been selected because of their visions, their dreams,

22:44.040 --> 22:47.040
and the roles they want to play as leaders in America's future.

22:47.040 --> 22:51.040
And someday they may truly have a place in black history.

22:51.040 --> 22:54.040
Bitesize Ritz-Bitz Peanut Butter Sandwiches

22:54.040 --> 22:57.040
The taste of Ritz-Bitz and real peanut butter in tiny sandwiches

22:57.040 --> 22:59.040
with no assembly required.

22:59.040 --> 23:02.040
Bitesize Ritz-Bitz Peanut Butter Sandwiches

23:02.040 --> 23:06.040
The taste of Ritz-Bitz and real peanut butter in tiny sandwiches

23:06.040 --> 23:08.040
with no assembly required.

23:10.040 --> 23:12.040
Hey, wait for me!

23:13.040 --> 23:15.040
Monday!

23:15.040 --> 23:17.040
Stop raping the forest!

23:17.040 --> 23:20.040
MacGyver goes out on a limb to save the trees.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.040
I don't know what to do.

23:22.040 --> 23:24.040
I don't know what to do.

23:24.040 --> 23:26.040
I don't know what to do.

23:26.040 --> 23:29.040
MacGyver goes out on a limb to save the trees.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.040
I can handle it.

23:31.040 --> 23:34.040
MacGyver, then, based on a true story.

23:34.040 --> 23:35.040
Daddy, you're alive!

23:35.040 --> 23:37.040
The father who refused to let his family die.

23:37.040 --> 23:40.040
Mayday, mating. Two children stranded.

23:40.040 --> 23:43.040
Robert Conrad, anything to survive, Monday.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.040
I'm using this other long-distance company.

23:45.040 --> 23:47.040
Try to call Phoenix. I miss style Fiji.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.040
Pull him and knock him inside!

23:48.040 --> 23:51.040
I call the operator. She says she can't give me instant credit.

23:51.040 --> 23:53.040
I say AT&T always did.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.040
She says, you're not dealing with AT&T.

23:55.040 --> 23:59.040
If you miss dealing with AT&T, it's easier than ever to come back.

23:59.040 --> 24:05.040
Just call 1-800-582-1700 right now and we'll switch you back for free.

24:05.040 --> 24:07.040
They kept saying how much money I'd save.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.040
Then I get the first bill.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.040
I'm not kidding. I thought it was a typo.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.040
I mean, where were the big savings?

24:13.040 --> 24:17.040
People who thought they could do better than AT&T are coming back for the real value.

24:17.040 --> 24:22.040
You can't do it simple. Just call now and come back for free.

24:22.040 --> 24:26.040
It takes longer getting through, but I'm saving a ton, right? Wrong.

24:26.040 --> 24:27.040
You gotta read the fine print.

24:27.040 --> 24:28.040
Pull him and knock him inside!

24:28.040 --> 24:29.040
I couldn't believe it.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.040
You're not dealing with AT&T.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.040
Well, I am now.

24:32.040 --> 24:38.040
1-800-582-1700 for dependable crystal clear AT&T long-distance service.

24:38.040 --> 24:40.040
Call now and we'll switch you for free.

24:40.040 --> 24:43.040
You couldn't pick a better time to come back.

24:43.040 --> 24:47.040
If you want an anti-lock braking system like Mercedes,

24:47.040 --> 24:50.040
a driver airbag like BMW,

24:50.040 --> 24:54.040
a rear load-leveling suspension feature similar to Rolls,

24:54.040 --> 24:57.040
and a more advanced transmission than Jaguar,

24:57.040 --> 25:02.040
this is a simple way to get it all.

25:02.040 --> 25:06.040
Introducing the all-new Chrysler Imperial.

25:06.040 --> 25:09.040
There is no luxury without engineering.

25:09.040 --> 25:12.040
The guaranteed rebate has been extended until February 28th.

25:12.040 --> 25:14.040
Get $1,000 now.

25:15.040 --> 25:22.040
There's only one thing I used to hate worse than having to wash out my pantyhose every night.

25:22.040 --> 25:25.040
And that was having to throw him out.

25:25.040 --> 25:29.040
Pantyhose that lasts are no nonsense.

25:29.040 --> 25:33.040
Ladies and gentlemen, Dennis Miller.

25:38.040 --> 25:41.040
I just knew they'd call.

25:45.040 --> 25:48.040
It's almost as if someone once said,

25:48.040 --> 25:50.040
just in case people like sunshine and water,

25:50.040 --> 25:52.040
we'd better make Florida.

25:52.040 --> 25:54.040
And we'd better make miles of beautiful beaches

25:54.040 --> 25:57.040
and places like St. Augustine and Key West,

25:57.040 --> 25:59.040
just in case people want to go to them.

25:59.040 --> 26:03.040
There are over 4 million miles of roads in Alamo territory,

26:03.040 --> 26:04.040
all across America.

26:04.040 --> 26:08.040
And nationwide, only Alamo gives you all those miles for free,

26:08.040 --> 26:13.040
including the ones that run through a state that's named after sunshine.

26:15.040 --> 26:19.040
Knowing how to read and write can really make you feel wanted.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.040
Help someone learn to read.

26:21.040 --> 26:24.040
Volunteer as a tutor in your community.

26:25.040 --> 26:26.040
Tuesday.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.040
Hi.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.040
Hi.

26:28.040 --> 26:29.040
I've missed you.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.040
You're married.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.040
It's a second chance for love.

26:32.040 --> 26:33.040
What are we doing?

26:33.040 --> 26:34.040
I can't do this.

26:34.040 --> 26:36.040
I wish that you didn't have to go.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.040
I'm in love with you.

26:38.040 --> 26:40.040
30-something Tuesday.

26:41.040 --> 26:44.040
The day may come when every freestanding range

26:44.040 --> 26:47.040
will have a smooth, sealed-in surface that's easy to clean

26:47.040 --> 26:49.040
and heats up this fast.

26:49.040 --> 26:53.040
But Whirlpool has it today.

26:57.040 --> 26:59.040
Hey, Mike, I really like this white sinfin' doll.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.040
Well, good, good.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.040
Now put it down.

27:01.040 --> 27:02.040
We're going to try another one.

27:02.040 --> 27:04.040
He loves to do this.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.040
This one's great.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.040
Yeah, I like it better.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.040
Why?

27:08.040 --> 27:09.040
Can't it just taste better?

27:09.040 --> 27:11.040
Isn't that loud?

27:11.040 --> 27:13.040
Did you know Gallo made a white sinfin' doll?

27:13.040 --> 27:14.040
No, it's terrific, isn't it?

27:14.040 --> 27:16.040
Am I going to get any credit for this?

27:16.040 --> 27:18.040
Oh, yeah.

27:18.040 --> 27:23.040
Ernest and Julio Gallo present a very special white sinfin' doll.

27:23.040 --> 27:26.040
It will change the way you think about Gallo.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.040
Wednesday.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.040
The war is over.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.040
It's the moment they've all been waiting for.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.040
Forget your troubles.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.040
Come on, get happy.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.040
But is it really the end?

27:35.040 --> 27:36.040
Don't you believe it?

27:36.040 --> 27:38.040
When the wheels of my freedom bird lift off,

27:38.040 --> 27:39.040
I'll believe it.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.040
China Beach.

27:42.040 --> 27:44.040
Alpha Beta shoppers are finding

27:44.040 --> 27:45.040
when the new sign went up,

27:45.040 --> 27:47.040
the prices came down.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.040
For the last year I shopped at Alpha Beta,

27:49.040 --> 27:51.040
and now that it's switched over to Lucky's,

27:51.040 --> 27:55.040
I find a significant reduction in my weekly grocery bill.

27:55.040 --> 27:59.040
It's important that I have quality and affordable prices,

27:59.040 --> 28:01.040
and I find that I get both of that

28:01.040 --> 28:03.040
when I shop at Lucky's.

28:03.040 --> 28:06.040
Alpha Beta is now Lucky.

28:06.040 --> 28:08.040
We think you'll like the change.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.040
I want a ten minute breakfast,

28:15.040 --> 28:17.040
so I'm bringing a clock to time.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.040
You don't need a clock.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.040
The waitress has a stopwatch.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.040
If her watch is stopped,

28:20.040 --> 28:22.040
how will I know when ten minutes are up?

28:22.040 --> 28:25.040
Because if breakfast takes longer than ten minutes, it's free.

28:25.040 --> 28:27.040
I get a broken watch for free?

28:27.040 --> 28:28.040
I'm talking about breakfast.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.040
And you've rambled on long enough.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.040
It's time to go eat at Lenny's.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.040
Denny's.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.040
Denny's.

28:34.040 --> 28:38.040
Now you can have your breakfast or lunch served in ten minutes,

28:38.040 --> 28:40.040
or it's free, only at Denny's.

28:44.040 --> 28:47.040
It's where individuals become a family.

28:48.040 --> 28:53.040
It's where they share memories and news and opinions.

28:54.040 --> 28:56.040
It's where parents get to know their children

28:56.040 --> 28:58.040
and their children's children.

28:59.040 --> 29:02.040
Homes will always be an important part of people's lives.

29:02.040 --> 29:05.040
That's why home loans are such a secure investment.

29:05.040 --> 29:07.040
And that's where Home Savings of America

29:07.040 --> 29:11.040
has put its depositors' money for more than a hundred years.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.040
Juice.

29:16.040 --> 29:17.040
Quiet, please.

29:19.040 --> 29:21.040
Oh no, I'm not here.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.040
When allergies come on this strong,

29:23.040 --> 29:26.040
Benadryl comes on stronger.

29:28.040 --> 29:31.040
A change is coming, it's understood.

29:31.040 --> 29:34.040
Happening all over my neighborhood.

29:34.040 --> 29:37.040
Only one place got the taste for me.

29:37.040 --> 29:40.040
Gonna change the pizza hut delivery.

29:40.040 --> 29:43.040
Call Pizza Hut Delivery now for the Double Cheeseburger Pizza.

Gonna change the pizza hut delivery.

30:07.040 --> 30:10.040
Pizza Hut Delivery, Bacon and Grape.

30:12.040 --> 30:13.040
It's here.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.040
Trying is believing week,

30:14.040 --> 30:18.040
and here's how people who are trying breakfast with grape nuts feel.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.040
You've got to try it.

30:19.040 --> 30:21.040
I did, and I feel great.

30:21.040 --> 30:25.040
It's a great natural energy source, and it's fat-free.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.040
You won't believe how good you feel.

30:27.040 --> 30:28.040
I do.

30:28.040 --> 30:30.040
I feel great.

30:30.040 --> 30:33.040
Grape nuts cereal is full of complex carbohydrates.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.040
You won't believe how it helps keep you going all morning.

30:35.040 --> 30:37.040
Look for this display in your store.

30:37.040 --> 30:39.040
Post-grape nuts trying is believing week.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.040
You've got to do it.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.040
Um, excuse me.

30:43.040 --> 30:47.040
In a blind test, women compared new advanced formula

30:47.040 --> 30:49.040
Agree shampoo to an expensive salon brand,

30:49.040 --> 30:51.040
Red Can Amino Pond.

30:51.040 --> 30:53.040
Guess which one they like better?

30:53.040 --> 30:56.040
Agree. It's that good.

30:57.040 --> 31:00.040
Aren't Ritz and Ritz-Bitz really the same?

31:00.040 --> 31:02.040
Well, that's a silly question.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.040
One's bigger, one's little.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.040
So they're different.

31:05.040 --> 31:06.040
But they're still the same.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.040
So they're the same.

31:07.040 --> 31:09.040
Don't you get it?

31:09.040 --> 31:12.040
Ritz or Ritz-Bitz, two sizes fits all.

31:12.040 --> 31:13.040
Wednesday.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.040
I took buster to the vet.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.040
And?

31:15.040 --> 31:17.040
Honey, is there something wrong with him?

31:17.040 --> 31:18.040
Well, nothing.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.040
He can't be fixed.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.040
You'll get sympathy pains on the Wonder Years.

31:21.040 --> 31:22.040
Then?

31:22.040 --> 31:23.040
You're playing.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.040
A special episode.

31:24.040 --> 31:27.040
Nobody makes blueberry pancakes like you do, Margaret.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.040
Oh, those aren't blueberry pancakes.

31:28.040 --> 31:30.040
Share memories of grandpa.

31:30.040 --> 31:33.040
On Growing Pains, Wednesday.

31:51.040 --> 31:54.040
To be the one company big enough and innovative enough

31:54.040 --> 31:56.040
to offer plans where you never have to fill out

31:56.040 --> 31:59.040
one single claim form.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.040
Blue Cross of California.

32:01.040 --> 32:03.040
We make the system work for you.

32:07.040 --> 32:12.040
While the competition only offers a three-year warranty plan,

32:12.040 --> 32:16.040
TaylorMade Office Systems offers an exclusive five-year warranty

32:16.040 --> 32:18.040
plan on their Canon NP copiers

32:18.040 --> 32:22.040
with all of the guarantees in writing.

32:22.040 --> 32:26.040
Remember that the next time your copier company feeds you,

32:26.040 --> 32:28.040
the same old line.

32:48.040 --> 32:50.040
And more overall passenger space.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.040
Stop having fun.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.040
It doesn't add up.

32:53.040 --> 32:54.040
The Isuzu Rodeo.

32:54.040 --> 32:56.040
True, it doesn't add up.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.040
Isuzu, there's no comparison.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.040
Now, with factor-to-dealer incentives,

32:59.040 --> 33:01.040
air conditioning comes standard with any 4x2 Rodeo

33:01.040 --> 33:03.040
for a limited time.

33:03.040 --> 33:05.040
Lots of men have heard about Monoxadil.

33:05.040 --> 33:07.040
And lots of men have heard about Rogaine.

33:07.040 --> 33:11.040
But lots of men don't know that only Rogaine has Monoxadil.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.040
And only your doctor can prescribe Rogaine.

33:14.040 --> 33:17.040
For more information, call this number now.

33:17.040 --> 33:20.040
If you're wondering where the Rogaine is for you,

33:20.040 --> 33:21.040
call this number.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.040
And we'll give you an incentive to find out.

33:23.040 --> 33:28.040
A certificate worth $10 toward a consultation visit with your doctor.

33:28.040 --> 33:32.040
Call 1-800-556-4800.

33:47.040 --> 33:50.040
Some men would rather live their lives sheltered in the harbor.

33:50.040 --> 33:52.040
And some would rather sail into life

33:52.040 --> 33:56.040
with the unmistakable scent of Old Spice.

33:56.040 --> 33:59.040
Clean, true, and classic, Old Spice.

33:59.040 --> 34:02.040
One of the legends of the sea.

34:05.040 --> 34:07.040
What are you sitting here doing?

34:07.040 --> 34:08.040
Excuse me.

34:08.040 --> 34:09.040
Aren't you glad you used dials?

34:09.040 --> 34:11.040
To the airport. Let's go.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.040
Are we over the window here?

34:12.040 --> 34:14.040
Don't you wish everybody did?

34:14.040 --> 34:15.040
Right, Rogaine.

34:15.040 --> 34:18.040
Are you going to handle for this window?

34:18.040 --> 34:21.040
So I start watching the Discovery Channel.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.040
Thought maybe I'll learn something.

34:22.040 --> 34:24.040
Then I see they have this guide, you know,

34:24.040 --> 34:26.040
to kind of help you figure out when everything's on.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.040
So I order it. Real easy.

34:27.040 --> 34:30.040
Just 1-800-TDC-8343.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.040
And I charge it.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.040
And now a few weeks later, it's here.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.040
I mean, look at this thing.

34:34.040 --> 34:35.040
It's a magazine.

34:35.040 --> 34:38.040
T-D-C Magazine.

34:38.040 --> 34:39.040
I open it up.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.040
And there's this grid,

34:40.040 --> 34:43.040
which is great because I can see the whole week at a glance.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.040
I just circle the shows I want to see.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.040
And look at this.

34:46.040 --> 34:49.040
It's a complete description of every single show.

34:49.040 --> 34:50.040
And check this out.

34:50.040 --> 34:52.040
These photographs. Gorgeous.

34:52.040 --> 34:55.040
There's even articles by famous authors.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.040
Amazing.

34:56.040 --> 34:58.040
All I expected was a program guide,

34:58.040 --> 34:59.040
and I get all this.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.040
What a bargain.

35:01.040 --> 35:04.040
I wonder if they'll ever be a swimsuit issue.

35:04.040 --> 35:07.040
Call now to order your T-D-C Magazine

35:07.040 --> 35:10.040
and receive 12 monthly issues for only $14.95.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.040
That's more than 50% off the cover price.

35:12.040 --> 35:14.040
Or tell the operator to bill you later.

35:14.040 --> 35:17.040
These and MasterCard accepted.

35:17.040 --> 35:20.040
It's never one food that gives you what you need.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.040
It's the combination and the balance.

35:22.040 --> 35:24.040
And how you balance the combinations.

35:24.040 --> 35:26.040
So at McDonald's, there's lots to choose from.

35:26.040 --> 35:29.040
Lean burgers to low-fat shakes and frozen yogurt.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.040
Salads.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.040
No fat.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.040
No cholesterol.

35:32.040 --> 35:33.040
Apple brand muffins.

35:33.040 --> 35:36.040
And cholesterol free oil for our chicken, potatoes, and fish.

35:36.040 --> 35:39.040
We've got a long list of good foods to choose from.

35:39.040 --> 35:43.040
All you've got to do is just choose the food for you.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.040
Always good food.

35:44.040 --> 35:48.040
Always good value at McDonald's.

35:48.040 --> 35:50.040
It can be downright frustrating

35:50.040 --> 35:53.040
and difficult to get perfect orange juice.

35:53.040 --> 35:56.040
One with that pure fresh squeeze taste

35:56.040 --> 35:59.040
with no water added or taken away.

35:59.040 --> 36:02.040
But if you remember that no other major brand of juice

36:02.040 --> 36:04.040
comes closer to this,

36:04.040 --> 36:07.040
than this Tropicana Pure Premium,

36:07.040 --> 36:12.040
you'll think you'll find everything will just fall into place.

36:12.040 --> 36:14.040
Tropicana Pure Premium.

36:14.040 --> 36:17.040
Also appearing in 96 ounces.

36:18.040 --> 36:23.040
Call me irresponsible.

36:23.040 --> 36:25.040
Just because the other guy is on the road

36:25.040 --> 36:27.040
doesn't mean his mind is.

36:27.040 --> 36:30.040
So the superb traction of the Subaru Legacy

36:30.040 --> 36:32.040
with four-wheel drive and anti-lock brakes

36:32.040 --> 36:34.040
can be quite a comfort.

36:34.040 --> 36:37.040
Since the next guy is capable of almost anything,

36:37.040 --> 36:40.040
shouldn't the same be true of your next car?

36:42.040 --> 36:45.040
Factory to dealer cash could mean great savings to you

36:45.040 --> 36:47.040
during the Subaru Spring Value Days.

36:47.040 --> 36:49.040
Three hours, nine minutes.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.040
May I ask what you're doing?

36:50.040 --> 36:52.040
Timing tiny time pills.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.040
Excuse me?

36:53.040 --> 36:54.040
Well, this morning when I woke up, I talked like this,

36:54.040 --> 36:55.040
and I didn't like that.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.040
So I took a contact.

36:56.040 --> 37:00.040
So, well, contact has 600 tiny time pills at last 12 hours.

37:00.040 --> 37:02.040
Up to three times longer than ordinary cold medicine.

37:02.040 --> 37:05.040
There's a whole day's work in every contact.

37:05.040 --> 37:07.040
Eight hours and 30 seconds.

37:07.040 --> 37:10.040
Look, if you're going to time the tiny time pills all day,

37:10.040 --> 37:11.040
when are you going to do the work?

37:11.040 --> 37:12.040
Right.

37:12.040 --> 37:14.040
You time.

37:14.040 --> 37:17.040
There's a whole day's work in every contact.

37:17.040 --> 37:19.040
Coming to ABC.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.040
I'll give you three and a half in time served.

37:20.040 --> 37:22.040
No way. Two years tops.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.040
Three. Two and a half.

37:23.040 --> 37:24.040
Three or no deal.

37:24.040 --> 37:25.040
Done.

37:25.040 --> 37:28.040
You know something's wrong and you still want to try this case?

37:28.040 --> 37:31.040
You said you took it on the cases nobody else wanted.

37:32.040 --> 37:36.040
How the hell are we supposed to win a case without witnesses?

37:36.040 --> 37:37.040
They'll deny it.

37:37.040 --> 37:40.040
Oh, your honor, we got a big problem here.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.040
Treat Williams.

37:41.040 --> 37:43.040
You mean you're a real lawyer?

37:43.040 --> 37:44.040
Surprise.

37:44.040 --> 37:48.040
Eddie Dodd, premiering this week on ABC TV.

37:48.040 --> 37:50.040
Announcing something you've never seen before

37:50.040 --> 37:53.040
in an inexpensive Macintosh.

37:53.040 --> 37:56.040
Color.

37:56.040 --> 37:57.040
Lifetime.

37:57.040 --> 38:01.040
No wonder many of us seem to always make bell calling card.

38:01.040 --> 38:05.040
You can easily charge calls wherever you are,

38:05.040 --> 38:10.040
whether you're just down the street or somewhere up the coast.

38:10.040 --> 38:16.040
But unlike most calling cards, Pacific Bells is based on your own familiar phone number.

38:16.040 --> 38:19.040
And since it's welcome at most every phone,

38:19.040 --> 38:23.040
it's really the only calling card you need to hang on to.

38:23.040 --> 38:27.040
Pacific Bell, we're making things easier everywhere.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.040
McDonald's explodes another myth.

38:34.040 --> 38:37.040
If it's no fat, it can't be delicious.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.040
Not so.

38:38.040 --> 38:42.040
Introducing McLean Deluxe, made with a 91% fat free beef patty.

38:42.040 --> 38:44.040
Low fat and delicious.

38:44.040 --> 38:45.040
Can't be done.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.040
Can too.

38:46.040 --> 38:49.040
You wanted great burger taste with a lot less fat.

38:49.040 --> 38:51.040
Only McDonald's responded.

38:51.040 --> 38:53.040
New McLean Deluxe will blow you away.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.040
It's terrific.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.040
It can't be low fat.

38:55.040 --> 38:59.040
It's both New McLean Deluxe after billions and billions.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.040
Another first at McDonald's today.

39:26.040 --> 39:29.040
Johnson's Baby Oil.

39:29.040 --> 39:32.040
For skin soft as the day you were born.

39:55.040 --> 39:58.040
See this displayed for colors you can love.

40:00.040 --> 40:03.040
I love where you're not fade away.

40:03.040 --> 40:06.040
Bigoters lurk in small places.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.040
Stick it to them, the snick ups.

40:08.040 --> 40:10.040
Bigoters linger in small places.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.040
Stick it to them, the snick ups.

40:12.040 --> 40:16.040
Airwick has big news, a new decorative design and a great new scent.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.040
Popery sashay.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.040
Stick it to them.

40:18.040 --> 40:21.040
My friend Carol is so different from me.

40:21.040 --> 40:24.040
She does lunchables all at once.

40:24.040 --> 40:25.040
I do it one by one.

40:25.040 --> 40:27.040
We're total opposites.

40:27.040 --> 40:29.040
But we've been best friends forever.

40:29.040 --> 40:31.040
Oscar Meyer Lunchables lunch combinations.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.040
Because lunch is what you make of it.

40:33.040 --> 40:35.040
McDonald's explodes another myth.

40:35.040 --> 40:38.040
If it's low fat, it can't be delicious.

40:38.040 --> 40:39.040
Not so.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.040
Introducing McLean Deluxe.

40:41.040 --> 40:44.040
Made with a 91% fat free beef patty.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.040
Low fat and delicious.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.040
Can't be done.

40:46.040 --> 40:47.040
Can too.

You wanted great burger taste with a lot less fat.

41:00.040 --> 41:03.040
Another first at McDonald's today.

41:06.040 --> 41:11.040
Make me, make me your baby.

41:11.040 --> 41:18.040
Touch me, touch me and maybe you will see.

41:18.040 --> 41:24.040
How baby soft you can be.

41:24.040 --> 41:28.040
Make me, make me your baby.

41:28.040 --> 41:30.040
Johnson's Baby Oil.

41:30.040 --> 41:33.040
For skin soft as the day you were born.

41:33.040 --> 41:38.040
I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna be.

41:38.040 --> 41:43.040
Are you gonna give your love to me?

41:43.040 --> 41:48.040
I wanna love you night and day.

41:48.040 --> 41:51.040
You know my love and I fade away.

41:51.040 --> 41:53.040
Meet the Kodak Colorkin toys.

41:53.040 --> 41:56.040

42:01.040 --> 42:04.040
I love where you're not fade away.

42:04.040 --> 42:07.040
Bigoters lurk in small places.

42:07.040 --> 42:09.040
Stick it to up the snick ups.

42:09.040 --> 42:11.040
Bigoters linger in small places.

42:11.040 --> 42:12.040
Stick it to up the snick ups.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.040
Airwick has big news.

42:14.040 --> 42:16.040
A new decorative design and a great new scent.

42:16.040 --> 42:17.040
Popories as she is.

42:17.040 --> 42:19.040
Stick it to up.

42:19.040 --> 42:21.040
My friend Carol is so different from me.

42:21.040 --> 42:24.040
She does Lunchables all at once.

42:24.040 --> 42:26.040
But I do it one by one.

42:26.040 --> 42:28.040
We're total opposites.

42:28.040 --> 42:30.040
But we've been best friends forever.

42:30.040 --> 42:32.040
Oscar Meyer Lunchables lunch combinations.

42:32.040 --> 42:34.040
Because lunch is what you make of it.

42:36.040 --> 42:38.040
Poor Sam and Samantha.

42:38.040 --> 42:40.040
So young and yet so glum.

42:40.040 --> 42:42.040
Changing time was just no fun.

42:42.040 --> 42:44.040
But old mother Goose waved her wing

42:44.040 --> 42:46.040
and put all the magic of story time

42:46.040 --> 42:48.040
into new Huggies diapers.

42:48.040 --> 42:49.040
Just the thing.

42:49.040 --> 42:51.040
Nursery Rhymes.

42:51.040 --> 42:53.040
Learning Rhymes.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.040
Playful pictures too.

42:55.040 --> 42:57.040
Eleven designs in every package.

42:57.040 --> 42:59.040
Now Sam and Samantha are full of glee

42:59.040 --> 43:01.040
in new story time Huggies.

43:01.040 --> 43:04.040
And changing time is happy as can be.

43:04.040 --> 43:06.040
You may have noticed lately

43:06.040 --> 43:08.040
that lots of people are having considerable trouble

43:08.040 --> 43:10.040
walking and chewing gum at the same time.

43:10.040 --> 43:13.040
Perhaps it's because of the great taste of Trident.

43:13.040 --> 43:15.040
Original fruit and bubble.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.040
Trident. Good for your teeth.

43:17.040 --> 43:19.040
And great taste too.

43:19.040 --> 43:20.040
But I told him.

43:20.040 --> 43:22.040
Well look, maybe the guy wasn't listening.

43:22.040 --> 43:24.040
Oh, here it comes.

43:28.040 --> 43:31.040
When allergies come on this strong,

43:31.040 --> 43:34.040
Benadryl comes on stronger.

43:35.040 --> 43:37.040
Oh boy, you know, Roger,

43:37.040 --> 43:40.040
I haven't seen anything this nasty since Rosie.

43:40.040 --> 43:42.040
What do you want?

43:42.040 --> 43:43.040
A monkey.

43:43.040 --> 43:45.040
It's gonna be a belly-wagger.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.040
Wow, good night.

43:47.040 --> 43:49.040
Turn up the light.

43:53.040 --> 43:55.040
Uh-oh.

43:57.040 --> 43:58.040
Little Caesars.

43:58.040 --> 43:59.040
Cheezer-Cheezer.

43:59.040 --> 44:01.040
Not one, but two pizzas loaded with cheese

44:01.040 --> 44:03.040
and up to five toppings for $8.98.

44:03.040 --> 44:05.040
Cheezer-Cheezer.

44:05.040 --> 44:07.040
Bravely, Fred has faced one too many healthy

44:07.040 --> 44:09.040
but boring breakfast.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.040
Enough!

44:10.040 --> 44:12.040
I want taste, indulgence.

44:12.040 --> 44:14.040
Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats.

44:14.040 --> 44:15.040
A friend.

44:15.040 --> 44:17.040
Ooh, naughty frosting.

44:17.040 --> 44:19.040
Freddy, Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats

44:19.040 --> 44:21.040
are good for you, there's fiber.

44:21.040 --> 44:22.040
No.

44:22.040 --> 44:23.040
And no salt.

44:23.040 --> 44:25.040
But they taste so good.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.040
And they're fat-free, see?

44:27.040 --> 44:28.040
Fat-free?

44:28.040 --> 44:29.040
Kellogg's Frosted Mini Wheats.

44:29.040 --> 44:31.040
Surprise, they're good for you.

44:31.040 --> 44:33.040
You see it your way?

44:33.040 --> 44:35.040
I see it mine.

44:35.040 --> 44:37.040
We're all going to Italy Tuesday

44:37.040 --> 44:39.040
when Tony and Harrods are vineyard.

44:39.040 --> 44:41.040
Greetings, fellow villagers.

44:41.040 --> 44:43.040
He's welcomed with Christ's freedom.

44:43.040 --> 44:44.040
Who's the boss?

44:44.040 --> 44:45.040
And at a special time,

44:45.040 --> 44:47.040
net-baity guest stars.

44:47.040 --> 44:48.040
That's a chemistry set.

44:48.040 --> 44:49.040
Every boy should have one.

44:49.040 --> 44:51.040
No, you shouldn't have done that, Ed.

44:51.040 --> 44:53.040
We could just turn on the gas and blow ourselves up.

44:53.040 --> 44:55.040
An hour on Roseanne and...

44:55.040 --> 44:57.040
I flew here this morning from Colombia.

44:57.040 --> 44:59.040
A dope smuggler swallows his stage.

44:59.040 --> 45:01.040
If somebody dies, it's not your fault, is it?

45:01.040 --> 45:02.040
No, not totally.

45:02.040 --> 45:04.040
What percentage would you say?

45:04.040 --> 45:06.040
Stat Tuesday.

45:29.040 --> 45:31.040
Johnson's brings out the baby soft shine

45:31.040 --> 45:33.040
born in your hair.

45:59.040 --> 46:01.040
Double fresh, double good.

46:01.040 --> 46:02.040
Come on and double it.

46:02.040 --> 46:04.040
Double meat, double meat.

46:04.040 --> 46:05.040
Gone.

46:05.040 --> 46:07.040
There's no single come light.

46:08.040 --> 46:10.040
It's not so easy to grow beans, you know.

46:10.040 --> 46:12.040
You have to water them,

46:12.040 --> 46:14.040
pull up the weeds,

46:14.040 --> 46:16.040
and tie them up so they can reach the sun.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.040
Then your mother has to help you build a fence

46:18.040 --> 46:20.040
to keep the bunnies out.

46:20.040 --> 46:22.040
Then you have to pick them carefully.

46:22.040 --> 46:25.040
After that, you get to eat them.

46:25.040 --> 46:27.040
And if you're lucky,

46:27.040 --> 46:29.040
your mother will make a ride of golden twirls

46:29.040 --> 46:31.040
to go with them.

46:31.040 --> 46:33.040
Golden twirls are very delicious

46:33.040 --> 46:35.040
and so much fun.

46:35.040 --> 46:37.040
I wonder how they grow these.

46:38.040 --> 46:42.040
The average driver puts 12 to 13,000 miles a year on a car.

46:42.040 --> 46:44.040
At Saturn, we knew this.

46:45.040 --> 46:47.040
Where and how, though, is anyone's guess.

46:47.040 --> 46:49.040
For sure, we knew people would be taking

46:49.040 --> 46:51.040
to new Saturn places.

46:51.040 --> 46:54.040
And using it in ways you'd never figure.

46:54.040 --> 46:56.040
Or even imagine.

46:56.040 --> 46:58.040
So we tested it.

46:58.040 --> 47:00.040
We ran at 6 million miles.

47:00.040 --> 47:02.040
Everywhere.

47:02.040 --> 47:04.040
Sometimes, nowhere.

47:08.040 --> 47:10.040
Wednesday, Kevin's got a big problem

47:10.040 --> 47:12.040
with Paul's little sister.

47:12.040 --> 47:14.040
I'm not taking your sister to the catillion.

47:14.040 --> 47:16.040
I mean, you're gonna have to tell her.

47:16.040 --> 47:18.040
Unpleasant as it might be.

47:18.040 --> 47:20.040
It was time to break a heart.

47:20.040 --> 47:22.040
Would you go with me?

47:22.040 --> 47:24.040
The wonder years.

47:24.040 --> 47:27.040
It's European holiday and Mike's getting a head start.

47:27.040 --> 47:29.040
Party! Party!

47:29.040 --> 47:31.040
It's a tale of two vacations.

47:31.040 --> 47:32.040
Happy anniversary.

47:32.040 --> 47:34.040
I'm stranded in Spain with a crazy woman.

47:34.040 --> 47:36.040
Catch all the fun Wednesday.

47:54.040 --> 47:56.040
With great burger taste and a lot less fat.

47:56.040 --> 47:58.040
But don't fill up on the press.

47:58.040 --> 47:59.040
Taste for yourself.

47:59.040 --> 48:01.040
One bite and you'll be talking about it, too.

48:01.040 --> 48:02.040
The Swallow First.

48:02.040 --> 48:03.040
New Maclean Deluxe.

48:03.040 --> 48:05.040
After billions and billions.

48:05.040 --> 48:07.040
Another first at McDonald's today.

48:09.040 --> 48:12.040
Bradley decided to express his artistic talent

48:12.040 --> 48:14.040
on the living room wall.

48:14.040 --> 48:16.040
A little more covered in one coat.

48:16.040 --> 48:17.040
They're so cute at that age.

48:17.040 --> 48:19.040
You can't get mad at them.

48:19.040 --> 48:20.040
Wanna bet?

48:20.040 --> 48:22.040
Are you sure you have everything?

48:22.040 --> 48:23.040
Yeah.

48:23.040 --> 48:24.040
Turn around.

48:24.040 --> 48:25.040
Hmm.

48:25.040 --> 48:28.040
I got the Fuji film while you were in cosmetics.

48:28.040 --> 48:29.040
I didn't forget.

48:29.040 --> 48:30.040
Oh.

48:30.040 --> 48:31.040
You forgot you married the perfect husband.

48:31.040 --> 48:32.040
You were right, Dad.

48:32.040 --> 48:33.040
Kmart's pretty cool.

48:33.040 --> 48:35.040
You should listen to me more often.

48:39.040 --> 48:42.040
Of all pine cleaners, more people choose pine saw.

48:42.040 --> 48:44.040
Pine saw's got more active ingredients

48:44.040 --> 48:46.040
than the next leading brand.

48:46.040 --> 48:48.040
And pine saw disinfects better.

48:48.040 --> 48:50.040
It even kills staff germs.

48:50.040 --> 48:52.040
It's not really clean until...

48:52.040 --> 48:54.040
It's pine-solved.

48:54.040 --> 48:58.040
Friday on Full House, Joey and Jesse get close to nature.

48:58.040 --> 48:59.040
Woo-hoo!

49:01.040 --> 49:03.040
Mr. Fox!

49:03.040 --> 49:06.040
Maybe even a little too close.

49:06.040 --> 49:08.040
Ooh-la-la!

49:08.040 --> 49:11.040
It's time for a boy to become a man.

49:11.040 --> 49:13.040
Your mother sent out 150 invitations

49:13.040 --> 49:16.040
and we got 10 tons of potato salad downstairs.

49:16.040 --> 49:17.040
Rejoice!

49:17.040 --> 49:20.040
Robbie comes of age on his howling day.

49:20.040 --> 49:23.040
And all new dinosaurs ride up to Full House Friday.

49:23.040 --> 49:24.040
This one for me?

49:50.040 --> 49:52.040
Is this your kid?

49:52.040 --> 49:54.040
And is he drinking the only juice drink

49:54.040 --> 49:57.040
with a full day's vitamin C, four other vitamins,

49:57.040 --> 49:58.040
and all natural flavors?

49:58.040 --> 50:00.040
Well, maybe this isn't your kid.

50:00.040 --> 50:02.040
But this should be your kid.

50:02.040 --> 50:03.040
This is your kid.

50:03.040 --> 50:04.040

Can I help you, Kim?

52:00.040 --> 52:01.040
Yes, you can help me.

52:01.040 --> 52:02.040
No, we need to handle our灵s.

52:02.040 --> 52:03.040

52:09.040 --> 52:24.040
Kiss me once and kiss me twice and kiss me once again, it's been a long, long, long time.

52:24.040 --> 52:27.720
Oreo Unlock the Magic.

52:27.720 --> 52:37.160
Now appearing at a Burger King near you, a cool new star, Snickers ice cream bar, rich

52:37.160 --> 52:44.040
milk chocolate, buttery caramel, and fresh roasted peanuts, together with a cool taste

52:44.040 --> 52:46.640
of premium ice cream.

52:46.640 --> 52:52.680
Just the way you like it, so have it your way with the coolest new star, Snickers ice

52:52.680 --> 52:54.680
cream bar at Burger King.

53:07.160 --> 53:36.160
Break the mold, taste the cold, the diet's 7-up, it's a few degrees away from the ice cream

53:37.160 --> 53:43.160
The diet's 7-up with Nutrisweet, break the ice.

53:43.160 --> 54:03.160
The best of Disney 50 years of magic will continue in a moment.

54:03.160 --> 54:08.160
Customs officials harassed for reporting possible corruption in the war on drugs.

54:08.160 --> 54:12.160
ABC News investigation on world news tonight with Peter Jennings tomorrow.

54:14.160 --> 54:20.160

55:03.160 --> 55:13.160
Everything we do, USA begins with you.

55:27.160 --> 55:32.160
The world's wildest acrobats are doing the wild thing, Green World.

55:32.160 --> 55:37.160

My man Rick, a serious burger lover.

56:49.160 --> 56:52.160
Is doing a blind taste test of McDonald's New McLean Deluxe Salad.

56:52.160 --> 56:54.160
Gee, you let the taste is gone.

56:54.160 --> 56:58.160
Boom, McDonald's is the only one with this 91% fat-free lean beef fat.

56:58.160 --> 57:00.160
Wait, hold up, 91% fat-free?

57:00.160 --> 57:01.160
No, man.

57:01.160 --> 57:02.160
Straight up.

57:02.160 --> 57:03.160
The taste is kicking.

57:03.160 --> 57:04.160
And it's a serious value.

57:04.160 --> 57:05.160
The New McLean Deluxe.

57:05.160 --> 57:06.160
100% death.

57:06.160 --> 57:07.160
On taste.

57:07.160 --> 57:08.160
On taste.

57:08.160 --> 57:09.160
Word up.

57:11.160 --> 57:13.160
McDonald's today.

57:14.160 --> 57:17.160
A thing about a bonbon, it's almost always gone-gone.

57:17.160 --> 57:19.160
Bonbons are bite-sized.

57:19.160 --> 57:20.160
Bonbons are bite-sized.

57:20.160 --> 57:23.160
Twenty ice cream bells dipped in chocolatey shells.

57:23.160 --> 57:27.160
A thing about a bonbon, it's almost always gone-gone.

57:27.160 --> 57:29.160
Bonbons.

57:29.160 --> 57:34.160
If your socks are announcing unexpected new breakthroughs,

57:34.160 --> 57:37.160
introduce your feet to ours, Burlington Socks,

57:37.160 --> 57:39.160
for quality at a price you'll like.

57:39.160 --> 57:41.160
Burlington Socks.

57:41.160 --> 57:44.160
The green sea means morsak for the money.

57:44.160 --> 57:47.160
Sunday, they're the first inhabitants of the moon

57:47.160 --> 57:49.160
with a dream of a new life.

57:49.160 --> 57:50.160
There's a solar flare heading for them,

57:50.160 --> 57:52.160
but it becomes a fight for survival.

57:52.160 --> 57:53.160
My brother's out there.

57:53.160 --> 57:55.160
I'm not gonna leave him out there to die.

57:55.160 --> 57:56.160
Incoming flurr alert.

57:56.160 --> 57:57.160
Do you copy?

57:57.160 --> 58:00.160
A world premiere movie, Plymouth Sunday.

58:00.160 --> 58:05.160
Next, John Stossel discovers some of the best-kept secrets in childcare.

58:05.160 --> 58:08.160
Mastering the terrible twos, getting your children to sleep,

58:08.160 --> 58:10.160
how to raise a happy child.

58:10.160 --> 58:11.160
Whether you're a parent or not,

58:11.160 --> 58:14.160
don't miss this special edition of 2020.

58:14.160 --> 58:15.160
Next.

58:40.160 --> 58:41.160
We're out there.

58:41.160 --> 58:42.160
That's all they took from me.

58:42.160 --> 58:44.160
Just to put them on one time.

59:10.160 --> 59:13.160
New Kodak Gold 400 film.

59:40.160 --> 59:44.160
Buy it today and get $5 back with our Nabisco rebate offers.

59:44.160 --> 59:45.160
The Jungle Book.

59:45.160 --> 59:47.160
You can't bear to be without it.

59:47.160 --> 59:51.160
Whoa, Mom, this isn't Kraft cheese and macaroni.

59:51.160 --> 59:52.160
Yeah, I know.

59:52.160 --> 59:53.160
What?

59:53.160 --> 59:54.160
It was cheaper.

59:54.160 --> 59:55.160
I saved a few cents.

59:55.160 --> 59:57.160
Mom, it's not the cheesiest.

59:57.160 --> 59:58.160
What's the difference?

59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.160
No, no, no.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.160
Sam, come on, pal.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.160
Dinner.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:07.160
Mom, you never serve anything but Kraft cheese and macaroni, right?

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.160
I wouldn't dream of it.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:12.160
Kids love Kraft cheese and macaroni, and that's worth every penny.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:17.160
Kraft macaroni and cheese and new dinosaur and teddy bear shapes, too.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.160
Tuesday.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.160
Ugh, you're going to hate L.A.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.160
I will.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.160
Melissa's got a job on a sitcom.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.160
Do you have a real feel for the show?

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.160
Loves the star.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.160
It's a pressure cooker.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.160
It really is.

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.160
Loves the writer.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.160
Something about you.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:31.160
Hates the business.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.160
Who do you want us to contact?

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:33.160
Excuse me.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.160
Who represents you?

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.160
I do.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.160
30-something Tuesday.

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:14.160
You're not leaving until you eat breakfast, so you might as well do it.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.160
If we've told you once, we've told you a thousand times.

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:20.160
Have you forgotten everything we taught you?

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:25.160
A suggestion for all you grown-ups who think there's no time for a hot breakfast.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:26.160
Kellogg's Pop Tarts.

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:28.160
They will fruit.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.160
You like fruit, don't you?

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.160
An open wide.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:34.160
Kellogg's Pop Tarts.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.160
A hot breakfast everyone has time for.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.160
You know you like it.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.160
I'm Kate Kelly in New Orleans.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:51.160
Coming up tonight on Nightcast, the power of voodoo could have determined the outcome of Sunday Super Bowl.

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.160
And are the 49ers superstitious?

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:59.160
I have a little ritual I go through before the game and try to get myself as nervous as possible.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:03.160
I'm just going to stay out of the small towns and stay away from the people working the voodoo.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.160
Voodoo at the Super Bowl.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:13.160
Live coverage from New Orleans continues tonight on Nightcast.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:20.160
For years, we've been telling you how the four-wheel drive Subaru helps the U.S. ski team get to their events early.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:26.160
Yet at the 1989 World Championships, the U.S. team was not the first to arrive.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:32.160
The Norwegians beat us, the French beat us, as did the Italians and the Swedes.

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.160
How'd they do it?

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:42.160
That was the year we lent them all a Subaru.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:47.160
Imagine a Disneyland as big as the city of San Francisco.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:51.160
A Disney world with a surprise around every corner.

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:54.160
43 square miles of tropical paradise.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:03:02.160
The spectacular new Disney MGM Studios theme park and the incredible Epcot Center.

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:13.160
Imagine yourself here, Walt Disney World in Florida, as big as imagination gets.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:17.160
Beauty and the Beast will continue.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:22.160
You never know where history will unfold, but you always know where to turn.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:27.160
The CBS Even News with Dan Rather. You always know when it's CBS News.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.160
Gary's being pushed too far.

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:31.160
If you love me, you must leave me alone.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.160
His worst nightmare is taking shape.

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:36.160
My children are going to be living under the same roof as a rapist.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.160
His last resort, an act of desperation.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.160
Speak now or else forever holds your peace.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.160
I'm going to yell rapist or rapist.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.160
I'm not slanting. Thursday.

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.160
This is CBS.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:56.160
It's the biggest party in the history of Disneyland.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:02.160
Disneyland's year-long 35th anniversary celebration with the biggest parade we've ever staged.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:05.160
Towering four stories over Main Street.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:11.160
Our biggest giveaway ever. A new GEO every day and over 400,000 other prizes.

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:16.160
Plan now for your biggest vacation ever. Disneyland's 35th anniversary.

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.160
Party, party, Disneyland's big.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.160
It's Disneyland's big.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:45.160
You know where it's at.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:49.160
At your Northern California Mazda dealer now.

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:56.160
There are very few guarantees in medicine.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:02.160
But if you have arthritis pain like I do, you should know about Mediprin and the Mediprin guarantee.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:08.160
If two Mediprin don't relieve minor arthritis pain better than two regular aspirin, you get your money back.

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.160
Strong promise?

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.160
Strong medicine.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:14.160
The medicine that concentrates the power of ibuprofen into these potent little caplets.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:18.160
The medicine that guarantees better relief than regular aspirin.

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.160
Better arthritis pain relief. That's the Mediprin guarantee.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:25.160
They know they want to win. They look at the judge and they ask for it.

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.160
The show dog begins with what you feed it.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:30.160
I mix the pedigree with the pedigree meal time because the dogs enjoy it.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.160
It's the perfect combination.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.160
These are champions. They deserve the best.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:37.160
Pedigree. Recommended by top breeders.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:43.160
Right now you're just 90 seconds away from Chef Boyardee with microwave meals.

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:47.160
Chef Boyardee pasta hot and tasty and with no messy cleanup.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.160
Chef Boyardee microwave meals.

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:52.160
Thank goodness in just 90 seconds.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:56.160
This morning I was following a Sears service truck when it dawned on me.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.160
I see Sears trucks all the time.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:03.160
It also dawned on me that I hardly ever see a service truck from those so-called superstores.

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:06.160
So before you make that next big buying decision,

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.160
ask yourself what kind of service you'll get five years from now

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.160
or if they'll even be around to answer the phone.

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:17.160
That's one of the big reasons I feel better when I buy a major appliance or electronics from Sears.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:21.160
And that's what they mean by your money's worth and a whole lot more.

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:25.160
This looks like something my mom would eat.

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:29.160
It's kind of quiet, conservative.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.160
I don't think I can get into this.

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:34.160
I mean, it's just a bunch of flakes.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.160
Hmm.

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:38.160
It doesn't taste the way it looks.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.160
I like the way it crunches.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:43.160
Maybe it's good because it's simple.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.160
Wait, wait. Don't tell me. I'm just like my mother.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:48.160
Kellogg's Corn Flakes.

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.160
Corn Flakes?

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:52.160
Taste them again for the first time.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:54.160
I hope you'll be with us tonight.

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.160
Dan Miller will be live from New Orleans inside the Super Bowl

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:58.160
bringing you updates on goodness knows what

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.160
along with actress Karen Black and much more.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.160
See you later tonight.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:04.160
One, two, three.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.160
On tour with Paul McCartney.

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:09.160
There is life after Beatles.

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.160
A special edition of 48 Hours Thursday.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:17.160
Sammy Davis Jr. 60th Anniversary Celebration

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:19.160
Brought to you by

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.160
Dr. Pepper and your local Dr. Pepper bottler.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.160
Dr. Pepper is just what the doctor ordered.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:29.160
The good time, great taste of McDonald's.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:33.160
AT&T, the right choice.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.160
And Chrysler Corporation and the Chrysler Motorist

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:38.160
Black Dealers Association.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.160
What do you like about your Eagle Premier?

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.160
Everything.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.160
You mean the leather interior and the roominess?

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.160
I said everything.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.160
So what's Premier got that other cars in his class don't they?

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.160
Me.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:56.160
You test drove the Maxima?

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.160
You got it.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.160
The Taurus and the Cressida?

01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.160
You got it.

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.160
Then you tried the Eagle Premier?

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.160
You got it.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.160
What'd you think?

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.160
I got it.

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.160
All the phone cords that bind,

01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:17.160
that hold your small business back.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:21.160
Now AT&T can set you free with the first cordless phone

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:23.160
specifically designed for business.

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.160
The multi-line Merlin cordless.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:28.160
It works with AT&T's small business phone systems

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:32.160
so you don't have to lose any quality to gain your freedom.

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:34.160
Set your business free.

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:40.160
Call 1-800-MERLIN-ATT for the new Merlin cordless.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.160
Who's weather?

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.160
Kate.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.160
Pitch a maroon as due up.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.160
Kate.

01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.160
So Burns is going to have to do his pinch.

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.160
The only choice is John Kane.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.160
Hey, kid.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.160
Can't be the doc?

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.160
Burns has been reluctant.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:57.160
It's Kane's friend to go with the younger players,

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.160
but he may not have a choice here tonight.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.160
Now batting from around.

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.160
Kane.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.160
I got into him.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.160
This is Hubert Strohls.

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:18.160
Austrian downhill racer and Olympic gold medalist.

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.160
He's not afraid of extreme vertical drops.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:25.160
He's not afraid of speeds over 90 miles an hour.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:29.160
He's not afraid of anything except going slow.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:30.160
But if you think he's tough,

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.160
wait till you see the guys at the ticket window

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.160
at the Olympics if you don't have your Visa card

01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:39.160
because the Olympics don't take American Express.

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.160
Asa, it's every way you want to be.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.160
We really missed you, man.

01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:45.160
Really.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.160
You were left all night long.

01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.160
It was your kind of thing.

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:52.160
You made me laugh.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.160
It was so embarrassing.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.160
I haven't seen him in years.

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.160
It was great.

01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:57.160
He still cracks me out.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.160
I'll tell you one more time because I think I liked it.

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:00.160
I just did that.

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:02.160
We just did that, yeah.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.160
No one helps you share the feelings like AT&T long distance.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.160
I wish you could have been here, too.

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:12.160
AT&T, all you need to reach out.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:15.160
I love chasing quarterbacks.

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.160
When you've got the style of Hanes socks,

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:22.160
who wants to run around and cleats?

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:28.160
Hanes, nothing else feels so right.

01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:29.160
Like to try total?

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.160
Mom says grape nuts.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:31.160
Hope you're hungry.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.160
It takes four bowls of grape nuts

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:35.160
to get the vitamins in one bowl of total.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:37.160
Total has 100% of a day's supply

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.160
of 12 vitamins and minerals.

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.160
You tell her.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.160
Total, one bowl, 100%.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:47.160
Red Lobster announces great new trios.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.160
Six delicious trios you're going to love.

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:50.160
Terrific.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.160
Like our large butterfly shrimp.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.160
Lobster alfredo and scallops.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.160
Love it.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.160
Or our crab legs.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.160
Juicy scallops and shrimp.

01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.160
Let's go.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:03.160
But hurry, our great new trios won't last long.

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:07.160
Red Lobster for the secret lover.

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.160
Try the trio with the unbeatable price.

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:11.160
Our Atlantic trio, just $6.99.

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.160
$6.99?

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.160
That's incredible.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.160
On One Life to Live, the start of a love affair.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:18.160
This is going to be a good trip.

01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:20.160
Or the beginning of the end.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:21.160
Oh.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:23.160
It's an attraction that could be fatal.

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.160
You're perfectly safe in the boat.

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.160
Trust me.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.160
You'll never forget the incident at Loom Lake

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:29.160
on One Life to Live.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.160
Ford trucks.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.160
The best.

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:35.160
Never a rest.

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:38.160
The first vehicle Henry Ford sold was not a car.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.160
It was a truck.

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:42.160
Our full-size pickups were first with rear anti-lock brakes.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.160
First with electronic overdrive transmission.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.160
First with push-button four-wheel drive.

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:48.160
Now what does all this get you?

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:50.160
It gets you number one.

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:54.160
And if you keep doing it, you stay number one.

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.160
More people are driving the best-built,

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.160
best-selling American trucks than ever before.

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:11.160
Fresh in breath and taste great.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.160
People who use plain-calamine lotions to relieve itches

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:20.160
or poison ivy are easy to spot.

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:23.160
But new-caladrial clear not only works better to stop the itch,

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.160
it dries this clear.

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:28.160
So nobody will ever spot you.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:30.160
New-caladrial clear.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:32.160
One man unwilling to forgive.

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:35.160
You break the law, it'll come running back to me.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.160
The other unable to forget.

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:39.160
I swore an oath to my country,

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.160
not to what was going on over there.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.160
Charlton Heston, Peter Strauss, Proud Men, Saturday.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.160
China Beach will continue in a moment.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.160
Can life come from lava?

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.160
Tomorrow on Good Morning America,

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:01.160
how a lava field blossoms into one of nature's miracles.

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.160
Then meet Vi Warshawski.

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:05.160
Kathleen Turner turns private eye in her new role.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:08.160
We'll bomb back here on Good Morning America tomorrow.

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:14.160
You know, the Channel 7 newsroom is not unlike the community in which we live.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.160
We are an eclectic mix.

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.160
Everyone comes from different backgrounds.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.160
We are a boisterous, diversified group.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:25.160
Everyone has their own ideas in the newsroom about how they think the day should go.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:29.160
We tend to have loud laughs and loud debates.

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:32.160
I think the newsroom is a microcosm of the community.

01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.160
We're really a cross-section of the Bay Area.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.160
In a formal life, Sandy can be seen walking in the park,

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:50.160
wearing stirrup pants and stretch denim.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:55.160
A deep, purple waterproof parka with an attic fleece lining.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.160
And a black rubber backpack.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:06.160
A line and a climb.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:15.160
Jodie, who lives on Russian Hill, is talking to her brother Peter, who lives in Eureka.

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:21.160
Remarkably, this call costs 25% less than last month,

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.160
because Peter is in Jodie's bonus zone,

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:27.160
and Jodie just got call bonus from Pacific Bell.

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:30.160
Wherever you live in California, call us.

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:34.160
We'll check and see if call bonus can save you money too.

01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:37.160
For 1-800-PAC-BELL, we're making things easier.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.160
Another wimpy sandwich.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:45.160
Not me. I've got vintage farms deli loafing.

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:47.160
It's got real sliced meat chunks.

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:51.160
Still going, nothing outlasts the energizer.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:55.160
They keep going and going and go.

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:05.160
A better way to catch your zizz is on Sealy's new posturepedic sleep system,

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.160
designed to conform to your shape,

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:11.160
distribute your weight evenly, comfortably.

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:13.160
Only Sealy posturepedic has it,

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.160
so for a better night's sleep, better sleep on a Sealy.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.160
Someone finally made oatmeal the way I like it.

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.160
He doesn't like oatmeal.

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:26.160
Oatmeal crisp is big, crispy flakes with oatmeal.

01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:29.160
Little brown sugar, lots of crunchy almonds.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.160
Don't you lie to your mother.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.160
Look Ma, I'm eating my oatmeal.

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:36.160
Look Ma, I'm eating my oatmeal.

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.160
Oatmeal crisp, oatmeal raisin crisp.

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.160
Look Ma, I found something for nothing.

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:45.160
Pop secret popcorn, free and specially marked boxes of oatmeal crisp and oatmeal raisin crisp.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.160
Be sure and write them a nice email.

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.160
I'll see you next time.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.160
Please, thank you Lord.

01:15:56.160 --> 01:16:00.160
Now there's a new reason to put down those fizzy diet colas.

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:03.160
It's crystal light in a new shade.

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.160
Pink grapefruit.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:09.160
Light and luscious with no carbonation.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.160
Okay, sit down.

01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:14.160
Ring side seats.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.160
250 bucks.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:18.160
This is gonna be great.

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:22.160
These days a good value is hard to come by.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.160
Unless you come by KFC for the amazing double bucket deal.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:32.160
For a limited time get a 10 piece bucket of chicken for 8 bucks and the seconds just 4 bucks.

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.160
Repeat 4 bucks.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.160
The double bucket deal only from KFC.

01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:46.160
He was rock's first and only king.

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:50.160
He had the fame, the cash, the women.

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.160
And he had the pills, the pains.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:56.160
One woman saw it all, lived it all.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:59.160
This is her remarkable story.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:06.160
Priscilla Presley's devastating account of life and death in the eye of the storm.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:10.160
Elvis and me, Sunday.

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:18.160
Here is a group of people who were going along doing what they do better than they'd ever done it before.

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.160
And someone came along and pulled the rug out.

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.160
It was a struggle for survival.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:25.160
Peter Jennings reporting from the heart of Harlem Thursday.

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:50.160
Only 99 cents each.

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.160
McDonald's today.

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:57.160
The breakfast burrito only 99 cents each at McDonald's today.

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:06.160
The Pepsi Summit Chill Out gives us permission to let our hair down.

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:11.160
What is it? Chill out?

01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:13.160
I don't know, but what else am I gonna do this summer?

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:18.160
It's games, promotions, fun, and free costs.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.160
It's like Woodstock Man.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.160
People in tight pants moving fast.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:31.160
For my family, Tartar Control Aquafresh fights Tartar.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.160
Who makes you feel this fresh?

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:36.160
Tartar Control Aquafresh helps remove plaque.

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:38.160
Who makes you feel this fresh?

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.160
Tartar Control Aquafresh fights cavities.

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.160
And makes you feel this fresh.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:51.160
Only Tartar Control Aquafresh is the fresh way to fight cavities, fight plaque, and fight tartar, all with one great aquafresh taste.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.160
Tartar Control Aquafresh.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.160
It fights tartar.

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:57.160
And makes you feel this fresh.

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:03.160
I've got great news for everyone who uses bleach to clean up the kitchen and bath.

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:07.160
New Clorox Cleanup is a bleach, specially designed for cleaning.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:11.160
You see, Clorox added a special cleaner to bleach, so it cleans even better.

01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:18.160
Now you can clean up stains, clean up germs, and clean up greasy dirt bleach alone leaves behind.

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:23.160
So, when you reach for a bleach to clean up, reach for the one with a special cleaner inside.

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:25.160
New Clorox Cleanup.

01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:28.160
Cleans like bleach, only better.

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:31.160
Coming to ABC this fall.

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:34.160
The war is over.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.160
A celebration has begun.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:45.160
Boys have returned as men to open arms, to laughter, and to love.

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:50.160
Sir, the whole time I was over there, all I thought about was you.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.160
How am I going to tell them?

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:54.160
Is she seeing someone else?

01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.160
Is she what?

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:57.160
These are their stories of triumph.

01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:00.160
This is an impressive record, soldier.

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.160
And despair.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.160
They can't pay you less than other men on the line.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.160
They can if I'm a janitor.

01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:07.160
Their hope for the future.

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.160
Hank has been fighting a war, not dating.

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:11.160
Their dreams left behind.

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:13.160
Americans are wonderful people.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:17.160
Linda, if you'd made an effort to pretty yourself up, you wouldn't have lost Mike to somebody.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:20.160
They became wartime heroes.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:23.160
Now, they've returned to the home front.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:34.160
China Beach will continue in a moment.

The force was so tremendous, the bus smashed through the walls.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:02.160

No reason not to have sex.

Presenting Oscar Maya deli thin slices.

Deli fresh taste without the deli.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:45.160
Can you believe it when some margarine say buttery taste and there's no butter in them?

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:49.160
Craft touch of butter spread has rich creamy butter in it.

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.160
Just a touch.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.160
Craft touch of butter.
