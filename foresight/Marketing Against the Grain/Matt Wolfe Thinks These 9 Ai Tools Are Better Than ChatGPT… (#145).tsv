0	4320	On this episode of Marketing Against the Green, we talked to Matt Wolf.
4320	8800	Matt has one of the biggest and best YouTube channels, all about AI, and so we had to talk
8800	11720	to Matt all about apps and tools.
11720	17120	We get into the biggest AI winners, the biggest AI losers, and who are going to be the biggest
17120	18680	AI apps in the future?
18680	20720	Where should you invest your money?
20720	22800	I'm Kieran Flanagan, the CMO at Zapier.
22800	26600	I'm here always with my co-host, Kip Bonner, the CMO at HubSpot.
26600	27600	Let's get into it.
27600	40520	Okay, Matt, it is great to have you on the show.
40520	45440	I've spent a lot of hours watching your YouTube channel, getting all of the latest news, getting
45440	48920	all of the latest apps, so we're really excited to have you on the show.
48920	49920	Yeah, thanks for having me.
49920	52920	I'm excited to nerd out and chat with you guys about this stuff.
52920	54760	We're excited to steal your brain for a minute.
54760	55760	Yeah.
55760	56760	Get all of your AI knowledge.
56920	61520	I thought we could start with this, which is, how did you start in the YouTube AI space?
61520	62960	How did you end up there?
62960	64200	What was the tip and point?
64200	65560	What were you doing before that?
65560	67400	Just give us a little bit of the context, the background.
67400	68400	Sure, yeah.
68400	71840	I've been doing digital marketing stuff since 2009.
71840	77640	I quit my day job, so to speak, back in 2009, and have been all in on content marketing
77640	78640	ever since.
78640	80160	My YouTube channel started in 2009.
80160	85880	I started blogging in 2009, and then over the years, I was just testing all sorts of
85880	87280	different things.
87280	90480	I had an online course around how to drive traffic.
90480	93080	I've had online courses around podcasting.
93080	97560	My first course that I ever sold was about how to build blogs, and so over the years,
97560	99600	I was just testing different courses.
99600	103680	I got really good at affiliate marketing, and most of my income over the last decade
103680	108240	has actually come from affiliate revenue, from promoting other products and my content,
108240	113400	and so I've just been surfing around in the world of digital marketing and course creation
113400	118120	and just playing with whatever would work, and I had a lot of good months and a lot of
118120	122040	bad months where I didn't know how I was going to pay the bills, and it was just kind of
122040	129600	throwing stuff at the wall all the way up until 2022 when the AI stuff started to pick
129600	130800	up some steam.
130800	137280	So at the time, I had a top 1% podcast with my co-host, Joe Fear, called Hustle and Flowchart.
137280	141760	He's actually still running that podcast to this day, but him and I were podcasting and
141760	145880	interviewing other digital marketers and things like that, and we started to have people
145880	150120	come on and talk about some of these newer technologies that were coming out.
150120	155200	One of the first ones we came across was Jasper, which was like an AI copywriting tool.
155200	158720	At the time, it was called Conversion AI, and then it was called something that Marvel
158720	163320	sued him for or wanted to sue him for, and then it eventually became Jasper, so I learned
163320	169040	about GPT-3, and we actually started making content about GPT-3 and Jasper and some of
169040	174480	these AI tools back in 2021, but nobody was really paying attention to AI back then.
174480	180400	Nobody really cared about it, and then about mid 2022, I made a video on my YouTube channel
180400	184840	about AI art and various AI art generators, and this was actually before Mid Journey came
184840	185840	out.
185840	190160	I was talking about Dolly and some of the stable diffusion stuff that was available, and that
190160	191360	video started to do well.
191360	195000	It got a few thousand views, and I went, oh, that's better than any of the other videos
195000	196000	I put out.
196000	197720	Maybe I'll do another video on AI.
197720	203040	I did a video about how to train your own face into the AI using a tool called DreamBoost,
203040	205640	so you can make AI images with your own likeness.
205640	211440	That video doubled my best video and had 15,000 views, and I went, okay, I'm going to keep
211440	214040	going down this AI path.
214040	218400	Then the video that really took off was when Chat GPT was released.
218400	223360	I made a video around Chat GPT, and then that one, I remember, I made that video.
223360	228200	I published it at 10 p.m. on a Tuesday or something, and then went to bed, woke up the
228200	232280	next morning, and that video had 60,000 views, and I went, oh, my God, this is the best video
232280	236920	I've ever done, and in 12 hours it got 60,000 views, and that video actually went on to do
236920	241560	over a million views over the course of the next two weeks.
241560	245160	That was sort of the pivot point where I went, I'm just going all in on AI.
245160	249360	Every video I make from here on out is going to be about the latest, coolest AI tools.
249360	250360	I'm going to make tutorials.
250360	251720	I'm going to talk about the news.
251760	256880	I'm going to talk about cool tools that I come across, and so ever since about October
256880	262320	of last year, every video I've released has just been about the coolest AI stuff that
262320	267600	I've built or come across or tutorials or things that I've learned how to do and just
267600	273640	shown it off, and that's been the last 10 months of my life of just making that content.
273640	277160	In that same time, I also built a website called Future Tools because I was coming across
277240	282720	all these AI tools, and I was struggling to sort of wrap my head around all these tools.
282720	286560	I was putting them into an Excel spreadsheet, but it got to a point where the Excel spreadsheet
286560	291280	had 100 rows in it, and I was kind of losing track of what did what, so I literally built
291280	295200	Future Tools as like a database for myself to kind of wrap my head around what tools
295200	297160	I've come across and what they do.
297160	301200	I shared that on Twitter, that got retweeted, it kind of went viral.
301200	306760	My Future Tools website blew up, and now it gets over a million views per month, so it's
307360	312080	the last 10 months have just been a roller coaster after over a decade of just kind of
312080	317200	trying different stuff and having little successes here and there, and now all of a sudden, this
317200	318600	is my life now.
318600	320440	That's the lesson for everybody watching, right?
320440	327200	This is the story time and time again, which is it takes years to build a quality of skills
327200	333200	that you can do something well, and then find the right fit of topic and audience for yourself
333200	335320	to really break out.
335560	338120	I think, Kieran, when you and I started this podcast, we were like, oh, it's going to take
338120	343440	us three to five years to make this thing big, real, like everything we want, and I
343440	347600	think that's the right timeline for anybody to consider, and the reason most people fail
347600	350240	is because they just don't do it long enough.
350240	354200	They don't get into it, and the other thing they don't do is they don't do what you did,
354200	356760	Matt, and pivot when they get the aha moment.
356760	360200	You woke up to that video, you had your aha moment, and you're like, all right, I know
360200	365040	what I'm doing now, and I'm okay leaving that stuff behind, and now I'm going in a new direction.
365080	368280	I think that's a really interesting point, like Matt, was it the same YouTube channel
368280	373160	you had since 2009, or so you're just grinding away and then pivoted to AI.
373160	376880	The other really important thing is, Matt, because you've been at this like 2009, you
376880	378600	mentioned affiliate, all of these things.
378600	380600	Did you ever hang out in the warrior form?
380600	384120	Back in the glorious, back in the day, when the warrior form was the warrior form.
384120	385120	Kieran loves the warrior form.
385120	389280	Yep, yep, I actually, one of my first products I ever sold was a WSO in the warrior form.
389280	390280	There you go.
390880	396840	That's where all the best people came from is the old school shady warrior form days.
398040	400520	Yep, that's where I originated back.
400520	404040	I remember back in 2007, when I was still working in my day job, I was working in a
404040	406840	manufacturing plant whenever the boss wasn't looking.
406840	410600	I was in the warrior form reading about various ways to make money online.
411400	411800	Let's go.
411800	416040	I was in there, getting my Frank Kearns, even page, all the copywriter stuff.
417000	421160	Also, and so I think, yeah, but I think coming back to Kearns point, people have two short
421160	425320	of time horizons on what success looks like, and they give up before they ever get started.
425320	428040	And like getting started is like a couple of years.
428040	429480	And that's where they kind of like give up.
429480	433240	I've actually seen studies where you can actually see like a most podcasters, most
433240	437080	people who blog, they kind of give up at a certain point in time and they give up ever
437080	440760	before they've actually even figured out what their thing is, like what their angle is,
440760	444360	what their topic is, what their kind of like area of expertise is going to be,
444360	445640	where their niche is going to be.
445640	446600	And so it's like super cool.
446600	449480	Like you just kept kind of iterating, kept trying to figure out like,
449480	451400	what was the thing that was going to resonate with your audience?
451400	453480	And you got one signal and you went all in.
453480	453880	For sure.
453880	454040	Yeah.
454040	458360	I mean, my thing has always kind of been, I nerd out about cool tools, right?
458360	461240	So back in the early days, when I first started my YouTube channel,
461240	462840	I was sharing different WordPress plugins.
462840	465000	I had a WordPress site and I was like, oh, check out this plugin.
465000	466280	It does this, check out this plugin.
466280	466840	It did this.
466840	470280	And then the first course that I ever sold was a course on WordPress.
470280	473000	And I was sharing various WordPress plugins.
473080	475640	So like the sort of common threads have always been,
475640	478760	I love making content and I love nerding out about cool tools.
478760	483640	It's just in 2022 when AI, all of these new tools started to flood the market.
483640	485160	It was kind of like, I found my home.
485160	488040	These are the tools that like I'm excited about,
488040	489960	but also the world is getting excited about.
490520	496040	It's incredible how much money or what kind of business you can build around cool tools.
496040	499400	Like I remember back in the day when I was like really leaning into search,
499960	503480	this guy was just obsessed by like Apple, Apple products,
503480	504920	like MacBooks in particular.
504920	508760	And just built this entire business, search business at the time,
508760	512360	like AdSense was like the cool thing to try to make money through.
512360	515720	And just own like every search term you could actually own through,
515720	517560	like all of these different search terms around MacBooks
517560	520280	and all of the kind of different laptops or computers that Apple had.
520280	524280	That dude brought in like millions, millions every year.
524280	526280	Like just with this site, didn't do anything about it.
526280	528920	So like finding niche, finding this topic is really important.
528920	531480	One thing I wanted to try out on you both is,
532040	533880	so Kip and I talk about this all the time.
534360	537720	We do some investing, talked to a lot of founders,
537720	539960	try to find like good spaces to invest in.
539960	543320	And so one of the things I've been doing on AI is trying to like map out
543320	545560	where I see a lot of the momentum right now,
545560	548360	like where I see a lot of the apps, where I'm having all the conversations.
548360	550600	And so I wanted to kind of map out where I see it,
550600	553160	let you all say whether there's things I'm missing,
553160	554280	things that you disagree with,
554280	556840	and then kind of like talk about where do we think the winners
556840	558040	or losers are going to appear from?
558120	560280	Like there's been basically where are the early winners
560280	561960	that we can go through, like the happy winners,
561960	563400	but I don't think they're going to be long-term winners
563400	565400	and where will the long-term winners come from?
566040	569640	The first are just like the kind of chat LLM models, right?
569640	571880	Chat, GBT, Bardee, Llama.
572760	575480	I don't know if you saw Facebook's latest release.
575480	576840	Actually, there's a company you probably know,
576840	578920	that's not because you know all things about AI tools,
578920	581880	but one of my favorite tools is like perplexity AI,
581880	582920	the kind of search engine.
582920	583960	And they released a chat bot
583960	586280	based upon Facebook's latest open source model,
586280	587640	which I thought was really cool.
587640	590120	But basically all of the like Entropic Clawed,
590120	592120	all of the different models like Poe.
592120	594200	The second, so that's like one batch, right?
594200	596200	And it's actually really hard to invest in that batch,
596200	597720	actually, because you don't see many of them
597720	599000	and like it's really hard to pick winners,
599000	600440	but we should talk about that batch.
600440	602360	The second is like the creative tools, right?
602360	605080	You mentioned Jasper was one of the very early tools,
605080	607960	the writing tools, the image tools, the video tools,
607960	610120	like Runway is an incredible video tool.
610120	612840	Image Journey is obviously one of the best image tools.
612840	614120	So that's a whole other space.
614680	617000	The third space for me is like B2B tools.
617480	618840	I don't know if you're seeing them or this, Kip.
618840	622600	Like, you know, AI CRMs, AI sales tools,
622600	624200	like all of the things you need to do.
624200	626680	A lot of it is actually the AI sales outreach tools,
626680	630120	right now, like sales tools, customer success tools,
630120	631240	customer support tools.
631240	633960	Like basically how you run a B2B go to market.
633960	636280	The fourth is data analysis, right?
636280	638280	We did a whole episode on code interpreter.
638280	640040	But then there's all of these other plugins
640040	643160	that can integrate to Excel, can integrate into Google Sheets,
643160	645000	can integrate into your data platform
645000	647480	and be able to provide a kind of chat layer
647480	648840	on top of that data.
648840	650760	The fifth is like knowledge work tools.
650760	652360	And so knowledge work tools were the one
652360	654680	that I talked a lot about at the start with you, Kip,
654680	658520	is like the hardest thing about fast growth companies
658520	660280	is that people get disconnected
660280	662920	from the core information that's important.
662920	664600	Like it just becomes really hard.
664600	666520	Slack, I think, is a really incredible tool
666520	667960	that actually makes this much worse,
667960	670200	where like it is hard to get a grasp
670200	672920	on all of the data churning through a company.
672920	674520	And so you have these kind of knowledge tools
674520	676280	that existing companies like a Glean,
676280	679080	like a chief knowledge officer, there's a Glean.
679080	680840	Two of my companies actually pivoted
680840	682600	to try to solve this problem recently.
682600	684760	There's a note taken tools for Zoom.
684760	686360	Like all of the tools you could have
686360	689000	to like keep a company much more efficient,
689000	691160	keep knowledge running through that company
691160	692280	in much more efficient ways.
692280	694440	And then there's all the productivity tools, right?
694440	696840	Like just like how we be more productive.
696840	700360	And so I want to like pause, let you all react to that.
700360	702520	What are categories you think that maybe I've missed
702520	703880	or they're the wrong categories?
703880	705640	What does that sound in terms of like
705640	706440	how we think about that today?
706440	707880	You're trying to figure out where to put some money.
707880	708920	Matt, tell me where to invest.
710760	711480	Please, Matt.
711480	712280	Please do it.
712280	714040	I'm like, well, the listeners get to benefit.
714040	715640	The viewers get to benefit.
715640	717000	Where should I put my dollars?
717000	718840	All right, I'll let Matt go first.
718840	719800	He's our guest here.
719800	721560	Yeah, so when it comes to that kind of stuff,
722520	725320	I tend to think that the best place to be
725320	727320	is the shovel sellers, right?
727320	729800	Like the NVIDIAs, the AMDs,
729800	733000	the companies that are benefiting no matter where.
733640	734920	Like what tools you're using.
734920	738760	I think Microsoft has a really, really smart plan, right?
738760	739720	What you just mentioned,
739720	743400	Perplexity is using Llama 2, which is Meta's platform.
743400	746200	Well, Meta just partnered with Microsoft
746200	749160	to release this Llama 2 platform, right?
749160	753160	Well, Microsoft also is partnered with OpenAI on ChatGPT.
753160	754360	So you look at that and they're like,
754360	757960	okay, didn't they just partner with two competing projects?
757960	760360	Well, one's closed source with the ChatGPT.
760360	762200	One's open source with Llama.
762200	764680	Well, the common denominator between those two
764680	769320	is they're both going to be using Microsoft's Azure servers, right?
769320	772040	So Microsoft is going to get the benefit
772040	774200	of people using the open source, the closed source,
774200	776840	because it's all going to be on the Azure servers, right?
776840	778520	And then NVIDIA, right?
778520	781800	NVIDIA makes all of the GPUs, all of the graphic cards,
781800	785320	all of the, pretty much all of these cloud compute systems
785320	787080	are using NVIDIA GPUs.
787080	789160	So NVIDIA is going to really benefit.
789160	791320	AMD is trying to get into the game.
791320	793640	So a lot of those are the types of tools
793640	796120	that I would really be wanting to look at.
796120	799240	I think my worry with a lot of the large language models,
799240	801880	with a lot of the image generation tools,
801880	804040	even the like new text to speech tools
804040	806600	that are coming out that are really, really, really good,
806600	810120	is there's open source models, there's closed source models,
810120	814440	there's APIs, there's no real moat on any of them, right?
814440	817960	Like anybody can go and build on top of Llama 2
818040	822600	and build a competitor to chat GPT and improve off of it
822600	824360	and build something even better.
824360	828520	Anybody can go and use an 11 Labs API,
828520	831000	which is a text to speech generator,
831000	834680	and go and build better and better text to speech tools.
835400	837960	Most of the AI art image generation tools,
837960	840360	they're either using stable diffusion under the hood,
840360	842520	or they're using Dolly under the hood.
842520	845560	So a lot of these tools, they just don't have that moat,
845560	849000	and it's just so easy for so many tools to pop up.
849000	850840	And so I feel like a lot of those platforms,
850840	852840	there's gonna be a bit of a race to the bottom
852840	855320	where you're gonna see companies pop up
855320	857720	and make a cheaper version that does the same thing,
857720	858920	and then another version that's cheaper
858920	859640	that does the same thing,
859640	861480	and eventually a version that's completely free,
861480	863720	but supported by ads everywhere.
863720	867800	So a lot of the models that are coming out now,
867800	871480	I would have a real concern about the long-term future of them,
871480	874600	just because of how much everything
874600	876120	seems to be moving to open source,
876120	880040	and how many available APIs are out there.
880040	883640	Well, look, I like that we're being your investment counsel,
883640	886840	and we're happy to be your CIOs today, Kieran.
886840	888200	Maybe you'll actually make some money,
888200	889640	and your companies won't go out of business.
892040	892920	Not saying that.
892920	894040	Shots fired.
894040	895640	But it's kind of what's happening.
896760	897880	Be but I turn.
901800	903240	But here's my take.
903320	905320	I agree with what's Matt saying.
905320	908520	In a world of whether you're an investor,
908520	911080	or you're a worker who wants to go work
911080	911960	at one of these companies,
911960	912760	or you're a buyer,
912760	915480	you're thinking about buying one of these tools,
915480	917880	I think there are two things to really consider
917880	919720	to understand where the big opportunity
919720	920920	long-term is gonna be,
920920	923000	and which is Matt touched on one,
923000	924120	which is distribution.
924120	926280	He touched on the other one, economics.
926280	928680	What is differentiated about this company
928680	932840	that's going to allow them to survive the long-term?
932840	936120	AMD and NVIDIA and all of the picks
936120	938120	and shovels kind of providers,
938120	940360	they're differentiated because the economics are great
940360	941640	because there's gonna be constant demand.
941640	943000	As the market goes up,
943000	945240	their economics are going to improve.
945240	947320	The other thing that they have is they're differentiated
947320	949000	because they have proprietary technology.
949960	953640	NVIDIA has its own way of manufacturing facilities,
953640	955400	everything of making its GPUs.
955400	957320	That's a really hard thing to do.
957320	958680	If you are just writing code
958680	961080	on top of somebody else's APIs,
961080	963160	that's not very differentiated.
963160	964600	And your economics are tough
964600	966440	because one, you're at the mercy
966440	968840	of whatever that API access costs.
968840	972200	And two, it's really hard for you to build a product
972200	973960	that is deep enough that provides enough value
973960	976040	that you don't have a lot of customer churn issues
976040	977720	where you have a lot of customers cancel.
977720	980200	And that's what we're seeing in the AI space right now
980200	981960	is a lot of customers canceling
981960	983400	and a lot of these companies dealing
983400	985880	with really massive churn issues,
985880	987640	especially given that the pace of innovation,
987640	990600	like Matt is on his YouTube channel all the time
990680	992200	talking about new stuff,
992200	994280	which means that like you could have a plan
994280	995720	and a model that's like obsolete.
995720	997320	Pace of innovation is crazy,
997320	999960	particularly because it's so much easier to build,
999960	1001160	like it takes three to five people
1001160	1002680	to build something that historically
1002680	1004040	has taken like 50 to 60 people.
1004040	1004920	This is my thesis.
1004920	1005800	Go picks and shovels.
1006360	1007720	Matt, I was what's app in here
1007720	1009160	and earlier today about an idea
1009160	1010360	that we're going to get your take on,
1010360	1012760	which is I think one of the winners
1012760	1014120	are very small businesses.
1015000	1016920	Because of AI and automation,
1016920	1019480	we're going to have more and more profitable,
1019480	1021800	more successful one to 10 employee businesses.
1022440	1024360	And if you are like me and believe that,
1024360	1026600	like I think there is a huge opportunity
1026600	1028440	for somebody to raise a venture fund
1028440	1031160	that all they do is invest in companies
1031160	1033960	that are providing AI, automation,
1033960	1036840	and tooling for that very small business category,
1036840	1040040	because the profitability of that category
1040040	1041560	is going to improve.
1041560	1044920	Traditionally, that's been a really hard category to serve
1044920	1046680	because there's a lot of business,
1046680	1048760	going out of business cancellation risk and everything.
1048760	1050520	I think that's going to change a lot.
1050520	1052600	The other category that you didn't include Kieran
1052600	1053960	that I would like to add,
1053960	1055880	and this is a hat tip to our friend Linus
1055880	1058120	who we had on the show recently,
1058120	1061480	he talked a lot about models operating on the edge.
1061480	1066120	So like having personalized models on your phone.
1066120	1068680	And like one of the most interesting things
1068680	1070440	that's happened this week is Rewind,
1070440	1074360	which is really awesome app to provide an AI layer across
1074360	1076120	basically everything you do on your computer,
1076120	1077720	just launched its iPhone app today.
1077720	1081320	And so now you can have this AI assistant on your iPhone
1081320	1082680	in a really powerful way,
1082680	1086200	in kind of this personal secure gesture data model
1086200	1088280	operating like on the edge on your phone.
1088280	1091080	And I think that is a category where
1091080	1092280	you're not going to have 100 winners,
1092280	1094200	but the handful of companies that win
1094200	1095640	are going to win pretty big.
1095640	1098200	You know what's one of the wildest thought exercises
1098200	1099960	for the three of us just to quickly touch on
1099960	1101560	in relation to this is,
1101560	1103080	if you told me like three months ago,
1103080	1104840	if you look at open AI, you would say,
1104920	1107800	wow, like open AI are going to be one of the biggest,
1107800	1111320	most profitable, biggest market cap businesses of all time.
1112040	1113960	Now I think open AI might be one of the most
1113960	1117960	interesting case studies in if distribution is truly a moat.
1118600	1120520	Because actually their core technology
1120520	1121960	is being eroded pretty rapidly.
1121960	1123640	I don't know what you think about that.
1123640	1125240	You agree or not, if you could like,
1125240	1126840	if you had 100,000 to invest,
1126840	1130200	are you putting that in like open AI today
1130200	1132680	or you think that their core business is
1133400	1135640	starting to be eroded by these open source models,
1135640	1138840	by like other companies just like replicating what they do.
1138840	1141640	You know, I think open AI is going to figure it out.
1141640	1144280	I think open AI has some of the smartest researchers
1144280	1145800	on the planet on their team.
1145800	1147720	So I do think that they're going to figure out
1148360	1151880	how to continually build more of a moat around their platform.
1151880	1155560	You know, some of the team that they have there behind the scenes,
1155560	1157080	I hate to try to pronounce their names.
1157800	1159560	Greg Brockman and some of the team there
1159560	1160920	are some of the people that are like,
1160920	1162520	you know, founding fathers of AI.
1162520	1163880	That have been doing this for a long time,
1163880	1165720	that are going to figure this stuff out.
1165720	1168280	So I do have faith in open AI.
1168280	1170280	If I had the money, I'd probably be putting it
1170280	1172040	more towards Microsoft and NVIDIA though,
1172040	1174200	because I think that's still the safer bet.
1174200	1177800	And Stan Lutman is an awesome, incredible founder.
1177800	1179480	So I think like part of it is,
1179480	1182840	the NVIDIA founder is an incredible founder.
1182840	1184200	Like if you've ever read up on that founder.
1184200	1185720	Oh yeah, Jen Simone, yep.
1185720	1187480	Yeah, what's really interesting about open AI,
1187480	1188760	like there was a really good tweet
1188760	1189960	about what Elon's doing at Twitter,
1189960	1192680	which is Elon is going through the biggest experiment
1192680	1195160	of all time to see if the only thing that truly matters
1195160	1196280	is like network effects.
1196280	1198360	Like, hey, getting rid of the brand,
1198360	1200120	getting rid of all of the actual users,
1200120	1201800	getting rid of all the things that people like.
1201800	1203720	But the thing he still has is network effects.
1203720	1204840	And if you have network effects,
1204840	1208120	like it's really an incredible moat and hard to disrupt.
1208120	1210920	And like open AI has not built network effects
1210920	1212200	into the product just yet,
1212200	1214120	but I do think part of your moat can just be
1214120	1216680	you have probably the best team in the industry
1216680	1218440	and like you'll figure out how to stay ahead.
1218440	1220520	But like the pace of evolution,
1220520	1222760	even in the kind of space that they're in,
1222760	1225000	like I don't even think I would have seen six months ago,
1225000	1227000	just how many competitors they have
1227000	1228360	in such a short amount of time.
1228360	1230360	Yeah, and open AI too, you know,
1230360	1232920	they're not just chat GPT, we have to remember, right?
1232920	1234200	They've also got Dolly.
1234200	1238280	They also have the GPT 3.5, the GPT4 APIs.
1238280	1240600	I mean, how many thousands and thousands of companies
1240600	1242760	are running with the GPT4 API?
1242760	1245800	I mean, I get a GPT4 API bill every month
1245800	1247800	just from playing around with it myself.
1247800	1251720	So, you know, I think that they have a lot more going for them
1251720	1252840	than just chat GPT.
1252840	1254760	I think the public sees chat GPT
1254760	1258040	and that's sort of what the public thinks of with open AI.
1258040	1261080	But they've got, you know, that sort of API business
1261080	1262440	behind the scenes that's powering
1262440	1264360	so many other companies as well.
1264360	1266360	What do you think happens in the kind of spaces
1266360	1267960	where it's like quick to replicate?
1267960	1270280	Because there is a need for these kind of like writing tools,
1270280	1272920	image tools, video tools, the sales outreach tools.
1272920	1276200	Like they are going to be incredibly important to companies.
1276200	1279240	I think every company is going to use some form of these tools.
1279240	1281800	But I wonder like how you win or is there a winner
1281800	1283800	or everyone just uses their own special flavor?
1283800	1285080	There's two things here.
1285080	1287000	There's two things that are part of it.
1287000	1290920	One of the things that are part of it is with chat GPT,
1290920	1294680	we're all getting trained on a chat kind of interface,
1294680	1296360	but more of a chat workflow
1296360	1299240	where you can have a lot of different types of actions
1299240	1300760	happening in one stream.
1301480	1303560	And we're going to all want that.
1303560	1304600	It's a way better experience.
1304600	1308120	You and I collaborated on a chat GPT thread care
1308120	1310440	and it was like, awesome, great experience.
1310440	1311720	We're all going to want to do that more.
1312360	1314680	In a world where that's true, you know who benefits?
1315320	1315960	Platforms.
1316520	1319480	People who have a wide set of use cases
1319480	1322120	that they can bundle into that new experience
1322120	1325400	and just basically put AI and that chat experience on.
1325400	1328440	So I think incumbents and platforms are really going to win.
1328440	1331000	And I think a lot of those point solutions right now,
1331560	1334360	it's going to be a little bit like .com bus 3.0.
1334440	1335720	Where they're just going,
1335720	1338120	like a couple will make it and the majority will not
1338120	1340360	because what they're doing will get gobbled up
1341000	1343160	by a lot of the existing incumbents.
1343720	1344360	Right.
1344360	1347400	Matt, what tool has like other than like the open AI
1347400	1349000	or the code interpreter.
1349000	1350360	Me and Kip had a moment,
1350360	1352520	we were doing like code interpreter live.
1352520	1355320	We were kind of doing stuff analysis for the podcast and RSS.
1355320	1356600	And I use these tools all the time,
1356600	1358040	but I hadn't read because I'm like,
1358040	1359320	maybe it's because I don't have any friends.
1360200	1362120	So I hadn't used the share and function
1362120	1364200	where like I'd shared this analysis with Kip.
1364200	1365560	But my analysis took me two hours.
1365560	1366680	Like I was going back and forth,
1366680	1368120	getting it to create charts,
1368120	1370440	getting it to like create tables, join tables,
1370440	1372440	then create charts on those join tables.
1372440	1375000	And I was like, this is like awesome, right?
1375000	1376840	Like I was like, this is super awesome.
1376840	1378920	But then I sent it to Kip and Kip,
1378920	1380760	you can just click on the share link.
1380760	1384200	You import that entire chat charts data
1384200	1386120	and then you can just start like building on top of it.
1386120	1387160	I didn't actually not,
1387160	1388600	I thought I was sending him like a thread
1388600	1390200	and he could see it and share it,
1390200	1391880	but I didn't know he could just easily start
1391880	1393560	to like rapidly iterate on that.
1393560	1394760	And I just blown my mind
1394760	1396520	because now you can just start to share these like
1397240	1399480	conversations and all this stuff with someone else
1399480	1401320	and they can just build on that really, really rapidly.
1401320	1403160	And that was like a bit of mind-blowing experience.
1403160	1404680	What's been a tool like that for you,
1404680	1406600	which you're just like, holy smokes,
1406600	1409560	like this is a whole new way to do things.
1410440	1411640	So there's been a couple.
1411640	1415480	I mean, so Anthropics Clawed 2 actually blew me away
1415480	1417640	when they first made it available
1417640	1421560	because of that 100,000 token context window,
1421560	1424040	meaning that you can essentially upload an entire book
1424040	1425880	and ask questions of that book, right?
1425880	1430600	You can copy an entire giant, 100,000
1430600	1432760	or 50,000 word article or something,
1432760	1434360	paste it in there, ask questions of it.
1434360	1436520	So Clawed 2 is really, really impressive.
1436520	1439960	I've actually started using Clawed 2 almost more than ChatGPT,
1439960	1442520	especially for summarization type stuff
1442520	1446120	and getting bullet points and helping me rewrite stuff.
1446120	1450440	But I think more, since that's sort of similar to ChatGPT,
1450440	1452440	I think the one tool that really blew my mind
1452440	1453880	when I did sort of a demo video on it
1453880	1455640	and I was sort of playing with it in real time,
1455640	1458520	that I really went, whoa, this is really crazy.
1458520	1459480	It was 11 Labs.
1459480	1461320	When I started playing with 11 Labs,
1461320	1464200	then I was able to train my own voice into 11 Labs
1464200	1467320	and then type in some text and then it spoke back to me.
1467320	1470520	I actually made a video of it on my YouTube channel
1470520	1472840	where I typed a bunch of words and had it speak back
1472840	1474040	and I was listening to it and I'm like,
1474120	1476440	yeah, I don't really think it sounds like me.
1476440	1477960	And then everybody on my YouTube channel,
1477960	1479400	all the comments were like,
1479400	1481160	I wasn't looking at my screen at that point
1481160	1482840	and I didn't realize you stopped talking.
1483720	1486120	Like I had some sort of cognitive dissonance from it
1486120	1489720	where I was like, that doesn't sound like me.
1489720	1492600	And everybody was like, no, that's you, that's your voice.
1492600	1494040	And then I started playing with it a little more
1494040	1497000	where I would take a voice from somebody from a podcast
1497000	1499400	and train it in there and see if I can replicate their voice.
1499400	1500440	And that was working.
1500440	1503320	And that to me was really, really mind blowing.
1503320	1505000	Also scary at the same time, right?
1505000	1507640	There's been a handful of scams that have popped up
1507640	1510760	where people have called somebody's parents
1510760	1512280	and then use somebody else's voice
1512280	1514040	to try to get money out of the parents.
1514040	1517000	And so it was one of the things where I played with it
1517000	1519480	for the first time and I went, this is mind blowing.
1519480	1520840	This is groundbreaking.
1520840	1522760	But also this scares the hell out of me.
1523400	1524680	Yeah, I watched that video.
1524680	1525880	I think it was around the time, Kip,
1525880	1530920	I watched you the Joe Rogan and Andrew Huberman fake podcast
1530920	1532920	when they actually were doing video
1532920	1535800	and then they out of the blue advertised
1535800	1537320	some sort of weight loss pills.
1538840	1541880	Hey, Joe, what do you think about aliens coming down
1541880	1543240	and they built the pyramids?
1543240	1544760	Like all the crazy stuff he talks about.
1544760	1546280	Oh, but what do you think about these weight loss pills?
1546280	1547160	Oh, they're super dope.
1548840	1551720	But still, wow, this stuff is going to come out
1551720	1553880	as pretty fast in terms of how rapidly
1553880	1557480	we're going to be able to do deepfakes and spoof people.
1557480	1558120	Absolutely.
1558120	1561080	All right, so Claude, 11 Labs, what else?
1561400	1564680	What else are your other favorite AI tools of 2023 so far?
1564680	1567640	So mid-journey, every time mid-journey releases a new update,
1567640	1568920	that just blows my mind.
1568920	1570120	Except for it's in Discord.
1572120	1574200	Are you a, you can't be a fan of the Discord experience.
1574200	1575880	Like why get out of the Discord?
1575880	1578120	Yeah, they are planning on getting out of the Discord.
1578120	1581160	In fact, if you've generated over, I think, 10,000 generations,
1581160	1583720	they let you use their web user interface.
1584680	1587240	But they are moving to a web interface,
1587240	1589960	but they're just, they're only letting certain beta testers
1589960	1590680	use it right now.
1590680	1591880	So it's getting there.
1591880	1593720	I also use Leonardo AI a lot,
1593720	1597240	which is another AI image generator that's really, really solid.
1597240	1600120	You can actually train your own sort of styles into it.
1600120	1601800	You can upload a whole bunch of images that you like,
1601800	1603240	and it will train on those styles,
1603240	1605640	and you can generate more images in that style.
1605640	1607000	So I like that one a lot.
1607000	1608520	You know, since I do a lot of YouTube videos,
1608520	1609720	I like to play with a lot of like,
1609720	1611080	create a video tools, right?
1611080	1613080	So I use RunwayML a lot.
1613080	1614920	I use a tool called Kyber a lot,
1614920	1618360	which makes really cool AI image generations.
1618360	1619800	It uses like Deforum,
1619800	1622120	and I think DiscoDiffusion behind the scenes.
1622120	1623640	I mean, there's just too many tools to list,
1623640	1625560	but there's, I play with a lot of like,
1625560	1627400	the visual effects type stuff,
1627400	1629400	because I'm constantly experimenting with,
1629400	1631640	what could I make that I can throw into a YouTube video
1631640	1632360	that make people go,
1632360	1634200	ooh, I need to know how he does that.
1634200	1638360	The video tools are the ones where you can have an avatar
1638360	1640200	within your, you're kind of go-to-market,
1640200	1642200	so you have an avatar on customer support,
1642200	1644680	or you have an avatar who's actually doing your sales,
1644680	1645720	and there's a company called Air,
1645720	1646520	they got a lot of traction,
1646520	1647720	but there's other companies doing this,
1647720	1649640	which is like, I can train it to sound like a human,
1649640	1651800	it can do the sales, it can do the customer support,
1651800	1654520	and it's like, they're like 80% there,
1654520	1656600	but that 80% is nowhere near good enough, right?
1656600	1657720	Like it's very monotone,
1657720	1660440	it's like, you know, the videos are just like,
1660440	1664360	well, this is me, I am speaking to you now,
1664360	1665400	like here, right?
1665400	1668520	Like they're just like, no tone, no personality.
1668520	1672040	I suspect that, I wonder how hard that 20% is gonna be.
1672040	1673320	I wonder if it's like one of those problems
1673320	1677640	where like the 20% is just like a huge jump up
1677640	1678680	from where we are today,
1678680	1680840	because video is like one of the,
1680840	1682360	I think most interesting spaces,
1682360	1684920	runway has probably one of the best tools,
1684920	1686920	but one of the ones I'm interested in is like,
1686920	1691160	how rapidly you can just have a person on support 24-7,
1691160	1692840	doing like your tweenshares,
1692840	1693720	how you can have someone,
1693720	1695960	your entire sales team like 24-7,
1695960	1699800	but it doesn't seem like we're close, it seems like.
1699800	1701640	I think the biggest problem with a lot of those tools
1701640	1703640	is honestly just the latency between
1703640	1704840	when you ask it the question,
1704840	1706600	and when it responds to the question, right?
1706680	1707560	Like you ask the question,
1707560	1708760	there's like a 10 second gap,
1708760	1710120	and then there's a response.
1710120	1712680	There are some companies that are figuring that out though.
1712680	1714120	There are some companies that,
1714120	1716920	I was talking to the CEO of a company called Convay,
1716920	1720440	who they're actually building this technology for video games,
1720440	1723960	where you can go up and speak into your microphone
1723960	1725800	with an NPC character,
1725800	1728520	and then the character sort of generates random,
1728520	1729880	real-time conversations.
1729880	1731640	So every time you play through the game,
1731640	1733800	you're gonna have different conversations
1733800	1735480	with that character, right?
1735480	1737560	So I could go up and ask them a question,
1737560	1739400	one play through, the second play through.
1739400	1740600	If I ask them the exact same question,
1740600	1741800	they're not gonna give me the same response
1741800	1743400	because it's all generated with AI.
1743400	1747080	Well, his program actually fixed that latency issue
1747080	1749160	where it actually has this sort of like
1749160	1750680	a buffer type thing built in,
1750680	1752280	where as I'm speaking,
1752280	1753480	while it's hearing these words,
1753480	1755240	it's already processing the words,
1755240	1757400	and then when I finally pause,
1757400	1760120	it's already processed the first part of what I said
1760120	1761960	and is ready to respond.
1761960	1763240	So they've actually figured it out
1763240	1765480	where the gap between what I say
1765480	1769080	and what they respond with is milliseconds.
1769080	1771160	So it's, I mean, it's getting really, really close.
1771160	1773080	And then with tools like 11 Labs,
1773080	1774840	I feel like all those tools need to do
1774840	1777800	to get rid of that sort of robotic response voice
1777800	1781000	is just tie into like an API, like 11 Labs API.
1781000	1782680	And now you've got a voice that sounds
1782680	1785800	just like a real human that's almost indistinguishable.
1785800	1789320	And then combine that with a tool like Synthesia
1789320	1790120	or something like that,
1790120	1792520	that actually puts that sort of human-looking avatar
1792600	1793480	in front of you.
1793480	1795240	So it looks like they're speaking to you
1795240	1797800	and now we're crossing that unkindly valley
1797800	1800840	and we've got somebody that is having a conversation,
1800840	1803480	sounds like a real voice and is responding in real time.
1803480	1805800	It's just the technologies all exist.
1805800	1808360	I haven't just seen one tool pull them all together
1808360	1811880	into a single purpose built tool for like sales.
1811880	1814520	Back in my software engineer days,
1814520	1816680	one of the interviews I went for like very early
1816680	1819320	at a college, the person who was interviewing me
1819320	1822520	like ran the entire software development department.
1822520	1826200	And he purposely, and he told me like afterwards
1826200	1827800	this is part of his interview style,
1827800	1832120	he purposely waited 20 seconds between asking a question,
1832120	1833800	you answering and him responding.
1833800	1837320	So he would leave like 20 seconds of uncomfortable silence.
1837320	1839400	And he said he reason, and he would just sit there like,
1839400	1841240	and he would nod his head for some reason and just like,
1842200	1844440	and you're like, oh, I think the reason he was like,
1844440	1848520	I do that because it's incredible how people decide to like fill
1848520	1849960	that 20 seconds.
1849960	1851880	They just say like, you know,
1851880	1854200	they just say like totally insane stuff.
1854200	1858120	But I'm like, okay, like, but it's not a normal situation
1858120	1859960	that I'm going to have to deal with as a software engineer.
1859960	1862040	Where like part of me being a great software engineer
1862040	1863960	has been able to deal with like 20 seconds,
1863960	1866840	specifically 20 seconds of like uncomfortable silence.
1866840	1869640	So I still think he would actually do pretty well as like
1869640	1872680	an AI avatar or sales person.
1872680	1874520	Yeah, yeah, I hear they do that on Shark Tank too,
1874520	1875720	just to see how people respond.
1876600	1879480	Yeah, I mean, yeah, once AI starts playing mental games with us,
1879480	1880200	then we're all screwed.
1882520	1885240	It's like, oh, come on, man, I can't deal with that.
1885240	1887400	I can barely deal with it from other humans.
1887400	1888760	Right, right.
1888760	1891320	The last one I want to touch on both of you is
1891320	1893080	this is actually Paris seems to be a real hub
1893080	1893880	of these kind of companies.
1893880	1898040	We talked about it, which is it feels like most companies,
1898040	1903000	most large companies will have a plug and play version of a AI,
1903000	1905160	like an LLM model just for them, right?
1905160	1907000	Like you'll be able to plug in your data.
1907000	1909320	You'll be able to like customize it for your needs.
1909320	1911480	And I suspect at some point, like you'll just be able to go
1912280	1915720	any kind of podcast or any YouTuber can go to a service,
1915720	1918120	pay a couple of bucks, put their RSS feed,
1918120	1921160	and get some like models back and be able to build apps on top of that.
1921720	1922680	Are you seeing much of that?
1922680	1924200	Like how do you feel about that?
1924200	1926840	How do both of you think that's going to be a pretty big,
1926840	1928200	a big important space?
1928200	1931240	Yeah, I mean, I'm already seeing that kind of stuff that already exists.
1931240	1934200	I mean, there's already apps out there that have, you know,
1934200	1936840	scraped the entire Huberman Labs podcast.
1936840	1940040	And you can go and have conversations with Andrew Huberman
1940040	1944040	based on all of the conversations he's had on his podcast already.
1944040	1945400	That sort of already exists.
1945400	1949960	There's a tool that I spoke with the founder called personal.ai.
1949960	1954440	And what that tool is, is you can actually plug in your own blogs, RSS feed.
1954440	1956040	You can plug in your Twitter account.
1956040	1959880	You can, you know, personally journal directly inside of the app.
1959880	1963240	And what it does is it learns more and more and more about you.
1963320	1966200	And then you can go in there and have conversations with it.
1966200	1970840	And based on all of your own data, it will know how you would respond.
1970840	1975880	But then you can also go and give a front end user interface to other people.
1975880	1979480	So people can have a conversation with virtual digital me.
1979480	1984040	Like that's already out there and there's a handful of tools that do that.
1984040	1985880	I think we're going to see that more and more.
1985880	1989560	I mean, I think that's probably more likely the future of customer service, right?
1989560	1996680	Where you've got these AI models that are trained on all of the database of user documentation.
1996680	2001800	They're trained on all of past customer support conversations and how the response was handled.
2001800	2008280	And then over time, these AI bots are going to be able to handle 98.9% of the conversations
2008280	2013400	that come through without ever needing to, you know, touch a human customer support rep.
2013400	2015880	So that I think is coming really fast.
2015880	2020040	I think that's sort of the next wave that we're going to see a lot of, honestly.
2020040	2023480	Well, yeah. And it's like, when we talk about customer support,
2023480	2026760	the reason I think this is important, because Kieran, I'm about to bring up
2026760	2031480	one of the AI startups that you and I are most confused by to get Matt's take on.
2032120	2035320	But this is me rationalizing why they might exist.
2035320	2039720	You know, when we talk about, oh, AI is going to solve customer support or it's going to solve sales.
2039720	2045080	The reality is humans like to interact with different types of people in those situations.
2045080	2049160	Like some people want a salesperson who's really to the point.
2049160	2054040	Others want somebody who's just going to be very detail oriented, et cetera.
2054040	2057560	Right. And that's come, that's where you're not just going to need like one model.
2057560	2063560	You're going to need very specific versions of a model to solve the audience you're trying to address.
2063560	2066600	And maybe, maybe that's why character.ai exists.
2067160	2068200	I don't really understand.
2068200	2069000	Yeah, I don't understand.
2069000	2071400	Yeah, this is a good, like what am I missing?
2071400	2072440	What am I missing?
2072440	2073000	What am I missing?
2073240	2078200	So much money and like, it seems like people are making some weird characters,
2078200	2081240	but like, are we, are we missing something about character?
2081240	2087640	This is like, I feel like I'm, you know, the person watching these humans act like NPC people
2087640	2093400	on TikTok doing gang gang ice cream, getting the dollars in, like, I feel that way about
2093400	2096520	characters that I know, like, I'm really into the AI space.
2096520	2100520	I'm like, I don't, I don't get the, I don't, what, what is this company doing?
2100520	2101960	Why are they going to be huge success?
2101960	2103240	Yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm with you.
2103240	2105640	I don't totally understand character AI.
2105640	2106840	Here's what I will say though.
2106840	2113160	I do have two kids, like they're both like sort of preteen age kids and they, for whatever
2113160	2114680	reason, love character AI.
2114680	2117560	Like them on their phone or on the desktop.
2117560	2118280	This is a part of that.
2118280	2119080	I just knew I was old.
2119080	2120840	So they've got their, they've got their Chromebooks.
2120840	2125320	Both my kids have little Chromebooks and they get into character AI and like,
2125320	2127880	we have a neighbor across the street that's the same age.
2127880	2134280	And apparently among like their age kids, like middle school age kids, they love this
2134280	2137000	sort of like fun digital companion thing.
2137000	2139640	It's like, it's like the new Tomagachi kind of thing, right?
2139640	2140360	Oh, wow.
2140360	2145880	That sort of generation seems to just be obsessed with this digital companion
2145880	2147400	conversation type app.
2148040	2149720	That's what I've noticed about it.
2149720	2153480	That's the only sort of justification I can make towards character AI.
2153480	2157240	I've played with it like once or twice and went, all right, I, you know,
2157240	2159000	I just had a conversation with Mega Man.
2159000	2159960	That, that was cool.
2160520	2161880	I don't know what else to do with this.
2161880	2162760	I love Mega Man.
2162760	2164680	But my kids like, they love it.
2164680	2167880	They're on character AI all the time, which is scary.
2167880	2170920	Hopefully that doesn't ruin, you know, real relationships and real
2170920	2172200	companionship with humans.
2172200	2176200	Hopefully it doesn't ruin like social skills and interpersonal skills and all the
2176200	2177960	things we actually need as a society.
2177960	2178360	Oh yeah.
2178360	2182520	That's a whole other rabbit hole that sort of scares me about AI is the whole digital
2182520	2186440	girlfriend thing that's starting to pop up where people are building relationships and
2186520	2190280	not feeling the need to have real relationships with, you know, the opposite sex
2190280	2194040	in real life because they've got their digital like, but that's a whole rabbit hole.
2195640	2197720	That's how population continues to decline.
2197720	2198200	Exactly.
2198200	2199800	They're $1 billion valuation.
2199800	2204440	So now we know they've, they've climbed the charts because Mega Man is on there.
2204440	2206040	I think Mega Man is kind of dope.
2206680	2209000	So I think that's, I think, I think that's a good case for them.
2209000	2211160	They're also, and Andres and Howard's back.
2211160	2213160	Matt, it's been incredible having you on the show.
2213160	2214120	We're both big fans.
2214120	2216360	We watch your YouTube channel.
2216360	2219080	Everyone who's listening to this should go check out your YouTube channel.
2219080	2221160	Keep up the date with AI every single week.
2221160	2223640	And we really appreciate you coming on and spending this time with us.
2223640	2223880	Yeah.
2223880	2224520	Thanks for having me on.
2224520	2226200	This has been absolutely a blast.
2226200	2227080	I've had a good time.
2228360	2230440	This data is wrong every freaking time.
2231320	2232280	Have you heard of HubSpot?
2233480	2236680	HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated.
2236680	2237000	Whoa.
2237000	2238680	I can see the clients' whole history.
2238680	2243240	Calls, support tickets, emails, and here's a test from three days ago.
2243240	2244360	I totally missed.
2245480	2247240	HubSpot, grow better.
