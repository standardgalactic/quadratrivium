1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
On this episode of Marketing Against the Green, we talked to Matt Wolf.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,800
Matt has one of the biggest and best YouTube channels, all about AI, and so we had to talk

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,720
to Matt all about apps and tools.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,120
We get into the biggest AI winners, the biggest AI losers, and who are going to be the biggest

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,680
AI apps in the future?

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,720
Where should you invest your money?

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,800
I'm Kieran Flanagan, the CMO at Zapier.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,600
I'm here always with my co-host, Kip Bonner, the CMO at HubSpot.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,600
Let's get into it.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:40,520
Okay, Matt, it is great to have you on the show.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,440
I've spent a lot of hours watching your YouTube channel, getting all of the latest news, getting

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,920
all of the latest apps, so we're really excited to have you on the show.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Yeah, thanks for having me.

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,920
I'm excited to nerd out and chat with you guys about this stuff.

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,760
We're excited to steal your brain for a minute.

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,760
Yeah.

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,760
Get all of your AI knowledge.

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,520
I thought we could start with this, which is, how did you start in the YouTube AI space?

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,960
How did you end up there?

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,200
What was the tip and point?

21
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,560
What were you doing before that?

22
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,400
Just give us a little bit of the context, the background.

23
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
Sure, yeah.

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,840
I've been doing digital marketing stuff since 2009.

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,640
I quit my day job, so to speak, back in 2009, and have been all in on content marketing

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,640
ever since.

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,160
My YouTube channel started in 2009.

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,880
I started blogging in 2009, and then over the years, I was just testing all sorts of

29
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,280
different things.

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,480
I had an online course around how to drive traffic.

31
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,080
I've had online courses around podcasting.

32
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,560
My first course that I ever sold was about how to build blogs, and so over the years,

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,600
I was just testing different courses.

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,680
I got really good at affiliate marketing, and most of my income over the last decade

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,240
has actually come from affiliate revenue, from promoting other products and my content,

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,400
and so I've just been surfing around in the world of digital marketing and course creation

37
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,120
and just playing with whatever would work, and I had a lot of good months and a lot of

38
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,040
bad months where I didn't know how I was going to pay the bills, and it was just kind of

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:09,600
throwing stuff at the wall all the way up until 2022 when the AI stuff started to pick

40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,800
up some steam.

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,280
So at the time, I had a top 1% podcast with my co-host, Joe Fear, called Hustle and Flowchart.

42
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,760
He's actually still running that podcast to this day, but him and I were podcasting and

43
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,880
interviewing other digital marketers and things like that, and we started to have people

44
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,120
come on and talk about some of these newer technologies that were coming out.

45
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,200
One of the first ones we came across was Jasper, which was like an AI copywriting tool.

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,720
At the time, it was called Conversion AI, and then it was called something that Marvel

47
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,320
sued him for or wanted to sue him for, and then it eventually became Jasper, so I learned

48
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:49,040
about GPT-3, and we actually started making content about GPT-3 and Jasper and some of

49
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,480
these AI tools back in 2021, but nobody was really paying attention to AI back then.

50
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,400
Nobody really cared about it, and then about mid 2022, I made a video on my YouTube channel

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,840
about AI art and various AI art generators, and this was actually before Mid Journey came

52
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
out.

53
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,160
I was talking about Dolly and some of the stable diffusion stuff that was available, and that

54
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,360
video started to do well.

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,000
It got a few thousand views, and I went, oh, that's better than any of the other videos

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I put out.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,720
Maybe I'll do another video on AI.

58
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,040
I did a video about how to train your own face into the AI using a tool called DreamBoost,

59
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,640
so you can make AI images with your own likeness.

60
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,440
That video doubled my best video and had 15,000 views, and I went, okay, I'm going to keep

61
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,040
going down this AI path.

62
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,400
Then the video that really took off was when Chat GPT was released.

63
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,360
I made a video around Chat GPT, and then that one, I remember, I made that video.

64
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,200
I published it at 10 p.m. on a Tuesday or something, and then went to bed, woke up the

65
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,280
next morning, and that video had 60,000 views, and I went, oh, my God, this is the best video

66
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,920
I've ever done, and in 12 hours it got 60,000 views, and that video actually went on to do

67
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,560
over a million views over the course of the next two weeks.

68
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,160
That was sort of the pivot point where I went, I'm just going all in on AI.

69
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,360
Every video I make from here on out is going to be about the latest, coolest AI tools.

70
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
I'm going to make tutorials.

71
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,720
I'm going to talk about the news.

72
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,880
I'm going to talk about cool tools that I come across, and so ever since about October

73
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,320
of last year, every video I've released has just been about the coolest AI stuff that

74
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,600
I've built or come across or tutorials or things that I've learned how to do and just

75
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,640
shown it off, and that's been the last 10 months of my life of just making that content.

76
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,160
In that same time, I also built a website called Future Tools because I was coming across

77
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,720
all these AI tools, and I was struggling to sort of wrap my head around all these tools.

78
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,560
I was putting them into an Excel spreadsheet, but it got to a point where the Excel spreadsheet

79
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,280
had 100 rows in it, and I was kind of losing track of what did what, so I literally built

80
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,200
Future Tools as like a database for myself to kind of wrap my head around what tools

81
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,160
I've come across and what they do.

82
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,200
I shared that on Twitter, that got retweeted, it kind of went viral.

83
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,760
My Future Tools website blew up, and now it gets over a million views per month, so it's

84
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,080
the last 10 months have just been a roller coaster after over a decade of just kind of

85
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,200
trying different stuff and having little successes here and there, and now all of a sudden, this

86
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,600
is my life now.

87
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,440
That's the lesson for everybody watching, right?

88
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:27,200
This is the story time and time again, which is it takes years to build a quality of skills

89
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,200
that you can do something well, and then find the right fit of topic and audience for yourself

90
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,320
to really break out.

91
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,120
I think, Kieran, when you and I started this podcast, we were like, oh, it's going to take

92
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,440
us three to five years to make this thing big, real, like everything we want, and I

93
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,600
think that's the right timeline for anybody to consider, and the reason most people fail

94
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,240
is because they just don't do it long enough.

95
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,200
They don't get into it, and the other thing they don't do is they don't do what you did,

96
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,760
Matt, and pivot when they get the aha moment.

97
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,200
You woke up to that video, you had your aha moment, and you're like, all right, I know

98
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,040
what I'm doing now, and I'm okay leaving that stuff behind, and now I'm going in a new direction.

99
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,280
I think that's a really interesting point, like Matt, was it the same YouTube channel

100
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,160
you had since 2009, or so you're just grinding away and then pivoted to AI.

101
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,880
The other really important thing is, Matt, because you've been at this like 2009, you

102
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,600
mentioned affiliate, all of these things.

103
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
Did you ever hang out in the warrior form?

104
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,120
Back in the glorious, back in the day, when the warrior form was the warrior form.

105
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
Kieran loves the warrior form.

106
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,280
Yep, yep, I actually, one of my first products I ever sold was a WSO in the warrior form.

107
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
There you go.

108
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,840
That's where all the best people came from is the old school shady warrior form days.

109
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,520
Yep, that's where I originated back.

110
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,040
I remember back in 2007, when I was still working in my day job, I was working in a

111
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,840
manufacturing plant whenever the boss wasn't looking.

112
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,600
I was in the warrior form reading about various ways to make money online.

113
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:51,800
Let's go.

114
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,040
I was in there, getting my Frank Kearns, even page, all the copywriter stuff.

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,160
Also, and so I think, yeah, but I think coming back to Kearns point, people have two short

116
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,320
of time horizons on what success looks like, and they give up before they ever get started.

117
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,040
And like getting started is like a couple of years.

118
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,480
And that's where they kind of like give up.

119
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,240
I've actually seen studies where you can actually see like a most podcasters, most

120
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,080
people who blog, they kind of give up at a certain point in time and they give up ever

121
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,760
before they've actually even figured out what their thing is, like what their angle is,

122
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,360
what their topic is, what their kind of like area of expertise is going to be,

123
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,640
where their niche is going to be.

124
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,600
And so it's like super cool.

125
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,480
Like you just kept kind of iterating, kept trying to figure out like,

126
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,400
what was the thing that was going to resonate with your audience?

127
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,480
And you got one signal and you went all in.

128
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:33,880
For sure.

129
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,040
Yeah.

130
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,360
I mean, my thing has always kind of been, I nerd out about cool tools, right?

131
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,240
So back in the early days, when I first started my YouTube channel,

132
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,840
I was sharing different WordPress plugins.

133
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,000
I had a WordPress site and I was like, oh, check out this plugin.

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,280
It does this, check out this plugin.

135
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,840
It did this.

136
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,280
And then the first course that I ever sold was a course on WordPress.

137
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,000
And I was sharing various WordPress plugins.

138
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,640
So like the sort of common threads have always been,

139
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,760
I love making content and I love nerding out about cool tools.

140
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,640
It's just in 2022 when AI, all of these new tools started to flood the market.

141
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,160
It was kind of like, I found my home.

142
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,040
These are the tools that like I'm excited about,

143
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,960
but also the world is getting excited about.

144
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:16,040
It's incredible how much money or what kind of business you can build around cool tools.

145
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,400
Like I remember back in the day when I was like really leaning into search,

146
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,480
this guy was just obsessed by like Apple, Apple products,

147
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,920
like MacBooks in particular.

148
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,760
And just built this entire business, search business at the time,

149
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,360
like AdSense was like the cool thing to try to make money through.

150
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,720
And just own like every search term you could actually own through,

151
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,560
like all of these different search terms around MacBooks

152
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:40,280
and all of the kind of different laptops or computers that Apple had.

153
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,280
That dude brought in like millions, millions every year.

154
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,280
Like just with this site, didn't do anything about it.

155
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,920
So like finding niche, finding this topic is really important.

156
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,480
One thing I wanted to try out on you both is,

157
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,880
so Kip and I talk about this all the time.

158
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,720
We do some investing, talked to a lot of founders,

159
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,960
try to find like good spaces to invest in.

160
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,320
And so one of the things I've been doing on AI is trying to like map out

161
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,560
where I see a lot of the momentum right now,

162
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,360
like where I see a lot of the apps, where I'm having all the conversations.

163
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,600
And so I wanted to kind of map out where I see it,

164
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,160
let you all say whether there's things I'm missing,

165
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,280
things that you disagree with,

166
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,840
and then kind of like talk about where do we think the winners

167
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,040
or losers are going to appear from?

168
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,280
Like there's been basically where are the early winners

169
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,960
that we can go through, like the happy winners,

170
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,400
but I don't think they're going to be long-term winners

171
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
and where will the long-term winners come from?

172
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,640
The first are just like the kind of chat LLM models, right?

173
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,880
Chat, GBT, Bardee, Llama.

174
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,480
I don't know if you saw Facebook's latest release.

175
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,840
Actually, there's a company you probably know,

176
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,920
that's not because you know all things about AI tools,

177
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,880
but one of my favorite tools is like perplexity AI,

178
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,920
the kind of search engine.

179
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,960
And they released a chat bot

180
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,280
based upon Facebook's latest open source model,

181
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,640
which I thought was really cool.

182
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,120
But basically all of the like Entropic Clawed,

183
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,120
all of the different models like Poe.

184
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,200
The second, so that's like one batch, right?

185
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
And it's actually really hard to invest in that batch,

186
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,720
actually, because you don't see many of them

187
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,000
and like it's really hard to pick winners,

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,440
but we should talk about that batch.

189
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,360
The second is like the creative tools, right?

190
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,080
You mentioned Jasper was one of the very early tools,

191
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,960
the writing tools, the image tools, the video tools,

192
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,120
like Runway is an incredible video tool.

193
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,840
Image Journey is obviously one of the best image tools.

194
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,120
So that's a whole other space.

195
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,000
The third space for me is like B2B tools.

196
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,840
I don't know if you're seeing them or this, Kip.

197
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,600
Like, you know, AI CRMs, AI sales tools,

198
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,200
like all of the things you need to do.

199
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,680
A lot of it is actually the AI sales outreach tools,

200
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,120
right now, like sales tools, customer success tools,

201
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,240
customer support tools.

202
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,960
Like basically how you run a B2B go to market.

203
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,280
The fourth is data analysis, right?

204
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,280
We did a whole episode on code interpreter.

205
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,040
But then there's all of these other plugins

206
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,160
that can integrate to Excel, can integrate into Google Sheets,

207
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,000
can integrate into your data platform

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,480
and be able to provide a kind of chat layer

209
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,840
on top of that data.

210
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,760
The fifth is like knowledge work tools.

211
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,360
And so knowledge work tools were the one

212
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,680
that I talked a lot about at the start with you, Kip,

213
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,520
is like the hardest thing about fast growth companies

214
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,280
is that people get disconnected

215
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,920
from the core information that's important.

216
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,600
Like it just becomes really hard.

217
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,520
Slack, I think, is a really incredible tool

218
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,960
that actually makes this much worse,

219
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,200
where like it is hard to get a grasp

220
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,920
on all of the data churning through a company.

221
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,520
And so you have these kind of knowledge tools

222
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,280
that existing companies like a Glean,

223
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,080
like a chief knowledge officer, there's a Glean.

224
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,840
Two of my companies actually pivoted

225
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,600
to try to solve this problem recently.

226
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,760
There's a note taken tools for Zoom.

227
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,360
Like all of the tools you could have

228
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,000
to like keep a company much more efficient,

229
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,160
keep knowledge running through that company

230
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,280
in much more efficient ways.

231
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,440
And then there's all the productivity tools, right?

232
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,840
Like just like how we be more productive.

233
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,360
And so I want to like pause, let you all react to that.

234
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,520
What are categories you think that maybe I've missed

235
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,880
or they're the wrong categories?

236
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,640
What does that sound in terms of like

237
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,440
how we think about that today?

238
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,880
You're trying to figure out where to put some money.

239
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,920
Matt, tell me where to invest.

240
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,480
Please, Matt.

241
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,280
Please do it.

242
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,040
I'm like, well, the listeners get to benefit.

243
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,640
The viewers get to benefit.

244
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,000
Where should I put my dollars?

245
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,840
All right, I'll let Matt go first.

246
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,800
He's our guest here.

247
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,560
Yeah, so when it comes to that kind of stuff,

248
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,320
I tend to think that the best place to be

249
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
is the shovel sellers, right?

250
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,800
Like the NVIDIAs, the AMDs,

251
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,000
the companies that are benefiting no matter where.

252
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,920
Like what tools you're using.

253
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,760
I think Microsoft has a really, really smart plan, right?

254
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,720
What you just mentioned,

255
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,400
Perplexity is using Llama 2, which is Meta's platform.

256
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,200
Well, Meta just partnered with Microsoft

257
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,160
to release this Llama 2 platform, right?

258
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,160
Well, Microsoft also is partnered with OpenAI on ChatGPT.

259
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,360
So you look at that and they're like,

260
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,960
okay, didn't they just partner with two competing projects?

261
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,360
Well, one's closed source with the ChatGPT.

262
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,200
One's open source with Llama.

263
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,680
Well, the common denominator between those two

264
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,320
is they're both going to be using Microsoft's Azure servers, right?

265
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,040
So Microsoft is going to get the benefit

266
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,200
of people using the open source, the closed source,

267
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,840
because it's all going to be on the Azure servers, right?

268
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,520
And then NVIDIA, right?

269
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,800
NVIDIA makes all of the GPUs, all of the graphic cards,

270
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,320
all of the, pretty much all of these cloud compute systems

271
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,080
are using NVIDIA GPUs.

272
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,160
So NVIDIA is going to really benefit.

273
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,320
AMD is trying to get into the game.

274
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,640
So a lot of those are the types of tools

275
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,120
that I would really be wanting to look at.

276
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,240
I think my worry with a lot of the large language models,

277
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,880
with a lot of the image generation tools,

278
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,040
even the like new text to speech tools

279
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,600
that are coming out that are really, really, really good,

280
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,120
is there's open source models, there's closed source models,

281
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,440
there's APIs, there's no real moat on any of them, right?

282
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,960
Like anybody can go and build on top of Llama 2

283
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,600
and build a competitor to chat GPT and improve off of it

284
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,360
and build something even better.

285
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,520
Anybody can go and use an 11 Labs API,

286
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,000
which is a text to speech generator,

287
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,680
and go and build better and better text to speech tools.

288
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,960
Most of the AI art image generation tools,

289
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,360
they're either using stable diffusion under the hood,

290
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,520
or they're using Dolly under the hood.

291
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,560
So a lot of these tools, they just don't have that moat,

292
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,000
and it's just so easy for so many tools to pop up.

293
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,840
And so I feel like a lot of those platforms,

294
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,840
there's gonna be a bit of a race to the bottom

295
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,320
where you're gonna see companies pop up

296
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,720
and make a cheaper version that does the same thing,

297
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,920
and then another version that's cheaper

298
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,640
that does the same thing,

299
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,480
and eventually a version that's completely free,

300
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,720
but supported by ads everywhere.

301
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,800
So a lot of the models that are coming out now,

302
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,480
I would have a real concern about the long-term future of them,

303
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,600
just because of how much everything

304
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,120
seems to be moving to open source,

305
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,040
and how many available APIs are out there.

306
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,640
Well, look, I like that we're being your investment counsel,

307
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,840
and we're happy to be your CIOs today, Kieran.

308
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,200
Maybe you'll actually make some money,

309
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,640
and your companies won't go out of business.

310
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,920
Not saying that.

311
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,040
Shots fired.

312
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,640
But it's kind of what's happening.

313
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,880
Be but I turn.

314
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,240
But here's my take.

315
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
I agree with what's Matt saying.

316
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,520
In a world of whether you're an investor,

317
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,080
or you're a worker who wants to go work

318
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,960
at one of these companies,

319
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,760
or you're a buyer,

320
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,480
you're thinking about buying one of these tools,

321
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,880
I think there are two things to really consider

322
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,720
to understand where the big opportunity

323
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,920
long-term is gonna be,

324
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,000
and which is Matt touched on one,

325
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,120
which is distribution.

326
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,280
He touched on the other one, economics.

327
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,680
What is differentiated about this company

328
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,840
that's going to allow them to survive the long-term?

329
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,120
AMD and NVIDIA and all of the picks

330
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
and shovels kind of providers,

331
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,360
they're differentiated because the economics are great

332
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,640
because there's gonna be constant demand.

333
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,000
As the market goes up,

334
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,240
their economics are going to improve.

335
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,320
The other thing that they have is they're differentiated

336
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,000
because they have proprietary technology.

337
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,640
NVIDIA has its own way of manufacturing facilities,

338
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,400
everything of making its GPUs.

339
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,320
That's a really hard thing to do.

340
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,680
If you are just writing code

341
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,080
on top of somebody else's APIs,

342
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,160
that's not very differentiated.

343
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,600
And your economics are tough

344
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,440
because one, you're at the mercy

345
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,840
of whatever that API access costs.

346
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,200
And two, it's really hard for you to build a product

347
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,960
that is deep enough that provides enough value

348
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,040
that you don't have a lot of customer churn issues

349
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,720
where you have a lot of customers cancel.

350
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,200
And that's what we're seeing in the AI space right now

351
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,960
is a lot of customers canceling

352
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,400
and a lot of these companies dealing

353
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,880
with really massive churn issues,

354
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,640
especially given that the pace of innovation,

355
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,600
like Matt is on his YouTube channel all the time

356
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,200
talking about new stuff,

357
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,280
which means that like you could have a plan

358
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,720
and a model that's like obsolete.

359
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,320
Pace of innovation is crazy,

360
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,960
particularly because it's so much easier to build,

361
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,160
like it takes three to five people

362
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,680
to build something that historically

363
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,040
has taken like 50 to 60 people.

364
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,920
This is my thesis.

365
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,800
Go picks and shovels.

366
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,720
Matt, I was what's app in here

367
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,160
and earlier today about an idea

368
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,360
that we're going to get your take on,

369
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,760
which is I think one of the winners

370
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,120
are very small businesses.

371
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,920
Because of AI and automation,

372
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,480
we're going to have more and more profitable,

373
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,800
more successful one to 10 employee businesses.

374
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,360
And if you are like me and believe that,

375
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,600
like I think there is a huge opportunity

376
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,440
for somebody to raise a venture fund

377
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,160
that all they do is invest in companies

378
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,960
that are providing AI, automation,

379
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,840
and tooling for that very small business category,

380
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,040
because the profitability of that category

381
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,560
is going to improve.

382
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,920
Traditionally, that's been a really hard category to serve

383
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,680
because there's a lot of business,

384
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,760
going out of business cancellation risk and everything.

385
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,520
I think that's going to change a lot.

386
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,600
The other category that you didn't include Kieran

387
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,960
that I would like to add,

388
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,880
and this is a hat tip to our friend Linus

389
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,120
who we had on the show recently,

390
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,480
he talked a lot about models operating on the edge.

391
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,120
So like having personalized models on your phone.

392
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,680
And like one of the most interesting things

393
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,440
that's happened this week is Rewind,

394
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,360
which is really awesome app to provide an AI layer across

395
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,120
basically everything you do on your computer,

396
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,720
just launched its iPhone app today.

397
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,320
And so now you can have this AI assistant on your iPhone

398
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,680
in a really powerful way,

399
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,200
in kind of this personal secure gesture data model

400
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,280
operating like on the edge on your phone.

401
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,080
And I think that is a category where

402
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,280
you're not going to have 100 winners,

403
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,200
but the handful of companies that win

404
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,640
are going to win pretty big.

405
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,200
You know what's one of the wildest thought exercises

406
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,960
for the three of us just to quickly touch on

407
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,560
in relation to this is,

408
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,080
if you told me like three months ago,

409
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,840
if you look at open AI, you would say,

410
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,800
wow, like open AI are going to be one of the biggest,

411
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,320
most profitable, biggest market cap businesses of all time.

412
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,960
Now I think open AI might be one of the most

413
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,960
interesting case studies in if distribution is truly a moat.

414
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,520
Because actually their core technology

415
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,960
is being eroded pretty rapidly.

416
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,640
I don't know what you think about that.

417
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,240
You agree or not, if you could like,

418
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,840
if you had 100,000 to invest,

419
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,200
are you putting that in like open AI today

420
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,680
or you think that their core business is

421
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,640
starting to be eroded by these open source models,

422
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,840
by like other companies just like replicating what they do.

423
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,640
You know, I think open AI is going to figure it out.

424
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,280
I think open AI has some of the smartest researchers

425
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,800
on the planet on their team.

426
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,720
So I do think that they're going to figure out

427
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,880
how to continually build more of a moat around their platform.

428
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,560
You know, some of the team that they have there behind the scenes,

429
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,080
I hate to try to pronounce their names.

430
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,560
Greg Brockman and some of the team there

431
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,920
are some of the people that are like,

432
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,520
you know, founding fathers of AI.

433
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,880
That have been doing this for a long time,

434
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,720
that are going to figure this stuff out.

435
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,280
So I do have faith in open AI.

436
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
If I had the money, I'd probably be putting it

437
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,040
more towards Microsoft and NVIDIA though,

438
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,200
because I think that's still the safer bet.

439
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,800
And Stan Lutman is an awesome, incredible founder.

440
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,480
So I think like part of it is,

441
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,840
the NVIDIA founder is an incredible founder.

442
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,200
Like if you've ever read up on that founder.

443
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,720
Oh yeah, Jen Simone, yep.

444
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,480
Yeah, what's really interesting about open AI,

445
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,760
like there was a really good tweet

446
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,960
about what Elon's doing at Twitter,

447
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,680
which is Elon is going through the biggest experiment

448
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,160
of all time to see if the only thing that truly matters

449
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,280
is like network effects.

450
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,360
Like, hey, getting rid of the brand,

451
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,120
getting rid of all of the actual users,

452
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,800
getting rid of all the things that people like.

453
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,720
But the thing he still has is network effects.

454
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,840
And if you have network effects,

455
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,120
like it's really an incredible moat and hard to disrupt.

456
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,920
And like open AI has not built network effects

457
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,200
into the product just yet,

458
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,120
but I do think part of your moat can just be

459
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,680
you have probably the best team in the industry

460
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,440
and like you'll figure out how to stay ahead.

461
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,520
But like the pace of evolution,

462
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,760
even in the kind of space that they're in,

463
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,000
like I don't even think I would have seen six months ago,

464
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
just how many competitors they have

465
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,360
in such a short amount of time.

466
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Yeah, and open AI too, you know,

467
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,920
they're not just chat GPT, we have to remember, right?

468
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,200
They've also got Dolly.

469
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,280
They also have the GPT 3.5, the GPT4 APIs.

470
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,600
I mean, how many thousands and thousands of companies

471
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,760
are running with the GPT4 API?

472
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,800
I mean, I get a GPT4 API bill every month

473
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
just from playing around with it myself.

474
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,720
So, you know, I think that they have a lot more going for them

475
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,840
than just chat GPT.

476
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,760
I think the public sees chat GPT

477
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,040
and that's sort of what the public thinks of with open AI.

478
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,080
But they've got, you know, that sort of API business

479
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,440
behind the scenes that's powering

480
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,360
so many other companies as well.

481
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,360
What do you think happens in the kind of spaces

482
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,960
where it's like quick to replicate?

483
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,280
Because there is a need for these kind of like writing tools,

484
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,920
image tools, video tools, the sales outreach tools.

485
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,200
Like they are going to be incredibly important to companies.

486
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,240
I think every company is going to use some form of these tools.

487
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,800
But I wonder like how you win or is there a winner

488
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
or everyone just uses their own special flavor?

489
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,080
There's two things here.

490
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,000
There's two things that are part of it.

491
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,920
One of the things that are part of it is with chat GPT,

492
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,680
we're all getting trained on a chat kind of interface,

493
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,360
but more of a chat workflow

494
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,240
where you can have a lot of different types of actions

495
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,760
happening in one stream.

496
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,560
And we're going to all want that.

497
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,600
It's a way better experience.

498
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,120
You and I collaborated on a chat GPT thread care

499
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,440
and it was like, awesome, great experience.

500
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,720
We're all going to want to do that more.

501
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,680
In a world where that's true, you know who benefits?

502
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:55,960
Platforms.

503
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,480
People who have a wide set of use cases

504
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,120
that they can bundle into that new experience

505
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,400
and just basically put AI and that chat experience on.

506
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,440
So I think incumbents and platforms are really going to win.

507
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,000
And I think a lot of those point solutions right now,

508
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,360
it's going to be a little bit like .com bus 3.0.

509
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,720
Where they're just going,

510
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,120
like a couple will make it and the majority will not

511
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,360
because what they're doing will get gobbled up

512
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,160
by a lot of the existing incumbents.

513
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,360
Right.

514
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,400
Matt, what tool has like other than like the open AI

515
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,000
or the code interpreter.

516
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,360
Me and Kip had a moment,

517
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,520
we were doing like code interpreter live.

518
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,320
We were kind of doing stuff analysis for the podcast and RSS.

519
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,600
And I use these tools all the time,

520
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,040
but I hadn't read because I'm like,

521
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,320
maybe it's because I don't have any friends.

522
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,120
So I hadn't used the share and function

523
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,200
where like I'd shared this analysis with Kip.

524
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,560
But my analysis took me two hours.

525
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,680
Like I was going back and forth,

526
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,120
getting it to create charts,

527
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,440
getting it to like create tables, join tables,

528
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,440
then create charts on those join tables.

529
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,000
And I was like, this is like awesome, right?

530
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,840
Like I was like, this is super awesome.

531
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,920
But then I sent it to Kip and Kip,

532
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,760
you can just click on the share link.

533
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,200
You import that entire chat charts data

534
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,120
and then you can just start like building on top of it.

535
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,160
I didn't actually not,

536
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,600
I thought I was sending him like a thread

537
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,200
and he could see it and share it,

538
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,880
but I didn't know he could just easily start

539
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,560
to like rapidly iterate on that.

540
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,760
And I just blown my mind

541
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,520
because now you can just start to share these like

542
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,480
conversations and all this stuff with someone else

543
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,320
and they can just build on that really, really rapidly.

544
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,160
And that was like a bit of mind-blowing experience.

545
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,680
What's been a tool like that for you,

546
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,600
which you're just like, holy smokes,

547
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,560
like this is a whole new way to do things.

548
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,640
So there's been a couple.

549
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,480
I mean, so Anthropics Clawed 2 actually blew me away

550
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,640
when they first made it available

551
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,560
because of that 100,000 token context window,

552
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,040
meaning that you can essentially upload an entire book

553
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,880
and ask questions of that book, right?

554
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,600
You can copy an entire giant, 100,000

555
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,760
or 50,000 word article or something,

556
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,360
paste it in there, ask questions of it.

557
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,520
So Clawed 2 is really, really impressive.

558
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,960
I've actually started using Clawed 2 almost more than ChatGPT,

559
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,520
especially for summarization type stuff

560
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,120
and getting bullet points and helping me rewrite stuff.

561
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,440
But I think more, since that's sort of similar to ChatGPT,

562
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I think the one tool that really blew my mind

563
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,880
when I did sort of a demo video on it

564
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,640
and I was sort of playing with it in real time,

565
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,520
that I really went, whoa, this is really crazy.

566
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,480
It was 11 Labs.

567
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,320
When I started playing with 11 Labs,

568
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,200
then I was able to train my own voice into 11 Labs

569
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,320
and then type in some text and then it spoke back to me.

570
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,520
I actually made a video of it on my YouTube channel

571
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,840
where I typed a bunch of words and had it speak back

572
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,040
and I was listening to it and I'm like,

573
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,440
yeah, I don't really think it sounds like me.

574
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,960
And then everybody on my YouTube channel,

575
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,400
all the comments were like,

576
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,160
I wasn't looking at my screen at that point

577
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,840
and I didn't realize you stopped talking.

578
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,120
Like I had some sort of cognitive dissonance from it

579
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,720
where I was like, that doesn't sound like me.

580
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,600
And everybody was like, no, that's you, that's your voice.

581
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,040
And then I started playing with it a little more

582
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,000
where I would take a voice from somebody from a podcast

583
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,400
and train it in there and see if I can replicate their voice.

584
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,440
And that was working.

585
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,320
And that to me was really, really mind blowing.

586
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,000
Also scary at the same time, right?

587
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,640
There's been a handful of scams that have popped up

588
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,760
where people have called somebody's parents

589
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,280
and then use somebody else's voice

590
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,040
to try to get money out of the parents.

591
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,000
And so it was one of the things where I played with it

592
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,480
for the first time and I went, this is mind blowing.

593
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,840
This is groundbreaking.

594
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,760
But also this scares the hell out of me.

595
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,680
Yeah, I watched that video.

596
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,880
I think it was around the time, Kip,

597
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,920
I watched you the Joe Rogan and Andrew Huberman fake podcast

598
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,920
when they actually were doing video

599
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,800
and then they out of the blue advertised

600
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,320
some sort of weight loss pills.

601
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,880
Hey, Joe, what do you think about aliens coming down

602
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,240
and they built the pyramids?

603
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,760
Like all the crazy stuff he talks about.

604
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,280
Oh, but what do you think about these weight loss pills?

605
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,160
Oh, they're super dope.

606
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,720
But still, wow, this stuff is going to come out

607
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,880
as pretty fast in terms of how rapidly

608
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,480
we're going to be able to do deepfakes and spoof people.

609
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,120
Absolutely.

610
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,080
All right, so Claude, 11 Labs, what else?

611
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,680
What else are your other favorite AI tools of 2023 so far?

612
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,640
So mid-journey, every time mid-journey releases a new update,

613
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,920
that just blows my mind.

614
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,120
Except for it's in Discord.

615
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,200
Are you a, you can't be a fan of the Discord experience.

616
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,880
Like why get out of the Discord?

617
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,120
Yeah, they are planning on getting out of the Discord.

618
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,160
In fact, if you've generated over, I think, 10,000 generations,

619
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,720
they let you use their web user interface.

620
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,240
But they are moving to a web interface,

621
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,960
but they're just, they're only letting certain beta testers

622
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,680
use it right now.

623
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,880
So it's getting there.

624
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,720
I also use Leonardo AI a lot,

625
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,240
which is another AI image generator that's really, really solid.

626
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,120
You can actually train your own sort of styles into it.

627
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,800
You can upload a whole bunch of images that you like,

628
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,240
and it will train on those styles,

629
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,640
and you can generate more images in that style.

630
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,000
So I like that one a lot.

631
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,520
You know, since I do a lot of YouTube videos,

632
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,720
I like to play with a lot of like,

633
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,080
create a video tools, right?

634
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,080
So I use RunwayML a lot.

635
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,920
I use a tool called Kyber a lot,

636
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,360
which makes really cool AI image generations.

637
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,800
It uses like Deforum,

638
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,120
and I think DiscoDiffusion behind the scenes.

639
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,640
I mean, there's just too many tools to list,

640
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,560
but there's, I play with a lot of like,

641
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,400
the visual effects type stuff,

642
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,400
because I'm constantly experimenting with,

643
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,640
what could I make that I can throw into a YouTube video

644
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,360
that make people go,

645
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,200
ooh, I need to know how he does that.

646
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,360
The video tools are the ones where you can have an avatar

647
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,200
within your, you're kind of go-to-market,

648
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
so you have an avatar on customer support,

649
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,680
or you have an avatar who's actually doing your sales,

650
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,720
and there's a company called Air,

651
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,520
they got a lot of traction,

652
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,720
but there's other companies doing this,

653
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,640
which is like, I can train it to sound like a human,

654
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,800
it can do the sales, it can do the customer support,

655
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,520
and it's like, they're like 80% there,

656
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,600
but that 80% is nowhere near good enough, right?

657
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,720
Like it's very monotone,

658
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,440
it's like, you know, the videos are just like,

659
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,360
well, this is me, I am speaking to you now,

660
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,400
like here, right?

661
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,520
Like they're just like, no tone, no personality.

662
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,040
I suspect that, I wonder how hard that 20% is gonna be.

663
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,320
I wonder if it's like one of those problems

664
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,640
where like the 20% is just like a huge jump up

665
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,680
from where we are today,

666
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,840
because video is like one of the,

667
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,360
I think most interesting spaces,

668
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,920
runway has probably one of the best tools,

669
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
but one of the ones I'm interested in is like,

670
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,160
how rapidly you can just have a person on support 24-7,

671
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,840
doing like your tweenshares,

672
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,720
how you can have someone,

673
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,960
your entire sales team like 24-7,

674
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,800
but it doesn't seem like we're close, it seems like.

675
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,640
I think the biggest problem with a lot of those tools

676
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,640
is honestly just the latency between

677
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,840
when you ask it the question,

678
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,600
and when it responds to the question, right?

679
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,560
Like you ask the question,

680
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,760
there's like a 10 second gap,

681
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,120
and then there's a response.

682
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,680
There are some companies that are figuring that out though.

683
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,120
There are some companies that,

684
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,920
I was talking to the CEO of a company called Convay,

685
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,440
who they're actually building this technology for video games,

686
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,960
where you can go up and speak into your microphone

687
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,800
with an NPC character,

688
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,520
and then the character sort of generates random,

689
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,880
real-time conversations.

690
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,640
So every time you play through the game,

691
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,800
you're gonna have different conversations

692
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,480
with that character, right?

693
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,560
So I could go up and ask them a question,

694
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,400
one play through, the second play through.

695
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,600
If I ask them the exact same question,

696
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,800
they're not gonna give me the same response

697
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,400
because it's all generated with AI.

698
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,080
Well, his program actually fixed that latency issue

699
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,160
where it actually has this sort of like

700
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,680
a buffer type thing built in,

701
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,280
where as I'm speaking,

702
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,480
while it's hearing these words,

703
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,240
it's already processing the words,

704
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,400
and then when I finally pause,

705
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,120
it's already processed the first part of what I said

706
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,960
and is ready to respond.

707
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,240
So they've actually figured it out

708
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,480
where the gap between what I say

709
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,080
and what they respond with is milliseconds.

710
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,160
So it's, I mean, it's getting really, really close.

711
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,080
And then with tools like 11 Labs,

712
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,840
I feel like all those tools need to do

713
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,800
to get rid of that sort of robotic response voice

714
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,000
is just tie into like an API, like 11 Labs API.

715
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,680
And now you've got a voice that sounds

716
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,800
just like a real human that's almost indistinguishable.

717
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,320
And then combine that with a tool like Synthesia

718
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,120
or something like that,

719
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,520
that actually puts that sort of human-looking avatar

720
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,480
in front of you.

721
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,240
So it looks like they're speaking to you

722
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,800
and now we're crossing that unkindly valley

723
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,840
and we've got somebody that is having a conversation,

724
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,480
sounds like a real voice and is responding in real time.

725
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,800
It's just the technologies all exist.

726
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,360
I haven't just seen one tool pull them all together

727
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,880
into a single purpose built tool for like sales.

728
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,520
Back in my software engineer days,

729
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,680
one of the interviews I went for like very early

730
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,320
at a college, the person who was interviewing me

731
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,520
like ran the entire software development department.

732
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,200
And he purposely, and he told me like afterwards

733
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,800
this is part of his interview style,

734
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,120
he purposely waited 20 seconds between asking a question,

735
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,800
you answering and him responding.

736
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:37,320
So he would leave like 20 seconds of uncomfortable silence.

737
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,400
And he said he reason, and he would just sit there like,

738
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,240
and he would nod his head for some reason and just like,

739
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,440
and you're like, oh, I think the reason he was like,

740
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,520
I do that because it's incredible how people decide to like fill

741
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,960
that 20 seconds.

742
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,880
They just say like, you know,

743
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,200
they just say like totally insane stuff.

744
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,120
But I'm like, okay, like, but it's not a normal situation

745
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,960
that I'm going to have to deal with as a software engineer.

746
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,040
Where like part of me being a great software engineer

747
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,960
has been able to deal with like 20 seconds,

748
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,840
specifically 20 seconds of like uncomfortable silence.

749
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,640
So I still think he would actually do pretty well as like

750
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,680
an AI avatar or sales person.

751
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,520
Yeah, yeah, I hear they do that on Shark Tank too,

752
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,720
just to see how people respond.

753
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,480
Yeah, I mean, yeah, once AI starts playing mental games with us,

754
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,200
then we're all screwed.

755
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,240
It's like, oh, come on, man, I can't deal with that.

756
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,400
I can barely deal with it from other humans.

757
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,760
Right, right.

758
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,320
The last one I want to touch on both of you is

759
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,080
this is actually Paris seems to be a real hub

760
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,880
of these kind of companies.

761
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,040
We talked about it, which is it feels like most companies,

762
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:43,000
most large companies will have a plug and play version of a AI,

763
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,160
like an LLM model just for them, right?

764
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,000
Like you'll be able to plug in your data.

765
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,320
You'll be able to like customize it for your needs.

766
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,480
And I suspect at some point, like you'll just be able to go

767
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,720
any kind of podcast or any YouTuber can go to a service,

768
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,120
pay a couple of bucks, put their RSS feed,

769
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,160
and get some like models back and be able to build apps on top of that.

770
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,680
Are you seeing much of that?

771
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,200
Like how do you feel about that?

772
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,840
How do both of you think that's going to be a pretty big,

773
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,200
a big important space?

774
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,240
Yeah, I mean, I'm already seeing that kind of stuff that already exists.

775
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,200
I mean, there's already apps out there that have, you know,

776
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,840
scraped the entire Huberman Labs podcast.

777
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,040
And you can go and have conversations with Andrew Huberman

778
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,040
based on all of the conversations he's had on his podcast already.

779
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,400
That sort of already exists.

780
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,960
There's a tool that I spoke with the founder called personal.ai.

781
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,440
And what that tool is, is you can actually plug in your own blogs, RSS feed.

782
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,040
You can plug in your Twitter account.

783
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,880
You can, you know, personally journal directly inside of the app.

784
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,240
And what it does is it learns more and more and more about you.

785
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,200
And then you can go in there and have conversations with it.

786
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,840
And based on all of your own data, it will know how you would respond.

787
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,880
But then you can also go and give a front end user interface to other people.

788
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,480
So people can have a conversation with virtual digital me.

789
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,040
Like that's already out there and there's a handful of tools that do that.

790
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,880
I think we're going to see that more and more.

791
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,560
I mean, I think that's probably more likely the future of customer service, right?

792
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:16,680
Where you've got these AI models that are trained on all of the database of user documentation.

793
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,800
They're trained on all of past customer support conversations and how the response was handled.

794
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:28,280
And then over time, these AI bots are going to be able to handle 98.9% of the conversations

795
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:33,400
that come through without ever needing to, you know, touch a human customer support rep.

796
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,880
So that I think is coming really fast.

797
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,040
I think that's sort of the next wave that we're going to see a lot of, honestly.

798
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,480
Well, yeah. And it's like, when we talk about customer support,

799
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,760
the reason I think this is important, because Kieran, I'm about to bring up

800
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,480
one of the AI startups that you and I are most confused by to get Matt's take on.

801
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,320
But this is me rationalizing why they might exist.

802
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,720
You know, when we talk about, oh, AI is going to solve customer support or it's going to solve sales.

803
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:05,080
The reality is humans like to interact with different types of people in those situations.

804
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:09,160
Like some people want a salesperson who's really to the point.

805
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:14,040
Others want somebody who's just going to be very detail oriented, et cetera.

806
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,560
Right. And that's come, that's where you're not just going to need like one model.

807
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:23,560
You're going to need very specific versions of a model to solve the audience you're trying to address.

808
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,600
And maybe, maybe that's why character.ai exists.

809
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,200
I don't really understand.

810
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,000
Yeah, I don't understand.

811
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,400
Yeah, this is a good, like what am I missing?

812
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,440
What am I missing?

813
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,000
What am I missing?

814
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:38,200
So much money and like, it seems like people are making some weird characters,

815
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,240
but like, are we, are we missing something about character?

816
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:47,640
This is like, I feel like I'm, you know, the person watching these humans act like NPC people

817
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:53,400
on TikTok doing gang gang ice cream, getting the dollars in, like, I feel that way about

818
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,520
characters that I know, like, I'm really into the AI space.

819
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,520
I'm like, I don't, I don't get the, I don't, what, what is this company doing?

820
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,960
Why are they going to be huge success?

821
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,240
Yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm with you.

822
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,640
I don't totally understand character AI.

823
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,840
Here's what I will say though.

824
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:13,160
I do have two kids, like they're both like sort of preteen age kids and they, for whatever

825
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,680
reason, love character AI.

826
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:17,560
Like them on their phone or on the desktop.

827
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,280
This is a part of that.

828
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,080
I just knew I was old.

829
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,840
So they've got their, they've got their Chromebooks.

830
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,320
Both my kids have little Chromebooks and they get into character AI and like,

831
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,880
we have a neighbor across the street that's the same age.

832
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,280
And apparently among like their age kids, like middle school age kids, they love this

833
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,000
sort of like fun digital companion thing.

834
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,640
It's like, it's like the new Tomagachi kind of thing, right?

835
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,360
Oh, wow.

836
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:45,880
That sort of generation seems to just be obsessed with this digital companion

837
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,400
conversation type app.

838
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,720
That's what I've noticed about it.

839
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,480
That's the only sort of justification I can make towards character AI.

840
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,240
I've played with it like once or twice and went, all right, I, you know,

841
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,000
I just had a conversation with Mega Man.

842
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,960
That, that was cool.

843
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,880
I don't know what else to do with this.

844
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,760
I love Mega Man.

845
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,680
But my kids like, they love it.

846
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,880
They're on character AI all the time, which is scary.

847
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,920
Hopefully that doesn't ruin, you know, real relationships and real

848
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,200
companionship with humans.

849
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,200
Hopefully it doesn't ruin like social skills and interpersonal skills and all the

850
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,960
things we actually need as a society.

851
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,360
Oh yeah.

852
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,520
That's a whole other rabbit hole that sort of scares me about AI is the whole digital

853
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,440
girlfriend thing that's starting to pop up where people are building relationships and

854
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,280
not feeling the need to have real relationships with, you know, the opposite sex

855
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,040
in real life because they've got their digital like, but that's a whole rabbit hole.

856
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,720
That's how population continues to decline.

857
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,200
Exactly.

858
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,800
They're $1 billion valuation.

859
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,440
So now we know they've, they've climbed the charts because Mega Man is on there.

860
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,040
I think Mega Man is kind of dope.

861
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,000
So I think that's, I think, I think that's a good case for them.

862
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,160
They're also, and Andres and Howard's back.

863
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,160
Matt, it's been incredible having you on the show.

864
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,120
We're both big fans.

865
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,360
We watch your YouTube channel.

866
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,080

And we really appreciate you coming on and spending this time with us.

869
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:03,880
Yeah.

870
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,520
Thanks for having me on.

871
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,200
This has been absolutely a blast.

872
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,080
I've had a good time.

873
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,440
This data is wrong every freaking time.

874
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,280
Have you heard of HubSpot?

875
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,680
HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated.

876
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,000
Whoa.

877
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,680
I can see the clients' whole history.

878
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:23,240
Calls, support tickets, emails, and here's a test from three days ago.

879
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,360
I totally missed.

880
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,240
HubSpot, grow better.
