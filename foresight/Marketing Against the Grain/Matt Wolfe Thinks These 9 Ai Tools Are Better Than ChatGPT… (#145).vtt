WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.320
On this episode of Marketing Against the Green, we talked to Matt Wolf.

00:04.320 --> 00:08.800
Matt has one of the biggest and best YouTube channels, all about AI, and so we had to talk

00:08.800 --> 00:11.720
to Matt all about apps and tools.

00:11.720 --> 00:17.120
We get into the biggest AI winners, the biggest AI losers, and who are going to be the biggest

00:17.120 --> 00:18.680
AI apps in the future?

00:18.680 --> 00:20.720
Where should you invest your money?

00:20.720 --> 00:22.800
I'm Kieran Flanagan, the CMO at Zapier.

00:22.800 --> 00:26.600
I'm here always with my co-host, Kip Bonner, the CMO at HubSpot.

00:26.600 --> 00:27.600
Let's get into it.

00:27.600 --> 00:40.520
Okay, Matt, it is great to have you on the show.

00:40.520 --> 00:45.440
I've spent a lot of hours watching your YouTube channel, getting all of the latest news, getting

00:45.440 --> 00:48.920
all of the latest apps, so we're really excited to have you on the show.

00:48.920 --> 00:49.920
Yeah, thanks for having me.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.920
I'm excited to nerd out and chat with you guys about this stuff.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.760
We're excited to steal your brain for a minute.

00:54.760 --> 00:55.760
Yeah.

00:55.760 --> 00:56.760
Get all of your AI knowledge.

00:56.920 --> 01:01.520
I thought we could start with this, which is, how did you start in the YouTube AI space?

01:01.520 --> 01:02.960
How did you end up there?

01:02.960 --> 01:04.200
What was the tip and point?

01:04.200 --> 01:05.560
What were you doing before that?

01:05.560 --> 01:07.400
Just give us a little bit of the context, the background.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.400
Sure, yeah.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.840
I've been doing digital marketing stuff since 2009.

01:11.840 --> 01:17.640
I quit my day job, so to speak, back in 2009, and have been all in on content marketing

01:17.640 --> 01:18.640
ever since.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.160
My YouTube channel started in 2009.

01:20.160 --> 01:25.880
I started blogging in 2009, and then over the years, I was just testing all sorts of

01:25.880 --> 01:27.280
different things.

01:27.280 --> 01:30.480
I had an online course around how to drive traffic.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.080
I've had online courses around podcasting.

01:33.080 --> 01:37.560
My first course that I ever sold was about how to build blogs, and so over the years,

01:37.560 --> 01:39.600
I was just testing different courses.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.680
I got really good at affiliate marketing, and most of my income over the last decade

01:43.680 --> 01:48.240
has actually come from affiliate revenue, from promoting other products and my content,

01:48.240 --> 01:53.400
and so I've just been surfing around in the world of digital marketing and course creation

01:53.400 --> 01:58.120
and just playing with whatever would work, and I had a lot of good months and a lot of

01:58.120 --> 02:02.040
bad months where I didn't know how I was going to pay the bills, and it was just kind of

02:02.040 --> 02:09.600
throwing stuff at the wall all the way up until 2022 when the AI stuff started to pick

02:09.600 --> 02:10.800
up some steam.

02:10.800 --> 02:17.280
So at the time, I had a top 1% podcast with my co-host, Joe Fear, called Hustle and Flowchart.

02:17.280 --> 02:21.760
He's actually still running that podcast to this day, but him and I were podcasting and

02:21.760 --> 02:25.880
interviewing other digital marketers and things like that, and we started to have people

02:25.880 --> 02:30.120
come on and talk about some of these newer technologies that were coming out.

02:30.120 --> 02:35.200
One of the first ones we came across was Jasper, which was like an AI copywriting tool.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.720
At the time, it was called Conversion AI, and then it was called something that Marvel

02:38.720 --> 02:43.320
sued him for or wanted to sue him for, and then it eventually became Jasper, so I learned

02:43.320 --> 02:49.040
about GPT-3, and we actually started making content about GPT-3 and Jasper and some of

02:49.040 --> 02:54.480
these AI tools back in 2021, but nobody was really paying attention to AI back then.

02:54.480 --> 03:00.400
Nobody really cared about it, and then about mid 2022, I made a video on my YouTube channel

03:00.400 --> 03:04.840
about AI art and various AI art generators, and this was actually before Mid Journey came

03:04.840 --> 03:05.840
out.

03:05.840 --> 03:10.160
I was talking about Dolly and some of the stable diffusion stuff that was available, and that

03:10.160 --> 03:11.360
video started to do well.

03:11.360 --> 03:15.000
It got a few thousand views, and I went, oh, that's better than any of the other videos

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
I put out.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.720
Maybe I'll do another video on AI.

03:17.720 --> 03:23.040
I did a video about how to train your own face into the AI using a tool called DreamBoost,

03:23.040 --> 03:25.640
so you can make AI images with your own likeness.

03:25.640 --> 03:31.440
That video doubled my best video and had 15,000 views, and I went, okay, I'm going to keep

03:31.440 --> 03:34.040
going down this AI path.

03:34.040 --> 03:38.400
Then the video that really took off was when Chat GPT was released.

03:38.400 --> 03:43.360
I made a video around Chat GPT, and then that one, I remember, I made that video.

03:43.360 --> 03:48.200
I published it at 10 p.m. on a Tuesday or something, and then went to bed, woke up the

03:48.200 --> 03:52.280
next morning, and that video had 60,000 views, and I went, oh, my God, this is the best video

03:52.280 --> 03:56.920
I've ever done, and in 12 hours it got 60,000 views, and that video actually went on to do

03:56.920 --> 04:01.560
over a million views over the course of the next two weeks.

04:01.560 --> 04:05.160
That was sort of the pivot point where I went, I'm just going all in on AI.

04:05.160 --> 04:09.360
Every video I make from here on out is going to be about the latest, coolest AI tools.

04:09.360 --> 04:10.360
I'm going to make tutorials.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.720
I'm going to talk about the news.

04:11.760 --> 04:16.880
I'm going to talk about cool tools that I come across, and so ever since about October

04:16.880 --> 04:22.320
of last year, every video I've released has just been about the coolest AI stuff that

04:22.320 --> 04:27.600
I've built or come across or tutorials or things that I've learned how to do and just

04:27.600 --> 04:33.640
shown it off, and that's been the last 10 months of my life of just making that content.

04:33.640 --> 04:37.160
In that same time, I also built a website called Future Tools because I was coming across

04:37.240 --> 04:42.720
all these AI tools, and I was struggling to sort of wrap my head around all these tools.

04:42.720 --> 04:46.560
I was putting them into an Excel spreadsheet, but it got to a point where the Excel spreadsheet

04:46.560 --> 04:51.280
had 100 rows in it, and I was kind of losing track of what did what, so I literally built

04:51.280 --> 04:55.200
Future Tools as like a database for myself to kind of wrap my head around what tools

04:55.200 --> 04:57.160
I've come across and what they do.

04:57.160 --> 05:01.200
I shared that on Twitter, that got retweeted, it kind of went viral.

05:01.200 --> 05:06.760
My Future Tools website blew up, and now it gets over a million views per month, so it's

05:07.360 --> 05:12.080
the last 10 months have just been a roller coaster after over a decade of just kind of

05:12.080 --> 05:17.200
trying different stuff and having little successes here and there, and now all of a sudden, this

05:17.200 --> 05:18.600
is my life now.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.440
That's the lesson for everybody watching, right?

05:20.440 --> 05:27.200
This is the story time and time again, which is it takes years to build a quality of skills

05:27.200 --> 05:33.200
that you can do something well, and then find the right fit of topic and audience for yourself

05:33.200 --> 05:35.320
to really break out.

05:35.560 --> 05:38.120
I think, Kieran, when you and I started this podcast, we were like, oh, it's going to take

05:38.120 --> 05:43.440
us three to five years to make this thing big, real, like everything we want, and I

05:43.440 --> 05:47.600
think that's the right timeline for anybody to consider, and the reason most people fail

05:47.600 --> 05:50.240
is because they just don't do it long enough.

05:50.240 --> 05:54.200
They don't get into it, and the other thing they don't do is they don't do what you did,

05:54.200 --> 05:56.760
Matt, and pivot when they get the aha moment.

05:56.760 --> 06:00.200
You woke up to that video, you had your aha moment, and you're like, all right, I know

06:00.200 --> 06:05.040
what I'm doing now, and I'm okay leaving that stuff behind, and now I'm going in a new direction.

06:05.080 --> 06:08.280
I think that's a really interesting point, like Matt, was it the same YouTube channel

06:08.280 --> 06:13.160
you had since 2009, or so you're just grinding away and then pivoted to AI.

06:13.160 --> 06:16.880
The other really important thing is, Matt, because you've been at this like 2009, you

06:16.880 --> 06:18.600
mentioned affiliate, all of these things.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.600
Did you ever hang out in the warrior form?

06:20.600 --> 06:24.120
Back in the glorious, back in the day, when the warrior form was the warrior form.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.120
Kieran loves the warrior form.

06:25.120 --> 06:29.280
Yep, yep, I actually, one of my first products I ever sold was a WSO in the warrior form.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.280
There you go.

06:30.880 --> 06:36.840
That's where all the best people came from is the old school shady warrior form days.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.520
Yep, that's where I originated back.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.040
I remember back in 2007, when I was still working in my day job, I was working in a

06:44.040 --> 06:46.840
manufacturing plant whenever the boss wasn't looking.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.600
I was in the warrior form reading about various ways to make money online.

06:51.400 --> 06:51.800
Let's go.

06:51.800 --> 06:56.040
I was in there, getting my Frank Kearns, even page, all the copywriter stuff.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.160
Also, and so I think, yeah, but I think coming back to Kearns point, people have two short

07:01.160 --> 07:05.320
of time horizons on what success looks like, and they give up before they ever get started.

07:05.320 --> 07:08.040
And like getting started is like a couple of years.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.480
And that's where they kind of like give up.

07:09.480 --> 07:13.240
I've actually seen studies where you can actually see like a most podcasters, most

07:13.240 --> 07:17.080
people who blog, they kind of give up at a certain point in time and they give up ever

07:17.080 --> 07:20.760
before they've actually even figured out what their thing is, like what their angle is,

07:20.760 --> 07:24.360
what their topic is, what their kind of like area of expertise is going to be,

07:24.360 --> 07:25.640
where their niche is going to be.

07:25.640 --> 07:26.600
And so it's like super cool.

07:26.600 --> 07:29.480
Like you just kept kind of iterating, kept trying to figure out like,

07:29.480 --> 07:31.400
what was the thing that was going to resonate with your audience?

07:31.400 --> 07:33.480
And you got one signal and you went all in.

07:33.480 --> 07:33.880
For sure.

07:33.880 --> 07:34.040
Yeah.

07:34.040 --> 07:38.360
I mean, my thing has always kind of been, I nerd out about cool tools, right?

07:38.360 --> 07:41.240
So back in the early days, when I first started my YouTube channel,

07:41.240 --> 07:42.840
I was sharing different WordPress plugins.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.000
I had a WordPress site and I was like, oh, check out this plugin.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.280
It does this, check out this plugin.

07:46.280 --> 07:46.840
It did this.

07:46.840 --> 07:50.280
And then the first course that I ever sold was a course on WordPress.

07:50.280 --> 07:53.000
And I was sharing various WordPress plugins.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.640
So like the sort of common threads have always been,

07:55.640 --> 07:58.760
I love making content and I love nerding out about cool tools.

07:58.760 --> 08:03.640
It's just in 2022 when AI, all of these new tools started to flood the market.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.160
It was kind of like, I found my home.

08:05.160 --> 08:08.040
These are the tools that like I'm excited about,

08:08.040 --> 08:09.960
but also the world is getting excited about.

08:10.520 --> 08:16.040
It's incredible how much money or what kind of business you can build around cool tools.

08:16.040 --> 08:19.400
Like I remember back in the day when I was like really leaning into search,

08:19.960 --> 08:23.480
this guy was just obsessed by like Apple, Apple products,

08:23.480 --> 08:24.920
like MacBooks in particular.

08:24.920 --> 08:28.760
And just built this entire business, search business at the time,

08:28.760 --> 08:32.360
like AdSense was like the cool thing to try to make money through.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.720
And just own like every search term you could actually own through,

08:35.720 --> 08:37.560
like all of these different search terms around MacBooks

08:37.560 --> 08:40.280
and all of the kind of different laptops or computers that Apple had.

08:40.280 --> 08:44.280
That dude brought in like millions, millions every year.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.280
Like just with this site, didn't do anything about it.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.920
So like finding niche, finding this topic is really important.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.480
One thing I wanted to try out on you both is,

08:52.040 --> 08:53.880
so Kip and I talk about this all the time.

08:54.360 --> 08:57.720
We do some investing, talked to a lot of founders,

08:57.720 --> 08:59.960
try to find like good spaces to invest in.

08:59.960 --> 09:03.320
And so one of the things I've been doing on AI is trying to like map out

09:03.320 --> 09:05.560
where I see a lot of the momentum right now,

09:05.560 --> 09:08.360
like where I see a lot of the apps, where I'm having all the conversations.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.600
And so I wanted to kind of map out where I see it,

09:10.600 --> 09:13.160
let you all say whether there's things I'm missing,

09:13.160 --> 09:14.280
things that you disagree with,

09:14.280 --> 09:16.840
and then kind of like talk about where do we think the winners

09:16.840 --> 09:18.040
or losers are going to appear from?

09:18.120 --> 09:20.280
Like there's been basically where are the early winners

09:20.280 --> 09:21.960
that we can go through, like the happy winners,

09:21.960 --> 09:23.400
but I don't think they're going to be long-term winners

09:23.400 --> 09:25.400
and where will the long-term winners come from?

09:26.040 --> 09:29.640
The first are just like the kind of chat LLM models, right?

09:29.640 --> 09:31.880
Chat, GBT, Bardee, Llama.

09:32.760 --> 09:35.480
I don't know if you saw Facebook's latest release.

09:35.480 --> 09:36.840
Actually, there's a company you probably know,

09:36.840 --> 09:38.920
that's not because you know all things about AI tools,

09:38.920 --> 09:41.880
but one of my favorite tools is like perplexity AI,

09:41.880 --> 09:42.920
the kind of search engine.

09:42.920 --> 09:43.960
And they released a chat bot

09:43.960 --> 09:46.280
based upon Facebook's latest open source model,

09:46.280 --> 09:47.640
which I thought was really cool.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.120
But basically all of the like Entropic Clawed,

09:50.120 --> 09:52.120
all of the different models like Poe.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.200
The second, so that's like one batch, right?

09:54.200 --> 09:56.200
And it's actually really hard to invest in that batch,

09:56.200 --> 09:57.720
actually, because you don't see many of them

09:57.720 --> 09:59.000
and like it's really hard to pick winners,

09:59.000 --> 10:00.440
but we should talk about that batch.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.360
The second is like the creative tools, right?

10:02.360 --> 10:05.080
You mentioned Jasper was one of the very early tools,

10:05.080 --> 10:07.960
the writing tools, the image tools, the video tools,

10:07.960 --> 10:10.120
like Runway is an incredible video tool.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.840
Image Journey is obviously one of the best image tools.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.120
So that's a whole other space.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.000
The third space for me is like B2B tools.

10:17.480 --> 10:18.840
I don't know if you're seeing them or this, Kip.

10:18.840 --> 10:22.600
Like, you know, AI CRMs, AI sales tools,

10:22.600 --> 10:24.200
like all of the things you need to do.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.680
A lot of it is actually the AI sales outreach tools,

10:26.680 --> 10:30.120
right now, like sales tools, customer success tools,

10:30.120 --> 10:31.240
customer support tools.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.960
Like basically how you run a B2B go to market.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.280
The fourth is data analysis, right?

10:36.280 --> 10:38.280
We did a whole episode on code interpreter.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.040
But then there's all of these other plugins

10:40.040 --> 10:43.160
that can integrate to Excel, can integrate into Google Sheets,

10:43.160 --> 10:45.000
can integrate into your data platform

10:45.000 --> 10:47.480
and be able to provide a kind of chat layer

10:47.480 --> 10:48.840
on top of that data.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.760
The fifth is like knowledge work tools.

10:50.760 --> 10:52.360
And so knowledge work tools were the one

10:52.360 --> 10:54.680
that I talked a lot about at the start with you, Kip,

10:54.680 --> 10:58.520
is like the hardest thing about fast growth companies

10:58.520 --> 11:00.280
is that people get disconnected

11:00.280 --> 11:02.920
from the core information that's important.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.600
Like it just becomes really hard.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.520
Slack, I think, is a really incredible tool

11:06.520 --> 11:07.960
that actually makes this much worse,

11:07.960 --> 11:10.200
where like it is hard to get a grasp

11:10.200 --> 11:12.920
on all of the data churning through a company.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.520
And so you have these kind of knowledge tools

11:14.520 --> 11:16.280
that existing companies like a Glean,

11:16.280 --> 11:19.080
like a chief knowledge officer, there's a Glean.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.840
Two of my companies actually pivoted

11:20.840 --> 11:22.600
to try to solve this problem recently.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.760
There's a note taken tools for Zoom.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.360
Like all of the tools you could have

11:26.360 --> 11:29.000
to like keep a company much more efficient,

11:29.000 --> 11:31.160
keep knowledge running through that company

11:31.160 --> 11:32.280
in much more efficient ways.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.440
And then there's all the productivity tools, right?

11:34.440 --> 11:36.840
Like just like how we be more productive.

11:36.840 --> 11:40.360
And so I want to like pause, let you all react to that.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.520
What are categories you think that maybe I've missed

11:42.520 --> 11:43.880
or they're the wrong categories?

11:43.880 --> 11:45.640
What does that sound in terms of like

11:45.640 --> 11:46.440
how we think about that today?

11:46.440 --> 11:47.880
You're trying to figure out where to put some money.

11:47.880 --> 11:48.920
Matt, tell me where to invest.

11:50.760 --> 11:51.480
Please, Matt.

11:51.480 --> 11:52.280
Please do it.

11:52.280 --> 11:54.040
I'm like, well, the listeners get to benefit.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.640
The viewers get to benefit.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.000
Where should I put my dollars?

11:57.000 --> 11:58.840
All right, I'll let Matt go first.

11:58.840 --> 11:59.800
He's our guest here.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.560
Yeah, so when it comes to that kind of stuff,

12:02.520 --> 12:05.320
I tend to think that the best place to be

12:05.320 --> 12:07.320
is the shovel sellers, right?

12:07.320 --> 12:09.800
Like the NVIDIAs, the AMDs,

12:09.800 --> 12:13.000
the companies that are benefiting no matter where.

12:13.640 --> 12:14.920
Like what tools you're using.

12:14.920 --> 12:18.760
I think Microsoft has a really, really smart plan, right?

12:18.760 --> 12:19.720
What you just mentioned,

12:19.720 --> 12:23.400
Perplexity is using Llama 2, which is Meta's platform.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.200
Well, Meta just partnered with Microsoft

12:26.200 --> 12:29.160
to release this Llama 2 platform, right?

12:29.160 --> 12:33.160
Well, Microsoft also is partnered with OpenAI on ChatGPT.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.360
So you look at that and they're like,

12:34.360 --> 12:37.960
okay, didn't they just partner with two competing projects?

12:37.960 --> 12:40.360
Well, one's closed source with the ChatGPT.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.200
One's open source with Llama.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.680
Well, the common denominator between those two

12:44.680 --> 12:49.320
is they're both going to be using Microsoft's Azure servers, right?

12:49.320 --> 12:52.040
So Microsoft is going to get the benefit

12:52.040 --> 12:54.200
of people using the open source, the closed source,

12:54.200 --> 12:56.840
because it's all going to be on the Azure servers, right?

12:56.840 --> 12:58.520
And then NVIDIA, right?

12:58.520 --> 13:01.800
NVIDIA makes all of the GPUs, all of the graphic cards,

13:01.800 --> 13:05.320
all of the, pretty much all of these cloud compute systems

13:05.320 --> 13:07.080
are using NVIDIA GPUs.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.160
So NVIDIA is going to really benefit.

13:09.160 --> 13:11.320
AMD is trying to get into the game.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.640
So a lot of those are the types of tools

13:13.640 --> 13:16.120
that I would really be wanting to look at.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.240
I think my worry with a lot of the large language models,

13:19.240 --> 13:21.880
with a lot of the image generation tools,

13:21.880 --> 13:24.040
even the like new text to speech tools

13:24.040 --> 13:26.600
that are coming out that are really, really, really good,

13:26.600 --> 13:30.120
is there's open source models, there's closed source models,

13:30.120 --> 13:34.440
there's APIs, there's no real moat on any of them, right?

13:34.440 --> 13:37.960
Like anybody can go and build on top of Llama 2

13:38.040 --> 13:42.600
and build a competitor to chat GPT and improve off of it

13:42.600 --> 13:44.360
and build something even better.

13:44.360 --> 13:48.520
Anybody can go and use an 11 Labs API,

13:48.520 --> 13:51.000
which is a text to speech generator,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.680
and go and build better and better text to speech tools.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.960
Most of the AI art image generation tools,

13:57.960 --> 14:00.360
they're either using stable diffusion under the hood,

14:00.360 --> 14:02.520
or they're using Dolly under the hood.

14:02.520 --> 14:05.560
So a lot of these tools, they just don't have that moat,

14:05.560 --> 14:09.000
and it's just so easy for so many tools to pop up.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.840
And so I feel like a lot of those platforms,

14:10.840 --> 14:12.840
there's gonna be a bit of a race to the bottom

14:12.840 --> 14:15.320
where you're gonna see companies pop up

14:15.320 --> 14:17.720
and make a cheaper version that does the same thing,

14:17.720 --> 14:18.920
and then another version that's cheaper

14:18.920 --> 14:19.640
that does the same thing,

14:19.640 --> 14:21.480
and eventually a version that's completely free,

14:21.480 --> 14:23.720
but supported by ads everywhere.

14:23.720 --> 14:27.800
So a lot of the models that are coming out now,

14:27.800 --> 14:31.480
I would have a real concern about the long-term future of them,

14:31.480 --> 14:34.600
just because of how much everything

14:34.600 --> 14:36.120
seems to be moving to open source,

14:36.120 --> 14:40.040
and how many available APIs are out there.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.640
Well, look, I like that we're being your investment counsel,

14:43.640 --> 14:46.840
and we're happy to be your CIOs today, Kieran.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.200
Maybe you'll actually make some money,

14:48.200 --> 14:49.640
and your companies won't go out of business.

14:52.040 --> 14:52.920
Not saying that.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.040
Shots fired.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.640
But it's kind of what's happening.

14:56.760 --> 14:57.880
Be but I turn.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.240
But here's my take.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.320
I agree with what's Matt saying.

15:05.320 --> 15:08.520
In a world of whether you're an investor,

15:08.520 --> 15:11.080
or you're a worker who wants to go work

15:11.080 --> 15:11.960
at one of these companies,

15:11.960 --> 15:12.760
or you're a buyer,

15:12.760 --> 15:15.480
you're thinking about buying one of these tools,

15:15.480 --> 15:17.880
I think there are two things to really consider

15:17.880 --> 15:19.720
to understand where the big opportunity

15:19.720 --> 15:20.920
long-term is gonna be,

15:20.920 --> 15:23.000
and which is Matt touched on one,

15:23.000 --> 15:24.120
which is distribution.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.280
He touched on the other one, economics.

15:26.280 --> 15:28.680
What is differentiated about this company

15:28.680 --> 15:32.840
that's going to allow them to survive the long-term?

15:32.840 --> 15:36.120
AMD and NVIDIA and all of the picks

15:36.120 --> 15:38.120
and shovels kind of providers,

15:38.120 --> 15:40.360
they're differentiated because the economics are great

15:40.360 --> 15:41.640
because there's gonna be constant demand.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.000
As the market goes up,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.240
their economics are going to improve.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.320
The other thing that they have is they're differentiated

15:47.320 --> 15:49.000
because they have proprietary technology.

15:49.960 --> 15:53.640
NVIDIA has its own way of manufacturing facilities,

15:53.640 --> 15:55.400
everything of making its GPUs.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.320
That's a really hard thing to do.

15:57.320 --> 15:58.680
If you are just writing code

15:58.680 --> 16:01.080
on top of somebody else's APIs,

16:01.080 --> 16:03.160
that's not very differentiated.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.600
And your economics are tough

16:04.600 --> 16:06.440
because one, you're at the mercy

16:06.440 --> 16:08.840
of whatever that API access costs.

16:08.840 --> 16:12.200
And two, it's really hard for you to build a product

16:12.200 --> 16:13.960
that is deep enough that provides enough value

16:13.960 --> 16:16.040
that you don't have a lot of customer churn issues

16:16.040 --> 16:17.720
where you have a lot of customers cancel.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.200
And that's what we're seeing in the AI space right now

16:20.200 --> 16:21.960
is a lot of customers canceling

16:21.960 --> 16:23.400
and a lot of these companies dealing

16:23.400 --> 16:25.880
with really massive churn issues,

16:25.880 --> 16:27.640
especially given that the pace of innovation,

16:27.640 --> 16:30.600
like Matt is on his YouTube channel all the time

16:30.680 --> 16:32.200
talking about new stuff,

16:32.200 --> 16:34.280
which means that like you could have a plan

16:34.280 --> 16:35.720
and a model that's like obsolete.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.320
Pace of innovation is crazy,

16:37.320 --> 16:39.960
particularly because it's so much easier to build,

16:39.960 --> 16:41.160
like it takes three to five people

16:41.160 --> 16:42.680
to build something that historically

16:42.680 --> 16:44.040
has taken like 50 to 60 people.

16:44.040 --> 16:44.920
This is my thesis.

16:44.920 --> 16:45.800
Go picks and shovels.

16:46.360 --> 16:47.720
Matt, I was what's app in here

16:47.720 --> 16:49.160
and earlier today about an idea

16:49.160 --> 16:50.360
that we're going to get your take on,

16:50.360 --> 16:52.760
which is I think one of the winners

16:52.760 --> 16:54.120
are very small businesses.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.920
Because of AI and automation,

16:56.920 --> 16:59.480
we're going to have more and more profitable,

16:59.480 --> 17:01.800
more successful one to 10 employee businesses.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.360
And if you are like me and believe that,

17:04.360 --> 17:06.600
like I think there is a huge opportunity

17:06.600 --> 17:08.440
for somebody to raise a venture fund

17:08.440 --> 17:11.160
that all they do is invest in companies

17:11.160 --> 17:13.960
that are providing AI, automation,

17:13.960 --> 17:16.840
and tooling for that very small business category,

17:16.840 --> 17:20.040
because the profitability of that category

17:20.040 --> 17:21.560
is going to improve.

17:21.560 --> 17:24.920
Traditionally, that's been a really hard category to serve

17:24.920 --> 17:26.680
because there's a lot of business,

17:26.680 --> 17:28.760
going out of business cancellation risk and everything.

17:28.760 --> 17:30.520
I think that's going to change a lot.

17:30.520 --> 17:32.600
The other category that you didn't include Kieran

17:32.600 --> 17:33.960
that I would like to add,

17:33.960 --> 17:35.880
and this is a hat tip to our friend Linus

17:35.880 --> 17:38.120
who we had on the show recently,

17:38.120 --> 17:41.480
he talked a lot about models operating on the edge.

17:41.480 --> 17:46.120
So like having personalized models on your phone.

17:46.120 --> 17:48.680
And like one of the most interesting things

17:48.680 --> 17:50.440
that's happened this week is Rewind,

17:50.440 --> 17:54.360
which is really awesome app to provide an AI layer across

17:54.360 --> 17:56.120
basically everything you do on your computer,

17:56.120 --> 17:57.720
just launched its iPhone app today.

17:57.720 --> 18:01.320
And so now you can have this AI assistant on your iPhone

18:01.320 --> 18:02.680
in a really powerful way,

18:02.680 --> 18:06.200
in kind of this personal secure gesture data model

18:06.200 --> 18:08.280
operating like on the edge on your phone.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.080
And I think that is a category where

18:11.080 --> 18:12.280
you're not going to have 100 winners,

18:12.280 --> 18:14.200
but the handful of companies that win

18:14.200 --> 18:15.640
are going to win pretty big.

18:15.640 --> 18:18.200
You know what's one of the wildest thought exercises

18:18.200 --> 18:19.960
for the three of us just to quickly touch on

18:19.960 --> 18:21.560
in relation to this is,

18:21.560 --> 18:23.080
if you told me like three months ago,

18:23.080 --> 18:24.840
if you look at open AI, you would say,

18:24.920 --> 18:27.800
wow, like open AI are going to be one of the biggest,

18:27.800 --> 18:31.320
most profitable, biggest market cap businesses of all time.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.960
Now I think open AI might be one of the most

18:33.960 --> 18:37.960
interesting case studies in if distribution is truly a moat.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.520
Because actually their core technology

18:40.520 --> 18:41.960
is being eroded pretty rapidly.

18:41.960 --> 18:43.640
I don't know what you think about that.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.240
You agree or not, if you could like,

18:45.240 --> 18:46.840
if you had 100,000 to invest,

18:46.840 --> 18:50.200
are you putting that in like open AI today

18:50.200 --> 18:52.680
or you think that their core business is

18:53.400 --> 18:55.640
starting to be eroded by these open source models,

18:55.640 --> 18:58.840
by like other companies just like replicating what they do.

18:58.840 --> 19:01.640
You know, I think open AI is going to figure it out.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.280
I think open AI has some of the smartest researchers

19:04.280 --> 19:05.800
on the planet on their team.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.720
So I do think that they're going to figure out

19:08.360 --> 19:11.880
how to continually build more of a moat around their platform.

19:11.880 --> 19:15.560
You know, some of the team that they have there behind the scenes,

19:15.560 --> 19:17.080
I hate to try to pronounce their names.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.560
Greg Brockman and some of the team there

19:19.560 --> 19:20.920
are some of the people that are like,

19:20.920 --> 19:22.520
you know, founding fathers of AI.

19:22.520 --> 19:23.880
That have been doing this for a long time,

19:23.880 --> 19:25.720
that are going to figure this stuff out.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.280
So I do have faith in open AI.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.280
If I had the money, I'd probably be putting it

19:30.280 --> 19:32.040
more towards Microsoft and NVIDIA though,

19:32.040 --> 19:34.200
because I think that's still the safer bet.

19:34.200 --> 19:37.800
And Stan Lutman is an awesome, incredible founder.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.480
So I think like part of it is,

19:39.480 --> 19:42.840
the NVIDIA founder is an incredible founder.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.200
Like if you've ever read up on that founder.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.720
Oh yeah, Jen Simone, yep.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.480
Yeah, what's really interesting about open AI,

19:47.480 --> 19:48.760
like there was a really good tweet

19:48.760 --> 19:49.960
about what Elon's doing at Twitter,

19:49.960 --> 19:52.680
which is Elon is going through the biggest experiment

19:52.680 --> 19:55.160
of all time to see if the only thing that truly matters

19:55.160 --> 19:56.280
is like network effects.

19:56.280 --> 19:58.360
Like, hey, getting rid of the brand,

19:58.360 --> 20:00.120
getting rid of all of the actual users,

20:00.120 --> 20:01.800
getting rid of all the things that people like.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.720
But the thing he still has is network effects.

20:03.720 --> 20:04.840
And if you have network effects,

20:04.840 --> 20:08.120
like it's really an incredible moat and hard to disrupt.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.920
And like open AI has not built network effects

20:10.920 --> 20:12.200
into the product just yet,

20:12.200 --> 20:14.120
but I do think part of your moat can just be

20:14.120 --> 20:16.680
you have probably the best team in the industry

20:16.680 --> 20:18.440
and like you'll figure out how to stay ahead.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.520
But like the pace of evolution,

20:20.520 --> 20:22.760
even in the kind of space that they're in,

20:22.760 --> 20:25.000
like I don't even think I would have seen six months ago,

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
just how many competitors they have

20:27.000 --> 20:28.360
in such a short amount of time.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.360
Yeah, and open AI too, you know,

20:30.360 --> 20:32.920
they're not just chat GPT, we have to remember, right?

20:32.920 --> 20:34.200
They've also got Dolly.

20:34.200 --> 20:38.280
They also have the GPT 3.5, the GPT4 APIs.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.600
I mean, how many thousands and thousands of companies

20:40.600 --> 20:42.760
are running with the GPT4 API?

20:42.760 --> 20:45.800
I mean, I get a GPT4 API bill every month

20:45.800 --> 20:47.800
just from playing around with it myself.

20:47.800 --> 20:51.720
So, you know, I think that they have a lot more going for them

20:51.720 --> 20:52.840
than just chat GPT.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.760
I think the public sees chat GPT

20:54.760 --> 20:58.040
and that's sort of what the public thinks of with open AI.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.080
But they've got, you know, that sort of API business

21:01.080 --> 21:02.440
behind the scenes that's powering

21:02.440 --> 21:04.360
so many other companies as well.

21:04.360 --> 21:06.360
What do you think happens in the kind of spaces

21:06.360 --> 21:07.960
where it's like quick to replicate?

21:07.960 --> 21:10.280
Because there is a need for these kind of like writing tools,

21:10.280 --> 21:12.920
image tools, video tools, the sales outreach tools.

21:12.920 --> 21:16.200
Like they are going to be incredibly important to companies.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.240
I think every company is going to use some form of these tools.

21:19.240 --> 21:21.800
But I wonder like how you win or is there a winner

21:21.800 --> 21:23.800
or everyone just uses their own special flavor?

21:23.800 --> 21:25.080
There's two things here.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.000
There's two things that are part of it.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.920
One of the things that are part of it is with chat GPT,

21:30.920 --> 21:34.680
we're all getting trained on a chat kind of interface,

21:34.680 --> 21:36.360
but more of a chat workflow

21:36.360 --> 21:39.240
where you can have a lot of different types of actions

21:39.240 --> 21:40.760
happening in one stream.

21:41.480 --> 21:43.560
And we're going to all want that.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.600
It's a way better experience.

21:44.600 --> 21:48.120
You and I collaborated on a chat GPT thread care

21:48.120 --> 21:50.440
and it was like, awesome, great experience.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.720
We're all going to want to do that more.

21:52.360 --> 21:54.680
In a world where that's true, you know who benefits?

21:55.320 --> 21:55.960
Platforms.

21:56.520 --> 21:59.480
People who have a wide set of use cases

21:59.480 --> 22:02.120
that they can bundle into that new experience

22:02.120 --> 22:05.400
and just basically put AI and that chat experience on.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.440
So I think incumbents and platforms are really going to win.

22:08.440 --> 22:11.000
And I think a lot of those point solutions right now,

22:11.560 --> 22:14.360
it's going to be a little bit like .com bus 3.0.

22:14.440 --> 22:15.720
Where they're just going,

22:15.720 --> 22:18.120
like a couple will make it and the majority will not

22:18.120 --> 22:20.360
because what they're doing will get gobbled up

22:21.000 --> 22:23.160
by a lot of the existing incumbents.

22:23.720 --> 22:24.360
Right.

22:24.360 --> 22:27.400
Matt, what tool has like other than like the open AI

22:27.400 --> 22:29.000
or the code interpreter.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.360
Me and Kip had a moment,

22:30.360 --> 22:32.520
we were doing like code interpreter live.

22:32.520 --> 22:35.320
We were kind of doing stuff analysis for the podcast and RSS.

22:35.320 --> 22:36.600
And I use these tools all the time,

22:36.600 --> 22:38.040
but I hadn't read because I'm like,

22:38.040 --> 22:39.320
maybe it's because I don't have any friends.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.120
So I hadn't used the share and function

22:42.120 --> 22:44.200
where like I'd shared this analysis with Kip.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.560
But my analysis took me two hours.

22:45.560 --> 22:46.680
Like I was going back and forth,

22:46.680 --> 22:48.120
getting it to create charts,

22:48.120 --> 22:50.440
getting it to like create tables, join tables,

22:50.440 --> 22:52.440
then create charts on those join tables.

22:52.440 --> 22:55.000
And I was like, this is like awesome, right?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.840
Like I was like, this is super awesome.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.920
But then I sent it to Kip and Kip,

22:58.920 --> 23:00.760
you can just click on the share link.

23:00.760 --> 23:04.200
You import that entire chat charts data

23:04.200 --> 23:06.120
and then you can just start like building on top of it.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.160
I didn't actually not,

23:07.160 --> 23:08.600
I thought I was sending him like a thread

23:08.600 --> 23:10.200
and he could see it and share it,

23:10.200 --> 23:11.880
but I didn't know he could just easily start

23:11.880 --> 23:13.560
to like rapidly iterate on that.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.760
And I just blown my mind

23:14.760 --> 23:16.520
because now you can just start to share these like

23:17.240 --> 23:19.480
conversations and all this stuff with someone else

23:19.480 --> 23:21.320
and they can just build on that really, really rapidly.

23:21.320 --> 23:23.160
And that was like a bit of mind-blowing experience.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.680
What's been a tool like that for you,

23:24.680 --> 23:26.600
which you're just like, holy smokes,

23:26.600 --> 23:29.560
like this is a whole new way to do things.

23:30.440 --> 23:31.640
So there's been a couple.

23:31.640 --> 23:35.480
I mean, so Anthropics Clawed 2 actually blew me away

23:35.480 --> 23:37.640
when they first made it available

23:37.640 --> 23:41.560
because of that 100,000 token context window,

23:41.560 --> 23:44.040
meaning that you can essentially upload an entire book

23:44.040 --> 23:45.880
and ask questions of that book, right?

23:45.880 --> 23:50.600
You can copy an entire giant, 100,000

23:50.600 --> 23:52.760
or 50,000 word article or something,

23:52.760 --> 23:54.360
paste it in there, ask questions of it.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.520
So Clawed 2 is really, really impressive.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.960
I've actually started using Clawed 2 almost more than ChatGPT,

23:59.960 --> 24:02.520
especially for summarization type stuff

24:02.520 --> 24:06.120
and getting bullet points and helping me rewrite stuff.

24:06.120 --> 24:10.440
But I think more, since that's sort of similar to ChatGPT,

24:10.440 --> 24:12.440
I think the one tool that really blew my mind

24:12.440 --> 24:13.880
when I did sort of a demo video on it

24:13.880 --> 24:15.640
and I was sort of playing with it in real time,

24:15.640 --> 24:18.520
that I really went, whoa, this is really crazy.

24:18.520 --> 24:19.480
It was 11 Labs.

24:19.480 --> 24:21.320
When I started playing with 11 Labs,

24:21.320 --> 24:24.200
then I was able to train my own voice into 11 Labs

24:24.200 --> 24:27.320
and then type in some text and then it spoke back to me.

24:27.320 --> 24:30.520
I actually made a video of it on my YouTube channel

24:30.520 --> 24:32.840
where I typed a bunch of words and had it speak back

24:32.840 --> 24:34.040
and I was listening to it and I'm like,

24:34.120 --> 24:36.440
yeah, I don't really think it sounds like me.

24:36.440 --> 24:37.960
And then everybody on my YouTube channel,

24:37.960 --> 24:39.400
all the comments were like,

24:39.400 --> 24:41.160
I wasn't looking at my screen at that point

24:41.160 --> 24:42.840
and I didn't realize you stopped talking.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.120
Like I had some sort of cognitive dissonance from it

24:46.120 --> 24:49.720
where I was like, that doesn't sound like me.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.600
And everybody was like, no, that's you, that's your voice.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.040
And then I started playing with it a little more

24:54.040 --> 24:57.000
where I would take a voice from somebody from a podcast

24:57.000 --> 24:59.400
and train it in there and see if I can replicate their voice.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.440
And that was working.

25:00.440 --> 25:03.320
And that to me was really, really mind blowing.

25:03.320 --> 25:05.000
Also scary at the same time, right?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.640
There's been a handful of scams that have popped up

25:07.640 --> 25:10.760
where people have called somebody's parents

25:10.760 --> 25:12.280
and then use somebody else's voice

25:12.280 --> 25:14.040
to try to get money out of the parents.

25:14.040 --> 25:17.000
And so it was one of the things where I played with it

25:17.000 --> 25:19.480
for the first time and I went, this is mind blowing.

25:19.480 --> 25:20.840
This is groundbreaking.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.760
But also this scares the hell out of me.

25:23.400 --> 25:24.680
Yeah, I watched that video.

25:24.680 --> 25:25.880
I think it was around the time, Kip,

25:25.880 --> 25:30.920
I watched you the Joe Rogan and Andrew Huberman fake podcast

25:30.920 --> 25:32.920
when they actually were doing video

25:32.920 --> 25:35.800
and then they out of the blue advertised

25:35.800 --> 25:37.320
some sort of weight loss pills.

25:38.840 --> 25:41.880
Hey, Joe, what do you think about aliens coming down

25:41.880 --> 25:43.240
and they built the pyramids?

25:43.240 --> 25:44.760
Like all the crazy stuff he talks about.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.280
Oh, but what do you think about these weight loss pills?

25:46.280 --> 25:47.160
Oh, they're super dope.

25:48.840 --> 25:51.720
But still, wow, this stuff is going to come out

25:51.720 --> 25:53.880
as pretty fast in terms of how rapidly

25:53.880 --> 25:57.480
we're going to be able to do deepfakes and spoof people.

25:57.480 --> 25:58.120
Absolutely.

25:58.120 --> 26:01.080
All right, so Claude, 11 Labs, what else?

26:01.400 --> 26:04.680
What else are your other favorite AI tools of 2023 so far?

26:04.680 --> 26:07.640
So mid-journey, every time mid-journey releases a new update,

26:07.640 --> 26:08.920
that just blows my mind.

26:08.920 --> 26:10.120
Except for it's in Discord.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.200
Are you a, you can't be a fan of the Discord experience.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.880
Like why get out of the Discord?

26:15.880 --> 26:18.120
Yeah, they are planning on getting out of the Discord.

26:18.120 --> 26:21.160
In fact, if you've generated over, I think, 10,000 generations,

26:21.160 --> 26:23.720
they let you use their web user interface.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.240
But they are moving to a web interface,

26:27.240 --> 26:29.960
but they're just, they're only letting certain beta testers

26:29.960 --> 26:30.680
use it right now.

26:30.680 --> 26:31.880
So it's getting there.

26:31.880 --> 26:33.720
I also use Leonardo AI a lot,

26:33.720 --> 26:37.240
which is another AI image generator that's really, really solid.

26:37.240 --> 26:40.120
You can actually train your own sort of styles into it.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.800
You can upload a whole bunch of images that you like,

26:41.800 --> 26:43.240
and it will train on those styles,

26:43.240 --> 26:45.640
and you can generate more images in that style.

26:45.640 --> 26:47.000
So I like that one a lot.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.520
You know, since I do a lot of YouTube videos,

26:48.520 --> 26:49.720
I like to play with a lot of like,

26:49.720 --> 26:51.080
create a video tools, right?

26:51.080 --> 26:53.080
So I use RunwayML a lot.

26:53.080 --> 26:54.920
I use a tool called Kyber a lot,

26:54.920 --> 26:58.360
which makes really cool AI image generations.

26:58.360 --> 26:59.800
It uses like Deforum,

26:59.800 --> 27:02.120
and I think DiscoDiffusion behind the scenes.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.640
I mean, there's just too many tools to list,

27:03.640 --> 27:05.560
but there's, I play with a lot of like,

27:05.560 --> 27:07.400
the visual effects type stuff,

27:07.400 --> 27:09.400
because I'm constantly experimenting with,

27:09.400 --> 27:11.640
what could I make that I can throw into a YouTube video

27:11.640 --> 27:12.360
that make people go,

27:12.360 --> 27:14.200
ooh, I need to know how he does that.

27:14.200 --> 27:18.360
The video tools are the ones where you can have an avatar

27:18.360 --> 27:20.200
within your, you're kind of go-to-market,

27:20.200 --> 27:22.200
so you have an avatar on customer support,

27:22.200 --> 27:24.680
or you have an avatar who's actually doing your sales,

27:24.680 --> 27:25.720
and there's a company called Air,

27:25.720 --> 27:26.520
they got a lot of traction,

27:26.520 --> 27:27.720
but there's other companies doing this,

27:27.720 --> 27:29.640
which is like, I can train it to sound like a human,

27:29.640 --> 27:31.800
it can do the sales, it can do the customer support,

27:31.800 --> 27:34.520
and it's like, they're like 80% there,

27:34.520 --> 27:36.600
but that 80% is nowhere near good enough, right?

27:36.600 --> 27:37.720
Like it's very monotone,

27:37.720 --> 27:40.440
it's like, you know, the videos are just like,

27:40.440 --> 27:44.360
well, this is me, I am speaking to you now,

27:44.360 --> 27:45.400
like here, right?

27:45.400 --> 27:48.520
Like they're just like, no tone, no personality.

27:48.520 --> 27:52.040
I suspect that, I wonder how hard that 20% is gonna be.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.320
I wonder if it's like one of those problems

27:53.320 --> 27:57.640
where like the 20% is just like a huge jump up

27:57.640 --> 27:58.680
from where we are today,

27:58.680 --> 28:00.840
because video is like one of the,

28:00.840 --> 28:02.360
I think most interesting spaces,

28:02.360 --> 28:04.920
runway has probably one of the best tools,

28:04.920 --> 28:06.920
but one of the ones I'm interested in is like,

28:06.920 --> 28:11.160
how rapidly you can just have a person on support 24-7,

28:11.160 --> 28:12.840
doing like your tweenshares,

28:12.840 --> 28:13.720
how you can have someone,

28:13.720 --> 28:15.960
your entire sales team like 24-7,

28:15.960 --> 28:19.800
but it doesn't seem like we're close, it seems like.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.640
I think the biggest problem with a lot of those tools

28:21.640 --> 28:23.640
is honestly just the latency between

28:23.640 --> 28:24.840
when you ask it the question,

28:24.840 --> 28:26.600
and when it responds to the question, right?

28:26.680 --> 28:27.560
Like you ask the question,

28:27.560 --> 28:28.760
there's like a 10 second gap,

28:28.760 --> 28:30.120
and then there's a response.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.680
There are some companies that are figuring that out though.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.120
There are some companies that,

28:34.120 --> 28:36.920
I was talking to the CEO of a company called Convay,

28:36.920 --> 28:40.440
who they're actually building this technology for video games,

28:40.440 --> 28:43.960
where you can go up and speak into your microphone

28:43.960 --> 28:45.800
with an NPC character,

28:45.800 --> 28:48.520
and then the character sort of generates random,

28:48.520 --> 28:49.880
real-time conversations.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.640
So every time you play through the game,

28:51.640 --> 28:53.800
you're gonna have different conversations

28:53.800 --> 28:55.480
with that character, right?

28:55.480 --> 28:57.560
So I could go up and ask them a question,

28:57.560 --> 28:59.400
one play through, the second play through.

28:59.400 --> 29:00.600
If I ask them the exact same question,

29:00.600 --> 29:01.800
they're not gonna give me the same response

29:01.800 --> 29:03.400
because it's all generated with AI.

29:03.400 --> 29:07.080
Well, his program actually fixed that latency issue

29:07.080 --> 29:09.160
where it actually has this sort of like

29:09.160 --> 29:10.680
a buffer type thing built in,

29:10.680 --> 29:12.280
where as I'm speaking,

29:12.280 --> 29:13.480
while it's hearing these words,

29:13.480 --> 29:15.240
it's already processing the words,

29:15.240 --> 29:17.400
and then when I finally pause,

29:17.400 --> 29:20.120
it's already processed the first part of what I said

29:20.120 --> 29:21.960
and is ready to respond.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.240
So they've actually figured it out

29:23.240 --> 29:25.480
where the gap between what I say

29:25.480 --> 29:29.080
and what they respond with is milliseconds.

29:29.080 --> 29:31.160
So it's, I mean, it's getting really, really close.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.080
And then with tools like 11 Labs,

29:33.080 --> 29:34.840
I feel like all those tools need to do

29:34.840 --> 29:37.800
to get rid of that sort of robotic response voice

29:37.800 --> 29:41.000
is just tie into like an API, like 11 Labs API.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.680
And now you've got a voice that sounds

29:42.680 --> 29:45.800
just like a real human that's almost indistinguishable.

29:45.800 --> 29:49.320
And then combine that with a tool like Synthesia

29:49.320 --> 29:50.120
or something like that,

29:50.120 --> 29:52.520
that actually puts that sort of human-looking avatar

29:52.600 --> 29:53.480
in front of you.

29:53.480 --> 29:55.240
So it looks like they're speaking to you

29:55.240 --> 29:57.800
and now we're crossing that unkindly valley

29:57.800 --> 30:00.840
and we've got somebody that is having a conversation,

30:00.840 --> 30:03.480
sounds like a real voice and is responding in real time.

30:03.480 --> 30:05.800
It's just the technologies all exist.

30:05.800 --> 30:08.360
I haven't just seen one tool pull them all together

30:08.360 --> 30:11.880
into a single purpose built tool for like sales.

30:11.880 --> 30:14.520
Back in my software engineer days,

30:14.520 --> 30:16.680
one of the interviews I went for like very early

30:16.680 --> 30:19.320
at a college, the person who was interviewing me

30:19.320 --> 30:22.520
like ran the entire software development department.

30:22.520 --> 30:26.200
And he purposely, and he told me like afterwards

30:26.200 --> 30:27.800
this is part of his interview style,

30:27.800 --> 30:32.120
he purposely waited 20 seconds between asking a question,

30:32.120 --> 30:33.800
you answering and him responding.

30:33.800 --> 30:37.320
So he would leave like 20 seconds of uncomfortable silence.

30:37.320 --> 30:39.400
And he said he reason, and he would just sit there like,

30:39.400 --> 30:41.240
and he would nod his head for some reason and just like,

30:42.200 --> 30:44.440
and you're like, oh, I think the reason he was like,

30:44.440 --> 30:48.520
I do that because it's incredible how people decide to like fill

30:48.520 --> 30:49.960
that 20 seconds.

30:49.960 --> 30:51.880
They just say like, you know,

30:51.880 --> 30:54.200
they just say like totally insane stuff.

30:54.200 --> 30:58.120
But I'm like, okay, like, but it's not a normal situation

30:58.120 --> 30:59.960
that I'm going to have to deal with as a software engineer.

30:59.960 --> 31:02.040
Where like part of me being a great software engineer

31:02.040 --> 31:03.960
has been able to deal with like 20 seconds,

31:03.960 --> 31:06.840
specifically 20 seconds of like uncomfortable silence.

31:06.840 --> 31:09.640
So I still think he would actually do pretty well as like

31:09.640 --> 31:12.680
an AI avatar or sales person.

31:12.680 --> 31:14.520
Yeah, yeah, I hear they do that on Shark Tank too,

31:14.520 --> 31:15.720
just to see how people respond.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.480
Yeah, I mean, yeah, once AI starts playing mental games with us,

31:19.480 --> 31:20.200
then we're all screwed.

31:22.520 --> 31:25.240
It's like, oh, come on, man, I can't deal with that.

31:25.240 --> 31:27.400
I can barely deal with it from other humans.

31:27.400 --> 31:28.760
Right, right.

31:28.760 --> 31:31.320
The last one I want to touch on both of you is

31:31.320 --> 31:33.080
this is actually Paris seems to be a real hub

31:33.080 --> 31:33.880
of these kind of companies.

31:33.880 --> 31:38.040
We talked about it, which is it feels like most companies,

31:38.040 --> 31:43.000
most large companies will have a plug and play version of a AI,

31:43.000 --> 31:45.160
like an LLM model just for them, right?

31:45.160 --> 31:47.000
Like you'll be able to plug in your data.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.320
You'll be able to like customize it for your needs.

31:49.320 --> 31:51.480
And I suspect at some point, like you'll just be able to go

31:52.280 --> 31:55.720
any kind of podcast or any YouTuber can go to a service,

31:55.720 --> 31:58.120
pay a couple of bucks, put their RSS feed,

31:58.120 --> 32:01.160
and get some like models back and be able to build apps on top of that.

32:01.720 --> 32:02.680
Are you seeing much of that?

32:02.680 --> 32:04.200
Like how do you feel about that?

32:04.200 --> 32:06.840
How do both of you think that's going to be a pretty big,

32:06.840 --> 32:08.200
a big important space?

32:08.200 --> 32:11.240
Yeah, I mean, I'm already seeing that kind of stuff that already exists.

32:11.240 --> 32:14.200
I mean, there's already apps out there that have, you know,

32:14.200 --> 32:16.840
scraped the entire Huberman Labs podcast.

32:16.840 --> 32:20.040
And you can go and have conversations with Andrew Huberman

32:20.040 --> 32:24.040
based on all of the conversations he's had on his podcast already.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.400
That sort of already exists.

32:25.400 --> 32:29.960
There's a tool that I spoke with the founder called personal.ai.

32:29.960 --> 32:34.440
And what that tool is, is you can actually plug in your own blogs, RSS feed.

32:34.440 --> 32:36.040
You can plug in your Twitter account.

32:36.040 --> 32:39.880
You can, you know, personally journal directly inside of the app.

32:39.880 --> 32:43.240
And what it does is it learns more and more and more about you.

32:43.320 --> 32:46.200
And then you can go in there and have conversations with it.

32:46.200 --> 32:50.840
And based on all of your own data, it will know how you would respond.

32:50.840 --> 32:55.880
But then you can also go and give a front end user interface to other people.

32:55.880 --> 32:59.480
So people can have a conversation with virtual digital me.

32:59.480 --> 33:04.040
Like that's already out there and there's a handful of tools that do that.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.880
I think we're going to see that more and more.

33:05.880 --> 33:09.560
I mean, I think that's probably more likely the future of customer service, right?

33:09.560 --> 33:16.680
Where you've got these AI models that are trained on all of the database of user documentation.

33:16.680 --> 33:21.800
They're trained on all of past customer support conversations and how the response was handled.

33:21.800 --> 33:28.280
And then over time, these AI bots are going to be able to handle 98.9% of the conversations

33:28.280 --> 33:33.400
that come through without ever needing to, you know, touch a human customer support rep.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.880
So that I think is coming really fast.

33:35.880 --> 33:40.040
I think that's sort of the next wave that we're going to see a lot of, honestly.

33:40.040 --> 33:43.480
Well, yeah. And it's like, when we talk about customer support,

33:43.480 --> 33:46.760
the reason I think this is important, because Kieran, I'm about to bring up

33:46.760 --> 33:51.480
one of the AI startups that you and I are most confused by to get Matt's take on.

33:52.120 --> 33:55.320
But this is me rationalizing why they might exist.

33:55.320 --> 33:59.720
You know, when we talk about, oh, AI is going to solve customer support or it's going to solve sales.

33:59.720 --> 34:05.080
The reality is humans like to interact with different types of people in those situations.

34:05.080 --> 34:09.160
Like some people want a salesperson who's really to the point.

34:09.160 --> 34:14.040
Others want somebody who's just going to be very detail oriented, et cetera.

34:14.040 --> 34:17.560
Right. And that's come, that's where you're not just going to need like one model.

34:17.560 --> 34:23.560
You're going to need very specific versions of a model to solve the audience you're trying to address.

34:23.560 --> 34:26.600
And maybe, maybe that's why character.ai exists.

34:27.160 --> 34:28.200
I don't really understand.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.000
Yeah, I don't understand.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.400
Yeah, this is a good, like what am I missing?

34:31.400 --> 34:32.440
What am I missing?

34:32.440 --> 34:33.000
What am I missing?

34:33.240 --> 34:38.200
So much money and like, it seems like people are making some weird characters,

34:38.200 --> 34:41.240
but like, are we, are we missing something about character?

34:41.240 --> 34:47.640
This is like, I feel like I'm, you know, the person watching these humans act like NPC people

34:47.640 --> 34:53.400
on TikTok doing gang gang ice cream, getting the dollars in, like, I feel that way about

34:53.400 --> 34:56.520
characters that I know, like, I'm really into the AI space.

34:56.520 --> 35:00.520
I'm like, I don't, I don't get the, I don't, what, what is this company doing?

35:00.520 --> 35:01.960
Why are they going to be huge success?

35:01.960 --> 35:03.240
Yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm with you.

35:03.240 --> 35:05.640
I don't totally understand character AI.

35:05.640 --> 35:06.840
Here's what I will say though.

35:06.840 --> 35:13.160
I do have two kids, like they're both like sort of preteen age kids and they, for whatever

35:13.160 --> 35:14.680
reason, love character AI.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.560
Like them on their phone or on the desktop.

35:17.560 --> 35:18.280
This is a part of that.

35:18.280 --> 35:19.080
I just knew I was old.

35:19.080 --> 35:20.840
So they've got their, they've got their Chromebooks.

35:20.840 --> 35:25.320
Both my kids have little Chromebooks and they get into character AI and like,

35:25.320 --> 35:27.880
we have a neighbor across the street that's the same age.

35:27.880 --> 35:34.280
And apparently among like their age kids, like middle school age kids, they love this

35:34.280 --> 35:37.000
sort of like fun digital companion thing.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.640
It's like, it's like the new Tomagachi kind of thing, right?

35:39.640 --> 35:40.360
Oh, wow.

35:40.360 --> 35:45.880
That sort of generation seems to just be obsessed with this digital companion

35:45.880 --> 35:47.400
conversation type app.

35:48.040 --> 35:49.720
That's what I've noticed about it.

35:49.720 --> 35:53.480
That's the only sort of justification I can make towards character AI.

35:53.480 --> 35:57.240
I've played with it like once or twice and went, all right, I, you know,

35:57.240 --> 35:59.000
I just had a conversation with Mega Man.

35:59.000 --> 35:59.960
That, that was cool.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.880
I don't know what else to do with this.

36:01.880 --> 36:02.760
I love Mega Man.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.680
But my kids like, they love it.

36:04.680 --> 36:07.880
They're on character AI all the time, which is scary.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.920
Hopefully that doesn't ruin, you know, real relationships and real

36:10.920 --> 36:12.200
companionship with humans.

36:12.200 --> 36:16.200
Hopefully it doesn't ruin like social skills and interpersonal skills and all the

36:16.200 --> 36:17.960
things we actually need as a society.

36:17.960 --> 36:18.360
Oh yeah.

36:18.360 --> 36:22.520
That's a whole other rabbit hole that sort of scares me about AI is the whole digital

36:22.520 --> 36:26.440
girlfriend thing that's starting to pop up where people are building relationships and

36:26.520 --> 36:30.280
not feeling the need to have real relationships with, you know, the opposite sex

36:30.280 --> 36:34.040
in real life because they've got their digital like, but that's a whole rabbit hole.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.720
That's how population continues to decline.

36:37.720 --> 36:38.200
Exactly.

36:38.200 --> 36:39.800
They're $1 billion valuation.

36:39.800 --> 36:44.440
So now we know they've, they've climbed the charts because Mega Man is on there.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.040
I think Mega Man is kind of dope.

36:46.680 --> 36:49.000
So I think that's, I think, I think that's a good case for them.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.160
They're also, and Andres and Howard's back.

36:51.160 --> 36:53.160
Matt, it's been incredible having you on the show.

36:53.160 --> 36:54.120
We're both big fans.

36:54.120 --> 36:56.360
We watch your YouTube channel.

36:56.360 --> 36:59.080
Everyone who's listening to this should go check out your YouTube channel.

36:59.080 --> 37:01.160
Keep up the date with AI every single week.

37:01.160 --> 37:03.640
And we really appreciate you coming on and spending this time with us.

37:03.640 --> 37:03.880
Yeah.

37:03.880 --> 37:04.520
Thanks for having me on.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.200
This has been absolutely a blast.

37:06.200 --> 37:07.080
I've had a good time.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.440
This data is wrong every freaking time.

37:11.320 --> 37:12.280
Have you heard of HubSpot?

37:13.480 --> 37:16.680
HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated.

37:16.680 --> 37:17.000
Whoa.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.680
I can see the clients' whole history.

37:18.680 --> 37:23.240
Calls, support tickets, emails, and here's a test from three days ago.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.360
I totally missed.

37:25.480 --> 37:27.240
HubSpot, grow better.
