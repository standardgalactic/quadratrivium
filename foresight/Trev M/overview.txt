Checking Trev M/The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Quantum Physics in Modern Mathematics -- Robbert Dijkgraaf.txt
1. The journey to becoming a mathematical physicist often starts with an early interest in science and mathematics. For Prof. Susskind, this spark was ignited at the age of 11 when he read a book on DNA and genetics, which made him realize the depth of scientific understanding that existed beyond what he had learned in school.
   
2. As a child, Prof. Susskind felt there was a conspiracy hiding the true nature of science from him, as it seemed so much more complex and fascinating than what was presented at the elementary level. He recounts his frustration with the educational system for not teaching children about atoms, the fundamental building blocks of the universe, at an earlier age.

3. By the time he was 15 or 16, Prof. Susskind had discovered both his natural inclination towards physics and mathematics and the broader world of scientific knowledge. He attributes some of this discovery to helpful high school teachers and personal exploration using resources like a mathematical encyclopedia.

4. The greatest pleasure for Prof. Susskind in being a physicist or mathematician is the independence it allows, where one can explore complex problems with just paper and pencil, driven by personal curiosity and motivation.

5. Prof. Susskind's love for science grew from a young age through self-directed learning and an intrinsic desire to understand the world around him, leading him to pursue a career in theoretical physics and mathematical research.
