Checking The Wall Street Journal/OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and CTO Mira Murati on the Future of AI and ChatGPT ｜ WSJ Tech Live 2023.txt
 Throughout history, technological advancements have consistently reshaped job markets and societal norms, with approximately every 100 years seeing significant job displacement and emergence of new roles. The current wave of AI and automation is no exception, and it's expected to bring about profound changes in the workforce over the next one to three generations.

Both Sam Altman and I agree that while this transition may be challenging, it represents progress and holds the promise of a better future for society as a whole. However, the speed of change poses a significant challenge, as many people may struggle with the prospect of their current jobs becoming obsolete. The key concern is not the absence of work, but how individuals and societies will adapt to the new realities.

There's a consensus that we need to proactively manage this transition, ensuring that people have agency and can influence the direction of change. This involves not only providing support through initiatives like universal basic income but also empowering individuals to actively participate in shaping the future.

OpenAI's approach with tools like ChatGPT is to democratize access to AI technology, enabling a broader audience to experience, understand, and contribute to the development of these technologies. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive conversation about the future and encourage people to use AI to drive positive change.

In essence, the discussion revolves around the necessity for societal preparation for job market shifts, the importance of giving people agency in their futures, and the belief that there will always be new opportunities for human expression, creativity, and contribution as we collectively navigate the evolving landscape brought about by AI advancements.
