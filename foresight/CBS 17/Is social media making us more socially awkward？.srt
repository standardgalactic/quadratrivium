1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,140
The first thing many of us do when we wake up in the morning is what?

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,620
We grab our phone.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,380
We search through our emails, our social media, all to catch up on the world while we were

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,380
sleeping.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,500
Now, this isn't an issue, but it can be if it keeps you from communicating with other

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,500
people.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,900
So, if you go to most campuses around here, you might notice students are looking down

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,820
at their phones, texting, or looking at social media instead of actually speaking to their

9
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,820
classmates.

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:34,100
Michelle McKenney, the owner of Third Degree Solutions, says all of this liking and commenting

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,700
is actually making people somewhat socially awkward.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,020
We have to start back with the social skills to get our students and our kids and our youth

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,620
and our college students, especially, to start talking and being social with each other.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,620
Coming up tonight at 5 o'clock, McKenney shares with me how you can make sure your student

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,620
at any age can still have a face-to-face conversation with people.

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,300
But it's a big problem.

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,140
A lot of people, they're just so used to texting or liking everything on social media, then

18
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,900
when they talk face-to-face, one girl says she doesn't like it because of awkward silences.

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,460
I'm like, that's so sad.

20
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,900
It's sad because you miss the experience, and you don't always know what's so insane

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,900
in text.

22
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,020
If they're really mad or happy or what's going on.
