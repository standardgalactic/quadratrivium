0	6140	The first thing many of us do when we wake up in the morning is what?
6140	7620	We grab our phone.
7620	11380	We search through our emails, our social media, all to catch up on the world while we were
11380	12380	sleeping.
12380	17500	Now, this isn't an issue, but it can be if it keeps you from communicating with other
17500	18500	people.
18500	22900	So, if you go to most campuses around here, you might notice students are looking down
22900	27820	at their phones, texting, or looking at social media instead of actually speaking to their
27820	28820	classmates.
28820	34100	Michelle McKenney, the owner of Third Degree Solutions, says all of this liking and commenting
34100	38700	is actually making people somewhat socially awkward.
38700	43020	We have to start back with the social skills to get our students and our kids and our youth
43020	48620	and our college students, especially, to start talking and being social with each other.
48620	52620	Coming up tonight at 5 o'clock, McKenney shares with me how you can make sure your student
52620	57620	at any age can still have a face-to-face conversation with people.
57620	59300	But it's a big problem.
59300	63140	A lot of people, they're just so used to texting or liking everything on social media, then
63140	66900	when they talk face-to-face, one girl says she doesn't like it because of awkward silences.
66900	68460	I'm like, that's so sad.
68460	72900	It's sad because you miss the experience, and you don't always know what's so insane
72900	73900	in text.
73900	76020	If they're really mad or happy or what's going on.
