Checking CBS 17/Is social media making us more socially awkwardï¼Ÿ.txt
 The summary of the provided text is as follows: In the morning, many people often start their day by checking their phones, scrolling through emails and social media to stay updated on events that occurred while they were asleep. While this habit isn't inherently problematic, it can lead to a lack of face-to-face interaction among individuals, particularly students on college campuses who are more likely to communicate via text or social media instead of engaging in conversation with their peers. Michelle McKenney, the owner of Third Degree Solutions, points out that excessive use of likes and comments on social media can result in social awkwardness. She emphasizes the importance of cultivating social skills among students at all ages to ensure they can comfortably engage in face-to-face conversations. The text concludes by mentioning a forthcoming segment where McKenney will discuss strategies to enhance conversational skills in individuals who are accustomed to digital communication. One of the challenges noted is that people may find real-life interactions awkward, especially when dealing with silent pauses in dialogue, which can be a missed experience and may not fully convey the intended emotions or reactions.
