The first thing many of us do when we wake up in the morning is what?

00:06.140 --> 00:07.620
We grab our phone.

00:07.620 --> 00:11.380
We search through our emails, our social media, all to catch up on the world while we were

00:11.380 --> 00:12.380
sleeping.

00:12.380 --> 00:17.500
Now, this isn't an issue, but it can be if it keeps you from communicating with other

00:17.500 --> 00:18.500
people.

00:18.500 --> 00:22.900
So, if you go to most campuses around here, you might notice students are looking down

00:22.900 --> 00:27.820
at their phones, texting, or looking at social media instead of actually speaking to their

00:27.820 --> 00:28.820
classmates.

00:28.820 --> 00:34.100
Michelle McKenney, the owner of Third Degree Solutions, says all of this liking and commenting

00:34.100 --> 00:38.700
is actually making people somewhat socially awkward.

00:38.700 --> 00:43.020
We have to start back with the social skills to get our students and our kids and our youth

00:43.020 --> 00:48.620
and our college students, especially, to start talking and being social with each other.

00:48.620 --> 00:52.620
Coming up tonight at 5 o'clock, McKenney shares with me how you can make sure your student

00:52.620 --> 00:57.620
at any age can still have a face-to-face conversation with people.

00:57.620 --> 00:59.300
But it's a big problem.

00:59.300 --> 01:03.140
A lot of people, they're just so used to texting or liking everything on social media, then

01:03.140 --> 01:06.900
when they talk face-to-face, one girl says she doesn't like it because of awkward silences.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.460
I'm like, that's so sad.

01:08.460 --> 01:12.900
It's sad because you miss the experience, and you don't always know what's so insane

01:12.900 --> 01:13.900
in text.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.020
If they're really mad or happy or what's going on.
