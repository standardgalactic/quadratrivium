Checking Big Think/Genius Is Not about Excelling at Something—It's about Doing Things Differently ｜ Eric Weinstein.txt
 The passage reflects on the societal emphasis on excellence and consensus as highly positive goals, which most people strive for in their behavior and aspirations. However, it argues that the pursuit of excellence is part of a trade-off where quality control can sometimes stifle creativity and spontaneity, particularly in contexts where innovation and improvisation are key, like jazz music. The author uses Miles Davis's "Kind of Blue" as an example of how imperfections can add to the excitement and innovation of a work.

The author suggests that while excellence can be taught through practice and dedication (as Malcolm Gladwell's "10,000 hours" theory suggests), there is a segment of the population—often labeled with learning disabilities like dyslexia or ADHD—who are not well-served by this model. These individuals are often the innovators, thinkers, and creators who bring about significant advancements in science, technology, and culture. The education system, however, is ill-equipped to cater to these differences and often labels and discourages them instead of accommodating their unique learning styles.

The author argues that society has become so fixated on the concept of excellence that it overlooks and even stigmatizes alternative ways of thinking and being, which are essential for societal progress. The author suggests that true genius often involves taking risks, embracing uncertainty, and operating in ways that seem unconventional or nonsensical until their value is proven after the fact. The author concludes by emphasizing the need to recognize and nurture these alternative modalities of thinking, which are crucial for driving societal advancement and innovation.

In summary, the passage challenges the overemphasis on excellence in society, suggesting that while it is valuable, particularly in fields like medicine and classical performance, we also need to value and cultivate the unique contributions of individuals who think differently—those who are our innovators, artists, and leaders in creating new paradigms and industries.

Checking Big Think/Social media addiction - how it changes your brain ｜ Luke Burgis ｜ Big Think.txt
 Social media has significantly altered our social and existential landscape by allowing us to directly engage with individuals, including prominent figures like the president of the United States, regardless of geographical or socioeconomic boundaries. This has created a world where we can not only interact with others but also compete with them for engagement on platforms that serve as a "memetic machine."

A meme here refers to an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture—a memetic desire is a desire adopted from another person's wishes, often unconsciously. With social media, we are now exposed to millions of such models, which has profound implications for our mental and emotional well-being. There are two types of these models:

1. **External Mediators of Desire**: These are influences that exist outside our immediate world, including both real (celebrities, leaders) and fictional characters. While we may admire or aspire to be like them, the competition or envy is less direct because they often belong to a different social sphere.

2. **Internal Mediators of Desire**: These are people within our lives—family, friends, coworkers—with whom we have more direct contact and competition. Comparison with these individuals can lead to more personal feelings of envy or rivalry.

The challenge with external mediators is that the pursuit of emulating them can be endless and relentless, leading to a dangerous cycle of unfulfilled desire. It's crucial to have positive models of desire to emulate, but it's equally important to understand the limitations of these models and to recognize when they are inflaming us with desires that may not bring true fulfillment.

The memetic landscape of social media is vast and filled with a myriad of desires modeled through images, lifestyles, fashions, speech patterns, and political views, all vying for our attention and influencing our desires. To avoid being controlled by this influx of information, it's essential to understand how these models affect us and to choose them wisely, ensuring that they contribute positively to our lives rather than leading us into cycles of dissatisfaction or unrealistic aspirations.

In summary, the pervasive influence of social media as a source of memetic models presents both opportunities and challenges for our mental and emotional health. It's vital to recognize the types of influences we are exposed to and to cultivate an awareness of how these influences impact our desires and behaviors.
