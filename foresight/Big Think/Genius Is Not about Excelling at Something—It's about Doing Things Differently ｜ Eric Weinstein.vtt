00:00.000 --> 00:12.280
I think that very few people see the words excellence or consensus as anything other

00:12.280 --> 00:14.880
than the most positive of words.

00:14.880 --> 00:18.120
These are the habits that most people seek to cultivate.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.020
They wish to be part of the consensus.

00:20.020 --> 00:27.160
They wish to be excellent in both their behavior and hope for excellent outcomes.

00:27.160 --> 00:33.520
I think the problem is that we didn't realize that excellence, so far as it goes, is fine,

00:33.520 --> 00:36.000
but it's involved in a trade-off.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.160
That trade-off has to do with the fact that excellence is really about quality control.

00:40.160 --> 00:48.000
It's about the fact that if I'm going to go for, let's say, a classical music concert,

00:48.000 --> 00:52.880
I want to assume that the piece will be played flawlessly.

00:52.880 --> 00:57.840
I will concentrate only on the interpretive aspects of the piece above that.

00:57.840 --> 01:04.760
But in fact, quality control can be deadly, for example, if in a jazz date where an improviser

01:04.760 --> 01:10.920
takes few risks, the music may be pleasant enough as background music, but it's scarcely

01:10.920 --> 01:17.000
the sort of thing that would have animated the bebop generation who played live dates

01:17.000 --> 01:20.200
under open mic conditions, never knowing what would happen next.

01:20.200 --> 01:24.680
The most famous jazz album of all time was Miles Davis's Kind of Blue.

01:24.680 --> 01:29.040
If you look at the sheet music for that date, almost nothing was written down.

01:29.040 --> 01:32.720
It was just a question of bringing the most amazing minds together.

01:32.720 --> 01:37.000
You can even hear a few flaws on that album, which make it so exciting.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.680
I think that the problem is that we have to realize that excellence is about hill climbing.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.280
It's about the fabled 10,000 hours.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.520
It's about practice making perfect.

01:46.520 --> 01:52.440
This is something that, to the credit of excellence, it's something we do know how to teach.

01:52.440 --> 01:56.080
Perhaps we don't know how to teach everyone how to achieve it, but there's always a class

01:56.080 --> 02:02.880
of people who through dedicated repetition will be able to bring their variance under

02:02.880 --> 02:08.160
extraordinary pressure so that they are reliable members of our society.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.080
We want this in our surgeons often.

02:10.080 --> 02:13.360
We want this in our classical music performers.

02:13.360 --> 02:15.560
But the question is, do we want it everywhere?

02:15.560 --> 02:20.120
Because we do know how to teach excellence, we've blinded ourselves to the role that a

02:20.120 --> 02:25.480
different thought process is involved in, which I would associate with genius.

02:25.480 --> 02:29.200
The key question is, who are these high variance individuals?

02:29.200 --> 02:32.560
Why are our schools filled with dyslexics?

02:32.560 --> 02:36.160
Why are there so many kids diagnosed with ADHD?

02:36.160 --> 02:42.960
My claim is that these are giant underserved populations who are not meant for the excellence

02:42.960 --> 02:43.960
model.

02:44.080 --> 02:48.840
They're meant to be the innovators, the people who bring us new forms of music that others

02:48.840 --> 02:52.560
will seek to perfect and hone in their performance.

02:52.560 --> 02:57.920
These are the sorts of people who bring us new scientific vistas who explore new terrain.

02:57.920 --> 03:04.080
What we've done is we've created a system which effectively demonizes these different

03:04.080 --> 03:05.080
patterns.

03:05.080 --> 03:09.120
We even call these things learning disabilities, when in fact, if you look at the learning

03:09.120 --> 03:13.480
disabled population, they very often are the most intellectual accomplished members

03:13.480 --> 03:18.800
of the society, but we put them through a torture chamber of K through 12 education,

03:18.800 --> 03:24.320
where we attempt to convince the teachers who have no idea how to serve this population.

03:24.320 --> 03:30.000
We try to make sure that there is no indication that there are teaching disabilities by pushing

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
the responsibility onto the students.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.560
These are the learning disabled, but in no real terms is this population learning disabled.

03:38.560 --> 03:45.000
It's a different and somewhat alien population that we have tried to machine to a point

03:45.000 --> 03:48.800
where they look as close to the excellent population as possible.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.720
It's not really that I'm against excellence.

03:50.720 --> 03:56.000
What I'm really against is the idea that we've absorbed the concept of excellence into the

03:56.000 --> 04:01.520
very fabric of our society, so that all those who don't function within that idiom feel

04:01.520 --> 04:06.560
that they are somehow aberrant and less than, when in fact, these are the people who are

04:06.560 --> 04:09.200
going to cure our cancers.

04:09.200 --> 04:14.400
These are the people who are going to create the new multi-billion dollar industries.

04:14.400 --> 04:19.180
In fact, the problem is, is that we don't realize that genius is really about adaptive

04:19.180 --> 04:20.560
valley crossing.

04:20.560 --> 04:25.600
It's about taking on risk, taking on cost, doing things that make almost no sense to

04:25.600 --> 04:31.480
anyone else, and can only be shown to have been sensible after the fact, because in fact,

04:31.480 --> 04:35.760
and I think Jim Watson said this beautifully, he said, if you're really going to do anything

04:35.760 --> 04:38.960
big, you are by definition unqualified to do it.

04:38.960 --> 04:46.400
The entire culture of credentialism, of professionalism is really a culture of excellence, but in

04:46.400 --> 04:50.440
fact, society is run by power laws.

04:50.440 --> 04:57.400
The very thick tales of these distributions suggest that life isn't normally distributed,

04:57.400 --> 05:03.440
but distributed by power laws, and we need a special class of people to play those tales,

05:03.440 --> 05:08.600
to get us the returns, to power us forward in advanced society, and so what I'm really

05:08.600 --> 05:15.560
interested in is not being blinded by excellence to the prospects for other modalities in particular

05:15.560 --> 05:16.000
genius.
