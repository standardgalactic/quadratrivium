1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,280
I think that very few people see the words excellence or consensus as anything other

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,880
than the most positive of words.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,120
These are the habits that most people seek to cultivate.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,020
They wish to be part of the consensus.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:27,160
They wish to be excellent in both their behavior and hope for excellent outcomes.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,520
I think the problem is that we didn't realize that excellence, so far as it goes, is fine,

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,000
but it's involved in a trade-off.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,160
That trade-off has to do with the fact that excellence is really about quality control.

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:48,000
It's about the fact that if I'm going to go for, let's say, a classical music concert,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,880
I want to assume that the piece will be played flawlessly.

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,840
I will concentrate only on the interpretive aspects of the piece above that.

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,760
But in fact, quality control can be deadly, for example, if in a jazz date where an improviser

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,920
takes few risks, the music may be pleasant enough as background music, but it's scarcely

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,000
the sort of thing that would have animated the bebop generation who played live dates

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,200
under open mic conditions, never knowing what would happen next.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,680
The most famous jazz album of all time was Miles Davis's Kind of Blue.

17
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,040
If you look at the sheet music for that date, almost nothing was written down.

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,720
It was just a question of bringing the most amazing minds together.

19
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,000
You can even hear a few flaws on that album, which make it so exciting.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,680
I think that the problem is that we have to realize that excellence is about hill climbing.

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,280
It's about the fabled 10,000 hours.

22
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,520
It's about practice making perfect.

23
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,440
This is something that, to the credit of excellence, it's something we do know how to teach.

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,080
Perhaps we don't know how to teach everyone how to achieve it, but there's always a class

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,880
of people who through dedicated repetition will be able to bring their variance under

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,160
extraordinary pressure so that they are reliable members of our society.

27
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,080
We want this in our surgeons often.

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,360
We want this in our classical music performers.

29
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,560
But the question is, do we want it everywhere?

30
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,120
Because we do know how to teach excellence, we've blinded ourselves to the role that a

31
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,480
different thought process is involved in, which I would associate with genius.

32
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,200
The key question is, who are these high variance individuals?

33
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,560
Why are our schools filled with dyslexics?

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,160
Why are there so many kids diagnosed with ADHD?

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,960
My claim is that these are giant underserved populations who are not meant for the excellence

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
model.

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,840
They're meant to be the innovators, the people who bring us new forms of music that others

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,560
will seek to perfect and hone in their performance.

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,920
These are the sorts of people who bring us new scientific vistas who explore new terrain.

40
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,080
What we've done is we've created a system which effectively demonizes these different

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
patterns.

42
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,120
We even call these things learning disabilities, when in fact, if you look at the learning

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,480
disabled population, they very often are the most intellectual accomplished members

44
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,800
of the society, but we put them through a torture chamber of K through 12 education,

45
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,320
where we attempt to convince the teachers who have no idea how to serve this population.

46
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:30,000
We try to make sure that there is no indication that there are teaching disabilities by pushing

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
the responsibility onto the students.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,560
These are the learning disabled, but in no real terms is this population learning disabled.

49
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,000
It's a different and somewhat alien population that we have tried to machine to a point

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,800
where they look as close to the excellent population as possible.

51
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,720
It's not really that I'm against excellence.

52
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,000
What I'm really against is the idea that we've absorbed the concept of excellence into the

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,520
very fabric of our society, so that all those who don't function within that idiom feel

54
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,560
that they are somehow aberrant and less than, when in fact, these are the people who are

55
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,200
going to cure our cancers.

56
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,400
These are the people who are going to create the new multi-billion dollar industries.

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,180
In fact, the problem is, is that we don't realize that genius is really about adaptive

58
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,560
valley crossing.

59
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,600
It's about taking on risk, taking on cost, doing things that make almost no sense to

60
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,480
anyone else, and can only be shown to have been sensible after the fact, because in fact,

61
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,760
and I think Jim Watson said this beautifully, he said, if you're really going to do anything

62
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,960
big, you are by definition unqualified to do it.

63
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,400
The entire culture of credentialism, of professionalism is really a culture of excellence, but in

64
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,440
fact, society is run by power laws.

65
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:57,400
The very thick tales of these distributions suggest that life isn't normally distributed,

66
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,440
but distributed by power laws, and we need a special class of people to play those tales,

67
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,600
to get us the returns, to power us forward in advanced society, and so what I'm really

68
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,560
interested in is not being blinded by excellence to the prospects for other modalities in particular

69
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,000
genius.
