1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
We all exist in this world where we can tweet at somebody or engage with somebody, could

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,080
even be the president of the United States, and they might react to us back.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,520
Social media has thrust us all onto the head of a pin, socially speaking, existentially

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,880
speaking.

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,000
Even if they're on the other side of the planet, even if they have a lot more money than we

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,200
do, we can still interact with them.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,640
We can still compete with them on engagement.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,400
They're inside of our world.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:43,360
We have a memetic machine in our pocket where all of these people exist.

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,640
So what is memetic desire?

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,680
Memetic desire means that we're adopting another person's desire as our own, usually

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,280
without even realizing that we're doing it.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,560
So social media has given us millions of memetic models that we now have to contend with.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,680
Some people have went from having 10 memetic models to now having a million, and we haven't

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:16,240
quite come to grips as a culture with what that means for our mental and emotional health.

16
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,440
There are two kinds of memetic models.

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,520
The first kind is called an external mediator of desire.

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,120
These are models that are outside of our world, whether because they exist in a different

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,400
social sphere than we do, there's no possibility of us coming into contact with them and certainly

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,280
not becoming rivals with them.

21
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,040
They're in some sense outside of our world of desire, outside of our world of competition.

22
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,600
Now these external models of desire can be real or they can be fictional.

23
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,480
The other kind of model is inside of our world called internal mediators of desire.

24
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:03,760
These are people that we do come into contact with and there is a possibility of conflict

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,720
or rivalry with these people.

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,040
These are people that are in our family, these are people in our workplace, these are people

27
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,920
that could even be our friends.

28
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,000
It's easier to compare ourselves to them.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,480
These are the kinds of people that we look to as benchmarks and we're far more likely

30
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,000
to be envious of somebody that we went to high school with who now has a great job and a

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,520
beautiful spouse than we are to be envious of the richest person in the world.

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,200
The danger with external mediators of desire, with keeping up with people that are very

33
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,520
successful, with people that have modeled a certain kind of lifestyle, is that there's

34
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,200
no end to that process.

35
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,480
All desire is a form of transcendence.

36
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,440
We desire to go beyond the boundaries, to go just over the mountain, to be the kind

37
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,720
of person that we don't feel that we currently are.

38
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,640
Having positive models of desire to emulate is a very good thing.

39
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,080
It's important to have people that model virtues and goodness that we would like, but

40
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,520
we have to understand the limitations of any model and understanding how the dynamic between

41
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,760
us and our models changes in that scenario is really, really important.

42
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,480
It's also important to understand when somebody is an internal model of desire to us because

43
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,160
in that case, we have to have boundaries.

44
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:44,760
All desire comes from us feeling like we lack something and that can bring us into a dangerous

45
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,560
vicious cycle because there will always be another model to find.

46
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,640
We have to choose our models wisely.

47
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,120
We also have to know when the model is inflaming us with a desire for something that's going

48
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:04,480
to bring real fulfillment or whether it's going to bring a dopamine hit or allow us

49
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,240
to fantasize about a life that we'll probably never have and even if we did have it, it

50
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,080
would probably make us miserable.

51
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,480
All you need to do is go on Instagram and spend five minutes and you see lifestyles

52
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,560
modeled.

53
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,960
You see vacation destinations modeled, fashions, manners of speech, ways of engagement, ways

54
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,280
of speaking, political preferences.

55
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:34,160
All of these desires are modeled for us 24 hours a day, billions of them, and we need

56
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,920
to understand the memetic landscape of social media or else we'll become totally controlled

57
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,720
by it.
