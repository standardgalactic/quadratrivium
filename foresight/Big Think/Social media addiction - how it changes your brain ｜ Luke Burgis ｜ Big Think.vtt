00:00.000 --> 00:07.280
We all exist in this world where we can tweet at somebody or engage with somebody, could

00:07.280 --> 00:13.080
even be the president of the United States, and they might react to us back.

00:13.080 --> 00:18.520
Social media has thrust us all onto the head of a pin, socially speaking, existentially

00:18.520 --> 00:19.880
speaking.

00:19.880 --> 00:24.000
Even if they're on the other side of the planet, even if they have a lot more money than we

00:24.000 --> 00:27.200
do, we can still interact with them.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.640
We can still compete with them on engagement.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.400
They're inside of our world.

00:32.400 --> 00:43.360
We have a memetic machine in our pocket where all of these people exist.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.640
So what is memetic desire?

00:46.640 --> 00:51.680
Memetic desire means that we're adopting another person's desire as our own, usually

00:51.680 --> 00:55.280
without even realizing that we're doing it.

00:55.280 --> 01:02.560
So social media has given us millions of memetic models that we now have to contend with.

01:02.560 --> 01:07.680
Some people have went from having 10 memetic models to now having a million, and we haven't

01:07.680 --> 01:16.240
quite come to grips as a culture with what that means for our mental and emotional health.

01:16.240 --> 01:19.440
There are two kinds of memetic models.

01:19.440 --> 01:24.520
The first kind is called an external mediator of desire.

01:24.520 --> 01:29.120
These are models that are outside of our world, whether because they exist in a different

01:29.120 --> 01:35.400
social sphere than we do, there's no possibility of us coming into contact with them and certainly

01:35.400 --> 01:38.280
not becoming rivals with them.

01:38.280 --> 01:44.040
They're in some sense outside of our world of desire, outside of our world of competition.

01:44.040 --> 01:50.600
Now these external models of desire can be real or they can be fictional.

01:50.600 --> 01:57.480
The other kind of model is inside of our world called internal mediators of desire.

01:57.480 --> 02:03.760
These are people that we do come into contact with and there is a possibility of conflict

02:03.760 --> 02:06.720
or rivalry with these people.

02:06.720 --> 02:11.040
These are people that are in our family, these are people in our workplace, these are people

02:11.040 --> 02:13.920
that could even be our friends.

02:13.920 --> 02:17.000
It's easier to compare ourselves to them.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.480
These are the kinds of people that we look to as benchmarks and we're far more likely

02:22.480 --> 02:28.000
to be envious of somebody that we went to high school with who now has a great job and a

02:28.000 --> 02:35.520
beautiful spouse than we are to be envious of the richest person in the world.

02:35.520 --> 02:42.200
The danger with external mediators of desire, with keeping up with people that are very

02:42.200 --> 02:46.520
successful, with people that have modeled a certain kind of lifestyle, is that there's

02:46.520 --> 02:50.200
no end to that process.

02:50.200 --> 02:54.480
All desire is a form of transcendence.

02:54.480 --> 03:00.440
We desire to go beyond the boundaries, to go just over the mountain, to be the kind

03:00.440 --> 03:04.720
of person that we don't feel that we currently are.

03:04.720 --> 03:08.640
Having positive models of desire to emulate is a very good thing.

03:08.640 --> 03:16.080
It's important to have people that model virtues and goodness that we would like, but

03:16.080 --> 03:22.520
we have to understand the limitations of any model and understanding how the dynamic between

03:22.520 --> 03:26.760
us and our models changes in that scenario is really, really important.

03:26.760 --> 03:32.480
It's also important to understand when somebody is an internal model of desire to us because

03:32.480 --> 03:37.160
in that case, we have to have boundaries.

03:37.160 --> 03:44.760
All desire comes from us feeling like we lack something and that can bring us into a dangerous

03:44.760 --> 03:50.560
vicious cycle because there will always be another model to find.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.640
We have to choose our models wisely.

03:52.640 --> 03:58.120
We also have to know when the model is inflaming us with a desire for something that's going

03:58.120 --> 04:04.480
to bring real fulfillment or whether it's going to bring a dopamine hit or allow us

04:04.560 --> 04:10.240
to fantasize about a life that we'll probably never have and even if we did have it, it

04:10.240 --> 04:13.080
would probably make us miserable.

04:13.080 --> 04:17.480
All you need to do is go on Instagram and spend five minutes and you see lifestyles

04:17.480 --> 04:18.560
modeled.

04:18.560 --> 04:24.960
You see vacation destinations modeled, fashions, manners of speech, ways of engagement, ways

04:24.960 --> 04:28.280
of speaking, political preferences.

04:28.280 --> 04:34.160
All of these desires are modeled for us 24 hours a day, billions of them, and we need

04:34.160 --> 04:39.920
to understand the memetic landscape of social media or else we'll become totally controlled

04:39.920 --> 04:41.720
by it.
