0	12280	I think that very few people see the words excellence or consensus as anything other
12280	14880	than the most positive of words.
14880	18120	These are the habits that most people seek to cultivate.
18120	20020	They wish to be part of the consensus.
20020	27160	They wish to be excellent in both their behavior and hope for excellent outcomes.
27160	33520	I think the problem is that we didn't realize that excellence, so far as it goes, is fine,
33520	36000	but it's involved in a trade-off.
36000	40160	That trade-off has to do with the fact that excellence is really about quality control.
40160	48000	It's about the fact that if I'm going to go for, let's say, a classical music concert,
48000	52880	I want to assume that the piece will be played flawlessly.
52880	57840	I will concentrate only on the interpretive aspects of the piece above that.
57840	64760	But in fact, quality control can be deadly, for example, if in a jazz date where an improviser
64760	70920	takes few risks, the music may be pleasant enough as background music, but it's scarcely
70920	77000	the sort of thing that would have animated the bebop generation who played live dates
77000	80200	under open mic conditions, never knowing what would happen next.
80200	84680	The most famous jazz album of all time was Miles Davis's Kind of Blue.
84680	89040	If you look at the sheet music for that date, almost nothing was written down.
89040	92720	It was just a question of bringing the most amazing minds together.
92720	97000	You can even hear a few flaws on that album, which make it so exciting.
97000	101680	I think that the problem is that we have to realize that excellence is about hill climbing.
101680	104280	It's about the fabled 10,000 hours.
104280	106520	It's about practice making perfect.
106520	112440	This is something that, to the credit of excellence, it's something we do know how to teach.
112440	116080	Perhaps we don't know how to teach everyone how to achieve it, but there's always a class
116080	122880	of people who through dedicated repetition will be able to bring their variance under
122880	128160	extraordinary pressure so that they are reliable members of our society.
128160	130080	We want this in our surgeons often.
130080	133360	We want this in our classical music performers.
133360	135560	But the question is, do we want it everywhere?
135560	140120	Because we do know how to teach excellence, we've blinded ourselves to the role that a
140120	145480	different thought process is involved in, which I would associate with genius.
145480	149200	The key question is, who are these high variance individuals?
149200	152560	Why are our schools filled with dyslexics?
152560	156160	Why are there so many kids diagnosed with ADHD?
156160	162960	My claim is that these are giant underserved populations who are not meant for the excellence
162960	163960	model.
164080	168840	They're meant to be the innovators, the people who bring us new forms of music that others
168840	172560	will seek to perfect and hone in their performance.
172560	177920	These are the sorts of people who bring us new scientific vistas who explore new terrain.
177920	184080	What we've done is we've created a system which effectively demonizes these different
184080	185080	patterns.
185080	189120	We even call these things learning disabilities, when in fact, if you look at the learning
189120	193480	disabled population, they very often are the most intellectual accomplished members
193480	198800	of the society, but we put them through a torture chamber of K through 12 education,
198800	204320	where we attempt to convince the teachers who have no idea how to serve this population.
204320	210000	We try to make sure that there is no indication that there are teaching disabilities by pushing
210000	213000	the responsibility onto the students.
213000	218560	These are the learning disabled, but in no real terms is this population learning disabled.
218560	225000	It's a different and somewhat alien population that we have tried to machine to a point
225000	228800	where they look as close to the excellent population as possible.
228800	230720	It's not really that I'm against excellence.
230720	236000	What I'm really against is the idea that we've absorbed the concept of excellence into the
236000	241520	very fabric of our society, so that all those who don't function within that idiom feel
241520	246560	that they are somehow aberrant and less than, when in fact, these are the people who are
246560	249200	going to cure our cancers.
249200	254400	These are the people who are going to create the new multi-billion dollar industries.
254400	259180	In fact, the problem is, is that we don't realize that genius is really about adaptive
259180	260560	valley crossing.
260560	265600	It's about taking on risk, taking on cost, doing things that make almost no sense to
265600	271480	anyone else, and can only be shown to have been sensible after the fact, because in fact,
271480	275760	and I think Jim Watson said this beautifully, he said, if you're really going to do anything
275760	278960	big, you are by definition unqualified to do it.
278960	286400	The entire culture of credentialism, of professionalism is really a culture of excellence, but in
286400	290440	fact, society is run by power laws.
290440	297400	The very thick tales of these distributions suggest that life isn't normally distributed,
297400	303440	but distributed by power laws, and we need a special class of people to play those tales,
303440	308600	to get us the returns, to power us forward in advanced society, and so what I'm really
308600	315560	interested in is not being blinded by excellence to the prospects for other modalities in particular
315560	316000	genius.
