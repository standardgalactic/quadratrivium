0	7280	We all exist in this world where we can tweet at somebody or engage with somebody, could
7280	13080	even be the president of the United States, and they might react to us back.
13080	18520	Social media has thrust us all onto the head of a pin, socially speaking, existentially
18520	19880	speaking.
19880	24000	Even if they're on the other side of the planet, even if they have a lot more money than we
24000	27200	do, we can still interact with them.
27200	30640	We can still compete with them on engagement.
30640	32400	They're inside of our world.
32400	43360	We have a memetic machine in our pocket where all of these people exist.
43360	46640	So what is memetic desire?
46640	51680	Memetic desire means that we're adopting another person's desire as our own, usually
51680	55280	without even realizing that we're doing it.
55280	62560	So social media has given us millions of memetic models that we now have to contend with.
62560	67680	Some people have went from having 10 memetic models to now having a million, and we haven't
67680	76240	quite come to grips as a culture with what that means for our mental and emotional health.
76240	79440	There are two kinds of memetic models.
79440	84520	The first kind is called an external mediator of desire.
84520	89120	These are models that are outside of our world, whether because they exist in a different
89120	95400	social sphere than we do, there's no possibility of us coming into contact with them and certainly
95400	98280	not becoming rivals with them.
98280	104040	They're in some sense outside of our world of desire, outside of our world of competition.
104040	110600	Now these external models of desire can be real or they can be fictional.
110600	117480	The other kind of model is inside of our world called internal mediators of desire.
117480	123760	These are people that we do come into contact with and there is a possibility of conflict
123760	126720	or rivalry with these people.
126720	131040	These are people that are in our family, these are people in our workplace, these are people
131040	133920	that could even be our friends.
133920	137000	It's easier to compare ourselves to them.
137000	142480	These are the kinds of people that we look to as benchmarks and we're far more likely
142480	148000	to be envious of somebody that we went to high school with who now has a great job and a
148000	155520	beautiful spouse than we are to be envious of the richest person in the world.
155520	162200	The danger with external mediators of desire, with keeping up with people that are very
162200	166520	successful, with people that have modeled a certain kind of lifestyle, is that there's
166520	170200	no end to that process.
170200	174480	All desire is a form of transcendence.
174480	180440	We desire to go beyond the boundaries, to go just over the mountain, to be the kind
180440	184720	of person that we don't feel that we currently are.
184720	188640	Having positive models of desire to emulate is a very good thing.
188640	196080	It's important to have people that model virtues and goodness that we would like, but
196080	202520	we have to understand the limitations of any model and understanding how the dynamic between
202520	206760	us and our models changes in that scenario is really, really important.
206760	212480	It's also important to understand when somebody is an internal model of desire to us because
212480	217160	in that case, we have to have boundaries.
217160	224760	All desire comes from us feeling like we lack something and that can bring us into a dangerous
224760	230560	vicious cycle because there will always be another model to find.
230560	232640	We have to choose our models wisely.
232640	238120	We also have to know when the model is inflaming us with a desire for something that's going
238120	244480	to bring real fulfillment or whether it's going to bring a dopamine hit or allow us
244560	250240	to fantasize about a life that we'll probably never have and even if we did have it, it
250240	253080	would probably make us miserable.
253080	257480	All you need to do is go on Instagram and spend five minutes and you see lifestyles
257480	258560	modeled.
258560	264960	You see vacation destinations modeled, fashions, manners of speech, ways of engagement, ways
264960	268280	of speaking, political preferences.
268280	274160	All of these desires are modeled for us 24 hours a day, billions of them, and we need
274160	279920	to understand the memetic landscape of social media or else we'll become totally controlled
279920	281720	by it.
