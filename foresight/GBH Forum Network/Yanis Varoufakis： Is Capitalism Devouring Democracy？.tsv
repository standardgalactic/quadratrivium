0	2180	Θα μπορούσα να δούμε τον Γερματικό Φινένσμι,
2180	9380	ότι είχε εξαναγωγήσει με δυνατές που έφεραν σαν λασσοπίδια.
9880	12260	Και έφεραν το παιδί και είχε πει,
12260	14440	«Αυτή η σημερινή, η σημερινή,
14440	16240	η οποία θα εξαναγωγήσω εσύ».
18240	22540	Οι εξαναγωγήσεις δεν μπορούν να αλλάξουν την οικονομική πολιτισμία.
23540	28540	Οι εξαναγωγήσεις δεν μπορούσαν να εξαναγωγήσουν την οικονομική πολιτισμία.
29540	31540	Έχω εξαναγωγήσει.
31540	33540	Η εξαναγωγήση μου ήταν,
33540	36540	«Αυτή η εξαναγωγήση για την κίνηση της Κίνησης,
36540	38540	γιατί they believed that too».
39540	41540	Και έγιναν με την προποσία,
41540	43540	αυτό είναι το reason why they hated me,
43540	45540	was to be very moderate and said,
45540	49540	«In that case, Wolfgang, let's ban elections,
49540	51540	in bankrupt countries.
51540	55540	Let's come out and declare that in the European Union
55540	59540	you can only have democracy if you are a creditor country.
59540	61540	If you are a debtor country, no democracy,
61540	64540	elections cannot be allowed to change anything,
64540	67540	because we have a loan agreement.
67540	68540	We have a debtor's prison.
68540	70540	Let's put Greece in the workhouse.
70540	71540	I didn't say all these things,
71540	74540	but I did say the thing about the Chinese Communist Party.
75540	78540	«Αν εξαναγωγήσει την κίνηση της Κίνησης,
78540	81540	γιατί they believed that if you are not able
81540	83540	to explain the economy in a language
83540	85540	which young people can understand,
85540	88540	then you are clueless yourself.
88540	91540	This from its author, Yanos Varifakis,
91540	95540	a man not only known not to mince his words,
95540	99540	but one who, in fact, wrote the book in Greek in nine days.
101540	103540	I'm Mary Stath, the director of Cambridge Forum
103540	105540	and tonight to assist us in navigating
105540	107540	the murky waters of capitalism,
107540	109540	and to quote Yanos,
109540	113540	«Come to terms with the beast that dominates our lives.
113540	115540	We are privileged to have the best of teachers,
115540	118540	a philosopher and international economist,
118540	121540	Varis Varifakis.»
121540	123540	I'm very much looking forward to the conversation
123540	124540	that we're going to have.
124540	126540	But I've been asked to give a presentation,
126540	129540	so I will, because sometimes I like to do,
129540	132540	as I'm told, not very often.
132540	135540	The title that has been advertised
135540	138540	and some of you saw it outside and walked in,
138540	141540	so I might as well honour the title,
141540	143540	is a question.
143540	146540	Is Capitalism Devouring Democracy?
146540	149540	Allow me to begin with a slightly different question.
149540	152540	Have you noticed how in the last few decades
152540	155540	the quality of politicians has stumbled?
155540	158540	Not just in this country, everywhere.
158540	162540	For God's sake, even I became a politician in 2015.
162540	166540	No, but seriously,
166540	169540	there is a marked diminution
169540	173540	in the rhetoric, in the capacity of politicians
173540	177540	to inspire and indeed in the power that they have.
177540	181540	Now, I don't believe that this is due to
181540	185540	a degeneration of the DNA of humanity
185540	189540	or of those who are interested in politics.
189540	191540	What we have been observing
191540	194540	is the shrinking of what I shall refer to
194540	197540	as the political sphere.
197540	200540	There used to be a time before capitalism
200540	204540	when there was one sphere, the sphere of power.
204540	206540	It was impossible to separate economic power
206540	208540	from political power.
208540	213540	The king had both military power,
213540	217540	military power, produced political power
217540	219540	and political power and economic power
219540	221540	were one and the same thing.
221540	223540	There is no great mystery really
223540	227540	as to why there was no economics 150 years ago.
227540	229540	The thing about Harvard University
229540	231540	did not have an economics department
231540	233540	in the 19th century, why?
233540	235540	Because there was no need for it
235540	237540	before capitalism came of age.
237540	239540	Before capitalism, the political and economic sphere
239540	241540	were one.
241540	243540	There were closures in Britain
243540	246540	that you had a remarkable transformation of society,
246540	249540	that great transformation.
249540	251540	The shifting from feudalism to capitalism.
251540	255540	Effectively, the peasants were evicted from the land,
255540	257540	replaced by sheep,
257540	260540	because of the international trade routes
260540	264540	that were creating an international market for wool
264540	267540	and some commodities like wool, like steel,
267540	271540	like spices and so on
271540	273540	were emerging as international commodities
273540	275540	with prices that were determined
275540	279540	at the level of the international trade route system.
279540	283540	All the other commodities were goods,
283540	286540	were effectively sidelined.
286540	291540	The lord of the land in Yorkshire
291540	295540	or in Manchester had absolutely no incentive
295540	297540	to retain those peasants
297540	302540	planting idiotic little vegetables
302540	304540	when they could just chuck them out of the land,
304540	306540	replace them with fat sheep,
306540	310540	whose wool suddenly had an international value,
310540	312540	exchange value.
312540	315540	But the enclosures created the working class.
315540	318540	It created the commodification of labour.
318540	320540	Up until then, people worked very hard,
320540	322540	but they didn't sell their labour.
322540	326540	We had a very interesting reversal
326540	332540	of the timing of economic production and distribution.
332540	337540	Under feudalism, we had work, production first.
337540	341540	People actually toiled, they worked the land
341540	342540	and they produced the harvest.
342540	344540	Production came first.
344540	345540	Then came distribution.
345540	348540	The lord of the land or the miner or whatever
348540	350540	would send the sheriff in
350540	354540	and take his cut from the harvest.
354540	356540	How much he would take
356540	358540	and how much he would leave behind
358540	360540	was a political issue.
360540	362540	It had to do with military power.
362540	364540	It had to do even with the benevolence of the lord.
364540	367540	It had to do with the extent to which
367540	371540	the lord needed to keep the peasants on side
371540	374540	in case another lord tried to usurp
374540	376540	his property rights over the land.
376540	379540	It was a political, diplomatic, ethical,
379540	382540	religious, economic process
382540	384540	that determined distribution after production.
384540	389540	Finally, the surplus that the lord amassed
389540	391540	was sold in nearby markets
391540	394540	and that created a financial surplus
394540	397540	for the lord which then he lent out.
397540	400540	We had production, distribution
400540	404540	and then finally finance.
404540	407540	But with the enclosures
407540	410540	and the eviction of the peasantry
410540	413540	we had the exact opposite
413540	416540	because suddenly the lord,
416540	418540	the last thing that the lord wanted to do
418540	420540	is to work or to be entrepreneurial.
420540	425540	So the replacement of the peasants with a sheep
425540	429540	meant that suddenly every acre of land
429540	432540	had an economic value, an exchange value, a price
432540	435540	that did not exist, that was not the case before.
435540	437540	Why did it acquire this price?
437540	439540	Because you knew how many sheep
439540	441540	you could raise on an acre.
441540	443540	You know how much more or less
443540	444540	wool you would produce.
444540	446540	International markets were providing
446540	448540	the equilibrium price of the wool
448540	451540	so you knew how much exchange value
451540	456540	money you could gather per acre of your land.
456540	460540	And of course then once that price was established
460540	463540	that exchange value per acre was established
463540	466540	suddenly land became a commodity
466540	469540	to be rented out, to be sold, to be purchased.
469540	471540	There was no real estate market before that.
471540	474540	Land was either you inherited land
474540	475540	in which case you had it
475540	477540	and if you never inherited land you never got it.
477540	480540	And the only way of effectively getting land
480540	483540	that you didn't have was through war, through conquest.
483540	486540	Or if the king decided to grant you
486540	487540	a plot of land.
487540	489540	There was no such thing as a market for land
489540	491540	and there was no such thing as a market of labor.
491540	494540	The enclosures, the eviction of the peasants
494540	497540	created land as a commodity
497540	499540	and of course labor as a commodity
499540	501540	because the evicted peasants
501540	504540	effectively they were roaming around the country
504540	506540	knocking on doors saying
506540	508540	I will do anything for work, for work,
508540	509540	for a piece of bread.
509540	511540	That's the first labor market.
511540	513540	That had never happened before
513540	514540	in the history of humanity.
514540	518540	People with nothing selling their labor time.
518540	520540	That's the beginning of capitalism.
520540	524540	But with this you have the separation
524540	526540	of the economic from the political sphere
526540	529540	for the first time in our history as a species.
529540	531540	Because suddenly you had merchants
531540	534540	who acquired huge power
534540	541540	through the accumulation of financial surpluses
541540	544540	because the internationalization
544540	546540	of those trade routes,
546540	548540	the emergence of these few commodities
548540	550540	as international commodities
550540	554540	that bestowed substantial financial surplus
554540	557540	upon those who handled them
557540	559540	whether they were the merchants,
559540	562540	the ship owners or the lords of the land
562540	564540	whose land now was used
564540	568540	in order to cultivate inverted commerce wool.
568540	571540	For the first time you had this separation.
571540	575540	You had lords whose political power
575540	577540	and social power
577540	579540	were now becoming increasingly
579540	581540	disproportionate to their economic power.
581540	583540	You had those dirty merchants
583540	585540	as they consider them.
585540	590540	The riffraff, the ugly dirty merchants
590540	594540	acquiring huge quantities of economic power
594540	596540	that had nothing to do with their social status.
596540	598540	They were not allowed in the palace.
598540	599540	They were not allowed in parliament.
599540	604540	They were not allowed in the gentlemen's clubs in London.
604540	607540	Suddenly they had a lot more economic power than the lords.
607540	610540	The economic and the political sphere separated.
610540	612540	With industrialization you throw into this mix
612540	615540	James Watts great invention, the steam engine
615540	617540	and this process just goes berserk.
617540	619540	You have globalization
619540	622540	which Karl Marx and Fritzrich Engels
622540	624540	in the manifesto described
624540	626540	in the most poetic language
626540	630540	when they say that capital must nestle everywhere,
630540	632540	it must settle everywhere,
632540	634540	it must enter into relations everywhere.
634540	637540	It was interesting because when Marx and Engels were writing that
637540	639540	it hadn't happened yet.
639540	642540	But they foresaw the process that we live in.
642540	644540	Globalization.
644540	648540	With globalization now we have, well,
648540	650540	with this process of globalization
650540	652540	you have the establishment of these
652540	655540	completely separate two spheres.
655540	658540	Now interestingly in the 19th century
658540	660540	you recall this.
662540	665540	Well, you live in a very historic town.
667540	673540	Liberalism was a philosophy, a political philosophy
673540	675540	at odds with democracy.
675540	678540	To be a liberal, a genuine liberal
678540	681540	you must have been very skeptical about democracy
681540	684540	if not completely and utterly anti-democratic.
684540	686540	The whole point about liberalism
686540	688540	was how to preserve the right
688540	690540	to track barter and exchange
690540	693540	in Adam Smith's famous expression
693540	697540	which was a right that many of the liberals
697540	698540	including John Stuart Mill,
698540	700540	a very liberal person,
700540	702540	a very progressive person for his age,
702540	705540	he considered the idea of democracy
705540	706540	what is democracy,
706540	708540	is the rule of the many
708540	711540	to be a great impediment
711540	713540	if not a great threat to liberalism.
713540	718540	So when we talk about liberal democracy today
718540	719540	we're talking about something
719540	720540	that in the 19th century
720540	722540	was a contradiction in terms
722540	723540	to be a liberal meant
723540	725540	that you did not believe in democracy.
727540	729540	Now what was it that brought about
729540	730540	a change, a transformation?
730540	733540	Suddenly liberals started
733540	737540	embracing the idea of democracy.
737540	738540	It was economic crisis,
738540	740540	financial and economic crisis
740540	742540	beginning especially in this country
742540	744540	in Europe in the 1840s
744540	747540	because the moment capitalism
747540	749540	started turbocharging itself
749540	754540	with the creation of what I will describe
754540	757540	as networked companies
757540	762540	with the advances in electromagnetism,
762540	766540	electric engines, the telegraph,
766540	768540	all the communication technologies,
768540	769540	electricity grids.
769540	772540	When electricity comes into production
772540	774540	and we move beyond steam
774540	776540	that's the second industrial revolution
776540	779540	to create, when Edison created his empire
779540	782540	he created a networked company.
782540	785540	Remember from the electric bulb
785540	787540	to the power generating station,
787540	790540	to the grid, everything was part of this.
790540	792540	We talk about Google now and Apple
792540	794540	as being mega companies,
794540	796540	well the mega company was invented
796540	798540	with the second industrial revolution.
798540	800540	But think about it,
800540	802540	to set up a company like Edison's
802540	805540	or later Henry Ford's and so on
805540	807540	you needed a lot of financing,
807540	809540	you needed a lot of money.
809540	814540	So suddenly the new reversed order
814540	816540	becomes very significant
816540	818540	because now ever since the peasants
818540	821540	were thrown out of the land,
821540	824540	ever since the enclosures in Britain
824540	827540	the Lord rented out,
827540	830540	leased out an acre or a few acres
830540	832540	to an ex peasant and said
832540	834540	okay, I will charge you a rent,
834540	836540	you raise the sheep here
836540	839540	and you keep the difference,
839540	841540	the residual payments.
841540	844540	So once you pay for the land,
844540	847540	me, once you pay the workers,
847540	849540	the ones that have been expelled
849540	851540	and now are working for a piece of bread,
851540	853540	subsistence wages,
853540	856540	once you pay for the sheep,
856540	859540	for the shearing, scissors,
859540	861540	whatever it is that you are using,
861540	863540	your capital equipment,
863540	865540	what you keep in the end is your profit.
865540	868540	So suddenly these proto-entrepreneurs
868540	872540	were forced, they didn't choose to do it,
872540	874540	they were forced to become entrepreneurs,
874540	876540	but how do you become an entrepreneur?
876540	878540	First you borrow,
878540	881540	and usually you borrow it from the landlord.
881540	883540	The landlord lends you the money
883540	885540	to pay him rent,
885540	887540	with interest.
887540	889540	So you see the reversal?
889540	891540	Instead of finance coming at the end,
891540	893540	we used to have production then exchange
893540	895540	or distribution and then finally finance.
895540	897540	Now we have finance first.
897540	900540	At the beginning there was the loan.
900540	902540	Once the loan comes in,
902540	904540	you hire the workers, you pay the rent,
904540	906540	immediately you have distribution.
906540	908540	So you have finance first, distribution second,
908540	910540	the last thing that happens is production.
910540	912540	So finance suddenly acquires
912540	915540	a very special place in capitalism.
915540	918540	Now the beauty and ugliness
918540	920540	of finance, of banking,
920540	924540	is that it is a magical process.
924540	927540	Because once we move from the landlord
927540	929540	to Edison and Henry Ford,
929540	932540	it is impossible to finance capitalism
932540	934540	simply by the accumulated wealth
934540	937540	of some rich person like the Lord.
937540	939540	There was never enough money
939540	941540	in the hands of any financier
941540	943540	to provide Edison with the capital,
943540	945540	with the money he needed
945540	948540	in order to set up his networked firm.
948540	952540	So you needed banks to conjure up money from nothing.
952540	954540	And this is how finance has been working
954540	956540	ever since the Second Industrial Revolution.
956540	958540	How?
958540	960540	By creating money from thin air.
960540	963540	There is a common fallacy
963540	966540	in the popular culture that we live in,
966540	969540	that banks operate like vaults.
969540	973540	Whereby you and I put our savings in
973540	976540	and somebody else goes to the bank
976540	979540	and borrows money that comes from our savings.
979540	981540	And the banker makes a profit
981540	983540	as a result of the difference
983540	985540	between the interest rate
985540	987540	that he pays us
987540	990540	for depositing our money into his vault
990540	993540	and the interest rate that he charges
993540	995540	the person that has borrowed money
995540	998540	in order to invest in a shop, in a factory, whatever.
998540	1003540	That is not what is going on.
1003540	1005540	If you go to the bank tomorrow morning
1005540	1007540	and you get a loan from the bank,
1007540	1010540	the money is going to come out of thin air.
1010540	1014540	The bank will create it out of nothing.
1014540	1016540	It's really very simple.
1016540	1019540	You get $100,000 to buy a house,
1019540	1022540	to invest in a business.
1022540	1024540	What will happen is
1024540	1026540	somebody is going to type $100,000
1026540	1030540	$100,000 into your bank account.
1030540	1032540	So it's conjured up.
1032540	1035540	The ancient Greeks had a word for money,
1035540	1037540	νόμισμα, or coin,
1037540	1039540	which comes from the verb νόμισμα,
1039540	1041540	which means to imagine.
1041540	1046540	So Aristotle defined the value of money
1046540	1049540	as a common fiction
1049540	1051540	since the ancient times.
1051540	1053540	This is exactly what it is.
1053540	1056540	So the banker simply types the money in there.
1056540	1058540	You put your card in the ATM
1058540	1060540	and suddenly you have $100,000.
1060540	1064540	Somebody typed $100,000 on the system.
1064540	1066540	Then what you can do is
1066540	1069540	you can use web banking, you can wire the money.
1069540	1072540	If you buy a car or a house,
1072540	1075540	it goes to the bank account of the vendor.
1075540	1078540	If you invest in a shop,
1078540	1080540	it goes to the landlord,
1080540	1082540	to another bank account with the same banking system.
1082540	1084540	It doesn't matter whether it's the same bank or not.
1084540	1087540	So these digits that were typed into your account
1087540	1089540	simply are transferred to another account.
1089540	1091540	That's all that happens.
1091540	1094540	Now, the hope of the banker is
1094540	1097540	that you are going to use this money productively.
1097540	1099540	You're going to earn money from that
1099540	1101540	and then you will give the banker
1101540	1104540	the money that will effectively tie up
1104540	1107540	that loose end with interest.
1107540	1109540	Now, to the extent that this works
1109540	1111540	and it really works magnificently,
1111540	1113540	in my book I relate this
1113540	1117540	in the form of a science fiction metaphor.
1117540	1119540	It's a bit like a banker
1119540	1123540	being the specially gifted magician
1123540	1125540	who has a very long arm
1125540	1128540	and can push his arm, it's usually he,
1128540	1132540	so allow me not to say she or he.
1132540	1136540	Through the timeline,
1136540	1138540	he pushes his hand into the future,
1138540	1142540	grabs value that has not been created yet,
1142540	1144540	snatches it from the future,
1144540	1146540	brings it into the present
1146540	1148540	and gives it to you.
1148540	1150540	Hopefully you do productive things
1150540	1152540	and you create a value that will repay the future.
1152540	1154540	This is my preferred metaphor
1154540	1156540	for what bankers do.
1156540	1159540	But once they learn the beauty
1159540	1162540	and the glory of doing this
1162540	1164540	and they are privileged
1164540	1166540	in a privileged spot
1166540	1168540	because they can take value from the future,
1168540	1171540	bring it to the present, they don't do any work themselves.
1171540	1173540	Because they are the mediators
1173540	1176540	between future and present value,
1176540	1178540	they are ultra-rich
1178540	1180540	and not only ultra-rich,
1180540	1183540	but central in societal processes,
1183540	1185540	political processes.
1185540	1187540	So if you do this and it works,
1187540	1189540	why not do more of it?
1189540	1191540	Keep snatching more value from the future
1191540	1193540	and bringing it to the present.
1193540	1196540	At some point, the present can no longer produce
1196540	1198540	the value that it needs to produce
1198540	1200540	in order to repay the present.
1200540	1203540	At that point, suddenly,
1203540	1205540	those of us who have borrowed money
1205540	1207540	or some of us
1207540	1209540	have no capacity to repay it,
1209540	1211540	a recession begins,
1211540	1213540	people that work for us lose their jobs,
1213540	1216540	they cannot repay their own loans
1216540	1219540	and suddenly, the book of the bank
1219540	1222540	is full of loans that are non-performing.
1222540	1225540	At that point, if you and I
1225540	1227540	or those of us who have some money in the bank
1227540	1229540	realize that this is happening,
1229540	1231540	we panic, we rush to the bank,
1231540	1233540	this is a bank run, we ask for the cash,
1233540	1235540	the cash is not there.
1235540	1237540	And then you have the financial crisis
1237540	1239540	that we had in this country
1239540	1242540	and in Europe from the 1840s onwards.
1242540	1245540	Now, to a very large extent,
1245540	1247540	the United States of America,
1247540	1249540	the way you understand your own country now,
1249540	1253540	is the product of this political response
1253540	1255540	to a sequence of financial crisis
1255540	1257540	beginning from the 1840s.
1257540	1259540	Even the creation of the Federal Reserve
1259540	1261540	in the beginning of the 20th century
1261540	1263540	was the result of J.P. Morgan saying,
1263540	1266540	I've had enough of bailing out my mates.
1266540	1268540	Let's create a Federal Reserve
1268540	1270540	that is going to be doing the job.
1270540	1272540	And of course, he created it.
1272540	1275540	It was all stitched up amongst the bankers.
1275540	1279540	Think of all the great institutions of this country,
1279540	1282540	like social security, food stamps,
1282540	1284540	they are the result of 1929.
1284540	1286540	It's what brought this nation together,
1286540	1288540	what created the United States of America,
1288540	1290540	the way you understand it.
1290540	1292540	It's a sequence of financial collapses
1292540	1296540	that puts together nations
1296540	1299540	and politics and democratic processes.
1299540	1304540	So, let me go back to the beginning.
1304540	1307540	We used to have one sphere of power.
1307540	1312540	It was political, economic, cultural, military.
1312540	1316540	Power had many different facets,
1316540	1322540	but it was one sphere in which it emerged from.
1322540	1325540	Then it separated into two spheres,
1325540	1327540	the political sphere and the economic sphere.
1327540	1331540	And as it did,
1331540	1335540	the political sphere was increasingly democratized.
1335540	1336540	Why?
1336540	1337540	Because all the important decisions
1337540	1339540	were moving to the economic sphere.
1339540	1342540	So, political legitimacy
1342540	1345540	and the capacity of the regime,
1345540	1347540	of the system that we live in,
1347540	1350540	to maintain itself and to be sustainable
1350540	1353540	through the common belief amongst the people
1353540	1356540	that this is a legitimate system,
1356540	1359540	was based on democratization of giving people the idea
1359540	1362540	that they had control over their communities,
1362540	1365540	the nation, their politics.
1365540	1368540	But this democratization was only accepted
1368540	1370540	by the proponents of liberalism
1370540	1374540	to the extent that all the important decisions
1374540	1377540	were migrating from the political sphere
1377540	1379540	as the political sphere was democratized.
1379540	1381540	Women understand that.
1381540	1385540	It's like the feminization of certain professions.
1385540	1387540	When women moved into teaching,
1387540	1389540	teaching lost its power.
1389540	1391540	When they moved into health,
1391540	1395540	increased now the majority of judges are women.
1395540	1398540	And you should see the judicial system collapsing.
1398540	1401540	So, it's a very similar process that we see.
1401540	1403540	Power is migrating from the economic sphere
1403540	1405540	to the political sphere,
1405540	1408540	and the political sphere is democratized increasingly.
1408540	1411540	Now, something fundamental happened
1411540	1414540	beginning in this country in the 1970s.
1414540	1417540	After the end of Bretton Woods,
1417540	1420540	which was what? What was Bretton Woods?
1420540	1422540	Let's not get complicated.
1422540	1425540	It was the globalization of the New Deal.
1425540	1428540	Roosevelt's New Deal in 1933,
1428540	1431540	what was the basic idea?
1431540	1433540	To put the financial genie,
1433540	1436540	the banking genie back into its bottle,
1436540	1439540	to make banking boring,
1439540	1442540	effectively to ban bankers from doing things
1442540	1446540	that allowed too much money to be created
1446540	1449540	and too many bubbles to be built up,
1449540	1452540	mobilizing idle savings,
1452540	1455540	the idle savings of the richer members of society,
1455540	1458540	and putting those idle savings,
1458540	1461540	turning them into a force in the public interest,
1461540	1465540	infrastructural works, public works,
1465540	1468540	education, social security and so on.
1468540	1470540	That was the New Deal.
1470540	1472540	But towards the end of the war,
1472540	1475540	the New Dealers extended that New Deal
1475540	1477540	internationally,
1477540	1481540	as Europe was just a pile of ashes.
1481540	1484540	Japan, you don't need me to explain
1484540	1486540	what happened to Japan in 1945.
1486540	1489540	So Bretton Woods, it was a magnificent system.
1489540	1494540	Think about it, the United States official dome in DC
1494540	1497540	effectively designed a global capitalist system
1497540	1499540	that was like a planned economy.
1499540	1501540	4% interest rates forever,
1501540	1503540	20 years of 4% interest rates,
1503540	1505540	no ups and downs, maybe,
1505540	1507540	plus or minus 0.1%.
1507540	1509540	So you knew what your mortgage rate
1509540	1512540	would be in the next 20 years.
1512540	1514540	You knew if you wanted to change
1514540	1516540	dollars for British pounds,
1516540	1518540	you knew how many pounds you would get.
1518540	1521540	You would get the same quantity year in, year out.
1521540	1523540	So it was a world which was a nightmare
1523540	1525540	for finances and of course,
1525540	1527540	that was by design.
1527540	1529540	Did you know that in the Bretton Woods
1529540	1532540	conference in New Hampshire in 1944,
1532540	1538540	Roosevelt imposed one single rule on his own.
1538540	1541540	The rest he left to his minions.
1541540	1543540	They were representatives from
1543540	1545540	100 different countries.
1545540	1547540	Most of them already,
1547540	1549540	they were not even liberated yet.
1549540	1551540	They were under occupation because it was 1944.
1551540	1553540	The Second World War had not ended.
1553540	1556540	Experts, diplomats, politicians and so on.
1556540	1559540	One species of humanity was banned
1559540	1565540	from entering the Washington Hotel bankers.
1565540	1569540	A whole monetary global system was created
1569540	1572540	on condition that bankers would not be part of it.
1572540	1574540	Yeah, interesting.
1574540	1576540	If anybody proposed this today,
1576540	1578540	they would immediately be branded as
1578540	1580540	raving communist lunatics.
1580540	1583540	This was Bretton Woods, 1944.
1583540	1586540	You know, it's important to think back
1586540	1589540	about possibilities when we think of what is possible.
1589540	1592540	Well, what happened in 1944 in Bretton Woods
1592540	1594540	in 1930, 1931 in this country
1594540	1597540	would have been completely pie in the sky.
1597540	1600540	So anyway, but that system collapsed
1600540	1603540	towards the end of the 1960s,
1603540	1606540	officially 15th of August 1971
1606540	1609540	with Nixon's announcement that it's kaput, it's finished.
1609540	1611540	I'm not going to go into this,
1611540	1614540	but what happened after that was
1614540	1619540	a very interesting, fascinating reversal
1619540	1623540	in the flow of trade and money around the world.
1623540	1626540	Before the collapse of Bretton Woods,
1626540	1627540	what was happening was this.
1627540	1629540	This is how Bretton Woods was designed.
1629540	1631540	America was a surplus country.
1631540	1633540	The country was surplus, with profits.
1635540	1637540	Especially after the Second World War,
1637540	1639540	was the only credit of the country.
1639540	1642540	They had the financial surplus, the surplus of goods
1642540	1644540	and a tax porter.
1644540	1647540	And what the United States Administration did
1647540	1649540	as part of Bretton Woods was to say,
1649540	1651540	okay, the only way of preventing a return
1651540	1654540	of the Great Depression to this land by 1949,
1654540	1656540	they were very worried about 1949
1656540	1659540	because it was 1929 plus 20.
1659540	1661540	The only way of preventing it is to make sure that,
1661540	1664540	okay, number one, we convert all the factories
1664540	1668540	from military production to civilian production,
1668540	1671540	using white goods instead of tanks and bullets,
1671540	1675540	producing cars instead of aircraft carriers.
1675540	1677540	Right, but that's not enough,
1677540	1680540	because those factories during the war economy
1680540	1683540	were so productive in this country
1683540	1686540	that they were capable of producing
1686540	1688540	so many washing machine tractors and cars
1688540	1692540	that Americans would simply not have enough use for them.
1692540	1696540	The only way of preventing the Great Depression from returning
1696540	1698540	was by selling them to the Europeans.
1698540	1700540	But the Europeans didn't have money.
1700540	1702540	So, new dealers, being very practical,
1702540	1704540	people said, we'll give them the money.
1704540	1706540	This is what's called the Marshall Aid Plan,
1706540	1708540	surplus recycling.
1708540	1710540	For 20 years, the United States was recycling
1710540	1715540	about 70% of American profits in Japan and in Europe,
1715540	1719540	because this is what you do if you are a clever hegemon.
1719540	1723540	What you do is you make sure that the only way
1723540	1725540	you can continue to have surpluses,
1725540	1728540	vis-à-vis somebody else, is to finance them.
1728540	1730540	Because if you don't, then they won't be able
1730540	1732540	to afford to buy your stuff.
1732540	1734540	Then you won't be able to have surpluses.
1734540	1736540	The problem was, however, that those surpluses
1736540	1738540	disappeared by the late 60s.
1738540	1741540	America shifted from a surplus position to a deficit position.
1741540	1743540	Both the government went in deficit
1743540	1749540	and the American economy developed a trade deficit.
1749540	1754540	It is fascinating that what happened after
1754540	1756540	the collapse of Bretton Woods had been imagined
1756540	1760540	by some smart fellows in this country.
1760540	1763540	Remember Henry Kissinger?
1763540	1766540	Yeah.
1766540	1768540	Exactly my feelings.
1768540	1773540	But he was a smart cookie, right?
1773540	1777540	In 1970, a year before the end of Bretton Woods,
1777540	1781540	he was not yet Secretary of State.
1781540	1787540	He was still head of the National Security Council.
1787540	1791540	Of course, he is a Cold Warrior, geopolitical thinker,
1791540	1794540	things in terms of a bit like Metternich would have
1794540	1797540	in the 19th century.
1797540	1801540	He comes from the same part of the world, has the same accent.
1801540	1804540	He asked all the people that were working for him
1804540	1806540	that pertinent question.
1806540	1810540	Now that the United States is shifting into a deficit position,
1810540	1812540	we used to be a...
1812540	1814540	Now we are going to become a deficit country.
1814540	1817540	How can we maintain our global hegemony?
1817540	1820540	Because it has never happened in the past.
1820540	1825540	All empires, superpowers fell once they became deficit countries
1825540	1827540	or economic blocks.
1827540	1828540	So he was worried about that.
1828540	1830540	He didn't give a damn about economics,
1830540	1832540	but he cared about power.
1832540	1837540	A young man wrote a memo.
1837540	1840540	Thick waters of a page in reply.
1840540	1842540	It was the most brilliant reply,
1842540	1844540	and the one that really explains what happened
1844540	1848540	between the 1970s and 2008 in the world
1848540	1850540	and of course in the United States.
1850540	1853540	His answer was, it doesn't really matter
1853540	1856540	whose surpluses are being recycled.
1856540	1859540	What really matters to maintain in control
1859540	1864540	is the one who is recycling other people's surpluses.
1864540	1866540	Get it?
1866540	1870540	We can maintain our superpower status, our hegemony,
1870540	1873540	as long as we do the recycling of surpluses,
1873540	1875540	even if the surpluses are not ours.
1875540	1876540	Think about it.
1876540	1881540	This is exactly the model that we have been living through
1881540	1883540	between the 1970s and 2008.
1883540	1886540	America turned into a deficit country.
1886540	1887540	The Trump is complaining,
1887540	1890540	we have a huge trade deficit with China, with Germany,
1890540	1892540	we need to eliminate it.
1892540	1895540	Either he is completely unschooled
1895540	1897540	or he is lying.
1897540	1899540	Or both.
1899540	1903540	I added the third option.
1903540	1908540	Because globalization would not have happened
1908540	1910540	without the American deficits.
1910540	1915540	The American trade deficit operated like a gigantic vacuum cleaner
1915540	1918540	but was sucking into this country
1918540	1921540	the net exports of Germany, of Holland, of France, of Japan
1921540	1923540	and later of course of China.
1923540	1928540	Keeping those factories going at full blast.
1928540	1932540	And this deficit kept increasing.
1932540	1936540	It is this increasing American trade deficit
1936540	1942540	that kept globalized capitalism in rude health.
1942540	1944540	Of course, the question then is,
1944540	1946540	how was it being paid for?
1946540	1948540	Because Greece had a big deficit
1948540	1951540	and look at what happened to us.
1951540	1953540	Well, this is the exorbitant privilege
1953540	1956540	of the United States of America.
1956540	1960540	At the very same time that the trade deficit was expanding,
1960540	1964540	the rest of the world was sending to this country
1964540	1967540	70% of all profits that Germans made,
1967540	1970540	the Dutch made, the Japanese made
1970540	1972540	and the Chinese are making.
1972540	1977540	70% of global profits were coming into Wall Street,
1977540	1980540	seeking higher returns,
1980540	1983540	being used to purchase US Treasury bills,
1983540	1985540	American government debt
1985540	1989540	and so you had a pure recycling loop.
1989540	1993540	So recycling was discovered by this young man
1993540	1996540	whose name by the way is Paul Volcker
1996540	1999540	who then became the chairman of the Fed
1999540	2002540	a week before he assumed the position of chairman of the Fed
2002540	2005540	in a lecture he gave at the University of Oregon, England.
2005540	2009540	He said, this is the time when a controlled disintegration
2009540	2012540	of the world economy is in the interest
2012540	2014540	of the United States of America, verbatim,
2014540	2017540	I've learned this off by heart because it's so exciting.
2017540	2020540	The controlled disintegration of the world economy,
2020540	2022540	so that's what he meant.
2022540	2025540	So you had this amazing system where
2025540	2028540	you have increasing imbalances globally
2028540	2031540	America growing its deficits.
2031540	2034540	Germany and Japan and then China
2034540	2036540	growing its surpluses.
2036540	2038540	When we increase our deficit,
2038540	2040540	we are creating an imbalance.
2040540	2042540	When somebody else is increasing their surplus,
2042540	2044540	that's an imbalance.
2044540	2046540	And globalization was based on this.
2046540	2048540	Financialization, what's financialization?
2048540	2050540	Why did Wall Street,
2050540	2052540	why was Wall Street allowed to go crazy?
2052540	2056540	Why were all the checks and balances
2056540	2058540	the newly dealers introduced
2058540	2060540	and Bretton Woods introduced?
2060540	2062540	Why did they go to the dogs?
2062540	2064540	Why did Larry Summers,
2064540	2066540	I believe he's got some connection with this place.
2066540	2069540	Why was he allowed to commit the crime against logic and humanity?
2069540	2072540	To unleash the Wall Street bankers
2072540	2074540	from their shackles.
2074540	2076540	The result being 2008.
2076540	2080540	The answer is, because without
2080540	2082540	unleashing the Wall Street bankers,
2082540	2085540	it was impossible to close that loop.
2085540	2089540	The only way you could have this model of the world economy
2089540	2092540	where the United States deficit
2092540	2095540	was keeping the rest of globalization going
2095540	2098540	with the rest of the world
2098540	2101540	sending its surpluses into Wall Street
2101540	2103540	for Wall Street to close the loop
2103540	2105540	and pay for the deficit
2105540	2109540	was to let the Wall Street bankers do as they pleased.
2109540	2112540	And when you do let the Wall Street bankers do as they please
2112540	2114540	you know what they do?
2114540	2117540	With a banker, a few billion every day
2117540	2119540	for five minutes
2119540	2121540	just part five billion with a banker
2121540	2123540	for five minutes every day.
2123540	2125540	This is to invite them
2125540	2128540	to create very sophisticated bets
2128540	2131540	using that five billion every day
2131540	2134540	that they are always going to win.
2134540	2137540	If I were to give you five billion every day
2137540	2139540	for five minutes you would work out ways
2139540	2142540	of making a load of money
2143540	2146540	and exponentially increasing load of money.
2146540	2148540	Anyway, the problem is that they built
2148540	2152540	so many pyramids of financialized derivatives
2152540	2154540	on top of this tsunami of capital
2154540	2156540	that the rest of the world was saying
2156540	2158540	that it combusted in 2008
2158540	2161540	and the result was what we're facing.
2161540	2164540	So, the point I'm making is that
2164540	2168540	first you had the joint sphere of power
2168540	2171540	then that bisected into the political
2171540	2173540	and economic sphere
2173540	2175540	then after the 1970s the end of Bretton Wood
2175540	2178540	the economic sphere was also divided
2178540	2181540	and multiplied between the industrial sphere
2181540	2183540	and the financial sphere.
2183540	2186540	And all power ended up with finance
2186540	2189540	because if you allow bankers to push their hand
2189540	2192540	into the future so majestically, frequently
2192540	2195540	and without any kind of control
2195540	2198540	to bring value that has not been produced yet
2198540	2201540	into the future and effectively to appropriate themselves
2201540	2203540	and then you also say to them
2203540	2206540	that they are too big to fail and when they fail
2206540	2208540	then austerity for all is combined
2208540	2210540	with socialism for the bankers
2210540	2212540	then they have no reason
2212540	2215540	why not to keep undermining capitalism
2215540	2217540	again and again and again.
2217540	2221540	So, remember the question with which I started.
2221540	2224540	Why do politicians seem to be
2224540	2226540	so much less talented today
2226540	2229540	than they were, you know, 40 years ago
2229540	2231540	20 years ago, 30 years ago?
2231540	2234540	Well, the answer is because the political sphere
2234540	2236540	is completely powerless.
2236540	2239540	The spheres that now have acquired power
2239540	2242540	are the economic sphere and magnificently the financial sphere.
2242540	2244540	So, if you're a young, talented person
2244540	2247540	who wants to change the world, who wants to do things?
2247540	2250540	Who's not very ideological or historical minded?
2250540	2252540	Who wants power?
2252540	2254540	What do you want to be president of the United States
2254540	2256540	or Goldman Sachs?
2256540	2258540	CEO of Goldman Sachs.
2258540	2261540	I remember the one long conversation,
2261540	2264540	longish conversation I had with Barack Obama
2264540	2268540	when I was the finance minister of Greece.
2268540	2271540	The first thing he said to me was
2271540	2273540	I feel solidarity for the Greek people
2273540	2275540	and we are behind you
2275540	2278540	but there's not much I can do to help.
2278540	2282540	And then he immediately, without me saying anything
2282540	2285540	he went into a solidarity justifying himself
2285540	2287540	by saying, you know, when I got elected
2287540	2289540	I realized there was nothing I could do
2289540	2291540	because Wall Street had just imploded
2291540	2293540	and I had to save them
2293540	2295540	and that was, he said, political poison for me.
2295540	2298540	Now, I don't know whether he believed it or not
2298540	2301540	and I can't see how he can explain the fact
2301540	2305540	that he appointed Larry Summers to sort out the mess
2305540	2308540	unless of course, you know, you adopt the cynical view
2308540	2312540	that it takes a murderer to work out
2312540	2316540	how the criminal justice system should be reformed.
2320540	2325540	So this is effectively the point I'm making.
2325540	2328540	So, is capitalism consistent
2328540	2336540	or sustainable within a democratic polity?
2336540	2339540	Can it coexist with democracy?
2339540	2341540	Absolutely not
2341540	2346540	because capitalism is generating this shift of power
2346540	2348540	away from the political sphere
2348540	2353540	and even if you have fantastically scripted constitutions
2353540	2357540	beautiful congresses with wonderful procedures and so on
2357540	2361540	power is going to shift away from those processes
2361540	2364540	they're going to become fig leaves for a system
2364540	2366540	where power leaves somewhere else.
2366540	2371540	In my first meeting of finance ministers in Europe
2373540	2376540	I was exposed to this harsh reality
2376540	2378540	which I always knew
2378540	2380540	but it's one thing to know it as a radical lefty
2380540	2383540	that theorizes
2383540	2388540	and puts forward various working hypotheses
2388540	2390540	in an academic environment
2390540	2393540	it's quite another to be told straight in your face.
2393540	2395540	The beauty of those few months I spent in government
2395540	2397540	was exactly that
2397540	2400540	I didn't have to theorize anymore
2400540	2404540	I went to my first meeting of the Eurogroup
2404540	2408540	the Eurogroup is the meeting of the European Union
2408540	2410540	finance ministers of the countries
2410540	2412540	that share the same currency the year
2412540	2416540	So I walked in there and I tried to be as moderate
2416540	2418540	and as sensible
2418540	2421540	and as friendly
2421540	2425540	as anyone who comes from a country that is bankrupt
2425540	2427540	and whose new government has a title
2427540	2429540	or the party that won
2429540	2432540	coalition of the radical left
2432540	2435540	So there I was the minister of finance
2435540	2437540	representing the coalition of the radical left
2437540	2440540	in that cesspool of conservatism
2440540	2442540	and I tried to be
2442540	2444540	all I said was
2444540	2449540	that we are facing a challenge
2449540	2451540	colleagues
2451540	2453540	there is the principle I said
2453540	2455540	of continuity
2455540	2457540	in democracies
2457540	2459540	in other words
2459540	2462540	we are not going to start at year zero
2462540	2464540	just because we are just elected
2464540	2466540	we have obligations to you
2466540	2468540	that previous governments, Greek governments
2468540	2470540	have assumed
2470540	2472540	and which of course we were against
2472540	2474540	our party was against but nevertheless
2474540	2478540	our state because of the principle of continuity
2478540	2480540	still has these obligations to you
2480540	2482540	and therefore I cannot dismiss them
2482540	2484540	I have to take them seriously
2484540	2486540	I am obliged by the principle of continuity
2486540	2488540	at the same time there is another principle
2488540	2491540	the principle of democracy
2491540	2494540	I could see that we didn't like that very much
2494540	2496540	and the principle of democracy is very simple
2496540	2499540	I have a mandate from the people of Greece
2499540	2501540	to challenge all these obligations
2501540	2503540	that we have in this particular fiscal
2503540	2505540	and monetary policy
2505540	2507540	that you've been imposing upon my country
2507540	2509540	which led to a great depression
2509540	2511540	which led me to be here
2511540	2513540	because if we didn't have a great depression
2513540	2515540	the Greeks were not stupid enough to vote for me
2515540	2518540	they didn't just become left wingers
2518540	2521540	our party went from 4% to 40%
2521540	2523540	in two and a half years because of the great depression
2523540	2525540	I didn't put it in those very words
2525540	2527540	but you can imagine
2527540	2529540	but more or less this was my mandate
2529540	2532540	I was trying to be extremely open to them
2532540	2535540	and moderate and conciliatory
2535540	2537540	with Wolfgang Schäuble
2537540	2539540	the finance minister of Germany
2539540	2542540	and I said what happens in democracy
2542540	2545540	when two principles clash
2545540	2547540	the principle of continuity and the principle of democracy
2547540	2549540	well we sit around the table like civilized people
2549540	2551540	and we find a compromise
2551540	2553540	this is what democracy do
2553540	2555540	liberal democracy yes
2555540	2557540	I sit down, the French minister
2557540	2559540	loved what I said
2559540	2561540	of course
2561540	2563540	just complete hot air
2563540	2566540	yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
2566540	2568540	I could see Wolfgang Schäuble
2568540	2570540	the German finance minister
2570540	2573540	he was looking at me with eyes
2573540	2576540	that felt like laser beams
2576540	2579540	and he gets the floor and he said
2579540	2581540	one sentence, one sentence
2581540	2584540	which is the one that I'm going to leave you with
2584540	2587540	elections cannot be allowed
2587540	2590540	to change economic policy
2594540	2597540	got it?
2597540	2599540	my response was
2599540	2601540	this is excellent news
2601540	2603540	to the Chinese Communist Party
2603540	2605540	because they believe that too
2605540	2607540	and I then came up with a proposal
2607540	2609540	this is why they hated me
2609540	2611540	very moderate and said
2611540	2613540	in that case Wolfgang
2613540	2615540	let's ban elections
2615540	2618540	in bankrupt countries
2618540	2621540	let's come out and declare
2621540	2623540	that in the European Union
2623540	2625540	you can only have democracy
2625540	2627540	if you are a credit or country
2627540	2629540	if you are a debt or country
2629540	2631540	no democracy, elections cannot be allowed
2631540	2633540	to change anything
2633540	2635540	because we have a loan agreement
2635540	2637540	we have a debtors prison
2637540	2639540	let's put Greece in the workhouse
2639540	2641540	I didn't say all these things
2641540	2643540	but I did say the thing about the Chinese Communist Party
2643540	2645540	and also the proposal that we
2645540	2647540	suspend elections while a country
2647540	2649540	is in the red
2649540	2651540	but I'm more honest
2651540	2653540	so the reason why I'm mentioning this is
2653540	2655540	that
2655540	2657540	Shoibley was right
2659540	2661540	in the capitalist
2661540	2663540	the globalized
2663540	2665540	financialized capitalism that we have created
2665540	2667540	elections cannot be allowed
2667540	2669540	to change economic policy
2669540	2671540	because
2671540	2673540	economic policy simply
2673540	2675540	springs out of the processes
2675540	2677540	that I described
2677540	2679540	and that leave
2679540	2681540	absolutely no room
2681540	2683540	for anything beyond a semblance
2683540	2685540	of a democratic process
2685540	2687540	that legitimizes
2687540	2689540	the lack of democracy
2689540	2691540	we live in pure ironclad
2691540	2693540	oligarchies
2693540	2695540	which require for legitimation purposes
2695540	2697540	and for their reproduction
2697540	2699540	that we think that we live in democracies
2699540	2701540	now the tragedy is
2701540	2703540	that capitalism
2703540	2705540	is being overthrown
2705540	2707540	not by the left
2707540	2709540	we are useless
2709540	2711540	progressives, left-wingers
2711540	2713540	are a catastrophe
2713540	2715540	has anybody seen
2715540	2717540	the life of Brian, Monty Python's movie
2717540	2719540	remember the opening scene
2719540	2721540	when they all hate each other
2721540	2723540	the Jews of
2723540	2725540	the liberation front of Judea
2725540	2727540	whose worst enemy is the liberation
2727540	2729540	people's front of Judea
2729540	2731540	that's the left
2731540	2733540	we are
2733540	2735540	sectarian, we hate each other
2735540	2737540	more than we hate anything else
2737540	2739540	but
2739540	2741540	and when we did overthrow capitalism
2741540	2743540	we created the gulag
2743540	2745540	so we are a disaster
2745540	2747540	doesn't mean we shouldn't
2747540	2749540	try again to do it properly and democratically
2749540	2751540	but
2751540	2753540	let's face it capitalism is overthrowing itself
2753540	2755540	with no help from us
2755540	2757540	and it's doing it in two ways
2757540	2759540	firstly
2759540	2761540	think of 2008
2761540	2763540	this financialization process
2763540	2765540	that I described
2765540	2767540	imploded under the weight
2767540	2769540	of its own hubris
2769540	2771540	and the result is a never-ending crisis
2771540	2773540	don't believe anybody who tells you that the 2008 crisis ended
2773540	2775540	it never ended
2775540	2777540	it is continuing
2777540	2779540	it is mutating
2779540	2781540	it's stating different forms
2781540	2783540	it migrates, it goes to different parts of the world
2783540	2785540	it takes, for instance in Germany
2785540	2787540	it takes the form of negative interest rates
2787540	2789540	that are eating into the pension funds
2789540	2791540	of the average middle-class person
2791540	2793540	who then turns against the political system
2793540	2795540	and votes for the fascists
2795540	2797540	of the alternative for Deutschland
2797540	2799540	they don't have an employment
2799540	2801540	but they have this sense of deflation
2801540	2803540	of their hard-earned savings
2803540	2805540	that creates
2805540	2807540	the rise of xenophobia, racism
2807540	2809540	and the ultra-right
2809540	2811540	in my country we have a Nazi party in parliament
2811540	2813540	because we have a great depression
2813540	2815540	because we have an employment rate
2815540	2817540	of 30%
2817540	2819540	and we have no interest rates
2819540	2821540	because nobody is lending to anyone
2821540	2823540	because everybody is bankrupt
2823540	2825540	in China
2825540	2827540	you have
2827540	2829540	an investment rate
2829540	2831540	the proportion of GDP
2831540	2833540	of national income
2833540	2835540	that goes into investment is gigantic
2835540	2837540	it's 48%
2837540	2839540	48 cents to every dollar
2839540	2841540	earned in China
2841540	2843540	goes into investment
2843540	2845540	now investment is a good thing
2845540	2847540	but our investment simply means
2847540	2849540	that the Chinese authorities
2849540	2851540	have given up on the West
2851540	2853540	because let's face it
2853540	2855540	the only reason why you don't have a great depression
2855540	2857540	in this country today
2857540	2859540	is because in 2008
2859540	2861540	which was our version
2861540	2863540	of 1929
2863540	2865540	two things happened differently
2865540	2867540	to what happened in 1929
2867540	2869540	one was that the Federal Reserve started printing money
2869540	2871540	as if there is no tomorrow
2871540	2873540	didn't happen in 1929
2873540	2875540	in order to rebalance global capitalism
2875540	2877540	they did it very well
2877540	2879540	but it's not sustainable
2879540	2881540	so Europe is not sustainable
2881540	2883540	China is not getting sustainable
2883540	2885540	and the United States today
2885540	2887540	which is celebrating growth
2887540	2889540	what growth? you have 2.5% growth
2889540	2891540	all the things that shouldn't grow grow
2891540	2893540	the things that should grow are not growing
2893540	2895540	you do not have
2895540	2897540	any serious investment
2897540	2899540	in good quality jobs in this country
2899540	2901540	you have wage stagnation
2901540	2903540	you have a situation
2903540	2905540	people say oh it's
2905540	2907540	this idiocy of the democratic party
2907540	2909540	that put in one the election against Hillary Clinton
2909540	2911540	come on wake up
2911540	2913540	you cannot say to Trump voters
2913540	2915540	that they're idiots
2915540	2917540	and Putin duped them
2917540	2919540	you can say that but then that's it
2919540	2921540	you lose them forever
2921540	2923540	and it's also not true
2923540	2925540	people say to me how do you explain that Trump won
2925540	2927540	I'm an economist so I look at numbers
2927540	2929540	the number that I think is most spectacular
2929540	2931540	in this country is that in 2016
2933540	2935540	more than half of the families
2935540	2937540	in this country could not afford
2937540	2939540	the cheapest new car which cost 14000
2939540	2941540	either they didn't have the money
2941540	2943540	or they didn't have the money
2943540	2945540	and they did not have the credit ratings
2945540	2947540	necessary to borrow 14000
2947540	2949540	more than half of the families cannot afford the cheapest car
2949540	2951540	that's why Trump got elected
2951540	2953540	because Obama failed
2953540	2955540	spectacularly to shift
2955540	2957540	the burdens of the crisis of the financial sector
2957540	2959540	onto the 0.1%
2961540	2963540	So
2963540	2965540	I've spoken far too long
2969540	2971540	let's end on a positive note
2973540	2975540	Shall we?
2975540	2977540	Technically
2977540	2979540	it's really very simple
2979540	2981540	how to solve the problem
2981540	2983540	or how to begin a process
2983540	2985540	we need a new deal
2985540	2987540	except that this must be an international new deal
2989540	2991540	exactly as the new deal was
2991540	2993540	in 1933
2993540	2995540	but globally
2995540	2997540	that's not new
2997540	2999540	Bretton Woods was an international new deal
2999540	3001540	so we need a new Bretton Woods
3001540	3003540	we need progressives in this country
3003540	3005540	progressives in Europe
3005540	3007540	to get an act together and start collaborating
3007540	3009540	because you know the bankers are very good
3009540	3011540	at being internationalists
3011540	3013540	they love each other
3013540	3015540	they love each other
3015540	3017540	they have very good
3017540	3019540	only we progressives
3019540	3021540	fail to get together
3021540	3023540	and start believing
3023540	3025540	that it is possible to do that which
3025540	3027540	has already been done before
3027540	3029540	it's not buying the sky stuff
3029540	3031540	now
3031540	3033540	this in order to ameliorate the effects
3033540	3035540	of the ongoing crisis after 2008
3035540	3037540	the fact is that
3037540	3039540	we need a new deal
3039540	3041540	to ameliorate the effects of the ongoing crisis
3041540	3043540	after 2008
3043540	3045540	then once we stabilize the world
3045540	3047540	like
3047540	3049540	Bretton Woods stabilized the world after the Second World War
3049540	3051540	then we can start
3051540	3053540	thinking about postcapitalism
3053540	3055540	because we must
3055540	3057540	capitalism is over turning itself
3057540	3059540	not only through its crisis
3059540	3061540	but also through the technologies that it is creating
3061540	3063540	3D printing
3063540	3065540	artificial intelligence
3065540	3067540	the internet
3067540	3069540	there will be no need to have a corporation
3069540	3071540	corporations will lack their zone
3071540	3073540	the only reason why you have general models
3073540	3075540	is the economies of scale
3075540	3077540	economies of scale are dying because of the new technologies
3077540	3079540	that capitalism is creating
3079540	3081540	so you are going to have a situation
3081540	3083540	in which
3083540	3085540	we are going to have magnificent productivity
3085540	3087540	magnificent
3087540	3089540	capacity to produce stuff
3089540	3091540	but the large majority
3091540	3093540	will not be able to buy any of it
3093540	3095540	so that will be a crisis of
3095540	3097540	not just the poor
3097540	3099540	but also the haves
3099540	3101540	but we must never
3101540	3103540	believe that because there is going to be a crisis of capitalism
3103540	3105540	because capitalism is going to undermine
3105540	3107540	and overthrow itself
3107540	3109540	good things will happen
3109540	3111540	in the 1930s
3111540	3113540	capitalism imploded
3113540	3115540	and Nazism happened
3115540	3117540	so we can have
3119540	3121540	one certainty
3121540	3123540	capitalism cannot maintain itself
3123540	3125540	something else
3125540	3127540	another system of organizing
3127540	3129540	economic and political life is going to follow
3129540	3131540	and we better make sure
3131540	3133540	that the way in which we choose
3133540	3135540	as a species, as a humanity
3135540	3137540	that different way
3137540	3139540	of doing things is selected
3139540	3141540	democratically because even though democracy
3141540	3143540	takes too long
3143540	3145540	as Oscar Wilde said socialism
3145540	3147540	would never happen because it takes too many long evenings
3149540	3151540	and it's tedious
3151540	3153540	there's no doubt about that
3153540	3155540	if you've been to a political meeting
3155540	3157540	you know how tedious it is
3157540	3159540	it's the only choice we have
3159540	3161540	thankfully we are creating the technologies
3161540	3163540	that will make these debates
3163540	3165540	both more manageable
3165540	3167540	and more hopeful in terms of
3167540	3169540	delivering a future that resembles
3169540	3171540	as I say in the book
3171540	3173540	Star Trek and not the Matrix
3173540	3175540	thank you
3181540	3183540	You're a very interesting combination
3183540	3185540	of idealism
3185540	3187540	and pragmatism
3187540	3189540	identified the problem
3189540	3191540	that we have here
3191540	3193540	which led to somehow
3193540	3195540	Trump being elected
3195540	3197540	yet
3197540	3199540	that terrible inequality
3199540	3201540	which has gotten way worse
3201540	3203540	in the last 12 months
3203540	3205540	and looks like it's going to get worse
3205540	3207540	even more get worse again
3207540	3209540	did not produce
3209540	3211540	enough people to elect Bernie Sanders
3213540	3215540	and I went to his rallies
3215540	3217540	and he said great things
3217540	3219540	do you think that this country
3219540	3221540	just can't wrap its head around
3221540	3223540	that word socialist
3223540	3225540	and that's my question
3225540	3227540	is does it have to repackage the thinking
3229540	3231540	Well
3231540	3233540	I used to think that
3233540	3235540	until Bernie Sanders called himself a socialist
3235540	3237540	and won the primary election
3237540	3239540	they were stolen from him
3239540	3241540	Bernie Sanders won the election
3241540	3243540	or he would have won the election
3243540	3245540	if the National Democratic Committee
3245540	3247540	did not do its utmost
3247540	3249540	to perform a coup d'etat against him
3249540	3251540	and I'm stating this
3251540	3253540	as an accusation
3253540	3255540	the Democratic Party
3255540	3257540	is its own worst enemy
3259540	3261540	So given that
3261540	3263540	this is the substrate that we have to work with
3263540	3265540	how do we change the thinking
3265540	3267540	if we want the things that that party
3267540	3269540	is proposing
3269540	3271540	how do we get
3271540	3273540	the electorate to change their voting
3273540	3275540	why did they vote for Trump
3275540	3277540	why
3277540	3279540	Well
3279540	3281540	firstly
3281540	3283540	the abstention rate was quite high
3283540	3285540	a lot of good people
3285540	3287540	could simply not bring themselves
3287540	3289540	to vote for Hillary
3289540	3291540	and they didn't vote at all
3291540	3293540	and many others
3293540	3295540	but
3295540	3297540	I wasn't here during your election campaign
3297540	3299540	but I was in Britain
3299540	3301540	before the Brexit referendum
3301540	3303540	and I believe that there are great similarities between the two
3303540	3305540	and I remember I was campaigning against Brexit
3305540	3307540	in Britain
3307540	3309540	in the same way I would have campaigned against Trump here
3309540	3311540	of course
3311540	3313540	and I remember asking people
3313540	3315540	who were
3315540	3317540	not racist
3317540	3319540	who were not xenophobic
3319540	3321540	who were not right-wing
3321540	3323540	why are you voting for Brexit
3323540	3325540	and the answer had nothing to do with Europe
3325540	3327540	the answer was this
3327540	3329540	if I vote
3329540	3331540	to remain
3331540	3333540	in the European Union
3333540	3335540	those bastards that have been treating me
3335540	3337540	like a discarded
3337540	3339540	piece of rag
3339540	3341540	a discarded rag
3341540	3343540	are going to be very happy
3343540	3345540	so I'm going to cast my vote in a manner
3345540	3347540	that maximizes the discomfort
3347540	3349540	of those who have been treating me
3349540	3351540	as if I'm not a human
3351540	3353540	now
3353540	3355540	I don't know
3355540	3357540	you have to tell me whether this is
3357540	3359540	an appropriate comparison
3359540	3361540	to what was going on here
3361540	3363540	a lot of people who voted for Trump
3363540	3365540	simply wanted to punish the establishment
3365540	3367540	and they wanted
3367540	3369540	I think that there is quite a lot of supporting evidence
3369540	3371540	of course there are racists
3371540	3373540	and there are Nazis
3373540	3375540	and there are right-wingers
3375540	3377540	and bigots and misogynists who voted for Trump
3377540	3379540	but they made the difference
3379540	3381540	the ones who made the difference
3381540	3383540	were the ones who could not afford the car
3383540	3385540	the ones who had believed in Obama
3385540	3387540	and who voted for Obama in 2008
3387540	3389540	from what I'm reading at the data
3389540	3391540	and there seems to be a very large number of voters
3391540	3393540	who voted for Obama in 2008
3393540	3395540	and Trump in 2016
3395540	3397540	now that cannot be explained
3397540	3399540	on the basis of racism
3399540	3401540	it cannot be explained on the basis of
3401540	3403540	misogyny
3403540	3405540	it is simply
3405540	3407540	to hell with you
3407540	3409540	I am not going to vindicate
3409540	3411540	yet again
3411540	3413540	a presidential candidate
3413540	3415540	who goes into Wall Street
3415540	3417540	six months before the presidential election
3417540	3419540	gives
3419540	3421540	private speeches for hundreds of thousands
3421540	3423540	of dollars
3423540	3425540	and
3425540	3427540	excuse the language
3427540	3429540	shits on people like me
3429540	3431540	in front of the bankers calling me names
3431540	3433540	and promising to them
3433540	3435540	that they will be allowed to continue doing that
3435540	3437540	which has put us and our country
3437540	3439540	in this position
3441540	3443540	So, trying to be optimistic
3443540	3445540	from a moment
3445540	3447540	if we were trying to create
3447540	3449540	some kind of apparatus
3449540	3451540	I mean in the 50s
3451540	3453540	Roosevelt did the very thing that they said was impossible
3453540	3455540	he put 90% tax
3455540	3457540	on corporate America
3457540	3459540	to fund all these great schemes
3459540	3461540	the social security system
3461540	3463540	you know Medicare
3463540	3465540	these things were made possible
3465540	3467540	but the workers had unions then
3467540	3469540	quite strong unions
3469540	3471540	now that's all been taken away
3471540	3473540	how are people going to
3473540	3475540	organize and overthrow the system
3475540	3477540	as you say
3477540	3479540	I mean it may implode but in the interim
3479540	3481540	people are just surviving on
3481540	3483540	ten dollar an hour wages
3483540	3485540	or not surviving
3485540	3487540	so where is the impetus for evolution
3487540	3489540	you do not need punitive tax rates now
3489540	3491540	you don't need 90%
3491540	3493540	this was a gimmick anyway
3493540	3495540	No, but it worked
3495540	3497540	Yeah, I mean it was more of a political stunt
3497540	3499540	I don't believe that it is
3499540	3501540	necessary to have such high tax rates
3501540	3503540	but what you do need
3503540	3505540	is you need to change the discourse
3505540	3507540	in a way that appeals
3507540	3509540	not only to those who would have joined
3509540	3511540	trade unions but to people who would never
3511540	3513540	have imagined themselves to be radical
3513540	3515540	or even progressive
3515540	3517540	So let me give you an example, take NAFTA
3517540	3519540	there is a lot of discussion in this country
3519540	3521540	now about NAFTA
3521540	3523540	the liberal establishment says
3523540	3525540	oh you know free trade is everything
3525540	3527540	the pie is going to shrink
3527540	3529540	if you do away with it
3529540	3531540	but some people in
3531540	3533540	the Rust Belt say
3533540	3535540	well that's your pie, that's not my pie
3535540	3537540	my pie has disappeared a long time ago
3537540	3539540	so if I can manage to hold on to a few
3539540	3541540	you know still workers jobs
3541540	3543540	by means of tariffs
3543540	3545540	let's do it because it's better
3545540	3547540	than all of us being thrown into
3547540	3549540	the dustbin
3549540	3551540	why not change the narrative
3551540	3553540	and to say
3553540	3555540	yes we want to renegotiate NAFTA
3557540	3559540	along the following lines
3559540	3561540	if Mexico wants
3561540	3563540	to continue to have
3563540	3565540	or Mexican capitalists
3565540	3567540	want to continue to have
3567540	3569540	free access to the American market
3569540	3571540	Mexico is going to have to introduce
3571540	3573540	a minimum wage in Mexico
3573540	3575540	but it provides a living wage
3575540	3577540	by Mexican standards
3577540	3579540	not by American standards
3579540	3581540	to the workers who work in the factories
3581540	3583540	that produces stuff that are then transported
3583540	3585540	over to the United States
3585540	3587540	now that is a progressive renegotiation
3587540	3589540	of NAFTA
3589540	3591540	not tariffs but minimum living wages
3591540	3593540	in the poorer countries
3593540	3595540	ok so that way
3595540	3597540	not building a wall
3597540	3599540	of course not building a wall
3599540	3601540	but then you wouldn't need to bring it to build a wall
3601540	3603540	so that is one example
3603540	3605540	take for instance
3605540	3607540	the question about the health service here
3607540	3609540	the health system
3609540	3611540	well you don't have a health system
3611540	3613540	the absence of a health system
3613540	3615540	Obamacare was a complete disaster
3615540	3617540	Obamacare
3617540	3619540	is an affront against logic
3621540	3623540	the idea of universal cover
3623540	3625540	is absolutely essential
3625540	3627540	but also the idea that
3627540	3629540	the state is going to be subsidizing
3629540	3631540	private companies to provide public health
3631540	3633540	without any controls
3633540	3635540	regarding the prices of the
3635540	3637540	services and the pharmaceuticals
3637540	3639540	is a catastrophe
3639540	3641540	it's like effectively
3641540	3643540	subsidizing the private insurance
3643540	3645540	this is why of course
3645540	3647540	they contributed massively to Obama's campaign
3649540	3651540	without the so called public option
3651540	3653540	it's ludicrous
3653540	3655540	so how about the following argument
3655540	3657540	about having
3657540	3659540	a proper national health service
3659540	3661540	a public health service system
3661540	3663540	in the United States
3663540	3665540	so that we can introduce tax cuts
3665540	3667540	think about that
3667540	3669540	that would really throw the Republicans wouldn't it
3669540	3671540	because your tax
3671540	3673540	your health system
3673540	3675540	is the most expensive in the world
3675540	3677540	you pay twice as much on health
3677540	3679540	than the rest of the world
3679540	3681540	and you have far worse outcomes
3681540	3683540	so imagine that you created a proper public system
3683540	3685540	you'd save a huge amount of money
3685540	3687540	public money
3687540	3689540	and then you could give them
3689540	3691540	give them away as tax cuts
3691540	3693540	but why not also say that
3693540	3695540	those tax cuts will go to the lowest wage
3695540	3697540	earners not to the top
3697540	3699540	so that's how you change the debate
3699540	3701540	you get out of the way
3701540	3703540	of the stereotype
3703540	3705540	that the Republicans are trying to create for you
3707540	3709540	and you subvert the dominant way of thinking
3709540	3711540	So I would like to hug the questioning
3711540	3713540	but I don't think it's fair
3713540	3715540	because I'm sure there are lots of good questions
3715540	3717540	that are going to come from the audience
3717540	3719540	so I'm going to open up the questions
3719540	3721540	and if you could confine it to one
3721540	3723540	I would be appreciative
3723540	3725540	It may be one and a half
3725540	3727540	I thought for a minute your talk was going to be almost entirely about Harvard
3727540	3729540	Marshall
3729540	3731540	who announced it at Harvard commencement
3731540	3733540	Kissinger
3733540	3735540	and then Larry Summers
3735540	3737540	I'd say
3737540	3739540	have this idea that maybe Obama was
3739540	3741540	put in the White House
3741540	3743540	to bail out Harvard
3743540	3745540	that whose endowment went from
3745540	3747540	losing 11 billion to regaining it
3749540	3751540	I think many people in this country
3751540	3753540	are still not convinced
3753540	3755540	that Obama did have a choice
3755540	3757540	Now you said
3757540	3759540	I believe that he did
3759540	3761540	but can you be a little more specific about
3761540	3763540	and you sort of writ large
3763540	3765540	you talk about a new deal
3765540	3767540	but are you more specific about what
3767540	3769540	a person in the White House
3769540	3771540	could have done
3771540	3773540	what it would have looked like
3773540	3775540	that would have been more like bailing out Wall Street
3775540	3777540	more like bailing out Main Street
3777540	3779540	than bailing out Wall Street
3779540	3781540	and can you explain
3781540	3783540	why the social democratic politics
3783540	3785540	of building a politics
3785540	3787540	where we control the government
3787540	3789540	and regulate capitalism
3789540	3791540	is not the way to go
3791540	3793540	but some other alternative politics
3793540	3795540	is what you're implying
3795540	3797540	but you haven't really I don't think spelled out
3797540	3799540	Ok, I'll start from the second part
3799540	3801540	Look
3801540	3803540	the new deal that I am suggesting
3803540	3805540	as a first step
3805540	3807540	is social democratic
3807540	3809540	but in the good old fashioned sense
3809540	3811540	of it
3811540	3813540	so you need social democratic measures
3813540	3815540	to stabilize the political economy
3815540	3817540	before we can have a genuine conversation
3817540	3819540	about what comes next
3819540	3821540	the more radical part
3821540	3823540	for instance changing corporate law
3823540	3825540	I mean corporate law
3825540	3827540	is a political value judgment
3827540	3829540	so when some corporation
3829540	3831540	goes bust
3831540	3833540	who gets paid first
3833540	3835540	amongst the creditors
3835540	3837540	is a political decision
3837540	3839540	so why not change it
3839540	3841540	why have the bankers get paid first
3841540	3843540	and the workers last
3843540	3845540	why allow people to own shares
3845540	3847540	in a company in which they don't work
3847540	3849540	this is very radical I don't know
3849540	3851540	where you can only have shares in a company
3851540	3853540	in which you actually provide labor
3853540	3855540	then you have socialism
3855540	3857540	but without state control
3857540	3859540	so that's the second
3859540	3861540	part of the second question
3861540	3863540	but let's go back to Obama, did he have a choice
3863540	3865540	of course he had a choice
3865540	3867540	he could have appointed as
3867540	3869540	instead of appointing
3869540	3871540	team guide there and Larry Summers
3871540	3873540	he could have appointed Elizabeth Warren
3873540	3875540	with a mandate
3875540	3877540	to save the banks
3877540	3879540	or operate the bankers
3879540	3881540	which is not a new idea
3881540	3883540	in 1992
3883540	3885540	the Swedish banks
3885540	3887540	actually all the Scandinavian banks went bust
3887540	3889540	and what the governments did then
3889540	3891540	was to say to the bankers ok, out
3891540	3893540	they took over the banks, they nationalized them
3893540	3895540	put in a new board of directors
3895540	3897540	and within two years
3897540	3899540	they had sold them back to the private sector
3899540	3901540	but cleansed, the original bankers had gone
3901540	3903540	with new regulations
3903540	3905540	he didn't do that
3905540	3907540	he left Jamie Dimon
3907540	3909540	Goldman Sachs
3909540	3911540	intact all the structures of power
3911540	3913540	in 2009
3913540	3915540	when he moved into the White House
3915540	3917540	for about six to eight months
3917540	3919540	I grant you
3919540	3921540	not more than that
3921540	3923540	he had a window of opportunity
3923540	3925540	he had a whole nation behind him
3925540	3927540	he could have done that
3927540	3929540	even libertarians would have approved
3929540	3931540	of expropriating the bankers
3931540	3933540	he didn't
3933540	3935540	but it was him
3935540	3937540	to create the so called
3937540	3939540	Summers Geithner plan
3939540	3941540	if you haven't studied that
3941540	3943540	go and study it
3943540	3945540	it is a remarkable
3945540	3947540	ingenious way
3947540	3949540	of
3949540	3951540	conjuring up
3951540	3953540	around nine trillion dollars
3953540	3955540	and giving it to the bankers without anybody realizing it
3957540	3959540	you remember the bailout that Hank Paulson came up with
3959540	3961540	was 700 billion
3961540	3963540	initially he was defeated
3963540	3965540	in congress
3965540	3967540	and then he managed to push it through
3967540	3969540	700 billion spinnets
3969540	3971540	Geithner and Summers
3971540	3973540	created nine trillion
3973540	3975540	without anybody realizing it
3975540	3977540	ok
3977540	3979540	so Obama had a choice to do it
3979540	3981540	and he did it
3981540	3983540	now we are paying for it
3983540	3985540	because Trump is president
3987540	3989540	I've been very concerned
3989540	3991540	lately about China
3991540	3993540	and sort of there
3993540	3995540	we have transferred so much money
3995540	3997540	from our economy
3997540	3999540	over to China
3999540	4001540	by buying all those things
4001540	4003540	and supporting their economy over there
4003540	4005540	so they could make more and more money
4005540	4007540	they are now all over
4007540	4009540	Africa
4009540	4011540	buying things and
4011540	4013540	investing over there
4013540	4015540	and getting those countries dependent on them
4015540	4017540	and supporting
4017540	4019540	these democratic people
4019540	4021540	and I'm just wondering
4021540	4023540	like whom
4023540	4025540	we are in a country that supports Saudi Arabia
4025540	4027540	yes that's true
4027540	4029540	suddenly we have a problem
4029540	4031540	with
4031540	4033540	superpowers supporting non-democratic people
4035540	4037540	yes I mean yes I do
4037540	4039540	but I also am concerned
4039540	4041540	that we've sort of created
4041540	4043540	the economic power that China
4043540	4045540	sort of has now and they are using it
4045540	4047540	I fear
4047540	4049540	I'm going to be using it against us eventually
4049540	4051540	and against
4051540	4053540	the better interests of a lot of people
4053540	4055540	allow me to put your mind to rest
4055540	4057540	you shouldn't worry about that
4057540	4059540	ok
4059540	4061540	very simple
4061540	4063540	and let me explain why you shouldn't worry about that
4063540	4065540	but please continue
4065540	4067540	I mean
4069540	4071540	you know
4071540	4073540	they are in Africa
4073540	4075540	they are making money to countries to build ports
4075540	4077540	and different infrastructure
4077540	4079540	and what's wrong with that
4079540	4081540	countries that need ports
4081540	4083540	get ports
4083540	4085540	but they are making people dependent on
4085540	4087540	I mean I know it's the same thing that we've done
4087540	4089540	which is affordable around the world
4089540	4091540	they are far more humanistic
4091540	4093540	than the United States ever was
4093540	4095540	really? ok
4095540	4097540	let me give you an example
4097540	4099540	of course they are peddling
4099540	4101540	for influence
4101540	4103540	but they are non-interventionists
4103540	4105540	absolutely non-interventionists
4105540	4107540	in a way that Europeans
4107540	4109540	the West has never managed to fathom
4109540	4111540	but I have a feeling
4111540	4113540	they have a longer term thought process
4113540	4115540	that is more
4115540	4117540	but let's judge what we see
4117540	4119540	let's start at the beginning
4123540	4125540	the Chinese never asked Apple
4125540	4127540	to go to Shenzhen
4127540	4129540	produce all the iPhones
4129540	4131540	because Steve Jobs have decided that
4133540	4135540	it was not China
4135540	4137540	that
4139540	4141540	went to Washington DC
4141540	4143540	and demanded
4143540	4145540	that they buy a third of your national debt
4147540	4149540	if they hadn't bought it
4149540	4151540	you would be in serious trouble
4151540	4153540	number three
4153540	4155540	I did allude to this
4155540	4157540	in my talk
4157540	4159540	in 2008 China had not cranked up
4159540	4161540	their credit bubble
4161540	4163540	you would be in a great depression
4163540	4165540	now
4165540	4167540	so China
4167540	4169540	the United States and the European Union
4169540	4171540	are absolutely
4171540	4173540	synergistic
4173540	4175540	and they need one another
4175540	4177540	in a way that
4177540	4179540	if we
4179540	4181540	failed to acknowledge and to nurture
4183540	4185540	billions of people
4185540	4187540	including
4187540	4189540	the majority of the people in this country
4189540	4191540	are going to suffer
4191540	4193540	now
4193540	4195540	I am not going to stand here
4195540	4197540	and defend China
4197540	4199540	and the Chinese Communist Party
4199540	4201540	I already made some negative remarks
4201540	4203540	about the Chinese Communist Party
4203540	4205540	in referring to
4205540	4207540	their attitudes as being
4207540	4209540	compatible
4209540	4211540	with those of Wolfgang Schroeble
4211540	4213540	my concern about China
4213540	4215540	is the
4215540	4217540	authoritarian manner
4217540	4219540	in which the Chinese regime
4219540	4221540	is treating the Chinese people
4221540	4223540	as a democrat, I have a problem with this
4223540	4225540	mind you
4225540	4227540	I have to tell you that
4227540	4229540	from my understanding of China
4229540	4231540	it's a very interesting social experiment
4231540	4233540	in the sense that
4233540	4235540	at the local level
4235540	4237540	the regional level
4237540	4239540	you now have a boisterous democracy
4239540	4241540	at the local and regional level
4241540	4243540	even with
4243540	4245540	popular
4245540	4247540	success stories in overthrowing
4247540	4249540	local
4249540	4251540	authorities, local
4251540	4253540	bureaucrats who have been corrupt
4253540	4255540	who have been this, who have been that, who have been the other
4257540	4259540	when it comes to the
4259540	4261540	influence of China outside
4261540	4263540	its borders, I have to say
4263540	4265540	firstly, it's quite remarkable that they
4265540	4267540	don't seem to have any military
4267540	4269540	ambitions
4269540	4271540	secondly
4271540	4273540	Africa
4273540	4275540	I'll give you an example
4275540	4277540	a specific example
4277540	4279540	Ethiopia
4279540	4281540	2004, because it happened to be there
4281540	4283540	and I have some
4283540	4285540	first-person
4285540	4287540	first-hand experience of it
4287540	4289540	they went into Ethiopia
4289540	4291540	I'll tell you why they went into Ethiopia
4291540	4293540	because they suspected it was oil
4293540	4295540	because China is
4295540	4297540	a major industrial power
4297540	4299540	but it lacks primary resources
4299540	4301540	now, instead of going
4301540	4303540	into Africa with troops
4303540	4305540	colonially destroying the country
4305540	4307540	killing people like the west has done
4307540	4309540	for the last 100 years
4309540	4311540	what they did was, they went to
4311540	4313540	Adithababa and they said to the government
4313540	4315540	we would like, we can see
4315540	4317540	you have problems with your infrastructure
4317540	4319540	we would like to build some new airports
4321540	4323540	upgrade your railway system
4323540	4325540	create a telephone system
4325540	4327540	and rebuild your roads
4327540	4329540	and we'll do this all for free
4329540	4331540	no strings attached, we don't want
4331540	4333540	anything from you
4333540	4335540	and they did, why did they do it?
4335540	4337540	because it's soft power
4337540	4339540	now, because they knew
4339540	4341540	that if oil is
4341540	4343540	discovered, and it was discovered later
4343540	4345540	then
4345540	4347540	of course, the Ethiopian government
4347540	4349540	will be much more open to Chinese
4349540	4351540	oil companies coming there
4351540	4353540	they have never combined
4353540	4355540	their investment
4355540	4357540	with imperialistic
4359540	4361540	when I was minister of finance
4361540	4363540	I had a very interesting
4363540	4365540	experience with Costco
4365540	4367540	one of the Chinese national companies
4367540	4369540	that in the end bought the port of Piraeus
4373540	4375540	when I moved into the ministry
4375540	4377540	I found a contract
4377540	4379540	from the previous government
4379540	4381540	the port of Piraeus
4381540	4383540	for a pittance and other ridiculous conditions
4383540	4385540	to the Chinese
4385540	4387540	under the guidance
4387540	4389540	of course of the European Union and International Monetary Fund
4389540	4391540	as well
4391540	4393540	and in other ways I was
4393540	4395540	as a minister I was
4395540	4397540	bound to a particular
4397540	4399540	deal that was terrible for Greece
4399540	4401540	and I went to the Chinese
4401540	4403540	and discussed it with them
4403540	4405540	and I was really astonished
4405540	4407540	I said to them look, you're paying too little
4407540	4409540	you're not committing to a sufficient
4409540	4411540	level of investment
4411540	4413540	and you are treating our workers
4413540	4415540	as fodder
4415540	4417540	you are effectively subcontracting labor
4417540	4419540	to horrible companies
4419540	4421540	that exploit the workers
4421540	4423540	and I can't deal with this
4423540	4425540	effectively
4425540	4427540	I proposed to them
4427540	4429540	to renegotiate the contract
4429540	4431540	so instead of getting 67% of the shares
4431540	4433540	of the port they would get with the same price
4433540	4435540	51%
4435540	4437540	the remaining shares would go into
4437540	4439540	the Greek pension fund system
4439540	4441540	in order to bolster
4441540	4443540	the capitalization of the public pensions
4443540	4445540	secondly
4445540	4447540	I want you to commit
4447540	4449540	to 180 million euros
4449540	4451540	of investment within 12 months
4451540	4453540	and thirdly
4453540	4455540	proper collective bargaining with the trade unions
4455540	4457540	and no subcontracting of labor
4457540	4459540	and to my astonishment
4459540	4461540	they said ok
4461540	4463540	can you imagine if that was a German company
4463540	4465540	or an American company
4465540	4467540	that's what I'm saying, I don't think you should worry
4467540	4469540	ok, I won't
4475540	4477540	hi
4477540	4479540	hi, big fan Janis
4479540	4481540	nice to see you in person
4481540	4483540	and I hope you don't mind that I'll struggle
4483540	4485540	to give you a short question
4485540	4487540	instead of an essay
4487540	4489540	so basically
4489540	4491540	one angle that
4491540	4493540	was missing from tonight's talk
4493540	4495540	is the angle of
4495540	4497540	class formations
4497540	4499540	so the new deal was born out of
4499540	4501540	I believe
4501540	4503540	about easily 50-60 years
4503540	4505540	of left wing organizing
4505540	4507540	among the industrial working classes
4507540	4509540	who basically
4509540	4511540	as we would always say on our slogans
4511540	4513540	had their hands on the wheels
4513540	4515540	when they went on strike they could stop production
4515540	4517540	stop the flow of profits
4517540	4519540	and so on and so on
4519540	4521540	by the time the Great Depression came
4521540	4523540	there was a crisis
4523540	4525540	there was a place for labor
4525540	4527540	and the left at the bargaining table
4527540	4529540	I guess
4529540	4531540	what I want to ask is
4531540	4533540	let's take neoliberalism at a kind of good faith
4533540	4535540	and say there really was a change
4535540	4537540	in the class formation
4537540	4539540	that allowed them to just throw out Bretton Woods
4539540	4541540	and say we don't want to commit to this deal anymore
4541540	4543540	you don't have the power
4543540	4545540	effectively your bargaining terms
4545540	4547540	oh laborers are not so good anymore
4547540	4549540	so then
4549540	4551540	that leaves us today
4551540	4553540	where are we
4553540	4555540	who does have their hands on the wheel
4555540	4557540	I mean
4557540	4559540	here we are Cambridge, Massachusetts
4559540	4561540	large portion of the population works in
4561540	4563540	white collar professions
4563540	4565540	many of them are homeowners
4565540	4567540	in traditional
4567540	4569540	there aren't a lot of traditional industrial workers
4569540	4571540	in this room
4571540	4573540	on the other hand the traditional industrial workers
4573540	4575540	in Ohio or wherever
4575540	4577540	are losing their jobs quite rapidly
4577540	4579540	due to mechanization
4579540	4581540	and offshoring
4581540	4583540	so
4583540	4585540	who can put the worker's gun
4585540	4587540	to the capitalist class's head anymore
4589540	4591540	good question
4591540	4593540	but I have to disagree with you on one thing
4593540	4595540	and sorry to sound a bit tanky on you
4595540	4597540	no no no you're not tanky
4597540	4599540	it is the pertinent question
4599540	4601540	the one you asked
4601540	4603540	I don't have a
4603540	4605540	splendid answer to it
4605540	4607540	but where I want to disagree with you
4607540	4609540	is that in 1933
4609540	4611540	or 32
4611540	4613540	it was the labor movement
4613540	4615540	that imposed
4615540	4617540	its will using its power
4617540	4619540	there was no power
4619540	4621540	the 1929 great
4621540	4623540	the great crash and then the depression that followed
4623540	4625540	completely depleted
4625540	4627540	trade unions of any bargaining power
4627540	4629540	when you have a situation
4629540	4631540	where you've got hordes of people
4631540	4633540	outside the factory gates
4633540	4635540	begging to be allowed into work
4635540	4637540	at any wage
4637540	4639540	you don't have trade union power
4639540	4641540	so it was a political process
4641540	4643540	that led
4643540	4645540	not a labor process
4645540	4647540	that led to the new deal
4647540	4649540	and let's not forget that FDR was not a revolutionary leader
4649540	4651540	he was a patrician
4651540	4653540	he was a bourgeois
4653540	4655540	even Keynes
4655540	4657540	but Keynes
4657540	4659540	Keynes hated the workers
4659540	4661540	trade unions
4661540	4663540	the reason why he introduced Keynesian economics
4663540	4665540	his proposals
4665540	4667540	which included increasing wages
4667540	4669540	and welfare states
4669540	4671540	and
4671540	4673540	fiscal spending
4673540	4675540	fiscal stimulus and so on
4675540	4677540	was very simple
4677540	4679540	he wanted to preserve capitalism
4679540	4681540	and he understood that capitalism was not very good at preserving itself
4681540	4683540	that's a very large part
4683540	4685540	of the motivation of Roosevelt
4685540	4687540	it was not that he was being pushed
4687540	4689540	by the industrial might
4689540	4691540	of the labor unions
4691540	4693540	so that gives you a bit of hope
4693540	4695540	since that didn't happen then
4695540	4697540	maybe we don't need
4697540	4699540	strong trade unions today
4699540	4701540	today I think that
4701540	4703540	from a class formation point of view
4703540	4705540	what is me
4705540	4707540	and what I think is the
4707540	4709540	the
4709540	4711540	should be the objective
4711540	4713540	is how to organize
4713540	4715540	the precariat
4715540	4717540	those who live precarious existence
4717540	4719540	the uberized workers
4719540	4721540	into a political force
4721540	4723540	because they now are
4723540	4725540	falling through the cracks of society
4725540	4727540	they are like the lumpenproletariat used to be
4727540	4729540	they are disappearing
4729540	4731540	I mean
4731540	4733540	a person who works
4733540	4735540	18 hours a day in an uber
4735540	4737540	is not a person
4737540	4739540	it's a lost soul
4739540	4741540	it's a moving
4741540	4743540	monument to
4743540	4745540	to misanthropy
4745540	4747540	so that for me
4747540	4749540	is a major question
4749540	4751540	but
4751540	4753540	allow me just to be
4753540	4755540	to shift in towards
4755540	4757540	something that may sound science fiction
4757540	4759540	but I don't think it is
4759540	4761540	we need to think
4763540	4765540	innovatively about collective action
4765540	4767540	I do not believe
4767540	4769540	that the revolution is going to come through trade unions
4769540	4771540	in industrial sites
4771540	4773540	but simply because they are fading
4773540	4775540	unless the robots organize
4775540	4777540	and they do the revolution on our behalf
4777540	4779540	you never know
4779540	4781540	I've read the science fiction novel
4781540	4783540	where the computer in the end
4783540	4785540	organized the revolution
4787540	4789540	but
4789540	4791540	let me give you an example
4791540	4793540	today you have
4793540	4795540	millions of people
4795540	4797540	who are being exploited
4797540	4799540	by public utility companies
4799540	4801540	being privatized
4801540	4803540	and which are financialized
4803540	4805540	and they have already
4805540	4807540	sold to financiers
4807540	4809540	the next 20 years
4809540	4811540	of the electricity bills that you will be paying
4811540	4813540	and as a result
4813540	4815540	of this financialization
4815540	4817540	your bill is going up and up and up
4817540	4819540	completely disproportionately to the cost
4819540	4821540	of producing electricity, water, whatever
4821540	4823540	what if
4823540	4825540	we could work out
4825540	4827540	which financial derivatives
4827540	4829540	or CDOs
4831540	4833540	are packaging
4833540	4835540	the bills in a particular neighborhood
4835540	4837540	and another neighborhood
4837540	4839540	and we organize through the internet
4839540	4841540	so that we can have
4841540	4843540	an electricity bill payment strike
4843540	4845540	that is timed in such a way
4845540	4847540	as to explode those CDOs
4847540	4849540	and make them bankrupt
4849540	4851540	now that's a form of collective action
4851540	4853540	which is using the financial instruments
4853540	4855540	of
4855540	4857540	this kind of network
4857540	4859540	against it
4859540	4861540	we need to think beyond
4861540	4863540	modern times Charlie Chaplin
4863540	4865540	thank you very much
4865540	4867540	very interesting stuff
4867540	4869540	Kelly Spetta
4869540	4871540	that's all the Greek I know
4871540	4873540	so
4873540	4875540	I originally
4875540	4877540	tried to do a PhD on
4877540	4879540	the topic you talked
4879540	4881540	about the separation between
4881540	4883540	political power and economic power
4883540	4885540	specifically about the European Union
4885540	4887540	and how it sort of formalized
4887540	4889540	this split between the political spheres
4889540	4891540	no longer has to do anything
4891540	4893540	with what the people want
4893540	4895540	with the economic organization
4895540	4897540	no one wanted to touch that one with the 10 foot pole
4897540	4899540	so I'm doing something else now
4899540	4901540	but it made my passion
4901540	4903540	but to keep the question reasonably short
4903540	4905540	what is the one change
4905540	4907540	one of the many changes you'd like to see
4907540	4909540	in the structure of the European Union
4909540	4911540	that could address this
4911540	4913540	right well
4913540	4915540	I'll be very
4915540	4917540	brief in my response
4917540	4919540	we need to federate
4919540	4921540	because there are only two choices here
4921540	4923540	either we break it up
4923540	4925540	which many people want
4925540	4927540	even on the left
4927540	4929540	thinking that
4929540	4931540	recoiling into the bosom of the nation state
4931540	4933540	is somehow going to allow them
4933540	4935540	to create socialism in one country
4935540	4937540	yeah right
4937540	4939540	yeah
4939540	4941540	but you have to create
4941540	4943540	a democratic union
4943540	4945540	now the problem is
4945540	4947540	that with this crisis
4947540	4949540	that we have which is both
4949540	4951540	economic and political
4951540	4953540	and moral if you want
4953540	4955540	we can't have a serious discussion
4955540	4957540	about federation
4957540	4959540	because we have centrifugal forces
4959540	4961540	that are pulling us apart
4961540	4963540	so this is why our movement
4963540	4965540	you may have heard of a movement
4965540	4967540	that I'm part of, DM25
4967540	4969540	proposing what we call a European New Deal
4969540	4971540	a new deal
4971540	4973540	in order to stabilize
4973540	4975540	and bring hope back so that we can have a discussion
4975540	4977540	on how to federate
4977540	4979540	thank you very much
4979540	4981540	I'm also going to ask
4981540	4983540	a question about the European Union
4983540	4985540	and about Greece
4985540	4987540	and about
4987540	4989540	the immigration problem
4989540	4991540	which is all the more
4991540	4993540	on everyone's mind
4993540	4995540	because of everyone's
4995540	4997540	because of what Trump has just done
4997540	4999540	with wiping out
4999540	5001540	the
5001540	5003540	agreement
5003540	5005540	on
5005540	5007540	the Iranian
5007540	5009540	nuclear situation
5009540	5011540	I
5011540	5013540	recently read
5013540	5015540	that on the island of Lesbos
5015540	5017540	I believe
5017540	5019540	which is an island that receives
5019540	5021540	a lot of the
5021540	5023540	immigrants from the Middle East, Syria
5023540	5025540	that Greeks
5025540	5027540	were attacking
5027540	5029540	the immigrants
5029540	5031540	and I read
5031540	5033540	that
5033540	5035540	I have read
5035540	5037540	for years now that conditions
5037540	5039540	in the camps are terrible
5039540	5041540	and something
5041540	5043540	that I have wondered about
5043540	5045540	for years is
5045540	5047540	why is it
5047540	5049540	the immigrants from
5049540	5051540	the Middle East and North Africa
5051540	5053540	coming to the south
5053540	5055540	of Europe
5055540	5057540	the poorest part of Europe
5057540	5059540	and
5059540	5061540	why is it that there is not
5061540	5063540	some common effort
5063540	5065540	perhaps this is a very naive question
5065540	5067540	but some common effort
5067540	5069540	to subsidize
5069540	5071540	countries like Greece
5071540	5073540	which is in
5073540	5075540	terrible economic straits
5075540	5077540	to deal
5077540	5079540	more humanely
5079540	5081540	with these people
5081540	5083540	that's a fantastic question
5083540	5085540	ok let's
5085540	5087540	let me answer in three parts
5087540	5089540	firstly inform you about what's going on in Lesbos
5089540	5091540	because Lesbos is very
5091540	5093540	dear to us
5093540	5095540	as Greeks to our hearts
5095540	5097540	and we are
5097540	5099540	devastated by what's going on
5099540	5101540	firstly let me be
5101540	5103540	fair to the people of Lesbos
5103540	5105540	the vast majority of the people of Lesbos
5105540	5107540	have been magnificent
5107540	5109540	for three years now
5109540	5111540	it's an island that is very depressed
5111540	5113540	financially economically
5113540	5115540	it's a bit like Detroit
5115540	5117540	and you have a million people
5117540	5119540	it's an island of 17,000 people
5119540	5121540	and a million people came
5121540	5123540	and most of them passed through
5123540	5125540	now we have 50,000 left
5125540	5127540	and they went on the shore
5127540	5129540	they picked them up
5129540	5131540	they opened their houses
5131540	5133540	they opened their shops and gave them food
5133540	5135540	of course for no money and so on
5135540	5137540	but the vast majority
5137540	5139540	of course when you have a combination
5139540	5141540	of
5141540	5143540	the great depression that we have
5143540	5145540	in Greece you have Nazis
5145540	5147540	and add to this
5147540	5149540	the European Union's
5149540	5151540	attitude
5151540	5153540	which is effective to turn Lesbos into a concentration camp
5153540	5155540	and the people of
5155540	5157540	the Greeks who live there
5157540	5159540	then become very susceptible
5159540	5161540	to the toxic narrative of the Greek Nazis
5161540	5163540	who say to them see
5163540	5165540	these bastards came here
5165540	5167540	and now we are
5167540	5169540	instead of being a beautiful Greek
5169540	5171540	a Greek island receiving tourists
5171540	5173540	and doing well
5173540	5175540	we are ourselves part of a concentration camp
5175540	5177540	so it's very difficult to fight against this narrative
5177540	5179540	but
5179540	5181540	to tell you what I think
5181540	5183540	so
5183540	5185540	the situation on the ground
5185540	5187540	there are three camps
5187540	5189540	one is called Moria
5189540	5191540	it is the most notorious one
5191540	5193540	a camp that can hold
5193540	5195540	under reasonable conditions
5195540	5197540	not good but the reasonable
5197540	5199540	2,000 people there are 10,000 people
5199540	5201540	so they live in
5201540	5203540	circumstances that do not
5203540	5205540	be fit a civilized
5205540	5207540	part of the world
5207540	5209540	but that's on purpose
5209540	5211540	it is run by the European Union
5211540	5213540	and the United Nations
5213540	5215540	and it is
5215540	5217540	accessible of misery
5217540	5219540	on purpose
5219540	5221540	from coming
5221540	5223540	there are another two camps
5223540	5225540	that local NGOs have created
5225540	5227540	and they are magnificent
5227540	5229540	they are absolutely magnificent
5229540	5231540	if you look at the circumstances
5231540	5233540	in there
5233540	5235540	the problem they have
5235540	5237540	is that they don't have much capacity
5237540	5239540	so there are 300 families in one
5239540	5241540	and 110 families in the other
5241540	5243540	but they live
5243540	5245540	it's actually quite heartwarming to see
5245540	5247540	of course the problem is
5247540	5249540	that none of these people
5249540	5251540	have any kind of
5251540	5253540	guarantee
5253540	5255540	of safety
5255540	5257540	I was talking to activists in the good camps
5257540	5259540	who
5259540	5261540	educate them
5261540	5263540	teach them English
5263540	5265540	their own language because they have kids
5265540	5267540	who speak Farsi
5267540	5269540	Persian
5269540	5271540	and they teach them computing
5271540	5273540	and they put a lot of effort in it
5273540	5275540	and it's really heartwarming
5275540	5277540	but they say to me
5277540	5279540	do you know the tragedy
5279540	5281540	of not knowing what's going to happen
5281540	5283540	tomorrow morning because the police may come in
5283540	5285540	grab one of them
5285540	5287540	put them in chains throw them on the boat
5287540	5289540	back to Turkey
5289540	5291540	so you have no idea is this kid
5291540	5293540	you have a 12 year old kid there
5293540	5295540	and his or her parents
5295540	5297540	are they going to be with us for a week
5297540	5299540	2 weeks
5299540	5301540	6 months 2 years
5301540	5303540	the refugees don't know
5303540	5305540	their lives
5305540	5307540	the activists don't know
5307540	5309540	so what do you teach them
5309540	5311540	you teach very differently if you teach somebody for 2 weeks
5311540	5313540	compared to if you know you would be teaching them for 2 years
5313540	5315540	the curriculum is different
5315540	5317540	and the local community
5317540	5319540	doesn't even know
5319540	5321540	is this camp here going to be permanent
5321540	5323540	are we going to assimilate them
5323540	5325540	are we going to live with these people forever
5325540	5327540	because the local community will react differently
5327540	5329540	if they knew that
5329540	5331540	and with some support from them
5331540	5333540	and the worst part is
5333540	5335540	that
5335540	5337540	you know
5337540	5339540	the reason why I left the ministry
5339540	5341540	was because my party
5341540	5343540	and my prime minister capitulated
5343540	5345540	to the
5345540	5347540	loan agreement
5347540	5349540	but immediately after that capitulation
5349540	5351540	that's what usually happens
5351540	5353540	if you capitulate on one big thing
5353540	5355540	then you capitulate on everything
5355540	5357540	after that he also capitulated and signed
5357540	5359540	the European Union Treaty with Turkey
5359540	5361540	and a front
5361540	5363540	to civilization
5363540	5365540	because what we are doing is we are effectively
5365540	5367540	the west
5367540	5369540	civilized Europe
5369540	5371540	we are bribing an increasingly
5371540	5373540	dictatorial president of Turkey
5373540	5375540	to the tune of some like 7 billion
5375540	5377540	dollars
5377540	5379540	so that he allows us
5379540	5381540	to violate international law on refugees
5381540	5383540	you know according to international law of refugees
5383540	5385540	refugees
5385540	5387540	people coming to your country have the right
5387540	5389540	by international law
5389540	5391540	to a hearing
5391540	5393540	that will determine whether they are political refugees
5393540	5395540	or not
5395540	5397540	they don't have that right on lesbos
5397540	5399540	because
5399540	5401540	the EU-Turkey treaty has deemed
5401540	5403540	that Turkey is a safe country
5403540	5405540	so that
5405540	5407540	when you arrive on lesbos
5407540	5409540	you are not granted an interview
5409540	5411540	as to whether you've been persecuted by the Syrian regime
5411540	5413540	by the Taliban
5413540	5415540	by I don't know whom
5415540	5417540	but if you are kept there
5417540	5419540	for an indefinite period
5419540	5421540	you are not allowed to go to the rest of Greece
5421540	5423540	you can wander around like a lost soul in lesbos
5423540	5425540	but of course you live in the camp
5425540	5427540	because there is nowhere else to live
5427540	5429540	where are you going to live on the beach
5429540	5431540	so it's
5431540	5433540	purely horrible but
5433540	5435540	let's just
5435540	5437540	take a broader look at that situation
5437540	5439540	you said the immigration problem
5439540	5441540	I don't see that why
5441540	5443540	that immigration is a problem
5443540	5445540	but it's a great asset
5445540	5447540	from a European perspective
5447540	5449540	for a thousand years
5449540	5451540	we have been populating the earth
5451540	5453540	we're Europeans
5453540	5455540	we've been sending our ships
5455540	5457540	and our caravans
5457540	5459540	to the Americas
5459540	5461540	to Australia, to New Zealand
5461540	5463540	we destroyed all the indigenous people in the world
5463540	5465540	in Africa we colonized
5465540	5467540	we created the new world
5467540	5469540	that's what we did
5469540	5471540	and we thought it was alright
5471540	5473540	but we're aging
5473540	5475540	we're becoming a sad aged lot
5475540	5477540	yeah
5477540	5479540	and the demographic dynamics
5479540	5481540	are reversing
5481540	5483540	and we need these people
5483540	5485540	we really need these people
5485540	5487540	Germany is being depleted
5487540	5489540	it's becoming another Japan
5489540	5491540	Greece too, we have an economic crisis as well
5491540	5493540	you know
5493540	5495540	we are in a process of desertification
5495540	5497540	so we need these people
5497540	5499540	instead of
5499540	5501540	treating migration
5501540	5503540	immigration as an asset
5503540	5505540	that we must collectively
5505540	5507540	manage
5507540	5509540	and find ways
5509540	5511540	of making it work for us Europeans
5511540	5513540	we are looking at it as a threat
5513540	5515540	and we are trying to imagine
5515540	5517540	a huge wall
5517540	5519540	Trump-like
5519540	5521540	going through the Mediterranean
5521540	5523540	the North Pole, I don't know what they are going to do
5523540	5525540	it's pathetic
5525540	5527540	it's just a complete failure of the imagination
5527540	5529540	and the result of course is
5529540	5531540	that the builder
5531540	5533540	the taller
5533540	5535540	and more
5535540	5537540	impenderable the wall that we create
5537540	5539540	the only thing that changes
5539540	5541540	is more deaths
5541540	5543540	and greater profits for the traffickers
5543540	5545540	it doesn't stop immigration
5545540	5547540	all it does it creates insecurity
5547540	5549540	both in the local population
5549540	5551540	and in the migrant population
5551540	5553540	and profits for the traffickers
5553540	5555540	so
5555540	5557540	let them in
5559540	5561540	and impose minimum wages
5561540	5563540	living wages
5563540	5565540	in the countries of their origin
5565540	5567540	and if the countries cannot provide them
5567540	5569540	help them provide them
5569540	5571540	that's the solution
5571540	5573540	not walls
5573540	5575540	I can't help but notice
5575540	5577540	that we are talking about the continuum of capitalism
5577540	5579540	while we overlook a graveyard
5581540	5583540	my understanding
5583540	5585540	but one might be wrong
5585540	5587540	is that we are paying approximately
5587540	5589540	8 trillion dollars for the wars
5589540	5591540	in interest
5591540	5593540	for the wars?
5593540	5595540	for the wars US
5595540	5597540	how does an economy
5597540	5599540	overcome that
5599540	5601540	and how does that play out
5601540	5603540	8 trillion in interest
5603540	5605540	per year
5605540	5607540	it's not 8 trillion per year
5607540	5609540	it's not
5609540	5611540	no
5611540	5613540	but what is your general concern
5613540	5615540	that we pay too much for what
5615540	5617540	for the dead
5617540	5619540	no, I'm talking about the wars, just the wars
5619540	5621540	let me tell you
5621540	5623540	maybe it's 8 billion but not 8 trillion
5623540	5625540	ok, then my figures are wrong
5625540	5627540	3 misers is ok
5633540	5635540	the United States of America
5635540	5637540	as Eisenhower told you in the 1950s
5637540	5639540	and warned you
5639540	5641540	but a very interesting industrial policy
5643540	5645540	you don't have a formal industrial policy
5645540	5647540	you have something called the military industrial complex
5647540	5649540	and the military industrial complex
5649540	5651540	is essential for American capitalism
5651540	5653540	in the way that the American capitalism
5653540	5655540	has been created
5655540	5657540	so
5657540	5659540	the reason why
5659540	5661540	Missouri
5661540	5663540	and Massachusetts can be in the same union
5663540	5665540	and you don't have the same problems that we have
5665540	5667540	between Greece and Germany
5667540	5669540	it's because you have
5669540	5671540	what I call a surplus recycling mechanism
5671540	5673540	you have food stamps
5673540	5675540	you have social security
5675540	5677540	and that means that money
5677540	5679540	that is taxed in the surplus
5679540	5681540	states is transferred
5681540	5683540	to the deficit states and that keeps
5683540	5685540	a degree of balance
5685540	5687540	but the most important part of your surplus
5687540	5689540	recycling mechanism
5689540	5691540	is in the military industrial complex
5691540	5693540	so when Boeing gets a contract
5693540	5695540	to build the new generation of fighter jets
5695540	5697540	quadrillions
5699540	5701540	the Pentagon says to them
5701540	5703540	but you're going to have to build the engine
5703540	5705540	in a new site in Missouri
5705540	5707540	in the deficit places
5707540	5709540	the spare parts of this and that
5709540	5711540	over there and so on
5711540	5713540	so
5713540	5715540	to keep this going you need some wars
5717540	5719540	I'm not proposing that this is how it should be
5719540	5721540	I'm just describing it
5721540	5723540	so in 1991
5723540	5725540	the Pentagon
5725540	5727540	and the Treasury Department
5727540	5729540	had a major
5729540	5731540	major headache
5731540	5733540	the Cold War had finished
5733540	5735540	so they could no longer pass through Congress
5735540	5737540	on the basis of national security
5737540	5739540	the bills that were necessary
5739540	5741540	in order to keep replenishing
5741540	5743540	the cruise and pressing missiles
5743540	5745540	so they had to clear the stock
5745540	5747540	so you had the first war in Iraq
5747540	5749540	and remember
5749540	5751540	the war had finished
5751540	5753540	they were going into the middle of the desert
5753540	5755540	finding all the cruise and pressing missiles
5755540	5757540	to get rid of them
5757540	5759540	so that they could order new ones
5759540	5761540	so capitalism is just
5761540	5763540	a very rational system
5763540	5765540	because
5765540	5767540	it's a very simple reason why it's so irrational
5767540	5769540	because it has a productive capacity
5769540	5771540	a capacity to produce
5771540	5773540	which far exceeds
5773540	5775540	its capacity to consume
5775540	5777540	so something has to make up this difference
5777540	5779540	and war is a result
5779540	5781540	not just lack of democracy
5781540	5783540	Hi, thank you for tonight
5783540	5785540	question for you
5785540	5787540	if we
5787540	5789540	theoretically go back to 2015
5789540	5791540	you're now in charge instead of
5791540	5793540	Cyprus, in charge of Greece
5793540	5795540	faced with harsh austerity versus Grexit
5795540	5797540	what political path would you have chosen?
5797540	5799540	You know the answer
5799540	5801540	that's why I'm here, I'm not in the ministry
5803540	5805540	why am I not in the ministry
5805540	5807540	why did I resign
5807540	5809540	we had an agreement
5809540	5811540	we had a very simple agreement
5811540	5813540	and this is the only reason why I accepted the finance ministry
5813540	5815540	and to run in the election
5815540	5817540	we had an agreement that there were three possible outcomes
5817540	5819540	I'll put it succinctly
5819540	5821540	three possible outcomes
5821540	5823540	one was
5823540	5825540	continuing debt bondage
5825540	5827540	in the euro
5827540	5829540	which is what has been happening since 2010
5829540	5831540	for me that was the worst possible outcome
5831540	5833540	another outcome was Grexit
5833540	5835540	for Greece to be chucked out of the eurozone
5835540	5837540	or to choose to get out
5837540	5839540	this came
5839540	5841540	with substantial costs
5841540	5843540	and it was never my proposal
5843540	5845540	but I always considered it to be better
5845540	5847540	than perpetual debt bondage in the euro
5847540	5849540	when people say but the euro is a strong currency
5849540	5851540	I say if you're a pauper
5851540	5853540	and you live under a bridge in New York
5853540	5855540	you have one dollar in your pocket
5855540	5857540	it doesn't mean you have a strong currency
5857540	5859540	you have one bloody dollar in your pocket
5859540	5861540	it doesn't help much
5861540	5863540	and then
5863540	5865540	the first best
5865540	5867540	my
5867540	5869540	ideal solution
5869540	5871540	would be
5871540	5873540	debt restructuring within the euro
5873540	5875540	that would allow us to stay in the euro in a sustainable way
5875540	5877540	and to end the great depression
5877540	5879540	so the point I was making was
5879540	5881540	no bluffing
5881540	5883540	we say to them we don't want to get out of the euro
5883540	5885540	but we need a debt restructure
5885540	5887540	and we need the end of austerity
5887540	5889540	for Greece to remain
5889540	5891540	sustainable within the euro
5891540	5893540	and let's sit down and we'll compromise
5893540	5895540	I did say to Obama
5895540	5897540	when he said you have to compromise
5897540	5899540	I compromised
5899540	5901540	I dream of compromise
5901540	5903540	but I'm never going to be
5903540	5905540	compromised
5905540	5907540	there is a fundamental difference between the two
5907540	5909540	ok
5909540	5911540	and we say to them
5911540	5913540	we are not going to accept that
5913540	5915540	we are not putting our signature on another loan agreement
5915540	5917540	that extends and pretends
5917540	5919540	our bankruptcy into the future
5919540	5921540	shoot us, kill us, get us out of the euro
5921540	5923540	we don't want to get out of the euro
5923540	5925540	but we consider getting out of the euro to be
5925540	5927540	a lesser evil
5927540	5929540	than staying under the conditions of debt
5929540	5931540	so Cyprus supposedly agreed with me
5931540	5933540	and not only agreed with me but considered to be more
5933540	5935540	right-wing than him
5935540	5937540	and more ready to compromise
5937540	5939540	and he had some reasons
5939540	5941540	not that he was right
5941540	5943540	but
5943540	5945540	you'll be very
5945540	5947540	interested to hear that
5947540	5949540	but one of the people that worked with me
5949540	5951540	during this period in creating
5951540	5953540	the plan and the narrative against
5953540	5955540	the Troika and the International Monetary Fund
5955540	5957540	was somebody called Larry Summers
5957540	5959540	who was actually very good
5959540	5961540	because he understood that what was happening in Greece
5961540	5963540	reflected
5963540	5965540	very quickly and immediately in the European
5965540	5967540	macroeconomic stance
5967540	5969540	which was detrimental to the interests of the United States
5969540	5971540	so we worked together
5971540	5973540	with Larry Summers
5973540	5975540	and when we met I said
5975540	5977540	I'm very glad you haven't read my last book
5977540	5979540	and he said
5979540	5981540	why? I said because
5981540	5983540	I referred to it to you
5983540	5985540	on a number of occasions in the same book
5985540	5987540	as the prince of darkness
5987540	5989540	and he said
5989540	5991540	well at least you called me prince
5991540	5993540	I've been called worse
5993540	5995540	so it's clear
5995540	5997540	the two organizations
5997540	5999540	I like to follow side by side
5999540	6001540	the DM25 movement
6001540	6003540	and six degrees of citizen space
6003540	6005540	in Canada
6005540	6007540	with John Rouse and Saul
6007540	6009540	and I just really enjoyed John Rouse and Saul's book
6009540	6011540	The Collapse of Globalism
6011540	6013540	and he describes this idea
6013540	6015540	of a positive form of nationalism
6015540	6017540	that we haven't explored
6017540	6019540	we think of nationalism as negative
6019540	6021540	and we often only see negative forms
6021540	6023540	based on exclusion
6023540	6025540	but our movements like
6025540	6027540	DM25
6027540	6029540	imagining
6029540	6031540	and exploring possibly
6031540	6033540	hijacking and displacing hate
6033540	6035540	with positive forms of nationalism
6035540	6037540	that are centered around
6037540	6039540	inclusion
6039540	6041540	and
6041540	6043540	sort of collective missions
6043540	6045540	like reducing inequality
6045540	6047540	that can capture a lot of the people
6047540	6049540	that are displaced in this country
6049540	6051540	the Trump voters that might not be racist
6051540	6053540	that just wanted a better deal
6053540	6055540	and they really fall in with the flag
6055540	6057540	when someone waves the flag
6057540	6059540	they're easy to be manipulated
6059540	6061540	but they just feel that they must go with it
6061540	6063540	but now in this country
6063540	6065540	when you see two American flags
6065540	6067540	on the back of a pickup truck
6067540	6069540	that's kind of a hate symbol
6069540	6071540	the left progressive people
6071540	6073540	that enjoy inclusion
6073540	6075540	have maybe allowed
6075540	6077540	the flag to get stolen from them
6077540	6079540	but then at the same time
6079540	6081540	we need to integrate nationalism
6081540	6083540	possibly a new form
6083540	6085540	with ideas like a federation
6085540	6087540	to gain more power
6087540	6089540	back into
6089540	6091540	the political sphere
6091540	6093540	against the financial sphere
6093540	6095540	Well, let me say that
6095540	6097540	I get your drift
6099540	6101540	I grew up in a culture
6101540	6103540	where the left
6105540	6107540	answered this question of yours
6107540	6109540	a long time ago
6109540	6111540	by making a distinction
6111540	6113540	not between positive and negative
6113540	6115540	but between patriotism
6115540	6117540	a line was always
6117540	6119540	we're patriots
6119540	6121540	and the difference between a patriot and a nationalist
6121540	6123540	the patriot loves his country
6123540	6125540	and the nationalist thinks that his country
6125540	6127540	has the right to steamroll over every other country
6127540	6129540	and I think that is a good way
6129540	6131540	of resolving it
6131540	6133540	and also by making this more
6133540	6135540	contemporary
6135540	6137540	I think we have to
6137540	6139540	appropriate the
6139540	6141540	slogan
6141540	6143540	we should take this
6143540	6145540	I want my city back
6145540	6147540	I want my neighborhood back
6147540	6149540	I want control over my city
6149540	6151540	my municipality
6151540	6153540	my state, my country
6153540	6155540	but the only way to get my country back
6155540	6157540	is if others get their country back
6157540	6159540	as well
6159540	6161540	and if we all work together
6161540	6163540	and we understand that to get our country back
6163540	6165540	we need to resolve problems such as
6165540	6167540	low quality jobs
6167540	6169540	low levels of investments
6169540	6171540	in the green transition
6171540	6173540	that the planet needs
6173540	6175540	climate change and so on
6175540	6177540	that we need to fight poverty
6177540	6179540	and it is impossible to fight poverty in one country
6179540	6181540	when it's rising in other countries
6181540	6183540	if you think that you can do that
6183540	6185540	you're deluding yourself
6185540	6187540	so in effect
6187540	6189540	to embed patriotism
6189540	6191540	in a narrative which sees
6191540	6193540	the major problems that society faces
6193540	6195540	like poverty, low investment
6195540	6197540	problems with the health service and so on
6197540	6199540	as we see climate change
6201540	6203540	what I mean by that
6203540	6205540	is climate change requires local action
6205540	6207540	that we do things here
6207540	6209540	in Boston, that we do things in Massachusetts
6209540	6211540	in the United States but we have to act globally
6211540	6213540	as well
6213540	6215540	and we need to cooperate
6215540	6217540	because resolving poverty as I said
6217540	6219540	can only happen at
6219540	6221540	the Bretton Woods system is a good example
6221540	6223540	poverty fell everywhere
6223540	6225540	throughout the global system
6225540	6227540	inequality shrunk everywhere
6227540	6229540	it couldn't rise in one place massively
6229540	6231540	and fall in another
6231540	6233540	so we have to combine
6233540	6235540	level of country, of neighborhoods
6235540	6237540	of community, patriotism
6237540	6239540	with transnationalism and internationalism
6239540	6241540	that allows us to claim
6241540	6243540	our own countries back
6243540	6245540	a funny multinational question
6245540	6247540	that I would love to hear answered from you
6247540	6249540	in the book
6249540	6251540	John Rouse and Saul describes this concept
6251540	6253540	where a lot of the trade
6253540	6255540	we have is fictitious
6255540	6257540	it is multinationals trading with themselves
6257540	6259540	yeah of course
6259540	6261540	and
6261540	6263540	it's called limit pricing
6263540	6265540	well now you know we were just
6265540	6267540	creating these tariffs
6267540	6269540	that might not really get to the root
6269540	6271540	of the issue we were punishing multinationals
6271540	6273540	we weren't punishing another nation
6273540	6275540	we were punishing multinationals
6275540	6277540	that straddle to nations
6277540	6279540	and that not a lot of people in this country
6279540	6281540	know how to think of these concepts
6281540	6283540	well I have a better way
6283540	6285540	of punishing the multinationals
6285540	6287540	how about making the IRS do its job
6287540	6289540	because if you
6289540	6291540	go to
6291540	6293540	Venezuela, or by the example
6293540	6295540	if you go to Italy and make some money
6295540	6297540	you get taxed here
6297540	6299540	you are taxed by the IRS
6299540	6301540	on your global income
6301540	6303540	you cannot say
6303540	6305540	I made $10,000 in
6305540	6307540	Napoli and therefore
6307540	6309540	none of your business
6309540	6311540	you get taxed on your global income
6311540	6313540	unless you are a corporation
6313540	6315540	and then you don't get taxed at all
6315540	6317540	for the money you stash away
6317540	6319540	all over the world
6319540	6321540	how about having the IRS do its job
6321540	6323540	instead of introducing
6323540	6325540	tariffs that in the end
6325540	6327540	have a detrimental effect on all of us
6327540	6329540	but the IRS can't
6329540	6331540	yes it can
6331540	6333540	yes of course it can
6333540	6335540	they need their marching orders
6335540	6337540	from congress
6337540	6339540	they need the politicians to say to them
6339540	6341540	you are going to treat
6341540	6343540	look, the supreme court
6343540	6345540	in its infinite idiocy
6345540	6347540	decided that corporations and human
6347540	6349540	beings and individuals will be treated the same
6349540	6351540	when it comes to super PACs and all that
6351540	6353540	why not treat
6353540	6355540	also decide that
6355540	6357540	corporations and individuals will be treated the same
6357540	6359540	tax wise
6359540	6361540	I remember a beautiful
6361540	6363540	poster I saw in Texas saying that
6363540	6365540	I like it
6365540	6367540	I believe that corporations
6367540	6369540	have human rights
6369540	6371540	when I see one of them being hanged
6373540	6375540	that was Texas for you
6375540	6377540	in the
6377540	6379540	briefest and broadest of strokes
6379540	6381540	in the post-capitalistic world
6381540	6383540	that you envision
6383540	6385540	what does the credit system look like
6385540	6387540	and how does it achieve equilibrium
6387540	6389540	with the sovereignty of states
6389540	6391540	ok how long do we have
6391540	6393540	no but
6393540	6395540	let me put it simply
6397540	6399540	if we have a system
6399540	6401540	where private
6401540	6403540	property
6403540	6405540	is maintained over
6405540	6407540	goods and services
6407540	6409540	and things that give you happiness
6409540	6411540	but not over
6411540	6413540	productive processes
6413540	6415540	and productive processes belong
6415540	6417540	to those that work them
6417540	6419540	that are part of it
6419540	6421540	then you simply
6421540	6423540	have a credit system
6423540	6425540	you don't need one at all
6429540	6431540	your justification for that is
6431540	6433540	that credit is only necessary
6433540	6435540	when you've got an asymmetrical distribution
6435540	6437540	of property rights
6437540	6439540	over means of production
6439540	6441540	if you and I have a cooperative
6441540	6443540	if we own a business together
6443540	6445540	we have a partnership
6445540	6447540	then I'm never going to be in your debt
6447540	6449540	or you admire that
6449540	6451540	we're producing together
6451540	6453540	and we're going to be sharing the profits
6453540	6455540	that we make
6455540	6457540	what about investors
6457540	6459540	well there would be no investors
6459540	6461540	what about the other person
6461540	6463540	because investors exist only because
6463540	6465540	you have an asymmetrical distribution
6465540	6467540	of wealth
6467540	6469540	if you didn't have asymmetrical distribution
6469540	6471540	but look this is going to be the topic of my next book
6471540	6473540	I have not written it yet
6473540	6475540	so I'll see you in 3 years
6479540	6481540	ευχαριστώ
