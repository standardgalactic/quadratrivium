1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,180
Θα μπορούσα να δούμε τον Γερματικό Φινένσμι,

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:09,380
ότι είχε εξαναγωγήσει με δυνατές που έφεραν σαν λασσοπίδια.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,260
Και έφεραν το παιδί και είχε πει,

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,440
«Αυτή η σημερινή, η σημερινή,

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,240
η οποία θα εξαναγωγήσω εσύ».

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,540
Οι εξαναγωγήσεις δεν μπορούν να αλλάξουν την οικονομική πολιτισμία.

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:28,540
Οι εξαναγωγήσεις δεν μπορούσαν να εξαναγωγήσουν την οικονομική πολιτισμία.

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,540
Έχω εξαναγωγήσει.

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,540
Η εξαναγωγήση μου ήταν,

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,540
«Αυτή η εξαναγωγήση για την κίνηση της Κίνησης,

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,540
γιατί they believed that too».

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,540
Και έγιναν με την προποσία,

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,540
αυτό είναι το reason why they hated me,

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,540
was to be very moderate and said,

15
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,540
«In that case, Wolfgang, let's ban elections,

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,540
in bankrupt countries.

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,540
Let's come out and declare that in the European Union

18
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,540
you can only have democracy if you are a creditor country.

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,540
If you are a debtor country, no democracy,

20
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,540
elections cannot be allowed to change anything,

21
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,540
because we have a loan agreement.

22
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,540
We have a debtor's prison.

23
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,540
Let's put Greece in the workhouse.

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,540
I didn't say all these things,

25
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,540
but I did say the thing about the Chinese Communist Party.

26
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,540
«Αν εξαναγωγήσει την κίνηση της Κίνησης,

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,540
γιατί they believed that if you are not able

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,540
to explain the economy in a language

29
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,540
which young people can understand,

30
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,540
then you are clueless yourself.

31
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,540
This from its author, Yanos Varifakis,

32
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,540
a man not only known not to mince his words,

33
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,540
but one who, in fact, wrote the book in Greek in nine days.

34
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,540
I'm Mary Stath, the director of Cambridge Forum

35
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,540
and tonight to assist us in navigating

36
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,540
the murky waters of capitalism,

37
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,540
and to quote Yanos,

38
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,540
«Come to terms with the beast that dominates our lives.

39
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,540
We are privileged to have the best of teachers,

40
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,540
a philosopher and international economist,

41
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,540
Varis Varifakis.»

42
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,540
I'm very much looking forward to the conversation

43
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,540
that we're going to have.

44
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,540
But I've been asked to give a presentation,

45
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,540
so I will, because sometimes I like to do,

46
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,540
as I'm told, not very often.

47
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,540
The title that has been advertised

48
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,540
and some of you saw it outside and walked in,

49
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,540
so I might as well honour the title,

50
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,540
is a question.

51
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,540
Is Capitalism Devouring Democracy?

52
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,540
Allow me to begin with a slightly different question.

53
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,540
Have you noticed how in the last few decades

54
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,540
the quality of politicians has stumbled?

55
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,540
Not just in this country, everywhere.

56
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,540
For God's sake, even I became a politician in 2015.

57
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,540
No, but seriously,

58
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,540
there is a marked diminution

59
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,540
in the rhetoric, in the capacity of politicians

60
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,540
to inspire and indeed in the power that they have.

61
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,540
Now, I don't believe that this is due to

62
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,540
a degeneration of the DNA of humanity

63
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,540
or of those who are interested in politics.

64
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,540
What we have been observing

65
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,540
is the shrinking of what I shall refer to

66
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,540
as the political sphere.

67
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,540
There used to be a time before capitalism

68
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,540
when there was one sphere, the sphere of power.

69
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,540
It was impossible to separate economic power

70
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,540
from political power.

71
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,540
The king had both military power,

72
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,540
military power, produced political power

73
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,540
and political power and economic power

74
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,540
were one and the same thing.

75
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,540
There is no great mystery really

76
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,540
as to why there was no economics 150 years ago.

77
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,540
The thing about Harvard University

78
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,540
did not have an economics department

79
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,540
in the 19th century, why?

80
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,540
Because there was no need for it

81
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,540
before capitalism came of age.

82
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,540
Before capitalism, the political and economic sphere

83
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,540
were one.

84
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,540
There were closures in Britain

85
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,540
that you had a remarkable transformation of society,

86
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,540
that great transformation.

87
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,540
The shifting from feudalism to capitalism.

88
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,540
Effectively, the peasants were evicted from the land,

89
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,540
replaced by sheep,

90
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,540
because of the international trade routes

91
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,540
that were creating an international market for wool

92
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,540
and some commodities like wool, like steel,

93
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,540
like spices and so on

94
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,540
were emerging as international commodities

95
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,540
with prices that were determined

96
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,540
at the level of the international trade route system.

97
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,540
All the other commodities were goods,

98
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,540
were effectively sidelined.

99
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,540
The lord of the land in Yorkshire

100
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,540
or in Manchester had absolutely no incentive

101
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,540
to retain those peasants

102
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,540
planting idiotic little vegetables

103
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,540
when they could just chuck them out of the land,

104
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,540
replace them with fat sheep,

105
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,540
whose wool suddenly had an international value,

106
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,540
exchange value.

107
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,540
But the enclosures created the working class.

108
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,540
It created the commodification of labour.

109
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,540
Up until then, people worked very hard,

110
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,540
but they didn't sell their labour.

111
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,540
We had a very interesting reversal

112
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:32,540
of the timing of economic production and distribution.

113
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,540
Under feudalism, we had work, production first.

114
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,540
People actually toiled, they worked the land

115
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,540
and they produced the harvest.

116
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,540
Production came first.

117
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,540
Then came distribution.

118
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,540
The lord of the land or the miner or whatever

119
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,540
would send the sheriff in

120
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,540
and take his cut from the harvest.

121
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,540
How much he would take

122
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,540
and how much he would leave behind

123
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,540
was a political issue.

124
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,540
It had to do with military power.

125
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,540
It had to do even with the benevolence of the lord.

126
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,540
It had to do with the extent to which

127
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,540
the lord needed to keep the peasants on side

128
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,540
in case another lord tried to usurp

129
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
his property rights over the land.

130
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,540
It was a political, diplomatic, ethical,

131
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,540
religious, economic process

132
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,540
that determined distribution after production.

133
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,540
Finally, the surplus that the lord amassed

134
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,540
was sold in nearby markets

135
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,540
and that created a financial surplus

136
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,540
for the lord which then he lent out.

137
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,540
We had production, distribution

138
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,540
and then finally finance.

139
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,540
But with the enclosures

140
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,540
and the eviction of the peasantry

141
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,540
we had the exact opposite

142
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,540
because suddenly the lord,

143
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,540
the last thing that the lord wanted to do

144
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,540
is to work or to be entrepreneurial.

145
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,540
So the replacement of the peasants with a sheep

146
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,540
meant that suddenly every acre of land

147
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,540
had an economic value, an exchange value, a price

148
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,540
that did not exist, that was not the case before.

149
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,540
Why did it acquire this price?

150
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,540
Because you knew how many sheep

151
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,540
you could raise on an acre.

152
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,540
You know how much more or less

153
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,540
wool you would produce.

154
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,540
International markets were providing

155
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,540
the equilibrium price of the wool

156
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,540
so you knew how much exchange value

157
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,540
money you could gather per acre of your land.

158
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,540
And of course then once that price was established

159
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,540
that exchange value per acre was established

160
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,540
suddenly land became a commodity

161
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,540
to be rented out, to be sold, to be purchased.

162
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,540
There was no real estate market before that.

163
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,540
Land was either you inherited land

164
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,540
in which case you had it

165
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,540
and if you never inherited land you never got it.

166
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,540
And the only way of effectively getting land

167
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,540
that you didn't have was through war, through conquest.

168
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,540
Or if the king decided to grant you

169
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,540
a plot of land.

170
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,540
There was no such thing as a market for land

171
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,540
and there was no such thing as a market of labor.

172
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,540
The enclosures, the eviction of the peasants

173
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,540
created land as a commodity

174
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,540
and of course labor as a commodity

175
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,540
because the evicted peasants

176
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,540
effectively they were roaming around the country

177
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,540
knocking on doors saying

178
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,540
I will do anything for work, for work,

179
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,540
for a piece of bread.

180
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,540
That's the first labor market.

181
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,540
That had never happened before

182
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,540
in the history of humanity.

183
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:38,540
People with nothing selling their labor time.

184
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,540
That's the beginning of capitalism.

185
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,540
But with this you have the separation

186
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,540
of the economic from the political sphere

187
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,540
for the first time in our history as a species.

188
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,540
Because suddenly you had merchants

189
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,540
who acquired huge power

190
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:01,540
through the accumulation of financial surpluses

191
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,540
because the internationalization

192
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,540
of those trade routes,

193
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,540
the emergence of these few commodities

194
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,540
as international commodities

195
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,540
that bestowed substantial financial surplus

196
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,540
upon those who handled them

197
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,540
whether they were the merchants,

198
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,540
the ship owners or the lords of the land

199
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,540
whose land now was used

200
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,540
in order to cultivate inverted commerce wool.

201
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,540
For the first time you had this separation.

202
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:35,540
You had lords whose political power

203
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,540
and social power

204
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,540
were now becoming increasingly

205
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,540
disproportionate to their economic power.

206
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,540
You had those dirty merchants

207
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,540
as they consider them.

208
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,540
The riffraff, the ugly dirty merchants

209
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,540
acquiring huge quantities of economic power

210
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,540
that had nothing to do with their social status.

211
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,540
They were not allowed in the palace.

212
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,540
They were not allowed in parliament.

213
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:04,540
They were not allowed in the gentlemen's clubs in London.

214
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,540
Suddenly they had a lot more economic power than the lords.

215
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,540
The economic and the political sphere separated.

216
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,540
With industrialization you throw into this mix

217
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,540
James Watts great invention, the steam engine

218
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,540
and this process just goes berserk.

219
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,540
You have globalization

220
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,540
which Karl Marx and Fritzrich Engels

221
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,540
in the manifesto described

222
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,540
in the most poetic language

223
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,540
when they say that capital must nestle everywhere,

224
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,540
it must settle everywhere,

225
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,540
it must enter into relations everywhere.

226
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,540
It was interesting because when Marx and Engels were writing that

227
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,540
it hadn't happened yet.

228
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,540
But they foresaw the process that we live in.

229
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,540
Globalization.

230
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,540
With globalization now we have, well,

231
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,540
with this process of globalization

232
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,540
you have the establishment of these

233
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,540
completely separate two spheres.

234
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,540
Now interestingly in the 19th century

235
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,540
you recall this.

236
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,540
Well, you live in a very historic town.

237
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:13,540
Liberalism was a philosophy, a political philosophy

238
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,540
at odds with democracy.

239
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,540
To be a liberal, a genuine liberal

240
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,540
you must have been very skeptical about democracy

241
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,540
if not completely and utterly anti-democratic.

242
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,540
The whole point about liberalism

243
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,540
was how to preserve the right

244
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,540
to track barter and exchange

245
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,540
in Adam Smith's famous expression

246
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,540
which was a right that many of the liberals

247
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,540
including John Stuart Mill,

248
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,540
a very liberal person,

249
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,540
a very progressive person for his age,

250
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,540
he considered the idea of democracy

251
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,540
what is democracy,

252
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,540
is the rule of the many

253
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,540
to be a great impediment

254
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,540
if not a great threat to liberalism.

255
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,540
So when we talk about liberal democracy today

256
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,540
we're talking about something

257
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,540
that in the 19th century

258
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,540
was a contradiction in terms

259
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,540
to be a liberal meant

260
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,540
that you did not believe in democracy.

261
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,540
Now what was it that brought about

262
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,540
a change, a transformation?

263
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,540
Suddenly liberals started

264
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,540
embracing the idea of democracy.

265
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,540
It was economic crisis,

266
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,540
financial and economic crisis

267
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,540
beginning especially in this country

268
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,540
in Europe in the 1840s

269
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,540
because the moment capitalism

270
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,540
started turbocharging itself

271
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,540
with the creation of what I will describe

272
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,540
as networked companies

273
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,540
with the advances in electromagnetism,

274
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,540
electric engines, the telegraph,

275
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,540
all the communication technologies,

276
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,540
electricity grids.

277
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,540
When electricity comes into production

278
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,540
and we move beyond steam

279
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,540
that's the second industrial revolution

280
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,540
to create, when Edison created his empire

281
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,540
he created a networked company.

282
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,540
Remember from the electric bulb

283
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,540
to the power generating station,

284
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,540
to the grid, everything was part of this.

285
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,540
We talk about Google now and Apple

286
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,540
as being mega companies,

287
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,540
well the mega company was invented

288
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,540
with the second industrial revolution.

289
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,540
But think about it,

290
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,540
to set up a company like Edison's

291
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,540
or later Henry Ford's and so on

292
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,540
you needed a lot of financing,

293
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,540
you needed a lot of money.

294
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,540
So suddenly the new reversed order

295
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,540
becomes very significant

296
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,540
because now ever since the peasants

297
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,540
were thrown out of the land,

298
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,540
ever since the enclosures in Britain

299
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,540
the Lord rented out,

300
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,540
leased out an acre or a few acres

301
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,540
to an ex peasant and said

302
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,540
okay, I will charge you a rent,

303
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,540
you raise the sheep here

304
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,540
and you keep the difference,

305
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,540
the residual payments.

306
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,540
So once you pay for the land,

307
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,540
me, once you pay the workers,

308
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,540
the ones that have been expelled

309
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,540
and now are working for a piece of bread,

310
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,540
subsistence wages,

311
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,540
once you pay for the sheep,

312
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,540
for the shearing, scissors,

313
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,540
whatever it is that you are using,

314
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,540
your capital equipment,

315
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,540
what you keep in the end is your profit.

316
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,540
So suddenly these proto-entrepreneurs

317
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,540
were forced, they didn't choose to do it,

318
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,540
they were forced to become entrepreneurs,

319
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,540
but how do you become an entrepreneur?

320
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,540
First you borrow,

321
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,540
and usually you borrow it from the landlord.

322
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,540
The landlord lends you the money

323
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,540
to pay him rent,

324
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,540
with interest.

325
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,540
So you see the reversal?

326
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,540
Instead of finance coming at the end,

327
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,540
we used to have production then exchange

328
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,540
or distribution and then finally finance.

329
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,540
Now we have finance first.

330
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,540
At the beginning there was the loan.

331
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,540
Once the loan comes in,

332
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,540
you hire the workers, you pay the rent,

333
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,540
immediately you have distribution.

334
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,540
So you have finance first, distribution second,

335
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,540
the last thing that happens is production.

336
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,540
So finance suddenly acquires

337
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,540
a very special place in capitalism.

338
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,540
Now the beauty and ugliness

339
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,540
of finance, of banking,

340
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,540
is that it is a magical process.

341
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,540
Because once we move from the landlord

342
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,540
to Edison and Henry Ford,

343
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,540
it is impossible to finance capitalism

344
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,540
simply by the accumulated wealth

345
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,540
of some rich person like the Lord.

346
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,540
There was never enough money

347
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,540
in the hands of any financier

348
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,540
to provide Edison with the capital,

349
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
with the money he needed

350
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,540
in order to set up his networked firm.

351
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,540
So you needed banks to conjure up money from nothing.

352
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,540
And this is how finance has been working

353
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,540
ever since the Second Industrial Revolution.

354
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,540
How?

355
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,540
By creating money from thin air.

356
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,540
There is a common fallacy

357
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,540
in the popular culture that we live in,

358
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,540
that banks operate like vaults.

359
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,540
Whereby you and I put our savings in

360
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,540
and somebody else goes to the bank

361
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,540
and borrows money that comes from our savings.

362
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,540
And the banker makes a profit

363
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,540
as a result of the difference

364
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,540
between the interest rate

365
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,540
that he pays us

366
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,540
for depositing our money into his vault

367
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,540
and the interest rate that he charges

368
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,540
the person that has borrowed money

369
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,540
in order to invest in a shop, in a factory, whatever.

370
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,540
That is not what is going on.

371
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,540
If you go to the bank tomorrow morning

372
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,540
and you get a loan from the bank,

373
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,540
the money is going to come out of thin air.

374
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,540
The bank will create it out of nothing.

375
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,540
It's really very simple.

376
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,540
You get $100,000 to buy a house,

377
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,540
to invest in a business.

378
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,540
What will happen is

379
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,540
somebody is going to type $100,000

380
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,540
$100,000 into your bank account.

381
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,540
So it's conjured up.

382
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,540
The ancient Greeks had a word for money,

383
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,540
νόμισμα, or coin,

384
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,540
which comes from the verb νόμισμα,

385
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,540
which means to imagine.

386
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,540
So Aristotle defined the value of money

387
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,540
as a common fiction

388
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,540
since the ancient times.

389
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,540
This is exactly what it is.

390
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,540
So the banker simply types the money in there.

391
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,540
You put your card in the ATM

392
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,540
and suddenly you have $100,000.

393
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,540
Somebody typed $100,000 on the system.

394
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,540
Then what you can do is

395
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,540
you can use web banking, you can wire the money.

396
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,540
If you buy a car or a house,

397
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,540
it goes to the bank account of the vendor.

398
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,540
If you invest in a shop,

399
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,540
it goes to the landlord,

400
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,540
to another bank account with the same banking system.

401
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,540
It doesn't matter whether it's the same bank or not.

402
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,540
So these digits that were typed into your account

403
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,540
simply are transferred to another account.

404
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,540
That's all that happens.

405
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,540
Now, the hope of the banker is

406
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,540
that you are going to use this money productively.

407
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,540
You're going to earn money from that

408
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,540
and then you will give the banker

409
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,540
the money that will effectively tie up

410
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,540
that loose end with interest.

411
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,540
Now, to the extent that this works

412
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,540
and it really works magnificently,

413
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,540
in my book I relate this

414
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,540
in the form of a science fiction metaphor.

415
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,540
It's a bit like a banker

416
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,540
being the specially gifted magician

417
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,540
who has a very long arm

418
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,540
and can push his arm, it's usually he,

419
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,540
so allow me not to say she or he.

420
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,540
Through the timeline,

421
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,540
he pushes his hand into the future,

422
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:02,540
grabs value that has not been created yet,

423
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,540
snatches it from the future,

424
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,540
brings it into the present

425
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,540
and gives it to you.

426
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,540
Hopefully you do productive things

427
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,540
and you create a value that will repay the future.

428
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,540
This is my preferred metaphor

429
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,540
for what bankers do.

430
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,540
But once they learn the beauty

431
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,540
and the glory of doing this

432
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,540
and they are privileged

433
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,540
in a privileged spot

434
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,540
because they can take value from the future,

435
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,540
bring it to the present, they don't do any work themselves.

436
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,540
Because they are the mediators

437
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,540
between future and present value,

438
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,540
they are ultra-rich

439
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,540
and not only ultra-rich,

440
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,540
but central in societal processes,

441
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,540
political processes.

442
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,540
So if you do this and it works,

443
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,540
why not do more of it?

444
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,540
Keep snatching more value from the future

445
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,540
and bringing it to the present.

446
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,540
At some point, the present can no longer produce

447
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,540
the value that it needs to produce

448
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,540
in order to repay the present.

449
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,540
At that point, suddenly,

450
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,540
those of us who have borrowed money

451
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,540
or some of us

452
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,540
have no capacity to repay it,

453
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,540
a recession begins,

454
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,540
people that work for us lose their jobs,

455
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,540
they cannot repay their own loans

456
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,540
and suddenly, the book of the bank

457
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,540
is full of loans that are non-performing.

458
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,540
At that point, if you and I

459
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,540
or those of us who have some money in the bank

460
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,540
realize that this is happening,

461
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,540
we panic, we rush to the bank,

462
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,540
this is a bank run, we ask for the cash,

463
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,540
the cash is not there.

464
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,540
And then you have the financial crisis

465
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,540
that we had in this country

466
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,540
and in Europe from the 1840s onwards.

467
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,540
Now, to a very large extent,

468
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,540
the United States of America,

469
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,540
the way you understand your own country now,

470
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,540
is the product of this political response

471
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,540
to a sequence of financial crisis

472
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,540
beginning from the 1840s.

473
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,540
Even the creation of the Federal Reserve

474
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,540
in the beginning of the 20th century

475
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,540
was the result of J.P. Morgan saying,

476
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,540
I've had enough of bailing out my mates.

477
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,540
Let's create a Federal Reserve

478
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,540
that is going to be doing the job.

479
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,540
And of course, he created it.

480
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,540
It was all stitched up amongst the bankers.

481
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,540
Think of all the great institutions of this country,

482
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,540
like social security, food stamps,

483
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,540
they are the result of 1929.

484
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,540
It's what brought this nation together,

485
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,540
what created the United States of America,

486
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,540
the way you understand it.

487
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,540
It's a sequence of financial collapses

488
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:36,540
that puts together nations

489
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,540
and politics and democratic processes.

490
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:44,540
So, let me go back to the beginning.

491
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,540
We used to have one sphere of power.

492
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:52,540
It was political, economic, cultural, military.

493
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,540
Power had many different facets,

494
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:02,540
but it was one sphere in which it emerged from.

495
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,540
Then it separated into two spheres,

496
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,540
the political sphere and the economic sphere.

497
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,540
And as it did,

498
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,540
the political sphere was increasingly democratized.

499
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,540
Why?

500
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,540
Because all the important decisions

501
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,540
were moving to the economic sphere.

502
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,540
So, political legitimacy

503
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,540
and the capacity of the regime,

504
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,540
of the system that we live in,

505
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,540
to maintain itself and to be sustainable

506
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,540
through the common belief amongst the people

507
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,540
that this is a legitimate system,

508
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,540
was based on democratization of giving people the idea

509
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,540
that they had control over their communities,

510
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,540
the nation, their politics.

511
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,540
But this democratization was only accepted

512
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,540
by the proponents of liberalism

513
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,540
to the extent that all the important decisions

514
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,540
were migrating from the political sphere

515
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,540
as the political sphere was democratized.

516
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,540
Women understand that.

517
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,540
It's like the feminization of certain professions.

518
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,540
When women moved into teaching,

519
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,540
teaching lost its power.

520
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,540
When they moved into health,

521
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,540
increased now the majority of judges are women.

522
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,540
And you should see the judicial system collapsing.

523
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,540
So, it's a very similar process that we see.

524
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,540
Power is migrating from the economic sphere

525
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,540
to the political sphere,

526
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,540
and the political sphere is democratized increasingly.

527
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,540
Now, something fundamental happened

528
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,540
beginning in this country in the 1970s.

529
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,540
After the end of Bretton Woods,

530
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,540
which was what? What was Bretton Woods?

531
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,540
Let's not get complicated.

532
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,540
It was the globalization of the New Deal.

533
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,540
Roosevelt's New Deal in 1933,

534
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,540
what was the basic idea?

535
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,540
To put the financial genie,

536
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,540
the banking genie back into its bottle,

537
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,540
to make banking boring,

538
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,540
effectively to ban bankers from doing things

539
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,540
that allowed too much money to be created

540
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,540
and too many bubbles to be built up,

541
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,540
mobilizing idle savings,

542
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,540
the idle savings of the richer members of society,

543
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,540
and putting those idle savings,

544
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,540
turning them into a force in the public interest,

545
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,540
infrastructural works, public works,

546
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,540
education, social security and so on.

547
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,540
That was the New Deal.

548
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,540
But towards the end of the war,

549
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,540
the New Dealers extended that New Deal

550
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,540
internationally,

551
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,540
as Europe was just a pile of ashes.

552
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,540
Japan, you don't need me to explain

553
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,540
what happened to Japan in 1945.

554
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,540
So Bretton Woods, it was a magnificent system.

555
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:54,540
Think about it, the United States official dome in DC

556
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,540
effectively designed a global capitalist system

557
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,540
that was like a planned economy.

558
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,540
4% interest rates forever,

559
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,540
20 years of 4% interest rates,

560
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,540
no ups and downs, maybe,

561
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,540
plus or minus 0.1%.

562
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,540
So you knew what your mortgage rate

563
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,540
would be in the next 20 years.

564
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,540
You knew if you wanted to change

565
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,540
dollars for British pounds,

566
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,540
you knew how many pounds you would get.

567
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,540
You would get the same quantity year in, year out.

568
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,540
So it was a world which was a nightmare

569
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,540
for finances and of course,

570
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,540
that was by design.

571
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,540
Did you know that in the Bretton Woods

572
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,540
conference in New Hampshire in 1944,

573
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:38,540
Roosevelt imposed one single rule on his own.

574
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,540
The rest he left to his minions.

575
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,540
They were representatives from

576
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,540
100 different countries.

577
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,540
Most of them already,

578
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,540
they were not even liberated yet.

579
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,540
They were under occupation because it was 1944.

580
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,540
The Second World War had not ended.

581
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,540
Experts, diplomats, politicians and so on.

582
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,540
One species of humanity was banned

583
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:05,540
from entering the Washington Hotel bankers.

584
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,540
A whole monetary global system was created

585
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,540
on condition that bankers would not be part of it.

586
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,540
Yeah, interesting.

587
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,540
If anybody proposed this today,

588
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,540
they would immediately be branded as

589
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,540
raving communist lunatics.

590
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,540
This was Bretton Woods, 1944.

591
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,540
You know, it's important to think back

592
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,540
about possibilities when we think of what is possible.

593
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,540
Well, what happened in 1944 in Bretton Woods

594
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,540
in 1930, 1931 in this country

595
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,540
would have been completely pie in the sky.

596
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,540
So anyway, but that system collapsed

597
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,540
towards the end of the 1960s,

598
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,540
officially 15th of August 1971

599
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,540
with Nixon's announcement that it's kaput, it's finished.

600
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,540
I'm not going to go into this,

601
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,540
but what happened after that was

602
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:59,540
a very interesting, fascinating reversal

603
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,540
in the flow of trade and money around the world.

604
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,540
Before the collapse of Bretton Woods,

605
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,540
what was happening was this.

606
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,540
This is how Bretton Woods was designed.

607
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,540
America was a surplus country.

608
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,540
The country was surplus, with profits.

609
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,540
Especially after the Second World War,

610
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,540
was the only credit of the country.

611
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,540
They had the financial surplus, the surplus of goods

612
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,540
and a tax porter.

613
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,540
And what the United States Administration did

614
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,540
as part of Bretton Woods was to say,

615
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,540
okay, the only way of preventing a return

616
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,540
of the Great Depression to this land by 1949,

617
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,540
they were very worried about 1949

618
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,540
because it was 1929 plus 20.

619
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,540
The only way of preventing it is to make sure that,

620
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,540
okay, number one, we convert all the factories

621
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,540
from military production to civilian production,

622
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,540
using white goods instead of tanks and bullets,

623
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,540
producing cars instead of aircraft carriers.

624
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,540
Right, but that's not enough,

625
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,540
because those factories during the war economy

626
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,540
were so productive in this country

627
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,540
that they were capable of producing

628
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,540
so many washing machine tractors and cars

629
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,540
that Americans would simply not have enough use for them.

630
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,540
The only way of preventing the Great Depression from returning

631
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,540
was by selling them to the Europeans.

632
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,540
But the Europeans didn't have money.

633
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,540
So, new dealers, being very practical,

634
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,540
people said, we'll give them the money.

635
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,540
This is what's called the Marshall Aid Plan,

636
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,540
surplus recycling.

637
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,540
For 20 years, the United States was recycling

638
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:35,540
about 70% of American profits in Japan and in Europe,

639
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,540
because this is what you do if you are a clever hegemon.

640
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,540
What you do is you make sure that the only way

641
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,540
you can continue to have surpluses,

642
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,540
vis-à-vis somebody else, is to finance them.

643
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,540
Because if you don't, then they won't be able

644
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,540
to afford to buy your stuff.

645
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,540
Then you won't be able to have surpluses.

646
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,540
The problem was, however, that those surpluses

647
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,540
disappeared by the late 60s.

648
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,540
America shifted from a surplus position to a deficit position.

649
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,540
Both the government went in deficit

650
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:09,540
and the American economy developed a trade deficit.

651
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:14,540
It is fascinating that what happened after

652
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,540
the collapse of Bretton Woods had been imagined

653
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,540
by some smart fellows in this country.

654
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,540
Remember Henry Kissinger?

655
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,540
Yeah.

656
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,540
Exactly my feelings.

657
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:33,540
But he was a smart cookie, right?

658
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,540
In 1970, a year before the end of Bretton Woods,

659
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,540
he was not yet Secretary of State.

660
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:47,540
He was still head of the National Security Council.

661
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:51,540
Of course, he is a Cold Warrior, geopolitical thinker,

662
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,540
things in terms of a bit like Metternich would have

663
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,540
in the 19th century.

664
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:01,540
He comes from the same part of the world, has the same accent.

665
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:04,540
He asked all the people that were working for him

666
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,540
that pertinent question.

667
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,540
Now that the United States is shifting into a deficit position,

668
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,540
we used to be a...

669
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,540
Now we are going to become a deficit country.

670
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,540
How can we maintain our global hegemony?

671
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:20,540
Because it has never happened in the past.

672
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:25,540
All empires, superpowers fell once they became deficit countries

673
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,540
or economic blocks.

674
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,540
So he was worried about that.

675
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,540
He didn't give a damn about economics,

676
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:32,540
but he cared about power.

677
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,540
A young man wrote a memo.

678
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,540
Thick waters of a page in reply.

679
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,540
It was the most brilliant reply,

680
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,540
and the one that really explains what happened

681
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,540
between the 1970s and 2008 in the world

682
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,540
and of course in the United States.

683
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,540
His answer was, it doesn't really matter

684
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,540
whose surpluses are being recycled.

685
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,540
What really matters to maintain in control

686
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,540
is the one who is recycling other people's surpluses.

687
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,540
Get it?

688
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,540
We can maintain our superpower status, our hegemony,

689
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,540
as long as we do the recycling of surpluses,

690
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,540
even if the surpluses are not ours.

691
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,540
Think about it.

692
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:21,540
This is exactly the model that we have been living through

693
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,540
between the 1970s and 2008.

694
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,540
America turned into a deficit country.

695
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,540
The Trump is complaining,

696
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,540
we have a huge trade deficit with China, with Germany,

697
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,540
we need to eliminate it.

698
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,540
Either he is completely unschooled

699
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,540
or he is lying.

700
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,540
Or both.

701
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:43,540
I added the third option.

702
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:48,540
Because globalization would not have happened

703
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,540
without the American deficits.

704
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:55,540
The American trade deficit operated like a gigantic vacuum cleaner

705
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,540
but was sucking into this country

706
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,540
the net exports of Germany, of Holland, of France, of Japan

707
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,540
and later of course of China.

708
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:08,540
Keeping those factories going at full blast.

709
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:12,540
And this deficit kept increasing.

710
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:16,540
It is this increasing American trade deficit

711
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:22,540
that kept globalized capitalism in rude health.

712
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,540
Of course, the question then is,

713
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,540
how was it being paid for?

714
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,540
Because Greece had a big deficit

715
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,540
and look at what happened to us.

716
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,540
Well, this is the exorbitant privilege

717
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,540
of the United States of America.

718
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:40,540
At the very same time that the trade deficit was expanding,

719
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,540
the rest of the world was sending to this country

720
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,540
70% of all profits that Germans made,

721
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,540
the Dutch made, the Japanese made

722
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,540
and the Chinese are making.

723
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:57,540
70% of global profits were coming into Wall Street,

724
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,540
seeking higher returns,

725
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,540
being used to purchase US Treasury bills,

726
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,540
American government debt

727
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,540
and so you had a pure recycling loop.

728
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:13,540
So recycling was discovered by this young man

729
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,540
whose name by the way is Paul Volcker

730
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,540
who then became the chairman of the Fed

731
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:22,540
a week before he assumed the position of chairman of the Fed

732
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,540
in a lecture he gave at the University of Oregon, England.

733
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,540
He said, this is the time when a controlled disintegration

734
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,540
of the world economy is in the interest

735
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,540
of the United States of America, verbatim,

736
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:37,540
I've learned this off by heart because it's so exciting.

737
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,540
The controlled disintegration of the world economy,

738
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,540
so that's what he meant.

739
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:45,540
So you had this amazing system where

740
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:48,540
you have increasing imbalances globally

741
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,540
America growing its deficits.

742
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,540
Germany and Japan and then China

743
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,540
growing its surpluses.

744
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,540
When we increase our deficit,

745
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,540
we are creating an imbalance.

746
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,540
When somebody else is increasing their surplus,

747
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,540
that's an imbalance.

748
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,540
And globalization was based on this.

749
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,540
Financialization, what's financialization?

750
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,540
Why did Wall Street,

751
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,540
why was Wall Street allowed to go crazy?

752
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,540
Why were all the checks and balances

753
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,540
the newly dealers introduced

754
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,540
and Bretton Woods introduced?

755
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,540
Why did they go to the dogs?

756
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,540
Why did Larry Summers,

757
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,540
I believe he's got some connection with this place.

758
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,540
Why was he allowed to commit the crime against logic and humanity?

759
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,540
To unleash the Wall Street bankers

760
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,540
from their shackles.

761
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,540
The result being 2008.

762
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,540
The answer is, because without

763
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,540
unleashing the Wall Street bankers,

764
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,540
it was impossible to close that loop.

765
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,540
The only way you could have this model of the world economy

766
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:52,540
where the United States deficit

767
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,540
was keeping the rest of globalization going

768
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,540
with the rest of the world

769
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,540
sending its surpluses into Wall Street

770
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,540
for Wall Street to close the loop

771
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,540
and pay for the deficit

772
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,540
was to let the Wall Street bankers do as they pleased.

773
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,540
And when you do let the Wall Street bankers do as they please

774
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,540
you know what they do?

775
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,540
With a banker, a few billion every day

776
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,540
for five minutes

777
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,540
just part five billion with a banker

778
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,540
for five minutes every day.

779
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,540
This is to invite them

780
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,540
to create very sophisticated bets

781
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,540
using that five billion every day

782
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,540
that they are always going to win.

783
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:37,540
If I were to give you five billion every day

784
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,540
for five minutes you would work out ways

785
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,540
of making a load of money

786
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,540
and exponentially increasing load of money.

787
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,540
Anyway, the problem is that they built

788
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,540
so many pyramids of financialized derivatives

789
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,540
on top of this tsunami of capital

790
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,540
that the rest of the world was saying

791
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,540
that it combusted in 2008

792
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,540
and the result was what we're facing.

793
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,540
So, the point I'm making is that

794
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:08,540
first you had the joint sphere of power

795
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,540
then that bisected into the political

796
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,540
and economic sphere

797
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,540
then after the 1970s the end of Bretton Wood

798
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,540
the economic sphere was also divided

799
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,540
and multiplied between the industrial sphere

800
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,540
and the financial sphere.

801
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,540
And all power ended up with finance

802
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,540
because if you allow bankers to push their hand

803
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,540
into the future so majestically, frequently

804
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,540
and without any kind of control

805
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,540
to bring value that has not been produced yet

806
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,540
into the future and effectively to appropriate themselves

807
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,540
and then you also say to them

808
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,540
that they are too big to fail and when they fail

809
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,540
then austerity for all is combined

810
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,540
with socialism for the bankers

811
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,540
then they have no reason

812
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,540
why not to keep undermining capitalism

813
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,540
again and again and again.

814
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,540
So, remember the question with which I started.

815
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,540
Why do politicians seem to be

816
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,540
so much less talented today

817
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,540
than they were, you know, 40 years ago

818
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,540
20 years ago, 30 years ago?

819
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,540
Well, the answer is because the political sphere

820
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,540
is completely powerless.

821
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,540
The spheres that now have acquired power

822
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,540
are the economic sphere and magnificently the financial sphere.

823
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,540
So, if you're a young, talented person

824
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,540
who wants to change the world, who wants to do things?

825
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,540
Who's not very ideological or historical minded?

826
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,540
Who wants power?

827
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,540
What do you want to be president of the United States

828
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,540
or Goldman Sachs?

829
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,540
CEO of Goldman Sachs.

830
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,540
I remember the one long conversation,

831
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,540
longish conversation I had with Barack Obama

832
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:48,540
when I was the finance minister of Greece.

833
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,540
The first thing he said to me was

834
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,540
I feel solidarity for the Greek people

835
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,540
and we are behind you

836
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,540
but there's not much I can do to help.

837
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,540
And then he immediately, without me saying anything

838
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,540
he went into a solidarity justifying himself

839
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,540
by saying, you know, when I got elected

840
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,540
I realized there was nothing I could do

841
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,540
because Wall Street had just imploded

842
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,540
and I had to save them

843
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,540
and that was, he said, political poison for me.

844
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,540
Now, I don't know whether he believed it or not

845
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,540
and I can't see how he can explain the fact

846
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,540
that he appointed Larry Summers to sort out the mess

847
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,540
unless of course, you know, you adopt the cynical view

848
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:32,540
that it takes a murderer to work out

849
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:36,540
how the criminal justice system should be reformed.

850
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:45,540
So this is effectively the point I'm making.

851
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,540
So, is capitalism consistent

852
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:56,540
or sustainable within a democratic polity?

853
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,540
Can it coexist with democracy?

854
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,540
Absolutely not

855
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:06,540
because capitalism is generating this shift of power

856
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,540
away from the political sphere

857
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:13,540
and even if you have fantastically scripted constitutions

858
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,540
beautiful congresses with wonderful procedures and so on

859
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,540
power is going to shift away from those processes

860
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,540
they're going to become fig leaves for a system

861
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,540
where power leaves somewhere else.

862
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:31,540
In my first meeting of finance ministers in Europe

863
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,540
I was exposed to this harsh reality

864
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,540
which I always knew

865
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,540
but it's one thing to know it as a radical lefty

866
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,540
that theorizes

867
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:48,540
and puts forward various working hypotheses

868
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,540
in an academic environment

869
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,540
it's quite another to be told straight in your face.

870
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,540
The beauty of those few months I spent in government

871
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,540
was exactly that

872
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,540
I didn't have to theorize anymore

873
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:04,540
I went to my first meeting of the Eurogroup

874
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,540
the Eurogroup is the meeting of the European Union

875
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:10,540
finance ministers of the countries

876
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,540
that share the same currency the year

877
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,540
So I walked in there and I tried to be as moderate

878
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,540
and as sensible

879
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,540
and as friendly

880
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:25,540
as anyone who comes from a country that is bankrupt

881
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,540
and whose new government has a title

882
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,540
or the party that won

883
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,540
coalition of the radical left

884
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:35,540
So there I was the minister of finance

885
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,540
representing the coalition of the radical left

886
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,540
in that cesspool of conservatism

887
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,540
and I tried to be

888
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,540
all I said was

889
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:49,540
that we are facing a challenge

890
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,540
colleagues

891
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,540
there is the principle I said

892
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,540
of continuity

893
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,540
in democracies

894
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,540
in other words

895
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,540
we are not going to start at year zero

896
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,540
just because we are just elected

897
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:06,540
we have obligations to you

898
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,540
that previous governments, Greek governments

899
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,540
have assumed

900
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,540
and which of course we were against

901
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,540
our party was against but nevertheless

902
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:18,540
our state because of the principle of continuity

903
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,540
still has these obligations to you

904
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,540
and therefore I cannot dismiss them

905
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:24,540
I have to take them seriously

906
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,540
I am obliged by the principle of continuity

907
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,540
at the same time there is another principle

908
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:31,540
the principle of democracy

909
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,540
I could see that we didn't like that very much

910
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,540
and the principle of democracy is very simple

911
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,540
I have a mandate from the people of Greece

912
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,540
to challenge all these obligations

913
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,540
that we have in this particular fiscal

914
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,540
and monetary policy

915
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,540
that you've been imposing upon my country

916
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,540
which led to a great depression

917
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,540
which led me to be here

918
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,540
because if we didn't have a great depression

919
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,540
the Greeks were not stupid enough to vote for me

920
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:58,540
they didn't just become left wingers

921
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,540
our party went from 4% to 40%

922
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,540
in two and a half years because of the great depression

923
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,540
I didn't put it in those very words

924
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,540
but you can imagine

925
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,540
but more or less this was my mandate

926
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,540
I was trying to be extremely open to them

927
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,540
and moderate and conciliatory

928
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,540
with Wolfgang Schäuble

929
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,540
the finance minister of Germany

930
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,540
and I said what happens in democracy

931
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,540
when two principles clash

932
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,540
the principle of continuity and the principle of democracy

933
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,540
well we sit around the table like civilized people

934
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,540
and we find a compromise

935
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,540
this is what democracy do

936
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,540
liberal democracy yes

937
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,540
I sit down, the French minister

938
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,540
loved what I said

939
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,540
of course

940
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,540
just complete hot air

941
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,540
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

942
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,540
I could see Wolfgang Schäuble

943
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,540
the German finance minister

944
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,540
he was looking at me with eyes

945
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,540
that felt like laser beams

946
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,540
and he gets the floor and he said

947
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,540
one sentence, one sentence

948
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,540
which is the one that I'm going to leave you with

949
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,540
elections cannot be allowed

950
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,540
to change economic policy

951
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,540
got it?

952
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,540
my response was

953
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,540
this is excellent news

954
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,540
to the Chinese Communist Party

955
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,540
because they believe that too

956
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,540
and I then came up with a proposal

957
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,540
this is why they hated me

958
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,540
very moderate and said

959
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,540
in that case Wolfgang

960
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,540
let's ban elections

961
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:38,540
in bankrupt countries

962
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,540
let's come out and declare

963
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,540
that in the European Union

964
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,540
you can only have democracy

965
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,540
if you are a credit or country

966
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:49,540
if you are a debt or country

967
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,540
no democracy, elections cannot be allowed

968
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:53,540
to change anything

969
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,540
because we have a loan agreement

970
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,540
we have a debtors prison

971
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,540
let's put Greece in the workhouse

972
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,540
I didn't say all these things

973
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,540
but I did say the thing about the Chinese Communist Party

974
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,540
and also the proposal that we

975
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,540
suspend elections while a country

976
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,540
is in the red

977
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,540
but I'm more honest

978
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,540
so the reason why I'm mentioning this is

979
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,540
that

980
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,540
Shoibley was right

981
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,540
in the capitalist

982
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,540
the globalized

983
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,540
financialized capitalism that we have created

984
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,540
elections cannot be allowed

985
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,540
to change economic policy

986
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,540
because

987
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,540
economic policy simply

988
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,540
springs out of the processes

989
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,540
that I described

990
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,540
and that leave

991
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,540
absolutely no room

992
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,540
for anything beyond a semblance

993
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,540
of a democratic process

994
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,540
that legitimizes

995
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,540
the lack of democracy

996
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,540
we live in pure ironclad

997
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,540
oligarchies

998
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,540
which require for legitimation purposes

999
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,540
and for their reproduction

1000
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,540
that we think that we live in democracies

1001
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,540
now the tragedy is

1002
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,540
that capitalism

1003
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,540
is being overthrown

1004
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:07,540
not by the left

1005
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,540
we are useless

1006
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,540
progressives, left-wingers

1007
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,540
are a catastrophe

1008
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,540
has anybody seen

1009
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,540
the life of Brian, Monty Python's movie

1010
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:19,540
remember the opening scene

1011
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,540
when they all hate each other

1012
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,540
the Jews of

1013
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,540
the liberation front of Judea

1014
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,540
whose worst enemy is the liberation

1015
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,540
people's front of Judea

1016
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,540
that's the left

1017
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,540
we are

1018
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,540
sectarian, we hate each other

1019
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,540
more than we hate anything else

1020
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,540
but

1021
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,540
and when we did overthrow capitalism

1022
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:43,540
we created the gulag

1023
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,540
so we are a disaster

1024
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,540
doesn't mean we shouldn't

1025
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,540
try again to do it properly and democratically

1026
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,540
but

1027
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,540
let's face it capitalism is overthrowing itself

1028
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,540
with no help from us

1029
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,540
and it's doing it in two ways

1030
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,540
firstly

1031
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,540
think of 2008

1032
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,540
this financialization process

1033
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,540
that I described

1034
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,540
imploded under the weight

1035
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,540
of its own hubris

1036
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,540
and the result is a never-ending crisis

1037
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,540
don't believe anybody who tells you that the 2008 crisis ended

1038
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,540
it never ended

1039
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,540
it is continuing

1040
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,540
it is mutating

1041
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,540
it's stating different forms

1042
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,540
it migrates, it goes to different parts of the world

1043
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,540
it takes, for instance in Germany

1044
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,540
it takes the form of negative interest rates

1045
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,540
that are eating into the pension funds

1046
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:31,540
of the average middle-class person

1047
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,540
who then turns against the political system

1048
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,540
and votes for the fascists

1049
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,540
of the alternative for Deutschland

1050
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,540
they don't have an employment

1051
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,540
but they have this sense of deflation

1052
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,540
of their hard-earned savings

1053
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:45,540
that creates

1054
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,540
the rise of xenophobia, racism

1055
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,540
and the ultra-right

1056
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,540
in my country we have a Nazi party in parliament

1057
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,540
because we have a great depression

1058
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,540
because we have an employment rate

1059
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,540
of 30%

1060
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,540
and we have no interest rates

1061
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,540
because nobody is lending to anyone

1062
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,540
because everybody is bankrupt

1063
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,540
in China

1064
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,540
you have

1065
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:09,540
an investment rate

1066
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,540
the proportion of GDP

1067
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,540
of national income

1068
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,540
that goes into investment is gigantic

1069
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,540
it's 48%

1070
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,540
48 cents to every dollar

1071
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,540
earned in China

1072
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,540
goes into investment

1073
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,540
now investment is a good thing

1074
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,540
but our investment simply means

1075
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:29,540
that the Chinese authorities

1076
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:31,540
have given up on the West

1077
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,540
because let's face it

1078
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,540
the only reason why you don't have a great depression

1079
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,540
in this country today

1080
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,540
is because in 2008

1081
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:41,540
which was our version

1082
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,540
of 1929

1083
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,540
two things happened differently

1084
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,540
to what happened in 1929

1085
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,540
one was that the Federal Reserve started printing money

1086
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,540
as if there is no tomorrow

1087
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,540
didn't happen in 1929

1088
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,540
in order to rebalance global capitalism

1089
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,540
they did it very well

1090
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:59,540
but it's not sustainable

1091
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,540
so Europe is not sustainable

1092
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,540
China is not getting sustainable

1093
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,540
and the United States today

1094
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,540
which is celebrating growth

1095
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,540
what growth? you have 2.5% growth

1096
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,540
all the things that shouldn't grow grow

1097
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,540
the things that should grow are not growing

1098
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,540
you do not have

1099
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,540
any serious investment

1100
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:19,540
in good quality jobs in this country

1101
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,540
you have wage stagnation

1102
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,540
you have a situation

1103
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,540
people say oh it's

1104
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,540
this idiocy of the democratic party

1105
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:29,540
that put in one the election against Hillary Clinton

1106
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,540
come on wake up

1107
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,540
you cannot say to Trump voters

1108
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,540
that they're idiots

1109
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,540
and Putin duped them

1110
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,540
you can say that but then that's it

1111
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:41,540
you lose them forever

1112
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,540
and it's also not true

1113
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,540
people say to me how do you explain that Trump won

1114
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,540
I'm an economist so I look at numbers

1115
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,540
the number that I think is most spectacular

1116
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,540
in this country is that in 2016

1117
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,540
more than half of the families

1118
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,540
in this country could not afford

1119
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,540
the cheapest new car which cost 14000

1120
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,540
either they didn't have the money

1121
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,540
or they didn't have the money

1122
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,540
and they did not have the credit ratings

1123
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,540
necessary to borrow 14000

1124
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,540
more than half of the families cannot afford the cheapest car

1125
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:11,540
that's why Trump got elected

1126
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,540
because Obama failed

1127
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,540
spectacularly to shift

1128
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,540
the burdens of the crisis of the financial sector

1129
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,540
onto the 0.1%

1130
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,540
So

1131
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:25,540
I've spoken far too long

1132
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,540
let's end on a positive note

1133
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,540
Shall we?

1134
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,540
Technically

1135
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,540
it's really very simple

1136
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,540
how to solve the problem

1137
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,540
or how to begin a process

1138
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,540
we need a new deal

1139
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,540
except that this must be an international new deal

1140
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,540
exactly as the new deal was

1141
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,540
in 1933

1142
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,540
but globally

1143
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,540
that's not new

1144
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,540
Bretton Woods was an international new deal

1145
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,540
so we need a new Bretton Woods

1146
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,540
we need progressives in this country

1147
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:05,540
progressives in Europe

1148
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,540
to get an act together and start collaborating

1149
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,540
because you know the bankers are very good

1150
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,540
at being internationalists

1151
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:13,540
they love each other

1152
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,540
they love each other

1153
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,540
they have very good

1154
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,540
only we progressives

1155
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,540
fail to get together

1156
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,540
and start believing

1157
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,540
that it is possible to do that which

1158
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:27,540
has already been done before

1159
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,540
it's not buying the sky stuff

1160
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:31,540
now

1161
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,540
this in order to ameliorate the effects

1162
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,540
of the ongoing crisis after 2008

1163
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,540
the fact is that

1164
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,540
we need a new deal

1165
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,540
to ameliorate the effects of the ongoing crisis

1166
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:43,540
after 2008

1167
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,540
then once we stabilize the world

1168
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,540
like

1169
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,540
Bretton Woods stabilized the world after the Second World War

1170
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,540
then we can start

1171
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:53,540
thinking about postcapitalism

1172
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,540
because we must

1173
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,540
capitalism is over turning itself

1174
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,540
not only through its crisis

1175
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,540
but also through the technologies that it is creating

1176
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,540
3D printing

1177
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,540
artificial intelligence

1178
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,540
the internet

1179
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:09,540
there will be no need to have a corporation

1180
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,540
corporations will lack their zone

1181
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:13,540
the only reason why you have general models

1182
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,540
is the economies of scale

1183
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,540
economies of scale are dying because of the new technologies

1184
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,540
that capitalism is creating

1185
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,540
so you are going to have a situation

1186
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,540
in which

1187
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,540
we are going to have magnificent productivity

1188
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,540
magnificent

1189
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,540
capacity to produce stuff

1190
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,540
but the large majority

1191
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,540
will not be able to buy any of it

1192
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,540
so that will be a crisis of

1193
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:37,540
not just the poor

1194
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,540
but also the haves

1195
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,540
but we must never

1196
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,540
believe that because there is going to be a crisis of capitalism

1197
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,540
because capitalism is going to undermine

1198
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,540
and overthrow itself

1199
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,540
good things will happen

1200
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,540
in the 1930s

1201
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,540
capitalism imploded

1202
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,540
and Nazism happened

1203
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,540
so we can have

1204
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,540
one certainty

1205
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,540
capitalism cannot maintain itself

1206
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,540
something else

1207
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,540
another system of organizing

1208
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,540
economic and political life is going to follow

1209
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,540
and we better make sure

1210
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,540
that the way in which we choose

1211
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,540
as a species, as a humanity

1212
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,540
that different way

1213
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,540
of doing things is selected

1214
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,540
democratically because even though democracy

1215
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,540
takes too long

1216
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,540
as Oscar Wilde said socialism

1217
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:27,540
would never happen because it takes too many long evenings

1218
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:31,540
and it's tedious

1219
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,540
there's no doubt about that

1220
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,540
if you've been to a political meeting

1221
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,540
you know how tedious it is

1222
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,540
it's the only choice we have

1223
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,540
thankfully we are creating the technologies

1224
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,540
that will make these debates

1225
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,540
both more manageable

1226
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,540
and more hopeful in terms of

1227
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,540
delivering a future that resembles

1228
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,540
as I say in the book

1229
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,540
Star Trek and not the Matrix

1230
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,540
thank you

1231
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,540
You're a very interesting combination

1232
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,540
of idealism

1233
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:07,540
and pragmatism

1234
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:09,540
identified the problem

1235
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,540
that we have here

1236
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,540
which led to somehow

1237
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,540
Trump being elected

1238
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,540
yet

1239
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,540
that terrible inequality

1240
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,540
which has gotten way worse

1241
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,540
in the last 12 months

1242
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,540
and looks like it's going to get worse

1243
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:27,540
even more get worse again

1244
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,540
did not produce

1245
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,540
enough people to elect Bernie Sanders

1246
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,540
and I went to his rallies

1247
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,540
and he said great things

1248
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,540
do you think that this country

1249
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,540
just can't wrap its head around

1250
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,540
that word socialist

1251
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,540
and that's my question

1252
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,540
is does it have to repackage the thinking

1253
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,540
Well

1254
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,540
I used to think that

1255
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,540
until Bernie Sanders called himself a socialist

1256
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,540
and won the primary election

1257
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,540
they were stolen from him

1258
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,540
Bernie Sanders won the election

1259
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,540
or he would have won the election

1260
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,540
if the National Democratic Committee

1261
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,540
did not do its utmost

1262
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,540
to perform a coup d'etat against him

1263
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,540
and I'm stating this

1264
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,540
as an accusation

1265
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,540
the Democratic Party

1266
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,540
is its own worst enemy

1267
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,540
So given that

1268
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:23,540
this is the substrate that we have to work with

1269
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,540
how do we change the thinking

1270
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:27,540
if we want the things that that party

1271
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,540
is proposing

1272
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,540
how do we get

1273
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,540
the electorate to change their voting

1274
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,540
why did they vote for Trump

1275
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,540
why

1276
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,540
Well

1277
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:41,540
firstly

1278
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:43,540
the abstention rate was quite high

1279
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,540
a lot of good people

1280
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:47,540
could simply not bring themselves

1281
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:49,540
to vote for Hillary

1282
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,540
and they didn't vote at all

1283
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,540
and many others

1284
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,540
but

1285
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,540
I wasn't here during your election campaign

1286
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,540
but I was in Britain

1287
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,540
before the Brexit referendum

1288
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,540
and I believe that there are great similarities between the two

1289
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,540
and I remember I was campaigning against Brexit

1290
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,540
in Britain

1291
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,540
in the same way I would have campaigned against Trump here

1292
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,540
of course

1293
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,540
and I remember asking people

1294
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,540
who were

1295
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,540
not racist

1296
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,540
who were not xenophobic

1297
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,540
who were not right-wing

1298
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,540
why are you voting for Brexit

1299
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:25,540
and the answer had nothing to do with Europe

1300
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,540
the answer was this

1301
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,540
if I vote

1302
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:31,540
to remain

1303
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,540
in the European Union

1304
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,540
those bastards that have been treating me

1305
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,540
like a discarded

1306
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,540
piece of rag

1307
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,540
a discarded rag

1308
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,540
are going to be very happy

1309
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,540
so I'm going to cast my vote in a manner

1310
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,540
that maximizes the discomfort

1311
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:49,540
of those who have been treating me

1312
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,540
as if I'm not a human

1313
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,540
now

1314
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,540
I don't know

1315
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,540
you have to tell me whether this is

1316
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,540
an appropriate comparison

1317
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:01,540
to what was going on here

1318
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:03,540
a lot of people who voted for Trump

1319
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,540
simply wanted to punish the establishment

1320
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,540
and they wanted

1321
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,540
I think that there is quite a lot of supporting evidence

1322
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,540
of course there are racists

1323
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,540
and there are Nazis

1324
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,540
and there are right-wingers

1325
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,540
and bigots and misogynists who voted for Trump

1326
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,540
but they made the difference

1327
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,540
the ones who made the difference

1328
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,540
were the ones who could not afford the car

1329
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,540
the ones who had believed in Obama

1330
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,540
and who voted for Obama in 2008

1331
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,540
from what I'm reading at the data

1332
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,540
and there seems to be a very large number of voters

1333
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,540
who voted for Obama in 2008

1334
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,540
and Trump in 2016

1335
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,540
now that cannot be explained

1336
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,540
on the basis of racism

1337
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,540
it cannot be explained on the basis of

1338
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,540
misogyny

1339
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,540
it is simply

1340
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,540
to hell with you

1341
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:49,540
I am not going to vindicate

1342
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,540
yet again

1343
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,540
a presidential candidate

1344
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,540
who goes into Wall Street

1345
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:57,540
six months before the presidential election

1346
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,540
gives

1347
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,540
private speeches for hundreds of thousands

1348
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,540
of dollars

1349
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,540
and

1350
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,540
excuse the language

1351
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,540
shits on people like me

1352
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:11,540
in front of the bankers calling me names

1353
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,540
and promising to them

1354
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,540
that they will be allowed to continue doing that

1355
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,540
which has put us and our country

1356
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,540
in this position

1357
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,540
So, trying to be optimistic

1358
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,540
from a moment

1359
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,540
if we were trying to create

1360
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,540
some kind of apparatus

1361
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:31,540
I mean in the 50s

1362
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,540
Roosevelt did the very thing that they said was impossible

1363
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:35,540
he put 90% tax

1364
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,540
on corporate America

1365
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,540
to fund all these great schemes

1366
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,540
the social security system

1367
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:43,540
you know Medicare

1368
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,540
these things were made possible

1369
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,540
but the workers had unions then

1370
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:49,540
quite strong unions

1371
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:51,540
now that's all been taken away

1372
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,540
how are people going to

1373
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,540
organize and overthrow the system

1374
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,540
as you say

1375
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,540
I mean it may implode but in the interim

1376
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:01,540
people are just surviving on

1377
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,540
ten dollar an hour wages

1378
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,540
or not surviving

1379
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,540
so where is the impetus for evolution

1380
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,540
you do not need punitive tax rates now

1381
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,540
you don't need 90%

1382
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,540
this was a gimmick anyway

1383
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:15,540
No, but it worked

1384
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,540
Yeah, I mean it was more of a political stunt

1385
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,540
I don't believe that it is

1386
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:21,540
necessary to have such high tax rates

1387
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,540
but what you do need

1388
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,540
is you need to change the discourse

1389
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,540
in a way that appeals

1390
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,540
not only to those who would have joined

1391
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,540
trade unions but to people who would never

1392
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,540
have imagined themselves to be radical

1393
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:35,540
or even progressive

1394
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,540
So let me give you an example, take NAFTA

1395
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,540
there is a lot of discussion in this country

1396
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:41,540
now about NAFTA

1397
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,540
the liberal establishment says

1398
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,540
oh you know free trade is everything

1399
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,540
the pie is going to shrink

1400
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,540
if you do away with it

1401
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,540
but some people in

1402
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,540
the Rust Belt say

1403
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,540
well that's your pie, that's not my pie

1404
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,540
my pie has disappeared a long time ago

1405
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,540
so if I can manage to hold on to a few

1406
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:01,540
you know still workers jobs

1407
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,540
by means of tariffs

1408
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,540
let's do it because it's better

1409
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,540
than all of us being thrown into

1410
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,540
the dustbin

1411
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,540
why not change the narrative

1412
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,540
and to say

1413
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,540
yes we want to renegotiate NAFTA

1414
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,540
along the following lines

1415
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:21,540
if Mexico wants

1416
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,540
to continue to have

1417
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:25,540
or Mexican capitalists

1418
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:27,540
want to continue to have

1419
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,540
free access to the American market

1420
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,540
Mexico is going to have to introduce

1421
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,540
a minimum wage in Mexico

1422
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,540
but it provides a living wage

1423
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:37,540
by Mexican standards

1424
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,540
not by American standards

1425
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,540
to the workers who work in the factories

1426
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,540
that produces stuff that are then transported

1427
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,540
over to the United States

1428
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,540
now that is a progressive renegotiation

1429
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,540
of NAFTA

1430
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:51,540
not tariffs but minimum living wages

1431
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:53,540
in the poorer countries

1432
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,540
ok so that way

1433
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,540
not building a wall

1434
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,540
of course not building a wall

1435
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:01,540
but then you wouldn't need to bring it to build a wall

1436
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,540
so that is one example

1437
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,540
take for instance

1438
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:07,540
the question about the health service here

1439
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:09,540
the health system

1440
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,540
well you don't have a health system

1441
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,540
the absence of a health system

1442
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:15,540
Obamacare was a complete disaster

1443
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,540
Obamacare

1444
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,540
is an affront against logic

1445
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,540
the idea of universal cover

1446
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,540
is absolutely essential

1447
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,540
but also the idea that

1448
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,540
the state is going to be subsidizing

1449
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:31,540
private companies to provide public health

1450
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,540
without any controls

1451
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:35,540
regarding the prices of the

1452
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,540
services and the pharmaceuticals

1453
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:39,540
is a catastrophe

1454
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,540
it's like effectively

1455
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,540
subsidizing the private insurance

1456
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,540
this is why of course

1457
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,540
they contributed massively to Obama's campaign

1458
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,540
without the so called public option

1459
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:53,540
it's ludicrous

1460
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,540
so how about the following argument

1461
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:57,540
about having

1462
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:59,540
a proper national health service

1463
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,540
a public health service system

1464
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,540
in the United States

1465
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:05,540
so that we can introduce tax cuts

1466
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,540
think about that

1467
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,540
that would really throw the Republicans wouldn't it

1468
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,540
because your tax

1469
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,540
your health system

1470
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:15,540
is the most expensive in the world

1471
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,540
you pay twice as much on health

1472
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,540
than the rest of the world

1473
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:21,540
and you have far worse outcomes

1474
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,540
so imagine that you created a proper public system

1475
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,540
you'd save a huge amount of money

1476
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:27,540
public money

1477
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,540
and then you could give them

1478
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:31,540
give them away as tax cuts

1479
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:33,540
but why not also say that

1480
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,540
those tax cuts will go to the lowest wage

1481
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:37,540
earners not to the top

1482
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:39,540
so that's how you change the debate

1483
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:41,540
you get out of the way

1484
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:43,540
of the stereotype

1485
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:45,540
that the Republicans are trying to create for you

1486
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:49,540
and you subvert the dominant way of thinking

1487
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:51,540
So I would like to hug the questioning

1488
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,540
but I don't think it's fair

1489
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,540
because I'm sure there are lots of good questions

1490
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:57,540
that are going to come from the audience

1491
01:01:57,540 --> 01:01:59,540
so I'm going to open up the questions

1492
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,540
and if you could confine it to one

1493
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:03,540
I would be appreciative

1494
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:05,540
It may be one and a half

1495
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,540
I thought for a minute your talk was going to be almost entirely about Harvard

1496
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:09,540
Marshall

1497
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:11,540
who announced it at Harvard commencement

1498
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,540
Kissinger

1499
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:15,540
and then Larry Summers

1500
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,540
I'd say

1501
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:19,540
have this idea that maybe Obama was

1502
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,540
put in the White House

1503
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,540
to bail out Harvard

1504
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,540
that whose endowment went from

1505
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:27,540
losing 11 billion to regaining it

1506
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:31,540
I think many people in this country

1507
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:33,540
are still not convinced

1508
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:35,540
that Obama did have a choice

1509
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:37,540
Now you said

1510
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:39,540
I believe that he did

1511
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:41,540
but can you be a little more specific about

1512
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:43,540
and you sort of writ large

1513
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,540
you talk about a new deal

1514
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,540
but are you more specific about what

1515
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,540
a person in the White House

1516
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:51,540
could have done

1517
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,540
what it would have looked like

1518
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,540
that would have been more like bailing out Wall Street

1519
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:57,540
more like bailing out Main Street

1520
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,540
than bailing out Wall Street

1521
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,540
and can you explain

1522
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:03,540
why the social democratic politics

1523
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,540
of building a politics

1524
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,540
where we control the government

1525
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:09,540
and regulate capitalism

1526
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,540
is not the way to go

1527
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:13,540
but some other alternative politics

1528
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,540
is what you're implying

1529
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:17,540
but you haven't really I don't think spelled out

1530
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:19,540
Ok, I'll start from the second part

1531
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:21,540
Look

1532
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,540
the new deal that I am suggesting

1533
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:25,540
as a first step

1534
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,540
is social democratic

1535
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,540
but in the good old fashioned sense

1536
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,540
of it

1537
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,540
so you need social democratic measures

1538
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:35,540
to stabilize the political economy

1539
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:37,540
before we can have a genuine conversation

1540
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,540
about what comes next

1541
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,540
the more radical part

1542
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:43,540
for instance changing corporate law

1543
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:45,540
I mean corporate law

1544
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:47,540
is a political value judgment

1545
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,540
so when some corporation

1546
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:51,540
goes bust

1547
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,540
who gets paid first

1548
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:55,540
amongst the creditors

1549
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:57,540
is a political decision

1550
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,540
so why not change it

1551
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:01,540
why have the bankers get paid first

1552
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,540
and the workers last

1553
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,540
why allow people to own shares

1554
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:07,540
in a company in which they don't work

1555
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:09,540
this is very radical I don't know

1556
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:11,540
where you can only have shares in a company

1557
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:13,540
in which you actually provide labor

1558
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:15,540
then you have socialism

1559
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:17,540
but without state control

1560
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:19,540
so that's the second

1561
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,540
part of the second question

1562
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:23,540
but let's go back to Obama, did he have a choice

1563
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,540
of course he had a choice

1564
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:27,540
he could have appointed as

1565
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,540
instead of appointing

1566
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,540
team guide there and Larry Summers

1567
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:33,540
he could have appointed Elizabeth Warren

1568
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,540
with a mandate

1569
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,540
to save the banks

1570
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:39,540
or operate the bankers

1571
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,540
which is not a new idea

1572
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:43,540
in 1992

1573
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:45,540
the Swedish banks

1574
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:47,540
actually all the Scandinavian banks went bust

1575
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:49,540
and what the governments did then

1576
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,540
was to say to the bankers ok, out

1577
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:53,540
they took over the banks, they nationalized them

1578
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:55,540
put in a new board of directors

1579
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,540
and within two years

1580
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:59,540
they had sold them back to the private sector

1581
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:01,540
but cleansed, the original bankers had gone

1582
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:03,540
with new regulations

1583
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,540
he didn't do that

1584
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:07,540
he left Jamie Dimon

1585
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:09,540
Goldman Sachs

1586
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:11,540
intact all the structures of power

1587
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,540
in 2009

1588
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:15,540
when he moved into the White House

1589
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,540
for about six to eight months

1590
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:19,540
I grant you

1591
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,540
not more than that

1592
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:23,540
he had a window of opportunity

1593
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:25,540
he had a whole nation behind him

1594
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:27,540
he could have done that

1595
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,540
even libertarians would have approved

1596
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,540
of expropriating the bankers

1597
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:33,540
he didn't

1598
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:35,540
but it was him

1599
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:37,540
to create the so called

1600
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:39,540
Summers Geithner plan

1601
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:41,540
if you haven't studied that

1602
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,540
go and study it

1603
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,540
it is a remarkable

1604
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:47,540
ingenious way

1605
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,540
of

1606
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:51,540
conjuring up

1607
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,540
around nine trillion dollars

1608
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:55,540
and giving it to the bankers without anybody realizing it

1609
01:05:57,540 --> 01:05:59,540
you remember the bailout that Hank Paulson came up with

1610
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:01,540
was 700 billion

1611
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,540
initially he was defeated

1612
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,540
in congress

1613
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:07,540
and then he managed to push it through

1614
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:09,540
700 billion spinnets

1615
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,540
Geithner and Summers

1616
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:13,540
created nine trillion

1617
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,540
without anybody realizing it

1618
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,540
ok

1619
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,540
so Obama had a choice to do it

1620
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:21,540
and he did it

1621
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:23,540
now we are paying for it

1622
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:25,540
because Trump is president

1623
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,540
I've been very concerned

1624
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:31,540
lately about China

1625
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:33,540
and sort of there

1626
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:35,540
we have transferred so much money

1627
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:37,540
from our economy

1628
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,540
over to China

1629
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:41,540
by buying all those things

1630
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,540
and supporting their economy over there

1631
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,540
so they could make more and more money

1632
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:47,540
they are now all over

1633
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:49,540
Africa

1634
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,540
buying things and

1635
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,540
investing over there

1636
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:55,540
and getting those countries dependent on them

1637
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:57,540
and supporting

1638
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:59,540
these democratic people

1639
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,540
and I'm just wondering

1640
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,540
like whom

1641
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:05,540
we are in a country that supports Saudi Arabia

1642
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:07,540
yes that's true

1643
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:09,540
suddenly we have a problem

1644
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:11,540
with

1645
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:13,540
superpowers supporting non-democratic people

1646
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:17,540
yes I mean yes I do

1647
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:19,540
but I also am concerned

1648
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,540
that we've sort of created

1649
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,540
the economic power that China

1650
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,540
sort of has now and they are using it

1651
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:27,540
I fear

1652
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:29,540
I'm going to be using it against us eventually

1653
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:31,540
and against

1654
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:33,540
the better interests of a lot of people

1655
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,540
allow me to put your mind to rest

1656
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:37,540
you shouldn't worry about that

1657
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:39,540
ok

1658
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:41,540
very simple

1659
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:43,540
and let me explain why you shouldn't worry about that

1660
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:45,540
but please continue

1661
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:47,540
I mean

1662
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:51,540
you know

1663
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:53,540
they are in Africa

1664
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:55,540
they are making money to countries to build ports

1665
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,540
and different infrastructure

1666
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,540
and what's wrong with that

1667
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:01,540
countries that need ports

1668
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,540
get ports

1669
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:05,540
but they are making people dependent on

1670
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,540
I mean I know it's the same thing that we've done

1671
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:09,540
which is affordable around the world

1672
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,540
they are far more humanistic

1673
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:13,540
than the United States ever was

1674
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,540
really? ok

1675
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:17,540
let me give you an example

1676
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:19,540
of course they are peddling

1677
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:21,540
for influence

1678
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:23,540
but they are non-interventionists

1679
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,540
absolutely non-interventionists

1680
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:27,540
in a way that Europeans

1681
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:29,540
the West has never managed to fathom

1682
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:31,540
but I have a feeling

1683
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,540
they have a longer term thought process

1684
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,540
that is more

1685
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:37,540
but let's judge what we see

1686
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:39,540
let's start at the beginning

1687
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:45,540
the Chinese never asked Apple

1688
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:47,540
to go to Shenzhen

1689
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,540
produce all the iPhones

1690
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:51,540
because Steve Jobs have decided that

1691
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,540
it was not China

1692
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,540
that

1693
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,540
went to Washington DC

1694
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:03,540
and demanded

1695
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,540
that they buy a third of your national debt

1696
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:09,540
if they hadn't bought it

1697
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:11,540
you would be in serious trouble

1698
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:13,540
number three

1699
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:15,540
I did allude to this

1700
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:17,540
in my talk

1701
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:19,540
in 2008 China had not cranked up

1702
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:21,540
their credit bubble

1703
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,540
you would be in a great depression

1704
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:25,540
now

1705
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,540
so China

1706
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,540
the United States and the European Union

1707
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,540
are absolutely

1708
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:33,540
synergistic

1709
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,540
and they need one another

1710
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:37,540
in a way that

1711
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:39,540
if we

1712
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:41,540
failed to acknowledge and to nurture

1713
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:45,540
billions of people

1714
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:47,540
including

1715
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:49,540
the majority of the people in this country

1716
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:51,540
are going to suffer

1717
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:53,540
now

1718
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:55,540
I am not going to stand here

1719
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:57,540
and defend China

1720
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:59,540
and the Chinese Communist Party

1721
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:01,540
I already made some negative remarks

1722
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:03,540
about the Chinese Communist Party

1723
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:05,540
in referring to

1724
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,540
their attitudes as being

1725
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:09,540
compatible

1726
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,540
with those of Wolfgang Schroeble

1727
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:13,540
my concern about China

1728
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,540
is the

1729
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,540
authoritarian manner

1730
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:19,540
in which the Chinese regime

1731
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:21,540
is treating the Chinese people

1732
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:23,540
as a democrat, I have a problem with this

1733
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,540
mind you

1734
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:27,540
I have to tell you that

1735
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:29,540
from my understanding of China

1736
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:31,540
it's a very interesting social experiment

1737
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,540
in the sense that

1738
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,540
at the local level

1739
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:37,540
the regional level

1740
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:39,540
you now have a boisterous democracy

1741
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,540
at the local and regional level

1742
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:43,540
even with

1743
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,540
popular

1744
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:47,540
success stories in overthrowing

1745
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,540
local

1746
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:51,540
authorities, local

1747
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:53,540
bureaucrats who have been corrupt

1748
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,540
who have been this, who have been that, who have been the other

1749
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:59,540
when it comes to the

1750
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,540
influence of China outside

1751
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:03,540
its borders, I have to say

1752
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:05,540
firstly, it's quite remarkable that they

1753
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:07,540
don't seem to have any military

1754
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:09,540
ambitions

1755
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:11,540
secondly

1756
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:13,540
Africa

1757
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:15,540
I'll give you an example

1758
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,540
a specific example

1759
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:19,540
Ethiopia

1760
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:21,540
2004, because it happened to be there

1761
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,540
and I have some

1762
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,540
first-person

1763
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,540
first-hand experience of it

1764
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:29,540
they went into Ethiopia

1765
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:31,540
I'll tell you why they went into Ethiopia

1766
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:33,540
because they suspected it was oil

1767
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,540
because China is

1768
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:37,540
a major industrial power

1769
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,540
but it lacks primary resources

1770
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,540
now, instead of going

1771
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:43,540
into Africa with troops

1772
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:45,540
colonially destroying the country

1773
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:47,540
killing people like the west has done

1774
01:11:47,540 --> 01:11:49,540
for the last 100 years

1775
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:51,540
what they did was, they went to

1776
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,540
Adithababa and they said to the government

1777
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:55,540
we would like, we can see

1778
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,540
you have problems with your infrastructure

1779
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:59,540
we would like to build some new airports

1780
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:03,540
upgrade your railway system

1781
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:05,540
create a telephone system

1782
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:07,540
and rebuild your roads

1783
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:09,540
and we'll do this all for free

1784
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,540
no strings attached, we don't want

1785
01:12:11,540 --> 01:12:13,540
anything from you

1786
01:12:13,540 --> 01:12:15,540
and they did, why did they do it?

1787
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:17,540
because it's soft power

1788
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:19,540
now, because they knew

1789
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:21,540
that if oil is

1790
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:23,540
discovered, and it was discovered later

1791
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:25,540
then

1792
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:27,540
of course, the Ethiopian government

1793
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:29,540
will be much more open to Chinese

1794
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:31,540
oil companies coming there

1795
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:33,540
they have never combined

1796
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,540
their investment

1797
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:37,540
with imperialistic

1798
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:41,540
when I was minister of finance

1799
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:43,540
I had a very interesting

1800
01:12:43,540 --> 01:12:45,540
experience with Costco

1801
01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:47,540
one of the Chinese national companies

1802
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,540
that in the end bought the port of Piraeus

1803
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,540
when I moved into the ministry

1804
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:57,540
I found a contract

1805
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,540
from the previous government

1806
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:01,540
the port of Piraeus

1807
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:03,540
for a pittance and other ridiculous conditions

1808
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:05,540
to the Chinese

1809
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:07,540
under the guidance

1810
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:09,540
of course of the European Union and International Monetary Fund

1811
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:11,540
as well

1812
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:13,540
and in other ways I was

1813
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:15,540
as a minister I was

1814
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:17,540
bound to a particular

1815
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,540
deal that was terrible for Greece

1816
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:21,540
and I went to the Chinese

1817
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:23,540
and discussed it with them

1818
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:25,540
and I was really astonished

1819
01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:27,540
I said to them look, you're paying too little

1820
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:29,540
you're not committing to a sufficient

1821
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:31,540
level of investment

1822
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,540
and you are treating our workers

1823
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:35,540
as fodder

1824
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:37,540
you are effectively subcontracting labor

1825
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:39,540
to horrible companies

1826
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,540
that exploit the workers

1827
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:43,540
and I can't deal with this

1828
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:45,540
effectively

1829
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:47,540
I proposed to them

1830
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:49,540
to renegotiate the contract

1831
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:51,540
so instead of getting 67% of the shares

1832
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:53,540
of the port they would get with the same price

1833
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:55,540
51%

1834
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:57,540
the remaining shares would go into

1835
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:59,540
the Greek pension fund system

1836
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,540
in order to bolster

1837
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:03,540
the capitalization of the public pensions

1838
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,540
secondly

1839
01:14:05,540 --> 01:14:07,540
I want you to commit

1840
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,540
to 180 million euros

1841
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:11,540
of investment within 12 months

1842
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:13,540
and thirdly

1843
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:15,540
proper collective bargaining with the trade unions

1844
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:17,540
and no subcontracting of labor

1845
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:19,540
and to my astonishment

1846
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:21,540
they said ok

1847
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,540
can you imagine if that was a German company

1848
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:25,540
or an American company

1849
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:27,540
that's what I'm saying, I don't think you should worry

1850
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,540
ok, I won't

1851
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:37,540
hi

1852
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,540
hi, big fan Janis

1853
01:14:39,540 --> 01:14:41,540
nice to see you in person

1854
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:43,540
and I hope you don't mind that I'll struggle

1855
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:45,540
to give you a short question

1856
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:47,540
instead of an essay

1857
01:14:47,540 --> 01:14:49,540
so basically

1858
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:51,540
one angle that

1859
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,540
was missing from tonight's talk

1860
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:55,540
is the angle of

1861
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:57,540
class formations

1862
01:14:57,540 --> 01:14:59,540
so the new deal was born out of

1863
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:01,540
I believe

1864
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,540
about easily 50-60 years

1865
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,540
of left wing organizing

1866
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,540
among the industrial working classes

1867
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:09,540
who basically

1868
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:11,540
as we would always say on our slogans

1869
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,540
had their hands on the wheels

1870
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:15,540
when they went on strike they could stop production

1871
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,540
stop the flow of profits

1872
01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:19,540
and so on and so on

1873
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:21,540
by the time the Great Depression came

1874
01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:23,540
there was a crisis

1875
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:25,540
there was a place for labor

1876
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:27,540
and the left at the bargaining table

1877
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:29,540
I guess

1878
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:31,540
what I want to ask is

1879
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:33,540
let's take neoliberalism at a kind of good faith

1880
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,540
and say there really was a change

1881
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:37,540
in the class formation

1882
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,540
that allowed them to just throw out Bretton Woods

1883
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:41,540
and say we don't want to commit to this deal anymore

1884
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:43,540
you don't have the power

1885
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:45,540
effectively your bargaining terms

1886
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:47,540
oh laborers are not so good anymore

1887
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:49,540
so then

1888
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:51,540
that leaves us today

1889
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:53,540
where are we

1890
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:55,540
who does have their hands on the wheel

1891
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:57,540
I mean

1892
01:15:57,540 --> 01:15:59,540
here we are Cambridge, Massachusetts

1893
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:01,540
large portion of the population works in

1894
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:03,540
white collar professions

1895
01:16:03,540 --> 01:16:05,540
many of them are homeowners

1896
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:07,540
in traditional

1897
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:09,540
there aren't a lot of traditional industrial workers

1898
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:11,540
in this room

1899
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:13,540
on the other hand the traditional industrial workers

1900
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:15,540
in Ohio or wherever

1901
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:17,540
are losing their jobs quite rapidly

1902
01:16:17,540 --> 01:16:19,540
due to mechanization

1903
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,540
and offshoring

1904
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,540
so

1905
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:25,540
who can put the worker's gun

1906
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:27,540
to the capitalist class's head anymore

1907
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:31,540
good question

1908
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:33,540
but I have to disagree with you on one thing

1909
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:35,540
and sorry to sound a bit tanky on you

1910
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:37,540
no no no you're not tanky

1911
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:39,540
it is the pertinent question

1912
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:41,540
the one you asked

1913
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:43,540
I don't have a

1914
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:45,540
splendid answer to it

1915
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:47,540
but where I want to disagree with you

1916
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,540
is that in 1933

1917
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:51,540
or 32

1918
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,540
it was the labor movement

1919
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:55,540
that imposed

1920
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:57,540
its will using its power

1921
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:59,540
there was no power

1922
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:01,540
the 1929 great

1923
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:03,540
the great crash and then the depression that followed

1924
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:05,540
completely depleted

1925
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:07,540
trade unions of any bargaining power

1926
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,540
when you have a situation

1927
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:11,540
where you've got hordes of people

1928
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:13,540
outside the factory gates

1929
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:15,540
begging to be allowed into work

1930
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:17,540
at any wage

1931
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:19,540
you don't have trade union power

1932
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:21,540
so it was a political process

1933
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:23,540
that led

1934
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:25,540
not a labor process

1935
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,540
that led to the new deal

1936
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:29,540
and let's not forget that FDR was not a revolutionary leader

1937
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:31,540
he was a patrician

1938
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:33,540
he was a bourgeois

1939
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:35,540
even Keynes

1940
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:37,540
but Keynes

1941
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:39,540
Keynes hated the workers

1942
01:17:39,540 --> 01:17:41,540
trade unions

1943
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:43,540
the reason why he introduced Keynesian economics

1944
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:45,540
his proposals

1945
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,540
which included increasing wages

1946
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:49,540
and welfare states

1947
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:51,540
and

1948
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:53,540
fiscal spending

1949
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:55,540
fiscal stimulus and so on

1950
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:57,540
was very simple

1951
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:59,540
he wanted to preserve capitalism

1952
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:01,540
and he understood that capitalism was not very good at preserving itself

1953
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:03,540
that's a very large part

1954
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,540
of the motivation of Roosevelt

1955
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:07,540
it was not that he was being pushed

1956
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:09,540
by the industrial might

1957
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:11,540
of the labor unions

1958
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:13,540
so that gives you a bit of hope

1959
01:18:13,540 --> 01:18:15,540
since that didn't happen then

1960
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:17,540
maybe we don't need

1961
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:19,540
strong trade unions today

1962
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:21,540
today I think that

1963
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:23,540
from a class formation point of view

1964
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:25,540
what is me

1965
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:27,540
and what I think is the

1966
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:29,540
the

1967
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:31,540
should be the objective

1968
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,540
is how to organize

1969
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:35,540
the precariat

1970
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:37,540
those who live precarious existence

1971
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:39,540
the uberized workers

1972
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:41,540
into a political force

1973
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:43,540
because they now are

1974
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:45,540
falling through the cracks of society

1975
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,540
they are like the lumpenproletariat used to be

1976
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:49,540
they are disappearing

1977
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:51,540
I mean

1978
01:18:51,540 --> 01:18:53,540
a person who works

1979
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:55,540
18 hours a day in an uber

1980
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:57,540
is not a person

1981
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,540
it's a lost soul

1982
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,540
it's a moving

1983
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:03,540
monument to

1984
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:05,540
to misanthropy

1985
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,540
so that for me

1986
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:09,540
is a major question

1987
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:11,540
but

1988
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:13,540
allow me just to be

1989
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:15,540
to shift in towards

1990
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:17,540
something that may sound science fiction

1991
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:19,540
but I don't think it is

1992
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:21,540
we need to think

1993
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:25,540
innovatively about collective action

1994
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:27,540
I do not believe

1995
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:29,540
that the revolution is going to come through trade unions

1996
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:31,540
in industrial sites

1997
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,540
but simply because they are fading

1998
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:35,540
unless the robots organize

1999
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:37,540
and they do the revolution on our behalf

2000
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:39,540
you never know

2001
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:41,540
I've read the science fiction novel

2002
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:43,540
where the computer in the end

2003
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:45,540
organized the revolution

2004
01:19:47,540 --> 01:19:49,540
but

2005
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:51,540
let me give you an example

2006
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,540
today you have

2007
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:55,540
millions of people

2008
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:57,540
who are being exploited

2009
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,540
by public utility companies

2010
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:01,540
being privatized

2011
01:20:01,540 --> 01:20:03,540
and which are financialized

2012
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,540
and they have already

2013
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:07,540
sold to financiers

2014
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:09,540
the next 20 years

2015
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:11,540
of the electricity bills that you will be paying

2016
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:13,540
and as a result

2017
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:15,540
of this financialization

2018
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:17,540
your bill is going up and up and up

2019
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:19,540
completely disproportionately to the cost

2020
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:21,540
of producing electricity, water, whatever

2021
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:23,540
what if

2022
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:25,540
we could work out

2023
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:27,540
which financial derivatives

2024
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:29,540
or CDOs

2025
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:33,540
are packaging

2026
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,540
the bills in a particular neighborhood

2027
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,540
and another neighborhood

2028
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:39,540
and we organize through the internet

2029
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:41,540
so that we can have

2030
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,540
an electricity bill payment strike

2031
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:45,540
that is timed in such a way

2032
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:47,540
as to explode those CDOs

2033
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:49,540
and make them bankrupt

2034
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:51,540
now that's a form of collective action

2035
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:53,540
which is using the financial instruments

2036
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:55,540
of

2037
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:57,540
this kind of network

2038
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:59,540
against it

2039
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:01,540
we need to think beyond

2040
01:21:01,540 --> 01:21:03,540
modern times Charlie Chaplin

2041
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:05,540
thank you very much

2042
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:07,540
very interesting stuff

2043
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:09,540
Kelly Spetta

2044
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:11,540
that's all the Greek I know

2045
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:13,540
so

2046
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:15,540
I originally

2047
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:17,540
tried to do a PhD on

2048
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,540
the topic you talked

2049
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:21,540
about the separation between

2050
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:23,540
political power and economic power

2051
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:25,540
specifically about the European Union

2052
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:27,540
and how it sort of formalized

2053
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:29,540
this split between the political spheres

2054
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:31,540
no longer has to do anything

2055
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:33,540
with what the people want

2056
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,540
with the economic organization

2057
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:37,540
no one wanted to touch that one with the 10 foot pole

2058
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:39,540
so I'm doing something else now

2059
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:41,540
but it made my passion

2060
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:43,540
but to keep the question reasonably short

2061
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:45,540
what is the one change

2062
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,540
one of the many changes you'd like to see

2063
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:49,540
in the structure of the European Union

2064
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:51,540
that could address this

2065
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:53,540
right well

2066
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:55,540
I'll be very

2067
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:57,540
brief in my response

2068
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:59,540
we need to federate

2069
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:01,540
because there are only two choices here

2070
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:03,540
either we break it up

2071
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:05,540
which many people want

2072
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:07,540
even on the left

2073
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:09,540
thinking that

2074
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:11,540
recoiling into the bosom of the nation state

2075
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:13,540
is somehow going to allow them

2076
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:15,540
to create socialism in one country

2077
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:17,540
yeah right

2078
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:19,540
yeah

2079
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:21,540
but you have to create

2080
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,540
a democratic union

2081
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,540
now the problem is

2082
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,540
that with this crisis

2083
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:29,540
that we have which is both

2084
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:31,540
economic and political

2085
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:33,540
and moral if you want

2086
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:35,540
we can't have a serious discussion

2087
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:37,540
about federation

2088
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:39,540
because we have centrifugal forces

2089
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:41,540
that are pulling us apart

2090
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,540
so this is why our movement

2091
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:45,540
you may have heard of a movement

2092
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:47,540
that I'm part of, DM25

2093
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:49,540
proposing what we call a European New Deal

2094
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:51,540
a new deal

2095
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:53,540
in order to stabilize

2096
01:22:53,540 --> 01:22:55,540
and bring hope back so that we can have a discussion

2097
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:57,540
on how to federate

2098
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,540
thank you very much

2099
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:01,540
I'm also going to ask

2100
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:03,540
a question about the European Union

2101
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:05,540
and about Greece

2102
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:07,540
and about

2103
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:09,540
the immigration problem

2104
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:11,540
which is all the more

2105
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:13,540
on everyone's mind

2106
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:15,540
because of everyone's

2107
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:17,540
because of what Trump has just done

2108
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:19,540
with wiping out

2109
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:21,540
the

2110
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:23,540
agreement

2111
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,540
on

2112
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:27,540
the Iranian

2113
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:29,540
nuclear situation

2114
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:31,540
I

2115
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:33,540
recently read

2116
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:35,540
that on the island of Lesbos

2117
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:37,540
I believe

2118
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,540
which is an island that receives

2119
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:41,540
a lot of the

2120
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:43,540
immigrants from the Middle East, Syria

2121
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:45,540
that Greeks

2122
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:47,540
were attacking

2123
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:49,540
the immigrants

2124
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:51,540
and I read

2125
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,540
that

2126
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:55,540
I have read

2127
01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:57,540
for years now that conditions

2128
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,540
in the camps are terrible

2129
01:23:59,540 --> 01:24:01,540
and something

2130
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:03,540
that I have wondered about

2131
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:05,540
for years is

2132
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,540
why is it

2133
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:09,540
the immigrants from

2134
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:11,540
the Middle East and North Africa

2135
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:13,540
coming to the south

2136
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:15,540
of Europe

2137
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:17,540
the poorest part of Europe

2138
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:19,540
and

2139
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:21,540
why is it that there is not

2140
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:23,540
some common effort

2141
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:25,540
perhaps this is a very naive question

2142
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:27,540
but some common effort

2143
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:29,540
to subsidize

2144
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:31,540
countries like Greece

2145
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:33,540
which is in

2146
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:35,540
terrible economic straits

2147
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:37,540
to deal

2148
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:39,540
more humanely

2149
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,540
with these people

2150
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:43,540
that's a fantastic question

2151
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:45,540
ok let's

2152
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:47,540
let me answer in three parts

2153
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:49,540
firstly inform you about what's going on in Lesbos

2154
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:51,540
because Lesbos is very

2155
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:53,540
dear to us

2156
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:55,540
as Greeks to our hearts

2157
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:57,540
and we are

2158
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:59,540
devastated by what's going on

2159
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:01,540
firstly let me be

2160
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:03,540
fair to the people of Lesbos

2161
01:25:03,540 --> 01:25:05,540
the vast majority of the people of Lesbos

2162
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:07,540
have been magnificent

2163
01:25:07,540 --> 01:25:09,540
for three years now

2164
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:11,540
it's an island that is very depressed

2165
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:13,540
financially economically

2166
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:15,540
it's a bit like Detroit

2167
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,540
and you have a million people

2168
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:19,540
it's an island of 17,000 people

2169
01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:21,540
and a million people came

2170
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:23,540
and most of them passed through

2171
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,540
now we have 50,000 left

2172
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:27,540
and they went on the shore

2173
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,540
they picked them up

2174
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:31,540
they opened their houses

2175
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:33,540
they opened their shops and gave them food

2176
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:35,540
of course for no money and so on

2177
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:37,540
but the vast majority

2178
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:39,540
of course when you have a combination

2179
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:41,540
of

2180
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:43,540
the great depression that we have

2181
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:45,540
in Greece you have Nazis

2182
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:47,540
and add to this

2183
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:49,540
the European Union's

2184
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:51,540
attitude

2185
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:53,540
which is effective to turn Lesbos into a concentration camp

2186
01:25:53,540 --> 01:25:55,540
and the people of

2187
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:57,540
the Greeks who live there

2188
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:59,540
then become very susceptible

2189
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:01,540
to the toxic narrative of the Greek Nazis

2190
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:03,540
who say to them see

2191
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:05,540
these bastards came here

2192
01:26:05,540 --> 01:26:07,540
and now we are

2193
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:09,540
instead of being a beautiful Greek

2194
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,540
a Greek island receiving tourists

2195
01:26:11,540 --> 01:26:13,540
and doing well

2196
01:26:13,540 --> 01:26:15,540
we are ourselves part of a concentration camp

2197
01:26:15,540 --> 01:26:17,540
so it's very difficult to fight against this narrative

2198
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:19,540
but

2199
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:21,540
to tell you what I think

2200
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:23,540
so

2201
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:25,540
the situation on the ground

2202
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:27,540
there are three camps

2203
01:26:27,540 --> 01:26:29,540
one is called Moria

2204
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:31,540
it is the most notorious one

2205
01:26:31,540 --> 01:26:33,540
a camp that can hold

2206
01:26:33,540 --> 01:26:35,540
under reasonable conditions

2207
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:37,540
not good but the reasonable

2208
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,540
2,000 people there are 10,000 people

2209
01:26:39,540 --> 01:26:41,540
so they live in

2210
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:43,540
circumstances that do not

2211
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:45,540
be fit a civilized

2212
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,540
part of the world

2213
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:49,540
but that's on purpose

2214
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:51,540
it is run by the European Union

2215
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,540
and the United Nations

2216
01:26:53,540 --> 01:26:55,540
and it is

2217
01:26:55,540 --> 01:26:57,540
accessible of misery

2218
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:59,540
on purpose

2219
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:01,540
from coming

2220
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:03,540
there are another two camps

2221
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:05,540
that local NGOs have created

2222
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:07,540
and they are magnificent

2223
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:09,540
they are absolutely magnificent

2224
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:11,540
if you look at the circumstances

2225
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:13,540
in there

2226
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:15,540
the problem they have

2227
01:27:15,540 --> 01:27:17,540
is that they don't have much capacity

2228
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:19,540
so there are 300 families in one

2229
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:21,540
and 110 families in the other

2230
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,540
but they live

2231
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:25,540
it's actually quite heartwarming to see

2232
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,540
of course the problem is

2233
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:29,540
that none of these people

2234
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:31,540
have any kind of

2235
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:33,540
guarantee

2236
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,540
of safety

2237
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:37,540
I was talking to activists in the good camps

2238
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:39,540
who

2239
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:41,540
educate them

2240
01:27:41,540 --> 01:27:43,540
teach them English

2241
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:45,540
their own language because they have kids

2242
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:47,540
who speak Farsi

2243
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:49,540
Persian

2244
01:27:49,540 --> 01:27:51,540
and they teach them computing

2245
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:53,540
and they put a lot of effort in it

2246
01:27:53,540 --> 01:27:55,540
and it's really heartwarming

2247
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:57,540
but they say to me

2248
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:59,540
do you know the tragedy

2249
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:01,540
of not knowing what's going to happen

2250
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:03,540
tomorrow morning because the police may come in

2251
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:05,540
grab one of them

2252
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:07,540
put them in chains throw them on the boat

2253
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:09,540
back to Turkey

2254
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:11,540
so you have no idea is this kid

2255
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:13,540
you have a 12 year old kid there

2256
01:28:13,540 --> 01:28:15,540
and his or her parents

2257
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,540
are they going to be with us for a week

2258
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:19,540
2 weeks

2259
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:21,540
6 months 2 years

2260
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:23,540
the refugees don't know

2261
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:25,540
their lives

2262
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:27,540
the activists don't know

2263
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:29,540
so what do you teach them

2264
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:31,540
you teach very differently if you teach somebody for 2 weeks

2265
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:33,540
compared to if you know you would be teaching them for 2 years

2266
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:35,540
the curriculum is different

2267
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:37,540
and the local community

2268
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:39,540
doesn't even know

2269
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:41,540
is this camp here going to be permanent

2270
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:43,540
are we going to assimilate them

2271
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:45,540
are we going to live with these people forever

2272
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:47,540
because the local community will react differently

2273
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:49,540
if they knew that

2274
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:51,540
and with some support from them

2275
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:53,540
and the worst part is

2276
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:55,540
that

2277
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:57,540
you know

2278
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:59,540
the reason why I left the ministry

2279
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:01,540
was because my party

2280
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:03,540
and my prime minister capitulated

2281
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:05,540
to the

2282
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:07,540
loan agreement

2283
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:09,540
but immediately after that capitulation

2284
01:29:09,540 --> 01:29:11,540
that's what usually happens

2285
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:13,540
if you capitulate on one big thing

2286
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:15,540
then you capitulate on everything

2287
01:29:15,540 --> 01:29:17,540
after that he also capitulated and signed

2288
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:19,540
the European Union Treaty with Turkey

2289
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:21,540
and a front

2290
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:23,540
to civilization

2291
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:25,540
because what we are doing is we are effectively

2292
01:29:25,540 --> 01:29:27,540
the west

2293
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:29,540
civilized Europe

2294
01:29:29,540 --> 01:29:31,540
we are bribing an increasingly

2295
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:33,540
dictatorial president of Turkey

2296
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:35,540
to the tune of some like 7 billion

2297
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:37,540
dollars

2298
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:39,540
so that he allows us

2299
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:41,540
to violate international law on refugees

2300
01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:43,540
you know according to international law of refugees

2301
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:45,540
refugees

2302
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:47,540
people coming to your country have the right

2303
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:49,540
by international law

2304
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:51,540
to a hearing

2305
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:53,540
that will determine whether they are political refugees

2306
01:29:53,540 --> 01:29:55,540
or not

2307
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:57,540
they don't have that right on lesbos

2308
01:29:57,540 --> 01:29:59,540
because

2309
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:01,540
the EU-Turkey treaty has deemed

2310
01:30:01,540 --> 01:30:03,540
that Turkey is a safe country

2311
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:05,540
so that

2312
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:07,540
when you arrive on lesbos

2313
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:09,540
you are not granted an interview

2314
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:11,540
as to whether you've been persecuted by the Syrian regime

2315
01:30:11,540 --> 01:30:13,540
by the Taliban

2316
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:15,540
by I don't know whom

2317
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:17,540
but if you are kept there

2318
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:19,540
for an indefinite period

2319
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:21,540
you are not allowed to go to the rest of Greece

2320
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:23,540
you can wander around like a lost soul in lesbos

2321
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:25,540
but of course you live in the camp

2322
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:27,540
because there is nowhere else to live

2323
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:29,540
where are you going to live on the beach

2324
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:31,540
so it's

2325
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:33,540
purely horrible but

2326
01:30:33,540 --> 01:30:35,540
let's just

2327
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:37,540
take a broader look at that situation

2328
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:39,540
you said the immigration problem

2329
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:41,540
I don't see that why

2330
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:43,540
that immigration is a problem

2331
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:45,540
but it's a great asset

2332
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:47,540
from a European perspective

2333
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:49,540
for a thousand years

2334
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:51,540
we have been populating the earth

2335
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:53,540
we're Europeans

2336
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:55,540
we've been sending our ships

2337
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:57,540
and our caravans

2338
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:59,540
to the Americas

2339
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:01,540
to Australia, to New Zealand

2340
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:03,540
we destroyed all the indigenous people in the world

2341
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:05,540
in Africa we colonized

2342
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:07,540
we created the new world

2343
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:09,540
that's what we did

2344
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:11,540
and we thought it was alright

2345
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:13,540
but we're aging

2346
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:15,540
we're becoming a sad aged lot

2347
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:17,540
yeah

2348
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:19,540
and the demographic dynamics

2349
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:21,540
are reversing

2350
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:23,540
and we need these people

2351
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:25,540
we really need these people

2352
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:27,540
Germany is being depleted

2353
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:29,540
it's becoming another Japan

2354
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:31,540
Greece too, we have an economic crisis as well

2355
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:33,540
you know

2356
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:35,540
we are in a process of desertification

2357
01:31:35,540 --> 01:31:37,540
so we need these people

2358
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:39,540
instead of

2359
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:41,540
treating migration

2360
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:43,540
immigration as an asset

2361
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:45,540
that we must collectively

2362
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:47,540
manage

2363
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:49,540
and find ways

2364
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:51,540
of making it work for us Europeans

2365
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,540
we are looking at it as a threat

2366
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:55,540
and we are trying to imagine

2367
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:57,540
a huge wall

2368
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:59,540
Trump-like

2369
01:31:59,540 --> 01:32:01,540
going through the Mediterranean

2370
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,540
the North Pole, I don't know what they are going to do

2371
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:05,540
it's pathetic

2372
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:07,540
it's just a complete failure of the imagination

2373
01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:09,540
and the result of course is

2374
01:32:09,540 --> 01:32:11,540
that the builder

2375
01:32:11,540 --> 01:32:13,540
the taller

2376
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:15,540
and more

2377
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,540
impenderable the wall that we create

2378
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:19,540
the only thing that changes

2379
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:21,540
is more deaths

2380
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:23,540
and greater profits for the traffickers

2381
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:25,540
it doesn't stop immigration

2382
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,540
all it does it creates insecurity

2383
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:29,540
both in the local population

2384
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:31,540
and in the migrant population

2385
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:33,540
and profits for the traffickers

2386
01:32:33,540 --> 01:32:35,540
so

2387
01:32:35,540 --> 01:32:37,540
let them in

2388
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:41,540
and impose minimum wages

2389
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:43,540
living wages

2390
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:45,540
in the countries of their origin

2391
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:47,540
and if the countries cannot provide them

2392
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:49,540
help them provide them

2393
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:51,540
that's the solution

2394
01:32:51,540 --> 01:32:53,540
not walls

2395
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:55,540
I can't help but notice

2396
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:57,540
that we are talking about the continuum of capitalism

2397
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:59,540
while we overlook a graveyard

2398
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:03,540
my understanding

2399
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:05,540
but one might be wrong

2400
01:33:05,540 --> 01:33:07,540
is that we are paying approximately

2401
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:09,540
8 trillion dollars for the wars

2402
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:11,540
in interest

2403
01:33:11,540 --> 01:33:13,540
for the wars?

2404
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:15,540
for the wars US

2405
01:33:15,540 --> 01:33:17,540
how does an economy

2406
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:19,540
overcome that

2407
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:21,540
and how does that play out

2408
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:23,540
8 trillion in interest

2409
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:25,540
per year

2410
01:33:25,540 --> 01:33:27,540
it's not 8 trillion per year

2411
01:33:27,540 --> 01:33:29,540
it's not

2412
01:33:29,540 --> 01:33:31,540
no

2413
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:33,540
but what is your general concern

2414
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:35,540
that we pay too much for what

2415
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:37,540
for the dead

2416
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:39,540
no, I'm talking about the wars, just the wars

2417
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:41,540
let me tell you

2418
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:43,540
maybe it's 8 billion but not 8 trillion

2419
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:45,540
ok, then my figures are wrong

2420
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:47,540
3 misers is ok

2421
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:55,540
the United States of America

2422
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:57,540
as Eisenhower told you in the 1950s

2423
01:33:57,540 --> 01:33:59,540
and warned you

2424
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:01,540
but a very interesting industrial policy

2425
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:05,540
you don't have a formal industrial policy

2426
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:07,540
you have something called the military industrial complex

2427
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:09,540
and the military industrial complex

2428
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:11,540
is essential for American capitalism

2429
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:13,540
in the way that the American capitalism

2430
01:34:13,540 --> 01:34:15,540
has been created

2431
01:34:15,540 --> 01:34:17,540
so

2432
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:19,540
the reason why

2433
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:21,540
Missouri

2434
01:34:21,540 --> 01:34:23,540
and Massachusetts can be in the same union

2435
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:25,540
and you don't have the same problems that we have

2436
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:27,540
between Greece and Germany

2437
01:34:27,540 --> 01:34:29,540
it's because you have

2438
01:34:29,540 --> 01:34:31,540
what I call a surplus recycling mechanism

2439
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:33,540
you have food stamps

2440
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:35,540
you have social security

2441
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:37,540
and that means that money

2442
01:34:37,540 --> 01:34:39,540
that is taxed in the surplus

2443
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:41,540
states is transferred

2444
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:43,540
to the deficit states and that keeps

2445
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:45,540
a degree of balance

2446
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:47,540
but the most important part of your surplus

2447
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:49,540
recycling mechanism

2448
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:51,540
is in the military industrial complex

2449
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:53,540
so when Boeing gets a contract

2450
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:55,540
to build the new generation of fighter jets

2451
01:34:55,540 --> 01:34:57,540
quadrillions

2452
01:34:59,540 --> 01:35:01,540
the Pentagon says to them

2453
01:35:01,540 --> 01:35:03,540
but you're going to have to build the engine

2454
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:05,540
in a new site in Missouri

2455
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:07,540
in the deficit places

2456
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:09,540
the spare parts of this and that

2457
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:11,540
over there and so on

2458
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:13,540
so

2459
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:15,540
to keep this going you need some wars

2460
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:19,540
I'm not proposing that this is how it should be

2461
01:35:19,540 --> 01:35:21,540
I'm just describing it

2462
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:23,540
so in 1991

2463
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:25,540
the Pentagon

2464
01:35:25,540 --> 01:35:27,540
and the Treasury Department

2465
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:29,540
had a major

2466
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:31,540
major headache

2467
01:35:31,540 --> 01:35:33,540
the Cold War had finished

2468
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:35,540
so they could no longer pass through Congress

2469
01:35:35,540 --> 01:35:37,540
on the basis of national security

2470
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:39,540
the bills that were necessary

2471
01:35:39,540 --> 01:35:41,540
in order to keep replenishing

2472
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:43,540
the cruise and pressing missiles

2473
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:45,540
so they had to clear the stock

2474
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:47,540
so you had the first war in Iraq

2475
01:35:47,540 --> 01:35:49,540
and remember

2476
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:51,540
the war had finished

2477
01:35:51,540 --> 01:35:53,540
they were going into the middle of the desert

2478
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:55,540
finding all the cruise and pressing missiles

2479
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:57,540
to get rid of them

2480
01:35:57,540 --> 01:35:59,540
so that they could order new ones

2481
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:01,540
so capitalism is just

2482
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:03,540
a very rational system

2483
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:05,540
because

2484
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:07,540
it's a very simple reason why it's so irrational

2485
01:36:07,540 --> 01:36:09,540
because it has a productive capacity

2486
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:11,540
a capacity to produce

2487
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:13,540
which far exceeds

2488
01:36:13,540 --> 01:36:15,540
its capacity to consume

2489
01:36:15,540 --> 01:36:17,540
so something has to make up this difference

2490
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:19,540
and war is a result

2491
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:21,540
not just lack of democracy

2492
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:23,540
Hi, thank you for tonight

2493
01:36:23,540 --> 01:36:25,540
question for you

2494
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:27,540
if we

2495
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:29,540
theoretically go back to 2015

2496
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:31,540
you're now in charge instead of

2497
01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:33,540
Cyprus, in charge of Greece

2498
01:36:33,540 --> 01:36:35,540
faced with harsh austerity versus Grexit

2499
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:37,540
what political path would you have chosen?

2500
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:39,540
You know the answer

2501
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:41,540
that's why I'm here, I'm not in the ministry

2502
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:45,540
why am I not in the ministry

2503
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,540
why did I resign

2504
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:49,540
we had an agreement

2505
01:36:49,540 --> 01:36:51,540
we had a very simple agreement

2506
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:53,540
and this is the only reason why I accepted the finance ministry

2507
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:55,540
and to run in the election

2508
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,540
we had an agreement that there were three possible outcomes

2509
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:59,540
I'll put it succinctly

2510
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:01,540
three possible outcomes

2511
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:03,540
one was

2512
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:05,540
continuing debt bondage

2513
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:07,540
in the euro

2514
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:09,540
which is what has been happening since 2010

2515
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:11,540
for me that was the worst possible outcome

2516
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:13,540
another outcome was Grexit

2517
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:15,540
for Greece to be chucked out of the eurozone

2518
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:17,540
or to choose to get out

2519
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:19,540
this came

2520
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:21,540
with substantial costs

2521
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:23,540
and it was never my proposal

2522
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:25,540
but I always considered it to be better

2523
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:27,540
than perpetual debt bondage in the euro

2524
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:29,540
when people say but the euro is a strong currency

2525
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:31,540
I say if you're a pauper

2526
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:33,540
and you live under a bridge in New York

2527
01:37:33,540 --> 01:37:35,540
you have one dollar in your pocket

2528
01:37:35,540 --> 01:37:37,540
it doesn't mean you have a strong currency

2529
01:37:37,540 --> 01:37:39,540
you have one bloody dollar in your pocket

2530
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:41,540
it doesn't help much

2531
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:43,540
and then

2532
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:45,540
the first best

2533
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:47,540
my

2534
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:49,540
ideal solution

2535
01:37:49,540 --> 01:37:51,540
would be

2536
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:53,540
debt restructuring within the euro

2537
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:55,540
that would allow us to stay in the euro in a sustainable way

2538
01:37:55,540 --> 01:37:57,540
and to end the great depression

2539
01:37:57,540 --> 01:37:59,540
so the point I was making was

2540
01:37:59,540 --> 01:38:01,540
no bluffing

2541
01:38:01,540 --> 01:38:03,540
we say to them we don't want to get out of the euro

2542
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:05,540
but we need a debt restructure

2543
01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:07,540
and we need the end of austerity

2544
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:09,540
for Greece to remain

2545
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:11,540
sustainable within the euro

2546
01:38:11,540 --> 01:38:13,540
and let's sit down and we'll compromise

2547
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:15,540
I did say to Obama

2548
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:17,540
when he said you have to compromise

2549
01:38:17,540 --> 01:38:19,540
I compromised

2550
01:38:19,540 --> 01:38:21,540
I dream of compromise

2551
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:23,540
but I'm never going to be

2552
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:25,540
compromised

2553
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:27,540
there is a fundamental difference between the two

2554
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:29,540
ok

2555
01:38:29,540 --> 01:38:31,540
and we say to them

2556
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:33,540
we are not going to accept that

2557
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:35,540
we are not putting our signature on another loan agreement

2558
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:37,540
that extends and pretends

2559
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:39,540
our bankruptcy into the future

2560
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:41,540
shoot us, kill us, get us out of the euro

2561
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:43,540
we don't want to get out of the euro

2562
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:45,540
but we consider getting out of the euro to be

2563
01:38:45,540 --> 01:38:47,540
a lesser evil

2564
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:49,540
than staying under the conditions of debt

2565
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:51,540
so Cyprus supposedly agreed with me

2566
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:53,540
and not only agreed with me but considered to be more

2567
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:55,540
right-wing than him

2568
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:57,540
and more ready to compromise

2569
01:38:57,540 --> 01:38:59,540
and he had some reasons

2570
01:38:59,540 --> 01:39:01,540
not that he was right

2571
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:03,540
but

2572
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:05,540
you'll be very

2573
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:07,540
interested to hear that

2574
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:09,540
but one of the people that worked with me

2575
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:11,540
during this period in creating

2576
01:39:11,540 --> 01:39:13,540
the plan and the narrative against

2577
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:15,540
the Troika and the International Monetary Fund

2578
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:17,540
was somebody called Larry Summers

2579
01:39:17,540 --> 01:39:19,540
who was actually very good

2580
01:39:19,540 --> 01:39:21,540
because he understood that what was happening in Greece

2581
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:23,540
reflected

2582
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:25,540
very quickly and immediately in the European

2583
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:27,540
macroeconomic stance

2584
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:29,540
which was detrimental to the interests of the United States

2585
01:39:29,540 --> 01:39:31,540
so we worked together

2586
01:39:31,540 --> 01:39:33,540
with Larry Summers

2587
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:35,540
and when we met I said

2588
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:37,540
I'm very glad you haven't read my last book

2589
01:39:37,540 --> 01:39:39,540
and he said

2590
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:41,540
why? I said because

2591
01:39:41,540 --> 01:39:43,540
I referred to it to you

2592
01:39:43,540 --> 01:39:45,540
on a number of occasions in the same book

2593
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:47,540
as the prince of darkness

2594
01:39:47,540 --> 01:39:49,540
and he said

2595
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:51,540
well at least you called me prince

2596
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:53,540
I've been called worse

2597
01:39:53,540 --> 01:39:55,540
so it's clear

2598
01:39:55,540 --> 01:39:57,540
the two organizations

2599
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:59,540
I like to follow side by side

2600
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:01,540
the DM25 movement

2601
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:03,540
and six degrees of citizen space

2602
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:05,540
in Canada

2603
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:07,540
with John Rouse and Saul

2604
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:09,540
and I just really enjoyed John Rouse and Saul's book

2605
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:11,540
The Collapse of Globalism

2606
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:13,540
and he describes this idea

2607
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:15,540
of a positive form of nationalism

2608
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:17,540
that we haven't explored

2609
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:19,540
we think of nationalism as negative

2610
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:21,540
and we often only see negative forms

2611
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:23,540
based on exclusion

2612
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:25,540
but our movements like

2613
01:40:25,540 --> 01:40:27,540
DM25

2614
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:29,540
imagining

2615
01:40:29,540 --> 01:40:31,540
and exploring possibly

2616
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:33,540
hijacking and displacing hate

2617
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:35,540
with positive forms of nationalism

2618
01:40:35,540 --> 01:40:37,540
that are centered around

2619
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:39,540
inclusion

2620
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:41,540
and

2621
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:43,540
sort of collective missions

2622
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:45,540
like reducing inequality

2623
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:47,540
that can capture a lot of the people

2624
01:40:47,540 --> 01:40:49,540
that are displaced in this country

2625
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:51,540
the Trump voters that might not be racist

2626
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:53,540
that just wanted a better deal

2627
01:40:53,540 --> 01:40:55,540
and they really fall in with the flag

2628
01:40:55,540 --> 01:40:57,540
when someone waves the flag

2629
01:40:57,540 --> 01:40:59,540
they're easy to be manipulated

2630
01:40:59,540 --> 01:41:01,540
but they just feel that they must go with it

2631
01:41:01,540 --> 01:41:03,540
but now in this country

2632
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:05,540
when you see two American flags

2633
01:41:05,540 --> 01:41:07,540
on the back of a pickup truck

2634
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:09,540
that's kind of a hate symbol

2635
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:11,540
the left progressive people

2636
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:13,540
that enjoy inclusion

2637
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:15,540
have maybe allowed

2638
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:17,540
the flag to get stolen from them

2639
01:41:17,540 --> 01:41:19,540
but then at the same time

2640
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:21,540
we need to integrate nationalism

2641
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:23,540
possibly a new form

2642
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:25,540
with ideas like a federation

2643
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:27,540
to gain more power

2644
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:29,540
back into

2645
01:41:29,540 --> 01:41:31,540
the political sphere

2646
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:33,540
against the financial sphere

2647
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:35,540
Well, let me say that

2648
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:37,540
I get your drift

2649
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:41,540
I grew up in a culture

2650
01:41:41,540 --> 01:41:43,540
where the left

2651
01:41:45,540 --> 01:41:47,540
answered this question of yours

2652
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:49,540
a long time ago

2653
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:51,540
by making a distinction

2654
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:53,540
not between positive and negative

2655
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:55,540
but between patriotism

2656
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:57,540
a line was always

2657
01:41:57,540 --> 01:41:59,540
we're patriots

2658
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:01,540
and the difference between a patriot and a nationalist

2659
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:03,540
the patriot loves his country

2660
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:05,540
and the nationalist thinks that his country

2661
01:42:05,540 --> 01:42:07,540
has the right to steamroll over every other country

2662
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:09,540
and I think that is a good way

2663
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:11,540
of resolving it

2664
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:13,540
and also by making this more

2665
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:15,540
contemporary

2666
01:42:15,540 --> 01:42:17,540
I think we have to

2667
01:42:17,540 --> 01:42:19,540
appropriate the

2668
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:21,540
slogan

2669
01:42:21,540 --> 01:42:23,540
we should take this

2670
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:25,540
I want my city back

2671
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:27,540
I want my neighborhood back

2672
01:42:27,540 --> 01:42:29,540
I want control over my city

2673
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:31,540
my municipality

2674
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:33,540
my state, my country

2675
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:35,540
but the only way to get my country back

2676
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:37,540
is if others get their country back

2677
01:42:37,540 --> 01:42:39,540
as well

2678
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:41,540
and if we all work together

2679
01:42:41,540 --> 01:42:43,540
and we understand that to get our country back

2680
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:45,540
we need to resolve problems such as

2681
01:42:45,540 --> 01:42:47,540
low quality jobs

2682
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:49,540
low levels of investments

2683
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:51,540
in the green transition

2684
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:53,540
that the planet needs

2685
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:55,540
climate change and so on

2686
01:42:55,540 --> 01:42:57,540
that we need to fight poverty

2687
01:42:57,540 --> 01:42:59,540
and it is impossible to fight poverty in one country

2688
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:01,540
when it's rising in other countries

2689
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:03,540
if you think that you can do that

2690
01:43:03,540 --> 01:43:05,540
you're deluding yourself

2691
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:07,540
so in effect

2692
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:09,540
to embed patriotism

2693
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:11,540
in a narrative which sees

2694
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:13,540
the major problems that society faces

2695
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:15,540
like poverty, low investment

2696
01:43:15,540 --> 01:43:17,540
problems with the health service and so on

2697
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:19,540
as we see climate change

2698
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:23,540
what I mean by that

2699
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:25,540
is climate change requires local action

2700
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:27,540
that we do things here

2701
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:29,540
in Boston, that we do things in Massachusetts

2702
01:43:29,540 --> 01:43:31,540
in the United States but we have to act globally

2703
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:33,540
as well

2704
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:35,540
and we need to cooperate

2705
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:37,540
because resolving poverty as I said

2706
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:39,540
can only happen at

2707
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,540
the Bretton Woods system is a good example

2708
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:43,540
poverty fell everywhere

2709
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:45,540
throughout the global system

2710
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:47,540
inequality shrunk everywhere

2711
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:49,540
it couldn't rise in one place massively

2712
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:51,540
and fall in another

2713
01:43:51,540 --> 01:43:53,540
so we have to combine

2714
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:55,540
level of country, of neighborhoods

2715
01:43:55,540 --> 01:43:57,540
of community, patriotism

2716
01:43:57,540 --> 01:43:59,540
with transnationalism and internationalism

2717
01:43:59,540 --> 01:44:01,540
that allows us to claim

2718
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:03,540
our own countries back

2719
01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:05,540
a funny multinational question

2720
01:44:05,540 --> 01:44:07,540
that I would love to hear answered from you

2721
01:44:07,540 --> 01:44:09,540
in the book

2722
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:11,540
John Rouse and Saul describes this concept

2723
01:44:11,540 --> 01:44:13,540
where a lot of the trade

2724
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:15,540
we have is fictitious

2725
01:44:15,540 --> 01:44:17,540
it is multinationals trading with themselves

2726
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:19,540
yeah of course

2727
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:21,540
and

2728
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:23,540
it's called limit pricing

2729
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:25,540
well now you know we were just

2730
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:27,540
creating these tariffs

2731
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:29,540
that might not really get to the root

2732
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:31,540
of the issue we were punishing multinationals

2733
01:44:31,540 --> 01:44:33,540
we weren't punishing another nation

2734
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:35,540
we were punishing multinationals

2735
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:37,540
that straddle to nations

2736
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:39,540
and that not a lot of people in this country

2737
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:41,540
know how to think of these concepts

2738
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:43,540
well I have a better way

2739
01:44:43,540 --> 01:44:45,540
of punishing the multinationals

2740
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:47,540
how about making the IRS do its job

2741
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:49,540
because if you

2742
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:51,540
go to

2743
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:53,540
Venezuela, or by the example

2744
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:55,540
if you go to Italy and make some money

2745
01:44:55,540 --> 01:44:57,540
you get taxed here

2746
01:44:57,540 --> 01:44:59,540
you are taxed by the IRS

2747
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:01,540
on your global income

2748
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:03,540
you cannot say

2749
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:05,540
I made $10,000 in

2750
01:45:05,540 --> 01:45:07,540
Napoli and therefore

2751
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:09,540
none of your business

2752
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:11,540
you get taxed on your global income

2753
01:45:11,540 --> 01:45:13,540
unless you are a corporation

2754
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:15,540
and then you don't get taxed at all

2755
01:45:15,540 --> 01:45:17,540
for the money you stash away

2756
01:45:17,540 --> 01:45:19,540
all over the world

2757
01:45:19,540 --> 01:45:21,540
how about having the IRS do its job

2758
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:23,540
instead of introducing

2759
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:25,540
tariffs that in the end

2760
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:27,540
have a detrimental effect on all of us

2761
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:29,540
but the IRS can't

2762
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:31,540
yes it can

2763
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:33,540
yes of course it can

2764
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:35,540
they need their marching orders

2765
01:45:35,540 --> 01:45:37,540
from congress

2766
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:39,540
they need the politicians to say to them

2767
01:45:39,540 --> 01:45:41,540
you are going to treat

2768
01:45:41,540 --> 01:45:43,540
look, the supreme court

2769
01:45:43,540 --> 01:45:45,540
in its infinite idiocy

2770
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:47,540
decided that corporations and human

2771
01:45:47,540 --> 01:45:49,540
beings and individuals will be treated the same

2772
01:45:49,540 --> 01:45:51,540
when it comes to super PACs and all that

2773
01:45:51,540 --> 01:45:53,540
why not treat

2774
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:55,540
also decide that

2775
01:45:55,540 --> 01:45:57,540
corporations and individuals will be treated the same

2776
01:45:57,540 --> 01:45:59,540
tax wise

2777
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:01,540
I remember a beautiful

2778
01:46:01,540 --> 01:46:03,540
poster I saw in Texas saying that

2779
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:05,540
I like it

2780
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:07,540
I believe that corporations

2781
01:46:07,540 --> 01:46:09,540
have human rights

2782
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:11,540
when I see one of them being hanged

2783
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:15,540
that was Texas for you

2784
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:17,540
in the

2785
01:46:17,540 --> 01:46:19,540
briefest and broadest of strokes

2786
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:21,540
in the post-capitalistic world

2787
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:23,540
that you envision

2788
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:25,540
what does the credit system look like

2789
01:46:25,540 --> 01:46:27,540
and how does it achieve equilibrium

2790
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:29,540
with the sovereignty of states

2791
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:31,540
ok how long do we have

2792
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:33,540
no but

2793
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:35,540
let me put it simply

2794
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:39,540
if we have a system

2795
01:46:39,540 --> 01:46:41,540
where private

2796
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:43,540
property

2797
01:46:43,540 --> 01:46:45,540
is maintained over

2798
01:46:45,540 --> 01:46:47,540
goods and services

2799
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:49,540
and things that give you happiness

2800
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:51,540
but not over

2801
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:53,540
productive processes

2802
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:55,540
and productive processes belong

2803
01:46:55,540 --> 01:46:57,540
to those that work them

2804
01:46:57,540 --> 01:46:59,540
that are part of it

2805
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:01,540
then you simply

2806
01:47:01,540 --> 01:47:03,540
have a credit system

2807
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:05,540
you don't need one at all

2808
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:11,540
your justification for that is

2809
01:47:11,540 --> 01:47:13,540
that credit is only necessary

2810
01:47:13,540 --> 01:47:15,540
when you've got an asymmetrical distribution

2811
01:47:15,540 --> 01:47:17,540
of property rights

2812
01:47:17,540 --> 01:47:19,540
over means of production

2813
01:47:19,540 --> 01:47:21,540
if you and I have a cooperative

2814
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:23,540
if we own a business together

2815
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:25,540
we have a partnership

2816
01:47:25,540 --> 01:47:27,540
then I'm never going to be in your debt

2817
01:47:27,540 --> 01:47:29,540
or you admire that

2818
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:31,540
we're producing together

2819
01:47:31,540 --> 01:47:33,540
and we're going to be sharing the profits

2820
01:47:33,540 --> 01:47:35,540
that we make

2821
01:47:35,540 --> 01:47:37,540
what about investors

2822
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:39,540
well there would be no investors

2823
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:41,540
what about the other person

2824
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:43,540
because investors exist only because

2825
01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:45,540
you have an asymmetrical distribution

2826
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:47,540
of wealth

2827
01:47:47,540 --> 01:47:49,540
if you didn't have asymmetrical distribution

2828
01:47:49,540 --> 01:47:51,540
but look this is going to be the topic of my next book

2829
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:53,540
I have not written it yet

2830
01:47:53,540 --> 01:47:55,540
so I'll see you in 3 years

2831
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:01,540
ευχαριστώ
