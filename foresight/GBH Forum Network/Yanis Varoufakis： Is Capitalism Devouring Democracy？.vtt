00:00.000 --> 00:02.180
Θα μπορούσα να δούμε τον Γερματικό Φινένσμι,

00:02.180 --> 00:09.380
ότι είχε εξαναγωγήσει με δυνατές που έφεραν σαν λασσοπίδια.

00:09.880 --> 00:12.260
Και έφεραν το παιδί και είχε πει,

00:12.260 --> 00:14.440
«Αυτή η σημερινή, η σημερινή,

00:14.440 --> 00:16.240
η οποία θα εξαναγωγήσω εσύ».

00:18.240 --> 00:22.540
Οι εξαναγωγήσεις δεν μπορούν να αλλάξουν την οικονομική πολιτισμία.

00:23.540 --> 00:28.540
Οι εξαναγωγήσεις δεν μπορούσαν να εξαναγωγήσουν την οικονομική πολιτισμία.

00:29.540 --> 00:31.540
Έχω εξαναγωγήσει.

00:31.540 --> 00:33.540
Η εξαναγωγήση μου ήταν,

00:33.540 --> 00:36.540
«Αυτή η εξαναγωγήση για την κίνηση της Κίνησης,

00:36.540 --> 00:38.540
γιατί they believed that too».

00:39.540 --> 00:41.540
Και έγιναν με την προποσία,

00:41.540 --> 00:43.540
αυτό είναι το reason why they hated me,

00:43.540 --> 00:45.540
was to be very moderate and said,

00:45.540 --> 00:49.540
«In that case, Wolfgang, let's ban elections,

00:49.540 --> 00:51.540
in bankrupt countries.

00:51.540 --> 00:55.540
Let's come out and declare that in the European Union

00:55.540 --> 00:59.540
you can only have democracy if you are a creditor country.

00:59.540 --> 01:01.540
If you are a debtor country, no democracy,

01:01.540 --> 01:04.540
elections cannot be allowed to change anything,

01:04.540 --> 01:07.540
because we have a loan agreement.

01:07.540 --> 01:08.540
We have a debtor's prison.

01:08.540 --> 01:10.540
Let's put Greece in the workhouse.

01:10.540 --> 01:11.540
I didn't say all these things,

01:11.540 --> 01:14.540
but I did say the thing about the Chinese Communist Party.

01:15.540 --> 01:18.540
«Αν εξαναγωγήσει την κίνηση της Κίνησης,

01:18.540 --> 01:21.540
γιατί they believed that if you are not able

01:21.540 --> 01:23.540
to explain the economy in a language

01:23.540 --> 01:25.540
which young people can understand,

01:25.540 --> 01:28.540
then you are clueless yourself.

01:28.540 --> 01:31.540
This from its author, Yanos Varifakis,

01:31.540 --> 01:35.540
a man not only known not to mince his words,

01:35.540 --> 01:39.540
but one who, in fact, wrote the book in Greek in nine days.

01:41.540 --> 01:43.540
I'm Mary Stath, the director of Cambridge Forum

01:43.540 --> 01:45.540
and tonight to assist us in navigating

01:45.540 --> 01:47.540
the murky waters of capitalism,

01:47.540 --> 01:49.540
and to quote Yanos,

01:49.540 --> 01:53.540
«Come to terms with the beast that dominates our lives.

01:53.540 --> 01:55.540
We are privileged to have the best of teachers,

01:55.540 --> 01:58.540
a philosopher and international economist,

01:58.540 --> 02:01.540
Varis Varifakis.»

02:01.540 --> 02:03.540
I'm very much looking forward to the conversation

02:03.540 --> 02:04.540
that we're going to have.

02:04.540 --> 02:06.540
But I've been asked to give a presentation,

02:06.540 --> 02:09.540
so I will, because sometimes I like to do,

02:09.540 --> 02:12.540
as I'm told, not very often.

02:12.540 --> 02:15.540
The title that has been advertised

02:15.540 --> 02:18.540
and some of you saw it outside and walked in,

02:18.540 --> 02:21.540
so I might as well honour the title,

02:21.540 --> 02:23.540
is a question.

02:23.540 --> 02:26.540
Is Capitalism Devouring Democracy?

02:26.540 --> 02:29.540
Allow me to begin with a slightly different question.

02:29.540 --> 02:32.540
Have you noticed how in the last few decades

02:32.540 --> 02:35.540
the quality of politicians has stumbled?

02:35.540 --> 02:38.540
Not just in this country, everywhere.

02:38.540 --> 02:42.540
For God's sake, even I became a politician in 2015.

02:42.540 --> 02:46.540
No, but seriously,

02:46.540 --> 02:49.540
there is a marked diminution

02:49.540 --> 02:53.540
in the rhetoric, in the capacity of politicians

02:53.540 --> 02:57.540
to inspire and indeed in the power that they have.

02:57.540 --> 03:01.540
Now, I don't believe that this is due to

03:01.540 --> 03:05.540
a degeneration of the DNA of humanity

03:05.540 --> 03:09.540
or of those who are interested in politics.

03:09.540 --> 03:11.540
What we have been observing

03:11.540 --> 03:14.540
is the shrinking of what I shall refer to

03:14.540 --> 03:17.540
as the political sphere.

03:17.540 --> 03:20.540
There used to be a time before capitalism

03:20.540 --> 03:24.540
when there was one sphere, the sphere of power.

03:24.540 --> 03:26.540
It was impossible to separate economic power

03:26.540 --> 03:28.540
from political power.

03:28.540 --> 03:33.540
The king had both military power,

03:33.540 --> 03:37.540
military power, produced political power

03:37.540 --> 03:39.540
and political power and economic power

03:39.540 --> 03:41.540
were one and the same thing.

03:41.540 --> 03:43.540
There is no great mystery really

03:43.540 --> 03:47.540
as to why there was no economics 150 years ago.

03:47.540 --> 03:49.540
The thing about Harvard University

03:49.540 --> 03:51.540
did not have an economics department

03:51.540 --> 03:53.540
in the 19th century, why?

03:53.540 --> 03:55.540
Because there was no need for it

03:55.540 --> 03:57.540
before capitalism came of age.

03:57.540 --> 03:59.540
Before capitalism, the political and economic sphere

03:59.540 --> 04:01.540
were one.

04:01.540 --> 04:03.540
There were closures in Britain

04:03.540 --> 04:06.540
that you had a remarkable transformation of society,

04:06.540 --> 04:09.540
that great transformation.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.540
The shifting from feudalism to capitalism.

04:11.540 --> 04:15.540
Effectively, the peasants were evicted from the land,

04:15.540 --> 04:17.540
replaced by sheep,

04:17.540 --> 04:20.540
because of the international trade routes

04:20.540 --> 04:24.540
that were creating an international market for wool

04:24.540 --> 04:27.540
and some commodities like wool, like steel,

04:27.540 --> 04:31.540
like spices and so on

04:31.540 --> 04:33.540
were emerging as international commodities

04:33.540 --> 04:35.540
with prices that were determined

04:35.540 --> 04:39.540
at the level of the international trade route system.

04:39.540 --> 04:43.540
All the other commodities were goods,

04:43.540 --> 04:46.540
were effectively sidelined.

04:46.540 --> 04:51.540
The lord of the land in Yorkshire

04:51.540 --> 04:55.540
or in Manchester had absolutely no incentive

04:55.540 --> 04:57.540
to retain those peasants

04:57.540 --> 05:02.540
planting idiotic little vegetables

05:02.540 --> 05:04.540
when they could just chuck them out of the land,

05:04.540 --> 05:06.540
replace them with fat sheep,

05:06.540 --> 05:10.540
whose wool suddenly had an international value,

05:10.540 --> 05:12.540
exchange value.

05:12.540 --> 05:15.540
But the enclosures created the working class.

05:15.540 --> 05:18.540
It created the commodification of labour.

05:18.540 --> 05:20.540
Up until then, people worked very hard,

05:20.540 --> 05:22.540
but they didn't sell their labour.

05:22.540 --> 05:26.540
We had a very interesting reversal

05:26.540 --> 05:32.540
of the timing of economic production and distribution.

05:32.540 --> 05:37.540
Under feudalism, we had work, production first.

05:37.540 --> 05:41.540
People actually toiled, they worked the land

05:41.540 --> 05:42.540
and they produced the harvest.

05:42.540 --> 05:44.540
Production came first.

05:44.540 --> 05:45.540
Then came distribution.

05:45.540 --> 05:48.540
The lord of the land or the miner or whatever

05:48.540 --> 05:50.540
would send the sheriff in

05:50.540 --> 05:54.540
and take his cut from the harvest.

05:54.540 --> 05:56.540
How much he would take

05:56.540 --> 05:58.540
and how much he would leave behind

05:58.540 --> 06:00.540
was a political issue.

06:00.540 --> 06:02.540
It had to do with military power.

06:02.540 --> 06:04.540
It had to do even with the benevolence of the lord.

06:04.540 --> 06:07.540
It had to do with the extent to which

06:07.540 --> 06:11.540
the lord needed to keep the peasants on side

06:11.540 --> 06:14.540
in case another lord tried to usurp

06:14.540 --> 06:16.540
his property rights over the land.

06:16.540 --> 06:19.540
It was a political, diplomatic, ethical,

06:19.540 --> 06:22.540
religious, economic process

06:22.540 --> 06:24.540
that determined distribution after production.

06:24.540 --> 06:29.540
Finally, the surplus that the lord amassed

06:29.540 --> 06:31.540
was sold in nearby markets

06:31.540 --> 06:34.540
and that created a financial surplus

06:34.540 --> 06:37.540
for the lord which then he lent out.

06:37.540 --> 06:40.540
We had production, distribution

06:40.540 --> 06:44.540
and then finally finance.

06:44.540 --> 06:47.540
But with the enclosures

06:47.540 --> 06:50.540
and the eviction of the peasantry

06:50.540 --> 06:53.540
we had the exact opposite

06:53.540 --> 06:56.540
because suddenly the lord,

06:56.540 --> 06:58.540
the last thing that the lord wanted to do

06:58.540 --> 07:00.540
is to work or to be entrepreneurial.

07:00.540 --> 07:05.540
So the replacement of the peasants with a sheep

07:05.540 --> 07:09.540
meant that suddenly every acre of land

07:09.540 --> 07:12.540
had an economic value, an exchange value, a price

07:12.540 --> 07:15.540
that did not exist, that was not the case before.

07:15.540 --> 07:17.540
Why did it acquire this price?

07:17.540 --> 07:19.540
Because you knew how many sheep

07:19.540 --> 07:21.540
you could raise on an acre.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.540
You know how much more or less

07:23.540 --> 07:24.540
wool you would produce.

07:24.540 --> 07:26.540
International markets were providing

07:26.540 --> 07:28.540
the equilibrium price of the wool

07:28.540 --> 07:31.540
so you knew how much exchange value

07:31.540 --> 07:36.540
money you could gather per acre of your land.

07:36.540 --> 07:40.540
And of course then once that price was established

07:40.540 --> 07:43.540
that exchange value per acre was established

07:43.540 --> 07:46.540
suddenly land became a commodity

07:46.540 --> 07:49.540
to be rented out, to be sold, to be purchased.

07:49.540 --> 07:51.540
There was no real estate market before that.

07:51.540 --> 07:54.540
Land was either you inherited land

07:54.540 --> 07:55.540
in which case you had it

07:55.540 --> 07:57.540
and if you never inherited land you never got it.

07:57.540 --> 08:00.540
And the only way of effectively getting land

08:00.540 --> 08:03.540
that you didn't have was through war, through conquest.

08:03.540 --> 08:06.540
Or if the king decided to grant you

08:06.540 --> 08:07.540
a plot of land.

08:07.540 --> 08:09.540
There was no such thing as a market for land

08:09.540 --> 08:11.540
and there was no such thing as a market of labor.

08:11.540 --> 08:14.540
The enclosures, the eviction of the peasants

08:14.540 --> 08:17.540
created land as a commodity

08:17.540 --> 08:19.540
and of course labor as a commodity

08:19.540 --> 08:21.540
because the evicted peasants

08:21.540 --> 08:24.540
effectively they were roaming around the country

08:24.540 --> 08:26.540
knocking on doors saying

08:26.540 --> 08:28.540
I will do anything for work, for work,

08:28.540 --> 08:29.540
for a piece of bread.

08:29.540 --> 08:31.540
That's the first labor market.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.540
That had never happened before

08:33.540 --> 08:34.540
in the history of humanity.

08:34.540 --> 08:38.540
People with nothing selling their labor time.

08:38.540 --> 08:40.540
That's the beginning of capitalism.

08:40.540 --> 08:44.540
But with this you have the separation

08:44.540 --> 08:46.540
of the economic from the political sphere

08:46.540 --> 08:49.540
for the first time in our history as a species.

08:49.540 --> 08:51.540
Because suddenly you had merchants

08:51.540 --> 08:54.540
who acquired huge power

08:54.540 --> 09:01.540
through the accumulation of financial surpluses

09:01.540 --> 09:04.540
because the internationalization

09:04.540 --> 09:06.540
of those trade routes,

09:06.540 --> 09:08.540
the emergence of these few commodities

09:08.540 --> 09:10.540
as international commodities

09:10.540 --> 09:14.540
that bestowed substantial financial surplus

09:14.540 --> 09:17.540
upon those who handled them

09:17.540 --> 09:19.540
whether they were the merchants,

09:19.540 --> 09:22.540
the ship owners or the lords of the land

09:22.540 --> 09:24.540
whose land now was used

09:24.540 --> 09:28.540
in order to cultivate inverted commerce wool.

09:28.540 --> 09:31.540
For the first time you had this separation.

09:31.540 --> 09:35.540
You had lords whose political power

09:35.540 --> 09:37.540
and social power

09:37.540 --> 09:39.540
were now becoming increasingly

09:39.540 --> 09:41.540
disproportionate to their economic power.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.540
You had those dirty merchants

09:43.540 --> 09:45.540
as they consider them.

09:45.540 --> 09:50.540
The riffraff, the ugly dirty merchants

09:50.540 --> 09:54.540
acquiring huge quantities of economic power

09:54.540 --> 09:56.540
that had nothing to do with their social status.

09:56.540 --> 09:58.540
They were not allowed in the palace.

09:58.540 --> 09:59.540
They were not allowed in parliament.

09:59.540 --> 10:04.540
They were not allowed in the gentlemen's clubs in London.

10:04.540 --> 10:07.540
Suddenly they had a lot more economic power than the lords.

10:07.540 --> 10:10.540
The economic and the political sphere separated.

10:10.540 --> 10:12.540
With industrialization you throw into this mix

10:12.540 --> 10:15.540
James Watts great invention, the steam engine

10:15.540 --> 10:17.540
and this process just goes berserk.

10:17.540 --> 10:19.540
You have globalization

10:19.540 --> 10:22.540
which Karl Marx and Fritzrich Engels

10:22.540 --> 10:24.540
in the manifesto described

10:24.540 --> 10:26.540
in the most poetic language

10:26.540 --> 10:30.540
when they say that capital must nestle everywhere,

10:30.540 --> 10:32.540
it must settle everywhere,

10:32.540 --> 10:34.540
it must enter into relations everywhere.

10:34.540 --> 10:37.540
It was interesting because when Marx and Engels were writing that

10:37.540 --> 10:39.540
it hadn't happened yet.

10:39.540 --> 10:42.540
But they foresaw the process that we live in.

10:42.540 --> 10:44.540
Globalization.

10:44.540 --> 10:48.540
With globalization now we have, well,

10:48.540 --> 10:50.540
with this process of globalization

10:50.540 --> 10:52.540
you have the establishment of these

10:52.540 --> 10:55.540
completely separate two spheres.

10:55.540 --> 10:58.540
Now interestingly in the 19th century

10:58.540 --> 11:00.540
you recall this.

11:02.540 --> 11:05.540
Well, you live in a very historic town.

11:07.540 --> 11:13.540
Liberalism was a philosophy, a political philosophy

11:13.540 --> 11:15.540
at odds with democracy.

11:15.540 --> 11:18.540
To be a liberal, a genuine liberal

11:18.540 --> 11:21.540
you must have been very skeptical about democracy

11:21.540 --> 11:24.540
if not completely and utterly anti-democratic.

11:24.540 --> 11:26.540
The whole point about liberalism

11:26.540 --> 11:28.540
was how to preserve the right

11:28.540 --> 11:30.540
to track barter and exchange

11:30.540 --> 11:33.540
in Adam Smith's famous expression

11:33.540 --> 11:37.540
which was a right that many of the liberals

11:37.540 --> 11:38.540
including John Stuart Mill,

11:38.540 --> 11:40.540
a very liberal person,

11:40.540 --> 11:42.540
a very progressive person for his age,

11:42.540 --> 11:45.540
he considered the idea of democracy

11:45.540 --> 11:46.540
what is democracy,

11:46.540 --> 11:48.540
is the rule of the many

11:48.540 --> 11:51.540
to be a great impediment

11:51.540 --> 11:53.540
if not a great threat to liberalism.

11:53.540 --> 11:58.540
So when we talk about liberal democracy today

11:58.540 --> 11:59.540
we're talking about something

11:59.540 --> 12:00.540
that in the 19th century

12:00.540 --> 12:02.540
was a contradiction in terms

12:02.540 --> 12:03.540
to be a liberal meant

12:03.540 --> 12:05.540
that you did not believe in democracy.

12:07.540 --> 12:09.540
Now what was it that brought about

12:09.540 --> 12:10.540
a change, a transformation?

12:10.540 --> 12:13.540
Suddenly liberals started

12:13.540 --> 12:17.540
embracing the idea of democracy.

12:17.540 --> 12:18.540
It was economic crisis,

12:18.540 --> 12:20.540
financial and economic crisis

12:20.540 --> 12:22.540
beginning especially in this country

12:22.540 --> 12:24.540
in Europe in the 1840s

12:24.540 --> 12:27.540
because the moment capitalism

12:27.540 --> 12:29.540
started turbocharging itself

12:29.540 --> 12:34.540
with the creation of what I will describe

12:34.540 --> 12:37.540
as networked companies

12:37.540 --> 12:42.540
with the advances in electromagnetism,

12:42.540 --> 12:46.540
electric engines, the telegraph,

12:46.540 --> 12:48.540
all the communication technologies,

12:48.540 --> 12:49.540
electricity grids.

12:49.540 --> 12:52.540
When electricity comes into production

12:52.540 --> 12:54.540
and we move beyond steam

12:54.540 --> 12:56.540
that's the second industrial revolution

12:56.540 --> 12:59.540
to create, when Edison created his empire

12:59.540 --> 13:02.540
he created a networked company.

13:02.540 --> 13:05.540
Remember from the electric bulb

13:05.540 --> 13:07.540
to the power generating station,

13:07.540 --> 13:10.540
to the grid, everything was part of this.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.540
We talk about Google now and Apple

13:12.540 --> 13:14.540
as being mega companies,

13:14.540 --> 13:16.540
well the mega company was invented

13:16.540 --> 13:18.540
with the second industrial revolution.

13:18.540 --> 13:20.540
But think about it,

13:20.540 --> 13:22.540
to set up a company like Edison's

13:22.540 --> 13:25.540
or later Henry Ford's and so on

13:25.540 --> 13:27.540
you needed a lot of financing,

13:27.540 --> 13:29.540
you needed a lot of money.

13:29.540 --> 13:34.540
So suddenly the new reversed order

13:34.540 --> 13:36.540
becomes very significant

13:36.540 --> 13:38.540
because now ever since the peasants

13:38.540 --> 13:41.540
were thrown out of the land,

13:41.540 --> 13:44.540
ever since the enclosures in Britain

13:44.540 --> 13:47.540
the Lord rented out,

13:47.540 --> 13:50.540
leased out an acre or a few acres

13:50.540 --> 13:52.540
to an ex peasant and said

13:52.540 --> 13:54.540
okay, I will charge you a rent,

13:54.540 --> 13:56.540
you raise the sheep here

13:56.540 --> 13:59.540
and you keep the difference,

13:59.540 --> 14:01.540
the residual payments.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.540
So once you pay for the land,

14:04.540 --> 14:07.540
me, once you pay the workers,

14:07.540 --> 14:09.540
the ones that have been expelled

14:09.540 --> 14:11.540
and now are working for a piece of bread,

14:11.540 --> 14:13.540
subsistence wages,

14:13.540 --> 14:16.540
once you pay for the sheep,

14:16.540 --> 14:19.540
for the shearing, scissors,

14:19.540 --> 14:21.540
whatever it is that you are using,

14:21.540 --> 14:23.540
your capital equipment,

14:23.540 --> 14:25.540
what you keep in the end is your profit.

14:25.540 --> 14:28.540
So suddenly these proto-entrepreneurs

14:28.540 --> 14:32.540
were forced, they didn't choose to do it,

14:32.540 --> 14:34.540
they were forced to become entrepreneurs,

14:34.540 --> 14:36.540
but how do you become an entrepreneur?

14:36.540 --> 14:38.540
First you borrow,

14:38.540 --> 14:41.540
and usually you borrow it from the landlord.

14:41.540 --> 14:43.540
The landlord lends you the money

14:43.540 --> 14:45.540
to pay him rent,

14:45.540 --> 14:47.540
with interest.

14:47.540 --> 14:49.540
So you see the reversal?

14:49.540 --> 14:51.540
Instead of finance coming at the end,

14:51.540 --> 14:53.540
we used to have production then exchange

14:53.540 --> 14:55.540
or distribution and then finally finance.

14:55.540 --> 14:57.540
Now we have finance first.

14:57.540 --> 15:00.540
At the beginning there was the loan.

15:00.540 --> 15:02.540
Once the loan comes in,

15:02.540 --> 15:04.540
you hire the workers, you pay the rent,

15:04.540 --> 15:06.540
immediately you have distribution.

15:06.540 --> 15:08.540
So you have finance first, distribution second,

15:08.540 --> 15:10.540
the last thing that happens is production.

15:10.540 --> 15:12.540
So finance suddenly acquires

15:12.540 --> 15:15.540
a very special place in capitalism.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.540
Now the beauty and ugliness

15:18.540 --> 15:20.540
of finance, of banking,

15:20.540 --> 15:24.540
is that it is a magical process.

15:24.540 --> 15:27.540
Because once we move from the landlord

15:27.540 --> 15:29.540
to Edison and Henry Ford,

15:29.540 --> 15:32.540
it is impossible to finance capitalism

15:32.540 --> 15:34.540
simply by the accumulated wealth

15:34.540 --> 15:37.540
of some rich person like the Lord.

15:37.540 --> 15:39.540
There was never enough money

15:39.540 --> 15:41.540
in the hands of any financier

15:41.540 --> 15:43.540
to provide Edison with the capital,

15:43.540 --> 15:45.540
with the money he needed

15:45.540 --> 15:48.540
in order to set up his networked firm.

15:48.540 --> 15:52.540
So you needed banks to conjure up money from nothing.

15:52.540 --> 15:54.540
And this is how finance has been working

15:54.540 --> 15:56.540
ever since the Second Industrial Revolution.

15:56.540 --> 15:58.540
How?

15:58.540 --> 16:00.540
By creating money from thin air.

16:00.540 --> 16:03.540
There is a common fallacy

16:03.540 --> 16:06.540
in the popular culture that we live in,

16:06.540 --> 16:09.540
that banks operate like vaults.

16:09.540 --> 16:13.540
Whereby you and I put our savings in

16:13.540 --> 16:16.540
and somebody else goes to the bank

16:16.540 --> 16:19.540
and borrows money that comes from our savings.

16:19.540 --> 16:21.540
And the banker makes a profit

16:21.540 --> 16:23.540
as a result of the difference

16:23.540 --> 16:25.540
between the interest rate

16:25.540 --> 16:27.540
that he pays us

16:27.540 --> 16:30.540
for depositing our money into his vault

16:30.540 --> 16:33.540
and the interest rate that he charges

16:33.540 --> 16:35.540
the person that has borrowed money

16:35.540 --> 16:38.540
in order to invest in a shop, in a factory, whatever.

16:38.540 --> 16:43.540
That is not what is going on.

16:43.540 --> 16:45.540
If you go to the bank tomorrow morning

16:45.540 --> 16:47.540
and you get a loan from the bank,

16:47.540 --> 16:50.540
the money is going to come out of thin air.

16:50.540 --> 16:54.540
The bank will create it out of nothing.

16:54.540 --> 16:56.540
It's really very simple.

16:56.540 --> 16:59.540
You get $100,000 to buy a house,

16:59.540 --> 17:02.540
to invest in a business.

17:02.540 --> 17:04.540
What will happen is

17:04.540 --> 17:06.540
somebody is going to type $100,000

17:06.540 --> 17:10.540
$100,000 into your bank account.

17:10.540 --> 17:12.540
So it's conjured up.

17:12.540 --> 17:15.540
The ancient Greeks had a word for money,

17:15.540 --> 17:17.540
νόμισμα, or coin,

17:17.540 --> 17:19.540
which comes from the verb νόμισμα,

17:19.540 --> 17:21.540
which means to imagine.

17:21.540 --> 17:26.540
So Aristotle defined the value of money

17:26.540 --> 17:29.540
as a common fiction

17:29.540 --> 17:31.540
since the ancient times.

17:31.540 --> 17:33.540
This is exactly what it is.

17:33.540 --> 17:36.540
So the banker simply types the money in there.

17:36.540 --> 17:38.540
You put your card in the ATM

17:38.540 --> 17:40.540
and suddenly you have $100,000.

17:40.540 --> 17:44.540
Somebody typed $100,000 on the system.

17:44.540 --> 17:46.540
Then what you can do is

17:46.540 --> 17:49.540
you can use web banking, you can wire the money.

17:49.540 --> 17:52.540
If you buy a car or a house,

17:52.540 --> 17:55.540
it goes to the bank account of the vendor.

17:55.540 --> 17:58.540
If you invest in a shop,

17:58.540 --> 18:00.540
it goes to the landlord,

18:00.540 --> 18:02.540
to another bank account with the same banking system.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.540
It doesn't matter whether it's the same bank or not.

18:04.540 --> 18:07.540
So these digits that were typed into your account

18:07.540 --> 18:09.540
simply are transferred to another account.

18:09.540 --> 18:11.540
That's all that happens.

18:11.540 --> 18:14.540
Now, the hope of the banker is

18:14.540 --> 18:17.540
that you are going to use this money productively.

18:17.540 --> 18:19.540
You're going to earn money from that

18:19.540 --> 18:21.540
and then you will give the banker

18:21.540 --> 18:24.540
the money that will effectively tie up

18:24.540 --> 18:27.540
that loose end with interest.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.540
Now, to the extent that this works

18:29.540 --> 18:31.540
and it really works magnificently,

18:31.540 --> 18:33.540
in my book I relate this

18:33.540 --> 18:37.540
in the form of a science fiction metaphor.

18:37.540 --> 18:39.540
It's a bit like a banker

18:39.540 --> 18:43.540
being the specially gifted magician

18:43.540 --> 18:45.540
who has a very long arm

18:45.540 --> 18:48.540
and can push his arm, it's usually he,

18:48.540 --> 18:52.540
so allow me not to say she or he.

18:52.540 --> 18:56.540
Through the timeline,

18:56.540 --> 18:58.540
he pushes his hand into the future,

18:58.540 --> 19:02.540
grabs value that has not been created yet,

19:02.540 --> 19:04.540
snatches it from the future,

19:04.540 --> 19:06.540
brings it into the present

19:06.540 --> 19:08.540
and gives it to you.

19:08.540 --> 19:10.540
Hopefully you do productive things

19:10.540 --> 19:12.540
and you create a value that will repay the future.

19:12.540 --> 19:14.540
This is my preferred metaphor

19:14.540 --> 19:16.540
for what bankers do.

19:16.540 --> 19:19.540
But once they learn the beauty

19:19.540 --> 19:22.540
and the glory of doing this

19:22.540 --> 19:24.540
and they are privileged

19:24.540 --> 19:26.540
in a privileged spot

19:26.540 --> 19:28.540
because they can take value from the future,

19:28.540 --> 19:31.540
bring it to the present, they don't do any work themselves.

19:31.540 --> 19:33.540
Because they are the mediators

19:33.540 --> 19:36.540
between future and present value,

19:36.540 --> 19:38.540
they are ultra-rich

19:38.540 --> 19:40.540
and not only ultra-rich,

19:40.540 --> 19:43.540
but central in societal processes,

19:43.540 --> 19:45.540
political processes.

19:45.540 --> 19:47.540
So if you do this and it works,

19:47.540 --> 19:49.540
why not do more of it?

19:49.540 --> 19:51.540
Keep snatching more value from the future

19:51.540 --> 19:53.540
and bringing it to the present.

19:53.540 --> 19:56.540
At some point, the present can no longer produce

19:56.540 --> 19:58.540
the value that it needs to produce

19:58.540 --> 20:00.540
in order to repay the present.

20:00.540 --> 20:03.540
At that point, suddenly,

20:03.540 --> 20:05.540
those of us who have borrowed money

20:05.540 --> 20:07.540
or some of us

20:07.540 --> 20:09.540
have no capacity to repay it,

20:09.540 --> 20:11.540
a recession begins,

20:11.540 --> 20:13.540
people that work for us lose their jobs,

20:13.540 --> 20:16.540
they cannot repay their own loans

20:16.540 --> 20:19.540
and suddenly, the book of the bank

20:19.540 --> 20:22.540
is full of loans that are non-performing.

20:22.540 --> 20:25.540
At that point, if you and I

20:25.540 --> 20:27.540
or those of us who have some money in the bank

20:27.540 --> 20:29.540
realize that this is happening,

20:29.540 --> 20:31.540
we panic, we rush to the bank,

20:31.540 --> 20:33.540
this is a bank run, we ask for the cash,

20:33.540 --> 20:35.540
the cash is not there.

20:35.540 --> 20:37.540
And then you have the financial crisis

20:37.540 --> 20:39.540
that we had in this country

20:39.540 --> 20:42.540
and in Europe from the 1840s onwards.

20:42.540 --> 20:45.540
Now, to a very large extent,

20:45.540 --> 20:47.540
the United States of America,

20:47.540 --> 20:49.540
the way you understand your own country now,

20:49.540 --> 20:53.540
is the product of this political response

20:53.540 --> 20:55.540
to a sequence of financial crisis

20:55.540 --> 20:57.540
beginning from the 1840s.

20:57.540 --> 20:59.540
Even the creation of the Federal Reserve

20:59.540 --> 21:01.540
in the beginning of the 20th century

21:01.540 --> 21:03.540
was the result of J.P. Morgan saying,

21:03.540 --> 21:06.540
I've had enough of bailing out my mates.

21:06.540 --> 21:08.540
Let's create a Federal Reserve

21:08.540 --> 21:10.540
that is going to be doing the job.

21:10.540 --> 21:12.540
And of course, he created it.

21:12.540 --> 21:15.540
It was all stitched up amongst the bankers.

21:15.540 --> 21:19.540
Think of all the great institutions of this country,

21:19.540 --> 21:22.540
like social security, food stamps,

21:22.540 --> 21:24.540
they are the result of 1929.

21:24.540 --> 21:26.540
It's what brought this nation together,

21:26.540 --> 21:28.540
what created the United States of America,

21:28.540 --> 21:30.540
the way you understand it.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.540
It's a sequence of financial collapses

21:32.540 --> 21:36.540
that puts together nations

21:36.540 --> 21:39.540
and politics and democratic processes.

21:39.540 --> 21:44.540
So, let me go back to the beginning.

21:44.540 --> 21:47.540
We used to have one sphere of power.

21:47.540 --> 21:52.540
It was political, economic, cultural, military.

21:52.540 --> 21:56.540
Power had many different facets,

21:56.540 --> 22:02.540
but it was one sphere in which it emerged from.

22:02.540 --> 22:05.540
Then it separated into two spheres,

22:05.540 --> 22:07.540
the political sphere and the economic sphere.

22:07.540 --> 22:11.540
And as it did,

22:11.540 --> 22:15.540
the political sphere was increasingly democratized.

22:15.540 --> 22:16.540
Why?

22:16.540 --> 22:17.540
Because all the important decisions

22:17.540 --> 22:19.540
were moving to the economic sphere.

22:19.540 --> 22:22.540
So, political legitimacy

22:22.540 --> 22:25.540
and the capacity of the regime,

22:25.540 --> 22:27.540
of the system that we live in,

22:27.540 --> 22:30.540
to maintain itself and to be sustainable

22:30.540 --> 22:33.540
through the common belief amongst the people

22:33.540 --> 22:36.540
that this is a legitimate system,

22:36.540 --> 22:39.540
was based on democratization of giving people the idea

22:39.540 --> 22:42.540
that they had control over their communities,

22:42.540 --> 22:45.540
the nation, their politics.

22:45.540 --> 22:48.540
But this democratization was only accepted

22:48.540 --> 22:50.540
by the proponents of liberalism

22:50.540 --> 22:54.540
to the extent that all the important decisions

22:54.540 --> 22:57.540
were migrating from the political sphere

22:57.540 --> 22:59.540
as the political sphere was democratized.

22:59.540 --> 23:01.540
Women understand that.

23:01.540 --> 23:05.540
It's like the feminization of certain professions.

23:05.540 --> 23:07.540
When women moved into teaching,

23:07.540 --> 23:09.540
teaching lost its power.

23:09.540 --> 23:11.540
When they moved into health,

23:11.540 --> 23:15.540
increased now the majority of judges are women.

23:15.540 --> 23:18.540
And you should see the judicial system collapsing.

23:18.540 --> 23:21.540
So, it's a very similar process that we see.

23:21.540 --> 23:23.540
Power is migrating from the economic sphere

23:23.540 --> 23:25.540
to the political sphere,

23:25.540 --> 23:28.540
and the political sphere is democratized increasingly.

23:28.540 --> 23:31.540
Now, something fundamental happened

23:31.540 --> 23:34.540
beginning in this country in the 1970s.

23:34.540 --> 23:37.540
After the end of Bretton Woods,

23:37.540 --> 23:40.540
which was what? What was Bretton Woods?

23:40.540 --> 23:42.540
Let's not get complicated.

23:42.540 --> 23:45.540
It was the globalization of the New Deal.

23:45.540 --> 23:48.540
Roosevelt's New Deal in 1933,

23:48.540 --> 23:51.540
what was the basic idea?

23:51.540 --> 23:53.540
To put the financial genie,

23:53.540 --> 23:56.540
the banking genie back into its bottle,

23:56.540 --> 23:59.540
to make banking boring,

23:59.540 --> 24:02.540
effectively to ban bankers from doing things

24:02.540 --> 24:06.540
that allowed too much money to be created

24:06.540 --> 24:09.540
and too many bubbles to be built up,

24:09.540 --> 24:12.540
mobilizing idle savings,

24:12.540 --> 24:15.540
the idle savings of the richer members of society,

24:15.540 --> 24:18.540
and putting those idle savings,

24:18.540 --> 24:21.540
turning them into a force in the public interest,

24:21.540 --> 24:25.540
infrastructural works, public works,

24:25.540 --> 24:28.540
education, social security and so on.

24:28.540 --> 24:30.540
That was the New Deal.

24:30.540 --> 24:32.540
But towards the end of the war,

24:32.540 --> 24:35.540
the New Dealers extended that New Deal

24:35.540 --> 24:37.540
internationally,

24:37.540 --> 24:41.540
as Europe was just a pile of ashes.

24:41.540 --> 24:44.540
Japan, you don't need me to explain

24:44.540 --> 24:46.540
what happened to Japan in 1945.

24:46.540 --> 24:49.540
So Bretton Woods, it was a magnificent system.

24:49.540 --> 24:54.540
Think about it, the United States official dome in DC

24:54.540 --> 24:57.540
effectively designed a global capitalist system

24:57.540 --> 24:59.540
that was like a planned economy.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.540
4% interest rates forever,

25:01.540 --> 25:03.540
20 years of 4% interest rates,

25:03.540 --> 25:05.540
no ups and downs, maybe,

25:05.540 --> 25:07.540
plus or minus 0.1%.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.540
So you knew what your mortgage rate

25:09.540 --> 25:12.540
would be in the next 20 years.

25:12.540 --> 25:14.540
You knew if you wanted to change

25:14.540 --> 25:16.540
dollars for British pounds,

25:16.540 --> 25:18.540
you knew how many pounds you would get.

25:18.540 --> 25:21.540
You would get the same quantity year in, year out.

25:21.540 --> 25:23.540
So it was a world which was a nightmare

25:23.540 --> 25:25.540
for finances and of course,

25:25.540 --> 25:27.540
that was by design.

25:27.540 --> 25:29.540
Did you know that in the Bretton Woods

25:29.540 --> 25:32.540
conference in New Hampshire in 1944,

25:32.540 --> 25:38.540
Roosevelt imposed one single rule on his own.

25:38.540 --> 25:41.540
The rest he left to his minions.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.540
They were representatives from

25:43.540 --> 25:45.540
100 different countries.

25:45.540 --> 25:47.540
Most of them already,

25:47.540 --> 25:49.540
they were not even liberated yet.

25:49.540 --> 25:51.540
They were under occupation because it was 1944.

25:51.540 --> 25:53.540
The Second World War had not ended.

25:53.540 --> 25:56.540
Experts, diplomats, politicians and so on.

25:56.540 --> 25:59.540
One species of humanity was banned

25:59.540 --> 26:05.540
from entering the Washington Hotel bankers.

26:05.540 --> 26:09.540
A whole monetary global system was created

26:09.540 --> 26:12.540
on condition that bankers would not be part of it.

26:12.540 --> 26:14.540
Yeah, interesting.

26:14.540 --> 26:16.540
If anybody proposed this today,

26:16.540 --> 26:18.540
they would immediately be branded as

26:18.540 --> 26:20.540
raving communist lunatics.

26:20.540 --> 26:23.540
This was Bretton Woods, 1944.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.540
You know, it's important to think back

26:26.540 --> 26:29.540
about possibilities when we think of what is possible.

26:29.540 --> 26:32.540
Well, what happened in 1944 in Bretton Woods

26:32.540 --> 26:34.540
in 1930, 1931 in this country

26:34.540 --> 26:37.540
would have been completely pie in the sky.

26:37.540 --> 26:40.540
So anyway, but that system collapsed

26:40.540 --> 26:43.540
towards the end of the 1960s,

26:43.540 --> 26:46.540
officially 15th of August 1971

26:46.540 --> 26:49.540
with Nixon's announcement that it's kaput, it's finished.

26:49.540 --> 26:51.540
I'm not going to go into this,

26:51.540 --> 26:54.540
but what happened after that was

26:54.540 --> 26:59.540
a very interesting, fascinating reversal

26:59.540 --> 27:03.540
in the flow of trade and money around the world.

27:03.540 --> 27:06.540
Before the collapse of Bretton Woods,

27:06.540 --> 27:07.540
what was happening was this.

27:07.540 --> 27:09.540
This is how Bretton Woods was designed.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.540
America was a surplus country.

27:11.540 --> 27:13.540
The country was surplus, with profits.

27:15.540 --> 27:17.540
Especially after the Second World War,

27:17.540 --> 27:19.540
was the only credit of the country.

27:19.540 --> 27:22.540
They had the financial surplus, the surplus of goods

27:22.540 --> 27:24.540
and a tax porter.

27:24.540 --> 27:27.540
And what the United States Administration did

27:27.540 --> 27:29.540
as part of Bretton Woods was to say,

27:29.540 --> 27:31.540
okay, the only way of preventing a return

27:31.540 --> 27:34.540
of the Great Depression to this land by 1949,

27:34.540 --> 27:36.540
they were very worried about 1949

27:36.540 --> 27:39.540
because it was 1929 plus 20.

27:39.540 --> 27:41.540
The only way of preventing it is to make sure that,

27:41.540 --> 27:44.540
okay, number one, we convert all the factories

27:44.540 --> 27:48.540
from military production to civilian production,

27:48.540 --> 27:51.540
using white goods instead of tanks and bullets,

27:51.540 --> 27:55.540
producing cars instead of aircraft carriers.

27:55.540 --> 27:57.540
Right, but that's not enough,

27:57.540 --> 28:00.540
because those factories during the war economy

28:00.540 --> 28:03.540
were so productive in this country

28:03.540 --> 28:06.540
that they were capable of producing

28:06.540 --> 28:08.540
so many washing machine tractors and cars

28:08.540 --> 28:12.540
that Americans would simply not have enough use for them.

28:12.540 --> 28:16.540
The only way of preventing the Great Depression from returning

28:16.540 --> 28:18.540
was by selling them to the Europeans.

28:18.540 --> 28:20.540
But the Europeans didn't have money.

28:20.540 --> 28:22.540
So, new dealers, being very practical,

28:22.540 --> 28:24.540
people said, we'll give them the money.

28:24.540 --> 28:26.540
This is what's called the Marshall Aid Plan,

28:26.540 --> 28:28.540
surplus recycling.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.540
For 20 years, the United States was recycling

28:30.540 --> 28:35.540
about 70% of American profits in Japan and in Europe,

28:35.540 --> 28:39.540
because this is what you do if you are a clever hegemon.

28:39.540 --> 28:43.540
What you do is you make sure that the only way

28:43.540 --> 28:45.540
you can continue to have surpluses,

28:45.540 --> 28:48.540
vis-à-vis somebody else, is to finance them.

28:48.540 --> 28:50.540
Because if you don't, then they won't be able

28:50.540 --> 28:52.540
to afford to buy your stuff.

28:52.540 --> 28:54.540
Then you won't be able to have surpluses.

28:54.540 --> 28:56.540
The problem was, however, that those surpluses

28:56.540 --> 28:58.540
disappeared by the late 60s.

28:58.540 --> 29:01.540
America shifted from a surplus position to a deficit position.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.540
Both the government went in deficit

29:03.540 --> 29:09.540
and the American economy developed a trade deficit.

29:09.540 --> 29:14.540
It is fascinating that what happened after

29:14.540 --> 29:16.540
the collapse of Bretton Woods had been imagined

29:16.540 --> 29:20.540
by some smart fellows in this country.

29:20.540 --> 29:23.540
Remember Henry Kissinger?

29:23.540 --> 29:26.540
Yeah.

29:26.540 --> 29:28.540
Exactly my feelings.

29:28.540 --> 29:33.540
But he was a smart cookie, right?

29:33.540 --> 29:37.540
In 1970, a year before the end of Bretton Woods,

29:37.540 --> 29:41.540
he was not yet Secretary of State.

29:41.540 --> 29:47.540
He was still head of the National Security Council.

29:47.540 --> 29:51.540
Of course, he is a Cold Warrior, geopolitical thinker,

29:51.540 --> 29:54.540
things in terms of a bit like Metternich would have

29:54.540 --> 29:57.540
in the 19th century.

29:57.540 --> 30:01.540
He comes from the same part of the world, has the same accent.

30:01.540 --> 30:04.540
He asked all the people that were working for him

30:04.540 --> 30:06.540
that pertinent question.

30:06.540 --> 30:10.540
Now that the United States is shifting into a deficit position,

30:10.540 --> 30:12.540
we used to be a...

30:12.540 --> 30:14.540
Now we are going to become a deficit country.

30:14.540 --> 30:17.540
How can we maintain our global hegemony?

30:17.540 --> 30:20.540
Because it has never happened in the past.

30:20.540 --> 30:25.540
All empires, superpowers fell once they became deficit countries

30:25.540 --> 30:27.540
or economic blocks.

30:27.540 --> 30:28.540
So he was worried about that.

30:28.540 --> 30:30.540
He didn't give a damn about economics,

30:30.540 --> 30:32.540
but he cared about power.

30:32.540 --> 30:37.540
A young man wrote a memo.

30:37.540 --> 30:40.540
Thick waters of a page in reply.

30:40.540 --> 30:42.540
It was the most brilliant reply,

30:42.540 --> 30:44.540
and the one that really explains what happened

30:44.540 --> 30:48.540
between the 1970s and 2008 in the world

30:48.540 --> 30:50.540
and of course in the United States.

30:50.540 --> 30:53.540
His answer was, it doesn't really matter

30:53.540 --> 30:56.540
whose surpluses are being recycled.

30:56.540 --> 30:59.540
What really matters to maintain in control

30:59.540 --> 31:04.540
is the one who is recycling other people's surpluses.

31:04.540 --> 31:06.540
Get it?

31:06.540 --> 31:10.540
We can maintain our superpower status, our hegemony,

31:10.540 --> 31:13.540
as long as we do the recycling of surpluses,

31:13.540 --> 31:15.540
even if the surpluses are not ours.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.540
Think about it.

31:16.540 --> 31:21.540
This is exactly the model that we have been living through

31:21.540 --> 31:23.540
between the 1970s and 2008.

31:23.540 --> 31:26.540
America turned into a deficit country.

31:26.540 --> 31:27.540
The Trump is complaining,

31:27.540 --> 31:30.540
we have a huge trade deficit with China, with Germany,

31:30.540 --> 31:32.540
we need to eliminate it.

31:32.540 --> 31:35.540
Either he is completely unschooled

31:35.540 --> 31:37.540
or he is lying.

31:37.540 --> 31:39.540
Or both.

31:39.540 --> 31:43.540
I added the third option.

31:43.540 --> 31:48.540
Because globalization would not have happened

31:48.540 --> 31:50.540
without the American deficits.

31:50.540 --> 31:55.540
The American trade deficit operated like a gigantic vacuum cleaner

31:55.540 --> 31:58.540
but was sucking into this country

31:58.540 --> 32:01.540
the net exports of Germany, of Holland, of France, of Japan

32:01.540 --> 32:03.540
and later of course of China.

32:03.540 --> 32:08.540
Keeping those factories going at full blast.

32:08.540 --> 32:12.540
And this deficit kept increasing.

32:12.540 --> 32:16.540
It is this increasing American trade deficit

32:16.540 --> 32:22.540
that kept globalized capitalism in rude health.

32:22.540 --> 32:24.540
Of course, the question then is,

32:24.540 --> 32:26.540
how was it being paid for?

32:26.540 --> 32:28.540
Because Greece had a big deficit

32:28.540 --> 32:31.540
and look at what happened to us.

32:31.540 --> 32:33.540
Well, this is the exorbitant privilege

32:33.540 --> 32:36.540
of the United States of America.

32:36.540 --> 32:40.540
At the very same time that the trade deficit was expanding,

32:40.540 --> 32:44.540
the rest of the world was sending to this country

32:44.540 --> 32:47.540
70% of all profits that Germans made,

32:47.540 --> 32:50.540
the Dutch made, the Japanese made

32:50.540 --> 32:52.540
and the Chinese are making.

32:52.540 --> 32:57.540
70% of global profits were coming into Wall Street,

32:57.540 --> 33:00.540
seeking higher returns,

33:00.540 --> 33:03.540
being used to purchase US Treasury bills,

33:03.540 --> 33:05.540
American government debt

33:05.540 --> 33:09.540
and so you had a pure recycling loop.

33:09.540 --> 33:13.540
So recycling was discovered by this young man

33:13.540 --> 33:16.540
whose name by the way is Paul Volcker

33:16.540 --> 33:19.540
who then became the chairman of the Fed

33:19.540 --> 33:22.540
a week before he assumed the position of chairman of the Fed

33:22.540 --> 33:25.540
in a lecture he gave at the University of Oregon, England.

33:25.540 --> 33:29.540
He said, this is the time when a controlled disintegration

33:29.540 --> 33:32.540
of the world economy is in the interest

33:32.540 --> 33:34.540
of the United States of America, verbatim,

33:34.540 --> 33:37.540
I've learned this off by heart because it's so exciting.

33:37.540 --> 33:40.540
The controlled disintegration of the world economy,

33:40.540 --> 33:42.540
so that's what he meant.

33:42.540 --> 33:45.540
So you had this amazing system where

33:45.540 --> 33:48.540
you have increasing imbalances globally

33:48.540 --> 33:51.540
America growing its deficits.

33:51.540 --> 33:54.540
Germany and Japan and then China

33:54.540 --> 33:56.540
growing its surpluses.

33:56.540 --> 33:58.540
When we increase our deficit,

33:58.540 --> 34:00.540
we are creating an imbalance.

34:00.540 --> 34:02.540
When somebody else is increasing their surplus,

34:02.540 --> 34:04.540
that's an imbalance.

34:04.540 --> 34:06.540
And globalization was based on this.

34:06.540 --> 34:08.540
Financialization, what's financialization?

34:08.540 --> 34:10.540
Why did Wall Street,

34:10.540 --> 34:12.540
why was Wall Street allowed to go crazy?

34:12.540 --> 34:16.540
Why were all the checks and balances

34:16.540 --> 34:18.540
the newly dealers introduced

34:18.540 --> 34:20.540
and Bretton Woods introduced?

34:20.540 --> 34:22.540
Why did they go to the dogs?

34:22.540 --> 34:24.540
Why did Larry Summers,

34:24.540 --> 34:26.540
I believe he's got some connection with this place.

34:26.540 --> 34:29.540
Why was he allowed to commit the crime against logic and humanity?

34:29.540 --> 34:32.540
To unleash the Wall Street bankers

34:32.540 --> 34:34.540
from their shackles.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.540
The result being 2008.

34:36.540 --> 34:40.540
The answer is, because without

34:40.540 --> 34:42.540
unleashing the Wall Street bankers,

34:42.540 --> 34:45.540
it was impossible to close that loop.

34:45.540 --> 34:49.540
The only way you could have this model of the world economy

34:49.540 --> 34:52.540
where the United States deficit

34:52.540 --> 34:55.540
was keeping the rest of globalization going

34:55.540 --> 34:58.540
with the rest of the world

34:58.540 --> 35:01.540
sending its surpluses into Wall Street

35:01.540 --> 35:03.540
for Wall Street to close the loop

35:03.540 --> 35:05.540
and pay for the deficit

35:05.540 --> 35:09.540
was to let the Wall Street bankers do as they pleased.

35:09.540 --> 35:12.540
And when you do let the Wall Street bankers do as they please

35:12.540 --> 35:14.540
you know what they do?

35:14.540 --> 35:17.540
With a banker, a few billion every day

35:17.540 --> 35:19.540
for five minutes

35:19.540 --> 35:21.540
just part five billion with a banker

35:21.540 --> 35:23.540
for five minutes every day.

35:23.540 --> 35:25.540
This is to invite them

35:25.540 --> 35:28.540
to create very sophisticated bets

35:28.540 --> 35:31.540
using that five billion every day

35:31.540 --> 35:34.540
that they are always going to win.

35:34.540 --> 35:37.540
If I were to give you five billion every day

35:37.540 --> 35:39.540
for five minutes you would work out ways

35:39.540 --> 35:42.540
of making a load of money

35:43.540 --> 35:46.540
and exponentially increasing load of money.

35:46.540 --> 35:48.540
Anyway, the problem is that they built

35:48.540 --> 35:52.540
so many pyramids of financialized derivatives

35:52.540 --> 35:54.540
on top of this tsunami of capital

35:54.540 --> 35:56.540
that the rest of the world was saying

35:56.540 --> 35:58.540
that it combusted in 2008

35:58.540 --> 36:01.540
and the result was what we're facing.

36:01.540 --> 36:04.540
So, the point I'm making is that

36:04.540 --> 36:08.540
first you had the joint sphere of power

36:08.540 --> 36:11.540
then that bisected into the political

36:11.540 --> 36:13.540
and economic sphere

36:13.540 --> 36:15.540
then after the 1970s the end of Bretton Wood

36:15.540 --> 36:18.540
the economic sphere was also divided

36:18.540 --> 36:21.540
and multiplied between the industrial sphere

36:21.540 --> 36:23.540
and the financial sphere.

36:23.540 --> 36:26.540
And all power ended up with finance

36:26.540 --> 36:29.540
because if you allow bankers to push their hand

36:29.540 --> 36:32.540
into the future so majestically, frequently

36:32.540 --> 36:35.540
and without any kind of control

36:35.540 --> 36:38.540
to bring value that has not been produced yet

36:38.540 --> 36:41.540
into the future and effectively to appropriate themselves

36:41.540 --> 36:43.540
and then you also say to them

36:43.540 --> 36:46.540
that they are too big to fail and when they fail

36:46.540 --> 36:48.540
then austerity for all is combined

36:48.540 --> 36:50.540
with socialism for the bankers

36:50.540 --> 36:52.540
then they have no reason

36:52.540 --> 36:55.540
why not to keep undermining capitalism

36:55.540 --> 36:57.540
again and again and again.

36:57.540 --> 37:01.540
So, remember the question with which I started.

37:01.540 --> 37:04.540
Why do politicians seem to be

37:04.540 --> 37:06.540
so much less talented today

37:06.540 --> 37:09.540
than they were, you know, 40 years ago

37:09.540 --> 37:11.540
20 years ago, 30 years ago?

37:11.540 --> 37:14.540
Well, the answer is because the political sphere

37:14.540 --> 37:16.540
is completely powerless.

37:16.540 --> 37:19.540
The spheres that now have acquired power

37:19.540 --> 37:22.540
are the economic sphere and magnificently the financial sphere.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.540
So, if you're a young, talented person

37:24.540 --> 37:27.540
who wants to change the world, who wants to do things?

37:27.540 --> 37:30.540
Who's not very ideological or historical minded?

37:30.540 --> 37:32.540
Who wants power?

37:32.540 --> 37:34.540
What do you want to be president of the United States

37:34.540 --> 37:36.540
or Goldman Sachs?

37:36.540 --> 37:38.540
CEO of Goldman Sachs.

37:38.540 --> 37:41.540
I remember the one long conversation,

37:41.540 --> 37:44.540
longish conversation I had with Barack Obama

37:44.540 --> 37:48.540
when I was the finance minister of Greece.

37:48.540 --> 37:51.540
The first thing he said to me was

37:51.540 --> 37:53.540
I feel solidarity for the Greek people

37:53.540 --> 37:55.540
and we are behind you

37:55.540 --> 37:58.540
but there's not much I can do to help.

37:58.540 --> 38:02.540
And then he immediately, without me saying anything

38:02.540 --> 38:05.540
he went into a solidarity justifying himself

38:05.540 --> 38:07.540
by saying, you know, when I got elected

38:07.540 --> 38:09.540
I realized there was nothing I could do

38:09.540 --> 38:11.540
because Wall Street had just imploded

38:11.540 --> 38:13.540
and I had to save them

38:13.540 --> 38:15.540
and that was, he said, political poison for me.

38:15.540 --> 38:18.540
Now, I don't know whether he believed it or not

38:18.540 --> 38:21.540
and I can't see how he can explain the fact

38:21.540 --> 38:25.540
that he appointed Larry Summers to sort out the mess

38:25.540 --> 38:28.540
unless of course, you know, you adopt the cynical view

38:28.540 --> 38:32.540
that it takes a murderer to work out

38:32.540 --> 38:36.540
how the criminal justice system should be reformed.

38:40.540 --> 38:45.540
So this is effectively the point I'm making.

38:45.540 --> 38:48.540
So, is capitalism consistent

38:48.540 --> 38:56.540
or sustainable within a democratic polity?

38:56.540 --> 38:59.540
Can it coexist with democracy?

38:59.540 --> 39:01.540
Absolutely not

39:01.540 --> 39:06.540
because capitalism is generating this shift of power

39:06.540 --> 39:08.540
away from the political sphere

39:08.540 --> 39:13.540
and even if you have fantastically scripted constitutions

39:13.540 --> 39:17.540
beautiful congresses with wonderful procedures and so on

39:17.540 --> 39:21.540
power is going to shift away from those processes

39:21.540 --> 39:24.540
they're going to become fig leaves for a system

39:24.540 --> 39:26.540
where power leaves somewhere else.

39:26.540 --> 39:31.540
In my first meeting of finance ministers in Europe

39:33.540 --> 39:36.540
I was exposed to this harsh reality

39:36.540 --> 39:38.540
which I always knew

39:38.540 --> 39:40.540
but it's one thing to know it as a radical lefty

39:40.540 --> 39:43.540
that theorizes

39:43.540 --> 39:48.540
and puts forward various working hypotheses

39:48.540 --> 39:50.540
in an academic environment

39:50.540 --> 39:53.540
it's quite another to be told straight in your face.

39:53.540 --> 39:55.540
The beauty of those few months I spent in government

39:55.540 --> 39:57.540
was exactly that

39:57.540 --> 40:00.540
I didn't have to theorize anymore

40:00.540 --> 40:04.540
I went to my first meeting of the Eurogroup

40:04.540 --> 40:08.540
the Eurogroup is the meeting of the European Union

40:08.540 --> 40:10.540
finance ministers of the countries

40:10.540 --> 40:12.540
that share the same currency the year

40:12.540 --> 40:16.540
So I walked in there and I tried to be as moderate

40:16.540 --> 40:18.540
and as sensible

40:18.540 --> 40:21.540
and as friendly

40:21.540 --> 40:25.540
as anyone who comes from a country that is bankrupt

40:25.540 --> 40:27.540
and whose new government has a title

40:27.540 --> 40:29.540
or the party that won

40:29.540 --> 40:32.540
coalition of the radical left

40:32.540 --> 40:35.540
So there I was the minister of finance

40:35.540 --> 40:37.540
representing the coalition of the radical left

40:37.540 --> 40:40.540
in that cesspool of conservatism

40:40.540 --> 40:42.540
and I tried to be

40:42.540 --> 40:44.540
all I said was

40:44.540 --> 40:49.540
that we are facing a challenge

40:49.540 --> 40:51.540
colleagues

40:51.540 --> 40:53.540
there is the principle I said

40:53.540 --> 40:55.540
of continuity

40:55.540 --> 40:57.540
in democracies

40:57.540 --> 40:59.540
in other words

40:59.540 --> 41:02.540
we are not going to start at year zero

41:02.540 --> 41:04.540
just because we are just elected

41:04.540 --> 41:06.540
we have obligations to you

41:06.540 --> 41:08.540
that previous governments, Greek governments

41:08.540 --> 41:10.540
have assumed

41:10.540 --> 41:12.540
and which of course we were against

41:12.540 --> 41:14.540
our party was against but nevertheless

41:14.540 --> 41:18.540
our state because of the principle of continuity

41:18.540 --> 41:20.540
still has these obligations to you

41:20.540 --> 41:22.540
and therefore I cannot dismiss them

41:22.540 --> 41:24.540
I have to take them seriously

41:24.540 --> 41:26.540
I am obliged by the principle of continuity

41:26.540 --> 41:28.540
at the same time there is another principle

41:28.540 --> 41:31.540
the principle of democracy

41:31.540 --> 41:34.540
I could see that we didn't like that very much

41:34.540 --> 41:36.540
and the principle of democracy is very simple

41:36.540 --> 41:39.540
I have a mandate from the people of Greece

41:39.540 --> 41:41.540
to challenge all these obligations

41:41.540 --> 41:43.540
that we have in this particular fiscal

41:43.540 --> 41:45.540
and monetary policy

41:45.540 --> 41:47.540
that you've been imposing upon my country

41:47.540 --> 41:49.540
which led to a great depression

41:49.540 --> 41:51.540
which led me to be here

41:51.540 --> 41:53.540
because if we didn't have a great depression

41:53.540 --> 41:55.540
the Greeks were not stupid enough to vote for me

41:55.540 --> 41:58.540
they didn't just become left wingers

41:58.540 --> 42:01.540
our party went from 4% to 40%

42:01.540 --> 42:03.540
in two and a half years because of the great depression

42:03.540 --> 42:05.540
I didn't put it in those very words

42:05.540 --> 42:07.540
but you can imagine

42:07.540 --> 42:09.540
but more or less this was my mandate

42:09.540 --> 42:12.540
I was trying to be extremely open to them

42:12.540 --> 42:15.540
and moderate and conciliatory

42:15.540 --> 42:17.540
with Wolfgang Schäuble

42:17.540 --> 42:19.540
the finance minister of Germany

42:19.540 --> 42:22.540
and I said what happens in democracy

42:22.540 --> 42:25.540
when two principles clash

42:25.540 --> 42:27.540
the principle of continuity and the principle of democracy

42:27.540 --> 42:29.540
well we sit around the table like civilized people

42:29.540 --> 42:31.540
and we find a compromise

42:31.540 --> 42:33.540
this is what democracy do

42:33.540 --> 42:35.540
liberal democracy yes

42:35.540 --> 42:37.540
I sit down, the French minister

42:37.540 --> 42:39.540
loved what I said

42:39.540 --> 42:41.540
of course

42:41.540 --> 42:43.540
just complete hot air

42:43.540 --> 42:46.540
yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

42:46.540 --> 42:48.540
I could see Wolfgang Schäuble

42:48.540 --> 42:50.540
the German finance minister

42:50.540 --> 42:53.540
he was looking at me with eyes

42:53.540 --> 42:56.540
that felt like laser beams

42:56.540 --> 42:59.540
and he gets the floor and he said

42:59.540 --> 43:01.540
one sentence, one sentence

43:01.540 --> 43:04.540
which is the one that I'm going to leave you with

43:04.540 --> 43:07.540
elections cannot be allowed

43:07.540 --> 43:10.540
to change economic policy

43:14.540 --> 43:17.540
got it?

43:17.540 --> 43:19.540
my response was

43:19.540 --> 43:21.540
this is excellent news

43:21.540 --> 43:23.540
to the Chinese Communist Party

43:23.540 --> 43:25.540
because they believe that too

43:25.540 --> 43:27.540
and I then came up with a proposal

43:27.540 --> 43:29.540
this is why they hated me

43:29.540 --> 43:31.540
very moderate and said

43:31.540 --> 43:33.540
in that case Wolfgang

43:33.540 --> 43:35.540
let's ban elections

43:35.540 --> 43:38.540
in bankrupt countries

43:38.540 --> 43:41.540
let's come out and declare

43:41.540 --> 43:43.540
that in the European Union

43:43.540 --> 43:45.540
you can only have democracy

43:45.540 --> 43:47.540
if you are a credit or country

43:47.540 --> 43:49.540
if you are a debt or country

43:49.540 --> 43:51.540
no democracy, elections cannot be allowed

43:51.540 --> 43:53.540
to change anything

43:53.540 --> 43:55.540
because we have a loan agreement

43:55.540 --> 43:57.540
we have a debtors prison

43:57.540 --> 43:59.540
let's put Greece in the workhouse

43:59.540 --> 44:01.540
I didn't say all these things

44:01.540 --> 44:03.540
but I did say the thing about the Chinese Communist Party

44:03.540 --> 44:05.540
and also the proposal that we

44:05.540 --> 44:07.540
suspend elections while a country

44:07.540 --> 44:09.540
is in the red

44:09.540 --> 44:11.540
but I'm more honest

44:11.540 --> 44:13.540
so the reason why I'm mentioning this is

44:13.540 --> 44:15.540
that

44:15.540 --> 44:17.540
Shoibley was right

44:19.540 --> 44:21.540
in the capitalist

44:21.540 --> 44:23.540
the globalized

44:23.540 --> 44:25.540
financialized capitalism that we have created

44:25.540 --> 44:27.540
elections cannot be allowed

44:27.540 --> 44:29.540
to change economic policy

44:29.540 --> 44:31.540
because

44:31.540 --> 44:33.540
economic policy simply

44:33.540 --> 44:35.540
springs out of the processes

44:35.540 --> 44:37.540
that I described

44:37.540 --> 44:39.540
and that leave

44:39.540 --> 44:41.540
absolutely no room

44:41.540 --> 44:43.540
for anything beyond a semblance

44:43.540 --> 44:45.540
of a democratic process

44:45.540 --> 44:47.540
that legitimizes

44:47.540 --> 44:49.540
the lack of democracy

44:49.540 --> 44:51.540
we live in pure ironclad

44:51.540 --> 44:53.540
oligarchies

44:53.540 --> 44:55.540
which require for legitimation purposes

44:55.540 --> 44:57.540
and for their reproduction

44:57.540 --> 44:59.540
that we think that we live in democracies

44:59.540 --> 45:01.540
now the tragedy is

45:01.540 --> 45:03.540
that capitalism

45:03.540 --> 45:05.540
is being overthrown

45:05.540 --> 45:07.540
not by the left

45:07.540 --> 45:09.540
we are useless

45:09.540 --> 45:11.540
progressives, left-wingers

45:11.540 --> 45:13.540
are a catastrophe

45:13.540 --> 45:15.540
has anybody seen

45:15.540 --> 45:17.540
the life of Brian, Monty Python's movie

45:17.540 --> 45:19.540
remember the opening scene

45:19.540 --> 45:21.540
when they all hate each other

45:21.540 --> 45:23.540
the Jews of

45:23.540 --> 45:25.540
the liberation front of Judea

45:25.540 --> 45:27.540
whose worst enemy is the liberation

45:27.540 --> 45:29.540
people's front of Judea

45:29.540 --> 45:31.540
that's the left

45:31.540 --> 45:33.540
we are

45:33.540 --> 45:35.540
sectarian, we hate each other

45:35.540 --> 45:37.540
more than we hate anything else

45:37.540 --> 45:39.540
but

45:39.540 --> 45:41.540
and when we did overthrow capitalism

45:41.540 --> 45:43.540
we created the gulag

45:43.540 --> 45:45.540
so we are a disaster

45:45.540 --> 45:47.540
doesn't mean we shouldn't

45:47.540 --> 45:49.540
try again to do it properly and democratically

45:49.540 --> 45:51.540
but

45:51.540 --> 45:53.540
let's face it capitalism is overthrowing itself

45:53.540 --> 45:55.540
with no help from us

45:55.540 --> 45:57.540
and it's doing it in two ways

45:57.540 --> 45:59.540
firstly

45:59.540 --> 46:01.540
think of 2008

46:01.540 --> 46:03.540
this financialization process

46:03.540 --> 46:05.540
that I described

46:05.540 --> 46:07.540
imploded under the weight

46:07.540 --> 46:09.540
of its own hubris

46:09.540 --> 46:11.540
and the result is a never-ending crisis

46:11.540 --> 46:13.540
don't believe anybody who tells you that the 2008 crisis ended

46:13.540 --> 46:15.540
it never ended

46:15.540 --> 46:17.540
it is continuing

46:17.540 --> 46:19.540
it is mutating

46:19.540 --> 46:21.540
it's stating different forms

46:21.540 --> 46:23.540
it migrates, it goes to different parts of the world

46:23.540 --> 46:25.540
it takes, for instance in Germany

46:25.540 --> 46:27.540
it takes the form of negative interest rates

46:27.540 --> 46:29.540
that are eating into the pension funds

46:29.540 --> 46:31.540
of the average middle-class person

46:31.540 --> 46:33.540
who then turns against the political system

46:33.540 --> 46:35.540
and votes for the fascists

46:35.540 --> 46:37.540
of the alternative for Deutschland

46:37.540 --> 46:39.540
they don't have an employment

46:39.540 --> 46:41.540
but they have this sense of deflation

46:41.540 --> 46:43.540
of their hard-earned savings

46:43.540 --> 46:45.540
that creates

46:45.540 --> 46:47.540
the rise of xenophobia, racism

46:47.540 --> 46:49.540
and the ultra-right

46:49.540 --> 46:51.540
in my country we have a Nazi party in parliament

46:51.540 --> 46:53.540
because we have a great depression

46:53.540 --> 46:55.540
because we have an employment rate

46:55.540 --> 46:57.540
of 30%

46:57.540 --> 46:59.540
and we have no interest rates

46:59.540 --> 47:01.540
because nobody is lending to anyone

47:01.540 --> 47:03.540
because everybody is bankrupt

47:03.540 --> 47:05.540
in China

47:05.540 --> 47:07.540
you have

47:07.540 --> 47:09.540
an investment rate

47:09.540 --> 47:11.540
the proportion of GDP

47:11.540 --> 47:13.540
of national income

47:13.540 --> 47:15.540
that goes into investment is gigantic

47:15.540 --> 47:17.540
it's 48%

47:17.540 --> 47:19.540
48 cents to every dollar

47:19.540 --> 47:21.540
earned in China

47:21.540 --> 47:23.540
goes into investment

47:23.540 --> 47:25.540
now investment is a good thing

47:25.540 --> 47:27.540
but our investment simply means

47:27.540 --> 47:29.540
that the Chinese authorities

47:29.540 --> 47:31.540
have given up on the West

47:31.540 --> 47:33.540
because let's face it

47:33.540 --> 47:35.540
the only reason why you don't have a great depression

47:35.540 --> 47:37.540
in this country today

47:37.540 --> 47:39.540
is because in 2008

47:39.540 --> 47:41.540
which was our version

47:41.540 --> 47:43.540
of 1929

47:43.540 --> 47:45.540
two things happened differently

47:45.540 --> 47:47.540
to what happened in 1929

47:47.540 --> 47:49.540
one was that the Federal Reserve started printing money

47:49.540 --> 47:51.540
as if there is no tomorrow

47:51.540 --> 47:53.540
didn't happen in 1929

47:53.540 --> 47:55.540
in order to rebalance global capitalism

47:55.540 --> 47:57.540
they did it very well

47:57.540 --> 47:59.540
but it's not sustainable

47:59.540 --> 48:01.540
so Europe is not sustainable

48:01.540 --> 48:03.540
China is not getting sustainable

48:03.540 --> 48:05.540
and the United States today

48:05.540 --> 48:07.540
which is celebrating growth

48:07.540 --> 48:09.540
what growth? you have 2.5% growth

48:09.540 --> 48:11.540
all the things that shouldn't grow grow

48:11.540 --> 48:13.540
the things that should grow are not growing

48:13.540 --> 48:15.540
you do not have

48:15.540 --> 48:17.540
any serious investment

48:17.540 --> 48:19.540
in good quality jobs in this country

48:19.540 --> 48:21.540
you have wage stagnation

48:21.540 --> 48:23.540
you have a situation

48:23.540 --> 48:25.540
people say oh it's

48:25.540 --> 48:27.540
this idiocy of the democratic party

48:27.540 --> 48:29.540
that put in one the election against Hillary Clinton

48:29.540 --> 48:31.540
come on wake up

48:31.540 --> 48:33.540
you cannot say to Trump voters

48:33.540 --> 48:35.540
that they're idiots

48:35.540 --> 48:37.540
and Putin duped them

48:37.540 --> 48:39.540
you can say that but then that's it

48:39.540 --> 48:41.540
you lose them forever

48:41.540 --> 48:43.540
and it's also not true

48:43.540 --> 48:45.540
people say to me how do you explain that Trump won

48:45.540 --> 48:47.540
I'm an economist so I look at numbers

48:47.540 --> 48:49.540
the number that I think is most spectacular

48:49.540 --> 48:51.540
in this country is that in 2016

48:53.540 --> 48:55.540
more than half of the families

48:55.540 --> 48:57.540
in this country could not afford

48:57.540 --> 48:59.540
the cheapest new car which cost 14000

48:59.540 --> 49:01.540
either they didn't have the money

49:01.540 --> 49:03.540
or they didn't have the money

49:03.540 --> 49:05.540
and they did not have the credit ratings

49:05.540 --> 49:07.540
necessary to borrow 14000

49:07.540 --> 49:09.540
more than half of the families cannot afford the cheapest car

49:09.540 --> 49:11.540
that's why Trump got elected

49:11.540 --> 49:13.540
because Obama failed

49:13.540 --> 49:15.540
spectacularly to shift

49:15.540 --> 49:17.540
the burdens of the crisis of the financial sector

49:17.540 --> 49:19.540
onto the 0.1%

49:21.540 --> 49:23.540
So

49:23.540 --> 49:25.540
I've spoken far too long

49:29.540 --> 49:31.540
let's end on a positive note

49:33.540 --> 49:35.540
Shall we?

49:35.540 --> 49:37.540
Technically

49:37.540 --> 49:39.540
it's really very simple

49:39.540 --> 49:41.540
how to solve the problem

49:41.540 --> 49:43.540
or how to begin a process

49:43.540 --> 49:45.540
we need a new deal

49:45.540 --> 49:47.540
except that this must be an international new deal

49:49.540 --> 49:51.540
exactly as the new deal was

49:51.540 --> 49:53.540
in 1933

49:53.540 --> 49:55.540
but globally

49:55.540 --> 49:57.540
that's not new

49:57.540 --> 49:59.540
Bretton Woods was an international new deal

49:59.540 --> 50:01.540
so we need a new Bretton Woods

50:01.540 --> 50:03.540
we need progressives in this country

50:03.540 --> 50:05.540
progressives in Europe

50:05.540 --> 50:07.540
to get an act together and start collaborating

50:07.540 --> 50:09.540
because you know the bankers are very good

50:09.540 --> 50:11.540
at being internationalists

50:11.540 --> 50:13.540
they love each other

50:13.540 --> 50:15.540
they love each other

50:15.540 --> 50:17.540
they have very good

50:17.540 --> 50:19.540
only we progressives

50:19.540 --> 50:21.540
fail to get together

50:21.540 --> 50:23.540
and start believing

50:23.540 --> 50:25.540
that it is possible to do that which

50:25.540 --> 50:27.540
has already been done before

50:27.540 --> 50:29.540
it's not buying the sky stuff

50:29.540 --> 50:31.540
now

50:31.540 --> 50:33.540
this in order to ameliorate the effects

50:33.540 --> 50:35.540
of the ongoing crisis after 2008

50:35.540 --> 50:37.540
the fact is that

50:37.540 --> 50:39.540
we need a new deal

50:39.540 --> 50:41.540
to ameliorate the effects of the ongoing crisis

50:41.540 --> 50:43.540
after 2008

50:43.540 --> 50:45.540
then once we stabilize the world

50:45.540 --> 50:47.540
like

50:47.540 --> 50:49.540
Bretton Woods stabilized the world after the Second World War

50:49.540 --> 50:51.540
then we can start

50:51.540 --> 50:53.540
thinking about postcapitalism

50:53.540 --> 50:55.540
because we must

50:55.540 --> 50:57.540
capitalism is over turning itself

50:57.540 --> 50:59.540
not only through its crisis

50:59.540 --> 51:01.540
but also through the technologies that it is creating

51:01.540 --> 51:03.540
3D printing

51:03.540 --> 51:05.540
artificial intelligence

51:05.540 --> 51:07.540
the internet

51:07.540 --> 51:09.540
there will be no need to have a corporation

51:09.540 --> 51:11.540
corporations will lack their zone

51:11.540 --> 51:13.540
the only reason why you have general models

51:13.540 --> 51:15.540
is the economies of scale

51:15.540 --> 51:17.540
economies of scale are dying because of the new technologies

51:17.540 --> 51:19.540
that capitalism is creating

51:19.540 --> 51:21.540
so you are going to have a situation

51:21.540 --> 51:23.540
in which

51:23.540 --> 51:25.540
we are going to have magnificent productivity

51:25.540 --> 51:27.540
magnificent

51:27.540 --> 51:29.540
capacity to produce stuff

51:29.540 --> 51:31.540
but the large majority

51:31.540 --> 51:33.540
will not be able to buy any of it

51:33.540 --> 51:35.540
so that will be a crisis of

51:35.540 --> 51:37.540
not just the poor

51:37.540 --> 51:39.540
but also the haves

51:39.540 --> 51:41.540
but we must never

51:41.540 --> 51:43.540
believe that because there is going to be a crisis of capitalism

51:43.540 --> 51:45.540
because capitalism is going to undermine

51:45.540 --> 51:47.540
and overthrow itself

51:47.540 --> 51:49.540
good things will happen

51:49.540 --> 51:51.540
in the 1930s

51:51.540 --> 51:53.540
capitalism imploded

51:53.540 --> 51:55.540
and Nazism happened

51:55.540 --> 51:57.540
so we can have

51:59.540 --> 52:01.540
one certainty

52:01.540 --> 52:03.540
capitalism cannot maintain itself

52:03.540 --> 52:05.540
something else

52:05.540 --> 52:07.540
another system of organizing

52:07.540 --> 52:09.540
economic and political life is going to follow

52:09.540 --> 52:11.540
and we better make sure

52:11.540 --> 52:13.540
that the way in which we choose

52:13.540 --> 52:15.540
as a species, as a humanity

52:15.540 --> 52:17.540
that different way

52:17.540 --> 52:19.540
of doing things is selected

52:19.540 --> 52:21.540
democratically because even though democracy

52:21.540 --> 52:23.540
takes too long

52:23.540 --> 52:25.540
as Oscar Wilde said socialism

52:25.540 --> 52:27.540
would never happen because it takes too many long evenings

52:29.540 --> 52:31.540
and it's tedious

52:31.540 --> 52:33.540
there's no doubt about that

52:33.540 --> 52:35.540
if you've been to a political meeting

52:35.540 --> 52:37.540
you know how tedious it is

52:37.540 --> 52:39.540
it's the only choice we have

52:39.540 --> 52:41.540
thankfully we are creating the technologies

52:41.540 --> 52:43.540
that will make these debates

52:43.540 --> 52:45.540
both more manageable

52:45.540 --> 52:47.540
and more hopeful in terms of

52:47.540 --> 52:49.540
delivering a future that resembles

52:49.540 --> 52:51.540
as I say in the book

52:51.540 --> 52:53.540
Star Trek and not the Matrix

52:53.540 --> 52:55.540
thank you

53:01.540 --> 53:03.540
You're a very interesting combination

53:03.540 --> 53:05.540
of idealism

53:05.540 --> 53:07.540
and pragmatism

53:07.540 --> 53:09.540
identified the problem

53:09.540 --> 53:11.540
that we have here

53:11.540 --> 53:13.540
which led to somehow

53:13.540 --> 53:15.540
Trump being elected

53:15.540 --> 53:17.540
yet

53:17.540 --> 53:19.540
that terrible inequality

53:19.540 --> 53:21.540
which has gotten way worse

53:21.540 --> 53:23.540
in the last 12 months

53:23.540 --> 53:25.540
and looks like it's going to get worse

53:25.540 --> 53:27.540
even more get worse again

53:27.540 --> 53:29.540
did not produce

53:29.540 --> 53:31.540
enough people to elect Bernie Sanders

53:33.540 --> 53:35.540
and I went to his rallies

53:35.540 --> 53:37.540
and he said great things

53:37.540 --> 53:39.540
do you think that this country

53:39.540 --> 53:41.540
just can't wrap its head around

53:41.540 --> 53:43.540
that word socialist

53:43.540 --> 53:45.540
and that's my question

53:45.540 --> 53:47.540
is does it have to repackage the thinking

53:49.540 --> 53:51.540
Well

53:51.540 --> 53:53.540
I used to think that

53:53.540 --> 53:55.540
until Bernie Sanders called himself a socialist

53:55.540 --> 53:57.540
and won the primary election

53:57.540 --> 53:59.540
they were stolen from him

53:59.540 --> 54:01.540
Bernie Sanders won the election

54:01.540 --> 54:03.540
or he would have won the election

54:03.540 --> 54:05.540
if the National Democratic Committee

54:05.540 --> 54:07.540
did not do its utmost

54:07.540 --> 54:09.540
to perform a coup d'etat against him

54:09.540 --> 54:11.540
and I'm stating this

54:11.540 --> 54:13.540
as an accusation

54:13.540 --> 54:15.540
the Democratic Party

54:15.540 --> 54:17.540
is its own worst enemy

54:19.540 --> 54:21.540
So given that

54:21.540 --> 54:23.540
this is the substrate that we have to work with

54:23.540 --> 54:25.540
how do we change the thinking

54:25.540 --> 54:27.540
if we want the things that that party

54:27.540 --> 54:29.540
is proposing

54:29.540 --> 54:31.540
how do we get

54:31.540 --> 54:33.540
the electorate to change their voting

54:33.540 --> 54:35.540
why did they vote for Trump

54:35.540 --> 54:37.540
why

54:37.540 --> 54:39.540
Well

54:39.540 --> 54:41.540
firstly

54:41.540 --> 54:43.540
the abstention rate was quite high

54:43.540 --> 54:45.540
a lot of good people

54:45.540 --> 54:47.540
could simply not bring themselves

54:47.540 --> 54:49.540
to vote for Hillary

54:49.540 --> 54:51.540
and they didn't vote at all

54:51.540 --> 54:53.540
and many others

54:53.540 --> 54:55.540
but

54:55.540 --> 54:57.540
I wasn't here during your election campaign

54:57.540 --> 54:59.540
but I was in Britain

54:59.540 --> 55:01.540
before the Brexit referendum

55:01.540 --> 55:03.540
and I believe that there are great similarities between the two

55:03.540 --> 55:05.540
and I remember I was campaigning against Brexit

55:05.540 --> 55:07.540
in Britain

55:07.540 --> 55:09.540
in the same way I would have campaigned against Trump here

55:09.540 --> 55:11.540
of course

55:11.540 --> 55:13.540
and I remember asking people

55:13.540 --> 55:15.540
who were

55:15.540 --> 55:17.540
not racist

55:17.540 --> 55:19.540
who were not xenophobic

55:19.540 --> 55:21.540
who were not right-wing

55:21.540 --> 55:23.540
why are you voting for Brexit

55:23.540 --> 55:25.540
and the answer had nothing to do with Europe

55:25.540 --> 55:27.540
the answer was this

55:27.540 --> 55:29.540
if I vote

55:29.540 --> 55:31.540
to remain

55:31.540 --> 55:33.540
in the European Union

55:33.540 --> 55:35.540
those bastards that have been treating me

55:35.540 --> 55:37.540
like a discarded

55:37.540 --> 55:39.540
piece of rag

55:39.540 --> 55:41.540
a discarded rag

55:41.540 --> 55:43.540
are going to be very happy

55:43.540 --> 55:45.540
so I'm going to cast my vote in a manner

55:45.540 --> 55:47.540
that maximizes the discomfort

55:47.540 --> 55:49.540
of those who have been treating me

55:49.540 --> 55:51.540
as if I'm not a human

55:51.540 --> 55:53.540
now

55:53.540 --> 55:55.540
I don't know

55:55.540 --> 55:57.540
you have to tell me whether this is

55:57.540 --> 55:59.540
an appropriate comparison

55:59.540 --> 56:01.540
to what was going on here

56:01.540 --> 56:03.540
a lot of people who voted for Trump

56:03.540 --> 56:05.540
simply wanted to punish the establishment

56:05.540 --> 56:07.540
and they wanted

56:07.540 --> 56:09.540
I think that there is quite a lot of supporting evidence

56:09.540 --> 56:11.540
of course there are racists

56:11.540 --> 56:13.540
and there are Nazis

56:13.540 --> 56:15.540
and there are right-wingers

56:15.540 --> 56:17.540
and bigots and misogynists who voted for Trump

56:17.540 --> 56:19.540
but they made the difference

56:19.540 --> 56:21.540
the ones who made the difference

56:21.540 --> 56:23.540
were the ones who could not afford the car

56:23.540 --> 56:25.540
the ones who had believed in Obama

56:25.540 --> 56:27.540
and who voted for Obama in 2008

56:27.540 --> 56:29.540
from what I'm reading at the data

56:29.540 --> 56:31.540
and there seems to be a very large number of voters

56:31.540 --> 56:33.540
who voted for Obama in 2008

56:33.540 --> 56:35.540
and Trump in 2016

56:35.540 --> 56:37.540
now that cannot be explained

56:37.540 --> 56:39.540
on the basis of racism

56:39.540 --> 56:41.540
it cannot be explained on the basis of

56:41.540 --> 56:43.540
misogyny

56:43.540 --> 56:45.540
it is simply

56:45.540 --> 56:47.540
to hell with you

56:47.540 --> 56:49.540
I am not going to vindicate

56:49.540 --> 56:51.540
yet again

56:51.540 --> 56:53.540
a presidential candidate

56:53.540 --> 56:55.540
who goes into Wall Street

56:55.540 --> 56:57.540
six months before the presidential election

56:57.540 --> 56:59.540
gives

56:59.540 --> 57:01.540
private speeches for hundreds of thousands

57:01.540 --> 57:03.540
of dollars

57:03.540 --> 57:05.540
and

57:05.540 --> 57:07.540
excuse the language

57:07.540 --> 57:09.540
shits on people like me

57:09.540 --> 57:11.540
in front of the bankers calling me names

57:11.540 --> 57:13.540
and promising to them

57:13.540 --> 57:15.540
that they will be allowed to continue doing that

57:15.540 --> 57:17.540
which has put us and our country

57:17.540 --> 57:19.540
in this position

57:21.540 --> 57:23.540
So, trying to be optimistic

57:23.540 --> 57:25.540
from a moment

57:25.540 --> 57:27.540
if we were trying to create

57:27.540 --> 57:29.540
some kind of apparatus

57:29.540 --> 57:31.540
I mean in the 50s

57:31.540 --> 57:33.540
Roosevelt did the very thing that they said was impossible

57:33.540 --> 57:35.540
he put 90% tax

57:35.540 --> 57:37.540
on corporate America

57:37.540 --> 57:39.540
to fund all these great schemes

57:39.540 --> 57:41.540
the social security system

57:41.540 --> 57:43.540
you know Medicare

57:43.540 --> 57:45.540
these things were made possible

57:45.540 --> 57:47.540
but the workers had unions then

57:47.540 --> 57:49.540
quite strong unions

57:49.540 --> 57:51.540
now that's all been taken away

57:51.540 --> 57:53.540
how are people going to

57:53.540 --> 57:55.540
organize and overthrow the system

57:55.540 --> 57:57.540
as you say

57:57.540 --> 57:59.540
I mean it may implode but in the interim

57:59.540 --> 58:01.540
people are just surviving on

58:01.540 --> 58:03.540
ten dollar an hour wages

58:03.540 --> 58:05.540
or not surviving

58:05.540 --> 58:07.540
so where is the impetus for evolution

58:07.540 --> 58:09.540
you do not need punitive tax rates now

58:09.540 --> 58:11.540
you don't need 90%

58:11.540 --> 58:13.540
this was a gimmick anyway

58:13.540 --> 58:15.540
No, but it worked

58:15.540 --> 58:17.540
Yeah, I mean it was more of a political stunt

58:17.540 --> 58:19.540
I don't believe that it is

58:19.540 --> 58:21.540
necessary to have such high tax rates

58:21.540 --> 58:23.540
but what you do need

58:23.540 --> 58:25.540
is you need to change the discourse

58:25.540 --> 58:27.540
in a way that appeals

58:27.540 --> 58:29.540
not only to those who would have joined

58:29.540 --> 58:31.540
trade unions but to people who would never

58:31.540 --> 58:33.540
have imagined themselves to be radical

58:33.540 --> 58:35.540
or even progressive

58:35.540 --> 58:37.540
So let me give you an example, take NAFTA

58:37.540 --> 58:39.540
there is a lot of discussion in this country

58:39.540 --> 58:41.540
now about NAFTA

58:41.540 --> 58:43.540
the liberal establishment says

58:43.540 --> 58:45.540
oh you know free trade is everything

58:45.540 --> 58:47.540
the pie is going to shrink

58:47.540 --> 58:49.540
if you do away with it

58:49.540 --> 58:51.540
but some people in

58:51.540 --> 58:53.540
the Rust Belt say

58:53.540 --> 58:55.540
well that's your pie, that's not my pie

58:55.540 --> 58:57.540
my pie has disappeared a long time ago

58:57.540 --> 58:59.540
so if I can manage to hold on to a few

58:59.540 --> 59:01.540
you know still workers jobs

59:01.540 --> 59:03.540
by means of tariffs

59:03.540 --> 59:05.540
let's do it because it's better

59:05.540 --> 59:07.540
than all of us being thrown into

59:07.540 --> 59:09.540
the dustbin

59:09.540 --> 59:11.540
why not change the narrative

59:11.540 --> 59:13.540
and to say

59:13.540 --> 59:15.540
yes we want to renegotiate NAFTA

59:17.540 --> 59:19.540
along the following lines

59:19.540 --> 59:21.540
if Mexico wants

59:21.540 --> 59:23.540
to continue to have

59:23.540 --> 59:25.540
or Mexican capitalists

59:25.540 --> 59:27.540
want to continue to have

59:27.540 --> 59:29.540
free access to the American market

59:29.540 --> 59:31.540
Mexico is going to have to introduce

59:31.540 --> 59:33.540
a minimum wage in Mexico

59:33.540 --> 59:35.540
but it provides a living wage

59:35.540 --> 59:37.540
by Mexican standards

59:37.540 --> 59:39.540
not by American standards

59:39.540 --> 59:41.540
to the workers who work in the factories

59:41.540 --> 59:43.540
that produces stuff that are then transported

59:43.540 --> 59:45.540
over to the United States

59:45.540 --> 59:47.540
now that is a progressive renegotiation

59:47.540 --> 59:49.540
of NAFTA

59:49.540 --> 59:51.540
not tariffs but minimum living wages

59:51.540 --> 59:53.540
in the poorer countries

59:53.540 --> 59:55.540
ok so that way

59:55.540 --> 59:57.540
not building a wall

59:57.540 --> 59:59.540
of course not building a wall

59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.540
but then you wouldn't need to bring it to build a wall

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.540
so that is one example

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:05.540
take for instance

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:07.540
the question about the health service here

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:09.540
the health system

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:11.540
well you don't have a health system

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.540
the absence of a health system

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.540
Obamacare was a complete disaster

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.540
Obamacare

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:19.540
is an affront against logic

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.540
the idea of universal cover

01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:25.540
is absolutely essential

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:27.540
but also the idea that

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.540
the state is going to be subsidizing

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.540
private companies to provide public health

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:33.540
without any controls

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:35.540
regarding the prices of the

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.540
services and the pharmaceuticals

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:39.540
is a catastrophe

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:41.540
it's like effectively

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.540
subsidizing the private insurance

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:45.540
this is why of course

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:47.540
they contributed massively to Obama's campaign

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:51.540
without the so called public option

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.540
it's ludicrous

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.540
so how about the following argument

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:57.540
about having

01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:59.540
a proper national health service

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.540
a public health service system

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:03.540
in the United States

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:05.540
so that we can introduce tax cuts

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.540
think about that

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:09.540
that would really throw the Republicans wouldn't it

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.540
because your tax

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:13.540
your health system

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.540
is the most expensive in the world

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:17.540
you pay twice as much on health

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:19.540
than the rest of the world

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:21.540
and you have far worse outcomes

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:23.540
so imagine that you created a proper public system

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.540
you'd save a huge amount of money

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:27.540
public money

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:29.540
and then you could give them

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:31.540
give them away as tax cuts

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:33.540
but why not also say that

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:35.540
those tax cuts will go to the lowest wage

01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:37.540
earners not to the top

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:39.540
so that's how you change the debate

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:41.540
you get out of the way

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:43.540
of the stereotype

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:45.540
that the Republicans are trying to create for you

01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:49.540
and you subvert the dominant way of thinking

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.540
So I would like to hug the questioning

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:53.540
but I don't think it's fair

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:55.540
because I'm sure there are lots of good questions

01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:57.540
that are going to come from the audience

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:59.540
so I'm going to open up the questions

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.540
and if you could confine it to one

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.540
I would be appreciative

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:05.540
It may be one and a half

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:07.540
I thought for a minute your talk was going to be almost entirely about Harvard

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:09.540
Marshall

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:11.540
who announced it at Harvard commencement

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:13.540
Kissinger

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:15.540
and then Larry Summers

01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.540
I'd say

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.540
have this idea that maybe Obama was

01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:21.540
put in the White House

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:23.540
to bail out Harvard

01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:25.540
that whose endowment went from

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:27.540
losing 11 billion to regaining it

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:31.540
I think many people in this country

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:33.540
are still not convinced

01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:35.540
that Obama did have a choice

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:37.540
Now you said

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.540
I believe that he did

01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:41.540
but can you be a little more specific about

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:43.540
and you sort of writ large

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:45.540
you talk about a new deal

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.540
but are you more specific about what

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.540
a person in the White House

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.540
could have done

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.540
what it would have looked like

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:55.540
that would have been more like bailing out Wall Street

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:57.540
more like bailing out Main Street

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.540
than bailing out Wall Street

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:01.540
and can you explain

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:03.540
why the social democratic politics

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:05.540
of building a politics

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:07.540
where we control the government

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:09.540
and regulate capitalism

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.540
is not the way to go

01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:13.540
but some other alternative politics

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.540
is what you're implying

01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.540
but you haven't really I don't think spelled out

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:19.540
Ok, I'll start from the second part

01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:21.540
Look

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:23.540
the new deal that I am suggesting

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:25.540
as a first step

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.540
is social democratic

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:29.540
but in the good old fashioned sense

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:31.540
of it

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:33.540
so you need social democratic measures

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:35.540
to stabilize the political economy

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:37.540
before we can have a genuine conversation

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:39.540
about what comes next

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:41.540
the more radical part

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:43.540
for instance changing corporate law

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:45.540
I mean corporate law

01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:47.540
is a political value judgment

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:49.540
so when some corporation

01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:51.540
goes bust

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.540
who gets paid first

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.540
amongst the creditors

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.540
is a political decision

01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:59.540
so why not change it

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:01.540
why have the bankers get paid first

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:03.540
and the workers last

01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:05.540
why allow people to own shares

01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:07.540
in a company in which they don't work

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:09.540
this is very radical I don't know

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.540
where you can only have shares in a company

01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:13.540
in which you actually provide labor

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:15.540
then you have socialism

01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:17.540
but without state control

01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:19.540
so that's the second

01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:21.540
part of the second question

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:23.540
but let's go back to Obama, did he have a choice

01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:25.540
of course he had a choice

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:27.540
he could have appointed as

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.540
instead of appointing

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:31.540
team guide there and Larry Summers

01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:33.540
he could have appointed Elizabeth Warren

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:35.540
with a mandate

01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:37.540
to save the banks

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:39.540
or operate the bankers

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:41.540
which is not a new idea

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.540
in 1992

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.540
the Swedish banks

01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:47.540
actually all the Scandinavian banks went bust

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:49.540
and what the governments did then

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:51.540
was to say to the bankers ok, out

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:53.540
they took over the banks, they nationalized them

01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:55.540
put in a new board of directors

01:04:55.540 --> 01:04:57.540
and within two years

01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.540
they had sold them back to the private sector

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:01.540
but cleansed, the original bankers had gone

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:03.540
with new regulations

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.540
he didn't do that

01:05:05.540 --> 01:05:07.540
he left Jamie Dimon

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:09.540
Goldman Sachs

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:11.540
intact all the structures of power

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:13.540
in 2009

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.540
when he moved into the White House

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:17.540
for about six to eight months

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:19.540
I grant you

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:21.540
not more than that

01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:23.540
he had a window of opportunity

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:25.540
he had a whole nation behind him

01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.540
he could have done that

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:29.540
even libertarians would have approved

01:05:29.540 --> 01:05:31.540
of expropriating the bankers

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:33.540
he didn't

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.540
but it was him

01:05:35.540 --> 01:05:37.540
to create the so called

01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:39.540
Summers Geithner plan

01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:41.540
if you haven't studied that

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:43.540
go and study it

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.540
it is a remarkable

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:47.540
ingenious way

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.540
of

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:51.540
conjuring up

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.540
around nine trillion dollars

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:55.540
and giving it to the bankers without anybody realizing it

01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:59.540
you remember the bailout that Hank Paulson came up with

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:01.540
was 700 billion

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.540
initially he was defeated

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:05.540
in congress

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:07.540
and then he managed to push it through

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:09.540
700 billion spinnets

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.540
Geithner and Summers

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:13.540
created nine trillion

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:15.540
without anybody realizing it

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:17.540
ok

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.540
so Obama had a choice to do it

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.540
and he did it

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:23.540
now we are paying for it

01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:25.540
because Trump is president

01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.540
I've been very concerned

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.540
lately about China

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:33.540
and sort of there

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:35.540
we have transferred so much money

01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:37.540
from our economy

01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:39.540
over to China

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:41.540
by buying all those things

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:43.540
and supporting their economy over there

01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:45.540
so they could make more and more money

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.540
they are now all over

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:49.540
Africa

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.540
buying things and

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.540
investing over there

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:55.540
and getting those countries dependent on them

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:57.540
and supporting

01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.540
these democratic people

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:01.540
and I'm just wondering

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:03.540
like whom

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.540
we are in a country that supports Saudi Arabia

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:07.540
yes that's true

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:09.540
suddenly we have a problem

01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:11.540
with

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:13.540
superpowers supporting non-democratic people

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:17.540
yes I mean yes I do

01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:19.540
but I also am concerned

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.540
that we've sort of created

01:07:21.540 --> 01:07:23.540
the economic power that China

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.540
sort of has now and they are using it

01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:27.540
I fear

01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:29.540
I'm going to be using it against us eventually

01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:31.540
and against

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:33.540
the better interests of a lot of people

01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:35.540
allow me to put your mind to rest

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.540
you shouldn't worry about that

01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:39.540
ok

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:41.540
very simple

01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:43.540
and let me explain why you shouldn't worry about that

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:45.540
but please continue

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:47.540
I mean

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:51.540
you know

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:53.540
they are in Africa

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.540
they are making money to countries to build ports

01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:57.540
and different infrastructure

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:59.540
and what's wrong with that

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.540
countries that need ports

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:03.540
get ports

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:05.540
but they are making people dependent on

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.540
I mean I know it's the same thing that we've done

01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:09.540
which is affordable around the world

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:11.540
they are far more humanistic

01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:13.540
than the United States ever was

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.540
really? ok

01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:17.540
let me give you an example

01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:19.540
of course they are peddling

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:21.540
for influence

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:23.540
but they are non-interventionists

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:25.540
absolutely non-interventionists

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:27.540
in a way that Europeans

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.540
the West has never managed to fathom

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.540
but I have a feeling

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:33.540
they have a longer term thought process

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.540
that is more

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.540
but let's judge what we see

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:39.540
let's start at the beginning

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.540
the Chinese never asked Apple

01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:47.540
to go to Shenzhen

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.540
produce all the iPhones

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:51.540
because Steve Jobs have decided that

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.540
it was not China

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:57.540
that

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.540
went to Washington DC

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:03.540
and demanded

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.540
that they buy a third of your national debt

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:09.540
if they hadn't bought it

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.540
you would be in serious trouble

01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:13.540
number three

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:15.540
I did allude to this

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:17.540
in my talk

01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:19.540
in 2008 China had not cranked up

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.540
their credit bubble

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:23.540
you would be in a great depression

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:25.540
now

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.540
so China

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.540
the United States and the European Union

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.540
are absolutely

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:33.540
synergistic

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:35.540
and they need one another

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:37.540
in a way that

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.540
if we

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:41.540
failed to acknowledge and to nurture

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:45.540
billions of people

01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:47.540
including

01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:49.540
the majority of the people in this country

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.540
are going to suffer

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.540
now

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:55.540
I am not going to stand here

01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:57.540
and defend China

01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.540
and the Chinese Communist Party

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.540
I already made some negative remarks

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.540
about the Chinese Communist Party

01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:05.540
in referring to

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.540
their attitudes as being

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:09.540
compatible

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:11.540
with those of Wolfgang Schroeble

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.540
my concern about China

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:15.540
is the

01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:17.540
authoritarian manner

01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:19.540
in which the Chinese regime

01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:21.540
is treating the Chinese people

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:23.540
as a democrat, I have a problem with this

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.540
mind you

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:27.540
I have to tell you that

01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:29.540
from my understanding of China

01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:31.540
it's a very interesting social experiment

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:33.540
in the sense that

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:35.540
at the local level

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:37.540
the regional level

01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:39.540
you now have a boisterous democracy

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:41.540
at the local and regional level

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:43.540
even with

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:45.540
popular

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:47.540
success stories in overthrowing

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:49.540
local

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:51.540
authorities, local

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.540
bureaucrats who have been corrupt

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:55.540
who have been this, who have been that, who have been the other

01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:59.540
when it comes to the

01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.540
influence of China outside

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:03.540
its borders, I have to say

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:05.540
firstly, it's quite remarkable that they

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:07.540
don't seem to have any military

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:09.540
ambitions

01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.540
secondly

01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:13.540
Africa

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.540
I'll give you an example

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:17.540
a specific example

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.540
Ethiopia

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:21.540
2004, because it happened to be there

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.540
and I have some

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:25.540
first-person

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:27.540
first-hand experience of it

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:29.540
they went into Ethiopia

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:31.540
I'll tell you why they went into Ethiopia

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:33.540
because they suspected it was oil

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.540
because China is

01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:37.540
a major industrial power

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.540
but it lacks primary resources

01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.540
now, instead of going

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.540
into Africa with troops

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.540
colonially destroying the country

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:47.540
killing people like the west has done

01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:49.540
for the last 100 years

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.540
what they did was, they went to

01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:53.540
Adithababa and they said to the government

01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:55.540
we would like, we can see

01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.540
you have problems with your infrastructure

01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:59.540
we would like to build some new airports

01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:03.540
upgrade your railway system

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:05.540
create a telephone system

01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:07.540
and rebuild your roads

01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.540
and we'll do this all for free

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.540
no strings attached, we don't want

01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:13.540
anything from you

01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:15.540
and they did, why did they do it?

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:17.540
because it's soft power

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:19.540
now, because they knew

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.540
that if oil is

01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:23.540
discovered, and it was discovered later

01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:25.540
then

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:27.540
of course, the Ethiopian government

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:29.540
will be much more open to Chinese

01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:31.540
oil companies coming there

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:33.540
they have never combined

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:35.540
their investment

01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.540
with imperialistic

01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:41.540
when I was minister of finance

01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.540
I had a very interesting

01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:45.540
experience with Costco

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.540
one of the Chinese national companies

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.540
that in the end bought the port of Piraeus

01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:55.540
when I moved into the ministry

01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:57.540
I found a contract

01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:59.540
from the previous government

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:01.540
the port of Piraeus

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:03.540
for a pittance and other ridiculous conditions

01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:05.540
to the Chinese

01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:07.540
under the guidance

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.540
of course of the European Union and International Monetary Fund

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:11.540
as well

01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.540
and in other ways I was

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.540
as a minister I was

01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:17.540
bound to a particular

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.540
deal that was terrible for Greece

01:13:19.540 --> 01:13:21.540
and I went to the Chinese

01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.540
and discussed it with them

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:25.540
and I was really astonished

01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:27.540
I said to them look, you're paying too little

01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:29.540
you're not committing to a sufficient

01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:31.540
level of investment

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.540
and you are treating our workers

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:35.540
as fodder

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.540
you are effectively subcontracting labor

01:13:37.540 --> 01:13:39.540
to horrible companies

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.540
that exploit the workers

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:43.540
and I can't deal with this

01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:45.540
effectively

01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:47.540
I proposed to them

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:49.540
to renegotiate the contract

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.540
so instead of getting 67% of the shares

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.540
of the port they would get with the same price

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:55.540
51%

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:57.540
the remaining shares would go into

01:13:57.540 --> 01:13:59.540
the Greek pension fund system

01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:01.540
in order to bolster

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:03.540
the capitalization of the public pensions

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:05.540
secondly

01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:07.540
I want you to commit

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.540
to 180 million euros

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:11.540
of investment within 12 months

01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:13.540
and thirdly

01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.540
proper collective bargaining with the trade unions

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:17.540
and no subcontracting of labor

01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:19.540
and to my astonishment

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.540
they said ok

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:23.540
can you imagine if that was a German company

01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:25.540
or an American company

01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:27.540
that's what I'm saying, I don't think you should worry

01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:29.540
ok, I won't

01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:37.540
hi

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.540
hi, big fan Janis

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:41.540
nice to see you in person

01:14:41.540 --> 01:14:43.540
and I hope you don't mind that I'll struggle

01:14:43.540 --> 01:14:45.540
to give you a short question

01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:47.540
instead of an essay

01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:49.540
so basically

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:51.540
one angle that

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.540
was missing from tonight's talk

01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:55.540
is the angle of

01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:57.540
class formations

01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.540
so the new deal was born out of

01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:01.540
I believe

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.540
about easily 50-60 years

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.540
of left wing organizing

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:07.540
among the industrial working classes

01:15:07.540 --> 01:15:09.540
who basically

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:11.540
as we would always say on our slogans

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:13.540
had their hands on the wheels

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:15.540
when they went on strike they could stop production

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.540
stop the flow of profits

01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:19.540
and so on and so on

01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:21.540
by the time the Great Depression came

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.540
there was a crisis

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:25.540
there was a place for labor

01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.540
and the left at the bargaining table

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:29.540
I guess

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:31.540
what I want to ask is

01:15:31.540 --> 01:15:33.540
let's take neoliberalism at a kind of good faith

01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:35.540
and say there really was a change

01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:37.540
in the class formation

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:39.540
that allowed them to just throw out Bretton Woods

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:41.540
and say we don't want to commit to this deal anymore

01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:43.540
you don't have the power

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:45.540
effectively your bargaining terms

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.540
oh laborers are not so good anymore

01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.540
so then

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:51.540
that leaves us today

01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:53.540
where are we

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:55.540
who does have their hands on the wheel

01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:57.540
I mean

01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:59.540
here we are Cambridge, Massachusetts

01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:01.540
large portion of the population works in

01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:03.540
white collar professions

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.540
many of them are homeowners

01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:07.540
in traditional

01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:09.540
there aren't a lot of traditional industrial workers

01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:11.540
in this room

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:13.540
on the other hand the traditional industrial workers

01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:15.540
in Ohio or wherever

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:17.540
are losing their jobs quite rapidly

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:19.540
due to mechanization

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:21.540
and offshoring

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:23.540
so

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:25.540
who can put the worker's gun

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:27.540
to the capitalist class's head anymore

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:31.540
good question

01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:33.540
but I have to disagree with you on one thing

01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:35.540
and sorry to sound a bit tanky on you

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:37.540
no no no you're not tanky

01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:39.540
it is the pertinent question

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:41.540
the one you asked

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:43.540
I don't have a

01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:45.540
splendid answer to it

01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.540
but where I want to disagree with you

01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:49.540
is that in 1933

01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.540
or 32

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.540
it was the labor movement

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:55.540
that imposed

01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:57.540
its will using its power

01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:59.540
there was no power

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:01.540
the 1929 great

01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:03.540
the great crash and then the depression that followed

01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:05.540
completely depleted

01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:07.540
trade unions of any bargaining power

01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.540
when you have a situation

01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:11.540
where you've got hordes of people

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:13.540
outside the factory gates

01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:15.540
begging to be allowed into work

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:17.540
at any wage

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:19.540
you don't have trade union power

01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:21.540
so it was a political process

01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:23.540
that led

01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:25.540
not a labor process

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:27.540
that led to the new deal

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:29.540
and let's not forget that FDR was not a revolutionary leader

01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:31.540
he was a patrician

01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:33.540
he was a bourgeois

01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:35.540
even Keynes

01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:37.540
but Keynes

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:39.540
Keynes hated the workers

01:17:39.540 --> 01:17:41.540
trade unions

01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:43.540
the reason why he introduced Keynesian economics

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:45.540
his proposals

01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:47.540
which included increasing wages

01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:49.540
and welfare states

01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:51.540
and

01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:53.540
fiscal spending

01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:55.540
fiscal stimulus and so on

01:17:55.540 --> 01:17:57.540
was very simple

01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:59.540
he wanted to preserve capitalism

01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:01.540
and he understood that capitalism was not very good at preserving itself

01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:03.540
that's a very large part

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:05.540
of the motivation of Roosevelt

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:07.540
it was not that he was being pushed

01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:09.540
by the industrial might

01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:11.540
of the labor unions

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:13.540
so that gives you a bit of hope

01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:15.540
since that didn't happen then

01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:17.540
maybe we don't need

01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:19.540
strong trade unions today

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:21.540
today I think that

01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.540
from a class formation point of view

01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:25.540
what is me

01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:27.540
and what I think is the

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:29.540
the

01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:31.540
should be the objective

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.540
is how to organize

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:35.540
the precariat

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:37.540
those who live precarious existence

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:39.540
the uberized workers

01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:41.540
into a political force

01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:43.540
because they now are

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:45.540
falling through the cracks of society

01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:47.540
they are like the lumpenproletariat used to be

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:49.540
they are disappearing

01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:51.540
I mean

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:53.540
a person who works

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:55.540
18 hours a day in an uber

01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:57.540
is not a person

01:18:57.540 --> 01:18:59.540
it's a lost soul

01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:01.540
it's a moving

01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.540
monument to

01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.540
to misanthropy

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.540
so that for me

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.540
is a major question

01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:11.540
but

01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:13.540
allow me just to be

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:15.540
to shift in towards

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:17.540
something that may sound science fiction

01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:19.540
but I don't think it is

01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:21.540
we need to think

01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:25.540
innovatively about collective action

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.540
I do not believe

01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:29.540
that the revolution is going to come through trade unions

01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:31.540
in industrial sites

01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:33.540
but simply because they are fading

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:35.540
unless the robots organize

01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.540
and they do the revolution on our behalf

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:39.540
you never know

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:41.540
I've read the science fiction novel

01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:43.540
where the computer in the end

01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:45.540
organized the revolution

01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:49.540
but

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:51.540
let me give you an example

01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:53.540
today you have

01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:55.540
millions of people

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:57.540
who are being exploited

01:19:57.540 --> 01:19:59.540
by public utility companies

01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:01.540
being privatized

01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:03.540
and which are financialized

01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:05.540
and they have already

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:07.540
sold to financiers

01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:09.540
the next 20 years

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:11.540
of the electricity bills that you will be paying

01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:13.540
and as a result

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:15.540
of this financialization

01:20:15.540 --> 01:20:17.540
your bill is going up and up and up

01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:19.540
completely disproportionately to the cost

01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:21.540
of producing electricity, water, whatever

01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:23.540
what if

01:20:23.540 --> 01:20:25.540
we could work out

01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:27.540
which financial derivatives

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:29.540
or CDOs

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:33.540
are packaging

01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:35.540
the bills in a particular neighborhood

01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:37.540
and another neighborhood

01:20:37.540 --> 01:20:39.540
and we organize through the internet

01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:41.540
so that we can have

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:43.540
an electricity bill payment strike

01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:45.540
that is timed in such a way

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.540
as to explode those CDOs

01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.540
and make them bankrupt

01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:51.540
now that's a form of collective action

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:53.540
which is using the financial instruments

01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:55.540
of

01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:57.540
this kind of network

01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:59.540
against it

01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:01.540
we need to think beyond

01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:03.540
modern times Charlie Chaplin

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:05.540
thank you very much

01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:07.540
very interesting stuff

01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:09.540
Kelly Spetta

01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:11.540
that's all the Greek I know

01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:13.540
so

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:15.540
I originally

01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:17.540
tried to do a PhD on

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.540
the topic you talked

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:21.540
about the separation between

01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:23.540
political power and economic power

01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:25.540
specifically about the European Union

01:21:25.540 --> 01:21:27.540
and how it sort of formalized

01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:29.540
this split between the political spheres

01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:31.540
no longer has to do anything

01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:33.540
with what the people want

01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:35.540
with the economic organization

01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:37.540
no one wanted to touch that one with the 10 foot pole

01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:39.540
so I'm doing something else now

01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:41.540
but it made my passion

01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:43.540
but to keep the question reasonably short

01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:45.540
what is the one change

01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:47.540
one of the many changes you'd like to see

01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:49.540
in the structure of the European Union

01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:51.540
that could address this

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:53.540
right well

01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:55.540
I'll be very

01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:57.540
brief in my response

01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:59.540
we need to federate

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.540
because there are only two choices here

01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:03.540
either we break it up

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:05.540
which many people want

01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:07.540
even on the left

01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:09.540
thinking that

01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:11.540
recoiling into the bosom of the nation state

01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:13.540
is somehow going to allow them

01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:15.540
to create socialism in one country

01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:17.540
yeah right

01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:19.540
yeah

01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:21.540
but you have to create

01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:23.540
a democratic union

01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:25.540
now the problem is

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.540
that with this crisis

01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:29.540
that we have which is both

01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:31.540
economic and political

01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:33.540
and moral if you want

01:22:33.540 --> 01:22:35.540
we can't have a serious discussion

01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:37.540
about federation

01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:39.540
because we have centrifugal forces

01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:41.540
that are pulling us apart

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:43.540
so this is why our movement

01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:45.540
you may have heard of a movement

01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:47.540
that I'm part of, DM25

01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:49.540
proposing what we call a European New Deal

01:22:49.540 --> 01:22:51.540
a new deal

01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:53.540
in order to stabilize

01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:55.540
and bring hope back so that we can have a discussion

01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:57.540
on how to federate

01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:59.540
thank you very much

01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:01.540
I'm also going to ask

01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:03.540
a question about the European Union

01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:05.540
and about Greece

01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:07.540
and about

01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:09.540
the immigration problem

01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:11.540
which is all the more

01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:13.540
on everyone's mind

01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:15.540
because of everyone's

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:17.540
because of what Trump has just done

01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:19.540
with wiping out

01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:21.540
the

01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.540
agreement

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:25.540
on

01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:27.540
the Iranian

01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:29.540
nuclear situation

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:31.540
I

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:33.540
recently read

01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:35.540
that on the island of Lesbos

01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:37.540
I believe

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:39.540
which is an island that receives

01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:41.540
a lot of the

01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:43.540
immigrants from the Middle East, Syria

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:45.540
that Greeks

01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:47.540
were attacking

01:23:47.540 --> 01:23:49.540
the immigrants

01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:51.540
and I read

01:23:51.540 --> 01:23:53.540
that

01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:55.540
I have read

01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:57.540
for years now that conditions

01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:59.540
in the camps are terrible

01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:01.540
and something

01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:03.540
that I have wondered about

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.540
for years is

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:07.540
why is it

01:24:07.540 --> 01:24:09.540
the immigrants from

01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:11.540
the Middle East and North Africa

01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:13.540
coming to the south

01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:15.540
of Europe

01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:17.540
the poorest part of Europe

01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:19.540
and

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:21.540
why is it that there is not

01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.540
some common effort

01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:25.540
perhaps this is a very naive question

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:27.540
but some common effort

01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:29.540
to subsidize

01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:31.540
countries like Greece

01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:33.540
which is in

01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:35.540
terrible economic straits

01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:37.540
to deal

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:39.540
more humanely

01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:41.540
with these people

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.540
that's a fantastic question

01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:45.540
ok let's

01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:47.540
let me answer in three parts

01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:49.540
firstly inform you about what's going on in Lesbos

01:24:49.540 --> 01:24:51.540
because Lesbos is very

01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:53.540
dear to us

01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:55.540
as Greeks to our hearts

01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:57.540
and we are

01:24:57.540 --> 01:24:59.540
devastated by what's going on

01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:01.540
firstly let me be

01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:03.540
fair to the people of Lesbos

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:05.540
the vast majority of the people of Lesbos

01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:07.540
have been magnificent

01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:09.540
for three years now

01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:11.540
it's an island that is very depressed

01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.540
financially economically

01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:15.540
it's a bit like Detroit

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:17.540
and you have a million people

01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:19.540
it's an island of 17,000 people

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:21.540
and a million people came

01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:23.540
and most of them passed through

01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:25.540
now we have 50,000 left

01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:27.540
and they went on the shore

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:29.540
they picked them up

01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:31.540
they opened their houses

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:33.540
they opened their shops and gave them food

01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:35.540
of course for no money and so on

01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:37.540
but the vast majority

01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:39.540
of course when you have a combination

01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:41.540
of

01:25:41.540 --> 01:25:43.540
the great depression that we have

01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:45.540
in Greece you have Nazis

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.540
and add to this

01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:49.540
the European Union's

01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:51.540
attitude

01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:53.540
which is effective to turn Lesbos into a concentration camp

01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:55.540
and the people of

01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:57.540
the Greeks who live there

01:25:57.540 --> 01:25:59.540
then become very susceptible

01:25:59.540 --> 01:26:01.540
to the toxic narrative of the Greek Nazis

01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:03.540
who say to them see

01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:05.540
these bastards came here

01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:07.540
and now we are

01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:09.540
instead of being a beautiful Greek

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:11.540
a Greek island receiving tourists

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:13.540
and doing well

01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:15.540
we are ourselves part of a concentration camp

01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:17.540
so it's very difficult to fight against this narrative

01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:19.540
but

01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:21.540
to tell you what I think

01:26:21.540 --> 01:26:23.540
so

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:25.540
the situation on the ground

01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:27.540
there are three camps

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:29.540
one is called Moria

01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:31.540
it is the most notorious one

01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:33.540
a camp that can hold

01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:35.540
under reasonable conditions

01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:37.540
not good but the reasonable

01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:39.540
2,000 people there are 10,000 people

01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:41.540
so they live in

01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:43.540
circumstances that do not

01:26:43.540 --> 01:26:45.540
be fit a civilized

01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:47.540
part of the world

01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:49.540
but that's on purpose

01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:51.540
it is run by the European Union

01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:53.540
and the United Nations

01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:55.540
and it is

01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:57.540
accessible of misery

01:26:57.540 --> 01:26:59.540
on purpose

01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:01.540
from coming

01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:03.540
there are another two camps

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:05.540
that local NGOs have created

01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:07.540
and they are magnificent

01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:09.540
they are absolutely magnificent

01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:11.540
if you look at the circumstances

01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:13.540
in there

01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:15.540
the problem they have

01:27:15.540 --> 01:27:17.540
is that they don't have much capacity

01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:19.540
so there are 300 families in one

01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:21.540
and 110 families in the other

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:23.540
but they live

01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:25.540
it's actually quite heartwarming to see

01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:27.540
of course the problem is

01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:29.540
that none of these people

01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:31.540
have any kind of

01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:33.540
guarantee

01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:35.540
of safety

01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:37.540
I was talking to activists in the good camps

01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:39.540
who

01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:41.540
educate them

01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:43.540
teach them English

01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:45.540
their own language because they have kids

01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:47.540
who speak Farsi

01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:49.540
Persian

01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:51.540
and they teach them computing

01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:53.540
and they put a lot of effort in it

01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:55.540
and it's really heartwarming

01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:57.540
but they say to me

01:27:57.540 --> 01:27:59.540
do you know the tragedy

01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:01.540
of not knowing what's going to happen

01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:03.540
tomorrow morning because the police may come in

01:28:03.540 --> 01:28:05.540
grab one of them

01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:07.540
put them in chains throw them on the boat

01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:09.540
back to Turkey

01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:11.540
so you have no idea is this kid

01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:13.540
you have a 12 year old kid there

01:28:13.540 --> 01:28:15.540
and his or her parents

01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:17.540
are they going to be with us for a week

01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:19.540
2 weeks

01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:21.540
6 months 2 years

01:28:21.540 --> 01:28:23.540
the refugees don't know

01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:25.540
their lives

01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:27.540
the activists don't know

01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:29.540
so what do you teach them

01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:31.540
you teach very differently if you teach somebody for 2 weeks

01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:33.540
compared to if you know you would be teaching them for 2 years

01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:35.540
the curriculum is different

01:28:35.540 --> 01:28:37.540
and the local community

01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:39.540
doesn't even know

01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:41.540
is this camp here going to be permanent

01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:43.540
are we going to assimilate them

01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:45.540
are we going to live with these people forever

01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:47.540
because the local community will react differently

01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:49.540
if they knew that

01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.540
and with some support from them

01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:53.540
and the worst part is

01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:55.540
that

01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:57.540
you know

01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:59.540
the reason why I left the ministry

01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:01.540
was because my party

01:29:01.540 --> 01:29:03.540
and my prime minister capitulated

01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:05.540
to the

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.540
loan agreement

01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:09.540
but immediately after that capitulation

01:29:09.540 --> 01:29:11.540
that's what usually happens

01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:13.540
if you capitulate on one big thing

01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:15.540
then you capitulate on everything

01:29:15.540 --> 01:29:17.540
after that he also capitulated and signed

01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:19.540
the European Union Treaty with Turkey

01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:21.540
and a front

01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:23.540
to civilization

01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:25.540
because what we are doing is we are effectively

01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:27.540
the west

01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:29.540
civilized Europe

01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:31.540
we are bribing an increasingly

01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:33.540
dictatorial president of Turkey

01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:35.540
to the tune of some like 7 billion

01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:37.540
dollars

01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:39.540
so that he allows us

01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.540
to violate international law on refugees

01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:43.540
you know according to international law of refugees

01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:45.540
refugees

01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:47.540
people coming to your country have the right

01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:49.540
by international law

01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:51.540
to a hearing

01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:53.540
that will determine whether they are political refugees

01:29:53.540 --> 01:29:55.540
or not

01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:57.540
they don't have that right on lesbos

01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:59.540
because

01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:01.540
the EU-Turkey treaty has deemed

01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:03.540
that Turkey is a safe country

01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:05.540
so that

01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:07.540
when you arrive on lesbos

01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:09.540
you are not granted an interview

01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:11.540
as to whether you've been persecuted by the Syrian regime

01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:13.540
by the Taliban

01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:15.540
by I don't know whom

01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:17.540
but if you are kept there

01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:19.540
for an indefinite period

01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:21.540
you are not allowed to go to the rest of Greece

01:30:21.540 --> 01:30:23.540
you can wander around like a lost soul in lesbos

01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:25.540
but of course you live in the camp

01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:27.540
because there is nowhere else to live

01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:29.540
where are you going to live on the beach

01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:31.540
so it's

01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:33.540
purely horrible but

01:30:33.540 --> 01:30:35.540
let's just

01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:37.540
take a broader look at that situation

01:30:37.540 --> 01:30:39.540
you said the immigration problem

01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:41.540
I don't see that why

01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:43.540
that immigration is a problem

01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:45.540
but it's a great asset

01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:47.540
from a European perspective

01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:49.540
for a thousand years

01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:51.540
we have been populating the earth

01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:53.540
we're Europeans

01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:55.540
we've been sending our ships

01:30:55.540 --> 01:30:57.540
and our caravans

01:30:57.540 --> 01:30:59.540
to the Americas

01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:01.540
to Australia, to New Zealand

01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:03.540
we destroyed all the indigenous people in the world

01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:05.540
in Africa we colonized

01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:07.540
we created the new world

01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:09.540
that's what we did

01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:11.540
and we thought it was alright

01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:13.540
but we're aging

01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:15.540
we're becoming a sad aged lot

01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:17.540
yeah

01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:19.540
and the demographic dynamics

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:21.540
are reversing

01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:23.540
and we need these people

01:31:23.540 --> 01:31:25.540
we really need these people

01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:27.540
Germany is being depleted

01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:29.540
it's becoming another Japan

01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:31.540
Greece too, we have an economic crisis as well

01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:33.540
you know

01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:35.540
we are in a process of desertification

01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:37.540
so we need these people

01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:39.540
instead of

01:31:39.540 --> 01:31:41.540
treating migration

01:31:41.540 --> 01:31:43.540
immigration as an asset

01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:45.540
that we must collectively

01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:47.540
manage

01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:49.540
and find ways

01:31:49.540 --> 01:31:51.540
of making it work for us Europeans

01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:53.540
we are looking at it as a threat

01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:55.540
and we are trying to imagine

01:31:55.540 --> 01:31:57.540
a huge wall

01:31:57.540 --> 01:31:59.540
Trump-like

01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:01.540
going through the Mediterranean

01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:03.540
the North Pole, I don't know what they are going to do

01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:05.540
it's pathetic

01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:07.540
it's just a complete failure of the imagination

01:32:07.540 --> 01:32:09.540
and the result of course is

01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:11.540
that the builder

01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:13.540
the taller

01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:15.540
and more

01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:17.540
impenderable the wall that we create

01:32:17.540 --> 01:32:19.540
the only thing that changes

01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:21.540
is more deaths

01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:23.540
and greater profits for the traffickers

01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:25.540
it doesn't stop immigration

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:27.540
all it does it creates insecurity

01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:29.540
both in the local population

01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:31.540
and in the migrant population

01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:33.540
and profits for the traffickers

01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:35.540
so

01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:37.540
let them in

01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:41.540
and impose minimum wages

01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:43.540
living wages

01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:45.540
in the countries of their origin

01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:47.540
and if the countries cannot provide them

01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:49.540
help them provide them

01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:51.540
that's the solution

01:32:51.540 --> 01:32:53.540
not walls

01:32:53.540 --> 01:32:55.540
I can't help but notice

01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:57.540
that we are talking about the continuum of capitalism

01:32:57.540 --> 01:32:59.540
while we overlook a graveyard

01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:03.540
my understanding

01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:05.540
but one might be wrong

01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:07.540
is that we are paying approximately

01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.540
8 trillion dollars for the wars

01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:11.540
in interest

01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:13.540
for the wars?

01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:15.540
for the wars US

01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:17.540
how does an economy

01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:19.540
overcome that

01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:21.540
and how does that play out

01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:23.540
8 trillion in interest

01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:25.540
per year

01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:27.540
it's not 8 trillion per year

01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:29.540
it's not

01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:31.540
no

01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:33.540
but what is your general concern

01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:35.540
that we pay too much for what

01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:37.540
for the dead

01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:39.540
no, I'm talking about the wars, just the wars

01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:41.540
let me tell you

01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:43.540
maybe it's 8 billion but not 8 trillion

01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:45.540
ok, then my figures are wrong

01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:47.540
3 misers is ok

01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:55.540
the United States of America

01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:57.540
as Eisenhower told you in the 1950s

01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:59.540
and warned you

01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:01.540
but a very interesting industrial policy

01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:05.540
you don't have a formal industrial policy

01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:07.540
you have something called the military industrial complex

01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:09.540
and the military industrial complex

01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:11.540
is essential for American capitalism

01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:13.540
in the way that the American capitalism

01:34:13.540 --> 01:34:15.540
has been created

01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:17.540
so

01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:19.540
the reason why

01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:21.540
Missouri

01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:23.540
and Massachusetts can be in the same union

01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:25.540
and you don't have the same problems that we have

01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:27.540
between Greece and Germany

01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:29.540
it's because you have

01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:31.540
what I call a surplus recycling mechanism

01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:33.540
you have food stamps

01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:35.540
you have social security

01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:37.540
and that means that money

01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:39.540
that is taxed in the surplus

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:41.540
states is transferred

01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:43.540
to the deficit states and that keeps

01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:45.540
a degree of balance

01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:47.540
but the most important part of your surplus

01:34:47.540 --> 01:34:49.540
recycling mechanism

01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:51.540
is in the military industrial complex

01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:53.540
so when Boeing gets a contract

01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:55.540
to build the new generation of fighter jets

01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:57.540
quadrillions

01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:01.540
the Pentagon says to them

01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:03.540
but you're going to have to build the engine

01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:05.540
in a new site in Missouri

01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:07.540
in the deficit places

01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:09.540
the spare parts of this and that

01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:11.540
over there and so on

01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:13.540
so

01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:15.540
to keep this going you need some wars

01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:19.540
I'm not proposing that this is how it should be

01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:21.540
I'm just describing it

01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:23.540
so in 1991

01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:25.540
the Pentagon

01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:27.540
and the Treasury Department

01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:29.540
had a major

01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:31.540
major headache

01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:33.540
the Cold War had finished

01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:35.540
so they could no longer pass through Congress

01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:37.540
on the basis of national security

01:35:37.540 --> 01:35:39.540
the bills that were necessary

01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:41.540
in order to keep replenishing

01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:43.540
the cruise and pressing missiles

01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:45.540
so they had to clear the stock

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:47.540
so you had the first war in Iraq

01:35:47.540 --> 01:35:49.540
and remember

01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:51.540
the war had finished

01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:53.540
they were going into the middle of the desert

01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:55.540
finding all the cruise and pressing missiles

01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:57.540
to get rid of them

01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:59.540
so that they could order new ones

01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:01.540
so capitalism is just

01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:03.540
a very rational system

01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:05.540
because

01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:07.540
it's a very simple reason why it's so irrational

01:36:07.540 --> 01:36:09.540
because it has a productive capacity

01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:11.540
a capacity to produce

01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:13.540
which far exceeds

01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:15.540
its capacity to consume

01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:17.540
so something has to make up this difference

01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:19.540
and war is a result

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:21.540
not just lack of democracy

01:36:21.540 --> 01:36:23.540
Hi, thank you for tonight

01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:25.540
question for you

01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:27.540
if we

01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:29.540
theoretically go back to 2015

01:36:29.540 --> 01:36:31.540
you're now in charge instead of

01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:33.540
Cyprus, in charge of Greece

01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:35.540
faced with harsh austerity versus Grexit

01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:37.540
what political path would you have chosen?

01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:39.540
You know the answer

01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:41.540
that's why I'm here, I'm not in the ministry

01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:45.540
why am I not in the ministry

01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:47.540
why did I resign

01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:49.540
we had an agreement

01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:51.540
we had a very simple agreement

01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:53.540
and this is the only reason why I accepted the finance ministry

01:36:53.540 --> 01:36:55.540
and to run in the election

01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:57.540
we had an agreement that there were three possible outcomes

01:36:57.540 --> 01:36:59.540
I'll put it succinctly

01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:01.540
three possible outcomes

01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:03.540
one was

01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:05.540
continuing debt bondage

01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:07.540
in the euro

01:37:07.540 --> 01:37:09.540
which is what has been happening since 2010

01:37:09.540 --> 01:37:11.540
for me that was the worst possible outcome

01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:13.540
another outcome was Grexit

01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:15.540
for Greece to be chucked out of the eurozone

01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:17.540
or to choose to get out

01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:19.540
this came

01:37:19.540 --> 01:37:21.540
with substantial costs

01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:23.540
and it was never my proposal

01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:25.540
but I always considered it to be better

01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:27.540
than perpetual debt bondage in the euro

01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:29.540
when people say but the euro is a strong currency

01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:31.540
I say if you're a pauper

01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:33.540
and you live under a bridge in New York

01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:35.540
you have one dollar in your pocket

01:37:35.540 --> 01:37:37.540
it doesn't mean you have a strong currency

01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:39.540
you have one bloody dollar in your pocket

01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:41.540
it doesn't help much

01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:43.540
and then

01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:45.540
the first best

01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:47.540
my

01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:49.540
ideal solution

01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:51.540
would be

01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:53.540
debt restructuring within the euro

01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:55.540
that would allow us to stay in the euro in a sustainable way

01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:57.540
and to end the great depression

01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:59.540
so the point I was making was

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:01.540
no bluffing

01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:03.540
we say to them we don't want to get out of the euro

01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:05.540
but we need a debt restructure

01:38:05.540 --> 01:38:07.540
and we need the end of austerity

01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:09.540
for Greece to remain

01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:11.540
sustainable within the euro

01:38:11.540 --> 01:38:13.540
and let's sit down and we'll compromise

01:38:13.540 --> 01:38:15.540
I did say to Obama

01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:17.540
when he said you have to compromise

01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:19.540
I compromised

01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:21.540
I dream of compromise

01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:23.540
but I'm never going to be

01:38:23.540 --> 01:38:25.540
compromised

01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:27.540
there is a fundamental difference between the two

01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:29.540
ok

01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:31.540
and we say to them

01:38:31.540 --> 01:38:33.540
we are not going to accept that

01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:35.540
we are not putting our signature on another loan agreement

01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:37.540
that extends and pretends

01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:39.540
our bankruptcy into the future

01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:41.540
shoot us, kill us, get us out of the euro

01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:43.540
we don't want to get out of the euro

01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:45.540
but we consider getting out of the euro to be

01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:47.540
a lesser evil

01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:49.540
than staying under the conditions of debt

01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:51.540
so Cyprus supposedly agreed with me

01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:53.540
and not only agreed with me but considered to be more

01:38:53.540 --> 01:38:55.540
right-wing than him

01:38:55.540 --> 01:38:57.540
and more ready to compromise

01:38:57.540 --> 01:38:59.540
and he had some reasons

01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:01.540
not that he was right

01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:03.540
but

01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:05.540
you'll be very

01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:07.540
interested to hear that

01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:09.540
but one of the people that worked with me

01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:11.540
during this period in creating

01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:13.540
the plan and the narrative against

01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:15.540
the Troika and the International Monetary Fund

01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:17.540
was somebody called Larry Summers

01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:19.540
who was actually very good

01:39:19.540 --> 01:39:21.540
because he understood that what was happening in Greece

01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:23.540
reflected

01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:25.540
very quickly and immediately in the European

01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:27.540
macroeconomic stance

01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:29.540
which was detrimental to the interests of the United States

01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:31.540
so we worked together

01:39:31.540 --> 01:39:33.540
with Larry Summers

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:35.540
and when we met I said

01:39:35.540 --> 01:39:37.540
I'm very glad you haven't read my last book

01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:39.540
and he said

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:41.540
why? I said because

01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:43.540
I referred to it to you

01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:45.540
on a number of occasions in the same book

01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:47.540
as the prince of darkness

01:39:47.540 --> 01:39:49.540
and he said

01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:51.540
well at least you called me prince

01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:53.540
I've been called worse

01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:55.540
so it's clear

01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:57.540
the two organizations

01:39:57.540 --> 01:39:59.540
I like to follow side by side

01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:01.540
the DM25 movement

01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:03.540
and six degrees of citizen space

01:40:03.540 --> 01:40:05.540
in Canada

01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:07.540
with John Rouse and Saul

01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:09.540
and I just really enjoyed John Rouse and Saul's book

01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:11.540
The Collapse of Globalism

01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:13.540
and he describes this idea

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:15.540
of a positive form of nationalism

01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:17.540
that we haven't explored

01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:19.540
we think of nationalism as negative

01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:21.540
and we often only see negative forms

01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:23.540
based on exclusion

01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:25.540
but our movements like

01:40:25.540 --> 01:40:27.540
DM25

01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:29.540
imagining

01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:31.540
and exploring possibly

01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:33.540
hijacking and displacing hate

01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:35.540
with positive forms of nationalism

01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:37.540
that are centered around

01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:39.540
inclusion

01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:41.540
and

01:40:41.540 --> 01:40:43.540
sort of collective missions

01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:45.540
like reducing inequality

01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:47.540
that can capture a lot of the people

01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:49.540
that are displaced in this country

01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:51.540
the Trump voters that might not be racist

01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:53.540
that just wanted a better deal

01:40:53.540 --> 01:40:55.540
and they really fall in with the flag

01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:57.540
when someone waves the flag

01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:59.540
they're easy to be manipulated

01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:01.540
but they just feel that they must go with it

01:41:01.540 --> 01:41:03.540
but now in this country

01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:05.540
when you see two American flags

01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:07.540
on the back of a pickup truck

01:41:07.540 --> 01:41:09.540
that's kind of a hate symbol

01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:11.540
the left progressive people

01:41:11.540 --> 01:41:13.540
that enjoy inclusion

01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:15.540
have maybe allowed

01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:17.540
the flag to get stolen from them

01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:19.540
but then at the same time

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:21.540
we need to integrate nationalism

01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:23.540
possibly a new form

01:41:23.540 --> 01:41:25.540
with ideas like a federation

01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:27.540
to gain more power

01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:29.540
back into

01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:31.540
the political sphere

01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:33.540
against the financial sphere

01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:35.540
Well, let me say that

01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:37.540
I get your drift

01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:41.540
I grew up in a culture

01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:43.540
where the left

01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:47.540
answered this question of yours

01:41:47.540 --> 01:41:49.540
a long time ago

01:41:49.540 --> 01:41:51.540
by making a distinction

01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:53.540
not between positive and negative

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:55.540
but between patriotism

01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:57.540
a line was always

01:41:57.540 --> 01:41:59.540
we're patriots

01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:01.540
and the difference between a patriot and a nationalist

01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:03.540
the patriot loves his country

01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:05.540
and the nationalist thinks that his country

01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:07.540
has the right to steamroll over every other country

01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:09.540
and I think that is a good way

01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:11.540
of resolving it

01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:13.540
and also by making this more

01:42:13.540 --> 01:42:15.540
contemporary

01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:17.540
I think we have to

01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:19.540
appropriate the

01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:21.540
slogan

01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:23.540
we should take this

01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:25.540
I want my city back

01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:27.540
I want my neighborhood back

01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:29.540
I want control over my city

01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:31.540
my municipality

01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:33.540
my state, my country

01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:35.540
but the only way to get my country back

01:42:35.540 --> 01:42:37.540
is if others get their country back

01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:39.540
as well

01:42:39.540 --> 01:42:41.540
and if we all work together

01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:43.540
and we understand that to get our country back

01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:45.540
we need to resolve problems such as

01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:47.540
low quality jobs

01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:49.540
low levels of investments

01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:51.540
in the green transition

01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:53.540
that the planet needs

01:42:53.540 --> 01:42:55.540
climate change and so on

01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:57.540
that we need to fight poverty

01:42:57.540 --> 01:42:59.540
and it is impossible to fight poverty in one country

01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:01.540
when it's rising in other countries

01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:03.540
if you think that you can do that

01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:05.540
you're deluding yourself

01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:07.540
so in effect

01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:09.540
to embed patriotism

01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:11.540
in a narrative which sees

01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:13.540
the major problems that society faces

01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:15.540
like poverty, low investment

01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:17.540
problems with the health service and so on

01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:19.540
as we see climate change

01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:23.540
what I mean by that

01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:25.540
is climate change requires local action

01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:27.540
that we do things here

01:43:27.540 --> 01:43:29.540
in Boston, that we do things in Massachusetts

01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:31.540
in the United States but we have to act globally

01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:33.540
as well

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:35.540
and we need to cooperate

01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:37.540
because resolving poverty as I said

01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:39.540
can only happen at

01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:41.540
the Bretton Woods system is a good example

01:43:41.540 --> 01:43:43.540
poverty fell everywhere

01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:45.540
throughout the global system

01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:47.540
inequality shrunk everywhere

01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:49.540
it couldn't rise in one place massively

01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:51.540
and fall in another

01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:53.540
so we have to combine

01:43:53.540 --> 01:43:55.540
level of country, of neighborhoods

01:43:55.540 --> 01:43:57.540
of community, patriotism

01:43:57.540 --> 01:43:59.540
with transnationalism and internationalism

01:43:59.540 --> 01:44:01.540
that allows us to claim

01:44:01.540 --> 01:44:03.540
our own countries back

01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:05.540
a funny multinational question

01:44:05.540 --> 01:44:07.540
that I would love to hear answered from you

01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:09.540
in the book

01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:11.540
John Rouse and Saul describes this concept

01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:13.540
where a lot of the trade

01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:15.540
we have is fictitious

01:44:15.540 --> 01:44:17.540
it is multinationals trading with themselves

01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:19.540
yeah of course

01:44:19.540 --> 01:44:21.540
and

01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:23.540
it's called limit pricing

01:44:23.540 --> 01:44:25.540
well now you know we were just

01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:27.540
creating these tariffs

01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:29.540
that might not really get to the root

01:44:29.540 --> 01:44:31.540
of the issue we were punishing multinationals

01:44:31.540 --> 01:44:33.540
we weren't punishing another nation

01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:35.540
we were punishing multinationals

01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:37.540
that straddle to nations

01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:39.540
and that not a lot of people in this country

01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:41.540
know how to think of these concepts

01:44:41.540 --> 01:44:43.540
well I have a better way

01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:45.540
of punishing the multinationals

01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:47.540
how about making the IRS do its job

01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:49.540
because if you

01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:51.540
go to

01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:53.540
Venezuela, or by the example

01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:55.540
if you go to Italy and make some money

01:44:55.540 --> 01:44:57.540
you get taxed here

01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:59.540
you are taxed by the IRS

01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:01.540
on your global income

01:45:01.540 --> 01:45:03.540
you cannot say

01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:05.540
I made $10,000 in

01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:07.540
Napoli and therefore

01:45:07.540 --> 01:45:09.540
none of your business

01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:11.540
you get taxed on your global income

01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:13.540
unless you are a corporation

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:15.540
and then you don't get taxed at all

01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:17.540
for the money you stash away

01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:19.540
all over the world

01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:21.540
how about having the IRS do its job

01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:23.540
instead of introducing

01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:25.540
tariffs that in the end

01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:27.540
have a detrimental effect on all of us

01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:29.540
but the IRS can't

01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:31.540
yes it can

01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:33.540
yes of course it can

01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:35.540
they need their marching orders

01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:37.540
from congress

01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:39.540
they need the politicians to say to them

01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:41.540
you are going to treat

01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:43.540
look, the supreme court

01:45:43.540 --> 01:45:45.540
in its infinite idiocy

01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:47.540
decided that corporations and human

01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:49.540
beings and individuals will be treated the same

01:45:49.540 --> 01:45:51.540
when it comes to super PACs and all that

01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:53.540
why not treat

01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:55.540
also decide that

01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:57.540
corporations and individuals will be treated the same

01:45:57.540 --> 01:45:59.540
tax wise

01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:01.540
I remember a beautiful

01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:03.540
poster I saw in Texas saying that

01:46:03.540 --> 01:46:05.540
I like it

01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:07.540
I believe that corporations

01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:09.540
have human rights

01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:11.540
when I see one of them being hanged

01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:15.540
that was Texas for you

01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:17.540
in the

01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:19.540
briefest and broadest of strokes

01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:21.540
in the post-capitalistic world

01:46:21.540 --> 01:46:23.540
that you envision

01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:25.540
what does the credit system look like

01:46:25.540 --> 01:46:27.540
and how does it achieve equilibrium

01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:29.540
with the sovereignty of states

01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:31.540
ok how long do we have

01:46:31.540 --> 01:46:33.540
no but

01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:35.540
let me put it simply

01:46:37.540 --> 01:46:39.540
if we have a system

01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:41.540
where private

01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:43.540
property

01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:45.540
is maintained over

01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:47.540
goods and services

01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:49.540
and things that give you happiness

01:46:49.540 --> 01:46:51.540
but not over

01:46:51.540 --> 01:46:53.540
productive processes

01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:55.540
and productive processes belong

01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:57.540
to those that work them

01:46:57.540 --> 01:46:59.540
that are part of it

01:46:59.540 --> 01:47:01.540
then you simply

01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:03.540
have a credit system

01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:05.540
you don't need one at all

01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:11.540
your justification for that is

01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:13.540
that credit is only necessary

01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:15.540
when you've got an asymmetrical distribution

01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:17.540
of property rights

01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:19.540
over means of production

01:47:19.540 --> 01:47:21.540
if you and I have a cooperative

01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:23.540
if we own a business together

01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:25.540
we have a partnership

01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:27.540
then I'm never going to be in your debt

01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:29.540
or you admire that

01:47:29.540 --> 01:47:31.540
we're producing together

01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:33.540
and we're going to be sharing the profits

01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:35.540
that we make

01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:37.540
what about investors

01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:39.540
well there would be no investors

01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:41.540
what about the other person

01:47:41.540 --> 01:47:43.540
because investors exist only because

01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:45.540
you have an asymmetrical distribution

01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:47.540
of wealth

01:47:47.540 --> 01:47:49.540
if you didn't have asymmetrical distribution

01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:51.540
but look this is going to be the topic of my next book

01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:53.540
I have not written it yet

01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:55.540
so I'll see you in 3 years

01:47:59.540 --> 01:48:01.540
ευχαριστώ
