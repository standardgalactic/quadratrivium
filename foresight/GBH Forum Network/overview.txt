1. **Patriotism and Global Cooperation**: The fight against poverty, low investment, and issues like climate change requires a balance between local action (patriotism) and global cooperation. The Bretton Woods system exemplifies this by showing that reducing poverty globally also reduces inequality worldwide, which cannot rise sharply in one place while falling in another.

2. **Multinational Trade Issues**: John Rowe and Saul describe the issue of multinationals trading with themselves, which can appear as fictitious trade on paper but is a real economic activity. Punishing these multinationals through tariffs might not address the root cause and could harm consumers.

3. **Taxing Global Income**: The IRS should enforce global taxation for individuals making money abroad, as they are currently exempted unless they are individuals, in which case they are taxed on their global income. Corporations, however, are not taxed at all on the money they stash worldwide.

4. **Post-Capitalistic Society**: In a post-capitalistic society, private property over goods and services is maintained, but productive processes are owned and managed by those who work them. This eliminates the need for credit systems as long as there is an equitable distribution of property rights.

5. **Credit Systems**: Credit systems are necessary only in societies with an asymmetrical distribution of property rights over means of production. In a more balanced society where people cooperatively own and manage businesses, credit would not be needed because profits and debts would be shared among the participants.

6. **Investors**: Investors exist due to the asymmetrical distribution of wealth. In a more equitable system, this role would likely diminish or disappear.

7. **Next Steps**: The discussion on how credit systems can achieve equilibrium with sovereign states in a post-capitalistic world will be explored further in the author's next book.
