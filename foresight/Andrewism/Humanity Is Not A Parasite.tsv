0	9000	Humanity is a plague. Humanity is a poison. Humanity is the real virus. Humanity is a parasite.
9000	15000	The human parasitism narrative has grown increasingly common in day-to-day discourse,
15000	18000	with folks casually confessing their simmering misanthropy.
18000	22000	You don't have to look very hard to figure out why their sentiment has gained popularity.
22000	26000	The impact of modern industrial human activity on the planet
26000	30000	is blatantly apparent and truly global in scope.
30000	37000	The disruptions to our flora, fauna, soil, water, atmosphere, and climate cannot be ignored.
37000	42000	Despite the empty promises of governments and greenwashing PR campaigns of corporations,
42000	48000	the reality of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the persistence of Saharan and Gobi desertification,
48000	55000	the unmitigated emission of toxicants into our atmosphere, the commonality of irreversible oil spills,
55000	59000	the acidification and neutrification of our rivers, lakes, and oceans,
59000	66000	the deforestation of our old growth forests, the loss of our top soils, evermore paper and plastics,
66000	70000	and the Holocene extinction cannot be ignored.
70000	77000	These are grave affronts to the environment that stay in the last 100 years of our millennia on this Earth.
77000	83000	Just as colonialism swept through continents, so too has environmental destruction,
83000	89000	as the violence inflicted upon both peoples and their lands cannot be unyoked.
89000	95000	Of course, prior to the era of European imperialism, human activity has damaged parts of the Earth,
95000	99000	but this activity has typically been local in scope.
99000	104000	Human activities have also helped cultivate many of the so-called natural environments we seek out today,
104000	106000	like the Amazon rainforest.
106000	110000	Human parasitism is not a natural outcome of humanity.
110000	114000	Otherwise, we would have doomed ourselves a long, long ago.
114000	118000	No, this mass destruction is recent.
118000	125000	Not embedded in human nature, but distinctly political, economic, and social.
125000	130000	Sir David Attenborough and others go around stoking fares of overpopulation,
130000	133000	despite the already declining global population growth rate,
133000	138000	provoking existing eco-fascist and racist narratives about the impoverished peoples of the world,
138000	143000	while brushing past the unequal distribution of resources and overconsumption
143000	149000	under the socio-economic system of racial, industrial capitalism that truly fuels this crisis.
149000	155000	The affluence enjoyed by some is the waste that we all suffer the consequences of.
155000	161000	The colossal burden of consumerist society, ever heightened by a mass media obsessed with conspicuous consumption,
161000	163000	can no longer be ignored.
163000	167000	Earth is not some lump of resources to be extracted and polluted.
167000	173000	It sustains a complex web of life, one that this system is very clearly set out to destroy.
173000	177000	Whenever I hear people lament the parasitism of humanity,
177000	181000	I think back to a quote by the communalist, Murray Buckchin.
181000	186000	Obviously, man can be described as a highly destructive parasite,
186000	192000	who threatens to destroy his host, the natural world, and eventually himself.
192000	197000	In ecology, however, the word parasite, using this over-simplified sense,
197000	202000	is not an answer to a question, but raises a question itself.
202000	209000	Ecologists know that a destructive parasitism of this kind usually reflects the disruption of an ecological situation.
209000	217000	Indeed, many species that seem highly destructive under one set of conditions are eminently useful under another set of conditions.
217000	223000	What imparts a profoundly critical function to ecology is the question raised by man's destructive activities.
223000	228000	What is the disruption that has turned man into a destructive parasite?
228000	234000	What produces a form of human parasitism that results not only in vast natural imbalances,
234000	238000	but also threatens the existence of humanity itself?
238000	243000	This disruption is not only felt in the environment, but also in our relations with each other.
243000	252000	Hierarchical social relationships beget a form of human domination that imbalances both our natural and our social worlds.
252000	256000	The patriarchal family is basically the blueprint that planted this seed.
256000	263000	Now the capitalist and politicians that dominate us exploit us and deprive us in their self-seeking pursuit of power and profit,
263000	269000	will go on extracting, consuming, expelling, and expanding at enormous proportions until the very end.
269000	275000	This very centralized, very urbanized setup is highly burdensome upon our ecosystems,
275000	284000	and the dissolution of community and local economy, caused in part by capitalism's competitive and divisive nature, has enabled this capitalist exploitation.
284000	294000	Under the euphemisms of growth and progress, we and every aspect of nature become simplified and commodified.
294000	304000	In Seeing Like a State, anthropologist James C. Scott describes how states reduce the complex, messy eligibility of human life
304000	309000	into simplified, legible formations, ripe for control.
309000	318000	For example, the transformation of open commons into private property, the centralization of water, transportation and energy systems,
318000	326000	and the shift from diverse and fluid local naming customs to permanent, state-recorded and tracked identification systems.
326000	331000	I see this simplification in the treatment of our environment too.
331000	337000	For example, the standard of monocultures that both feed us and eventually poison us.
337000	347000	The immense chemical requirements of industrial agriculture to manage the soil and the so-called pests that arise to regulate its violation are environmentally devastating.
347000	360000	Cities are frighteningly standardized across ecosystems, transforming vast swathes of natural diversity into smoggy, noisy edifices of concrete, glass and metal.
360000	369000	Some cities, regions, or even entire countries are simplified further by their dedication to particular industrial requirements.
369000	377000	Some places exist as mere resource depots while others house the people that manage the trade of those resources.
377000	383000	These cities are quite bureaucratic in their approach to their immense urban populations.
383000	398000	The logistic challenges of transportation, housing, feeding, educating, employing and entertaining such dense populations tends toward the submission of the individual to the massified, the creative to the standardized.
398000	402000	The systems that run our lives are faceless and impersonal.
402000	406000	We have little influence on the everyday political machinations of our societies.
406000	418000	We watch as nature is debased. We watch as complex ecosystems forged over millions of years absolutely necessary for the support of our own species are undermined and undone.
418000	427000	The systems of human domination, patriarchy, capitalism, the state and its many institutions have done well to disrupt our connection with the land
427000	430000	and make us complacent.
430000	434000	This is what makes social ecology so critical.
434000	449000	In its very essence, social ecology is about the relationship between ecological and social issues, understanding that ecological problems arise from social problems which are caused by social institutions rooted in hierarchy and domination.
449000	455000	Ecology deals with the balance of nature, which includes humanity.
455000	465000	Despite the arrogance of some folks, nature viewed in the totality of its aspects, cycles and interrelationships exists beyond our claims to its mastery.
465000	474000	The issues ecology deals with are inherently political, so by necessity, ecology must be both critical and constructive.
474000	486000	To achieve the necessary harmonization of man and nature, we must create a decentralized and distributed, liberated human community that lives in a lasting balance with its people and its natural environment.
486000	491000	The anarchic implications are clear.
491000	495000	Some may protest that such a society is unrealistic.
495000	500000	Why think of what could be when it's so much easier to limit ourselves to what we are?
500000	512000	Surely we should continue along the so-called practical, rational, capitalist and status notions of the world, and yet we have reached its breaking point, and things continue to break down.
512000	518000	These oppressive structures are eroding our humanity, our communities and our ecologies.
518000	524000	In fact, their domination threatens the viability of life itself.
524000	534000	For us to thrive and survive, we need to embrace more anarchic conceptions of society, and especially one of its most essential principles, diversity.
534000	548000	Our environments should be varied, complex and dynamic, as balance, harmony and evolution in nature and society could only be achieved through organic differentiation, not sterile standardization.
548000	560000	The communities I'm envisioning are decentralized but socially and economically interconnected, confederating while maintaining the principles of free association for both communities and individuals.
560000	567000	For people to be invested in their society and their environment, we must relearn the practice of participation in communal processes.
567000	575000	Horizontal decision-making power, responsibility and the consequences of such must be equally distributed.
575000	583000	Our role in the ecological community must be significantly transformed, most pressingly in the realm of agriculture.
583000	591000	Fast factory farms and unsustainable industrial monocultures must be phased out for decentralized polycultures.
591000	605000	We must familiarize ourselves with the sensitive subtleties of the land, maintain the health of the soil, increase the sustenance of the watershed and cultivate diversity of the flora and fauna specific to the regions we inhabit.
605000	608000	This can only occur on the human scale.
609000	623000	When it comes to technology, it is absolutely vital that we shift away from the violent mining practices occurring around the globe, scale down the wasteful mass production of many technologies, abolish the practice of planned obsolescence,
623000	640000	produce and distribute necessities like pharmaceuticals, safety effectively, explore the possibilities of low-tech, distribute the infrastructure necessary for production and transportation, and develop the machines and tools we do use for durability and multifunction.
640000	653000	I don't believe every technology can or should be developed exclusively on the local scale because I don't think every community can or even should be entirely 100% self-sufficient, but it's something I believe we'll be able to figure out better in practice.
653000	662000	Also, renewable energy technologies have some issues attached to them, particularly related to the sourcing of their materials and their production capacity.
662000	675000	So while we may utilize the power of the sun, wind and water, suited to our regional energy patterns, we also need to reduce our energy consumption to accommodate the inevitable material limitations.
675000	686000	We seriously need to undertake the task of creating a new way of life based on a more playful form of labour instead of the ecologically and physically exhausting form of work that currently exists.
686000	708000	It will require significant effort to make that quantitative and qualitative shift to both cut down on the amount of BS work being done by a significant margin and transform necessary and useful activities from 9-5 slogs to pastimes we can have a say in, take a rest from when needed and actually enjoy.
708000	718000	Human parasitism, the force that destabilizes, regresses and debases the natural world, is not some inevitability of our existence.
718000	732000	To believe as much as to leave room for the corrosive and violent potentials of eco-fascism, it is the consequence of a disruption found in patriarchy, capitalism, white supremacy and the state.
732000	748000	Our survival is dependent on shifting toward the practice of anarchic ecological principles that seek to respect, conserve and preserve freedom and variety between humans, between humanity and nature, and within nature itself.
748000	762000	We need to create real communities capable of bringing out the full potential of each individual and ecosystem and freeing them of the oppressive burdens of authority so that we can truly humanize humanity.
762000	766000	All power to all the people. Peace.
