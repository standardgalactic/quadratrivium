00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Humanity is a plague. Humanity is a poison. Humanity is the real virus. Humanity is a parasite.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
The human parasitism narrative has grown increasingly common in day-to-day discourse,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
with folks casually confessing their simmering misanthropy.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
You don't have to look very hard to figure out why their sentiment has gained popularity.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
The impact of modern industrial human activity on the planet

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
is blatantly apparent and truly global in scope.

00:30.000 --> 00:37.000
The disruptions to our flora, fauna, soil, water, atmosphere, and climate cannot be ignored.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
Despite the empty promises of governments and greenwashing PR campaigns of corporations,

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
the reality of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, the persistence of Saharan and Gobi desertification,

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
the unmitigated emission of toxicants into our atmosphere, the commonality of irreversible oil spills,

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
the acidification and neutrification of our rivers, lakes, and oceans,

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
the deforestation of our old growth forests, the loss of our top soils, evermore paper and plastics,

01:06.000 --> 01:10.000
and the Holocene extinction cannot be ignored.

01:10.000 --> 01:17.000
These are grave affronts to the environment that stay in the last 100 years of our millennia on this Earth.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
Just as colonialism swept through continents, so too has environmental destruction,

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
as the violence inflicted upon both peoples and their lands cannot be unyoked.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
Of course, prior to the era of European imperialism, human activity has damaged parts of the Earth,

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
but this activity has typically been local in scope.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Human activities have also helped cultivate many of the so-called natural environments we seek out today,

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
like the Amazon rainforest.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Human parasitism is not a natural outcome of humanity.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
Otherwise, we would have doomed ourselves a long, long ago.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
No, this mass destruction is recent.

01:58.000 --> 02:05.000
Not embedded in human nature, but distinctly political, economic, and social.

02:05.000 --> 02:10.000
Sir David Attenborough and others go around stoking fares of overpopulation,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
despite the already declining global population growth rate,

02:13.000 --> 02:18.000
provoking existing eco-fascist and racist narratives about the impoverished peoples of the world,

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
while brushing past the unequal distribution of resources and overconsumption

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
under the socio-economic system of racial, industrial capitalism that truly fuels this crisis.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
The affluence enjoyed by some is the waste that we all suffer the consequences of.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
The colossal burden of consumerist society, ever heightened by a mass media obsessed with conspicuous consumption,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
can no longer be ignored.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
Earth is not some lump of resources to be extracted and polluted.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
It sustains a complex web of life, one that this system is very clearly set out to destroy.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Whenever I hear people lament the parasitism of humanity,

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
I think back to a quote by the communalist, Murray Buckchin.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
Obviously, man can be described as a highly destructive parasite,

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
who threatens to destroy his host, the natural world, and eventually himself.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
In ecology, however, the word parasite, using this over-simplified sense,

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
is not an answer to a question, but raises a question itself.

03:22.000 --> 03:29.000
Ecologists know that a destructive parasitism of this kind usually reflects the disruption of an ecological situation.

03:29.000 --> 03:37.000
Indeed, many species that seem highly destructive under one set of conditions are eminently useful under another set of conditions.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
What imparts a profoundly critical function to ecology is the question raised by man's destructive activities.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
What is the disruption that has turned man into a destructive parasite?

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
What produces a form of human parasitism that results not only in vast natural imbalances,

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
but also threatens the existence of humanity itself?

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
This disruption is not only felt in the environment, but also in our relations with each other.

04:03.000 --> 04:12.000
Hierarchical social relationships beget a form of human domination that imbalances both our natural and our social worlds.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
The patriarchal family is basically the blueprint that planted this seed.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.000
Now the capitalist and politicians that dominate us exploit us and deprive us in their self-seeking pursuit of power and profit,

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
will go on extracting, consuming, expelling, and expanding at enormous proportions until the very end.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
This very centralized, very urbanized setup is highly burdensome upon our ecosystems,

04:35.000 --> 04:44.000
and the dissolution of community and local economy, caused in part by capitalism's competitive and divisive nature, has enabled this capitalist exploitation.

04:44.000 --> 04:54.000
Under the euphemisms of growth and progress, we and every aspect of nature become simplified and commodified.

04:54.000 --> 05:04.000
In Seeing Like a State, anthropologist James C. Scott describes how states reduce the complex, messy eligibility of human life

05:04.000 --> 05:09.000
into simplified, legible formations, ripe for control.

05:09.000 --> 05:18.000
For example, the transformation of open commons into private property, the centralization of water, transportation and energy systems,

05:18.000 --> 05:26.000
and the shift from diverse and fluid local naming customs to permanent, state-recorded and tracked identification systems.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
I see this simplification in the treatment of our environment too.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
For example, the standard of monocultures that both feed us and eventually poison us.

05:37.000 --> 05:47.000
The immense chemical requirements of industrial agriculture to manage the soil and the so-called pests that arise to regulate its violation are environmentally devastating.

05:47.000 --> 06:00.000
Cities are frighteningly standardized across ecosystems, transforming vast swathes of natural diversity into smoggy, noisy edifices of concrete, glass and metal.

06:00.000 --> 06:09.000
Some cities, regions, or even entire countries are simplified further by their dedication to particular industrial requirements.

06:09.000 --> 06:17.000
Some places exist as mere resource depots while others house the people that manage the trade of those resources.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
These cities are quite bureaucratic in their approach to their immense urban populations.

06:23.000 --> 06:38.000
The logistic challenges of transportation, housing, feeding, educating, employing and entertaining such dense populations tends toward the submission of the individual to the massified, the creative to the standardized.

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
The systems that run our lives are faceless and impersonal.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
We have little influence on the everyday political machinations of our societies.

06:46.000 --> 06:58.000
We watch as nature is debased. We watch as complex ecosystems forged over millions of years absolutely necessary for the support of our own species are undermined and undone.

06:58.000 --> 07:07.000
The systems of human domination, patriarchy, capitalism, the state and its many institutions have done well to disrupt our connection with the land

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
and make us complacent.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
This is what makes social ecology so critical.

07:14.000 --> 07:29.000
In its very essence, social ecology is about the relationship between ecological and social issues, understanding that ecological problems arise from social problems which are caused by social institutions rooted in hierarchy and domination.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
Ecology deals with the balance of nature, which includes humanity.

07:35.000 --> 07:45.000
Despite the arrogance of some folks, nature viewed in the totality of its aspects, cycles and interrelationships exists beyond our claims to its mastery.

07:45.000 --> 07:54.000
The issues ecology deals with are inherently political, so by necessity, ecology must be both critical and constructive.

07:54.000 --> 08:06.000
To achieve the necessary harmonization of man and nature, we must create a decentralized and distributed, liberated human community that lives in a lasting balance with its people and its natural environment.

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
The anarchic implications are clear.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
Some may protest that such a society is unrealistic.

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
Why think of what could be when it's so much easier to limit ourselves to what we are?

08:20.000 --> 08:32.000
Surely we should continue along the so-called practical, rational, capitalist and status notions of the world, and yet we have reached its breaking point, and things continue to break down.

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
These oppressive structures are eroding our humanity, our communities and our ecologies.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
In fact, their domination threatens the viability of life itself.

08:44.000 --> 08:54.000
For us to thrive and survive, we need to embrace more anarchic conceptions of society, and especially one of its most essential principles, diversity.

08:54.000 --> 09:08.000
Our environments should be varied, complex and dynamic, as balance, harmony and evolution in nature and society could only be achieved through organic differentiation, not sterile standardization.

09:08.000 --> 09:20.000
The communities I'm envisioning are decentralized but socially and economically interconnected, confederating while maintaining the principles of free association for both communities and individuals.

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
For people to be invested in their society and their environment, we must relearn the practice of participation in communal processes.

09:27.000 --> 09:35.000
Horizontal decision-making power, responsibility and the consequences of such must be equally distributed.

09:35.000 --> 09:43.000
Our role in the ecological community must be significantly transformed, most pressingly in the realm of agriculture.

09:43.000 --> 09:51.000
Fast factory farms and unsustainable industrial monocultures must be phased out for decentralized polycultures.

09:51.000 --> 10:05.000
We must familiarize ourselves with the sensitive subtleties of the land, maintain the health of the soil, increase the sustenance of the watershed and cultivate diversity of the flora and fauna specific to the regions we inhabit.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
This can only occur on the human scale.

10:09.000 --> 10:23.000
When it comes to technology, it is absolutely vital that we shift away from the violent mining practices occurring around the globe, scale down the wasteful mass production of many technologies, abolish the practice of planned obsolescence,

10:23.000 --> 10:40.000
produce and distribute necessities like pharmaceuticals, safety effectively, explore the possibilities of low-tech, distribute the infrastructure necessary for production and transportation, and develop the machines and tools we do use for durability and multifunction.

10:40.000 --> 10:53.000
I don't believe every technology can or should be developed exclusively on the local scale because I don't think every community can or even should be entirely 100% self-sufficient, but it's something I believe we'll be able to figure out better in practice.

10:53.000 --> 11:02.000
Also, renewable energy technologies have some issues attached to them, particularly related to the sourcing of their materials and their production capacity.

11:02.000 --> 11:15.000
So while we may utilize the power of the sun, wind and water, suited to our regional energy patterns, we also need to reduce our energy consumption to accommodate the inevitable material limitations.

11:15.000 --> 11:26.000
We seriously need to undertake the task of creating a new way of life based on a more playful form of labour instead of the ecologically and physically exhausting form of work that currently exists.

11:26.000 --> 11:48.000
It will require significant effort to make that quantitative and qualitative shift to both cut down on the amount of BS work being done by a significant margin and transform necessary and useful activities from 9-5 slogs to pastimes we can have a say in, take a rest from when needed and actually enjoy.

11:48.000 --> 11:58.000
Human parasitism, the force that destabilizes, regresses and debases the natural world, is not some inevitability of our existence.

11:58.000 --> 12:12.000
To believe as much as to leave room for the corrosive and violent potentials of eco-fascism, it is the consequence of a disruption found in patriarchy, capitalism, white supremacy and the state.

12:12.000 --> 12:28.000
Our survival is dependent on shifting toward the practice of anarchic ecological principles that seek to respect, conserve and preserve freedom and variety between humans, between humanity and nature, and within nature itself.

12:28.000 --> 12:42.000
We need to create real communities capable of bringing out the full potential of each individual and ecosystem and freeing them of the oppressive burdens of authority so that we can truly humanize humanity.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
All power to all the people. Peace.
