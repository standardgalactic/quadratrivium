Checking Mercedarian Friars USA/The Lord's Prayer in the Timucuan Native American Language.txt
 The Lord's Prayer, also known as the Our Father, is a central Christian prayer that Jesus taught to his disciples. It exists in many different translations and adaptations across various languages, including those spoken by Native American tribes. Since there are numerous indigenous languages with diverse dialects, not all have a direct translation of the Lord's Prayer. However, efforts have been made to translate this prayer into several Native American languages through missionary work and language preservation initiatives.

For example, among the Navajo (Din√©), the Lord's Prayer is available in their language. The Lakota language also has a version of the Lord's Prayer, as do many other Native American languages. These translations are often a result of collaborative efforts between missionaries and linguists who work to preserve the indigenous languages and make important texts like the Lord's Prayer accessible to Native communities.

To learn the Lord's Prayer in a specific Native American language, you would typically look for resources provided by that tribe or community, or consult with someone who speaks that language fluently. It's also worth noting that these translations are often not as readily available online as they might be in printed materials produced by religious organizations or language preservation groups.
