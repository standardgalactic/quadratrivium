0	17980	No philosopher has influenced my thinking more than Ren√© Girard.
17980	24080	He showed me how I was caught up in meaningless status competitions, and how much I was driven
24080	27440	by desires that weren't even my own.
27440	29600	And I wasn't the only one.
29600	36880	Too many of my peers were miserable pursuing things not because they actually wanted them,
36880	40400	but because society told them to.
40400	47240	And sometimes, I look back and wonder how I ever functioned without Girard's ideas.
47240	54080	I see how swept up I was in vain pursuits, pointless social games, and status signaling,
54080	56680	which Girard exposed and rescued me from.
57120	64080	And if there were ever a set of ideas that radically changed my life, these would be it.
64080	70760	The journey of acquiring these ideas, however, was a long and painful struggle.
70760	77160	Girard's writing is hard to understand, his theories seem antiquated and abstract, and
77160	83200	his books jump from idea to idea without an apparent structure.
83200	86640	This is why the series exists.
86640	91240	Over the next seven lectures, we're going to cover the entirety of Girard's system
91240	97160	in a structured and understandable way, while exploring the relevance of his ideas for the
97160	100200	contemporary world.
100200	105440	My name is David Perrell, and I'm going to be moderating these lectures, which are
105440	111480	made possible by the generous grant of Tyler Cowan's Emergent Ventures Program.
111480	115120	As your host, I'll be listening and learning here with you.
115120	118760	And with that, I'd like to introduce our lecturer, Jonathan B.
118760	123680	Jonathan, I know you're busy.
123680	124680	Thanks for taking the time.
124680	125680	Thanks for having me.
125680	129080	If you're going to do all the hard work of setting up and I can just ramble on philosophy,
129080	130760	you can have me any time of the week.
130760	132560	Well, I'm glad you could be here.
132560	138160	And before you introduce us to Girard, I'd like to introduce you to our audience.
138160	139760	And I want to start with how we met.
139760	144920	I was hosting a philosophy discussion group in New York City.
144920	148480	And at the time, we were reading Augustine's City of God.
148480	151680	And I remember you being on the other side of the room, and you start sharing.
151680	155040	And I was so impressed with the rigor and the intensity of your discussion.
155040	156960	I was like, who is this guy?
156960	158360	And so we became fast friends.
158360	162120	I audited your philosophy class at Columbia.
162120	165680	Now we both live in Austin, Texas, where we must have dinner together two, three nights
165680	167360	a week.
167360	171120	And in that time, I've been very impressed.
171120	176600	And what stands out the most is just the discipline and the thoughtfulness that you bring to philosophy.
176600	181520	And what I would like to do now is talk a little bit about how you got here today.
181520	186920	So you were born in China, where you were raised between Beijing and later moved to
186920	192240	Vancouver, and you spent most of your formative years training in Olympiad math.
192240	196920	At 15, you won a Canadian gold medal in the Pascal mathematics competition.
196920	201080	At 17, you were an invitee to the Canadian mathematical Olympiad.
201080	205800	At 18, you were awarded a full ride scholarship at Columbia, where you studied computer science
205800	211480	as one of the top 20 Eggleston scholars in a class of over 2,000 people.
211480	214040	At 20, you finished your computer science degree.
214040	216640	And that's when you were introduced to Gerard.
216640	221440	And because of Gerard, you pursued a second degree in philosophy, where you focused on
221440	225200	continental social philosophy and Buddhist theory.
225200	229680	At 22, immediately after graduation, you started building a fintech startup with Joe
229680	232840	Lonsdale, which you've been working on for the past year.
232840	234480	Now, did I get that right?
234480	237200	Yeah, I think factually that is correct.
237200	240920	Although I don't know about the exact ages, I'm a bit worried that you've hyped me up
240920	242520	a bit too much.
242520	246360	Perhaps not unlike our equity markets, you've set me up so high that there's only one direction
246360	248360	that I can go from here and that's down.
248360	252480	Although in terms of the question of whether you miss anything, I think you did miss quite
252480	256400	a few important things to no fault of your own because no one gives introductions this
256400	259400	way that are relevant to my engagement with Gerard.
259400	263640	And those are all the personal failures and the suffering that I've had along the way
263640	265040	that really led me to Gerard.
265040	270720	I suspect this is probably a much broader point that when you give an introduction to a Gerardian
270720	276280	that you should highlight perhaps their failures just as much if not more than their successes
276280	280400	because it's often their failures that really drive them to Gerard.
280400	286960	I don't think Gerardian insights are rewarded, shall we say, in the victory of a triumph,
286960	291080	but you have to go out there and scavenge them from your fields of defeat.
291080	297000	And so it wasn't out of a mindset of achievement or even a leisurely strolling into Gerard
297000	303680	out of theoretical curiosity that I was acquainted with him, but I crawled to him out of a desperate
303680	307000	existential necessity.
307000	310280	So then how did you find your way to Gerard?
310280	315160	Yeah, well, like I mentioned, it's mostly personal suffering and strife, but maybe to
315160	321120	be a bit more specific, like many other teenagers, certainly ambitious teenagers, I was struggling
321120	327800	quite a bit in my first years at Columbia, not academically, not professionally, not socially,
327800	331600	but in a deep personal existential sense.
331600	336960	As a freshman at an elite college, I, if you'll excuse a funny metaphor, think you
337120	342400	kind of end up in a zoo with 2,000 other hyper conscious, status-oriented,
342400	344480	procedure-seeking teenagers.
344480	349720	And the one word that I think which captures the existential problem of such a community
349720	352520	well is hollowness.
352520	356920	And now this wasn't true for everyone, but most of us weren't really doing things, I
356920	363240	think, for their own sake, but out of what Gerard would call mimesis or natural capacity
363240	365560	and tendency to imitate others.
365560	371080	I mean, think about it like this, 2,000 of, allegedly, some of America's smartest and
371080	378320	most independent kids all end up after college wanting to go into four fields, finance, tech,
378320	380160	law, and then medicine.
380160	384720	And during college, we were supporting political causes we didn't care about to fly the right
384720	385720	colors.
385720	389520	We hung out with the right people, we wanted to see and dating the right person, and we
389520	394040	worked our asses off hustling for prestigious internships that a lot of us actually secretly
394040	395680	loathed.
395680	403320	And I think what made this all so much more perverse was that we had to lie to ourselves
403320	409280	to sustain these pursuits, that if we just squinted hard enough and intoxicated ourselves
409280	415720	in the equally drunken rhetoric of our peers, that we could fool ourselves into thinking
415720	420240	that this path of prestige is the right one for us to really be on.
421240	425800	And what was so existentially depressing, if you will, about such a life was not the
425800	427040	presence of wrong.
427040	432760	You know, we weren't being tortured, we weren't starving, but it's the absence of right.
432760	438240	That even the victories felt so hollow and meaningless, like getting a prestigious internship.
438240	443360	That was a one day or three day buzz that went away as fast as it came.
443360	448480	And I think these victories were so meaningless because they weren't out of our own genuine
448520	452560	desires, but a product of mimesis, what we felt like we had to do out of some kind of
452560	454800	social pressure.
454800	460320	And what was the wake up call for me was in my sophomore year, seeing where this path
460320	462160	of mimesis was leading me down towards.
462160	466320	I was talking with Dalt, some of them in alumni living and working in Manhattan, and these
466320	467920	were the guys who had made it, right?
467920	472640	They had the right postal code, they had the right job, they had a hot partner, but they
472640	477960	were fundamentally plagued with the same type of existential problems.
477960	482480	They were making money they didn't need to buy shit that they didn't want, to impress
482480	485880	people they didn't particularly like.
485880	492320	And in them, I saw the same despair and hollowness, but in some sense, just even worse because
492320	494840	it's developed a bit further out.
494840	500680	And how can you not be hollow when you're living life in such a way where you're motivated
500680	507280	not by a core, strong, impetus of genuine desire, but this external shell of social
507280	508280	expectation?
508280	510720	Yeah, I see this all over the place.
510720	515080	I see the influence of a medic theory in so many aspects of society.
515080	519560	You see it with people take out a loan to buy some fancy car and they don't have the
519560	521320	money to do it.
521320	526520	You see it in the way that management consultants, you'll be talking to them and they'll talk
526520	530960	about the director level title at the company as if that's the salvation that's going to
530960	532760	make them happy forever.
532760	533840	They get it now.
533840	538800	They're no happier once they get that, but the worst kind of mimetic competition that
538800	542720	I saw was in high school.
542720	548920	And there was this weird thing where the parents would be really competitive and conniving
548920	553400	over where their children would go to schools like a status competition among them.
553400	559080	And they wanted their kids to go to Ivy's, these prestigious schools and the trophy at
559080	566000	the end was those bumper stickers on the back of the Mercedes with the university logo.
566000	572680	And I saw how through mimesis that people had lost their own way and they weren't even
572680	576760	aware of the nature of their own desire.
576760	581600	And I think it's this lack of awareness that if you don't have a proper understanding of
581600	587680	these forces makes it so easily for us, especially in today's modern society, to get caught up
587680	588960	in these forces.
588960	593920	And I think throughout college, I started getting a more and more intimate awareness
593920	598840	of the logic behind all of these phenomena that you experienced, not because I was above
598840	599840	the fold.
599840	605680	If anything, I was so aware of it because I was the most guilty, I was the most mimetic
605680	606680	of them all.
606680	612080	And what was so frightening to me was the realization as a sophomore that I could live
612080	616280	my entire life like this, fundamentally not for myself.
616280	619040	I knew I had to change before it was too late.
619040	622400	And I knew that there was a point where it was going to be too late, where the ship was
622400	626880	going to get too much speed, where if you'll human another metaphor, the daggers too deep
626880	628960	in the old king's heart.
628960	634760	Fortunately, in the pits of mind despair, I was introduced to the work of Ren√© Girard.
634760	636640	And so Girard saved me.
636640	641800	And I really do mean that in a very literal sense of the term, in the same way that Virgil
641800	650280	saved Dante by exposing to him the manifestations and the mechanisms behind human evil, as well
650280	654680	as guiding his purging of more milder forms of perversion.
654680	660240	Now, Girard saved me by presenting to me a theory of human nature that explained the
660240	665120	true origin of desire and its terrifying consequences, if not directed properly.
665120	671760	He gave me a more accurate map with which I myself could slowly unravel and untangle
671760	674200	myself from the memetic web.
674200	678560	And with this lecture series, my hope is to be able to gift this map to you and our listeners
678560	679560	as well.
679560	685520	So Jonathan, I got to ask you, is the power of Girard's ideas that they're going to stop
685520	687680	making us be memetic?
687680	694720	Or do you still feel like you're still as prone to chasing prestige and envy as before?
695120	696120	Yeah, you're definitely right.
696120	697120	It's definitely the latter.
697120	703520	Girard's ideas do not work on us by magically making us stop being memetic and social creatures.
703520	708120	In the same environment, I would say I'm just as susceptible to memetic forces as I was
708120	709120	before.
709120	712720	But his theory does have practical personal benefits.
712720	714960	Let me explain with an analogy.
714960	718840	I think there was a military theorist by the name of John Boyd.
718840	723000	And he said something, I'm going to have to paraphrase here, I don't know the exact quote,
723000	729920	like superior fighter pilots use their superior judgment to make sure they get into situations
729920	733080	where they never have to use their superior skill.
733080	739360	And the idea under that line is that what's perhaps more important than the ability to
739360	745200	deal with that situation is the foresight and judgment to fundamentally not get into
745200	746200	those situations.
746200	749520	And I think the same is true for what Girard has done for me.
749520	756080	When I am, say, already deeply envious or deeply prideful, the battle is already lost.
756080	760720	There's nothing that understanding Girard and memetic theory rationally can do for me.
760720	767240	The medic theory, however, gives me a framework to avoid situations which inspire debilitating
767240	771520	envy, which ignites sort of unproductive pride.
771520	775000	It tells us what type of person to avoid and who to have close.
775000	780320	It teaches us how to construct a social environment that is relatively sober and how to identify
780320	783440	ones that are prone to memetic contagion.
783440	789120	Memetic theory does not give us the power to resist damaging instances of memesis in
789120	794600	the moment, but it does give us the foresight to avoid them altogether.
794600	800280	So do you think Girard is worthy of engagement because of how therapeutic he is, how he can
800280	802200	rescue us from suffering?
802560	807880	Yeah, I would say the answer is probably yes and no, but perhaps let me answer that with
807880	809320	an anecdote.
809320	814920	One of Girard's collaborators was asked that similar question that why he was a Girardian.
814920	818560	And he answered, because it's cheaper than psychoanalysis.
818560	823720	Now this is supposed to be humorous, and the literal and perhaps uninteresting interpretation
823720	828720	is that you don't have to pay anyone to study Girard's ideas, but it can still have a therapeutic
828720	830920	effect of solving your problems.
830920	836000	But there's a much more interesting reading, I think, that cheaper here means economic,
836000	840560	being able to explain a much more phenomenon with much less assumptions and not just personal
840560	843760	therapeutic phenomena, but social historical as well.
843760	848360	Take the example of Freud and psychoanalysis, if you're familiar with that.
848360	852400	He had this idea of the Oedipus complex, right, where the son is rivaled with the father
852400	854400	and he the son desires the mother.
854400	859800	That's a very heavy, heavy assumption that we all have this inbuilt desire to have sex
859800	860800	with mom.
860800	863880	And it can only explain one set of phenomena.
863880	870040	Girard's memetic theory takes the same example, but sees humans as naturally imitative and
870040	874520	desire as contagious between people, including between father and son.
874520	879600	And as a result, the medical theory can explain not only the Oedipus complex, but a much broader
879600	885160	set of psychological, social, historical phenomenon where people desire similar things and then
885160	886160	enter into rivalry.
886400	893800	Hence, memetic theory is cheaper than psychoanalysis, doing much more with much less.
893800	899640	So I think Girard, to answer your question directly now, is probably only so therapeutic
899640	903400	because he hits on fundamental truths of the human condition.
903400	908240	Truths which are overlooked, or perhaps even more provocatively, systematically hidden
908240	909960	by modernity.
909960	915360	And these truths help us not only understanding ourselves, but understanding the world and
915360	917720	even the trajectory of history.
917720	923160	I think Girard's ideas help us navigate the world and help us see opportunity where others
923160	928680	may see barren land and see danger where most people have already let their guard down.
928680	932040	Let me give you a direct example here that I prepared for later on, but I think it's
932040	934880	a very fitting example here.
934880	940040	And it'll go to show the unique predictive power of Girard's theory in the social world,
940040	945480	beyond just personal therapy, because I don't want us to trivialize memetic theory.
945480	947960	The example I'm going to give is quite timely.
947960	953880	It has to do with the relationship between China-America, the Sino-American relationship.
953880	961600	Against the crowd, Girard in 2007 anticipated the deterioration of the Sino-American relationship.
961600	968800	And you have to recall and remember how contrarian and unlikely such a prediction was in 2007.
968800	974160	I mean, remember that in the 2000s and certainly in the 90s, a dominant view was that China's
974160	977680	relationship with the West was only going to get better and better through economic
977680	979180	liberalization.
979180	984320	And I think such a view, which obviously seems hopelessly naive these days, was grounded
984320	988640	on two flawed premises that were accepted.
988640	993080	The first one was that China's rise would sort of lift the boats of the world economy
993080	997840	and make most people in the West richer through cheaper goods and therefore much happier.
997840	1000920	Many people in the West would be happy with China's rise.
1000920	1005760	And the second point, the second assumption that this optimistic view was grounded on
1005760	1009880	was that the increasing similarity between China and the West would lead to political
1009880	1010880	harmony.
1010880	1014600	The idea went something like, you know, as Chinese people started watching Western movies,
1014600	1017680	as they started idolizing American sports, as they wanted to send their kids to Ivy
1017680	1023240	Leagues, that their values would be much closer aligned to that of the Americans and therefore
1023240	1025040	much less conflictual.
1025840	1030720	Now, Gerard's memetic understanding of human nature enabled him to see through the flaws
1030720	1032760	of both assumptions.
1032760	1038760	On the first point, we are not rational, utility maximizing creatures, but social creatures
1038760	1041240	prone to relativistic comparison.
1041240	1046480	For Gerard, America would be more unsettled, even if it were richer, but its gap between
1046480	1048040	China and closed down.
1048040	1052520	The absolute increase in goods mattered little to humans compared to a change in relativistic
1052520	1054160	social standing.
1054160	1059080	And on the second point, Gerard believes that its similarity, rather than difference,
1059080	1063160	that causes individuals and nations to enter into conflict.
1063160	1068600	Desiring a similar set of objects would open up the two nations to a larger surface area
1068600	1072440	of competition and therefore potential conflict and even violence.
1072440	1078880	And so, at the peak of Sino-American optimism in 2007, and this was right before 2008, where
1078880	1083520	the congeniality between the East and the West had never been greater, Gerard stood
1083520	1089800	against the crowd and warned us of such a conflict, a conflict that will come from the
1089800	1094920	very mechanism that most thought would establish peace, trade.
1094920	1097360	Let me read you a quote directly from Gerard.
1097360	1101400	A conflict between the United States and China will follow.
1101400	1102400	Everything is in place.
1102400	1106160	But it will not necessarily occur on the military level at first.
1106160	1108560	Trade can transform very quickly into war.
1108560	1113360	From this point of view, we can reasonably fear a major clash between China and the United
1113360	1115680	States in coming decades.
1115680	1120600	This looming conflict between the United States and China has nothing to do with a clash of
1120600	1121600	civilizations.
1121600	1127560	In fact, the dispute is between two forms of capitalism that are becoming more and more
1127560	1128560	similar.
1128560	1129560	End quote.
1129560	1135360	Of course, 15 years later, Gerard proves depressingly correct.
1135360	1140400	We are in the midst of this very trade war, and relationships have deteriorated beyond
1140400	1143960	what most could have possibly imagined in the 2000s.
1143960	1149440	So I hope this is a satisfying, albeit somewhat startling, answer to your question of why
1149440	1151780	Gerard is worth engaging.
1151780	1157240	Not only does he help us understand and I think manage the part of ourselves most important
1157240	1163000	but previously opaque to us, I think his theory also enables us to understand the world and
1163000	1167600	human society in a different and often much more predictive light.
1167600	1171960	But before we jump too far ahead, if it's okay with you, I'd like to give an overview
1171960	1175040	on the structure of these lecture series as a whole.
1175040	1176040	Please do.
1176040	1179880	Why don't you take the lead and I'll jump in with questions and comments.
1179880	1180880	Great.
1180880	1186080	I have two goals over the next seven lectures, one theoretical and one practical.
1186080	1190680	Theoretically, I aim to give you an encompassing overview of Gerard's entire theory, from his
1190680	1196200	psychology to his theology, from his theory on human evolution to predictions for apocalypse,
1196200	1200120	from readings on Greek literature to his critique of modern institutions.
1200120	1203760	I will present to you the entirety of Gerard's system.
1203760	1208880	Practically, I wish to show you how this theoretical system applies to your life in
1208880	1213840	modern society through bountiful historical and contemporary examples.
1213840	1217960	We're going to analyze through a Gerardian lens, of course, celebrity advertisement,
1217960	1222320	romantic relationships, ritual sacrifice, the relationship between COVID and social
1222320	1227680	unrest, the invention of coinage, social media, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand,
1227680	1231800	the genesis of law, modern victimhood culture, the philosophical basis of innovation and
1231800	1234160	much, much more.
1234160	1238800	My goal is not to leave you stranded with sterile intellectual concepts, but to give
1238800	1245240	you a map with which you can identify the Gerardian forces animating our world and your
1245240	1249600	life in order to navigate its relatively choppy waters.
1249600	1257680	Now, I've prepared these lectures for a public audience at an intermediate undergraduate difficulty.
1257680	1262080	That is to say, it's not going to be a walk in the park, but no prerequisites are necessary
1262080	1263880	to understand these lectures.
1263880	1269280	Now, we are going to engage quite frequently with the Western philosophical canon, the
1269280	1272280	Hagels and Plato's and Rousseau's of the world.
1272280	1276520	We're also going to be engaged, perhaps even more frequently, with the world's literary
1276520	1281640	mythical canon, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Hindu hymn to Purusha, the Iliad, the Odyssey,
1281640	1288040	Sophocles, Shakespeare, but rest assured, all of these, along with core Gerardian concepts,
1288040	1291280	will be properly contextualized and introduced.
1291280	1295520	There's no prerequisites for these series of lectures other than interest.
1295520	1299720	Now, specifically, the ordering of these lectures are such.
1299720	1304640	This lecture, lecture one, will give an overview of Gerard's life and his work.
1304640	1309520	It is a condensed summary of this entire lecture series for people who are short on time but
1309520	1312680	still want to get a brief taste of Gerard, if you will.
1312680	1318120	Now, moving on, lecture two and three, we're going to discuss Gerard's psychology.
1318120	1322520	Gerard focuses on, as you probably can already tell, the memetic parts of human nature, our
1322520	1325080	capacity and tendency towards imitation.
1325840	1330200	Now, with this psychological grounding, in lectures four to seven, we will dive into
1330200	1335000	Gerard's philosophy of history, which starts from the very beginning, man's evolution
1335000	1339040	from ape, and goes to the very end, our imminent apocalypse.
1339040	1342680	Gerard thinks the world is literally going to end very, very soon.
1342680	1346640	Now, given that we're going to be talking about such weighty concepts such as apocalypse,
1346640	1351080	the literal end of the world, I wanted to throw out a quick disclaimer here so that I don't
1351080	1355040	receive either undeserved credit or misdirected anger.
1355040	1360120	All of the ideas I'm about to share with you are not mine, but the most charitable reconstruction
1360120	1361400	to Gerard.
1361400	1364040	This is not me, but my interpretation of Gerard.
1364040	1370400	Now, I have many theological, methodological, psychological disagreements, strong points
1370400	1375040	of contention with Gerard, and I could do a whole lecture series just on my reasons for
1375040	1380960	those disagreements, but this is not interpreting B, it's interpreting Gerard.
1380960	1385480	I will present to you the most charitable interpretation of Gerard I can muster, even
1385480	1390400	if I privately disagree with him, some of them at least, because I've been taught in
1390400	1396280	a philosophical, pedagogical tradition that sees the lecture, me, not as a door-to-door
1396280	1402480	salesman of a single product, but as a wandering merchant with a whole caravan of goods.
1402480	1406960	I shouldn't be in the business of knocking down your door and shoving my single ideas
1406960	1409760	down your throat, regardless of what your needs are.
1409760	1415800	Instead, I should open up my little merchant caravan of ideas and try to argue the best
1415800	1421000	I can for each idea in my inventory for why they are attractive so that you, the listener,
1421000	1424240	can have the agency to make that decision.
1424240	1429600	But before I show you my Gerardian wear, so to speak, let me give you a brief introduction
1429600	1433400	about the man behind the theory.
1433400	1442440	On December 25, 1923, Ren√© No√´l Theophile Gerard was born as the second of five children
1442440	1448680	to a Catholic, learned mother and an anticlerical archivist father in Avignon, France.
1448680	1452400	Gerard's father had served, he'd lost a brother, he'd been wounded himself in World
1452400	1457760	War I, and passed his views on the meaninglessness of conflict onto Gerard.
1457760	1461680	And I think this view was further corroborated as Gerard spent his formative adolescent years
1461680	1464000	in France under Nazi occupation.
1464000	1470000	Now, of course, as anyone in that place and that time period, the cruelty of the Nazis
1470000	1471640	left an imprint on Gerard.
1471640	1475960	But so did the cruelty of the French resistance.
1475960	1480640	You see, once they had been liberated by the Allies, the French resistance, now in control
1480640	1486480	of France, started scapegoating and persecuting anyone who had tangential affiliations to the
1486480	1489320	Nazis during the time of occupation.
1489320	1491640	Often these victims were innocent.
1491640	1496000	Many innocents, mostly women too vulnerable to defend themselves, were scapegoated by
1496000	1498960	the French mob, blamed for Nazi collaboration.
1498960	1503160	They were humiliated, dragged around on the street, and often killed without trial on
1503160	1505240	groundless accusations.
1505240	1511040	Let me read you of the vivid scenes depicted by Gerard's biographer.
1511040	1515480	Some of them were young mothers with no means of support, motivated by hunger and need rather
1515480	1518040	than by treason or even desire.
1518040	1523160	Some were unmarried schoolteachers who were forced to meet with German soldiers in their
1523160	1524160	homes.
1524160	1528520	Others were restless teenage girls who just flirted with the foreign soldiers.
1528520	1532760	One was a charwoman who cleaned the German military headquarters.
1532760	1537800	There were no trials, only stylized rituals of retribution, a shameful carnival that
1537800	1543280	often included stripping these women to their underwear and loading them onto trucks to drive
1543280	1544960	around the town.
1544960	1550560	They were exhibited to the sound of drum rolls shouting and cat calls, as if the trucks
1550560	1558280	were tumbles in 1789 the French Revolution had come alive again.
1558280	1565000	These scenes of innocence being scapegoated will leave a lasting imprint on Gerard and
1565000	1569700	be a common thread throughout his work, both the meanlessness, deceitfulness, and arbitrariness
1569700	1575140	of conflict, and the perennial need of troubled human societies to find innocent victims to
1575140	1578300	blame and murder for catharsis.
1578300	1584020	Now, Gerard's intellectual trajectory, on the other hand, could be described as anti-institutional
1584020	1586020	and unorthodox through and through.
1586020	1588020	He was always an outsider.
1588020	1591740	He was an outsider from the very beginning, unable to bear regular school.
1591740	1596340	He had to go to a private tutoring program, reading at his heart's content and not to
1596340	1598460	the dictates of any syllabus.
1598460	1603820	He was trained in Indiana University in history, but his generative curiosity soon overflowed
1603820	1606540	the boundaries of his diploma.
1606540	1610980	He made little contributions to history and was self-taught and an outsider in all the
1610980	1613900	major fields that he did actually contribute to.
1613900	1618820	First, he made his mark in literary theory by articulating the idea of memesis through
1618820	1620780	close readings of literature.
1620780	1626980	Next, he jumped disciplines into anthropology, where he shed light on the need for scapegoating,
1626980	1632340	and then he jumped disciplines once more to theology, mounting a serious defense for
1632340	1633340	Christianity.
1633340	1638620	Now, despite being accepted into the prestigious French Academy and holding professorships
1638620	1644180	at John Hopkins, Buffalo, and Stanford, Gerard still remains, to some extent, an outsider
1644180	1645820	in all of these disciplines.
1645820	1649300	The literary theorists have been with him for not respecting the methods and conventions
1649300	1650820	and fashions of the day.
1650820	1655900	The anthropologists distrust his liberal use of evidence and lack of field work, and even
1655900	1660500	parts of the Christian community have shunned him for his quite unorthodox reading of the
1660500	1661500	crucifixion.
1661500	1668260	So, the title of this lecture series is called Interpreting Gerard, Exigit of Apocalypse.
1668260	1669940	Why do you call him an exigit?
1669940	1673820	Why not philosopher or maybe something more provocative like prophet?
1673820	1676860	Yeah, yeah, well, that's a good question.
1676860	1681340	We're not in the business of drama here, so I think I skipped prophet, but mostly I
1681340	1685700	call him an exigit because that's what he called himself, and I wanted to have respect
1685700	1687380	for his self-conception.
1687380	1692460	You see, he explicitly, in interviews, rejected both terms, philosopher and prophet, and I
1692460	1696100	think it would just simply be too narrow to call him a literary theorist, an anthropologist,
1696100	1697100	or a theologian.
1697100	1703780	Now, an exigit is someone who performs exegesis, the interpretation of scripture.
1703780	1708580	And I think that is the most accurate way to understand Gerard's system and the vast
1708580	1710900	terrain that he is forced to traverse.
1710900	1716420	You know, he's less a careful analytical philosopher, but a visionary expanding and
1716420	1722580	articulating a moral insight informed by scripture through all of these domains.
1722580	1727660	I get a feeling that reading Gerard, for him, these vast domains weren't these divergent
1727660	1731580	disciplines, these separate buckets that he was dipping his toes into, but simply different
1731580	1734620	manifestations of the same core insight.
1734620	1740580	And I think Gerard's aim wasn't to revolutionize literary criticism, anthropology, or theology,
1740580	1746660	but to articulate what he conceived to be the core insight of Christianity.
1746660	1751580	Now that we have some context on Gerard the man, let's move on to the meat and bones,
1751580	1756500	the meat and potatoes of this lecture, which is a brief summary of Gerard's system.
1756500	1761380	I will attempt to give a reduced and simplistic summary of this entire lecture series, which
1761380	1767180	covers the entirety of memetic theory, sharing with you Gerard's key concepts and conclusions,
1767180	1771700	but probably not the full reasons and repercussions behind these conclusions.
1771700	1774620	Here I will trade precision for breadth.
1774620	1778700	Now for people who don't have the time for the full 10 plus hour lecture series, first
1778700	1783220	shame on you, but secondly, this could be a summary that should be sufficient for you
1783220	1785420	to get a taste of Gerard.
1785420	1791700	Now for those who are embarking on the full journey with us, I think this summary can be
1791700	1798340	a map for the expansive, tumultuous, and dizzying terrain ahead for you to gain your
1798340	1802060	sea legs and get an orientation of the landscape.
1802060	1806060	The best way for me to give you a taste of Gerard's system in one telling is to give
1806060	1811460	a comprehensive history of humanity, beginning from man's evolution from ape, all the way
1811460	1813100	to apocalypse.
1813100	1817780	I'll start by summarizing Gerard's psychology, how he thought humans were psychologically
1817780	1823060	different from animals, then I will articulate the problems this unique psychology created
1823060	1826620	for early human societies and their respective solutions.
1826620	1831780	And after that, I will detail how Christianity represents a meaningful rupture for Gerard
1831780	1833620	from these early societies.
1833620	1838540	And lastly, I will articulate how Christianity brought us all the way here to majority and
1838540	1842780	how it will imminently deliver us to violent apocalypse.
1842780	1844780	So let us begin with psychology.
1844780	1852260	Gerard's apocalyptic conclusions begin with a rather innocuous observation, mimesis.
1852260	1858700	What defined for Gerard are evolutionary breaking away from our great ape cousins is not reason,
1858700	1866060	it's not truth, it's mimesis, our gradually increasing capacity and tendency for imitation.
1866060	1871100	The best metaphor I can think of to explain mimesis is that of co-vibrating violin strings.
1871100	1876460	When you put two violin strings together in close proximity, as you flick one, a similar
1876460	1879420	frequency of vibrational translate to the other.
1879420	1883980	And I think in a like manner, Gerard identifies a species of human behavior, and here I use
1883980	1889740	behavior for the lack of a better word in the largest sense possible, actions, experiences,
1889740	1896180	judgments, intentions, that proceed also from copying an external instance of that behavior.
1896740	1902260	Now humans are social animals through and through, prone to this type of co-vibration.
1902260	1906620	Just as strings on a violin aren't independent, neither are we.
1906620	1912740	Mimesis is the fundamental capacity and tendency to gain access to the subjectivity of others,
1912740	1915980	as well as to reproduce objective cultural forms.
1915980	1921300	In other words, mimesis is what constitutes us as social beings, and makes us different
1921300	1923780	from other animals.
1924180	1929660	This tendency to ingest the behaviors and values what have you of those around us is
1929660	1934980	why perhaps prestige and recognition matter so much to us humans.
1934980	1938820	When a majority of a social group that you're immersed in believe something is good or beautiful
1938820	1943660	or believe something should be done in this way or that, we tend to slowly take on and
1943660	1946540	ingest those positions as well through mimesis.
1946540	1951060	And I think our everyday notions of prestige already have an understanding of mimesis.
1951460	1955420	When we say something is prestigious, we are perhaps also saying that on its own it
1955420	1958780	does not deserve the value we attribute to it, right?
1958780	1964340	When we call prestigious, Rolex, Harvard, Bentley, maybe not Cornell, but the other
1964340	1969140	actual prestigious things, partially what we're saying is that the value we attribute
1969140	1975260	to it is not fully accounted for by the objects themselves, but that there's some surplus
1975260	1977580	value where the object doesn't deserve.
1977660	1982700	Gerard would say that that surplus value does not come from the object, but our peers value
1982700	1986100	it and us ingesting their opinions through mimesis.
1986100	1992020	Now for Gerard, mimesis in everything, but everything to some degree is memetic.
1992020	1996260	The rush of adrenaline that infects you in a roaring and lively sporting stadium, the
1996260	2001020	tribalism of politics, the madness of cults and how they sustain each other's delusions,
2001020	2006180	the passing on of accents, even as animal, as an activity of replenishing ourselves
2006260	2011340	drinking water, we may still call to mind, however subtly, how our favorite athletes
2011340	2012300	drinks a Gatorade, right?
2012300	2015140	That's the purpose of those commercials to get that in your head.
2015140	2018700	This is how broad and all pervasive mimesis operates.
2018700	2023820	Humanity for Gerard would be completely unrecognizable without it.
2023820	2028260	The species of a memetic behavior that most concerns Gerard in both senses of the word
2028260	2029260	is desire.
2029260	2035020	It's fine and dandy when what mimesis transmits is accents or cultural codes, but when mimesis
2035020	2040460	converges the desires of people, well, that invites them into competition, conflict, and
2040460	2042740	often violence.
2042740	2047100	Gerard separates the entirety of human desires into two species.
2047100	2052260	The desire to be, which he terms metaphysical desire, and the desire to experience, which
2052260	2055020	he terms physical desire.
2055020	2058940	Metaphysical desire is directed at what objects say about me.
2058940	2063780	Physical desire is directed at an experience confirmed by the qualities of the object
2063780	2064780	itself.
2065220	2067500	Let me give you a few examples to clarify.
2067500	2072500	I can pursue, for example, sex for the experience out of physical desire, and what I would be
2072500	2077700	after there would be pleasure or intimacy, feelings in the moment, but I can also pursue
2077700	2083340	sex for being, what having sex with a certain type of person really says about me, right?
2083340	2086340	And this is a real psychology that people have.
2086340	2089900	This is the psychology of the Don Juan or the Coquette.
2089900	2094300	For these people, sex is no longer about sex, but something more core to their identity.
2094780	2098540	They are not out there to experience something, but to prove something.
2098540	2100940	Or take another more trivial and mundane example.
2100940	2103460	I can buy a car for the experience.
2103460	2107500	The trouble it would save me from walking everywhere, but I can also buy a car because
2107500	2111140	I want to be a certain type of person because I just want to have the coolest car on the
2111140	2114060	block and have people admire me.
2114060	2118140	You, for example, David, I must applaud you because clearly from your car, I can tell
2118140	2120060	that you're a very saintly man.
2120060	2123140	Clearly you do not care what the car says about you.
2123140	2126020	You are freed from metaphysical desire in this domain.
2126020	2127020	Congratulations.
2127020	2128020	I don't want to hear it.
2128020	2129540	My Toyota is beautiful, John.
2129540	2132380	Just please don't stop driving.
2132380	2137580	A reductive, but hopefully illuminating way to put this is that physical desire aims
2137580	2141740	at utility whereas metaphysical desire aims at identity.
2141740	2146980	Now, certainly this boundary between experience and being, between utility and identity is
2146980	2147980	not so clear.
2147980	2152500	You know, who we concede ourselves to be colors our experiences as much as our experiences
2152540	2158220	if ever so subtly shapes our self-conception, but just think about how drastically different
2158220	2159220	these experiences are.
2159220	2160220	Right?
2160220	2163700	Think about pursuing a profession because the work is engaging versus doing it because
2163700	2169660	it's the right job to have or dating a person because you like spending time with them versus
2169660	2175020	dating some person because you like to be seen with them or traveling to a place because
2175020	2181580	you're interested in the culture or because you just want to be seen in the coolest locale.
2181980	2186980	The distinction that Gerard has drawn here, if a bit muddied, is nonetheless meaningful,
2186980	2189620	especially at the extremes.
2189620	2195140	This desire to be at the heart of metaphysical desire is aimed at a fullness of being.
2195140	2200060	We want to exist, Gerard believes, in great measure.
2200060	2205340	Metaphysical desire takes form as a pursuit of objects in the broadest sense of the term.
2205340	2208980	Wanted to climb Mount Everest, wanted to build a unicorn company, wanted to study at an Ivy
2209060	2214980	League, or more mundane, buying a particular car, dating Sally instead of Susan, enjoying
2214980	2216580	a fancy restaurant.
2216580	2222100	But in all of these experiences, Gerard would say it's never objects we are really after.
2222100	2227460	I don't think this is a foreign concept to our this-worldly, achievement-focused consumer
2227460	2228460	society.
2228460	2233740	We want to acquire objects to bolster and back up our identity.
2233740	2238580	And the way we go about choosing which objects to go after, Gerard believes, is imitating
2238580	2243060	individuals whom we already consider to possess this fullness of being.
2243060	2247780	Celebrities, parental figures, entrepreneurs, and outstanding co-worker, we take on their
2247780	2249620	desires as our own.
2249620	2253740	The objects they value, as the objects we also strive for.
2253740	2259180	The faulty logic here, being that it must be the acquisition of these objects that grant
2259180	2261300	these models the fullness of their being.
2261300	2265860	Yeah, this reminds me of celebrity advertisements.
2265860	2267100	It does indeed, right?
2267100	2269500	You see a celebrity and you want what they want.
2269500	2272140	That's the whole logic behind these advertisements.
2272140	2276700	And I think the one line in celebrity advertisement that gives it all away is the tagline for
2276700	2280700	Jordan, Michael Jordan, sneakers, be like Mike.
2280700	2286180	What it's promising you isn't just a product or utility, but the being and prestige of
2286180	2290100	Michael Jordan, so that you can have a piece of that as well.
2290100	2291540	It's not jump like Mike.
2291540	2293300	It's not score like Mike.
2293300	2297900	The advertisement of basketball shoes doesn't talk about anything of the most important
2297900	2301940	physical qualities of the basketball shoes, and the lightness, the grip, the bounce.
2301940	2308700	It's promising you something you want all the more, being, be like Mike.
2308700	2313340	Draught's central thesis is that what often appears to be a subject pulled towards an
2313340	2317980	object due to the intrinsic value of that object is really the subject wanting to acquire
2317980	2320420	that object to be like some model.
2320500	2324620	What we are really after isn't the object, but the being of the model.
2324620	2330300	Whereas we think of desire as unidirectional, flowing from subject to object.
2330300	2335140	Draught thinks it's actually triangular, proceeding from subject through a model to
2335140	2337140	the object.
2337140	2342300	Because what is at stake in metaphysical desire is our identity, it is the strongest drive
2342300	2344660	in the human motivational repertoire.
2344660	2348940	I think it's quite obvious when we are motivated by such a drive because we can become obsessed
2348940	2350300	and compulsive.
2350300	2355300	We think that achievement, obtaining the objects that metaphysical desire wants, will
2355300	2357060	fully transform us.
2357060	2361220	I think in different stages of our lives, metaphysical desire usually directs us towards
2361220	2363500	a limited set of objects.
2363500	2367420	For me, first it was a specific toy that I really wanted, and then a weapon in World
2367420	2371740	of Warcraft, and then dating a person, and then an Ivy League, etc., etc.
2371740	2376380	I think we're always oriented at different stages in our lives towards something.
2376740	2381300	These are the objects pointed to by metaphysical desire.
2381300	2386700	These are objects in each period of our life that take on a disproportionate weight such
2386700	2390460	that you define progress as inching towards the object.
2390460	2395780	And whenever it slips away, however subtly, however minutely, your heart just thuds and
2395780	2400220	you feel a deep existential despair.
2400220	2404100	Romance provides a good example here.
2404180	2408020	Then you won't even be after the woman that you're interested in, and you won't be that
2408020	2409020	interested.
2409020	2414500	And what will happen is all of a sudden there's another suitor who comes along, and they are
2414500	2415500	interested in this woman.
2415500	2419780	And all of a sudden you get excited about this person too, and it is in that competition
2419780	2425100	that we are inflamed by the memetic spirit.
2425100	2428420	But then there's a second point here about this existential dread that we can feel.
2428420	2434180	We never feel those tremendous highs and lows in the early stages of talking to a woman
2434180	2438700	or something, and you'll be so excited because the texting is going well, and you'll be skipping
2438700	2442420	down the halls, and then all of a sudden she won't respond.
2442420	2445220	And you're freaking out, you're texting your friends what's going on here, you can't sleep
2445220	2451220	that night, and you wake up in the next morning, your alarm clock goes off, and you see a text,
2451220	2452220	and she's responded.
2452220	2456780	Now you jump out of bed and you wake up faster than a double shot of espresso.
2456780	2458700	That's precisely the right example to think of.
2458700	2463180	In fact, Drard would commonly go to romance as his canonical examples of metaphysical
2463180	2465580	desire and these two qualities you mentioned.
2465580	2472340	First, the object, not contributing anything or too much to desire, as well as these bipolar
2472340	2473340	swings.
2473340	2478020	All make romance, or at least the iterations you've described as textbook examples of
2478020	2479460	metaphysical desire.
2479460	2486420	And look, Drard's point is even in as intimate a domain as romance, our desires are, if you'd
2486420	2491060	excuse upon, helplessly penetrated by those of others.
2491060	2496300	Even our desires for our partners tend not to be informed fully by our partners, but
2496300	2497900	by people around them.
2497900	2503820	Drard's point is if even such a personal desire can be so external in origin, then
2503820	2507700	the same must also be true for other domains as well.
2507700	2512340	Career choice, political orientation, aesthetic taste, philosophical opinions.
2512340	2518660	This is a full-scale attack on the modern conception of individuals who can form their
2518660	2524580	own decisions with the reason to have an authentic core of desires to tap into.
2524580	2530660	Now, if this attack was not already threatening enough, Drard's next point will make it all
2530660	2535100	the more so and further problematize authenticity.
2535100	2539820	Just as memesis and metaphysical desire can make people conform, they can also make people
2539820	2541820	diverge.
2541820	2546540	But in another way, even a breaking away from the group in a so-called carving one's own
2546540	2549540	path can be radically socially determined.
2549540	2555340	When I think about it like this, the logic of metaphysical desire is to pursue the objects
2555340	2558820	associated with those who do have a fullness of being, right?
2558820	2564820	And so a natural continuation of this logic is to avoid or distance oneself from objects
2564820	2569580	associated with those we conceive to be as having a deficiency in being.
2569580	2574460	We both want to be like the cool kids, but also distant and be different from the social
2574460	2575460	outcasts.
2575460	2577180	Here's an example.
2577180	2582060	The tech elite with their plain t-shirts are not independent from Drard's perspective,
2582060	2585380	from the status games of finance-finally-addressed elite.
2585380	2590660	Even though they appear to be rejecting that game, in reality, it's merely the continuation
2590660	2593300	of the same game in a more accelerated form.
2593300	2598540	And when you think about it like this, showing up with a $5 t-shirt to a dinner where everyone
2598580	2603500	was wearing $500 suits is, in some sense, much more of a power play than showing up
2603500	2606220	with a $5,000 suit to the same dinner.
2606220	2610060	Because it's saying that I am so much better than you, that we aren't even playing the
2610060	2617020	same game, that I take your highest values, what you hold most here, as vulgar as nothing.
2617020	2621500	This is the logic of the negative phase of the mimesis, to distance oneself in order
2621500	2623780	to show one's superiority.
2623780	2628940	This breaking away from a group is no more authentic or independent than conformity,
2628940	2633700	because your choices are still made for what they say about you and not the object itself.
2633700	2638820	Now, in my own life decisions, if I may share a bit of a personal story, I think I've been
2638820	2644420	led astray by both the positive and the negative forces of mimesis.
2644420	2648940	I grew up idolizing entrepreneurs, the Steve Jobs of the world, and as soon as I got into
2648940	2653220	college, I felt like I had to drop out and start a company, ASAP.
2653220	2653980	And so I did.
2653980	2659220	My freshman spring, I dropped out, I raised a small round, and the company crashed and
2659220	2661020	burned out of vanity.
2661020	2664780	And it's not that I didn't enjoy building companies, that's not why I was led astray
2664780	2670060	by mimesis, but the degree to which I desired it, and the urgency of which I felt like I
2670060	2674860	had to achieve it, not unlike your romance example, was disproportionate to the value
2674860	2676740	of the object itself.
2676740	2682100	In other words, I desired being an entrepreneur and not necessarily the processes of building
2682100	2684060	a company.
2684060	2688620	Now, when I did go back to school as a sophomore a semester later, out of resentment for my
2688620	2694300	peers who had dropped out and did build successful companies, I think I went the other direction,
2694300	2698860	rejecting the worldly altogether, switching from CS to philosophy, going to a Buddhist
2698860	2700260	monastery.
2700260	2704700	For three years, I didn't do that much at all in industry, out of resentment.
2704700	2711540	Now, rejecting industry and building companies was my moral weapon to secure victory over
2711540	2717220	my more successful peers, to turn my failure into a triumph, but this was equally, if not
2717220	2719540	more inauthentic and perverse.
2719540	2724740	Now, the same story goes, it's not that I didn't enjoy philosophy and Buddhism, but
2724740	2728380	the degree to which I pursued it, and certainly the degree to which I renounced the world
2728380	2729580	was not genuine.
2729580	2733940	It wasn't reflective of how much I liked philosophical and meditative practice, and
2733940	2739460	certainly not how much I disliked the worldly, active life of industry.
2739460	2744460	And I think I really did miss out on valuable career opportunities because I was too resentful
2744460	2746260	to engage.
2746260	2750540	This carving of my own path was just as socially determined.
2750540	2754740	It was a form of coping so that I didn't have to feel lesser than my more successful
2754740	2756700	peers.
2756700	2762420	As a society, I think we all recognize this first move of conforming to this dropout culture
2762420	2767300	as socially determined, as prestige seeking, as not authentic, but I think the second move
2767300	2772740	of rejecting the group is just as socially determined, in that it was still primarily
2772740	2779020	the relationships with people that determined my choices, not for the choices themselves.
2779020	2783540	Admiration led me to converge in the first case, and resentment led me to diverge in
2783540	2784820	the second.
2784820	2788540	The direction is different, but the essence is the same.
2788540	2793260	But of course, in our society, to break away from the group, to carve one's own path,
2793260	2799340	so to speak, is thought to be a sure sign of independence, but that is not so.
2799340	2804180	Drard here is trying to tear down what he conceives of as the romantic lie.
2804180	2806860	The lie goes something like this.
2806860	2811540	At the bottom, we are all individuals, with a core of what we can call the authentic self.
2811540	2815740	And then there are these layers of social constraints, one on top of the other, with
2815740	2817980	the origins external.
2817980	2823580	The way to access authenticity, so this romantic lie goes, is by following one's heart, with
2823580	2829820	a bold, breaking free of the group, peeling away of these social layers.
2829820	2832220	Drard says not so fast.
2832220	2838420	This breaking free from the group can be just as socially determined as rigid adherence.
2838420	2843500	You're confusing difference for autonomy, you're confusing distance for independence,
2843500	2846700	and you're confusing originality for freedom.
2846700	2853100	The reality is, we can just as easily be socially determined by rejecting a group out of resentment,
2853100	2857460	as we can by conforming to the group out of admiration or peer pressure.
2857460	2861260	Memesis operates positively and negatively.
2861260	2867100	Memesis and metaphysical desire then, entrap us in every direction, both in conforming as
2867100	2868980	well as in breaking free.
2868980	2872260	Man is shown to be a social creature through and through.
2872260	2875820	If you take one thing from Drard's psychology, it is this.
2875820	2882220	The most powerful and explanatory element within the human psyche is our sociality.
2882220	2887620	Our values, our political orientation, aesthetic taste, and even philosophical positions are
2887620	2893780	heavily, often primarily, determined by others in deep and often unconscious ways, and not
2893780	2896100	chosen for their own sake.
2896100	2898140	We may think our desires are our own.
2898140	2902620	We may think we desire our spouse just because of who they are, or at the very least because
2902620	2906540	of their physical attractiveness, but Drard shows that even this turns out not to be the
2906540	2908420	full extent of the story.
2908420	2913780	We may think reason can hold the reins and guide our decisions, but this social dimension
2913780	2918060	of ourselves is often much, much stronger.
2918060	2924460	Reason pretends to be its steward, but in reality is its lawyer and spokesperson, engaged
2924460	2927740	in, more often than not, post-hog rationalization.
2927740	2931660	Oh yeah, of course, you know, I want to be an entrepreneur because I want to change the
2931660	2933180	world for the better.
2933180	2937620	Or on the other hand, of course, I would never be an entrepreneur because industry is vulgar
2937620	2939900	and capitalism is immoral.
2939900	2944540	The reasons we give for our decisions often come after we've already sworn allegiance
2944540	2948100	to those decisions due to ulterior social motives.
2948100	2953740	Now for Drard, our memetic natures, the extent to which we are socially determined, is what
2953740	2961100	differentiates us from animals and the main direction of human evolution from ape.
2961100	2967540	This direction of evolution is not, as commonly thought, the increase of our ability to reason
2967540	2969580	and grasp truth.
2969580	2974420	After all, Drard would say, other animals engage in truth-seeking behaviors as well.
2974420	2978460	There's echolocation, there's tapping into magnetic fields, there's night vision, these
2978460	2981260	are all truth-seeking activities.
2981260	2987700	But we are the only animals who create gods, who tell stories, who spin up fictions, who
2987700	2992940	would go to war for an abstract conception of honor which can neither taste nor smell
2992940	2998340	nor touch, who would trade food and shelter for pieces of paper, who would die for myths
2998340	3002220	and gods that clearly never even existed.
3002220	3004260	Animals are the sober ones.
3004260	3006860	We are the nut jobs.
3006860	3012580	What makes us unique for Drard is not our ability to determine truth, but our capacity
3012660	3018100	to believe in lies insofar as others around us do as well.
3018100	3022820	For the modern mind, this is a deeply alien conception of human nature, and it opens a
3022820	3025420	Pandora's box of questions.
3025420	3030700	What does it mean to protect individual freedom if we, like co-vibrating vile in-strings, are
3030700	3033820	never truly free to begin with?
3033820	3038980	How can we follow our own authentic desires if every part of our psyche is so helplessly
3038980	3041020	external in its origin?
3041020	3044980	How is the democratic process not as arbitrary as the whims of a single dictator if we are
3044980	3048780	so easily influenced and swayed by the mob?
3048780	3052940	These will have to remain questions for now, wrestled with over the course of the next
3052940	3058940	seven lectures, because memesis presents us a much more pressing and threatening problem
3058940	3063180	in this evolutionary story that we must now turn to.
3063180	3066620	Everything we've talked about up until this point, what we've discussed so far, are the
3066620	3070060	core psychological faculties that define humanity.
3070060	3075980	And now, let us jump back into Gerard's history to see the unique challenges which this psychology
3075980	3076980	brings about.
3076980	3080820	We are officially moving from psychology to history.
3080820	3084700	As early humans evolved to be more and more memetic, the simple dominance hierarchies
3084700	3087820	that were able to contain animal groups started breaking down.
3087820	3090060	The idea is to go something like this.
3090060	3094180	Dominance hierarchies, where there's a clear chain of alpha to beta to gamma all the way
3094180	3097540	to omega, works fine if there's little memesis.
3097540	3101720	Even so far as the beta doesn't desire what the alpha has, and the gamma doesn't desire
3101720	3104540	what the beta has, then all is well.
3104540	3109300	But the memetic tendency of early humans started to become so strong that there started
3109300	3114580	to be frequent cross-pollinization of desires across the hierarchy.
3114580	3118740	Metaphysical desire, at least the strength of it, is unique to humans, and this lets
3118740	3122780	subjects to enter into rivalry with their models.
3122780	3127940	Converging and competing metaphysical desires would rip social groups apart in wars of all
3127940	3133100	against all, destroying all those societies that were involved.
3133100	3138740	Gerard reasons that the only hominoid groups that survived and formed lasting cultures
3138740	3145020	were ones that stumbled upon a unique cultural technology to stop this escalating conflict,
3145020	3149100	and that he called the scapegoat mechanism.
3149100	3154100	In the midst of such a war of all against all, I think a civil war, a French revolution,
3154100	3159660	when society is an utter chaos, society's Gerard observes often converge upon a single
3159660	3165460	victim or a small set of victims, attributing to them all the blame and frustrations of
3165460	3168020	the chaos that they're in.
3168020	3174460	Now is this like a rational process, similar to the way that a jury sentences a victim?
3174460	3176900	Or what should I have in mind here?
3177100	3182100	Yeah, it's not a rational process, it's not a committee that, say, picks the victim,
3182100	3186700	but a somewhat random process, where certain accusations against certain people just start
3186700	3191220	gaining steam until the whole group falls under its spell.
3191220	3196340	Think about the randomness of the French Revolution rather than a calculated drone strike.
3196340	3198940	I think that's what you should have in mind here.
3198940	3203660	This victim, if not fully innocent, certainly does not deserve the extent of the blame
3203660	3205100	leveled on him.
3205100	3209700	This group is always deceitful, and their certainty is only bolstered by unanimity,
3209700	3213620	the fact that everyone believes in the victim's guilt.
3213620	3219100	This victim will be expelled, often murdered, very brutally, as the group gains a cathartic
3219100	3222860	release and peace is restored.
3222860	3228060	There are, unfortunately, too many examples of innocent scapegoats throughout human history.
3228060	3231620	Think about Socrates' trial and death at the hands of the Athenian jury.
3231620	3235380	Think about the Black Death, which was blamed on witches and witchcraft.
3235380	3238940	Think about the Nazis scapegoating the Jews for German decline.
3238940	3244700	Think about McCarthy-era witch hunts, persecuting innocents under the crimes of communism.
3244700	3249180	It's not enough, Gerard reasons, for us to find guilty parties, but we want to find one
3249180	3253700	radical source of evil to blame everything upon.
3253700	3258900	With the scapegoat mechanism, Gerard is highlighting the perennial need of human societies in times
3258900	3263980	of chaos to identify a single source to blame and murder.
3263980	3270100	To truly establish a peaceful society in a time of turmoil, this murder must be maximally
3270100	3277900	cathartic and as a result, has to be maximally violent and deceitful, often blaming a singular
3277900	3282860	victim for the entirety of the society's problems.
3282860	3287300	Gerard thinks that this murder is wrong, that it's based on a lie, that it's regrettable,
3287500	3292860	that it should not be done, but it worked, and it was the only thing that worked, which
3292860	3296100	kept early human societies alive.
3296100	3300140	To make sense of Gerard's claim here, because this is quite a radical claim on the violent
3300140	3306380	foundations of society, we must go back and think about Gerard's psychology.
3306380	3311140	For every social philosophy, I would wager, that we must ask who the subject is.
3311140	3313020	For Marx, the subject is class.
3313020	3314900	For fascism, it is the nation state.
3314900	3317060	For Augustine, it is a Christian soul.
3317060	3319620	For liberalism, it is a rational agent.
3319620	3325620	Gerard's subject of his social philosophy is the spirited animal.
3325620	3331060	Not one who thinks in terms of utility in numbers, but vengeance and pride, honor and
3331060	3334980	being, who experiences envy and resentment.
3334980	3341380	Now, for such a social creature, the primary mechanisms that govern him isn't consensus.
3341380	3343020	It's not the mandate of heaven.
3343020	3344180	It's not the common good.
3344180	3348260	It's certainly not rational political discourse.
3348260	3354100	For Gerard, we aren't rational agents interested in a systematic analysis and nuanced solution,
3354100	3360140	but social spirited creatures needing a cathartic release against their radical evil.
3360140	3366420	In moments of extreme turbulence, we are interested in truth, but a grand lie and founding murder
3366420	3368980	that can grant us catharsis.
3368980	3371900	The lie, however, goes even further.
3371900	3375220	While this no longer happens in modernity for reasons that we'll have to explore a
3375220	3381180	bit later on, in early pagan societies, the peace that descended onto the crowd would
3381180	3387420	be so miraculous, so instantaneous and unbelievable that people would struggle to make sense of
3387420	3389100	what had just happened.
3389100	3393900	How did we go from being at each other's throats to being fully reconciled?
3393900	3399740	And so, just as deceitfully as the crowd would blame the victim for causing chaos, they now
3399900	3406660	deceitfully praise the now dead victim for ending the chaos, turning the victim paradoxically
3406660	3407660	into a god.
3407660	3411980	Gerard's point is that the scapegoat mechanism is such a unanimous process.
3411980	3416980	People feel so justified in their expulsion that they don't even feel their own agency.
3416980	3420300	And so, they don't see themselves as bringing peace.
3420300	3424860	All they have in view is the victim and reasons that it must be the victim that has brought
3424860	3425960	us that peace.
3425960	3428620	The victim must be a god.
3428620	3434380	These pagan gods are all powerful, with the power to begin and end destruction.
3434380	3438540	These gods are seen as both good and evil.
3438540	3443180	The example Gerard will point to is the story of Oedipus, as told by Sophocles.
3443180	3446980	Now, we're going to spend an entire lecture with Oedipus, but let me give you a very,
3446980	3448820	very brief outline first.
3448820	3454060	And Oedipus is a new king of thebes that is being ravaged by a plague.
3454060	3459940	Oedipus is guilty of having committed both patricide, killing of one's father, as well
3459940	3463540	as incest, of having sex with one's mother.
3463540	3469180	Because of this, the entire city blames Oedipus for causing the plague and expels him.
3469180	3473300	The people get their catharsis and the plague goes away.
3473300	3480380	Oedipus wanders the Greek states, and as time progresses, something very, very strange happens.
3480380	3485380	Rather than only being an object of scorn that everyone wants to expel to distance from,
3485380	3488900	people are now competing to invite Oedipus into their lands.
3488900	3495660	See a prophecy has gained momentum in Greece, that wherever Oedipus's remains will be buried,
3495660	3498380	shall be granted lasting peace.
3498380	3502500	And in this Oedipus myth, then, we see both movements of the scapegoat mechanism.
3502500	3503500	Right?
3503500	3504500	First, we see the scapegoating.
3504500	3509220	Oedipus might have been morally bankrupt for patricide and incest, but it was certainly
3509220	3513060	an exaggerated lie to think that he was the cause of the entire plague, right?
3513060	3516300	His expulsion was a groundless lie.
3516300	3520300	Second, we see the movement of divinization.
3520300	3524860	As Oedipus's expulsion brought about lasting peace through catharsis, he started to gain
3524860	3531340	a dual character, still evil for causing the plague, but also radically good with the power
3531340	3534100	to end plagues and bring peace.
3534100	3539180	Oedipus, at the end of the story, has been divinized, or at least fetishized.
3539180	3544700	Gerard's claim is that in all pagan religions, we can find traces of a once-victim-turned-god
3544700	3546900	at the foundation of the culture.
3546900	3551340	We will investigate, in due course, across this entire lecture series, the Nordic myth
3551340	3556220	of Baldur's death that resembles a collective expulsion, the Greek myth of the birth of
3556220	3561980	Zeus and its eerie similarities to murder, and the Hindu hymn to Purusha, where a Genesis
3561980	3567700	deity is sacrificed with his remains giving birth to Hindu society and its caste.
3567700	3571940	It's not just religions, however, that are born from the scapegoat mechanism, but pagan
3571940	3574660	culture and society as well.
3574660	3580220	Take the example of Julius Caesar, who is the victim-turned-god of the Roman Imperium.
3580220	3585420	In the story of Caesar, we also find the key movements of the scapegoat mechanism.
3585420	3589940	First, Roman society is in a state of utter chaos and civil war.
3589940	3596460	Julius Caesar is famously scapegoated, blamed, and collectively murdered on the Senate floor.
3596460	3601660	Zeus does not come immediately to Rome indeed, but it does come at the hand of another Caesar,
3601660	3604860	Caesar Augustus, Julius' nephew.
3604860	3611140	And so with Augustus' victory, Julius Caesar is literally deified, recognized as a literal
3611140	3617100	god by the Roman Senate, and becomes a fountainhead of Roman legitimacy and prestige.
3617100	3623380	From then on, rulers derive their legitimacy from their relationship to Caesar, often explicitly,
3623380	3626060	by bearing their name, calling themselves Caesars.
3626060	3630300	That's why there are so many Caesars in the history of leaders.
3630300	3635380	The victim-turned-god, captured through myth for Gerard, is what lies at the heart of pagan
3635380	3637260	religion and society.
3637260	3641140	But of course, we need much more than stories to run a society and keep the peace.
3641140	3647300	So out of these myths and founding murders, two sets of real institutions were derived,
3647300	3649340	prohibitions and rituals.
3649340	3653500	The logic of prohibitions is to prevent chaos from erupting by creating social difference
3653500	3657980	between people so that metaphysical desire does not spread as easily.
3657980	3662980	Caste systems, gender roles, guild lineages, however oppressive, these served a crucial
3662980	3667300	function in pagan society to keep people from competing with each other.
3667300	3672660	Now, when prohibitions failed, another set of institutions must be used, and these are
3672660	3673660	rituals.
3673660	3678460	Rituals aim to enact the founding murder in a constrained way to generate a dissimilar
3678460	3682140	level of catharsis as the founding murder did.
3682140	3687420	Ritual incests, debauchers festivals, human sacrifice, however cruel, these institutions
3687420	3692220	also served a crucial function in pagan society to generate catharsis in order to keep the
3692220	3693220	peace.
3693220	3695900	They are a release valve.
3695900	3701780	To summarize then, the scapegoat mechanism proceeds from a real cataclysmic event where
3701780	3707300	a troubled society murders an innocent victim, gains cathartic release, and receives a set
3707300	3708940	of new gods.
3708940	3714260	This real event is dramatized and captured in myth and then translated back into real
3714260	3717820	institutions in the form of prohibitions and rituals.
3717820	3723980	This arc, going from real event to myth to real institutions, is not only how pagan gods
3723980	3729660	and religions have been made, but also how all human societies and cultures are founded.
3729660	3735700	Now, of course, these societies and myths are based on lies through and through, both
3735740	3741180	the scapegoating and the deification are equally deceitful, because the victim neither has
3741180	3744300	the power to cause or end the chaos.
3744300	3749540	It's all psychological projection by the crowd, grounded on nothing but unanimity.
3749540	3754780	And importantly, this deceitfulness is always occluded by myth, because myth is written
3754780	3757580	from the perspective of the persecutor.
3757580	3763060	The persecutor writes from a position of the crowd, and from that vantage point, all will
3763100	3764180	seem real.
3764180	3770580	The blame, the praise, the deification are all deserved and not mere projections.
3770580	3775900	But more importantly, none of this could be revealed, because if they were, then gods
3775900	3780580	would lose their powers if people realized that it was they themselves who through unanimity
3780580	3782580	projected the power onto them.
3782580	3785900	It's all deceitful and all arbitrary.
3785900	3791060	This explanation of pagan religion by Gerard then begs an important question.
3791060	3793220	Why is Gerard a Christian?
3793220	3798580	Primafeisha, Christianity perfectly conforms to this logic that he attributed to false
3798580	3800620	pagan religions, right?
3800620	3805060	There's civil unrest in Jerusalem, where Christ eventually gets crucified.
3805060	3808780	There's obviously Christ's unjust scapegoating and murder on the cross.
3808780	3811420	There's the resurrection and divinization.
3811420	3814340	There's the mythologization through the Bible.
3814340	3818500	And then there's the institutionalization through the Catholic Church and many of its
3818500	3820140	prohibitions and rituals.
3820140	3825220	The question is this, how can the Christian story be true for Gerard, but the pagan religions
3825220	3827420	be false?
3827420	3831860	Gerard's answer is that the Christian story is indeed going to have the same structure
3831860	3835500	as pagan religion, because Christ is going to be scapegoated.
3835500	3838060	But there's one crucial difference.
3838060	3844860	Christianity will be the first story told from the perspective of the victim.
3844860	3848180	Remember, pagan myth always sides with the murderers.
3848180	3850820	It always believes in the guilt of its victims.
3850820	3855660	Sophocles' telling of Oedipus affirms the judgment of Thebes that Oedipus was indeed
3855660	3859460	responsible for the plague because of his patricide and incest.
3859460	3865140	Or take the founding murder of the Roman Republic, that of Romulus and Remus, where Romulus kills
3865140	3866820	Remus to establish Rome.
3866820	3873340	The canonical telling here, again, paints the killing as, however regrettable, as justified
3873340	3880060	by Remus' hubris and transgression from ignoring Romulus' city's boundaries.
3880060	3885300	What the Bible is doing, then, is to tell the same type of story as pagan religion,
3885300	3887580	but from the other perspective.
3887580	3892580	Not the perspective of the persecutor, which all pagan religion has been told from, but
3892580	3893580	the victim.
3893580	3896340	I mean, think about it, what does the Bible tell us?
3896340	3901580	He tells us that Christ is not guilty, even his sentencer, Pontius Pilate, declares his
3901580	3902580	innocence.
3902580	3907060	A mob that convicts Christ is shown to be arbitrary, the true source of evil.
3907060	3911860	The sentencing of Christ is depicted as unjust through and through, with the charges against
3911860	3915860	Christ nothing more than psychological projections by the crowd.
3915860	3917700	This is what that story tells us.
3917700	3923140	And of course, the whole story is written down and told to us by the disciples, the
3923140	3926380	side of the victim and not the persecutor.
3926380	3931340	Christianity tells the story of scapegoating, but from the opposite, truthful side.
3931700	3937180	We are like jurors who have been hearing the criminals' lies for so long in pagan religion,
3937180	3941460	suddenly exposed to the truth of the victim's testimony.
3941460	3944700	The crucifixion exposes the lies of all religions.
3944700	3950940	To show that, the mob is deceitful, the victim is innocent, there is no sacred pagan power
3950940	3952700	that is merely projection.
3952700	3959180	This is the fundamental, resounding message that comes out of the crucifixion for Gerard.
3959180	3965380	And it is a message that will expose and begin to tear down the scapegoat mechanism, slowly
3965380	3966820	but surely.
3966820	3971700	From this moment on, we will be reading myths in the light of the Gospels, which allows
3971700	3974420	us to see through their lies.
3974420	3979700	Christ's innocence and unjust persecution through the proliferation of Christianity becomes
3979700	3983540	the dominant lens through which we will view the world from then on.
3983540	3986420	We will always be looking out for unjust persecution.
3986420	3988820	We will always be siding with the victim.
3988820	3992100	We will always be aware of the deceitfulness of the mob.
3992100	3997300	Christ knows that reason alone that an analytical articulation of the scapegoat mechanism like
3997300	4003140	the one I just provided you is not enough to shake societies out of this perennial cultural
4003140	4004140	practice.
4004140	4010060	What we need is an equally compelling story that shakes us into a radically new mode of
4010060	4012460	seeing the world.
4012460	4017660	To your point, I'm always surprised by how much of our secular world is grounded on
4017660	4018980	Christian concepts.
4018980	4024660	I think of the Protestant work ethic, our concern for victims, human rights, you know?
4024660	4025660	Yeah.
4025660	4028380	And this is how powerful the Christian story is.
4028380	4033860	We are all, in a sense, living in a Christian paradigm, even if we're not explicitly Christians,
4033860	4040660	because Christianity grounds the fundamental philosophical intuitions of modernity.
4040660	4045340	Christianity then for Gerard is the religion to end all religions, the myth to end all
4045420	4052180	myths, the founding murder to end all founding murders by exposing their violent, unjust,
4052180	4054020	and deceitful origins.
4054020	4058660	The right metaphor to think about Christianity and pagan religion then is the relationship
4058660	4061580	between a vaccine and the original disease.
4061580	4066780	The efficacy of a vaccine to neutralize the original disease lies in its proximity, not
4066780	4068460	its radical difference, right?
4068460	4072580	The structurally, the COVID vaccine is very similar to the original COVID disease, just
4072620	4077540	with a few tweaks, and it's that similarity is what makes it an effective COVID vaccine
4077540	4080980	and not like a polio vaccine, for example.
4080980	4084780	The Bible then for Gerard is a myth vaccine.
4084780	4089860	And so the strategy of many modern Christians to show that the Bible has nothing to do with
4089860	4093340	the myths of your, that it is radically different, is misguided.
4093340	4098740	I mean, take the epic of Gilgamesh, one of the first known myths of Mesopotamia.
4098740	4103660	Modern Christians blush at the similarities between this myth and the Bible, right?
4103660	4108100	There's a quest for a fruit of immortality from the tree of eternal life.
4108100	4112940	These are things that both exist in the Bible as well as the myth of Gilgamesh.
4112940	4117540	There's a deceitful snake eating a fruit and robbing us of our immortality.
4117540	4121980	And there's also great floods from which the chosen are protected.
4121980	4127100	Gerard would say, look, don't blush and don't try to distance the Bible from these myths.
4127100	4132980	The Bible is effective because and not despite of its proximity to myths.
4132980	4137940	The Bible is a Trojan horse that frees us from pagan religion from within.
4137940	4146060	Gerard's surprising conclusion is that Christianity is a demystifying force here to end all religions.
4146060	4152020	The Christian moral paradigm takes away the core foundational bedrock of all early human
4152020	4153020	societies.
4153020	4159020	Slowly but surely, Christianity allows us to decode and escape from the scapegoat mechanism,
4159020	4161780	which cannot function if people know that the victim is innocent.
4161780	4165740	If the victim is shown to be innocent, then catharsis cannot be achieved.
4165740	4167420	Without catharsis, there's no peace.
4167420	4169380	Without peace, there's no deification.
4169380	4174380	Without deification, pagan worldly institutions lose their prestige and without prestige,
4174380	4177460	they can no longer properly function.
4177460	4182940	Christianity takes humanity out of cyclical time, demarcated by these relativistic moral
4182940	4188020	paradigm shifts and accelerates us towards a linear trajectory.
4188020	4195340	Now the direction of this linearity is defined by four key forces that Christ lets loose
4195340	4196860	on human history.
4196860	4203900	Love, truth, innovation, and surprisingly, Gerard thinks violence.
4203900	4208500	As with all things Gerard, even his analysis on the worldly effects of Christianity are
4208500	4210420	deeply ambivalent.
4210420	4215300	Within this Pandora's box of forces that Christ has just let loose on human history,
4215300	4221380	we have the good, love, truth, innovation, but also the apocalyptic violence.
4221380	4225980	They are both growing and have broken free all at the same time.
4225980	4233420	What's more, even within these individual forces, Gerard's analysis is deeply ambivalent.
4233420	4236780	Love often manifests as hypocrisy.
4236780	4242300	Truth becomes dogma, and innovation degenerates into fashion.
4242300	4249100	And even in violence, Gerard sees a key motivational force that has brought forth the most enviable
4249100	4253460	living conditions of man when channeled productively through capitalism.
4253460	4256580	Let's examine each of these forces in turn.
4256580	4261300	The first force that Christianity unleashes on history is love.
4261300	4265460	Love is the force that has made all of our institutions like law so much more humane.
4265460	4271580	It's the force that sees developed nations competing for the prestige of helping troubled
4271580	4272580	nations.
4272580	4277500	It's the force that has freed us from cruel practices of human sacrifice and bloody rituals.
4277500	4283100	It's the force underpinning the modern political ideals of human rights and equality.
4283100	4288060	Gerard believes that Christ is responsible for all of this because that was his key message.
4288060	4294140	Renounce violence, turn the other cheek, develop love, love thy neighbor as thyself.
4294140	4299140	We are so concerned with the poor and the dispossessed these days, we naturally side
4299140	4304620	with victims in the same way that pagan societies might have sided with the strong because Christ's
4304620	4309460	story is about the innocence and the moral purity of victims.
4309460	4314060	Culturally, we are radically different from pagan society with their worship of power
4314060	4321180	and disregard for the weak, but in some sense, stubborn human nature still refuses to budge.
4321180	4325660	Gerard thinks we still need to persecute, but the only acceptable way to persecute is
4325660	4330540	now in the name of victims, in the name of stopping persecution.
4330540	4334540	In a way then, Gerard isn't convinced society has really changed that much at all that we've
4334540	4336780	really given up persecution.
4336780	4342040	Rather, perhaps the better reading is that it's a mere superficial switch of who we
4342040	4345300	think it's acceptable to persecute.
4345300	4349860	Because of our victim-concerned culture, anyone who looks like a traditional victim is completely
4349860	4354620	off limits, ethnic minorities, the lower classes, women, the disabled, and Gerard thinks that's
4354620	4356100	a great thing.
4356100	4359100	But the problem is that we've flipped it on its head.
4359100	4364620	Now we feel warranted, nay, maybe even compelled to persecute all types of privilege, white
4364620	4369060	privilege, ableist privilege, class privilege, male privilege.
4369060	4375400	Gerard has this to say, I'll give you a quote, our society's obligatory compassion authorizes
4375400	4378980	new forms of cruelty.
4378980	4384700	Gerard accuses modernity of hypocrisy, and he reminds us of the terrible atrocities
4384700	4387540	committed in the name of protecting victims.
4387540	4390220	Let me give you another quote.
4390220	4393840	Hypocrisy is dangerous then because it leads to what it claims to prevent, the persecution
4393840	4395340	of victims.
4395340	4399180	Anyone familiar with the tragedies of the Soviet Union grounded on protection of the
4399180	4406020	victimized proletariat should look at America's caught up in victimhood ideology with trembling
4406020	4407020	fear.
4407020	4408880	This is other totalitarianism.
4408880	4413740	This inquisition in the name of victims is the form that arbitrary unjustified violence
4413740	4417860	takes place today, the persecution of persecutors.
4417860	4418860	End quote.
4418860	4421140	Now, that's love.
4421140	4428460	And the same ambivalent story could be told for the second force of Christianity, truth.
4428460	4434460	Gerard asks us to look around in the modern world, more so than any almost other civilization.
4434460	4438900	We value truth and believe in our ability to obtain it.
4438900	4443700	Far are we from the garden of Eden's prohibitions against the tree of knowledge.
4443700	4446980	Far are we from the intellectual humilities of Job.
4446980	4451020	Far are we from the lessons from Oedipus that knowing more can lead to disaster.
4451020	4454660	And far are we from witch hunts and superstitions.
4454660	4460900	Perhaps unsurprisingly at this point, Gerard takes the crowning achievement of truth, science,
4460900	4463580	to be engendered by Christianity.
4463580	4468140	This might seem ridiculous, but let me give you a first pass at his argument.
4468140	4473140	Christianity paved the way for scientific inquiry by expelling myth and clearing the
4473140	4475100	ground as it were.
4475100	4478260	This should already be a familiar idea at this point.
4478260	4484540	Christianity exposes the deceitfulness of worldly foundations and begins to tear down prohibitions,
4484540	4486740	rituals, and all pagan religions.
4486740	4492500	And it's only when we cease to look for truth in myth does reason even have the fertile
4492500	4496420	ground to bear the fruits of truth.
4496420	4500820	After all, if something is already explained by a wildly prestigious myth that is fatal
4500820	4505020	to question, then reason will not even want to begin to investigate it.
4505020	4508860	Gerard's interlocutor sums up his view quite nicely here.
4508860	4509860	Let me quote again.
4509860	4516300	It is really Christianity that makes science possible by desacralizing the real, by freeing
4516300	4519180	people from magical causalities.
4519180	4524340	Once we stop seeing storms as being triggered by the machinations of the witch across the
4524340	4530540	street, we start being able to study meteorological phenomenon scientifically.
4530540	4535620	Now, I need to say a lot more and I will to convince you of this point, but before we
4535620	4540780	celebrate too early, the same problem with love occurs with truth.
4540780	4546060	Just as the protection of victims is the banner which persecutors rally under, we love science
4546060	4551660	so much that we have fetishized it into an unquestionable religion.
4551660	4556780	But what's the problem with science gaining an immense prestige?
4556780	4558620	What's wrong with that?
4558620	4560340	Gerard's answer is this.
4560340	4567620	By being deified, science can become unquestionable, which can silence opposing voices and justify
4567620	4569700	terrible political agendas.
4569700	4572300	Think about Malthus in the 18th century.
4572300	4576540	The reason that living standards will go back to subsistence is because population growth
4576540	4581140	grows geometrically while food increases arithmetically.
4581140	4587300	In the 1970s, there was a whole wave of ridiculous climate science championed by the Times, the
4587300	4589980	New York Review, Columbia Brown.
4589980	4594860	They were publishing articles about an inevitable ice age that just seems ludicrous from today's
4594860	4595860	perspective.
4595860	4601540	And of course, the terrors of the Nazis were justified on the latest science of the day,
4601780	4602940	eugenics.
4602940	4608620	Far from a pseudoscience, eugenics enjoyed enormous prestige in the early 20th century.
4608620	4614220	It was grounded on Darwin, the latest evolutionary biology of the day, and responsible for the
4614220	4616460	development of statistics.
4616460	4621460	There was a University College London chair of eugenics in the same way there might be
4621460	4623580	a chair for biology today.
4623580	4628020	And eugenics was supported by Nobel laureates like Hermann Mueller and political leaders
4628020	4630100	like Theodore Roosevelt.
4630100	4634020	So I hope the problem of deifying science is clear.
4634020	4638260	George thinks the reason that it is dangerous to deify science is the same reason it was
4638260	4641820	dangerous to deify edicts of the Catholic Church.
4641820	4647860	Just as the bloody European conquest of the Americas was, at least partially, legitimized
4647860	4653620	through the appeal to Catholicism as spreading the gospel, today we too legitimize our often
4653700	4660260	questionable political pursuits with just a sprinkle of reason, a little dab of science.
4660260	4664660	And just as whomever used to disagree with the Catholic Church, we called heretics.
4664660	4670900	We call those today who disagree with politically-charged, questionable science as anti-science, someone
4670900	4674620	whose positions we don't even have to contend with.
4674620	4680780	When deified, science becomes a blocker to truth and genuine inquiry, because it becomes
4680780	4682780	a conversation stopper.
4682780	4685660	Therein lies the hypocrisy.
4685660	4691540	Now, the third force of Christianity is innovation, and it has been engendered by Christ in a
4691540	4694500	very similar way that science was.
4694500	4700380	By tearing down myths, we are freed from an exaggerated adulation of the past, and we
4700380	4704740	are enabled and empowered to imagine its future.
4704740	4709180	The idea that Gerard has in mind here might be better approximated by thinking about the
4709180	4710420	negative case.
4710420	4715740	What is certainly not conducive to innovation is the reactionary idea, not uncommon throughout
4715740	4721100	most history, most famously perhaps among the Confucians and perhaps many Christians
4721100	4724020	that our best days are behind us.
4724020	4730340	And such a view lends to the practical orientation that the best we can do is to blindly imitate
4730340	4735340	the past and press the brakes on the downward trajectory of history.
4735340	4741180	Under such a worldview, the very word innovation had negative connotations in the West, up
4741180	4743260	until the 18th century.
4743260	4749100	Its connotations were negative because innovation implied a deviation from a sacred, albeit static
4749100	4753500	and rigid ideal, provided to us by the myths of yore.
4753500	4757420	Innovation before the 18th century was synonymous with heresy.
4757420	4763060	Now, such an exaggerated respect of the past is often grounded on a religious belief in
4763100	4765060	a mythologized past.
4765060	4770140	Christianity frees us from this blind worship because it is a force, according to Gerard,
4770140	4774460	of course, that tears down mythologization.
4774460	4779380	It reveals to us what we once thought of as immutable, as arbitrary, so we are free to
4779380	4781740	experiment and innovate.
4781740	4788660	One of the surprising things that I've seen is this weird anti-correlation between mythologizing
4788660	4790740	the past and innovation.
4790860	4795020	I started to get this hunch when I would spend time around Silicon Valley types and
4795020	4799820	you have dinner with them and they boast about their knowledge of the world.
4799820	4804220	But then you start talking to them about the history of their own industry and it's not
4804220	4807940	something that they think or talk about a lot.
4807940	4812180	I compare that to the people I've met in the oil industry or the finance industry, these
4812180	4816620	older and more established industries, where the people who I meet there, they know the
4816620	4819020	history of their industries cold.
4819020	4820020	You know what I mean?
4820300	4824860	That's a very interesting observation that there is a negative correlation between how
4824860	4830380	innovative an industry or a person is against how much they know about history or at least
4830380	4831860	seem to respect it.
4831860	4836620	I think Gerard would say that the difference between the tech industry and the oil industry
4836620	4843340	is the same difference between modernity and pagan society, that we are much less idolatrous
4843340	4847940	and concerned with the past and as a result much more oriented towards the future due
4847940	4849940	to Christianity.
4849940	4856300	Now, as we are freed from the grips of the past, innovation has brought about drastic
4856300	4857860	technological and social change.
4857860	4861620	Clearly, if you just look around our world, there's the mastery of travel and land, air
4861620	4862620	and sea.
4862620	4867420	There's the victory over disease and starvation, the political systems, gender norms, money,
4867420	4873580	Western civilization, at least in the past few hundred years, is defined by and prides
4873580	4875380	itself with change.
4875380	4880580	The problem with innovation is the same problem with love and truth, hypocrisy.
4880580	4882860	We've now fetishized innovation.
4882860	4885160	We are conforming to contrarianism.
4885160	4889140	We are obediently rallying under the banner of originality.
4889140	4893060	Gerard has this to say, it's so good that I'll quote it in full.
4893060	4897780	The modern world rejects imitation in favor of originality at all costs.
4897780	4900740	You should never say what others are saying, never paint what others are painting, never
4900740	4903300	think what others are thinking and so on.
4903300	4910140	Since this is absolutely impossible, there soon emerges a negative imitation that sterilizes
4910140	4911140	everything.
4911140	4917100	More and more, often they're obliged to turn their coats inside out and with great fanfare
4917100	4922780	announce some new epistemological rupture that is supposed to revolutionize the field
4922780	4924460	from top to bottom.
4924460	4929780	This rage for originality has produced a few rare masterpieces and quite a few rather
4929780	4931100	bizarre things.
4931100	4935380	The principle of originality at all costs leads to paralysis.
4935380	4941500	The more we celebrate creative and enriching innovations, the fewer of them there are.
4941500	4947100	For 2,000 years, the arts have been imitative and it's only in the 19th and 20th century
4947100	4949980	that people started refusing to be mimetic.
4949980	4951220	Why?
4951220	4953660	Because we're more mimetic than ever.
4953660	4960580	Rivalry plays a role such that we strive vainly to exercise imitation.
4960580	4965700	The problem that Gerard is identifying here, with categorically rejecting imitation and
4965700	4972420	idolizing innovation, is that imitation and meaningful innovation are often inseparable.
4972420	4977560	You need to imitate and gain mastery first before you can make any real innovations.
4977560	4983620	History is littered with examples where repetition, replication, imitation is a necessary precondition
4983620	4984740	for innovation.
4984740	4990220	Think about Goethe, who was a master of reproduction, reproducing the great poetic forms before
4990220	4991660	he pioneered his own.
4991660	4997100	Think about the industrial powers that started off as mere copycats but grew into innovators
4997100	4998540	in their own right.
4998540	5001060	Let me read Gerard again.
5001060	5005860	It began with Germany, which, in the 19th century, was thought to be at most capable
5005860	5008000	of imitating English.
5008000	5011100	And this, at the precise moment, surpassed them.
5011100	5015500	It continued with the Americans in whom, for a long time, the Europeans saw mediocre
5015500	5020660	gadget makers, who weren't theoretical or cerebral enough to take on a world leadership
5020660	5021660	role.
5021660	5026140	And it happened once more with the Japanese, who, after World War II, were still seen as
5026140	5029740	pathetic imitators of Western superiority.
5029740	5031940	It's starting up again, it seems, with Korea.
5031940	5034580	And soon, perhaps, it'll be the Chinese.
5034580	5039260	All of these consecutive mistakes about the creative potential of imitation cannot be
5039260	5040260	due to chance.
5040260	5041260	End quote.
5042140	5047380	Gerard's point here is that by fetishizing contrarianism, innovation, originality, and
5047380	5054620	by rejecting repetition, replication, imitation, we paradoxically doom ourselves to never make
5054620	5060820	any meaningful innovations whatsoever, because innovation is dependent on imitation.
5060820	5069180	Now, as you can see, even the three quote-unquote good forces of modernity are deeply ambivalent.
5069180	5070180	Nature's fundamentally changed.
5070180	5074420	There's never been a society as loving, truthful, and innovative as ours.
5074420	5077380	But stubborn human nature refuses to budge.
5077380	5081300	We still need to persecute, to deify, and to conform.
5081300	5087380	And so, the perversities of modernity for Gerard all take on the shape of hypocrisy,
5087380	5091980	persecution under the banner of protecting victims, rigid adherence to scientific dogmas
5091980	5098140	under the guise of free intellectual exploration, the most derivative of imitations packaged
5098140	5100580	as radical innovations.
5100580	5106340	The metaphor, then, that best captures this radical break as well as stubborn continuity
5106340	5110500	is a just-launch rocket struggling to reach escape velocity.
5110500	5112100	I mean, think about it.
5112100	5116980	Such a rocket is clearly a radical break from it was stationary.
5116980	5122260	But it is also in a continuity, because it is still governed by the pull of gravity.
5122260	5127260	The same, perhaps, can be said for the point of history that we're in now.
5127260	5131980	There's a clear radical break between our culture that protects victims and all the
5131980	5135500	ones that have come before, which made them into scapegoats.
5135500	5140260	But the stubborn gravitational pull of the human condition remains the same.
5140260	5144260	We still need to persecute and find victims to blame.
5144260	5150220	It's this tension between cultural advancement and the constancy of human nature that plagues
5150220	5152260	modernity for Gerard.
5152260	5158020	Now, our rocket ship of modernity is already in trouble, but the fourth and final force
5158020	5163100	of Christianity will send it crashing towards the ground‚Äîviolence.
5163100	5167780	You may be surprised that Gerard conceived of violence as one of the forces coming out
5167780	5170860	of Christ's defeating the scapegoat mechanism.
5170860	5175340	But given Gerard's understanding of how worldly peace is brought about, this conclusion
5175340	5178700	in some sense should flow quite naturally.
5178700	5183340	After all, if worldly order, a peaceful society, is founded on a deceitful, violent act of
5183340	5189300	catharsis, then truth and love, which Christianity has unleashed, must be threatening if not
5189300	5191620	harmful for this foundation.
5191620	5196300	The scapegoat mechanism is a deeply morally ambivalent process for Gerard.
5196300	5201460	It is deceitful, it is wrong, but it's also so damn effective.
5201460	5206780	Just a single, innocent man has to be murdered for the entire community to be saved.
5206780	5210900	Christ's one, for the peace of all, limits the freedom of the parts for the stability
5210900	5212300	of the whole.
5212300	5217460	And so, we might say, in a highly reductive fashion, that the scapegoat mechanism is a
5217460	5223540	worldly good, but ultimate evil, whereas Christ is ultimately good, but brings forth worldly
5223540	5224540	destruction.
5224540	5231380	Gerard constantly reminds us that Christ himself says as much, Matthew 10.34, Christ
5231380	5233380	has this to say.
5233380	5241500	If not that I am come to send peace on earth, I came not to send peace, but a sword.
5241500	5246740	Christ's sword is aimed at the scapegoat mechanism, which lies at the foundation of
5246740	5247940	worldly order.
5247940	5253940	Now, while the consequences of the Christian revelation for Gerard are violent and destructive,
5253940	5256540	Christ's intentions surely are not.
5256540	5260580	Christ did not cut down the worldly order for the sake of cutting down worldly order,
5260580	5266860	but only so we may be freed from violence and lies, such that we can love each other.
5266860	5272540	Christ took off our training wheels so that we may be freed, yet we've simply fallen
5272540	5274660	and stumbled.
5274660	5279700	Without the scapegoat mechanism, we no longer have our old prohibitions to stop metaphysical
5279700	5285140	desires from running rampant, nor do we have sacrificial rituals to bring about catharsis.
5285140	5290700	So to put it in other words, we've lost both our tools to prevent and resolve violence.
5290700	5293020	So why haven't we gone bust yet?
5293020	5297180	After all, the world looks pretty peaceful to me.
5297180	5303380	Gerard responds, don't confuse the lack of the actuality of violence with the lack of
5303380	5305740	the potential for violence.
5305740	5310180	Violent energies have been building up and increasing, but they've been contained and
5310180	5316460	productively channeled for now, by two new institutions of modernity.
5316460	5318820	The first institution is capitalism.
5318820	5323060	Capitalism is the channel that absorbs and productively directs violence.
5323060	5327380	Let me be clear that when Gerard says that capitalism is a channel for violence, he
5327380	5333620	doesn't have in mind whipping slaves to build the pyramids, but that the same violent, competitive
5333620	5339380	energies of glory, of pride, of desire for conquest are the dominant ones driving capitalism
5340140	5340620	today.
5340620	5347220	Gerard reminds us, I quote, it is not by chance that the European aristocracy went into business
5347220	5351140	once heroes and warriors went out of style, end quote.
5351140	5356700	Gerard's point is that when we peek behind the motivational curtains of actors and capitalism,
5356700	5359500	we shouldn't expect to find a desire to help others.
5359500	5363980	We shouldn't even expect to find a materialistic greed, instead what people are really after
5363980	5368940	are the same social goods, recognition, honor, prestige, glory.
5368940	5374100	The princes and heroes of yore who would have amassed armies now find themselves competing
5374100	5376700	to make products and services.
5376700	5382420	Gerard warns us such, don't be fooled by the altruistic aims that capitalistic actors
5382420	5384380	so desperately advertise.
5384380	5388580	It's the same drive that drove Achilles to kill Hector, that drove Germany to invade
5388580	5395180	France, that drove Caesar to capture Vercingetorix, that underpins our world economy today.
5395180	5400300	It's funny, you're referencing ancient stories there, but even today, I'll look at my friends
5400300	5406420	who are successful entrepreneurs and a shocking percentage of them were criminals in high school.
5406420	5406940	Right.
5406940	5414420	And I think that the same energy that drove them to be criminals, what capitalism does,
5414420	5418380	is it redirects that energy towards entrepreneurship.
5418380	5424100	Yeah, and I think this is both a deep critique of capital, right, that it's fundamentally
5424100	5430940	driven off these spirited irrational forces, but also a depraise of capitalism, right?
5430940	5435980	What a miracle it is today that people who seek revenge, who seek glory, who seek domination,
5435980	5442100	who seek an outlet for their criminal energies have to do so, not by killing millions in
5442100	5448180	zero-sum wars as people have done for thousands of years, but they have to compete in making
5448180	5451060	better in products and services for others.
5451060	5455940	What a miracle Gerard's analysis on capitalism is deeply ambivalent.
5455940	5460700	Now, capitalism can only properly function in this way.
5460700	5466700	When it is supported by law, law is the second important institution of modernity that contains
5466700	5468140	violence.
5468140	5474740	For Gerard, law only works in situations where there's an entity with a monopoly over violence
5474740	5477980	that can arbitrate between disputing parties.
5477980	5484020	Law does not bring about peace through catharsis, nor the edicts of law justified on the prestige
5484020	5485340	of some deity.
5485340	5489940	It keeps peace by threatening with you with more violence.
5489940	5496360	If you, the injured party, aren't satisfied with the outcome of a trial and seek private
5496360	5501480	vengeance by killing or hurting the criminal who injured you, then the state will come
5501480	5504460	after you and punish you with more violence.
5504460	5509700	Law only functions when there is such a powerful entity with a monopoly over violence that
5509700	5512980	can easily overpower disputing parties.
5512980	5516140	That's where its efficacy stems from.
5516140	5522680	This is why within a single nation, laws are often inviolable and sacrosanct, yet between
5522680	5524180	nations, right?
5524180	5528340	Think the laws of the UN or the Geneva Convention.
5528340	5534740	These laws without an entity, without a monopoly over violence, are so often transgressed with
5534740	5536780	little consequence.
5536780	5542200	For Gerard, capitalism is this bubbling stew of violent competitive energies that must
5542200	5547180	be contained by law if that violence is not to overflow.
5547180	5553800	That is why Gerard thinks the dyke will break where capitalism intersects the weakest points
5553800	5558440	of law in between nations, in global trade.
5558440	5563360	Global trade is where national pride and competitive energies are piled up, yet there
5563360	5570280	is no monopolistic force of violence to arbitrate law between parties.
5570280	5575900	Under this light, let me read you Gerard's startling predictions 15 years ago once more.
5575900	5581360	He said this again at the height of Sino-American optimism, when popular wisdom all believed
5581440	5585480	that relationships between China and the U.S. would only get better through trade.
5585480	5587320	I quote to you again,
5587320	5591160	A conflict between the United States and China will follow.
5591160	5592800	Everything is in place.
5592800	5598660	Though it will not necessarily occur on the military level at first, trade can transform
5598660	5600720	very quickly into war.
5600720	5605880	From this point of view, we can reasonably fear a major clash between China and the United
5605880	5608320	States in the coming decades.
5608760	5612600	If such a war between colossal nation states were to actually happen, it could very well
5612600	5614600	be the last war.
5614600	5619360	With the invention of nuclear weaponry, Gerard thinks we genuinely do live in an apocalyptic
5619360	5624200	moment where the entire world can go up in flames in mere minutes.
5624200	5628120	What is unique about the nuke isn't its singular destructive force.
5628120	5632680	The firebombing of Tokyo, the Mongol mass murders, I think are all comparable to the
5632680	5636080	devastation of a singular nuclear strike.
5636080	5641640	What is unique about the nuke is that it forces rivals to utterly destroy each other at the
5641640	5644160	first glimpse of provocation.
5644160	5649000	Unlike firebombing or a Mongol horde that takes time to maneuver through terrain, there
5649000	5653160	are no frictions to unleashing your entire nuclear arsenal.
5653160	5658880	Before the nuke, nations fought wars like a boxing match, taking time to maneuver, resting
5658880	5663880	in between with fatal blows rare and after taking a very long time.
5663880	5671440	The nuke allows nation states to fight wars like a duel, an instant and fatal escalation.
5671440	5676000	In many ways, it's worse than a duel because it allows the dead party to shoot the person
5676000	5677480	who is alive.
5677480	5682720	Even if you nuke my entire landmass into oblivion, my nuclear submarines can still avenge me
5682720	5684280	post-mortem.
5684280	5688920	This is what it means by mutually assured destruction.
5688920	5697280	Armed in this light, Drard's worries of apocalypse is less theological speculation than deja vu.
5697280	5705440	On October 27, 1962, a Soviet submarine armed with a nuclear-tipped torpedo was located and
5705440	5712200	targeted by an American carrier group, dropping a signaling-depth charge like underwater bombs
5712200	5717520	intended to destroy the submarine at the height of the Cuban missile crisis.
5717520	5722320	The crew in that submarine had completely lost contact with Moscow for days and thought
5722320	5724760	that a new world war had broken out.
5724760	5728840	They were debating and considering whether to fire the nuke, believing that they were
5728840	5730960	under direct attack.
5730960	5737440	This submarine required all three senior officers to agree to launch the strike.
5737440	5740520	Two of them decided to do so.
5740520	5747120	Only one officer's stubborn refusal prevented an almost certain nuclear attack and likely
5747120	5748560	Armageddon.
5748560	5750400	This is how close we were.
5750400	5754600	The will of one man was all that stood in the way.
5754600	5759960	With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the specter of apocalypse has long faded from
5759960	5766720	the public imagination, but Drard prophesies that this ghost of yours will soon return
5766720	5769040	to haunt us once more.
5769040	5774160	If the end of the world had a beginning, I think we could do far worse than attributing
5774160	5777080	it to the invention of the nuclear bomb.
5777080	5780640	So how ought one live in the end times?
5780640	5783920	With apocalypse around the corner, what ought one do?
5783920	5787920	Drard's answer is brief as it is unsatisfying.
5787920	5788920	Withdraw.
5788920	5790400	Withdraw from the world.
5790400	5791640	Leave it all behind.
5791640	5792880	Tend to your own garden.
5792880	5795080	There's nothing you can do to stop apocalypse.
5795080	5798440	You're only going to muddy your own moral character by trying to get involved in such
5798440	5799440	a mess.
5799440	5800440	Withdraw.
5800440	5803920	Stay away from it all so that you can nurture your soul.
5803920	5809200	The kingdom of God will not be established here on earth, but perhaps we can preserve
5809200	5813080	ourselves to be worthy of it in heaven.
5813080	5819560	On November 4th, 2015, Drard passed away peacefully in his home in Stanford, California
5819560	5826960	at the age of 91, leaving us in deafening silence, stranded in an apocalyptic moment
5826960	5830200	with nothing but the advice to withdraw.
5830200	5836020	This is how Drard's story ends and where our lectures will also come to a screeching
5836020	5837520	halt.
5837520	5842640	Hopefully, I've given enough reason already to engage with Drard and continue with these
5842640	5843640	lecture series.
5843640	5848440	I fear that as time progresses, Drard will prove to be if you'll entertain another
5848440	5854120	metaphor, a seismograph of history, able to feel the slight tremors that would balloon
5854120	5859880	to tectonic shifts before others even know that we are standing on a fault line.
5859880	5863240	Drard begins his final work as such.
5863240	5865840	This is an apocalyptic book.
5865840	5871840	It will become more understandable with time because, unquestionably, we are accelerating
5871840	5876360	swiftly towards the destruction of the world."
5876360	5882360	Unfortunately, his most unlikely prediction of worsening Sino-American relationships has
5882360	5886280	already been made more understandable with time.
5886280	5891680	On the topic of apocalypse, I desperately hope Drard is wrong, but I fear that he is
5891680	5893160	right.
5893160	5897680	If he is right, then Drard is worth engaging because he is one of the only guys to help
5897680	5903920	us navigate the end time, one of the few Virgil's left who still take apocalypse literally
5903920	5905560	and seriously.
5905560	5911200	However, I would be a deceitful merchant of ideas if I also didn't share with you why
5911200	5915400	you shouldn't engage with Drard or continue with these lectures.
5915440	5918040	There's a common metaphor given about philosophy.
5918040	5922200	Philosophy is often compared with medicine, that it has the power to cure our souls and
5922200	5927600	societies and I think that's a quite apt metaphor, but just not taken far enough.
5927600	5931280	Because just as medicine has side effects, so do philosophies.
5931280	5936200	And I wish that philosophers wrote on the side of their books the unwanted side effects
5936200	5940320	of their philosophies as pharmaceutical companies did it on their drugs.
5940320	5945000	Warning, disdain for the material world if you take too much of these platonic dialogues
5945000	5946320	in one sitting.
5946320	5951160	Caution, more than one dose of Nietzsche a day makes patients with pre-existing health
5951160	5954320	conditions descend into uncontrollable rage.
5954320	5958760	Side effect, erectile dysfunction if you take these Buddhist sutras too seriously.
5958760	5965280	Attention, inability to form coherent sentences if you read too much Adorno in one sitting.
5965280	5970280	Just as a drug will course through your veins and infiltrate your entire system.
5970280	5975440	Drard's ideas will latch themselves onto your psyche and colonize your world view.
5975440	5980640	So we must ask, what are the side effects of engaging Drard?
5980640	5986320	I've presented to you the red pill, but as any honest merchant I must also tell you why
5986320	5988920	you should take the blue pill instead.
5988920	5993520	The likely but not necessary side effects of Drard are threefold.
5993520	5995720	First, alienation.
5995720	6001360	Drard will likely show your most intimate long-held desires, ones that your entire identity
6001360	6004960	have been staked on as external and alien.
6004960	6008480	The career you've always wanted since you were four, the type of person you wanted to
6008480	6012680	marry since childhood, the political cause that you've dedicated your life to, your
6012680	6019280	core desires will likely be thoroughly alienated and shown to be external and perhaps even
6019280	6020560	perverse.
6020560	6023720	The medic theory could also alienate you from others.
6023720	6028280	From this point going forward, you will have trouble fully participating in any political
6028280	6034000	or collective activity, always aware of the deceitfulness of mimesis and the madness of
6034000	6035000	crowds.
6035000	6037480	Second, inaction.
6037480	6041240	Drard is the most ambivalent writer that I've ever come across.
6041240	6043400	What should we do with escape going?
6043400	6046000	Well, on one hand, it's a huge lie.
6046000	6050320	You're killing innocents, but on the other, it is the only way that pagan societies have
6050320	6051320	brought peace.
6052040	6055200	Should we fight to remove caste systems?
6055200	6060480	Well, if you don't, then you will subject people to arbitrary distinction, meaningless
6060480	6062800	oppression grounded on nothing but lies.
6062800	6067400	But if you do, you open them up to competition of all against all.
6067400	6071760	Metaphysical desire will burn through their communities and set it ablaze.
6071760	6074760	Should we participate in capitalism?
6074760	6080720	Capitalism is a competitive cesspool of violent energies that has brought about the most lovely
6080760	6084000	prosperous and peaceful society known to date.
6084000	6087800	If you are looking for clear-cut answers or even answers at all, you've come knocking
6087800	6088800	on the wrong door.
6088800	6090760	Go to a Marx or Hegel instead.
6090760	6096840	The extreme ambivalence in all of Drard's ideas, in addition to his deep pessimism on
6096840	6102800	the human condition and history, tends to incapacitate those who've digested them a
6102800	6104520	bit too thoroughly.
6104600	6111000	Third, and certainly not least, the side effect of Drard is hopelessness.
6111000	6114680	By now, the point should be familiar.
6114680	6117080	Apocalypse is imminent.
6117080	6122840	There is nothing you, nor I, nor anyone can do about it.
6122840	6129400	If you do wish to remain hopeful after understanding and digesting Drard, just know that that
6129400	6133800	hope is going to have to come from you and not Drard.
6133800	6139520	You are going to have to dig yourself and all of us out of this apocalyptic hole Drard
6139520	6144800	really has nothing left to offer.
6144800	6147280	Turn back while you still can.
6147280	6149680	I have warned you thus.
6149680	6156520	Now, to those stubborn or perhaps morbidly curious enough to continue, I can only heed
6156520	6163640	one last time, against continuing on these lectures, by echoing what Dante inscribed
6163640	6168360	on the gates of hell, abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
