1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,980
No philosopher has influenced my thinking more than RenÃ© Girard.

2
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:24,080
He showed me how I was caught up in meaningless status competitions, and how much I was driven

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,440
by desires that weren't even my own.

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,600
And I wasn't the only one.

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:36,880
Too many of my peers were miserable pursuing things not because they actually wanted them,

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,400
but because society told them to.

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:47,240
And sometimes, I look back and wonder how I ever functioned without Girard's ideas.

8
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:54,080
I see how swept up I was in vain pursuits, pointless social games, and status signaling,

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,680
which Girard exposed and rescued me from.

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:04,080
And if there were ever a set of ideas that radically changed my life, these would be it.

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,760
The journey of acquiring these ideas, however, was a long and painful struggle.

12
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,160
Girard's writing is hard to understand, his theories seem antiquated and abstract, and

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,200
his books jump from idea to idea without an apparent structure.

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,640
This is why the series exists.

15
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,240
Over the next seven lectures, we're going to cover the entirety of Girard's system

16
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:37,160
in a structured and understandable way, while exploring the relevance of his ideas for the

17
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,200
contemporary world.

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,440
My name is David Perrell, and I'm going to be moderating these lectures, which are

19
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,480
made possible by the generous grant of Tyler Cowan's Emergent Ventures Program.

20
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,120
As your host, I'll be listening and learning here with you.

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,760
And with that, I'd like to introduce our lecturer, Jonathan B.

22
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,680
Jonathan, I know you're busy.

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Thanks for taking the time.

24
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Thanks for having me.

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,080
If you're going to do all the hard work of setting up and I can just ramble on philosophy,

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,760
you can have me any time of the week.

27
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,560
Well, I'm glad you could be here.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,160
And before you introduce us to Girard, I'd like to introduce you to our audience.

29
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,760
And I want to start with how we met.

30
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,920
I was hosting a philosophy discussion group in New York City.

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,480
And at the time, we were reading Augustine's City of God.

32
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,680
And I remember you being on the other side of the room, and you start sharing.

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
And I was so impressed with the rigor and the intensity of your discussion.

34
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,960
I was like, who is this guy?

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,360
And so we became fast friends.

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,120
I audited your philosophy class at Columbia.

37
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,680
Now we both live in Austin, Texas, where we must have dinner together two, three nights

38
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,360
a week.

39
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,120
And in that time, I've been very impressed.

40
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,600
And what stands out the most is just the discipline and the thoughtfulness that you bring to philosophy.

41
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,520
And what I would like to do now is talk a little bit about how you got here today.

42
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,920
So you were born in China, where you were raised between Beijing and later moved to

43
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,240
Vancouver, and you spent most of your formative years training in Olympiad math.

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,920
At 15, you won a Canadian gold medal in the Pascal mathematics competition.

45
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,080
At 17, you were an invitee to the Canadian mathematical Olympiad.

46
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,800
At 18, you were awarded a full ride scholarship at Columbia, where you studied computer science

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,480
as one of the top 20 Eggleston scholars in a class of over 2,000 people.

48
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,040
At 20, you finished your computer science degree.

49
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,640
And that's when you were introduced to Gerard.

50
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,440
And because of Gerard, you pursued a second degree in philosophy, where you focused on

51
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,200
continental social philosophy and Buddhist theory.

52
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,680
At 22, immediately after graduation, you started building a fintech startup with Joe

53
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,840
Lonsdale, which you've been working on for the past year.

54
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,480
Now, did I get that right?

55
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,200
Yeah, I think factually that is correct.

56
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,920
Although I don't know about the exact ages, I'm a bit worried that you've hyped me up

57
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,520
a bit too much.

58
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,360
Perhaps not unlike our equity markets, you've set me up so high that there's only one direction

59
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,360
that I can go from here and that's down.

60
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,480
Although in terms of the question of whether you miss anything, I think you did miss quite

61
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,400
a few important things to no fault of your own because no one gives introductions this

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,400
way that are relevant to my engagement with Gerard.

63
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,640
And those are all the personal failures and the suffering that I've had along the way

64
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,040
that really led me to Gerard.

65
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,720
I suspect this is probably a much broader point that when you give an introduction to a Gerardian

66
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,280
that you should highlight perhaps their failures just as much if not more than their successes

67
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,400
because it's often their failures that really drive them to Gerard.

68
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,960
I don't think Gerardian insights are rewarded, shall we say, in the victory of a triumph,

69
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,080
but you have to go out there and scavenge them from your fields of defeat.

70
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:57,000
And so it wasn't out of a mindset of achievement or even a leisurely strolling into Gerard

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,680
out of theoretical curiosity that I was acquainted with him, but I crawled to him out of a desperate

72
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,000
existential necessity.

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,280
So then how did you find your way to Gerard?

74
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,160
Yeah, well, like I mentioned, it's mostly personal suffering and strife, but maybe to

75
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:21,120
be a bit more specific, like many other teenagers, certainly ambitious teenagers, I was struggling

76
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,800
quite a bit in my first years at Columbia, not academically, not professionally, not socially,

77
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,600
but in a deep personal existential sense.

78
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,960
As a freshman at an elite college, I, if you'll excuse a funny metaphor, think you

79
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,400
kind of end up in a zoo with 2,000 other hyper conscious, status-oriented,

80
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,480
procedure-seeking teenagers.

81
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,720
And the one word that I think which captures the existential problem of such a community

82
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,520
well is hollowness.

83
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,920
And now this wasn't true for everyone, but most of us weren't really doing things, I

84
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:03,240
think, for their own sake, but out of what Gerard would call mimesis or natural capacity

85
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,560
and tendency to imitate others.

86
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,080
I mean, think about it like this, 2,000 of, allegedly, some of America's smartest and

87
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:18,320
most independent kids all end up after college wanting to go into four fields, finance, tech,

88
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,160
law, and then medicine.

89
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,720
And during college, we were supporting political causes we didn't care about to fly the right

90
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
colors.

91
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,520
We hung out with the right people, we wanted to see and dating the right person, and we

92
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,040
worked our asses off hustling for prestigious internships that a lot of us actually secretly

93
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,680
loathed.

94
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,320
And I think what made this all so much more perverse was that we had to lie to ourselves

95
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:49,280
to sustain these pursuits, that if we just squinted hard enough and intoxicated ourselves

96
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,720
in the equally drunken rhetoric of our peers, that we could fool ourselves into thinking

97
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,240
that this path of prestige is the right one for us to really be on.

98
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,800
And what was so existentially depressing, if you will, about such a life was not the

99
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,040
presence of wrong.

100
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,760
You know, we weren't being tortured, we weren't starving, but it's the absence of right.

101
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:18,240
That even the victories felt so hollow and meaningless, like getting a prestigious internship.

102
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,360
That was a one day or three day buzz that went away as fast as it came.

103
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,480
And I think these victories were so meaningless because they weren't out of our own genuine

104
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,560
desires, but a product of mimesis, what we felt like we had to do out of some kind of

105
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,800
social pressure.

106
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,320
And what was the wake up call for me was in my sophomore year, seeing where this path

107
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,160
of mimesis was leading me down towards.

108
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,320
I was talking with Dalt, some of them in alumni living and working in Manhattan, and these

109
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,920
were the guys who had made it, right?

110
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,640
They had the right postal code, they had the right job, they had a hot partner, but they

111
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,960
were fundamentally plagued with the same type of existential problems.

112
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,480
They were making money they didn't need to buy shit that they didn't want, to impress

113
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,880
people they didn't particularly like.

114
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:12,320
And in them, I saw the same despair and hollowness, but in some sense, just even worse because

115
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,840
it's developed a bit further out.

116
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,680
And how can you not be hollow when you're living life in such a way where you're motivated

117
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,280
not by a core, strong, impetus of genuine desire, but this external shell of social

118
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
expectation?

119
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,720
Yeah, I see this all over the place.

120
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,080
I see the influence of a medic theory in so many aspects of society.

121
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,560
You see it with people take out a loan to buy some fancy car and they don't have the

122
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,320
money to do it.

123
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,520
You see it in the way that management consultants, you'll be talking to them and they'll talk

124
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,960
about the director level title at the company as if that's the salvation that's going to

125
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,760
make them happy forever.

126
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,840
They get it now.

127
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,800
They're no happier once they get that, but the worst kind of mimetic competition that

128
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,720
I saw was in high school.

129
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,920
And there was this weird thing where the parents would be really competitive and conniving

130
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,400
over where their children would go to schools like a status competition among them.

131
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,080
And they wanted their kids to go to Ivy's, these prestigious schools and the trophy at

132
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:26,000
the end was those bumper stickers on the back of the Mercedes with the university logo.

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,680
And I saw how through mimesis that people had lost their own way and they weren't even

134
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,760
aware of the nature of their own desire.

135
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,600
And I think it's this lack of awareness that if you don't have a proper understanding of

136
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,680
these forces makes it so easily for us, especially in today's modern society, to get caught up

137
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,960
in these forces.

138
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,920
And I think throughout college, I started getting a more and more intimate awareness

139
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,840
of the logic behind all of these phenomena that you experienced, not because I was above

140
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,840
the fold.

141
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,680
If anything, I was so aware of it because I was the most guilty, I was the most mimetic

142
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,680
of them all.

143
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,080
And what was so frightening to me was the realization as a sophomore that I could live

144
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,280
my entire life like this, fundamentally not for myself.

145
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,040
I knew I had to change before it was too late.

146
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,400
And I knew that there was a point where it was going to be too late, where the ship was

147
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,880
going to get too much speed, where if you'll human another metaphor, the daggers too deep

148
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,960
in the old king's heart.

149
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,760
Fortunately, in the pits of mind despair, I was introduced to the work of RenÃ© Girard.

150
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,640
And so Girard saved me.

151
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,800
And I really do mean that in a very literal sense of the term, in the same way that Virgil

152
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:50,280
saved Dante by exposing to him the manifestations and the mechanisms behind human evil, as well

153
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,680
as guiding his purging of more milder forms of perversion.

154
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,240
Now, Girard saved me by presenting to me a theory of human nature that explained the

155
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,120
true origin of desire and its terrifying consequences, if not directed properly.

156
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,760
He gave me a more accurate map with which I myself could slowly unravel and untangle

157
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,200
myself from the memetic web.

158
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,560
And with this lecture series, my hope is to be able to gift this map to you and our listeners

159
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
as well.

160
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,520
So Jonathan, I got to ask you, is the power of Girard's ideas that they're going to stop

161
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,680
making us be memetic?

162
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:34,720
Or do you still feel like you're still as prone to chasing prestige and envy as before?

163
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Yeah, you're definitely right.

164
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,120
It's definitely the latter.

165
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:43,520
Girard's ideas do not work on us by magically making us stop being memetic and social creatures.

166
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,120
In the same environment, I would say I'm just as susceptible to memetic forces as I was

167
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
before.

168
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,720
But his theory does have practical personal benefits.

169
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,960
Let me explain with an analogy.

170
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,840
I think there was a military theorist by the name of John Boyd.

171
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,000
And he said something, I'm going to have to paraphrase here, I don't know the exact quote,

172
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,920
like superior fighter pilots use their superior judgment to make sure they get into situations

173
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,080
where they never have to use their superior skill.

174
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:19,360
And the idea under that line is that what's perhaps more important than the ability to

175
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,200
deal with that situation is the foresight and judgment to fundamentally not get into

176
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
those situations.

177
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,520
And I think the same is true for what Girard has done for me.

178
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:36,080
When I am, say, already deeply envious or deeply prideful, the battle is already lost.

179
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,720
There's nothing that understanding Girard and memetic theory rationally can do for me.

180
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,240
The medic theory, however, gives me a framework to avoid situations which inspire debilitating

181
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,520
envy, which ignites sort of unproductive pride.

182
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,000
It tells us what type of person to avoid and who to have close.

183
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,320
It teaches us how to construct a social environment that is relatively sober and how to identify

184
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,440
ones that are prone to memetic contagion.

185
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,120
Memetic theory does not give us the power to resist damaging instances of memesis in

186
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,600
the moment, but it does give us the foresight to avoid them altogether.

187
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:20,280
So do you think Girard is worthy of engagement because of how therapeutic he is, how he can

188
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,200
rescue us from suffering?

189
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,880
Yeah, I would say the answer is probably yes and no, but perhaps let me answer that with

190
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,320
an anecdote.

191
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,920
One of Girard's collaborators was asked that similar question that why he was a Girardian.

192
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,560
And he answered, because it's cheaper than psychoanalysis.

193
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,720
Now this is supposed to be humorous, and the literal and perhaps uninteresting interpretation

194
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,720
is that you don't have to pay anyone to study Girard's ideas, but it can still have a therapeutic

195
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,920
effect of solving your problems.

196
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:56,000
But there's a much more interesting reading, I think, that cheaper here means economic,

197
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,560
being able to explain a much more phenomenon with much less assumptions and not just personal

198
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,760
therapeutic phenomena, but social historical as well.

199
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,360
Take the example of Freud and psychoanalysis, if you're familiar with that.

200
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,400
He had this idea of the Oedipus complex, right, where the son is rivaled with the father

201
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
and he the son desires the mother.

202
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,800
That's a very heavy, heavy assumption that we all have this inbuilt desire to have sex

203
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,800
with mom.

204
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,880
And it can only explain one set of phenomena.

205
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:30,040
Girard's memetic theory takes the same example, but sees humans as naturally imitative and

206
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,520
desire as contagious between people, including between father and son.

207
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,600
And as a result, the medical theory can explain not only the Oedipus complex, but a much broader

208
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,160
set of psychological, social, historical phenomenon where people desire similar things and then

209
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
enter into rivalry.

210
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:53,800
Hence, memetic theory is cheaper than psychoanalysis, doing much more with much less.

211
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:59,640
So I think Girard, to answer your question directly now, is probably only so therapeutic

212
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,400
because he hits on fundamental truths of the human condition.

213
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,240
Truths which are overlooked, or perhaps even more provocatively, systematically hidden

214
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,960
by modernity.

215
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:15,360
And these truths help us not only understanding ourselves, but understanding the world and

216
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,720
even the trajectory of history.

217
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,160
I think Girard's ideas help us navigate the world and help us see opportunity where others

218
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,680
may see barren land and see danger where most people have already let their guard down.

219
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,040
Let me give you a direct example here that I prepared for later on, but I think it's

220
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,880
a very fitting example here.

221
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,040
And it'll go to show the unique predictive power of Girard's theory in the social world,

222
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,480
beyond just personal therapy, because I don't want us to trivialize memetic theory.

223
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,960
The example I'm going to give is quite timely.

224
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,880
It has to do with the relationship between China-America, the Sino-American relationship.

225
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:01,600
Against the crowd, Girard in 2007 anticipated the deterioration of the Sino-American relationship.

226
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:08,800
And you have to recall and remember how contrarian and unlikely such a prediction was in 2007.

227
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,160
I mean, remember that in the 2000s and certainly in the 90s, a dominant view was that China's

228
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,680
relationship with the West was only going to get better and better through economic

229
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,180
liberalization.

230
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,320
And I think such a view, which obviously seems hopelessly naive these days, was grounded

231
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,640
on two flawed premises that were accepted.

232
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,080
The first one was that China's rise would sort of lift the boats of the world economy

233
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,840
and make most people in the West richer through cheaper goods and therefore much happier.

234
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,920
Many people in the West would be happy with China's rise.

235
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,760
And the second point, the second assumption that this optimistic view was grounded on

236
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,880
was that the increasing similarity between China and the West would lead to political

237
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
harmony.

238
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,600
The idea went something like, you know, as Chinese people started watching Western movies,

239
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,680
as they started idolizing American sports, as they wanted to send their kids to Ivy

240
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,240
Leagues, that their values would be much closer aligned to that of the Americans and therefore

241
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,040
much less conflictual.

242
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,720
Now, Gerard's memetic understanding of human nature enabled him to see through the flaws

243
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,760
of both assumptions.

244
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,760
On the first point, we are not rational, utility maximizing creatures, but social creatures

245
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,240
prone to relativistic comparison.

246
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,480
For Gerard, America would be more unsettled, even if it were richer, but its gap between

247
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,040
China and closed down.

248
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,520
The absolute increase in goods mattered little to humans compared to a change in relativistic

249
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,160
social standing.

250
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,080
And on the second point, Gerard believes that its similarity, rather than difference,

251
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:43,160
that causes individuals and nations to enter into conflict.

252
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,600
Desiring a similar set of objects would open up the two nations to a larger surface area

253
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,440
of competition and therefore potential conflict and even violence.

254
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,880
And so, at the peak of Sino-American optimism in 2007, and this was right before 2008, where

255
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,520
the congeniality between the East and the West had never been greater, Gerard stood

256
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,800
against the crowd and warned us of such a conflict, a conflict that will come from the

257
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,920
very mechanism that most thought would establish peace, trade.

258
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,360
Let me read you a quote directly from Gerard.

259
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,400
A conflict between the United States and China will follow.

260
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Everything is in place.

261
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,160
But it will not necessarily occur on the military level at first.

262
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,560
Trade can transform very quickly into war.

263
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:33,360
From this point of view, we can reasonably fear a major clash between China and the United

264
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,680
States in coming decades.

265
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,600
This looming conflict between the United States and China has nothing to do with a clash of

266
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
civilizations.

267
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,560
In fact, the dispute is between two forms of capitalism that are becoming more and more

268
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,560
similar.

269
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,560
End quote.

270
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:55,360
Of course, 15 years later, Gerard proves depressingly correct.

271
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,400
We are in the midst of this very trade war, and relationships have deteriorated beyond

272
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,960
what most could have possibly imagined in the 2000s.

273
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,440
So I hope this is a satisfying, albeit somewhat startling, answer to your question of why

274
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,780
Gerard is worth engaging.

275
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:17,240
Not only does he help us understand and I think manage the part of ourselves most important

276
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:23,000
but previously opaque to us, I think his theory also enables us to understand the world and

277
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,600
human society in a different and often much more predictive light.

278
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,960
But before we jump too far ahead, if it's okay with you, I'd like to give an overview

279
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,040
on the structure of these lecture series as a whole.

280
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
Please do.

281
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,880
Why don't you take the lead and I'll jump in with questions and comments.

282
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
Great.

283
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,080
I have two goals over the next seven lectures, one theoretical and one practical.

284
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,680
Theoretically, I aim to give you an encompassing overview of Gerard's entire theory, from his

285
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:56,200
psychology to his theology, from his theory on human evolution to predictions for apocalypse,

286
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,120
from readings on Greek literature to his critique of modern institutions.

287
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,760
I will present to you the entirety of Gerard's system.

288
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,880
Practically, I wish to show you how this theoretical system applies to your life in

289
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,840
modern society through bountiful historical and contemporary examples.

290
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,960
We're going to analyze through a Gerardian lens, of course, celebrity advertisement,

291
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,320
romantic relationships, ritual sacrifice, the relationship between COVID and social

292
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,680
unrest, the invention of coinage, social media, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand,

293
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,800
the genesis of law, modern victimhood culture, the philosophical basis of innovation and

294
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,160
much, much more.

295
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,800
My goal is not to leave you stranded with sterile intellectual concepts, but to give

296
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:45,240
you a map with which you can identify the Gerardian forces animating our world and your

297
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,600
life in order to navigate its relatively choppy waters.

298
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:57,680
Now, I've prepared these lectures for a public audience at an intermediate undergraduate difficulty.

299
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,080
That is to say, it's not going to be a walk in the park, but no prerequisites are necessary

300
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,880
to understand these lectures.

301
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,280
Now, we are going to engage quite frequently with the Western philosophical canon, the

302
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,280
Hagels and Plato's and Rousseau's of the world.

303
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,520
We're also going to be engaged, perhaps even more frequently, with the world's literary

304
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,640
mythical canon, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Hindu hymn to Purusha, the Iliad, the Odyssey,

305
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:28,040
Sophocles, Shakespeare, but rest assured, all of these, along with core Gerardian concepts,

306
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,280
will be properly contextualized and introduced.

307
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,520
There's no prerequisites for these series of lectures other than interest.

308
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,720
Now, specifically, the ordering of these lectures are such.

309
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,640
This lecture, lecture one, will give an overview of Gerard's life and his work.

310
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,520
It is a condensed summary of this entire lecture series for people who are short on time but

311
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,680
still want to get a brief taste of Gerard, if you will.

312
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:58,120
Now, moving on, lecture two and three, we're going to discuss Gerard's psychology.

313
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,520
Gerard focuses on, as you probably can already tell, the memetic parts of human nature, our

314
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,080
capacity and tendency towards imitation.

315
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,200
Now, with this psychological grounding, in lectures four to seven, we will dive into

316
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,000
Gerard's philosophy of history, which starts from the very beginning, man's evolution

317
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,040
from ape, and goes to the very end, our imminent apocalypse.

318
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,680
Gerard thinks the world is literally going to end very, very soon.

319
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,640
Now, given that we're going to be talking about such weighty concepts such as apocalypse,

320
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,080
the literal end of the world, I wanted to throw out a quick disclaimer here so that I don't

321
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,040
receive either undeserved credit or misdirected anger.

322
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,120
All of the ideas I'm about to share with you are not mine, but the most charitable reconstruction

323
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,400
to Gerard.

324
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,040
This is not me, but my interpretation of Gerard.

325
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:50,400
Now, I have many theological, methodological, psychological disagreements, strong points

326
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,040
of contention with Gerard, and I could do a whole lecture series just on my reasons for

327
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,960
those disagreements, but this is not interpreting B, it's interpreting Gerard.

328
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,480
I will present to you the most charitable interpretation of Gerard I can muster, even

329
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,400
if I privately disagree with him, some of them at least, because I've been taught in

330
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,280
a philosophical, pedagogical tradition that sees the lecture, me, not as a door-to-door

331
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:22,480
salesman of a single product, but as a wandering merchant with a whole caravan of goods.

332
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,960
I shouldn't be in the business of knocking down your door and shoving my single ideas

333
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,760
down your throat, regardless of what your needs are.

334
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,800
Instead, I should open up my little merchant caravan of ideas and try to argue the best

335
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:41,000
I can for each idea in my inventory for why they are attractive so that you, the listener,

336
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,240
can have the agency to make that decision.

337
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,600
But before I show you my Gerardian wear, so to speak, let me give you a brief introduction

338
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,400
about the man behind the theory.

339
00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:02,440
On December 25, 1923, RenÃ© NoÃ«l Theophile Gerard was born as the second of five children

340
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:08,680
to a Catholic, learned mother and an anticlerical archivist father in Avignon, France.

341
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,400
Gerard's father had served, he'd lost a brother, he'd been wounded himself in World

342
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,760
War I, and passed his views on the meaninglessness of conflict onto Gerard.

343
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,680
And I think this view was further corroborated as Gerard spent his formative adolescent years

344
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,000
in France under Nazi occupation.

345
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Now, of course, as anyone in that place and that time period, the cruelty of the Nazis

346
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,640
left an imprint on Gerard.

347
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,960
But so did the cruelty of the French resistance.

348
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,640
You see, once they had been liberated by the Allies, the French resistance, now in control

349
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,480
of France, started scapegoating and persecuting anyone who had tangential affiliations to the

350
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,320
Nazis during the time of occupation.

351
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,640
Often these victims were innocent.

352
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,000
Many innocents, mostly women too vulnerable to defend themselves, were scapegoated by

353
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,960
the French mob, blamed for Nazi collaboration.

354
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,160
They were humiliated, dragged around on the street, and often killed without trial on

355
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,240
groundless accusations.

356
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,040
Let me read you of the vivid scenes depicted by Gerard's biographer.

357
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,480
Some of them were young mothers with no means of support, motivated by hunger and need rather

358
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,040
than by treason or even desire.

359
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,160
Some were unmarried schoolteachers who were forced to meet with German soldiers in their

360
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
homes.

361
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,520
Others were restless teenage girls who just flirted with the foreign soldiers.

362
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,760
One was a charwoman who cleaned the German military headquarters.

363
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,800
There were no trials, only stylized rituals of retribution, a shameful carnival that

364
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:43,280
often included stripping these women to their underwear and loading them onto trucks to drive

365
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,960
around the town.

366
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,560
They were exhibited to the sound of drum rolls shouting and cat calls, as if the trucks

367
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:58,280
were tumbles in 1789 the French Revolution had come alive again.

368
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:05,000
These scenes of innocence being scapegoated will leave a lasting imprint on Gerard and

369
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,700
be a common thread throughout his work, both the meanlessness, deceitfulness, and arbitrariness

370
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:15,140
of conflict, and the perennial need of troubled human societies to find innocent victims to

371
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,300
blame and murder for catharsis.

372
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:24,020
Now, Gerard's intellectual trajectory, on the other hand, could be described as anti-institutional

373
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,020
and unorthodox through and through.

374
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,020
He was always an outsider.

375
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,740
He was an outsider from the very beginning, unable to bear regular school.

376
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:36,340
He had to go to a private tutoring program, reading at his heart's content and not to

377
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,460
the dictates of any syllabus.

378
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,820
He was trained in Indiana University in history, but his generative curiosity soon overflowed

379
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,540
the boundaries of his diploma.

380
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,980
He made little contributions to history and was self-taught and an outsider in all the

381
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,900
major fields that he did actually contribute to.

382
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,820
First, he made his mark in literary theory by articulating the idea of memesis through

383
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,780
close readings of literature.

384
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:06,980
Next, he jumped disciplines into anthropology, where he shed light on the need for scapegoating,

385
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:12,340
and then he jumped disciplines once more to theology, mounting a serious defense for

386
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,340
Christianity.

387
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:18,620
Now, despite being accepted into the prestigious French Academy and holding professorships

388
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:24,180
at John Hopkins, Buffalo, and Stanford, Gerard still remains, to some extent, an outsider

389
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,820
in all of these disciplines.

390
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,300
The literary theorists have been with him for not respecting the methods and conventions

391
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,820
and fashions of the day.

392
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:35,900
The anthropologists distrust his liberal use of evidence and lack of field work, and even

393
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,500
parts of the Christian community have shunned him for his quite unorthodox reading of the

394
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
crucifixion.

395
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:48,260
So, the title of this lecture series is called Interpreting Gerard, Exigit of Apocalypse.

396
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,940
Why do you call him an exigit?

397
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,820
Why not philosopher or maybe something more provocative like prophet?

398
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,860
Yeah, yeah, well, that's a good question.

399
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:01,340
We're not in the business of drama here, so I think I skipped prophet, but mostly I

400
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,700
call him an exigit because that's what he called himself, and I wanted to have respect

401
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,380
for his self-conception.

402
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:12,460
You see, he explicitly, in interviews, rejected both terms, philosopher and prophet, and I

403
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,100
think it would just simply be too narrow to call him a literary theorist, an anthropologist,

404
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,100
or a theologian.

405
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:23,780
Now, an exigit is someone who performs exegesis, the interpretation of scripture.

406
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:28,580
And I think that is the most accurate way to understand Gerard's system and the vast

407
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,900
terrain that he is forced to traverse.

408
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:36,420
You know, he's less a careful analytical philosopher, but a visionary expanding and

409
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:42,580
articulating a moral insight informed by scripture through all of these domains.

410
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,660
I get a feeling that reading Gerard, for him, these vast domains weren't these divergent

411
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,580
disciplines, these separate buckets that he was dipping his toes into, but simply different

412
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,620
manifestations of the same core insight.

413
00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:00,580
And I think Gerard's aim wasn't to revolutionize literary criticism, anthropology, or theology,

414
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:06,660
but to articulate what he conceived to be the core insight of Christianity.

415
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:11,580
Now that we have some context on Gerard the man, let's move on to the meat and bones,

416
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,500
the meat and potatoes of this lecture, which is a brief summary of Gerard's system.

417
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,380
I will attempt to give a reduced and simplistic summary of this entire lecture series, which

418
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:27,180
covers the entirety of memetic theory, sharing with you Gerard's key concepts and conclusions,

419
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:31,700
but probably not the full reasons and repercussions behind these conclusions.

420
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,620
Here I will trade precision for breadth.

421
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:38,700
Now for people who don't have the time for the full 10 plus hour lecture series, first

422
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,220
shame on you, but secondly, this could be a summary that should be sufficient for you

423
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,420
to get a taste of Gerard.

424
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:51,700
Now for those who are embarking on the full journey with us, I think this summary can be

425
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:58,340
a map for the expansive, tumultuous, and dizzying terrain ahead for you to gain your

426
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,060
sea legs and get an orientation of the landscape.

427
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:06,060
The best way for me to give you a taste of Gerard's system in one telling is to give

428
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:11,460
a comprehensive history of humanity, beginning from man's evolution from ape, all the way

429
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,100
to apocalypse.

430
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,780
I'll start by summarizing Gerard's psychology, how he thought humans were psychologically

431
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:23,060
different from animals, then I will articulate the problems this unique psychology created

432
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,620
for early human societies and their respective solutions.

433
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:31,780
And after that, I will detail how Christianity represents a meaningful rupture for Gerard

434
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,620
from these early societies.

435
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:38,540
And lastly, I will articulate how Christianity brought us all the way here to majority and

436
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,780
how it will imminently deliver us to violent apocalypse.

437
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,780
So let us begin with psychology.

438
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:52,260
Gerard's apocalyptic conclusions begin with a rather innocuous observation, mimesis.

439
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:58,700
What defined for Gerard are evolutionary breaking away from our great ape cousins is not reason,

440
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:06,060
it's not truth, it's mimesis, our gradually increasing capacity and tendency for imitation.

441
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:11,100
The best metaphor I can think of to explain mimesis is that of co-vibrating violin strings.

442
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,460
When you put two violin strings together in close proximity, as you flick one, a similar

443
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,420
frequency of vibrational translate to the other.

444
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,980
And I think in a like manner, Gerard identifies a species of human behavior, and here I use

445
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:29,740
behavior for the lack of a better word in the largest sense possible, actions, experiences,

446
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:36,180
judgments, intentions, that proceed also from copying an external instance of that behavior.

447
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:42,260
Now humans are social animals through and through, prone to this type of co-vibration.

448
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:46,620
Just as strings on a violin aren't independent, neither are we.

449
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:52,740
Mimesis is the fundamental capacity and tendency to gain access to the subjectivity of others,

450
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,980
as well as to reproduce objective cultural forms.

451
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:01,300
In other words, mimesis is what constitutes us as social beings, and makes us different

452
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,780
from other animals.

453
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:09,660
This tendency to ingest the behaviors and values what have you of those around us is

454
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:14,980
why perhaps prestige and recognition matter so much to us humans.

455
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,820
When a majority of a social group that you're immersed in believe something is good or beautiful

456
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,660
or believe something should be done in this way or that, we tend to slowly take on and

457
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,540
ingest those positions as well through mimesis.

458
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:31,060
And I think our everyday notions of prestige already have an understanding of mimesis.

459
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,420
When we say something is prestigious, we are perhaps also saying that on its own it

460
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,780
does not deserve the value we attribute to it, right?

461
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:44,340
When we call prestigious, Rolex, Harvard, Bentley, maybe not Cornell, but the other

462
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:49,140
actual prestigious things, partially what we're saying is that the value we attribute

463
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:55,260
to it is not fully accounted for by the objects themselves, but that there's some surplus

464
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,580
value where the object doesn't deserve.

465
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:02,700
Gerard would say that that surplus value does not come from the object, but our peers value

466
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,100
it and us ingesting their opinions through mimesis.

467
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:12,020
Now for Gerard, mimesis in everything, but everything to some degree is memetic.

468
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,260
The rush of adrenaline that infects you in a roaring and lively sporting stadium, the

469
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:21,020
tribalism of politics, the madness of cults and how they sustain each other's delusions,

470
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:26,180
the passing on of accents, even as animal, as an activity of replenishing ourselves

471
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:31,340
drinking water, we may still call to mind, however subtly, how our favorite athletes

472
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,300
drinks a Gatorade, right?

473
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,140
That's the purpose of those commercials to get that in your head.

474
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,700
This is how broad and all pervasive mimesis operates.

475
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,820
Humanity for Gerard would be completely unrecognizable without it.

476
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,260
The species of a memetic behavior that most concerns Gerard in both senses of the word

477
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,260
is desire.

478
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:55,020
It's fine and dandy when what mimesis transmits is accents or cultural codes, but when mimesis

479
00:33:55,020 --> 00:34:00,460
converges the desires of people, well, that invites them into competition, conflict, and

480
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,740
often violence.

481
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,100
Gerard separates the entirety of human desires into two species.

482
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:12,260
The desire to be, which he terms metaphysical desire, and the desire to experience, which

483
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,020
he terms physical desire.

484
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,940
Metaphysical desire is directed at what objects say about me.

485
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,780
Physical desire is directed at an experience confirmed by the qualities of the object

486
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,780
itself.

487
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,500
Let me give you a few examples to clarify.

488
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,500
I can pursue, for example, sex for the experience out of physical desire, and what I would be

489
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,700
after there would be pleasure or intimacy, feelings in the moment, but I can also pursue

490
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:43,340
sex for being, what having sex with a certain type of person really says about me, right?

491
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,340
And this is a real psychology that people have.

492
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,900
This is the psychology of the Don Juan or the Coquette.

493
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:54,300
For these people, sex is no longer about sex, but something more core to their identity.

494
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,540
They are not out there to experience something, but to prove something.

495
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,940
Or take another more trivial and mundane example.

496
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,460
I can buy a car for the experience.

497
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,500
The trouble it would save me from walking everywhere, but I can also buy a car because

498
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,140
I want to be a certain type of person because I just want to have the coolest car on the

499
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,060
block and have people admire me.

500
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:18,140
You, for example, David, I must applaud you because clearly from your car, I can tell

501
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,060
that you're a very saintly man.

502
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,140
Clearly you do not care what the car says about you.

503
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,020
You are freed from metaphysical desire in this domain.

504
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,020
Congratulations.

505
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,020
I don't want to hear it.

506
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,540
My Toyota is beautiful, John.

507
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,380
Just please don't stop driving.

508
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:37,580
A reductive, but hopefully illuminating way to put this is that physical desire aims

509
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:41,740
at utility whereas metaphysical desire aims at identity.

510
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:46,980
Now, certainly this boundary between experience and being, between utility and identity is

511
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,980
not so clear.

512
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,500
You know, who we concede ourselves to be colors our experiences as much as our experiences

513
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:58,220
if ever so subtly shapes our self-conception, but just think about how drastically different

514
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,220
these experiences are.

515
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,220
Right?

516
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,700
Think about pursuing a profession because the work is engaging versus doing it because

517
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:09,660
it's the right job to have or dating a person because you like spending time with them versus

518
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:15,020
dating some person because you like to be seen with them or traveling to a place because

519
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:21,580
you're interested in the culture or because you just want to be seen in the coolest locale.

520
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:26,980
The distinction that Gerard has drawn here, if a bit muddied, is nonetheless meaningful,

521
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,620
especially at the extremes.

522
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:35,140
This desire to be at the heart of metaphysical desire is aimed at a fullness of being.

523
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:40,060
We want to exist, Gerard believes, in great measure.

524
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:45,340
Metaphysical desire takes form as a pursuit of objects in the broadest sense of the term.

525
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,980
Wanted to climb Mount Everest, wanted to build a unicorn company, wanted to study at an Ivy

526
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:54,980
League, or more mundane, buying a particular car, dating Sally instead of Susan, enjoying

527
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,580
a fancy restaurant.

528
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:02,100
But in all of these experiences, Gerard would say it's never objects we are really after.

529
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:07,460
I don't think this is a foreign concept to our this-worldly, achievement-focused consumer

530
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,460
society.

531
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:13,740
We want to acquire objects to bolster and back up our identity.

532
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:18,580
And the way we go about choosing which objects to go after, Gerard believes, is imitating

533
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:23,060
individuals whom we already consider to possess this fullness of being.

534
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:27,780
Celebrities, parental figures, entrepreneurs, and outstanding co-worker, we take on their

535
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,620
desires as our own.

536
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,740
The objects they value, as the objects we also strive for.

537
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:39,180
The faulty logic here, being that it must be the acquisition of these objects that grant

538
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,300
these models the fullness of their being.

539
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,860
Yeah, this reminds me of celebrity advertisements.

540
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,100
It does indeed, right?

541
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,500
You see a celebrity and you want what they want.

542
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,140
That's the whole logic behind these advertisements.

543
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,700
And I think the one line in celebrity advertisement that gives it all away is the tagline for

544
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,700
Jordan, Michael Jordan, sneakers, be like Mike.

545
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:06,180
What it's promising you isn't just a product or utility, but the being and prestige of

546
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,100
Michael Jordan, so that you can have a piece of that as well.

547
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,540
It's not jump like Mike.

548
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,300
It's not score like Mike.

549
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:17,900
The advertisement of basketball shoes doesn't talk about anything of the most important

550
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,940
physical qualities of the basketball shoes, and the lightness, the grip, the bounce.

551
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:28,700
It's promising you something you want all the more, being, be like Mike.

552
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:33,340
Draught's central thesis is that what often appears to be a subject pulled towards an

553
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,980
object due to the intrinsic value of that object is really the subject wanting to acquire

554
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,420
that object to be like some model.

555
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:44,620
What we are really after isn't the object, but the being of the model.

556
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:50,300
Whereas we think of desire as unidirectional, flowing from subject to object.

557
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:55,140
Draught thinks it's actually triangular, proceeding from subject through a model to

558
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,140
the object.

559
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:02,300
Because what is at stake in metaphysical desire is our identity, it is the strongest drive

560
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,660
in the human motivational repertoire.

561
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:08,940
I think it's quite obvious when we are motivated by such a drive because we can become obsessed

562
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,300
and compulsive.

563
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:15,300
We think that achievement, obtaining the objects that metaphysical desire wants, will

564
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,060
fully transform us.

565
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:21,220
I think in different stages of our lives, metaphysical desire usually directs us towards

566
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,500
a limited set of objects.

567
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:27,420
For me, first it was a specific toy that I really wanted, and then a weapon in World

568
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:31,740
of Warcraft, and then dating a person, and then an Ivy League, etc., etc.

569
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:36,380
I think we're always oriented at different stages in our lives towards something.

570
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:41,300
These are the objects pointed to by metaphysical desire.

571
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,700
These are objects in each period of our life that take on a disproportionate weight such

572
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,460
that you define progress as inching towards the object.

573
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:55,780
And whenever it slips away, however subtly, however minutely, your heart just thuds and

574
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,220
you feel a deep existential despair.

575
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,100
Romance provides a good example here.

576
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:08,020
Then you won't even be after the woman that you're interested in, and you won't be that

577
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,020
interested.

578
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:14,500
And what will happen is all of a sudden there's another suitor who comes along, and they are

579
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
interested in this woman.

580
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,780
And all of a sudden you get excited about this person too, and it is in that competition

581
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:25,100
that we are inflamed by the memetic spirit.

582
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:28,420
But then there's a second point here about this existential dread that we can feel.

583
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:34,180
We never feel those tremendous highs and lows in the early stages of talking to a woman

584
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,700
or something, and you'll be so excited because the texting is going well, and you'll be skipping

585
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,420
down the halls, and then all of a sudden she won't respond.

586
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,220
And you're freaking out, you're texting your friends what's going on here, you can't sleep

587
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:51,220
that night, and you wake up in the next morning, your alarm clock goes off, and you see a text,

588
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,220
and she's responded.

589
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:56,780
Now you jump out of bed and you wake up faster than a double shot of espresso.

590
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,700
That's precisely the right example to think of.

591
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:03,180
In fact, Drard would commonly go to romance as his canonical examples of metaphysical

592
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,580
desire and these two qualities you mentioned.

593
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:12,340
First, the object, not contributing anything or too much to desire, as well as these bipolar

594
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,340
swings.

595
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:18,020
All make romance, or at least the iterations you've described as textbook examples of

596
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,460
metaphysical desire.

597
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:26,420
And look, Drard's point is even in as intimate a domain as romance, our desires are, if you'd

598
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:31,060
excuse upon, helplessly penetrated by those of others.

599
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:36,300
Even our desires for our partners tend not to be informed fully by our partners, but

600
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,900
by people around them.

601
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:43,820
Drard's point is if even such a personal desire can be so external in origin, then

602
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,700
the same must also be true for other domains as well.

603
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,340
Career choice, political orientation, aesthetic taste, philosophical opinions.

604
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:58,660
This is a full-scale attack on the modern conception of individuals who can form their

605
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:04,580
own decisions with the reason to have an authentic core of desires to tap into.

606
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:10,660
Now, if this attack was not already threatening enough, Drard's next point will make it all

607
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:15,100
the more so and further problematize authenticity.

608
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:19,820
Just as memesis and metaphysical desire can make people conform, they can also make people

609
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,820
diverge.

610
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:26,540
But in another way, even a breaking away from the group in a so-called carving one's own

611
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,540
path can be radically socially determined.

612
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:35,340
When I think about it like this, the logic of metaphysical desire is to pursue the objects

613
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,820
associated with those who do have a fullness of being, right?

614
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:44,820
And so a natural continuation of this logic is to avoid or distance oneself from objects

615
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,580
associated with those we conceive to be as having a deficiency in being.

616
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:54,460
We both want to be like the cool kids, but also distant and be different from the social

617
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,460
outcasts.

618
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,180
Here's an example.

619
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,060
The tech elite with their plain t-shirts are not independent from Drard's perspective,

620
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:05,380
from the status games of finance-finally-addressed elite.

621
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:10,660
Even though they appear to be rejecting that game, in reality, it's merely the continuation

622
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,300
of the same game in a more accelerated form.

623
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:18,540
And when you think about it like this, showing up with a $5 t-shirt to a dinner where everyone

624
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:23,500
was wearing $500 suits is, in some sense, much more of a power play than showing up

625
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,220
with a $5,000 suit to the same dinner.

626
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,060
Because it's saying that I am so much better than you, that we aren't even playing the

627
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:37,020
same game, that I take your highest values, what you hold most here, as vulgar as nothing.

628
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:41,500
This is the logic of the negative phase of the mimesis, to distance oneself in order

629
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,780
to show one's superiority.

630
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:48,940
This breaking away from a group is no more authentic or independent than conformity,

631
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:53,700
because your choices are still made for what they say about you and not the object itself.

632
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:58,820
Now, in my own life decisions, if I may share a bit of a personal story, I think I've been

633
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:04,420
led astray by both the positive and the negative forces of mimesis.

634
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:08,940
I grew up idolizing entrepreneurs, the Steve Jobs of the world, and as soon as I got into

635
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:13,220
college, I felt like I had to drop out and start a company, ASAP.

636
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,980
And so I did.

637
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:19,220
My freshman spring, I dropped out, I raised a small round, and the company crashed and

638
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,020
burned out of vanity.

639
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:24,780
And it's not that I didn't enjoy building companies, that's not why I was led astray

640
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:30,060
by mimesis, but the degree to which I desired it, and the urgency of which I felt like I

641
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:34,860
had to achieve it, not unlike your romance example, was disproportionate to the value

642
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,740
of the object itself.

643
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:42,100
In other words, I desired being an entrepreneur and not necessarily the processes of building

644
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:44,060
a company.

645
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:48,620
Now, when I did go back to school as a sophomore a semester later, out of resentment for my

646
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:54,300
peers who had dropped out and did build successful companies, I think I went the other direction,

647
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,860
rejecting the worldly altogether, switching from CS to philosophy, going to a Buddhist

648
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,260
monastery.

649
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:04,700
For three years, I didn't do that much at all in industry, out of resentment.

650
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:11,540
Now, rejecting industry and building companies was my moral weapon to secure victory over

651
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:17,220
my more successful peers, to turn my failure into a triumph, but this was equally, if not

652
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,540
more inauthentic and perverse.

653
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:24,740
Now, the same story goes, it's not that I didn't enjoy philosophy and Buddhism, but

654
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,380
the degree to which I pursued it, and certainly the degree to which I renounced the world

655
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,580
was not genuine.

656
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:33,940
It wasn't reflective of how much I liked philosophical and meditative practice, and

657
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:39,460
certainly not how much I disliked the worldly, active life of industry.

658
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:44,460
And I think I really did miss out on valuable career opportunities because I was too resentful

659
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,260
to engage.

660
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,540
This carving of my own path was just as socially determined.

661
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,740
It was a form of coping so that I didn't have to feel lesser than my more successful

662
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,700
peers.

663
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:02,420
As a society, I think we all recognize this first move of conforming to this dropout culture

664
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:07,300
as socially determined, as prestige seeking, as not authentic, but I think the second move

665
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:12,740
of rejecting the group is just as socially determined, in that it was still primarily

666
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:19,020
the relationships with people that determined my choices, not for the choices themselves.

667
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:23,540
Admiration led me to converge in the first case, and resentment led me to diverge in

668
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,820
the second.

669
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:28,540
The direction is different, but the essence is the same.

670
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:33,260
But of course, in our society, to break away from the group, to carve one's own path,

671
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:39,340
so to speak, is thought to be a sure sign of independence, but that is not so.

672
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:44,180
Drard here is trying to tear down what he conceives of as the romantic lie.

673
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,860
The lie goes something like this.

674
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:51,540
At the bottom, we are all individuals, with a core of what we can call the authentic self.

675
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,740
And then there are these layers of social constraints, one on top of the other, with

676
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,980
the origins external.

677
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:03,580
The way to access authenticity, so this romantic lie goes, is by following one's heart, with

678
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:09,820
a bold, breaking free of the group, peeling away of these social layers.

679
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:12,220
Drard says not so fast.

680
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:18,420
This breaking free from the group can be just as socially determined as rigid adherence.

681
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:23,500
You're confusing difference for autonomy, you're confusing distance for independence,

682
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,700
and you're confusing originality for freedom.

683
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:33,100
The reality is, we can just as easily be socially determined by rejecting a group out of resentment,

684
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:37,460
as we can by conforming to the group out of admiration or peer pressure.

685
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:41,260
Memesis operates positively and negatively.

686
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:47,100
Memesis and metaphysical desire then, entrap us in every direction, both in conforming as

687
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,980
well as in breaking free.

688
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,260
Man is shown to be a social creature through and through.

689
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,820
If you take one thing from Drard's psychology, it is this.

690
00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:02,220
The most powerful and explanatory element within the human psyche is our sociality.

691
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:07,620
Our values, our political orientation, aesthetic taste, and even philosophical positions are

692
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:13,780
heavily, often primarily, determined by others in deep and often unconscious ways, and not

693
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,100
chosen for their own sake.

694
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,140
We may think our desires are our own.

695
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,620
We may think we desire our spouse just because of who they are, or at the very least because

696
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:26,540
of their physical attractiveness, but Drard shows that even this turns out not to be the

697
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:28,420
full extent of the story.

698
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:33,780
We may think reason can hold the reins and guide our decisions, but this social dimension

699
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:38,060
of ourselves is often much, much stronger.

700
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:44,460
Reason pretends to be its steward, but in reality is its lawyer and spokesperson, engaged

701
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,740
in, more often than not, post-hog rationalization.

702
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:51,660
Oh yeah, of course, you know, I want to be an entrepreneur because I want to change the

703
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:53,180
world for the better.

704
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,620
Or on the other hand, of course, I would never be an entrepreneur because industry is vulgar

705
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:59,900
and capitalism is immoral.

706
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:04,540
The reasons we give for our decisions often come after we've already sworn allegiance

707
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:08,100
to those decisions due to ulterior social motives.

708
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:13,740
Now for Drard, our memetic natures, the extent to which we are socially determined, is what

709
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:21,100
differentiates us from animals and the main direction of human evolution from ape.

710
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:27,540
This direction of evolution is not, as commonly thought, the increase of our ability to reason

711
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,580
and grasp truth.

712
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:34,420
After all, Drard would say, other animals engage in truth-seeking behaviors as well.

713
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,460
There's echolocation, there's tapping into magnetic fields, there's night vision, these

714
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:41,260
are all truth-seeking activities.

715
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:47,700
But we are the only animals who create gods, who tell stories, who spin up fictions, who

716
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:52,940
would go to war for an abstract conception of honor which can neither taste nor smell

717
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:58,340
nor touch, who would trade food and shelter for pieces of paper, who would die for myths

718
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:02,220
and gods that clearly never even existed.

719
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:04,260
Animals are the sober ones.

720
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,860
We are the nut jobs.

721
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:12,580
What makes us unique for Drard is not our ability to determine truth, but our capacity

722
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:18,100
to believe in lies insofar as others around us do as well.

723
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:22,820
For the modern mind, this is a deeply alien conception of human nature, and it opens a

724
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,420
Pandora's box of questions.

725
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:30,700
What does it mean to protect individual freedom if we, like co-vibrating vile in-strings, are

726
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,820
never truly free to begin with?

727
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:38,980
How can we follow our own authentic desires if every part of our psyche is so helplessly

728
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,020
external in its origin?

729
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,980
How is the democratic process not as arbitrary as the whims of a single dictator if we are

730
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,780
so easily influenced and swayed by the mob?

731
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:52,940
These will have to remain questions for now, wrestled with over the course of the next

732
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:58,940
seven lectures, because memesis presents us a much more pressing and threatening problem

733
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:03,180
in this evolutionary story that we must now turn to.

734
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,620
Everything we've talked about up until this point, what we've discussed so far, are the

735
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:10,060
core psychological faculties that define humanity.

736
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:15,980
And now, let us jump back into Gerard's history to see the unique challenges which this psychology

737
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,980
brings about.

738
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:20,820
We are officially moving from psychology to history.

739
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:24,700
As early humans evolved to be more and more memetic, the simple dominance hierarchies

740
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,820
that were able to contain animal groups started breaking down.

741
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:30,060
The idea is to go something like this.

742
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:34,180
Dominance hierarchies, where there's a clear chain of alpha to beta to gamma all the way

743
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:37,540
to omega, works fine if there's little memesis.

744
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:41,720
Even so far as the beta doesn't desire what the alpha has, and the gamma doesn't desire

745
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,540
what the beta has, then all is well.

746
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:49,300
But the memetic tendency of early humans started to become so strong that there started

747
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:54,580
to be frequent cross-pollinization of desires across the hierarchy.

748
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:58,740
Metaphysical desire, at least the strength of it, is unique to humans, and this lets

749
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,780
subjects to enter into rivalry with their models.

750
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:07,940
Converging and competing metaphysical desires would rip social groups apart in wars of all

751
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:13,100
against all, destroying all those societies that were involved.

752
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:18,740
Gerard reasons that the only hominoid groups that survived and formed lasting cultures

753
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:25,020
were ones that stumbled upon a unique cultural technology to stop this escalating conflict,

754
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:29,100
and that he called the scapegoat mechanism.

755
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:34,100
In the midst of such a war of all against all, I think a civil war, a French revolution,

756
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:39,660
when society is an utter chaos, society's Gerard observes often converge upon a single

757
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:45,460
victim or a small set of victims, attributing to them all the blame and frustrations of

758
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,020
the chaos that they're in.

759
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:54,460
Now is this like a rational process, similar to the way that a jury sentences a victim?

760
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,900
Or what should I have in mind here?

761
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:02,100
Yeah, it's not a rational process, it's not a committee that, say, picks the victim,

762
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:06,700
but a somewhat random process, where certain accusations against certain people just start

763
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:11,220
gaining steam until the whole group falls under its spell.

764
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:16,340
Think about the randomness of the French Revolution rather than a calculated drone strike.

765
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:18,940
I think that's what you should have in mind here.

766
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:23,660
This victim, if not fully innocent, certainly does not deserve the extent of the blame

767
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,100
leveled on him.

768
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:29,700
This group is always deceitful, and their certainty is only bolstered by unanimity,

769
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:33,620
the fact that everyone believes in the victim's guilt.

770
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:39,100
This victim will be expelled, often murdered, very brutally, as the group gains a cathartic

771
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,860
release and peace is restored.

772
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:48,060
There are, unfortunately, too many examples of innocent scapegoats throughout human history.

773
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:51,620
Think about Socrates' trial and death at the hands of the Athenian jury.

774
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:55,380
Think about the Black Death, which was blamed on witches and witchcraft.

775
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,940
Think about the Nazis scapegoating the Jews for German decline.

776
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:04,700
Think about McCarthy-era witch hunts, persecuting innocents under the crimes of communism.

777
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:09,180
It's not enough, Gerard reasons, for us to find guilty parties, but we want to find one

778
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:13,700
radical source of evil to blame everything upon.

779
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:18,900
With the scapegoat mechanism, Gerard is highlighting the perennial need of human societies in times

780
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,980
of chaos to identify a single source to blame and murder.

781
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:30,100
To truly establish a peaceful society in a time of turmoil, this murder must be maximally

782
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:37,900
cathartic and as a result, has to be maximally violent and deceitful, often blaming a singular

783
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:42,860
victim for the entirety of the society's problems.

784
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:47,300
Gerard thinks that this murder is wrong, that it's based on a lie, that it's regrettable,

785
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:52,860
that it should not be done, but it worked, and it was the only thing that worked, which

786
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:56,100
kept early human societies alive.

787
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:00,140
To make sense of Gerard's claim here, because this is quite a radical claim on the violent

788
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:06,380
foundations of society, we must go back and think about Gerard's psychology.

789
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:11,140
For every social philosophy, I would wager, that we must ask who the subject is.

790
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:13,020
For Marx, the subject is class.

791
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:14,900
For fascism, it is the nation state.

792
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,060
For Augustine, it is a Christian soul.

793
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,620
For liberalism, it is a rational agent.

794
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:25,620
Gerard's subject of his social philosophy is the spirited animal.

795
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:31,060
Not one who thinks in terms of utility in numbers, but vengeance and pride, honor and

796
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:34,980
being, who experiences envy and resentment.

797
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:41,380
Now, for such a social creature, the primary mechanisms that govern him isn't consensus.

798
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:43,020
It's not the mandate of heaven.

799
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:44,180
It's not the common good.

800
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:48,260
It's certainly not rational political discourse.

801
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:54,100
For Gerard, we aren't rational agents interested in a systematic analysis and nuanced solution,

802
00:55:54,100 --> 00:56:00,140
but social spirited creatures needing a cathartic release against their radical evil.

803
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:06,420
In moments of extreme turbulence, we are interested in truth, but a grand lie and founding murder

804
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,980
that can grant us catharsis.

805
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,900
The lie, however, goes even further.

806
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:15,220
While this no longer happens in modernity for reasons that we'll have to explore a

807
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:21,180
bit later on, in early pagan societies, the peace that descended onto the crowd would

808
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:27,420
be so miraculous, so instantaneous and unbelievable that people would struggle to make sense of

809
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,100
what had just happened.

810
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:33,900
How did we go from being at each other's throats to being fully reconciled?

811
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:39,740
And so, just as deceitfully as the crowd would blame the victim for causing chaos, they now

812
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:46,660
deceitfully praise the now dead victim for ending the chaos, turning the victim paradoxically

813
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,660
into a god.

814
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:51,980
Gerard's point is that the scapegoat mechanism is such a unanimous process.

815
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:56,980
People feel so justified in their expulsion that they don't even feel their own agency.

816
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,300
And so, they don't see themselves as bringing peace.

817
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:04,860
All they have in view is the victim and reasons that it must be the victim that has brought

818
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:05,960
us that peace.

819
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,620
The victim must be a god.

820
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:14,380
These pagan gods are all powerful, with the power to begin and end destruction.

821
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:18,540
These gods are seen as both good and evil.

822
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:23,180
The example Gerard will point to is the story of Oedipus, as told by Sophocles.

823
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,980
Now, we're going to spend an entire lecture with Oedipus, but let me give you a very,

824
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,820
very brief outline first.

825
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:34,060
And Oedipus is a new king of thebes that is being ravaged by a plague.

826
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:39,940
Oedipus is guilty of having committed both patricide, killing of one's father, as well

827
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,540
as incest, of having sex with one's mother.

828
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:49,180
Because of this, the entire city blames Oedipus for causing the plague and expels him.

829
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:53,300
The people get their catharsis and the plague goes away.

830
00:57:53,300 --> 00:58:00,380
Oedipus wanders the Greek states, and as time progresses, something very, very strange happens.

831
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:05,380
Rather than only being an object of scorn that everyone wants to expel to distance from,

832
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:08,900
people are now competing to invite Oedipus into their lands.

833
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:15,660
See a prophecy has gained momentum in Greece, that wherever Oedipus's remains will be buried,

834
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,380
shall be granted lasting peace.

835
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:22,500
And in this Oedipus myth, then, we see both movements of the scapegoat mechanism.

836
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,500
Right?

837
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:24,500
First, we see the scapegoating.

838
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:29,220
Oedipus might have been morally bankrupt for patricide and incest, but it was certainly

839
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:33,060
an exaggerated lie to think that he was the cause of the entire plague, right?

840
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:36,300
His expulsion was a groundless lie.

841
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:40,300
Second, we see the movement of divinization.

842
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:44,860
As Oedipus's expulsion brought about lasting peace through catharsis, he started to gain

843
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:51,340
a dual character, still evil for causing the plague, but also radically good with the power

844
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,100
to end plagues and bring peace.

845
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:59,180
Oedipus, at the end of the story, has been divinized, or at least fetishized.

846
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:04,700
Gerard's claim is that in all pagan religions, we can find traces of a once-victim-turned-god

847
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:06,900
at the foundation of the culture.

848
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:11,340
We will investigate, in due course, across this entire lecture series, the Nordic myth

849
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:16,220
of Baldur's death that resembles a collective expulsion, the Greek myth of the birth of

850
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:21,980
Zeus and its eerie similarities to murder, and the Hindu hymn to Purusha, where a Genesis

851
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:27,700
deity is sacrificed with his remains giving birth to Hindu society and its caste.

852
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:31,940
It's not just religions, however, that are born from the scapegoat mechanism, but pagan

853
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,660
culture and society as well.

854
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:40,220
Take the example of Julius Caesar, who is the victim-turned-god of the Roman Imperium.

855
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:45,420
In the story of Caesar, we also find the key movements of the scapegoat mechanism.

856
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:49,940
First, Roman society is in a state of utter chaos and civil war.

857
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:56,460
Julius Caesar is famously scapegoated, blamed, and collectively murdered on the Senate floor.

858
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:01,660
Zeus does not come immediately to Rome indeed, but it does come at the hand of another Caesar,

859
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:04,860
Caesar Augustus, Julius' nephew.

860
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:11,140
And so with Augustus' victory, Julius Caesar is literally deified, recognized as a literal

861
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:17,100
god by the Roman Senate, and becomes a fountainhead of Roman legitimacy and prestige.

862
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:23,380
From then on, rulers derive their legitimacy from their relationship to Caesar, often explicitly,

863
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:26,060
by bearing their name, calling themselves Caesars.

864
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:30,300
That's why there are so many Caesars in the history of leaders.

865
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:35,380
The victim-turned-god, captured through myth for Gerard, is what lies at the heart of pagan

866
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,260
religion and society.

867
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:41,140
But of course, we need much more than stories to run a society and keep the peace.

868
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:47,300
So out of these myths and founding murders, two sets of real institutions were derived,

869
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,340
prohibitions and rituals.

870
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:53,500
The logic of prohibitions is to prevent chaos from erupting by creating social difference

871
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:57,980
between people so that metaphysical desire does not spread as easily.

872
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:02,980
Caste systems, gender roles, guild lineages, however oppressive, these served a crucial

873
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:07,300
function in pagan society to keep people from competing with each other.

874
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:12,660
Now, when prohibitions failed, another set of institutions must be used, and these are

875
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:13,660
rituals.

876
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:18,460
Rituals aim to enact the founding murder in a constrained way to generate a dissimilar

877
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:22,140
level of catharsis as the founding murder did.

878
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:27,420
Ritual incests, debauchers festivals, human sacrifice, however cruel, these institutions

879
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:32,220
also served a crucial function in pagan society to generate catharsis in order to keep the

880
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:33,220
peace.

881
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,900
They are a release valve.

882
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:41,780
To summarize then, the scapegoat mechanism proceeds from a real cataclysmic event where

883
01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:47,300
a troubled society murders an innocent victim, gains cathartic release, and receives a set

884
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,940
of new gods.

885
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:54,260
This real event is dramatized and captured in myth and then translated back into real

886
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:57,820
institutions in the form of prohibitions and rituals.

887
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:03,980
This arc, going from real event to myth to real institutions, is not only how pagan gods

888
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:09,660
and religions have been made, but also how all human societies and cultures are founded.

889
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:15,700
Now, of course, these societies and myths are based on lies through and through, both

890
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:21,180
the scapegoating and the deification are equally deceitful, because the victim neither has

891
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,300
the power to cause or end the chaos.

892
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:29,540
It's all psychological projection by the crowd, grounded on nothing but unanimity.

893
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:34,780
And importantly, this deceitfulness is always occluded by myth, because myth is written

894
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,580
from the perspective of the persecutor.

895
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:43,060
The persecutor writes from a position of the crowd, and from that vantage point, all will

896
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,180
seem real.

897
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:50,580
The blame, the praise, the deification are all deserved and not mere projections.

898
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:55,900
But more importantly, none of this could be revealed, because if they were, then gods

899
01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:00,580
would lose their powers if people realized that it was they themselves who through unanimity

900
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,580
projected the power onto them.

901
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:05,900
It's all deceitful and all arbitrary.

902
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:11,060
This explanation of pagan religion by Gerard then begs an important question.

903
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:13,220
Why is Gerard a Christian?

904
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:18,580
Primafeisha, Christianity perfectly conforms to this logic that he attributed to false

905
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,620
pagan religions, right?

906
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:25,060
There's civil unrest in Jerusalem, where Christ eventually gets crucified.

907
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:28,780
There's obviously Christ's unjust scapegoating and murder on the cross.

908
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:31,420
There's the resurrection and divinization.

909
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:34,340
There's the mythologization through the Bible.

910
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:38,500
And then there's the institutionalization through the Catholic Church and many of its

911
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,140
prohibitions and rituals.

912
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:45,220
The question is this, how can the Christian story be true for Gerard, but the pagan religions

913
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,420
be false?

914
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:51,860
Gerard's answer is that the Christian story is indeed going to have the same structure

915
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:55,500
as pagan religion, because Christ is going to be scapegoated.

916
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,060
But there's one crucial difference.

917
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:04,860
Christianity will be the first story told from the perspective of the victim.

918
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:08,180
Remember, pagan myth always sides with the murderers.

919
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,820
It always believes in the guilt of its victims.

920
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:15,660
Sophocles' telling of Oedipus affirms the judgment of Thebes that Oedipus was indeed

921
01:04:15,660 --> 01:04:19,460
responsible for the plague because of his patricide and incest.

922
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:25,140
Or take the founding murder of the Roman Republic, that of Romulus and Remus, where Romulus kills

923
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,820
Remus to establish Rome.

924
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:33,340
The canonical telling here, again, paints the killing as, however regrettable, as justified

925
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:40,060
by Remus' hubris and transgression from ignoring Romulus' city's boundaries.

926
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:45,300
What the Bible is doing, then, is to tell the same type of story as pagan religion,

927
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,580
but from the other perspective.

928
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:52,580
Not the perspective of the persecutor, which all pagan religion has been told from, but

929
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:53,580
the victim.

930
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:56,340
I mean, think about it, what does the Bible tell us?

931
01:04:56,340 --> 01:05:01,580
He tells us that Christ is not guilty, even his sentencer, Pontius Pilate, declares his

932
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:02,580
innocence.

933
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:07,060
A mob that convicts Christ is shown to be arbitrary, the true source of evil.

934
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:11,860
The sentencing of Christ is depicted as unjust through and through, with the charges against

935
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:15,860
Christ nothing more than psychological projections by the crowd.

936
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,700
This is what that story tells us.

937
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:23,140
And of course, the whole story is written down and told to us by the disciples, the

938
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:26,380
side of the victim and not the persecutor.

939
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:31,340
Christianity tells the story of scapegoating, but from the opposite, truthful side.

940
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:37,180
We are like jurors who have been hearing the criminals' lies for so long in pagan religion,

941
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:41,460
suddenly exposed to the truth of the victim's testimony.

942
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:44,700
The crucifixion exposes the lies of all religions.

943
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:50,940
To show that, the mob is deceitful, the victim is innocent, there is no sacred pagan power

944
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:52,700
that is merely projection.

945
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:59,180
This is the fundamental, resounding message that comes out of the crucifixion for Gerard.

946
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:05,380
And it is a message that will expose and begin to tear down the scapegoat mechanism, slowly

947
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:06,820
but surely.

948
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:11,700
From this moment on, we will be reading myths in the light of the Gospels, which allows

949
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:14,420
us to see through their lies.

950
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:19,700
Christ's innocence and unjust persecution through the proliferation of Christianity becomes

951
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:23,540
the dominant lens through which we will view the world from then on.

952
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:26,420
We will always be looking out for unjust persecution.

953
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:28,820
We will always be siding with the victim.

954
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:32,100
We will always be aware of the deceitfulness of the mob.

955
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:37,300
Christ knows that reason alone that an analytical articulation of the scapegoat mechanism like

956
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:43,140
the one I just provided you is not enough to shake societies out of this perennial cultural

957
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:44,140
practice.

958
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:50,060
What we need is an equally compelling story that shakes us into a radically new mode of

959
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:52,460
seeing the world.

960
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:57,660
To your point, I'm always surprised by how much of our secular world is grounded on

961
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:58,980
Christian concepts.

962
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:04,660
I think of the Protestant work ethic, our concern for victims, human rights, you know?

963
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:05,660
Yeah.

964
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:08,380
And this is how powerful the Christian story is.

965
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:13,860
We are all, in a sense, living in a Christian paradigm, even if we're not explicitly Christians,

966
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:20,660
because Christianity grounds the fundamental philosophical intuitions of modernity.

967
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:25,340
Christianity then for Gerard is the religion to end all religions, the myth to end all

968
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:32,180
myths, the founding murder to end all founding murders by exposing their violent, unjust,

969
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:34,020
and deceitful origins.

970
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:38,660
The right metaphor to think about Christianity and pagan religion then is the relationship

971
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:41,580
between a vaccine and the original disease.

972
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:46,780
The efficacy of a vaccine to neutralize the original disease lies in its proximity, not

973
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:48,460
its radical difference, right?

974
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:52,580
The structurally, the COVID vaccine is very similar to the original COVID disease, just

975
01:07:52,620 --> 01:07:57,540
with a few tweaks, and it's that similarity is what makes it an effective COVID vaccine

976
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:00,980
and not like a polio vaccine, for example.

977
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:04,780
The Bible then for Gerard is a myth vaccine.

978
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:09,860
And so the strategy of many modern Christians to show that the Bible has nothing to do with

979
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:13,340
the myths of your, that it is radically different, is misguided.

980
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:18,740
I mean, take the epic of Gilgamesh, one of the first known myths of Mesopotamia.

981
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:23,660
Modern Christians blush at the similarities between this myth and the Bible, right?

982
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:28,100
There's a quest for a fruit of immortality from the tree of eternal life.

983
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:32,940
These are things that both exist in the Bible as well as the myth of Gilgamesh.

984
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:37,540
There's a deceitful snake eating a fruit and robbing us of our immortality.

985
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:41,980
And there's also great floods from which the chosen are protected.

986
01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:47,100
Gerard would say, look, don't blush and don't try to distance the Bible from these myths.

987
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:52,980
The Bible is effective because and not despite of its proximity to myths.

988
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:57,940
The Bible is a Trojan horse that frees us from pagan religion from within.

989
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:06,060
Gerard's surprising conclusion is that Christianity is a demystifying force here to end all religions.

990
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:12,020
The Christian moral paradigm takes away the core foundational bedrock of all early human

991
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,020
societies.

992
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:19,020
Slowly but surely, Christianity allows us to decode and escape from the scapegoat mechanism,

993
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,780
which cannot function if people know that the victim is innocent.

994
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:25,740
If the victim is shown to be innocent, then catharsis cannot be achieved.

995
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:27,420
Without catharsis, there's no peace.

996
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,380
Without peace, there's no deification.

997
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:34,380
Without deification, pagan worldly institutions lose their prestige and without prestige,

998
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:37,460
they can no longer properly function.

999
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:42,940
Christianity takes humanity out of cyclical time, demarcated by these relativistic moral

1000
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:48,020
paradigm shifts and accelerates us towards a linear trajectory.

1001
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:55,340
Now the direction of this linearity is defined by four key forces that Christ lets loose

1002
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:56,860
on human history.

1003
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:03,900
Love, truth, innovation, and surprisingly, Gerard thinks violence.

1004
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:08,500
As with all things Gerard, even his analysis on the worldly effects of Christianity are

1005
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,420
deeply ambivalent.

1006
01:10:10,420 --> 01:10:15,300
Within this Pandora's box of forces that Christ has just let loose on human history,

1007
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:21,380
we have the good, love, truth, innovation, but also the apocalyptic violence.

1008
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:25,980
They are both growing and have broken free all at the same time.

1009
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:33,420
What's more, even within these individual forces, Gerard's analysis is deeply ambivalent.

1010
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:36,780
Love often manifests as hypocrisy.

1011
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:42,300
Truth becomes dogma, and innovation degenerates into fashion.

1012
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:49,100
And even in violence, Gerard sees a key motivational force that has brought forth the most enviable

1013
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:53,460
living conditions of man when channeled productively through capitalism.

1014
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:56,580
Let's examine each of these forces in turn.

1015
01:10:56,580 --> 01:11:01,300
The first force that Christianity unleashes on history is love.

1016
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:05,460
Love is the force that has made all of our institutions like law so much more humane.

1017
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:11,580
It's the force that sees developed nations competing for the prestige of helping troubled

1018
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:12,580
nations.

1019
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:17,500
It's the force that has freed us from cruel practices of human sacrifice and bloody rituals.

1020
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:23,100
It's the force underpinning the modern political ideals of human rights and equality.

1021
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:28,060
Gerard believes that Christ is responsible for all of this because that was his key message.

1022
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:34,140
Renounce violence, turn the other cheek, develop love, love thy neighbor as thyself.

1023
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:39,140
We are so concerned with the poor and the dispossessed these days, we naturally side

1024
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:44,620
with victims in the same way that pagan societies might have sided with the strong because Christ's

1025
01:11:44,620 --> 01:11:49,460
story is about the innocence and the moral purity of victims.

1026
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:54,060
Culturally, we are radically different from pagan society with their worship of power

1027
01:11:54,060 --> 01:12:01,180
and disregard for the weak, but in some sense, stubborn human nature still refuses to budge.

1028
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:05,660
Gerard thinks we still need to persecute, but the only acceptable way to persecute is

1029
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:10,540
now in the name of victims, in the name of stopping persecution.

1030
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:14,540
In a way then, Gerard isn't convinced society has really changed that much at all that we've

1031
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,780
really given up persecution.

1032
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:22,040
Rather, perhaps the better reading is that it's a mere superficial switch of who we

1033
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:25,300
think it's acceptable to persecute.

1034
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:29,860
Because of our victim-concerned culture, anyone who looks like a traditional victim is completely

1035
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:34,620
off limits, ethnic minorities, the lower classes, women, the disabled, and Gerard thinks that's

1036
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,100
a great thing.

1037
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:39,100
But the problem is that we've flipped it on its head.

1038
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:44,620
Now we feel warranted, nay, maybe even compelled to persecute all types of privilege, white

1039
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:49,060
privilege, ableist privilege, class privilege, male privilege.

1040
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:55,400
Gerard has this to say, I'll give you a quote, our society's obligatory compassion authorizes

1041
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,980
new forms of cruelty.

1042
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:04,700
Gerard accuses modernity of hypocrisy, and he reminds us of the terrible atrocities

1043
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:07,540
committed in the name of protecting victims.

1044
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:10,220
Let me give you another quote.

1045
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:13,840
Hypocrisy is dangerous then because it leads to what it claims to prevent, the persecution

1046
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,340
of victims.

1047
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:19,180
Anyone familiar with the tragedies of the Soviet Union grounded on protection of the

1048
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:26,020
victimized proletariat should look at America's caught up in victimhood ideology with trembling

1049
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,020
fear.

1050
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:28,880
This is other totalitarianism.

1051
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,740
This inquisition in the name of victims is the form that arbitrary unjustified violence

1052
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:37,860
takes place today, the persecution of persecutors.

1053
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:38,860
End quote.

1054
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:41,140
Now, that's love.

1055
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:48,460
And the same ambivalent story could be told for the second force of Christianity, truth.

1056
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:54,460
Gerard asks us to look around in the modern world, more so than any almost other civilization.

1057
01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:58,900
We value truth and believe in our ability to obtain it.

1058
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:03,700
Far are we from the garden of Eden's prohibitions against the tree of knowledge.

1059
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:06,980
Far are we from the intellectual humilities of Job.

1060
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:11,020
Far are we from the lessons from Oedipus that knowing more can lead to disaster.

1061
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:14,660
And far are we from witch hunts and superstitions.

1062
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:20,900
Perhaps unsurprisingly at this point, Gerard takes the crowning achievement of truth, science,

1063
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:23,580
to be engendered by Christianity.

1064
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:28,140
This might seem ridiculous, but let me give you a first pass at his argument.

1065
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:33,140
Christianity paved the way for scientific inquiry by expelling myth and clearing the

1066
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:35,100
ground as it were.

1067
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:38,260
This should already be a familiar idea at this point.

1068
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:44,540
Christianity exposes the deceitfulness of worldly foundations and begins to tear down prohibitions,

1069
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:46,740
rituals, and all pagan religions.

1070
01:14:46,740 --> 01:14:52,500
And it's only when we cease to look for truth in myth does reason even have the fertile

1071
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:56,420
ground to bear the fruits of truth.

1072
01:14:56,420 --> 01:15:00,820
After all, if something is already explained by a wildly prestigious myth that is fatal

1073
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:05,020
to question, then reason will not even want to begin to investigate it.

1074
01:15:05,020 --> 01:15:08,860
Gerard's interlocutor sums up his view quite nicely here.

1075
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:09,860
Let me quote again.

1076
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:16,300
It is really Christianity that makes science possible by desacralizing the real, by freeing

1077
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:19,180
people from magical causalities.

1078
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:24,340
Once we stop seeing storms as being triggered by the machinations of the witch across the

1079
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:30,540
street, we start being able to study meteorological phenomenon scientifically.

1080
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:35,620
Now, I need to say a lot more and I will to convince you of this point, but before we

1081
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:40,780
celebrate too early, the same problem with love occurs with truth.

1082
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:46,060
Just as the protection of victims is the banner which persecutors rally under, we love science

1083
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:51,660
so much that we have fetishized it into an unquestionable religion.

1084
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:56,780
But what's the problem with science gaining an immense prestige?

1085
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:58,620
What's wrong with that?

1086
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,340
Gerard's answer is this.

1087
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:07,620
By being deified, science can become unquestionable, which can silence opposing voices and justify

1088
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,700
terrible political agendas.

1089
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:12,300
Think about Malthus in the 18th century.

1090
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:16,540
The reason that living standards will go back to subsistence is because population growth

1091
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:21,140
grows geometrically while food increases arithmetically.

1092
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:27,300
In the 1970s, there was a whole wave of ridiculous climate science championed by the Times, the

1093
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:29,980
New York Review, Columbia Brown.

1094
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:34,860
They were publishing articles about an inevitable ice age that just seems ludicrous from today's

1095
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:35,860
perspective.

1096
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:41,540
And of course, the terrors of the Nazis were justified on the latest science of the day,

1097
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:42,940
eugenics.

1098
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:48,620
Far from a pseudoscience, eugenics enjoyed enormous prestige in the early 20th century.

1099
01:16:48,620 --> 01:16:54,220
It was grounded on Darwin, the latest evolutionary biology of the day, and responsible for the

1100
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:56,460
development of statistics.

1101
01:16:56,460 --> 01:17:01,460
There was a University College London chair of eugenics in the same way there might be

1102
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:03,580
a chair for biology today.

1103
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:08,020
And eugenics was supported by Nobel laureates like Hermann Mueller and political leaders

1104
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:10,100
like Theodore Roosevelt.

1105
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:14,020
So I hope the problem of deifying science is clear.

1106
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:18,260
George thinks the reason that it is dangerous to deify science is the same reason it was

1107
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:21,820
dangerous to deify edicts of the Catholic Church.

1108
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:27,860
Just as the bloody European conquest of the Americas was, at least partially, legitimized

1109
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:33,620
through the appeal to Catholicism as spreading the gospel, today we too legitimize our often

1110
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:40,260
questionable political pursuits with just a sprinkle of reason, a little dab of science.

1111
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:44,660
And just as whomever used to disagree with the Catholic Church, we called heretics.

1112
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:50,900
We call those today who disagree with politically-charged, questionable science as anti-science, someone

1113
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:54,620
whose positions we don't even have to contend with.

1114
01:17:54,620 --> 01:18:00,780
When deified, science becomes a blocker to truth and genuine inquiry, because it becomes

1115
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:02,780
a conversation stopper.

1116
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:05,660
Therein lies the hypocrisy.

1117
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:11,540
Now, the third force of Christianity is innovation, and it has been engendered by Christ in a

1118
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:14,500
very similar way that science was.

1119
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:20,380
By tearing down myths, we are freed from an exaggerated adulation of the past, and we

1120
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:24,740
are enabled and empowered to imagine its future.

1121
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:29,180
The idea that Gerard has in mind here might be better approximated by thinking about the

1122
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:30,420
negative case.

1123
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:35,740
What is certainly not conducive to innovation is the reactionary idea, not uncommon throughout

1124
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:41,100
most history, most famously perhaps among the Confucians and perhaps many Christians

1125
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:44,020
that our best days are behind us.

1126
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:50,340
And such a view lends to the practical orientation that the best we can do is to blindly imitate

1127
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:55,340
the past and press the brakes on the downward trajectory of history.

1128
01:18:55,340 --> 01:19:01,180
Under such a worldview, the very word innovation had negative connotations in the West, up

1129
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:03,260
until the 18th century.

1130
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:09,100
Its connotations were negative because innovation implied a deviation from a sacred, albeit static

1131
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:13,500
and rigid ideal, provided to us by the myths of yore.

1132
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:17,420
Innovation before the 18th century was synonymous with heresy.

1133
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:23,060
Now, such an exaggerated respect of the past is often grounded on a religious belief in

1134
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:25,060
a mythologized past.

1135
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:30,140
Christianity frees us from this blind worship because it is a force, according to Gerard,

1136
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:34,460
of course, that tears down mythologization.

1137
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:39,380
It reveals to us what we once thought of as immutable, as arbitrary, so we are free to

1138
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,740
experiment and innovate.

1139
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:48,660
One of the surprising things that I've seen is this weird anti-correlation between mythologizing

1140
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,740
the past and innovation.

1141
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:55,020
I started to get this hunch when I would spend time around Silicon Valley types and

1142
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:59,820
you have dinner with them and they boast about their knowledge of the world.

1143
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:04,220
But then you start talking to them about the history of their own industry and it's not

1144
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:07,940
something that they think or talk about a lot.

1145
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:12,180
I compare that to the people I've met in the oil industry or the finance industry, these

1146
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:16,620
older and more established industries, where the people who I meet there, they know the

1147
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:19,020
history of their industries cold.

1148
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,020
You know what I mean?

1149
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:24,860
That's a very interesting observation that there is a negative correlation between how

1150
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:30,380
innovative an industry or a person is against how much they know about history or at least

1151
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:31,860
seem to respect it.

1152
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:36,620
I think Gerard would say that the difference between the tech industry and the oil industry

1153
01:20:36,620 --> 01:20:43,340
is the same difference between modernity and pagan society, that we are much less idolatrous

1154
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:47,940
and concerned with the past and as a result much more oriented towards the future due

1155
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:49,940
to Christianity.

1156
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:56,300
Now, as we are freed from the grips of the past, innovation has brought about drastic

1157
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:57,860
technological and social change.

1158
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:01,620
Clearly, if you just look around our world, there's the mastery of travel and land, air

1159
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:02,620
and sea.

1160
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:07,420
There's the victory over disease and starvation, the political systems, gender norms, money,

1161
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:13,580
Western civilization, at least in the past few hundred years, is defined by and prides

1162
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:15,380
itself with change.

1163
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:20,580
The problem with innovation is the same problem with love and truth, hypocrisy.

1164
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:22,860
We've now fetishized innovation.

1165
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:25,160
We are conforming to contrarianism.

1166
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:29,140
We are obediently rallying under the banner of originality.

1167
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:33,060
Gerard has this to say, it's so good that I'll quote it in full.

1168
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:37,780
The modern world rejects imitation in favor of originality at all costs.

1169
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:40,740
You should never say what others are saying, never paint what others are painting, never

1170
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:43,300
think what others are thinking and so on.

1171
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:50,140
Since this is absolutely impossible, there soon emerges a negative imitation that sterilizes

1172
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:51,140
everything.

1173
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:57,100
More and more, often they're obliged to turn their coats inside out and with great fanfare

1174
01:21:57,100 --> 01:22:02,780
announce some new epistemological rupture that is supposed to revolutionize the field

1175
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:04,460
from top to bottom.

1176
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:09,780
This rage for originality has produced a few rare masterpieces and quite a few rather

1177
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:11,100
bizarre things.

1178
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:15,380
The principle of originality at all costs leads to paralysis.

1179
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:21,500
The more we celebrate creative and enriching innovations, the fewer of them there are.

1180
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:27,100
For 2,000 years, the arts have been imitative and it's only in the 19th and 20th century

1181
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:29,980
that people started refusing to be mimetic.

1182
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:31,220
Why?

1183
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:33,660
Because we're more mimetic than ever.

1184
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:40,580
Rivalry plays a role such that we strive vainly to exercise imitation.

1185
01:22:40,580 --> 01:22:45,700
The problem that Gerard is identifying here, with categorically rejecting imitation and

1186
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:52,420
idolizing innovation, is that imitation and meaningful innovation are often inseparable.

1187
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:57,560
You need to imitate and gain mastery first before you can make any real innovations.

1188
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:03,620
History is littered with examples where repetition, replication, imitation is a necessary precondition

1189
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:04,740
for innovation.

1190
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:10,220
Think about Goethe, who was a master of reproduction, reproducing the great poetic forms before

1191
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:11,660
he pioneered his own.

1192
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:17,100
Think about the industrial powers that started off as mere copycats but grew into innovators

1193
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,540
in their own right.

1194
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:21,060
Let me read Gerard again.

1195
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:25,860
It began with Germany, which, in the 19th century, was thought to be at most capable

1196
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:28,000
of imitating English.

1197
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,100
And this, at the precise moment, surpassed them.

1198
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:35,500
It continued with the Americans in whom, for a long time, the Europeans saw mediocre

1199
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:40,660
gadget makers, who weren't theoretical or cerebral enough to take on a world leadership

1200
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:41,660
role.

1201
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:46,140
And it happened once more with the Japanese, who, after World War II, were still seen as

1202
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:49,740
pathetic imitators of Western superiority.

1203
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:51,940
It's starting up again, it seems, with Korea.

1204
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:54,580
And soon, perhaps, it'll be the Chinese.

1205
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:59,260
All of these consecutive mistakes about the creative potential of imitation cannot be

1206
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:00,260
due to chance.

1207
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:01,260
End quote.

1208
01:24:02,140 --> 01:24:07,380
Gerard's point here is that by fetishizing contrarianism, innovation, originality, and

1209
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:14,620
by rejecting repetition, replication, imitation, we paradoxically doom ourselves to never make

1210
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:20,820
any meaningful innovations whatsoever, because innovation is dependent on imitation.

1211
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:29,180
Now, as you can see, even the three quote-unquote good forces of modernity are deeply ambivalent.

1212
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:30,180
Nature's fundamentally changed.

1213
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:34,420
There's never been a society as loving, truthful, and innovative as ours.

1214
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:37,380
But stubborn human nature refuses to budge.

1215
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:41,300
We still need to persecute, to deify, and to conform.

1216
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:47,380
And so, the perversities of modernity for Gerard all take on the shape of hypocrisy,

1217
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:51,980
persecution under the banner of protecting victims, rigid adherence to scientific dogmas

1218
01:24:51,980 --> 01:24:58,140
under the guise of free intellectual exploration, the most derivative of imitations packaged

1219
01:24:58,140 --> 01:25:00,580
as radical innovations.

1220
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:06,340
The metaphor, then, that best captures this radical break as well as stubborn continuity

1221
01:25:06,340 --> 01:25:10,500
is a just-launch rocket struggling to reach escape velocity.

1222
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:12,100
I mean, think about it.

1223
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:16,980
Such a rocket is clearly a radical break from it was stationary.

1224
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:22,260
But it is also in a continuity, because it is still governed by the pull of gravity.

1225
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:27,260
The same, perhaps, can be said for the point of history that we're in now.

1226
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:31,980
There's a clear radical break between our culture that protects victims and all the

1227
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:35,500
ones that have come before, which made them into scapegoats.

1228
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:40,260
But the stubborn gravitational pull of the human condition remains the same.

1229
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:44,260
We still need to persecute and find victims to blame.

1230
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:50,220
It's this tension between cultural advancement and the constancy of human nature that plagues

1231
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:52,260
modernity for Gerard.

1232
01:25:52,260 --> 01:25:58,020
Now, our rocket ship of modernity is already in trouble, but the fourth and final force

1233
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:03,100
of Christianity will send it crashing towards the groundâviolence.

1234
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:07,780
You may be surprised that Gerard conceived of violence as one of the forces coming out

1235
01:26:07,780 --> 01:26:10,860
of Christ's defeating the scapegoat mechanism.

1236
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:15,340
But given Gerard's understanding of how worldly peace is brought about, this conclusion

1237
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:18,700
in some sense should flow quite naturally.

1238
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:23,340
After all, if worldly order, a peaceful society, is founded on a deceitful, violent act of

1239
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:29,300
catharsis, then truth and love, which Christianity has unleashed, must be threatening if not

1240
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:31,620
harmful for this foundation.

1241
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:36,300
The scapegoat mechanism is a deeply morally ambivalent process for Gerard.

1242
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:41,460
It is deceitful, it is wrong, but it's also so damn effective.

1243
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:46,780
Just a single, innocent man has to be murdered for the entire community to be saved.

1244
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:50,900
Christ's one, for the peace of all, limits the freedom of the parts for the stability

1245
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:52,300
of the whole.

1246
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:57,460
And so, we might say, in a highly reductive fashion, that the scapegoat mechanism is a

1247
01:26:57,460 --> 01:27:03,540
worldly good, but ultimate evil, whereas Christ is ultimately good, but brings forth worldly

1248
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:04,540
destruction.

1249
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:11,380
Gerard constantly reminds us that Christ himself says as much, Matthew 10.34, Christ

1250
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:13,380
has this to say.

1251
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:21,500
If not that I am come to send peace on earth, I came not to send peace, but a sword.

1252
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:26,740
Christ's sword is aimed at the scapegoat mechanism, which lies at the foundation of

1253
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:27,940
worldly order.

1254
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:33,940
Now, while the consequences of the Christian revelation for Gerard are violent and destructive,

1255
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:36,540
Christ's intentions surely are not.

1256
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:40,580
Christ did not cut down the worldly order for the sake of cutting down worldly order,

1257
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:46,860
but only so we may be freed from violence and lies, such that we can love each other.

1258
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:52,540
Christ took off our training wheels so that we may be freed, yet we've simply fallen

1259
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,660
and stumbled.

1260
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:59,700
Without the scapegoat mechanism, we no longer have our old prohibitions to stop metaphysical

1261
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:05,140
desires from running rampant, nor do we have sacrificial rituals to bring about catharsis.

1262
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:10,700
So to put it in other words, we've lost both our tools to prevent and resolve violence.

1263
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:13,020
So why haven't we gone bust yet?

1264
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:17,180
After all, the world looks pretty peaceful to me.

1265
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:23,380
Gerard responds, don't confuse the lack of the actuality of violence with the lack of

1266
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:25,740
the potential for violence.

1267
01:28:25,740 --> 01:28:30,180
Violent energies have been building up and increasing, but they've been contained and

1268
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:36,460
productively channeled for now, by two new institutions of modernity.

1269
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:38,820
The first institution is capitalism.

1270
01:28:38,820 --> 01:28:43,060
Capitalism is the channel that absorbs and productively directs violence.

1271
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:47,380
Let me be clear that when Gerard says that capitalism is a channel for violence, he

1272
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:53,620
doesn't have in mind whipping slaves to build the pyramids, but that the same violent, competitive

1273
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:59,380
energies of glory, of pride, of desire for conquest are the dominant ones driving capitalism

1274
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:00,620
today.

1275
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:07,220
Gerard reminds us, I quote, it is not by chance that the European aristocracy went into business

1276
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:11,140
once heroes and warriors went out of style, end quote.

1277
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:16,700
Gerard's point is that when we peek behind the motivational curtains of actors and capitalism,

1278
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:19,500
we shouldn't expect to find a desire to help others.

1279
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:23,980
We shouldn't even expect to find a materialistic greed, instead what people are really after

1280
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:28,940
are the same social goods, recognition, honor, prestige, glory.

1281
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:34,100
The princes and heroes of yore who would have amassed armies now find themselves competing

1282
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:36,700
to make products and services.

1283
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:42,420
Gerard warns us such, don't be fooled by the altruistic aims that capitalistic actors

1284
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:44,380
so desperately advertise.

1285
01:29:44,380 --> 01:29:48,580
It's the same drive that drove Achilles to kill Hector, that drove Germany to invade

1286
01:29:48,580 --> 01:29:55,180
France, that drove Caesar to capture Vercingetorix, that underpins our world economy today.

1287
01:29:55,180 --> 01:30:00,300
It's funny, you're referencing ancient stories there, but even today, I'll look at my friends

1288
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:06,420
who are successful entrepreneurs and a shocking percentage of them were criminals in high school.

1289
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:06,940
Right.

1290
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:14,420
And I think that the same energy that drove them to be criminals, what capitalism does,

1291
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:18,380
is it redirects that energy towards entrepreneurship.

1292
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:24,100
Yeah, and I think this is both a deep critique of capital, right, that it's fundamentally

1293
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:30,940
driven off these spirited irrational forces, but also a depraise of capitalism, right?

1294
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:35,980
What a miracle it is today that people who seek revenge, who seek glory, who seek domination,

1295
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:42,100
who seek an outlet for their criminal energies have to do so, not by killing millions in

1296
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:48,180
zero-sum wars as people have done for thousands of years, but they have to compete in making

1297
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:51,060
better in products and services for others.

1298
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:55,940
What a miracle Gerard's analysis on capitalism is deeply ambivalent.

1299
01:30:55,940 --> 01:31:00,700
Now, capitalism can only properly function in this way.

1300
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:06,700
When it is supported by law, law is the second important institution of modernity that contains

1301
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,140
violence.

1302
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:14,740
For Gerard, law only works in situations where there's an entity with a monopoly over violence

1303
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:17,980
that can arbitrate between disputing parties.

1304
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:24,020
Law does not bring about peace through catharsis, nor the edicts of law justified on the prestige

1305
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,340
of some deity.

1306
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:29,940
It keeps peace by threatening with you with more violence.

1307
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:36,360
If you, the injured party, aren't satisfied with the outcome of a trial and seek private

1308
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:41,480
vengeance by killing or hurting the criminal who injured you, then the state will come

1309
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:44,460
after you and punish you with more violence.

1310
01:31:44,460 --> 01:31:49,700
Law only functions when there is such a powerful entity with a monopoly over violence that

1311
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:52,980
can easily overpower disputing parties.

1312
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:56,140
That's where its efficacy stems from.

1313
01:31:56,140 --> 01:32:02,680
This is why within a single nation, laws are often inviolable and sacrosanct, yet between

1314
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,180
nations, right?

1315
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:08,340
Think the laws of the UN or the Geneva Convention.

1316
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:14,740
These laws without an entity, without a monopoly over violence, are so often transgressed with

1317
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:16,780
little consequence.

1318
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:22,200
For Gerard, capitalism is this bubbling stew of violent competitive energies that must

1319
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:27,180
be contained by law if that violence is not to overflow.

1320
01:32:27,180 --> 01:32:33,800
That is why Gerard thinks the dyke will break where capitalism intersects the weakest points

1321
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:38,440
of law in between nations, in global trade.

1322
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:43,360
Global trade is where national pride and competitive energies are piled up, yet there

1323
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:50,280
is no monopolistic force of violence to arbitrate law between parties.

1324
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:55,900
Under this light, let me read you Gerard's startling predictions 15 years ago once more.

1325
01:32:55,900 --> 01:33:01,360
He said this again at the height of Sino-American optimism, when popular wisdom all believed

1326
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:05,480
that relationships between China and the U.S. would only get better through trade.

1327
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:07,320
I quote to you again,

1328
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:11,160
A conflict between the United States and China will follow.

1329
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,800
Everything is in place.

1330
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:18,660
Though it will not necessarily occur on the military level at first, trade can transform

1331
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:20,720
very quickly into war.

1332
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:25,880
From this point of view, we can reasonably fear a major clash between China and the United

1333
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:28,320
States in the coming decades.

1334
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:32,600
If such a war between colossal nation states were to actually happen, it could very well

1335
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:34,600
be the last war.

1336
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:39,360
With the invention of nuclear weaponry, Gerard thinks we genuinely do live in an apocalyptic

1337
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:44,200
moment where the entire world can go up in flames in mere minutes.

1338
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:48,120
What is unique about the nuke isn't its singular destructive force.

1339
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:52,680
The firebombing of Tokyo, the Mongol mass murders, I think are all comparable to the

1340
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:56,080
devastation of a singular nuclear strike.

1341
01:33:56,080 --> 01:34:01,640
What is unique about the nuke is that it forces rivals to utterly destroy each other at the

1342
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:04,160
first glimpse of provocation.

1343
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:09,000
Unlike firebombing or a Mongol horde that takes time to maneuver through terrain, there

1344
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,160
are no frictions to unleashing your entire nuclear arsenal.

1345
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:18,880
Before the nuke, nations fought wars like a boxing match, taking time to maneuver, resting

1346
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:23,880
in between with fatal blows rare and after taking a very long time.

1347
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:31,440
The nuke allows nation states to fight wars like a duel, an instant and fatal escalation.

1348
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:36,000
In many ways, it's worse than a duel because it allows the dead party to shoot the person

1349
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,480
who is alive.

1350
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:42,720
Even if you nuke my entire landmass into oblivion, my nuclear submarines can still avenge me

1351
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,280
post-mortem.

1352
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:48,920
This is what it means by mutually assured destruction.

1353
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:57,280
Armed in this light, Drard's worries of apocalypse is less theological speculation than deja vu.

1354
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:05,440
On October 27, 1962, a Soviet submarine armed with a nuclear-tipped torpedo was located and

1355
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:12,200
targeted by an American carrier group, dropping a signaling-depth charge like underwater bombs

1356
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:17,520
intended to destroy the submarine at the height of the Cuban missile crisis.

1357
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:22,320
The crew in that submarine had completely lost contact with Moscow for days and thought

1358
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,760
that a new world war had broken out.

1359
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:28,840
They were debating and considering whether to fire the nuke, believing that they were

1360
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:30,960
under direct attack.

1361
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:37,440
This submarine required all three senior officers to agree to launch the strike.

1362
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:40,520
Two of them decided to do so.

1363
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:47,120
Only one officer's stubborn refusal prevented an almost certain nuclear attack and likely

1364
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,560
Armageddon.

1365
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,400
This is how close we were.

1366
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:54,600
The will of one man was all that stood in the way.

1367
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:59,960
With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the specter of apocalypse has long faded from

1368
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:06,720
the public imagination, but Drard prophesies that this ghost of yours will soon return

1369
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:09,040
to haunt us once more.

1370
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:14,160
If the end of the world had a beginning, I think we could do far worse than attributing

1371
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:17,080
it to the invention of the nuclear bomb.

1372
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:20,640
So how ought one live in the end times?

1373
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:23,920
With apocalypse around the corner, what ought one do?

1374
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:27,920
Drard's answer is brief as it is unsatisfying.

1375
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:28,920
Withdraw.

1376
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,400
Withdraw from the world.

1377
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:31,640
Leave it all behind.

1378
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:32,880
Tend to your own garden.

1379
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,080
There's nothing you can do to stop apocalypse.

1380
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:38,440
You're only going to muddy your own moral character by trying to get involved in such

1381
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:39,440
a mess.

1382
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,440
Withdraw.

1383
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:43,920
Stay away from it all so that you can nurture your soul.

1384
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:49,200
The kingdom of God will not be established here on earth, but perhaps we can preserve

1385
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:53,080
ourselves to be worthy of it in heaven.

1386
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:59,560
On November 4th, 2015, Drard passed away peacefully in his home in Stanford, California

1387
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:06,960
at the age of 91, leaving us in deafening silence, stranded in an apocalyptic moment

1388
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:10,200
with nothing but the advice to withdraw.

1389
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:16,020
This is how Drard's story ends and where our lectures will also come to a screeching

1390
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:17,520
halt.

1391
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:22,640
Hopefully, I've given enough reason already to engage with Drard and continue with these

1392
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:23,640
lecture series.

1393
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:28,440
I fear that as time progresses, Drard will prove to be if you'll entertain another

1394
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:34,120
metaphor, a seismograph of history, able to feel the slight tremors that would balloon

1395
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:39,880
to tectonic shifts before others even know that we are standing on a fault line.

1396
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:43,240
Drard begins his final work as such.

1397
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:45,840
This is an apocalyptic book.

1398
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:51,840
It will become more understandable with time because, unquestionably, we are accelerating

1399
01:37:51,840 --> 01:37:56,360
swiftly towards the destruction of the world."

1400
01:37:56,360 --> 01:38:02,360
Unfortunately, his most unlikely prediction of worsening Sino-American relationships has

1401
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:06,280
already been made more understandable with time.

1402
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:11,680
On the topic of apocalypse, I desperately hope Drard is wrong, but I fear that he is

1403
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:13,160
right.

1404
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:17,680
If he is right, then Drard is worth engaging because he is one of the only guys to help

1405
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:23,920
us navigate the end time, one of the few Virgil's left who still take apocalypse literally

1406
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:25,560
and seriously.

1407
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:31,200
However, I would be a deceitful merchant of ideas if I also didn't share with you why

1408
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:35,400
you shouldn't engage with Drard or continue with these lectures.

1409
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:38,040
There's a common metaphor given about philosophy.

1410
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:42,200
Philosophy is often compared with medicine, that it has the power to cure our souls and

1411
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:47,600
societies and I think that's a quite apt metaphor, but just not taken far enough.

1412
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:51,280
Because just as medicine has side effects, so do philosophies.

1413
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:56,200
And I wish that philosophers wrote on the side of their books the unwanted side effects

1414
01:38:56,200 --> 01:39:00,320
of their philosophies as pharmaceutical companies did it on their drugs.

1415
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:05,000
Warning, disdain for the material world if you take too much of these platonic dialogues

1416
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,320
in one sitting.

1417
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:11,160
Caution, more than one dose of Nietzsche a day makes patients with pre-existing health

1418
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:14,320
conditions descend into uncontrollable rage.

1419
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:18,760
Side effect, erectile dysfunction if you take these Buddhist sutras too seriously.

1420
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:25,280
Attention, inability to form coherent sentences if you read too much Adorno in one sitting.

1421
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:30,280
Just as a drug will course through your veins and infiltrate your entire system.

1422
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:35,440
Drard's ideas will latch themselves onto your psyche and colonize your world view.

1423
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:40,640
So we must ask, what are the side effects of engaging Drard?

1424
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:46,320
I've presented to you the red pill, but as any honest merchant I must also tell you why

1425
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,920
you should take the blue pill instead.

1426
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:53,520
The likely but not necessary side effects of Drard are threefold.

1427
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:55,720
First, alienation.

1428
01:39:55,720 --> 01:40:01,360
Drard will likely show your most intimate long-held desires, ones that your entire identity

1429
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:04,960
have been staked on as external and alien.

1430
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:08,480
The career you've always wanted since you were four, the type of person you wanted to

1431
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:12,680
marry since childhood, the political cause that you've dedicated your life to, your

1432
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:19,280
core desires will likely be thoroughly alienated and shown to be external and perhaps even

1433
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:20,560
perverse.

1434
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:23,720
The medic theory could also alienate you from others.

1435
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:28,280
From this point going forward, you will have trouble fully participating in any political

1436
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:34,000
or collective activity, always aware of the deceitfulness of mimesis and the madness of

1437
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
crowds.

1438
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,480
Second, inaction.

1439
01:40:37,480 --> 01:40:41,240
Drard is the most ambivalent writer that I've ever come across.

1440
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:43,400
What should we do with escape going?

1441
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:46,000
Well, on one hand, it's a huge lie.

1442
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,320
You're killing innocents, but on the other, it is the only way that pagan societies have

1443
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:51,320
brought peace.

1444
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:55,200
Should we fight to remove caste systems?

1445
01:40:55,200 --> 01:41:00,480
Well, if you don't, then you will subject people to arbitrary distinction, meaningless

1446
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,800
oppression grounded on nothing but lies.

1447
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:07,400
But if you do, you open them up to competition of all against all.

1448
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:11,760
Metaphysical desire will burn through their communities and set it ablaze.

1449
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,760
Should we participate in capitalism?

1450
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:20,720
Capitalism is a competitive cesspool of violent energies that has brought about the most lovely

1451
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:24,000
prosperous and peaceful society known to date.

1452
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,800
If you are looking for clear-cut answers or even answers at all, you've come knocking

1453
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:28,800
on the wrong door.

1454
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,760
Go to a Marx or Hegel instead.

1455
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:36,840
The extreme ambivalence in all of Drard's ideas, in addition to his deep pessimism on

1456
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:42,800
the human condition and history, tends to incapacitate those who've digested them a

1457
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,520
bit too thoroughly.

1458
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:51,000
Third, and certainly not least, the side effect of Drard is hopelessness.

1459
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,680
By now, the point should be familiar.

1460
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:57,080
Apocalypse is imminent.

1461
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:02,840
There is nothing you, nor I, nor anyone can do about it.

1462
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:09,400
If you do wish to remain hopeful after understanding and digesting Drard, just know that that

1463
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:13,800
hope is going to have to come from you and not Drard.

1464
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:19,520
You are going to have to dig yourself and all of us out of this apocalyptic hole Drard

1465
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:24,800
really has nothing left to offer.

1466
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,280
Turn back while you still can.

1467
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:29,680
I have warned you thus.

1468
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:36,520
Now, to those stubborn or perhaps morbidly curious enough to continue, I can only heed

1469
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:43,640
one last time, against continuing on these lectures, by echoing what Dante inscribed

1470
01:42:43,640 --> 01:42:48,360
on the gates of hell, abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
