1. **Alienation**: Engaging with Drard's ideas might lead to a profound sense of alienation from your former desires and aspirations, as his philosophy could expose these as external and potentially perverse.

2. **Inaction**: Drard often presents ambivalent arguments that can make it difficult to take decisive action. His writing suggests that many social systems are deeply flawed, but also acknowledges the potential negative consequences of attempting to change them. This ambivalence could lead to a state of inaction or paralysis as one grapples with the complexity of these issues.
