Checking Fullstack Academy/Lambda Calculus - Fundamentals of Lambda Calculus & Functional Programming in JavaScript.txt
1. Lambda calculus and combinators are fundamental concepts in functional programming, influencing languages like Miranda, Lisp, and Haskell.
2. The talk aimed to demonstrate the relevance of lambda calculus by showing how it underpins many practical features in modern functional programming languages.
3. Features such as closures, higher-order functions, laziness, infinite data structures, garbage collection, function graph reduction, type theory, parallel processing, and parametric polymorphism all have their origins in lambda calculus.
4. The talk covered the history of lambda calculus, its mathematical beauty, and its practical applications, emphasizing that it's both an art and a science.
5. The Y combinator is a key concept in lambda calculus as it allows for recursion in languages that don't inherently support it, like JavaScript (though a variation called the Z combinator was mentioned for use in JavaScript due to its non-lazy evaluation).
6. The talk provided resources for further exploration of combinators and their applications, including slides with examples of combinators, boolean operations, numerals, and data structures.
7. The speaker hoped that the audience would be inspired to delve deeper into the topic and discover the elegance and utility of lambda calculus and its combinators.
