00:00.000 --> 00:06.560
Hi, and welcome to another philosophy lecture.

00:06.560 --> 00:16.360
This is going to be an interesting one, Willard Van Orman-Quine, on what there is.

00:16.360 --> 00:20.080
Quine was a very influential philosopher.

00:20.080 --> 00:26.160
One of the greatest American philosophers in the analytic tradition.

00:26.160 --> 00:36.480
He was born in 1908 and died in 2000, December 25.

00:36.480 --> 00:43.960
As I said, he was regarded as one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century.

00:43.960 --> 00:49.440
He was a student first at Harvard University and then became a professor there, and he

00:49.440 --> 00:54.000
taught there, I think, until he died.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.960
He made incredible contributions through the philosophy of language, so understanding

00:58.960 --> 01:07.520
of language, metaphysics, and other things.

01:07.520 --> 01:17.480
So in this particular video lecture, I'm going to try to explain what it seems to be according

01:17.480 --> 01:25.600
to Quine, the problem of ontology.

01:25.600 --> 01:39.520
And so I try to explain his famous paper on what there is.

01:39.520 --> 01:48.400
Quine begins his paper by saying a curious thing about the ontological problem is its

01:48.400 --> 01:49.900
simplicity.

01:49.900 --> 01:55.040
It can be put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.040
What is there?

01:56.040 --> 02:01.520
And it can be answered, moreover, in a word, everything.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.760
And everyone will accept this answer as true.

02:04.760 --> 02:13.160
However, this is merely to say that there is what there is, and it's not very helpful.

02:13.160 --> 02:22.720
Quine is going to explain that what there is, what exists in reality, is to be determined

02:22.720 --> 02:35.520
on the basis of what can we translate into a variable, as I will show you in a minute.

02:35.520 --> 02:47.280
Now Quine in this paper wants to show that some of the most popular ontologies of his

02:47.280 --> 02:50.680
time, at least, were false.

02:51.440 --> 02:57.440
Perhaps if not false, they were not well justified.

02:57.440 --> 03:03.760
If you don't remember what ontology is, go back to my video lecture on metaphysics.

03:03.760 --> 03:12.520
Ontology is the sub-branch or the branch of metaphysics that is concerned about existence

03:12.520 --> 03:15.480
of being.

03:15.480 --> 03:24.000
And the objects we can or we should commit to.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.720
What objects do exist?

03:25.720 --> 03:39.120
For example, in my logic course, I teach how to test syllogisms, standard form categorical

03:39.760 --> 03:46.320
syllogisms, by using a technique known as the three-ven diagram technique.

03:46.320 --> 04:06.200
So each venn diagram, these three circles representing each term, as you know, standard

04:06.200 --> 04:10.400
form categorical syllogism has exactly three terms.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.200
So you can use one circle for each term.

04:14.200 --> 04:17.520
So you have three circles and you overlap the circles.

04:17.520 --> 04:25.480
And then you diagram the premises and see if the conclusion is diagrammed as a result

04:25.480 --> 04:28.200
of your diagram in the premises.

04:28.200 --> 04:38.200
So this technique shows you whether a particular diagram is valid.

04:38.200 --> 04:47.680
Now there are several standard form categorical syllogisms.

04:47.680 --> 05:02.560
There are invalid, many that are valid, but also there are syllogisms known as conditionally

05:02.560 --> 05:05.080
valid.

05:05.080 --> 05:09.760
Now the condition is the existence of certain entities.

05:09.760 --> 05:22.720
So once you do the diagramming of the premises and you fill up the circles in the venn diagrams,

05:22.720 --> 05:34.000
if a syllogism has universal premises and a particular conclusion, so in other words,

05:34.000 --> 05:47.560
if the premises are a-form or e-form and the conclusion is an i-form or an o-form, then

05:47.560 --> 05:59.280
those syllogisms are very special, very strange because they may be valid on the condition

05:59.280 --> 06:07.680
that the entities of the subject, and when I say the subject, I mean the subject of the

06:07.680 --> 06:13.040
conclusion, those entities really exist.

06:13.040 --> 06:20.760
Now in that situation, what do you do when you diagram the syllogism?

06:20.760 --> 06:34.640
What you do is that you may place an x in the diagram, and if the x fits the diagram

06:34.640 --> 06:46.800
and shows the conclusion, then that particular syllogism is known as is said to be conditionally

06:46.800 --> 06:49.440
valid.

06:49.920 --> 06:58.320
If this is too confusing, go to my lecture on diagramming testing syllogisms and also

06:58.320 --> 07:07.120
testing varieties, and you will see practically what I do in the video, how I determine the

07:07.120 --> 07:09.200
validity.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.920
But the point that I was trying to make is the x.

07:11.920 --> 07:18.400
The x in logic is the existential import.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.320
It refers to the existential import.

07:21.320 --> 07:27.080
Now the point is, what exists?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.920
When do we use the x?

07:28.920 --> 07:37.200
Well, Quine explains a way out of this puzzle, okay?

07:37.200 --> 07:45.000
Now another thing that I wanted to say about the paper, Quine's paper, is that Quine uses

07:45.000 --> 07:50.720
in the paper some names of hypothetical philosophers.

07:50.720 --> 07:59.360
One is Mech X, and the other one is Wyman, okay?

07:59.360 --> 08:11.520
It's pretty much recognized by many that Mech X is probably Mech Taggart, the British philosopher

08:11.520 --> 08:13.200
Mech Taggart.

08:13.200 --> 08:19.200
I have a video on Mech Taggart on the nature of time, by the way.

08:19.200 --> 08:27.080
And the other Wyman would be Maynong.

08:27.080 --> 08:31.200
I'm not sure why he doesn't address them directly.

08:31.200 --> 08:36.120
It's not important at this point.

08:36.120 --> 08:44.000
But the point of what he's trying to establish, Quine, is to establish a viable standard for

08:44.000 --> 08:45.560
ontological commitment.

08:45.560 --> 08:53.240
In other words, to what entities should I commit?

08:53.240 --> 08:58.720
What entities do exist, and I commit to their existence?

08:58.840 --> 09:05.240
Also, he wants to suggest how we should decide between competing theories.

09:05.240 --> 09:12.360
Now, the paper starts with the riddle of non-being.

09:12.360 --> 09:15.840
There's something known as Plato's Beard.

09:15.840 --> 09:21.720
Plato's Beard says the following, non-being must in some sense be.

09:21.720 --> 09:27.880
Otherwise, what is it that there is not?

09:27.880 --> 09:31.160
Let me explain what this means.

09:31.160 --> 09:38.800
What it means is that statements about objects or properties that don't exist are problematic.

09:38.800 --> 09:44.960
In other words, when you deny the existence of certain objects, for example, you deny

09:44.960 --> 09:45.960
Santa Claus.

09:45.960 --> 09:50.840
Say, Santa Claus does not exist, okay?

09:50.840 --> 09:59.280
Well let's stick to the example given in the paper of Pegasus.

09:59.280 --> 10:12.360
Pegasus, as you know, is a mythical winged horse, Pegasus.

10:12.360 --> 10:19.200
So when you say Pegasus does not exist, what exactly do you mean?

10:19.200 --> 10:23.800
What do you say?

10:23.800 --> 10:35.680
If you deny the existence of Pegasus in their way, you are affirming the existence of Pegasus.

10:35.680 --> 10:38.400
Mech X makes this point.

10:38.400 --> 10:47.000
If Pegasus were not, if Pegasus didn't exist, then we should not be talking about anything

10:47.040 --> 10:50.600
when we say, when we use the word.

10:50.600 --> 10:57.720
Therefore, it would be nonsense to say even that Pegasus is not.

10:57.720 --> 11:01.720
Consider the phrase, Pegasus does not exist.

11:01.720 --> 11:07.840
And ask yourself, is this true or is it false?

11:07.840 --> 11:12.080
If you say yes, it is true.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.080
What makes this true?

11:15.080 --> 11:21.840
What makes this true must be meaning.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.320
Truth requires meaning.

11:25.320 --> 11:29.160
Meaning requires reference.

11:29.160 --> 11:41.040
If the word Pegasus is meaningful at all, then there must be something that refers to the

11:41.040 --> 11:44.640
name Pegasus.

11:44.640 --> 11:54.280
But if there isn't anything to which the word Pegasus refer, then the word Pegasus is meaningless.

11:54.280 --> 12:02.000
But if Pegasus, the word Pegasus is meaningless, then the statement Pegasus does not exist

12:02.000 --> 12:05.160
cannot be true.

12:05.200 --> 12:12.040
But if it's not true, then it must be false that Pegasus doesn't exist.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.840
But think about it now.

12:14.840 --> 12:23.800
If it's false that Pegasus doesn't exist, in order for that sentence to be false, that

12:23.800 --> 12:29.280
implies that Pegasus does exist.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.000
It's a big mess.

12:31.000 --> 12:39.600
So some philosophers like MechEx might respond the following.

12:39.600 --> 12:45.760
Look, Pegasus is an idea, a concept in our minds.

12:45.760 --> 12:54.720
So if the word Pegasus is an idea, then the statement Pegasus does not exist.

12:54.720 --> 12:57.480
The idea does not exist.

12:57.480 --> 13:06.640
It's false because there is or there isn't a certain Pegasus idea.

13:06.640 --> 13:17.600
That's how you make sense of Plato's beard.

13:17.600 --> 13:29.280
Now, Quina observes a problem with MechEx's solution.

13:29.280 --> 13:38.200
He observes that when I talk about things, I understand there is a distinction between

13:38.200 --> 13:42.960
those things and ideas of those things.

13:42.960 --> 13:49.280
So my idea of a table is, call it a brain state.

13:49.280 --> 13:55.600
And a table is an existent object in space and time.

13:55.600 --> 14:01.360
However, what about the idea of Pegasus?

14:01.360 --> 14:08.320
When, first of all, when I say that there is Pegasus, an idea of Pegasus, what is the

14:08.320 --> 14:10.720
idea of Pegasus?

14:10.720 --> 14:18.400
Probably can't be an idea of some other idea, right?

14:18.400 --> 14:24.080
But in any case, when I talk about Pegasus, I am not talking about an idea.

14:24.080 --> 14:31.080
I am talking about a real horse with wings.

14:31.080 --> 14:37.280
So when I deny the existence of Pegasus, I'm not denying the existence of the idea of Pegasus.

14:37.280 --> 14:43.320
I'm denying the existence of a horse that has wings.

14:43.320 --> 14:50.000
Here's another solution to this problem, Plato's beard.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.520
This is Wyman's solution, okay?

14:53.520 --> 15:02.960
Wyman observes there are actual things, like tables, dogs, pizzas, buildings.

15:02.960 --> 15:08.520
And there are things that do not exist, but they could exist.

15:08.520 --> 15:18.880
For example, dragons, rent-free-for-all, and Pegasus, our Pegasus.

15:18.880 --> 15:28.480
Also you have to observe that there are things that could never exist.

15:28.480 --> 15:42.440
These for example, like the round square, or a married bachelor, these are absurd.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.040
They are contradictory in terms.

15:45.040 --> 15:57.280
There can't be such thing as a square that is also round, or a married person who is

15:57.280 --> 16:03.440
not married, or a non-married person who is married.

16:03.440 --> 16:04.560
Great.

16:04.560 --> 16:18.440
So in other words, Wyman's solution is that, to Plato's beard, is that when we say anything

16:18.440 --> 16:25.480
about these things like Pegasus, is that Pegasus, we have to say, is something that could exist.

16:25.480 --> 16:36.400
So in other words, Pegasus subsists, okay, subsists.

16:36.400 --> 16:42.720
So Pegasus has his being as an actualized possible.

16:42.720 --> 16:50.840
So in other words, these are the sphere, the realm of all objects.

16:50.840 --> 16:59.000
And there are actual objects, like for example, horses, okay.

16:59.000 --> 17:05.880
There's a subset of the set of all objects that exist.

17:05.880 --> 17:16.120
But among the set of objects, there are also objects that could exist, or subsist, like

17:16.120 --> 17:20.240
dragons, like Pegasus, okay.

17:20.240 --> 17:27.200
So that's the way we think of these entities.

17:27.200 --> 17:37.280
But Quine observes immediately that if we have no principles to exclude possible objects

17:37.280 --> 17:44.080
from existence, what principle is there against the existence of a round square, right?

17:44.080 --> 17:53.960
If we have to say that Pegasus exists, because it is one of those objects that is contingent,

17:53.960 --> 17:55.160
right?

17:55.160 --> 18:05.600
And so it has existence, while it has, in a sense, because it has subsistence.

18:05.600 --> 18:15.440
But then, how do we know, how do we make a distinction between things that just subsist,

18:15.440 --> 18:22.280
they don't really exist in space and time, they're possible, and they have subsistence.

18:22.280 --> 18:30.000
And existence of round squares and Mary bachelors.

18:30.000 --> 18:36.280
I mean, if they don't really exist in actual reality, then what's the rule?

18:36.280 --> 18:43.200
Then we can say, if there's no rule, we can say, well, then anything could subsist.

18:43.200 --> 18:48.180
Why do we have to say that round squares cannot subsist?

18:48.180 --> 18:54.400
We could say, perhaps, that they do not exist, okay.

18:54.400 --> 19:03.320
But we can't say that they cannot subsist, because what are the rules of subsistence?

19:03.320 --> 19:07.600
So it makes it very messy, very, very complicated.

19:07.600 --> 19:14.400
It's better to get rid of this world of subsistence.

19:14.400 --> 19:22.240
Furthermore, Quine gives an example.

19:22.240 --> 19:27.000
Take, for example, the possible fat man in the doorway.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.800
And again, the possible bald man in that doorway.

19:31.800 --> 19:36.800
Are they the same possible man, or two possible men?

19:36.800 --> 19:39.280
How do we decide?

19:39.280 --> 19:49.840
How can we decide if a possible man or subsistence man, bald man or fat man or whatever, is identical

19:49.840 --> 19:51.440
to another?

19:51.440 --> 19:58.720
It seems that there are no rules of identity in subsistence.

19:58.720 --> 20:02.120
So once again, this is just messy.

20:02.440 --> 20:10.200
It's better to abandon this kind of world of subsistence.

20:10.200 --> 20:18.600
Now let me talk about another objection.

20:18.600 --> 20:23.880
Another objection is that these ontologies presented by MechEx and Wyman, according to

20:23.880 --> 20:28.120
Quine, commit the fallacy of equivocation.

20:28.120 --> 20:31.600
They equivocate meaning and naming.

20:31.600 --> 20:44.240
The fallacy is to assume that just because a term, a word, is meaningful, and it is meaningfully

20:44.240 --> 20:54.920
used, it follows that that term must refer to something that really exists.

20:54.920 --> 21:05.000
Now this error was already pointed out by Russell's theory of definite description.

21:05.000 --> 21:11.480
And also by Frege, when Frege talks about the meaning, the difference between meaning

21:11.480 --> 21:12.480
and naming.

21:12.480 --> 21:19.800
For example, the evening star and the morning star.

21:19.800 --> 21:30.640
The phrase evening star names a planet, the planet Venus, but the morning star names the

21:30.640 --> 21:38.960
same object, but the two phrases don't have the same meaning.

21:38.960 --> 21:42.920
They name the same object, but they don't have the same meaning.

21:43.040 --> 21:50.440
Otherwise the ancients would have known that they were the same object.

21:50.440 --> 21:58.760
That's why they had different names.

21:58.760 --> 22:09.600
So Wyman and MechEx confuse the alleged name, the named object Pegasus, with the meaning

22:09.600 --> 22:12.280
of the word Pegasus.

22:12.280 --> 22:18.040
Before concluding that Pegasus must be, must exist.

22:18.040 --> 22:21.520
So how do we shave Plato's beard?

22:21.520 --> 22:26.640
Well by using Russell's method.

22:26.640 --> 22:36.120
This method says that we have to analyze and translate in illogical form any statement.

22:36.120 --> 22:48.960
For example, the statement, there exists a flying winged horse named Pegasus.

22:48.960 --> 22:58.480
We translate it with these funny logical operators, which means, you say this inverted

22:58.480 --> 23:14.640
E letter means that there exists, there is an X, such that this X, this X is F, it means

23:14.640 --> 23:17.400
it flies.

23:17.400 --> 23:33.520
So also the plus sign, this X is winged and also this X is named Pegasus.

23:33.520 --> 23:42.200
So now I can shave Plato's beard, I can deny the existence of something without creating

23:42.200 --> 23:48.280
any ambiguities by stating the following.

23:48.280 --> 24:01.800
It is not the case that, or it is not true that, there exists or something is a flying

24:01.800 --> 24:04.480
winged horse named Pegasus.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.880
You see the difference.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.760
Now I don't deny the existence of Pegasus.

24:08.760 --> 24:20.240
I deny that there is such a thing as Pegasus, namely an entity that flies, that is an horse,

24:20.240 --> 24:27.480
that is winged, and that is named Pegasus.

24:27.480 --> 24:34.120
As an alternative I can say, I can rephrase Pegasus as a definite description.

24:34.120 --> 24:40.800
For example, the winged horse that was captured by Bellarophon.

24:40.800 --> 24:51.000
So I can say it is not the case that there is such an entity and so on.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.560
Now let us turn to the ontological problem of universals.

24:56.560 --> 25:00.320
I have a video lecture for universal, watch that video lecture.

25:00.320 --> 25:07.800
The question whether there are such entities as attributes, relations, classes, numbers,

25:07.800 --> 25:17.920
functions, mech X, or people like mech X thinks that there are, speaking of attributes we

25:17.920 --> 25:24.480
can say there are red houses, red horses, red sunsets.

25:24.480 --> 25:30.240
Now these houses, roses, and sunsets then have something in common.

25:30.240 --> 25:38.280
And this, which they have in common, is all I mean by the attribute of redness.

25:38.280 --> 25:44.120
So redness would be something that really exists like Plato's forms, if you remember

25:44.120 --> 25:48.080
from my lecture on Plato.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.840
So the argument would be the following.

25:50.840 --> 26:01.560
We correctly classified red houses, red roses, and red sunsets and as things that have the

26:01.560 --> 26:10.600
same color, there must be something, a property that is in common in the world that makes

26:10.600 --> 26:13.720
them belong to the same family.

26:13.720 --> 26:21.720
Or there exists an X that is the shared property of redness, okay?

26:21.720 --> 26:33.800
Now, Quine says, one may admit that there are red houses, red roses, sunsets, but deny

26:33.800 --> 26:37.000
that they have anything in common.

26:37.000 --> 26:46.640
The word red or red objects denotes each of sundry individual entities, which are red

26:46.640 --> 26:49.960
houses, red roses, red sunsets, and so on.

26:49.960 --> 27:01.680
But there is not in addition any entity whatsoever, individual or red or otherwise, which is named

27:01.680 --> 27:07.440
by the word redness.

27:07.440 --> 27:17.920
That houses and roses and sunsets are all of them red, may be taken as ultimate and irreducible.

27:17.920 --> 27:24.920
In other words, why do we classify all things together as red?

27:24.920 --> 27:35.200
Quine says, well, we don't have to postulate redness as an entity or a platonic form.

27:35.200 --> 27:42.760
We can just say simply they have a common property, namely redness.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.640
And what is this common property of redness?

27:46.360 --> 27:55.600
Quine would say, there are red houses, red roses, and red sunsets end of the story.

27:55.600 --> 28:05.280
So in other words, this would be a brute fact, they just resemble.

28:05.280 --> 28:12.600
The doctrine that universals are just names without any corresponding reality, and that

28:12.600 --> 28:16.000
only particular objects exist.

28:16.000 --> 28:27.120
This is with the doctrine that Quine is endorsing.

28:27.120 --> 28:31.140
So in other words, we just say no to properties.

28:31.140 --> 28:38.800
Our commitment to properties isn't informative as an explanation anyway.

28:38.800 --> 28:47.600
So Quine says, it doesn't explain anything, it only postulates even more entities.

28:47.600 --> 28:53.520
We can say that they are brute facts, the fact that they resemble, they have something

28:53.520 --> 28:59.200
in common.

28:59.200 --> 29:04.360
Mech X or any other philosopher doesn't have any explanatory power, doesn't offer any

29:04.360 --> 29:07.200
explanatory power.

29:07.200 --> 29:18.440
There are all the occult entities that he posits under such names of redness.

29:18.440 --> 29:29.600
So what do I gain by saying that there is redness, I don't gain anything.

29:29.600 --> 29:35.000
I can, on the other hand, apply two good principles.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.960
One principle is the Occam's razor.

29:37.960 --> 29:45.760
As you know, Occam's razor says, do not multiply entities unnecessarily.

29:45.760 --> 29:50.240
And so Quine is using Occam's razor as a principle.

29:50.240 --> 29:54.560
Why should we multiply entities unnecessarily?

29:54.560 --> 30:01.520
When we can just say redness is just a brute fact, all these objects are red.

30:01.520 --> 30:08.920
Under the story, why postulating an entity known as red?

30:08.920 --> 30:19.840
And this is supposed to minimize brute facts, although it seems that by saying that it is

30:19.840 --> 30:26.240
a brute fact, it just adds another brute fact.

30:26.240 --> 30:30.960
But anyway, what about meaning?

30:30.960 --> 30:35.200
Now Mech X argues the following, granted.

30:35.200 --> 30:43.000
The description between meaning and naming is fine.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.800
The morning star, the evening star, fine.

30:45.800 --> 30:54.240
But let us even grant that Pegasus or red or redness in other such entities are not names

30:54.240 --> 30:56.400
of attributes.

30:57.400 --> 31:03.840
Still, you admit they have a meaning.

31:03.840 --> 31:13.960
But these meanings, whether they are named or not, are still universal meanings.

31:13.960 --> 31:21.160
So we usually get it right when we classify things, read things.

31:21.160 --> 31:27.680
Quine and I just arbitrarily assign these names and understand these meanings.

31:27.680 --> 31:36.600
So there must be something responsible for our ability to do this and to have meaning.

31:36.600 --> 31:41.480
Quine has nothing against meaning.

31:41.480 --> 31:48.880
However, he says, I feel not reluctant toward refusing to admit meanings.

31:48.880 --> 31:54.640
For I do not thereby deny that words and statements are meaningful.

31:54.640 --> 31:59.760
One thing is to say that there is meaning and something is meaningful.

31:59.760 --> 32:07.400
I remain free to maintain that the fact that a given linguistic utterance is meaningful

32:07.400 --> 32:16.920
or significant, as I prefer to say, is an ultimate irreducible matter of fact.

32:16.960 --> 32:26.320
Or I may undertake to analyze it in terms of directly of what people do in the presence

32:26.320 --> 32:35.760
of linguistic utterance, a linguistic utterance in question, and other utterances similar

32:35.760 --> 32:37.280
to it.

32:37.280 --> 32:44.080
In other words, what Quine is not advocating but he's suggesting, I don't have to say

32:44.080 --> 32:45.400
that there's meaning.

32:45.400 --> 32:57.040
I can simply say that explaining in behavioristic terms, saying that something is meaningful

32:57.040 --> 33:09.400
because it is a disposition to behave in a certain way with respect to an utterance.

33:09.400 --> 33:21.560
For example, some dogs are white and not thereby commit ourselves to recognizing either doghood

33:21.560 --> 33:24.120
or whiteness as entities.

33:24.120 --> 33:28.960
Some dogs are white, says that some things that are dogs are white.

33:28.960 --> 33:37.000
And in order that this statement be true, the things over which the bound variable

33:37.000 --> 33:46.800
something ranges must include some white dogs but need not include whiteness or dogness.

33:46.800 --> 33:56.920
So once again, we can analyze it in a logical way and say that there are some things that

33:56.920 --> 33:59.960
are white and there are dogs.

33:59.960 --> 34:05.600
This is nothing to do with dogness and whiteness.

34:05.600 --> 34:14.600
And we can make sense of what we mean by some dogs or many dogs are white.

34:14.600 --> 34:22.840
So Quine says that there seem to be three options, Platonism, which I discuss at length

34:22.840 --> 34:33.040
in my video on Plato, Plato's metaphysics, which argues that there are abstract entities.

34:33.040 --> 34:37.680
They exist independently of human beings and human minds.

34:37.680 --> 34:45.840
The second option is conceptualism, which says that abstract entities exist but only

34:45.840 --> 34:49.560
as concepts in our minds.

34:49.560 --> 34:52.600
And then the third one is nominalism.

34:52.600 --> 34:58.680
There are no abstract entities, we just use terms.

34:58.680 --> 35:01.520
How do we decide between them?

35:01.520 --> 35:08.480
Well Quine says that we have to decide which one is correct by doing the same thing that

35:08.480 --> 35:10.720
scientists do.

35:10.720 --> 35:11.920
What do they do?

35:11.920 --> 35:21.240
We posit some hypotheses and then we test these hypotheses by making decisions based

35:21.240 --> 35:24.840
on theoretical principles.

35:24.840 --> 35:33.600
For example, simplicity, which one is more simple, is simpler or is the simplest?

35:33.600 --> 35:40.400
The better hypothesis is the simpler one or the simplest.

35:40.400 --> 35:49.680
Usefulness, so the better hypothesis is the one that is useful, that explains more, that

35:49.680 --> 35:59.720
has greater predictive power and explanatory power and also coherence.

35:59.720 --> 36:04.600
The better hypothesis is the one that is more coherent.

36:04.600 --> 36:14.440
It does not conflict with other truths that we accept, that we have already established

36:14.440 --> 36:23.760
and we hold as true and we have strong reasons to believe to be true.

36:23.760 --> 36:28.640
Quine, by the way, prefers nominalism.

36:28.640 --> 36:35.040
Mathematicians could deny, for example, that there is a prime number greater than 10, yet

36:35.040 --> 36:46.200
find it useful, very useful to act as if numbers existed.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.800
So what is the conclusion?

36:48.800 --> 36:51.960
Well the conclusion is rather inconclusive.

36:51.960 --> 36:59.680
The question of what ontology actually to adopt, Quine says, still stands open.

36:59.680 --> 37:09.320
Let us by all means see how much of a physicalistic conceptual scheme can be reduced to a phenomenalistic

37:09.320 --> 37:11.440
one.

37:11.440 --> 37:18.840
Viewed from within the phenomenalistic conceptual scheme, the ontologies of physical objects

37:18.840 --> 37:23.480
and mathematical objects are myths.

37:23.480 --> 37:27.400
The quality of the myth, however, is relative.

37:27.480 --> 37:34.840
Moving in this case to the epistemological point of view, this point of view is one among

37:34.840 --> 37:41.400
various corresponding to one among our various interests and purposes.

37:41.400 --> 37:49.240
In other words, what is there to answer the original question at the outset?

37:49.240 --> 37:50.560
What is there?

37:50.560 --> 38:00.440
What is there is, we don't really know ultimately what is there, but we have to commit only

38:00.440 --> 38:11.200
to those entities that can pass the logical test.

38:11.200 --> 38:21.000
These that pass the logical test and we cannot speculate that these things really exist.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.360
Some of these things really exist.

38:23.360 --> 38:31.600
Some of these things are objects that exist in a nominal sense, in a useful sense, for

38:31.600 --> 38:33.800
example, mathematical objects.

38:33.800 --> 38:44.880
So as long as they contribute to some meaning and understanding of other things in the world.

38:44.880 --> 38:57.880
So Quine sums up that his applications of Russell's method to Plato rules out the reasoning

38:57.880 --> 39:00.320
behind some ontologies.

39:00.320 --> 39:06.840
So we can discard some ontologies, a linguistic subject does not entail the existence of a

39:06.840 --> 39:11.880
corresponding abstract entity, for example, Pegasus.

39:11.880 --> 39:17.000
We can make sense of Pegasus, we can deny the existence of Pegasus without creating

39:17.000 --> 39:19.800
any problems.

39:19.800 --> 39:26.640
Now Quine suggests that we continue to pursue our ontologies in an open-minded and experimental

39:26.640 --> 39:27.640
spirit.

39:27.640 --> 39:33.440
So in sum, the question, what is there?

39:33.440 --> 39:42.520
Quine responds, I don't know, but Quine can't infer the existence of a certain abstract entity

39:42.520 --> 39:49.600
or entities, ideas, universal meanings, via Plato's beard.

39:49.600 --> 40:01.960
Quine himself, then as I said, is a materialist when it comes to ontology, arguing that although

40:01.960 --> 40:10.840
abstract entities exist in a certain sense, they were not mental.

40:10.840 --> 40:22.440
They exist in a sense that we can regard them as useful, the useful entities.

40:22.440 --> 40:31.040
If they ultimately exist, we don't know, but we don't have to commit to their existence.

40:31.040 --> 40:34.760
And this is the end of another video lecture.

40:34.760 --> 40:37.840
Thank you for watching, I'll see you next time.
