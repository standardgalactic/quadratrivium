0	6560	Hi, and welcome to another philosophy lecture.
6560	16360	This is going to be an interesting one, Willard Van Orman-Quine, on what there is.
16360	20080	Quine was a very influential philosopher.
20080	26160	One of the greatest American philosophers in the analytic tradition.
26160	36480	He was born in 1908 and died in 2000, December 25.
36480	43960	As I said, he was regarded as one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century.
43960	49440	He was a student first at Harvard University and then became a professor there, and he
49440	54000	taught there, I think, until he died.
54000	58960	He made incredible contributions through the philosophy of language, so understanding
58960	67520	of language, metaphysics, and other things.
67520	77480	So in this particular video lecture, I'm going to try to explain what it seems to be according
77480	85600	to Quine, the problem of ontology.
85600	99520	And so I try to explain his famous paper on what there is.
99520	108400	Quine begins his paper by saying a curious thing about the ontological problem is its
108400	109900	simplicity.
109900	115040	It can be put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables.
115040	116040	What is there?
116040	121520	And it can be answered, moreover, in a word, everything.
121520	124760	And everyone will accept this answer as true.
124760	133160	However, this is merely to say that there is what there is, and it's not very helpful.
133160	142720	Quine is going to explain that what there is, what exists in reality, is to be determined
142720	155520	on the basis of what can we translate into a variable, as I will show you in a minute.
155520	167280	Now Quine in this paper wants to show that some of the most popular ontologies of his
167280	170680	time, at least, were false.
171440	177440	Perhaps if not false, they were not well justified.
177440	183760	If you don't remember what ontology is, go back to my video lecture on metaphysics.
183760	192520	Ontology is the sub-branch or the branch of metaphysics that is concerned about existence
192520	195480	of being.
195480	204000	And the objects we can or we should commit to.
204000	205720	What objects do exist?
205720	219120	For example, in my logic course, I teach how to test syllogisms, standard form categorical
219760	226320	syllogisms, by using a technique known as the three-ven diagram technique.
226320	246200	So each venn diagram, these three circles representing each term, as you know, standard
246200	250400	form categorical syllogism has exactly three terms.
250400	254200	So you can use one circle for each term.
254200	257520	So you have three circles and you overlap the circles.
257520	265480	And then you diagram the premises and see if the conclusion is diagrammed as a result
265480	268200	of your diagram in the premises.
268200	278200	So this technique shows you whether a particular diagram is valid.
278200	287680	Now there are several standard form categorical syllogisms.
287680	302560	There are invalid, many that are valid, but also there are syllogisms known as conditionally
302560	305080	valid.
305080	309760	Now the condition is the existence of certain entities.
309760	322720	So once you do the diagramming of the premises and you fill up the circles in the venn diagrams,
322720	334000	if a syllogism has universal premises and a particular conclusion, so in other words,
334000	347560	if the premises are a-form or e-form and the conclusion is an i-form or an o-form, then
347560	359280	those syllogisms are very special, very strange because they may be valid on the condition
359280	367680	that the entities of the subject, and when I say the subject, I mean the subject of the
367680	373040	conclusion, those entities really exist.
373040	380760	Now in that situation, what do you do when you diagram the syllogism?
380760	394640	What you do is that you may place an x in the diagram, and if the x fits the diagram
394640	406800	and shows the conclusion, then that particular syllogism is known as is said to be conditionally
406800	409440	valid.
409920	418320	If this is too confusing, go to my lecture on diagramming testing syllogisms and also
418320	427120	testing varieties, and you will see practically what I do in the video, how I determine the
427120	429200	validity.
429200	431920	But the point that I was trying to make is the x.
431920	438400	The x in logic is the existential import.
438400	441320	It refers to the existential import.
441320	447080	Now the point is, what exists?
447080	448920	When do we use the x?
448920	457200	Well, Quine explains a way out of this puzzle, okay?
457200	465000	Now another thing that I wanted to say about the paper, Quine's paper, is that Quine uses
465000	470720	in the paper some names of hypothetical philosophers.
470720	479360	One is Mech X, and the other one is Wyman, okay?
479360	491520	It's pretty much recognized by many that Mech X is probably Mech Taggart, the British philosopher
491520	493200	Mech Taggart.
493200	499200	I have a video on Mech Taggart on the nature of time, by the way.
499200	507080	And the other Wyman would be Maynong.
507080	511200	I'm not sure why he doesn't address them directly.
511200	516120	It's not important at this point.
516120	524000	But the point of what he's trying to establish, Quine, is to establish a viable standard for
524000	525560	ontological commitment.
525560	533240	In other words, to what entities should I commit?
533240	538720	What entities do exist, and I commit to their existence?
538840	545240	Also, he wants to suggest how we should decide between competing theories.
545240	552360	Now, the paper starts with the riddle of non-being.
552360	555840	There's something known as Plato's Beard.
555840	561720	Plato's Beard says the following, non-being must in some sense be.
561720	567880	Otherwise, what is it that there is not?
567880	571160	Let me explain what this means.
571160	578800	What it means is that statements about objects or properties that don't exist are problematic.
578800	584960	In other words, when you deny the existence of certain objects, for example, you deny
584960	585960	Santa Claus.
585960	590840	Say, Santa Claus does not exist, okay?
590840	599280	Well let's stick to the example given in the paper of Pegasus.
599280	612360	Pegasus, as you know, is a mythical winged horse, Pegasus.
612360	619200	So when you say Pegasus does not exist, what exactly do you mean?
619200	623800	What do you say?
623800	635680	If you deny the existence of Pegasus in their way, you are affirming the existence of Pegasus.
635680	638400	Mech X makes this point.
638400	647000	If Pegasus were not, if Pegasus didn't exist, then we should not be talking about anything
647040	650600	when we say, when we use the word.
650600	657720	Therefore, it would be nonsense to say even that Pegasus is not.
657720	661720	Consider the phrase, Pegasus does not exist.
661720	667840	And ask yourself, is this true or is it false?
667840	672080	If you say yes, it is true.
672080	674080	What makes this true?
675080	681840	What makes this true must be meaning.
681840	685320	Truth requires meaning.
685320	689160	Meaning requires reference.
689160	701040	If the word Pegasus is meaningful at all, then there must be something that refers to the
701040	704640	name Pegasus.
704640	714280	But if there isn't anything to which the word Pegasus refer, then the word Pegasus is meaningless.
714280	722000	But if Pegasus, the word Pegasus is meaningless, then the statement Pegasus does not exist
722000	725160	cannot be true.
725200	732040	But if it's not true, then it must be false that Pegasus doesn't exist.
732040	734840	But think about it now.
734840	743800	If it's false that Pegasus doesn't exist, in order for that sentence to be false, that
743800	749280	implies that Pegasus does exist.
749280	751000	It's a big mess.
751000	759600	So some philosophers like MechEx might respond the following.
759600	765760	Look, Pegasus is an idea, a concept in our minds.
765760	774720	So if the word Pegasus is an idea, then the statement Pegasus does not exist.
774720	777480	The idea does not exist.
777480	786640	It's false because there is or there isn't a certain Pegasus idea.
786640	797600	That's how you make sense of Plato's beard.
797600	809280	Now, Quina observes a problem with MechEx's solution.
809280	818200	He observes that when I talk about things, I understand there is a distinction between
818200	822960	those things and ideas of those things.
822960	829280	So my idea of a table is, call it a brain state.
829280	835600	And a table is an existent object in space and time.
835600	841360	However, what about the idea of Pegasus?
841360	848320	When, first of all, when I say that there is Pegasus, an idea of Pegasus, what is the
848320	850720	idea of Pegasus?
850720	858400	Probably can't be an idea of some other idea, right?
858400	864080	But in any case, when I talk about Pegasus, I am not talking about an idea.
864080	871080	I am talking about a real horse with wings.
871080	877280	So when I deny the existence of Pegasus, I'm not denying the existence of the idea of Pegasus.
877280	883320	I'm denying the existence of a horse that has wings.
883320	890000	Here's another solution to this problem, Plato's beard.
890000	893520	This is Wyman's solution, okay?
893520	902960	Wyman observes there are actual things, like tables, dogs, pizzas, buildings.
902960	908520	And there are things that do not exist, but they could exist.
908520	918880	For example, dragons, rent-free-for-all, and Pegasus, our Pegasus.
918880	928480	Also you have to observe that there are things that could never exist.
928480	942440	These for example, like the round square, or a married bachelor, these are absurd.
942440	945040	They are contradictory in terms.
945040	957280	There can't be such thing as a square that is also round, or a married person who is
957280	963440	not married, or a non-married person who is married.
963440	964560	Great.
964560	978440	So in other words, Wyman's solution is that, to Plato's beard, is that when we say anything
978440	985480	about these things like Pegasus, is that Pegasus, we have to say, is something that could exist.
985480	996400	So in other words, Pegasus subsists, okay, subsists.
996400	1002720	So Pegasus has his being as an actualized possible.
1002720	1010840	So in other words, these are the sphere, the realm of all objects.
1010840	1019000	And there are actual objects, like for example, horses, okay.
1019000	1025880	There's a subset of the set of all objects that exist.
1025880	1036120	But among the set of objects, there are also objects that could exist, or subsist, like
1036120	1040240	dragons, like Pegasus, okay.
1040240	1047200	So that's the way we think of these entities.
1047200	1057280	But Quine observes immediately that if we have no principles to exclude possible objects
1057280	1064080	from existence, what principle is there against the existence of a round square, right?
1064080	1073960	If we have to say that Pegasus exists, because it is one of those objects that is contingent,
1073960	1075160	right?
1075160	1085600	And so it has existence, while it has, in a sense, because it has subsistence.
1085600	1095440	But then, how do we know, how do we make a distinction between things that just subsist,
1095440	1102280	they don't really exist in space and time, they're possible, and they have subsistence.
1102280	1110000	And existence of round squares and Mary bachelors.
1110000	1116280	I mean, if they don't really exist in actual reality, then what's the rule?
1116280	1123200	Then we can say, if there's no rule, we can say, well, then anything could subsist.
1123200	1128180	Why do we have to say that round squares cannot subsist?
1128180	1134400	We could say, perhaps, that they do not exist, okay.
1134400	1143320	But we can't say that they cannot subsist, because what are the rules of subsistence?
1143320	1147600	So it makes it very messy, very, very complicated.
1147600	1154400	It's better to get rid of this world of subsistence.
1154400	1162240	Furthermore, Quine gives an example.
1162240	1167000	Take, for example, the possible fat man in the doorway.
1167000	1171800	And again, the possible bald man in that doorway.
1171800	1176800	Are they the same possible man, or two possible men?
1176800	1179280	How do we decide?
1179280	1189840	How can we decide if a possible man or subsistence man, bald man or fat man or whatever, is identical
1189840	1191440	to another?
1191440	1198720	It seems that there are no rules of identity in subsistence.
1198720	1202120	So once again, this is just messy.
1202440	1210200	It's better to abandon this kind of world of subsistence.
1210200	1218600	Now let me talk about another objection.
1218600	1223880	Another objection is that these ontologies presented by MechEx and Wyman, according to
1223880	1228120	Quine, commit the fallacy of equivocation.
1228120	1231600	They equivocate meaning and naming.
1231600	1244240	The fallacy is to assume that just because a term, a word, is meaningful, and it is meaningfully
1244240	1254920	used, it follows that that term must refer to something that really exists.
1254920	1265000	Now this error was already pointed out by Russell's theory of definite description.
1265000	1271480	And also by Frege, when Frege talks about the meaning, the difference between meaning
1271480	1272480	and naming.
1272480	1279800	For example, the evening star and the morning star.
1279800	1290640	The phrase evening star names a planet, the planet Venus, but the morning star names the
1290640	1298960	same object, but the two phrases don't have the same meaning.
1298960	1302920	They name the same object, but they don't have the same meaning.
1303040	1310440	Otherwise the ancients would have known that they were the same object.
1310440	1318760	That's why they had different names.
1318760	1329600	So Wyman and MechEx confuse the alleged name, the named object Pegasus, with the meaning
1329600	1332280	of the word Pegasus.
1332280	1338040	Before concluding that Pegasus must be, must exist.
1338040	1341520	So how do we shave Plato's beard?
1341520	1346640	Well by using Russell's method.
1346640	1356120	This method says that we have to analyze and translate in illogical form any statement.
1356120	1368960	For example, the statement, there exists a flying winged horse named Pegasus.
1368960	1378480	We translate it with these funny logical operators, which means, you say this inverted
1378480	1394640	E letter means that there exists, there is an X, such that this X, this X is F, it means
1394640	1397400	it flies.
1397400	1413520	So also the plus sign, this X is winged and also this X is named Pegasus.
1413520	1422200	So now I can shave Plato's beard, I can deny the existence of something without creating
1422200	1428280	any ambiguities by stating the following.
1428280	1441800	It is not the case that, or it is not true that, there exists or something is a flying
1441800	1444480	winged horse named Pegasus.
1444480	1445880	You see the difference.
1445880	1448760	Now I don't deny the existence of Pegasus.
1448760	1460240	I deny that there is such a thing as Pegasus, namely an entity that flies, that is an horse,
1460240	1467480	that is winged, and that is named Pegasus.
1467480	1474120	As an alternative I can say, I can rephrase Pegasus as a definite description.
1474120	1480800	For example, the winged horse that was captured by Bellarophon.
1480800	1491000	So I can say it is not the case that there is such an entity and so on.
1491000	1496560	Now let us turn to the ontological problem of universals.
1496560	1500320	I have a video lecture for universal, watch that video lecture.
1500320	1507800	The question whether there are such entities as attributes, relations, classes, numbers,
1507800	1517920	functions, mech X, or people like mech X thinks that there are, speaking of attributes we
1517920	1524480	can say there are red houses, red horses, red sunsets.
1524480	1530240	Now these houses, roses, and sunsets then have something in common.
1530240	1538280	And this, which they have in common, is all I mean by the attribute of redness.
1538280	1544120	So redness would be something that really exists like Plato's forms, if you remember
1544120	1548080	from my lecture on Plato.
1548080	1550840	So the argument would be the following.
1550840	1561560	We correctly classified red houses, red roses, and red sunsets and as things that have the
1561560	1570600	same color, there must be something, a property that is in common in the world that makes
1570600	1573720	them belong to the same family.
1573720	1581720	Or there exists an X that is the shared property of redness, okay?
1581720	1593800	Now, Quine says, one may admit that there are red houses, red roses, sunsets, but deny
1593800	1597000	that they have anything in common.
1597000	1606640	The word red or red objects denotes each of sundry individual entities, which are red
1606640	1609960	houses, red roses, red sunsets, and so on.
1609960	1621680	But there is not in addition any entity whatsoever, individual or red or otherwise, which is named
1621680	1627440	by the word redness.
1627440	1637920	That houses and roses and sunsets are all of them red, may be taken as ultimate and irreducible.
1637920	1644920	In other words, why do we classify all things together as red?
1644920	1655200	Quine says, well, we don't have to postulate redness as an entity or a platonic form.
1655200	1662760	We can just say simply they have a common property, namely redness.
1662760	1665640	And what is this common property of redness?
1666360	1675600	Quine would say, there are red houses, red roses, and red sunsets end of the story.
1675600	1685280	So in other words, this would be a brute fact, they just resemble.
1685280	1692600	The doctrine that universals are just names without any corresponding reality, and that
1692600	1696000	only particular objects exist.
1696000	1707120	This is with the doctrine that Quine is endorsing.
1707120	1711140	So in other words, we just say no to properties.
1711140	1718800	Our commitment to properties isn't informative as an explanation anyway.
1718800	1727600	So Quine says, it doesn't explain anything, it only postulates even more entities.
1727600	1733520	We can say that they are brute facts, the fact that they resemble, they have something
1733520	1739200	in common.
1739200	1744360	Mech X or any other philosopher doesn't have any explanatory power, doesn't offer any
1744360	1747200	explanatory power.
1747200	1758440	There are all the occult entities that he posits under such names of redness.
1758440	1769600	So what do I gain by saying that there is redness, I don't gain anything.
1769600	1775000	I can, on the other hand, apply two good principles.
1775000	1777960	One principle is the Occam's razor.
1777960	1785760	As you know, Occam's razor says, do not multiply entities unnecessarily.
1785760	1790240	And so Quine is using Occam's razor as a principle.
1790240	1794560	Why should we multiply entities unnecessarily?
1794560	1801520	When we can just say redness is just a brute fact, all these objects are red.
1801520	1808920	Under the story, why postulating an entity known as red?
1808920	1819840	And this is supposed to minimize brute facts, although it seems that by saying that it is
1819840	1826240	a brute fact, it just adds another brute fact.
1826240	1830960	But anyway, what about meaning?
1830960	1835200	Now Mech X argues the following, granted.
1835200	1843000	The description between meaning and naming is fine.
1843000	1845800	The morning star, the evening star, fine.
1845800	1854240	But let us even grant that Pegasus or red or redness in other such entities are not names
1854240	1856400	of attributes.
1857400	1863840	Still, you admit they have a meaning.
1863840	1873960	But these meanings, whether they are named or not, are still universal meanings.
1873960	1881160	So we usually get it right when we classify things, read things.
1881160	1887680	Quine and I just arbitrarily assign these names and understand these meanings.
1887680	1896600	So there must be something responsible for our ability to do this and to have meaning.
1896600	1901480	Quine has nothing against meaning.
1901480	1908880	However, he says, I feel not reluctant toward refusing to admit meanings.
1908880	1914640	For I do not thereby deny that words and statements are meaningful.
1914640	1919760	One thing is to say that there is meaning and something is meaningful.
1919760	1927400	I remain free to maintain that the fact that a given linguistic utterance is meaningful
1927400	1936920	or significant, as I prefer to say, is an ultimate irreducible matter of fact.
1936960	1946320	Or I may undertake to analyze it in terms of directly of what people do in the presence
1946320	1955760	of linguistic utterance, a linguistic utterance in question, and other utterances similar
1955760	1957280	to it.
1957280	1964080	In other words, what Quine is not advocating but he's suggesting, I don't have to say
1964080	1965400	that there's meaning.
1965400	1977040	I can simply say that explaining in behavioristic terms, saying that something is meaningful
1977040	1989400	because it is a disposition to behave in a certain way with respect to an utterance.
1989400	2001560	For example, some dogs are white and not thereby commit ourselves to recognizing either doghood
2001560	2004120	or whiteness as entities.
2004120	2008960	Some dogs are white, says that some things that are dogs are white.
2008960	2017000	And in order that this statement be true, the things over which the bound variable
2017000	2026800	something ranges must include some white dogs but need not include whiteness or dogness.
2026800	2036920	So once again, we can analyze it in a logical way and say that there are some things that
2036920	2039960	are white and there are dogs.
2039960	2045600	This is nothing to do with dogness and whiteness.
2045600	2054600	And we can make sense of what we mean by some dogs or many dogs are white.
2054600	2062840	So Quine says that there seem to be three options, Platonism, which I discuss at length
2062840	2073040	in my video on Plato, Plato's metaphysics, which argues that there are abstract entities.
2073040	2077680	They exist independently of human beings and human minds.
2077680	2085840	The second option is conceptualism, which says that abstract entities exist but only
2085840	2089560	as concepts in our minds.
2089560	2092600	And then the third one is nominalism.
2092600	2098680	There are no abstract entities, we just use terms.
2098680	2101520	How do we decide between them?
2101520	2108480	Well Quine says that we have to decide which one is correct by doing the same thing that
2108480	2110720	scientists do.
2110720	2111920	What do they do?
2111920	2121240	We posit some hypotheses and then we test these hypotheses by making decisions based
2121240	2124840	on theoretical principles.
2124840	2133600	For example, simplicity, which one is more simple, is simpler or is the simplest?
2133600	2140400	The better hypothesis is the simpler one or the simplest.
2140400	2149680	Usefulness, so the better hypothesis is the one that is useful, that explains more, that
2149680	2159720	has greater predictive power and explanatory power and also coherence.
2159720	2164600	The better hypothesis is the one that is more coherent.
2164600	2174440	It does not conflict with other truths that we accept, that we have already established
2174440	2183760	and we hold as true and we have strong reasons to believe to be true.
2183760	2188640	Quine, by the way, prefers nominalism.
2188640	2195040	Mathematicians could deny, for example, that there is a prime number greater than 10, yet
2195040	2206200	find it useful, very useful to act as if numbers existed.
2206200	2208800	So what is the conclusion?
2208800	2211960	Well the conclusion is rather inconclusive.
2211960	2219680	The question of what ontology actually to adopt, Quine says, still stands open.
2219680	2229320	Let us by all means see how much of a physicalistic conceptual scheme can be reduced to a phenomenalistic
2229320	2231440	one.
2231440	2238840	Viewed from within the phenomenalistic conceptual scheme, the ontologies of physical objects
2238840	2243480	and mathematical objects are myths.
2243480	2247400	The quality of the myth, however, is relative.
2247480	2254840	Moving in this case to the epistemological point of view, this point of view is one among
2254840	2261400	various corresponding to one among our various interests and purposes.
2261400	2269240	In other words, what is there to answer the original question at the outset?
2269240	2270560	What is there?
2270560	2280440	What is there is, we don't really know ultimately what is there, but we have to commit only
2280440	2291200	to those entities that can pass the logical test.
2291200	2301000	These that pass the logical test and we cannot speculate that these things really exist.
2301000	2303360	Some of these things really exist.
2303360	2311600	Some of these things are objects that exist in a nominal sense, in a useful sense, for
2311600	2313800	example, mathematical objects.
2313800	2324880	So as long as they contribute to some meaning and understanding of other things in the world.
2324880	2337880	So Quine sums up that his applications of Russell's method to Plato rules out the reasoning
2337880	2340320	behind some ontologies.
2340320	2346840	So we can discard some ontologies, a linguistic subject does not entail the existence of a
2346840	2351880	corresponding abstract entity, for example, Pegasus.
2351880	2357000	We can make sense of Pegasus, we can deny the existence of Pegasus without creating
2357000	2359800	any problems.
2359800	2366640	Now Quine suggests that we continue to pursue our ontologies in an open-minded and experimental
2366640	2367640	spirit.
2367640	2373440	So in sum, the question, what is there?
2373440	2382520	Quine responds, I don't know, but Quine can't infer the existence of a certain abstract entity
2382520	2389600	or entities, ideas, universal meanings, via Plato's beard.
2389600	2401960	Quine himself, then as I said, is a materialist when it comes to ontology, arguing that although
2401960	2410840	abstract entities exist in a certain sense, they were not mental.
2410840	2422440	They exist in a sense that we can regard them as useful, the useful entities.
2422440	2431040	If they ultimately exist, we don't know, but we don't have to commit to their existence.
2431040	2434760	And this is the end of another video lecture.
2434760	2437840	Thank you for watching, I'll see you next time.
