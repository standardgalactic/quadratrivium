Checking Dr. ALVARO/QUINE W. V. O. - ON WHAT THERE IS.txt
1. **W.V.O. Quine** discusses the question "What is there?" and suggests that the ontological commitment one makes is influenced by one's linguistic practices. He presents three options for understanding abstract entities: Platonism, conceptualism, and nominalism.

2. **Platonism** posits that abstract entities exist independently of human beings and minds.

3. **Conceptualism** suggests that abstract entities exist but only as concepts in our minds.

4. **Nominalism** denies the existence of abstract entities, maintaining that we use terms to refer to concrete instances rather than abstract concepts.

5. Quine prefers **nominalism**, arguing that we can usefully act as if numbers and other mathematical objects exist, even though they might not in a strict ontological sense.

6. To decide between different ontologies, Quine suggests adopting the same method as scientists: formulating hypotheses, then testing them based on principles like simplicity, usefulness, explanatory power, and coherence with other accepted truths.

7. Quine's preference for nominalism means he is a materialist in ontology, acknowledging the utility of abstract entities but not their independent existence.

8. **In conclusion**, Quine argues that we should continue to explore ontologies experimentally and pragmatically, without committing to the existence of abstract entities unless they pass the logical test of being meaningful and useful within our conceptual schemes.

9. The question "What is there?" thus remains open, with Quine emphasizing that our linguistic practices should guide our ontological commitments, but not necessarily dictate the existence of the entities those terms might refer to.
