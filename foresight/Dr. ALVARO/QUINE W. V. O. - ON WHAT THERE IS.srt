1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
Hi, and welcome to another philosophy lecture.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:16,360
This is going to be an interesting one, Willard Van Orman-Quine, on what there is.

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,080
Quine was a very influential philosopher.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,160
One of the greatest American philosophers in the analytic tradition.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:36,480
He was born in 1908 and died in 2000, December 25.

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,960
As I said, he was regarded as one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century.

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,440
He was a student first at Harvard University and then became a professor there, and he

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,000
taught there, I think, until he died.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,960
He made incredible contributions through the philosophy of language, so understanding

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:07,520
of language, metaphysics, and other things.

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:17,480
So in this particular video lecture, I'm going to try to explain what it seems to be according

12
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:25,600
to Quine, the problem of ontology.

13
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:39,520
And so I try to explain his famous paper on what there is.

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:48,400
Quine begins his paper by saying a curious thing about the ontological problem is its

15
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,900
simplicity.

16
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,040
It can be put in three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables.

17
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
What is there?

18
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,520
And it can be answered, moreover, in a word, everything.

19
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,760
And everyone will accept this answer as true.

20
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:13,160
However, this is merely to say that there is what there is, and it's not very helpful.

21
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:22,720
Quine is going to explain that what there is, what exists in reality, is to be determined

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:35,520
on the basis of what can we translate into a variable, as I will show you in a minute.

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:47,280
Now Quine in this paper wants to show that some of the most popular ontologies of his

24
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,680
time, at least, were false.

25
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,440
Perhaps if not false, they were not well justified.

26
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,760
If you don't remember what ontology is, go back to my video lecture on metaphysics.

27
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:12,520
Ontology is the sub-branch or the branch of metaphysics that is concerned about existence

28
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,480
of being.

29
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:24,000
And the objects we can or we should commit to.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,720
What objects do exist?

31
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:39,120
For example, in my logic course, I teach how to test syllogisms, standard form categorical

32
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,320
syllogisms, by using a technique known as the three-ven diagram technique.

33
00:03:46,320 --> 00:04:06,200
So each venn diagram, these three circles representing each term, as you know, standard

34
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,400
form categorical syllogism has exactly three terms.

35
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,200
So you can use one circle for each term.

36
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,520
So you have three circles and you overlap the circles.

37
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:25,480
And then you diagram the premises and see if the conclusion is diagrammed as a result

38
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,200
of your diagram in the premises.

39
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:38,200
So this technique shows you whether a particular diagram is valid.

40
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:47,680
Now there are several standard form categorical syllogisms.

41
00:04:47,680 --> 00:05:02,560
There are invalid, many that are valid, but also there are syllogisms known as conditionally

42
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,080
valid.

43
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,760
Now the condition is the existence of certain entities.

44
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:22,720
So once you do the diagramming of the premises and you fill up the circles in the venn diagrams,

45
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:34,000
if a syllogism has universal premises and a particular conclusion, so in other words,

46
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:47,560
if the premises are a-form or e-form and the conclusion is an i-form or an o-form, then

47
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:59,280
those syllogisms are very special, very strange because they may be valid on the condition

48
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,680
that the entities of the subject, and when I say the subject, I mean the subject of the

49
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,040
conclusion, those entities really exist.

50
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:20,760
Now in that situation, what do you do when you diagram the syllogism?

51
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:34,640
What you do is that you may place an x in the diagram, and if the x fits the diagram

52
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:46,800
and shows the conclusion, then that particular syllogism is known as is said to be conditionally

53
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,440
valid.

54
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:58,320
If this is too confusing, go to my lecture on diagramming testing syllogisms and also

55
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:07,120
testing varieties, and you will see practically what I do in the video, how I determine the

56
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,200
validity.

57
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,920
But the point that I was trying to make is the x.

58
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,400
The x in logic is the existential import.

59
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,320
It refers to the existential import.

60
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,080
Now the point is, what exists?

61
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,920
When do we use the x?

62
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:37,200
Well, Quine explains a way out of this puzzle, okay?

63
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:45,000
Now another thing that I wanted to say about the paper, Quine's paper, is that Quine uses

64
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,720
in the paper some names of hypothetical philosophers.

65
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:59,360
One is Mech X, and the other one is Wyman, okay?

66
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:11,520
It's pretty much recognized by many that Mech X is probably Mech Taggart, the British philosopher

67
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,200
Mech Taggart.

68
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,200
I have a video on Mech Taggart on the nature of time, by the way.

69
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:27,080
And the other Wyman would be Maynong.

70
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,200
I'm not sure why he doesn't address them directly.

71
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,120
It's not important at this point.

72
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:44,000
But the point of what he's trying to establish, Quine, is to establish a viable standard for

73
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,560
ontological commitment.

74
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:53,240
In other words, to what entities should I commit?

75
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,720
What entities do exist, and I commit to their existence?

76
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:05,240
Also, he wants to suggest how we should decide between competing theories.

77
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:12,360
Now, the paper starts with the riddle of non-being.

78
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,840
There's something known as Plato's Beard.

79
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,720
Plato's Beard says the following, non-being must in some sense be.

80
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,880
Otherwise, what is it that there is not?

81
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,160
Let me explain what this means.

82
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:38,800
What it means is that statements about objects or properties that don't exist are problematic.

83
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,960
In other words, when you deny the existence of certain objects, for example, you deny

84
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
Santa Claus.

85
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,840
Say, Santa Claus does not exist, okay?

86
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:59,280
Well let's stick to the example given in the paper of Pegasus.

87
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:12,360
Pegasus, as you know, is a mythical winged horse, Pegasus.

88
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,200
So when you say Pegasus does not exist, what exactly do you mean?

89
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,800
What do you say?

90
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:35,680
If you deny the existence of Pegasus in their way, you are affirming the existence of Pegasus.

91
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,400
Mech X makes this point.

92
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:47,000
If Pegasus were not, if Pegasus didn't exist, then we should not be talking about anything

93
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,600
when we say, when we use the word.

94
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:57,720
Therefore, it would be nonsense to say even that Pegasus is not.

95
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,720
Consider the phrase, Pegasus does not exist.

96
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,840
And ask yourself, is this true or is it false?

97
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,080
If you say yes, it is true.

98
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,080
What makes this true?

99
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,840
What makes this true must be meaning.

100
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,320
Truth requires meaning.

101
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,160
Meaning requires reference.

102
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:41,040
If the word Pegasus is meaningful at all, then there must be something that refers to the

103
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,640
name Pegasus.

104
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:54,280
But if there isn't anything to which the word Pegasus refer, then the word Pegasus is meaningless.

105
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:02,000
But if Pegasus, the word Pegasus is meaningless, then the statement Pegasus does not exist

106
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,160
cannot be true.

107
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:12,040
But if it's not true, then it must be false that Pegasus doesn't exist.

108
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,840
But think about it now.

109
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:23,800
If it's false that Pegasus doesn't exist, in order for that sentence to be false, that

110
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,280
implies that Pegasus does exist.

111
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,000
It's a big mess.

112
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,600
So some philosophers like MechEx might respond the following.

113
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,760
Look, Pegasus is an idea, a concept in our minds.

114
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:54,720
So if the word Pegasus is an idea, then the statement Pegasus does not exist.

115
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,480
The idea does not exist.

116
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:06,640
It's false because there is or there isn't a certain Pegasus idea.

117
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:17,600
That's how you make sense of Plato's beard.

118
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:29,280
Now, Quina observes a problem with MechEx's solution.

119
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:38,200
He observes that when I talk about things, I understand there is a distinction between

120
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,960
those things and ideas of those things.

121
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:49,280
So my idea of a table is, call it a brain state.

122
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:55,600
And a table is an existent object in space and time.

123
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,360
However, what about the idea of Pegasus?

124
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,320
When, first of all, when I say that there is Pegasus, an idea of Pegasus, what is the

125
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,720
idea of Pegasus?

126
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:18,400
Probably can't be an idea of some other idea, right?

127
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,080
But in any case, when I talk about Pegasus, I am not talking about an idea.

128
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:31,080
I am talking about a real horse with wings.

129
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:37,280
So when I deny the existence of Pegasus, I'm not denying the existence of the idea of Pegasus.

130
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:43,320
I'm denying the existence of a horse that has wings.

131
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:50,000
Here's another solution to this problem, Plato's beard.

132
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,520
This is Wyman's solution, okay?

133
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:02,960
Wyman observes there are actual things, like tables, dogs, pizzas, buildings.

134
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,520
And there are things that do not exist, but they could exist.

135
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:18,880
For example, dragons, rent-free-for-all, and Pegasus, our Pegasus.

136
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:28,480
Also you have to observe that there are things that could never exist.

137
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:42,440
These for example, like the round square, or a married bachelor, these are absurd.

138
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,040
They are contradictory in terms.

139
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:57,280
There can't be such thing as a square that is also round, or a married person who is

140
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,440
not married, or a non-married person who is married.

141
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,560
Great.

142
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:18,440
So in other words, Wyman's solution is that, to Plato's beard, is that when we say anything

143
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:25,480
about these things like Pegasus, is that Pegasus, we have to say, is something that could exist.

144
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:36,400
So in other words, Pegasus subsists, okay, subsists.

145
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,720
So Pegasus has his being as an actualized possible.

146
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:50,840
So in other words, these are the sphere, the realm of all objects.

147
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:59,000
And there are actual objects, like for example, horses, okay.

148
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,880
There's a subset of the set of all objects that exist.

149
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:16,120
But among the set of objects, there are also objects that could exist, or subsist, like

150
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,240
dragons, like Pegasus, okay.

151
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:27,200
So that's the way we think of these entities.

152
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:37,280
But Quine observes immediately that if we have no principles to exclude possible objects

153
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:44,080
from existence, what principle is there against the existence of a round square, right?

154
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:53,960
If we have to say that Pegasus exists, because it is one of those objects that is contingent,

155
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,160
right?

156
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:05,600
And so it has existence, while it has, in a sense, because it has subsistence.

157
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:15,440
But then, how do we know, how do we make a distinction between things that just subsist,

158
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:22,280
they don't really exist in space and time, they're possible, and they have subsistence.

159
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:30,000
And existence of round squares and Mary bachelors.

160
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,280
I mean, if they don't really exist in actual reality, then what's the rule?

161
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:43,200
Then we can say, if there's no rule, we can say, well, then anything could subsist.

162
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,180
Why do we have to say that round squares cannot subsist?

163
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:54,400
We could say, perhaps, that they do not exist, okay.

164
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:03,320
But we can't say that they cannot subsist, because what are the rules of subsistence?

165
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,600
So it makes it very messy, very, very complicated.

166
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,400
It's better to get rid of this world of subsistence.

167
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:22,240
Furthermore, Quine gives an example.

168
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,000
Take, for example, the possible fat man in the doorway.

169
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,800
And again, the possible bald man in that doorway.

170
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Are they the same possible man, or two possible men?

171
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,280
How do we decide?

172
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:49,840
How can we decide if a possible man or subsistence man, bald man or fat man or whatever, is identical

173
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,440
to another?

174
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,720
It seems that there are no rules of identity in subsistence.

175
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,120
So once again, this is just messy.

176
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:10,200
It's better to abandon this kind of world of subsistence.

177
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:18,600
Now let me talk about another objection.

178
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,880
Another objection is that these ontologies presented by MechEx and Wyman, according to

179
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,120
Quine, commit the fallacy of equivocation.

180
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,600
They equivocate meaning and naming.

181
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:44,240
The fallacy is to assume that just because a term, a word, is meaningful, and it is meaningfully

182
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:54,920
used, it follows that that term must refer to something that really exists.

183
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:05,000
Now this error was already pointed out by Russell's theory of definite description.

184
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,480
And also by Frege, when Frege talks about the meaning, the difference between meaning

185
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
and naming.

186
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:19,800
For example, the evening star and the morning star.

187
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:30,640
The phrase evening star names a planet, the planet Venus, but the morning star names the

188
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:38,960
same object, but the two phrases don't have the same meaning.

189
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,920
They name the same object, but they don't have the same meaning.

190
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:50,440
Otherwise the ancients would have known that they were the same object.

191
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:58,760
That's why they had different names.

192
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:09,600
So Wyman and MechEx confuse the alleged name, the named object Pegasus, with the meaning

193
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,280
of the word Pegasus.

194
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:18,040
Before concluding that Pegasus must be, must exist.

195
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,520
So how do we shave Plato's beard?

196
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,640
Well by using Russell's method.

197
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:36,120
This method says that we have to analyze and translate in illogical form any statement.

198
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:48,960
For example, the statement, there exists a flying winged horse named Pegasus.

199
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:58,480
We translate it with these funny logical operators, which means, you say this inverted

200
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:14,640
E letter means that there exists, there is an X, such that this X, this X is F, it means

201
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,400
it flies.

202
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:33,520
So also the plus sign, this X is winged and also this X is named Pegasus.

203
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:42,200
So now I can shave Plato's beard, I can deny the existence of something without creating

204
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,280
any ambiguities by stating the following.

205
00:23:48,280 --> 00:24:01,800
It is not the case that, or it is not true that, there exists or something is a flying

206
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,480
winged horse named Pegasus.

207
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,880
You see the difference.

208
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,760
Now I don't deny the existence of Pegasus.

209
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:20,240
I deny that there is such a thing as Pegasus, namely an entity that flies, that is an horse,

210
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:27,480
that is winged, and that is named Pegasus.

211
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:34,120
As an alternative I can say, I can rephrase Pegasus as a definite description.

212
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:40,800
For example, the winged horse that was captured by Bellarophon.

213
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:51,000
So I can say it is not the case that there is such an entity and so on.

214
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,560
Now let us turn to the ontological problem of universals.

215
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,320
I have a video lecture for universal, watch that video lecture.

216
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,800
The question whether there are such entities as attributes, relations, classes, numbers,

217
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:17,920
functions, mech X, or people like mech X thinks that there are, speaking of attributes we

218
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:24,480
can say there are red houses, red horses, red sunsets.

219
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,240
Now these houses, roses, and sunsets then have something in common.

220
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:38,280
And this, which they have in common, is all I mean by the attribute of redness.

221
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:44,120
So redness would be something that really exists like Plato's forms, if you remember

222
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,080
from my lecture on Plato.

223
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,840
So the argument would be the following.

224
00:25:50,840 --> 00:26:01,560
We correctly classified red houses, red roses, and red sunsets and as things that have the

225
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:10,600
same color, there must be something, a property that is in common in the world that makes

226
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,720
them belong to the same family.

227
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Or there exists an X that is the shared property of redness, okay?

228
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:33,800
Now, Quine says, one may admit that there are red houses, red roses, sunsets, but deny

229
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,000
that they have anything in common.

230
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:46,640
The word red or red objects denotes each of sundry individual entities, which are red

231
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,960
houses, red roses, red sunsets, and so on.

232
00:26:49,960 --> 00:27:01,680
But there is not in addition any entity whatsoever, individual or red or otherwise, which is named

233
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:07,440
by the word redness.

234
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:17,920
That houses and roses and sunsets are all of them red, may be taken as ultimate and irreducible.

235
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:24,920
In other words, why do we classify all things together as red?

236
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:35,200
Quine says, well, we don't have to postulate redness as an entity or a platonic form.

237
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:42,760
We can just say simply they have a common property, namely redness.

238
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,640
And what is this common property of redness?

239
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:55,600
Quine would say, there are red houses, red roses, and red sunsets end of the story.

240
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:05,280
So in other words, this would be a brute fact, they just resemble.

241
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:12,600
The doctrine that universals are just names without any corresponding reality, and that

242
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,000
only particular objects exist.

243
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:27,120
This is with the doctrine that Quine is endorsing.

244
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,140
So in other words, we just say no to properties.

245
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:38,800
Our commitment to properties isn't informative as an explanation anyway.

246
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:47,600
So Quine says, it doesn't explain anything, it only postulates even more entities.

247
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,520
We can say that they are brute facts, the fact that they resemble, they have something

248
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,200
in common.

249
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,360
Mech X or any other philosopher doesn't have any explanatory power, doesn't offer any

250
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,200
explanatory power.

251
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:18,440
There are all the occult entities that he posits under such names of redness.

252
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:29,600
So what do I gain by saying that there is redness, I don't gain anything.

253
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,000
I can, on the other hand, apply two good principles.

254
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,960
One principle is the Occam's razor.

255
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:45,760
As you know, Occam's razor says, do not multiply entities unnecessarily.

256
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,240
And so Quine is using Occam's razor as a principle.

257
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,560
Why should we multiply entities unnecessarily?

258
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:01,520
When we can just say redness is just a brute fact, all these objects are red.

259
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:08,920
Under the story, why postulating an entity known as red?

260
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:19,840
And this is supposed to minimize brute facts, although it seems that by saying that it is

261
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:26,240
a brute fact, it just adds another brute fact.

262
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,960
But anyway, what about meaning?

263
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,200
Now Mech X argues the following, granted.

264
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:43,000
The description between meaning and naming is fine.

265
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,800
The morning star, the evening star, fine.

266
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:54,240
But let us even grant that Pegasus or red or redness in other such entities are not names

267
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,400
of attributes.

268
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:03,840
Still, you admit they have a meaning.

269
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:13,960
But these meanings, whether they are named or not, are still universal meanings.

270
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:21,160
So we usually get it right when we classify things, read things.

271
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:27,680
Quine and I just arbitrarily assign these names and understand these meanings.

272
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:36,600
So there must be something responsible for our ability to do this and to have meaning.

273
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,480
Quine has nothing against meaning.

274
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:48,880
However, he says, I feel not reluctant toward refusing to admit meanings.

275
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,640
For I do not thereby deny that words and statements are meaningful.

276
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,760
One thing is to say that there is meaning and something is meaningful.

277
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:07,400
I remain free to maintain that the fact that a given linguistic utterance is meaningful

278
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:16,920
or significant, as I prefer to say, is an ultimate irreducible matter of fact.

279
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:26,320
Or I may undertake to analyze it in terms of directly of what people do in the presence

280
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:35,760
of linguistic utterance, a linguistic utterance in question, and other utterances similar

281
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,280
to it.

282
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:44,080
In other words, what Quine is not advocating but he's suggesting, I don't have to say

283
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,400
that there's meaning.

284
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:57,040
I can simply say that explaining in behavioristic terms, saying that something is meaningful

285
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:09,400
because it is a disposition to behave in a certain way with respect to an utterance.

286
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:21,560
For example, some dogs are white and not thereby commit ourselves to recognizing either doghood

287
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,120
or whiteness as entities.

288
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,960
Some dogs are white, says that some things that are dogs are white.

289
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:37,000
And in order that this statement be true, the things over which the bound variable

290
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:46,800
something ranges must include some white dogs but need not include whiteness or dogness.

291
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:56,920
So once again, we can analyze it in a logical way and say that there are some things that

292
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,960
are white and there are dogs.

293
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,600
This is nothing to do with dogness and whiteness.

294
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:14,600
And we can make sense of what we mean by some dogs or many dogs are white.

295
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:22,840
So Quine says that there seem to be three options, Platonism, which I discuss at length

296
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:33,040
in my video on Plato, Plato's metaphysics, which argues that there are abstract entities.

297
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,680
They exist independently of human beings and human minds.

298
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:45,840
The second option is conceptualism, which says that abstract entities exist but only

299
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,560
as concepts in our minds.

300
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,600
And then the third one is nominalism.

301
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:58,680
There are no abstract entities, we just use terms.

302
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,520
How do we decide between them?

303
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:08,480
Well Quine says that we have to decide which one is correct by doing the same thing that

304
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,720
scientists do.

305
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,920
What do they do?

306
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:21,240
We posit some hypotheses and then we test these hypotheses by making decisions based

307
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,840
on theoretical principles.

308
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:33,600
For example, simplicity, which one is more simple, is simpler or is the simplest?

309
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:40,400
The better hypothesis is the simpler one or the simplest.

310
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:49,680
Usefulness, so the better hypothesis is the one that is useful, that explains more, that

311
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:59,720
has greater predictive power and explanatory power and also coherence.

312
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,600
The better hypothesis is the one that is more coherent.

313
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:14,440
It does not conflict with other truths that we accept, that we have already established

314
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:23,760
and we hold as true and we have strong reasons to believe to be true.

315
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,640
Quine, by the way, prefers nominalism.

316
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:35,040
Mathematicians could deny, for example, that there is a prime number greater than 10, yet

317
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:46,200
find it useful, very useful to act as if numbers existed.

318
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,800
So what is the conclusion?

319
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,960
Well the conclusion is rather inconclusive.

320
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:59,680
The question of what ontology actually to adopt, Quine says, still stands open.

321
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:09,320
Let us by all means see how much of a physicalistic conceptual scheme can be reduced to a phenomenalistic

322
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,440
one.

323
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:18,840
Viewed from within the phenomenalistic conceptual scheme, the ontologies of physical objects

324
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:23,480
and mathematical objects are myths.

325
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,400
The quality of the myth, however, is relative.

326
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:34,840
Moving in this case to the epistemological point of view, this point of view is one among

327
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:41,400
various corresponding to one among our various interests and purposes.

328
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:49,240
In other words, what is there to answer the original question at the outset?

329
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,560
What is there?

330
00:37:50,560 --> 00:38:00,440
What is there is, we don't really know ultimately what is there, but we have to commit only

331
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:11,200
to those entities that can pass the logical test.

332
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:21,000
These that pass the logical test and we cannot speculate that these things really exist.

333
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,360
Some of these things really exist.

334
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:31,600
Some of these things are objects that exist in a nominal sense, in a useful sense, for

335
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,800
example, mathematical objects.

336
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:44,880
So as long as they contribute to some meaning and understanding of other things in the world.

337
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:57,880
So Quine sums up that his applications of Russell's method to Plato rules out the reasoning

338
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,320
behind some ontologies.

339
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,840
So we can discard some ontologies, a linguistic subject does not entail the existence of a

340
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,880
corresponding abstract entity, for example, Pegasus.

341
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,000
We can make sense of Pegasus, we can deny the existence of Pegasus without creating

342
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,800
any problems.

343
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:26,640
Now Quine suggests that we continue to pursue our ontologies in an open-minded and experimental

344
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,640
spirit.

345
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,440
So in sum, the question, what is there?

346
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:42,520
Quine responds, I don't know, but Quine can't infer the existence of a certain abstract entity

347
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:49,600
or entities, ideas, universal meanings, via Plato's beard.

348
00:39:49,600 --> 00:40:01,960
Quine himself, then as I said, is a materialist when it comes to ontology, arguing that although

349
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:10,840
abstract entities exist in a certain sense, they were not mental.

350
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:22,440
They exist in a sense that we can regard them as useful, the useful entities.

351
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:31,040
If they ultimately exist, we don't know, but we don't have to commit to their existence.

352
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,760
And this is the end of another video lecture.

353
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,840
Thank you for watching, I'll see you next time.
