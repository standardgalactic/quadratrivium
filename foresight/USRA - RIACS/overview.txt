1. The step size in quantum optimization algorithms (like QAOA) is analogous to the classical learning rate. In the QAOA framework, this step size can be adjusted by modifying the hyperparameters that determine how much the system's parameters are updated after a single iteration of applying the Hamiltonian corresponding to the cost function and the mixing chamber.
2. The learning rate in the quantum version (QDD) becomes the product of both the classical learning rate and the strength of the phase kicks applied to the wavefunction. This allows for a seamless connection between classical optimization methods and their quantum counterparts.
3. To optimize these hyperparameters, you can use meta-learning techniques, where the optimizer itself is being optimized. This can be done by encoding a superposition of different hyperparameters and neural network configurations and then performing gradient descent over this space. This method effectively allows for the exploration of a large number of possibilities simultaneously within a single training run, which can lead to more efficient optimization processes.
