1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Yet another Nobel Prize winner has been caught with some dodgy looking stuff in his papers.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,240
The person I'm talking about is called Thomas Soudoff, a German American neuroscientist at

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,080
Stanford. Now we'll get to the suspect looking stuff in his papers in a second,

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,560
but first I want to give you a bit of background to Soudoff himself,

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,160
talk about his Nobel Prize because I think his research, at least as a psychologist,

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,360
is pretty interesting. So in 2013, Thomas Soudoff won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine,

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,080
along with his colleagues Rothman and Scheckman, for their work on something called

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,800
vesicle trafficking. What the heck does that mean? So basically imagine these are two different

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,920
neurons in your body. Between each neuron in your body, there is a little gap. So when this

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,200
neuron wants to send a message to this neuron, it needs to find a way to send a signal across that

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,680
little gap. We call that gap a synapse. So when this neuron wants to send a signal to this neuron

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,560
across the synapse, it uses these little balloons of fat that it has inside its body, which are

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,440
filled with various different chemicals, which we call neurotransmitters. And so when it needs to

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,200
send a signal, those balloons of fat fuse with the surface of this neuron, releasing the neurotransmitters,

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,920
stuff like dopamine or endorphins, which you've probably heard of before, which then tells this

16
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,560
neuron to fire. And essentially Soudoff and his colleagues discovered that this process

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,120
is controlled by calcium, and also something which they discovered, which they called snare

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,600
proteins. And the discovery of these mechanisms come with a lot of different implications for

19
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,920
various different psychiatric disorders, like depression disorder, anxiety disorder,

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,880
potentially autism. So that's a bit of background on Soudoff's Nobel Prize. And as you can imagine,

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,280
being a prominent scientist like this, winning a Nobel Prize comes with a lot of perks. Soudoff

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,160
currently is a professor at Stanford at a place where the average salary for professors is 200,000

23
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,080
a year. And I imagine Soudoff is owning a healthy amount more than that, given he's a Nobel Prize

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,480
winner. And Soudoff is also on a bunch of other companies who do work related to his research,

25
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,360
including one called Sanofi, which according to this website, earns him another healthy

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,040
$150,000 a year. Now, so Soudoff is very successful. And I've absolutely no problem with that. I

27
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,560
think that scientists who do great work should be paid well and should be successful because,

28
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,720
of course, we want to incentivize scientists to make cool discoveries and do impactful work.

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,360
However, what we don't want are scientists cheating in order to have that success. Now,

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,640
I'm not directly accusing Soudoff of cheating here. But as of the time of filming, there are 35

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,160
of Soudoff's papers that have been flagged on a website called Pubpeer, which if you're

32
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,440
unfamiliar, is a website where fellow scientists can critique other scientists' work and point

33
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,200
out things that they think need to be addressed. Unsurprisingly, the person who has found the

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,160
most anomalies in Soudoff's work is friend of the channel, Elizabeth Bick. Bick has found

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,600
multiple instances of duplications of images and just images that don't look right in her opinion.

36
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,840
So I'm going to go through a couple of different examples. This first one is a 2012 paper from

37
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,240
Soudoff and his colleagues. This image seems to be the result of some kind of fluorescence

38
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,520
microscopy. It's showing aggregations of a protein called alpha synuclein, which I believe

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,320
is a protein that is associated with Parkinson's. I think I'm not an expert by any means, but I

40
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,600
think the way this works is that the clumpier your alpha synuclein, the more neurons die,

41
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,160
and the worse your Parkinson's is. So I believe each box in this figure is supposed to represent a

42
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,200
different mutation of alpha synuclein. So each box should be unique and completely different to

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,000
each other. But as you can see from the two areas highlighted in yellow, these sections of the boxes

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,680
are identical, but rotated 90 degrees. And also the two areas in purple are identical as well,

45
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,960
but rotated 180 degrees. So that looks pretty dodgy, right? How did that happen? Are the authors

46
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,720
trying to make their results look different to how they actually are? Well, according to the

47
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,840
authors of the paper, it was an honest copy and pasting error. Jacqueline Burr, who's the first

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,080
named author on this paper, said that, yeah, it was some kind of copy and pasting error,

49
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,000
something about the images were on a PowerPoint and they had to crop them and paste them and they

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,560
cropped the wrong one or something. And then she posted a corrected file. Okay, so that looked

51
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,800
pretty dodgy, but the interaction was at least, you know, pretty cordial between Elizabeth Bick

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,520
and Jacqueline. Nothing too heated going on there. However, when it comes to Soudof himself,

53
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,800
his responses to Elizabeth Bick have been less than cordial, should we say? If we take a look

54
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,360
at this latest pub peer post by Elizabeth Bick, this was just posted a week before the time of

55
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,760
filming. This paper came out in 2010 in one of nature's journals, specifically nature, structural

56
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,640
and molecular biology, which is a pretty prestigious journal. And as you can see, there's again

57
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:28,720
examples of image duplication, the rectangles in the same colors are identical. So as you can see,

58
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,320
there are three orange rectangles, three red rectangles, etc, etc. You can see there's lots

59
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,280
of duplicated areas within this image. Now that is something which is concerning in a western

60
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,000
blot image like this. And Soudof's reply was a little defensive. He goes, thanks, I'm trying to

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,880
understand the accusation here, that within digitally reproduced images of immunoblot stripes

62
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,760
that are clearly not stitched, and were reproduced from non digital data at low resolution, contain

63
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,600
tiny areas that are unexpectedly similar, i.e. intentionally manipulated, whereas the bands

64
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,360
themselves are not manipulated. I'm just trying to figure out what Dr. Bick's AI powered software

65
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,920
mining our old papers may have found. This is such a bizarre accusation. So essentially, Soudof is

66
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:20,320
blaming these visual artifacts on the fact that the image is low resolution, which is complete

67
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,360
nonsense in my opinion. And that is also the opinion of another pub peer poster, who said,

68
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,800
figure S6B contains rectangular regions that are perfect clones of each other. This cannot have

69
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,520
happened by chance, as in much much less than 10 to the power of 986. And blaming this on a

70
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,280
reproduction artifact of a digitized image is as believable as saying the dog ate my homework.

71
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,320
In a much cooler tone, Elizabeth Bick also replied to Thomas Soudof's comment by saying,

72
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,160
Dr. Soudof, I am not accusing anyone of anything, but I am trying to find a reasonable explanation

73
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,360
for these unexpected areas. As I am sure you will know in western blots, the bands are the only

74
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,920
type of results. Negative lanes are of equal importance since they show a lack of expression

75
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,840
of the protein of interest, as is the case here. If you don't understand what that means, maybe

76
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,920
this is the first Pete Judo video that you're watching. The way that western blots work is that

77
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,960
they show bigger blots if that protein is more present in your sample. So the bigger, darker,

78
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,960
and thicker the blot, the more present that protein is. And if there's no blot, that means that

79
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,200
that protein isn't present in your sample. So Elizabeth Bick is pointing out here that just

80
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,280
because the blot itself was not duplicated doesn't mean that this isn't important.

81
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,040
The fact that this negative space has these clear duplications indicates that perhaps there was

82
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,400
something there before that has now been covered up, or perhaps this image was manufactured artificially,

83
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,880
and therefore these visual artifacts are being discovered. And then at the end of the comment,

84
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,920
Elizabeth Bick kind of drops the mic on Soudof and says, also, I found these regions by eye.

85
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,400
And actually, it's quite ironic that Soudof is making fun of AI algorithms in this case,

86
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,640
because if anyone has used a dodgy AI to produce their work here, it's Soudof's colleagues most

87
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,800
likely. This looks like something that might happen as a result of some kind of western blot

88
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,120
image generating AI, or it could just be somebody messing around with Photoshop,

89
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,880
either the author themselves or somebody that they paid. Either way, these kind of visual

90
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,000
artifacts should never be found in legitimate western blots. And so this looks really dodgy.

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,240
And in my opinion, I don't think that Soudof's reply is particularly convincing or that he's

92
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,960
handled the situation very well at all. So those are just two examples of the anomalies that are

93
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,440
coming out about Soudof's work. And there seems to be a couple of new ones every week recently.

94
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,160
Like I said, there are now 35 papers being looked at as having suspicious stuff in them.

95
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,920
And actually one of Soudof's papers has already been retracted. This is the paper. It's a 2023

96
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:45,360
paper that was published in PNAS. That's PNAS. No jokes in the comments, please. So the reason

97
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,520
why this PNAS paper was retracted is because there's a bunch of fake data in it. Here are some

98
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,000
examples of the data that was called out by people on Pope here. As you can see, the two areas in

99
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,560
green show exactly the same numbers, the exact same measurements for two different experimental

100
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,240
conditions. The chance of that happening in reality is basically impossible, especially not in exactly

101
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,600
the same order. Same here with the numbers in blue. Same here with the numbers in cyan and

102
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,360
the ones in pink as well. This didn't just happen once in the paper, but happened multiple times.

103
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,600
As you can see, there's another set of numbers here in the experimental condition on the left.

104
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,280
These numbers are all grouped together on the ones on the right. There seems to be a few random

105
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,720
numbers. I don't know if the author was trying to throw people off and trying to make it look like

106
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,280
they weren't cheating when they obviously were. So there's clearly some dodgy stuff going on here.

107
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,760
Why do the numbers look like this? This kind of exact duplication of numbers in the same sequence

108
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,320
is impossible. It's clearly being manipulated by somebody. So because this paper looks so dodgy,

109
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,080
the raw data was independently analyzed by another scientist at Stanford, a guy called Dr. Daniel

110
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:50,240
Martis. And as a result, the paper has now been retracted from PNAS. Fake data. It's back again.

111
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,480
So with one retraction under his belt and over 30 papers now under investigation,

112
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,360
it is not looking good for Dr. Sudov. But establishing intent and who in each of these

113
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,200
cases actually did the cheating or honest mistaking is a lot harder to establish. In my opinion,

114
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,000
it seems highly unlikely that Dr. Sudov himself was the one who was doing any of this stuff.

115
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,120
As the final author on the paper and as a scientist of his caliber,

116
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,600
he's likely just there at an advisory role meeting with the students and postdocs who are

117
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,600
working with him who actually do all the legwork for each of these papers. But nevertheless,

118
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,360
it still doesn't look good to have so many papers with your name on it that have these

119
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,280
kind of anomalies coming up. So let me know what you think of this Sudov situation in the

120
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:40,560
comments below. Thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you in the next one. Bye bye.
