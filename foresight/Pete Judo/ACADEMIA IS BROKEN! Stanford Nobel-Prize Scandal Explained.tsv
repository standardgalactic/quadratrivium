0	5440	Yet another Nobel Prize winner has been caught with some dodgy looking stuff in his papers.
5440	10240	The person I'm talking about is called Thomas Soudoff, a German American neuroscientist at
10240	14080	Stanford. Now we'll get to the suspect looking stuff in his papers in a second,
14080	16560	but first I want to give you a bit of background to Soudoff himself,
16560	20160	talk about his Nobel Prize because I think his research, at least as a psychologist,
20160	25360	is pretty interesting. So in 2013, Thomas Soudoff won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine,
25360	30080	along with his colleagues Rothman and Scheckman, for their work on something called
30080	34800	vesicle trafficking. What the heck does that mean? So basically imagine these are two different
34800	39920	neurons in your body. Between each neuron in your body, there is a little gap. So when this
39920	45200	neuron wants to send a message to this neuron, it needs to find a way to send a signal across that
45200	49680	little gap. We call that gap a synapse. So when this neuron wants to send a signal to this neuron
49680	54560	across the synapse, it uses these little balloons of fat that it has inside its body, which are
54560	59440	filled with various different chemicals, which we call neurotransmitters. And so when it needs to
59440	65200	send a signal, those balloons of fat fuse with the surface of this neuron, releasing the neurotransmitters,
65200	69920	stuff like dopamine or endorphins, which you've probably heard of before, which then tells this
69920	74560	neuron to fire. And essentially Soudoff and his colleagues discovered that this process
74560	79120	is controlled by calcium, and also something which they discovered, which they called snare
79120	83600	proteins. And the discovery of these mechanisms come with a lot of different implications for
83600	87920	various different psychiatric disorders, like depression disorder, anxiety disorder,
87920	92880	potentially autism. So that's a bit of background on Soudoff's Nobel Prize. And as you can imagine,
92880	97280	being a prominent scientist like this, winning a Nobel Prize comes with a lot of perks. Soudoff
97280	102160	currently is a professor at Stanford at a place where the average salary for professors is 200,000
102160	106080	a year. And I imagine Soudoff is owning a healthy amount more than that, given he's a Nobel Prize
106080	110480	winner. And Soudoff is also on a bunch of other companies who do work related to his research,
110480	115360	including one called Sanofi, which according to this website, earns him another healthy
115360	121040	$150,000 a year. Now, so Soudoff is very successful. And I've absolutely no problem with that. I
121040	124560	think that scientists who do great work should be paid well and should be successful because,
124560	128720	of course, we want to incentivize scientists to make cool discoveries and do impactful work.
128720	133360	However, what we don't want are scientists cheating in order to have that success. Now,
133360	138640	I'm not directly accusing Soudoff of cheating here. But as of the time of filming, there are 35
138640	142160	of Soudoff's papers that have been flagged on a website called Pubpeer, which if you're
142160	147440	unfamiliar, is a website where fellow scientists can critique other scientists' work and point
147440	151200	out things that they think need to be addressed. Unsurprisingly, the person who has found the
151200	156160	most anomalies in Soudoff's work is friend of the channel, Elizabeth Bick. Bick has found
156160	161600	multiple instances of duplications of images and just images that don't look right in her opinion.
161600	165840	So I'm going to go through a couple of different examples. This first one is a 2012 paper from
165840	170240	Soudoff and his colleagues. This image seems to be the result of some kind of fluorescence
170240	175520	microscopy. It's showing aggregations of a protein called alpha synuclein, which I believe
175520	180320	is a protein that is associated with Parkinson's. I think I'm not an expert by any means, but I
180320	185600	think the way this works is that the clumpier your alpha synuclein, the more neurons die,
185600	190160	and the worse your Parkinson's is. So I believe each box in this figure is supposed to represent a
190160	195200	different mutation of alpha synuclein. So each box should be unique and completely different to
195200	200000	each other. But as you can see from the two areas highlighted in yellow, these sections of the boxes
200000	205680	are identical, but rotated 90 degrees. And also the two areas in purple are identical as well,
205680	210960	but rotated 180 degrees. So that looks pretty dodgy, right? How did that happen? Are the authors
210960	214720	trying to make their results look different to how they actually are? Well, according to the
214720	219840	authors of the paper, it was an honest copy and pasting error. Jacqueline Burr, who's the first
219840	224080	named author on this paper, said that, yeah, it was some kind of copy and pasting error,
224080	228000	something about the images were on a PowerPoint and they had to crop them and paste them and they
228000	232560	cropped the wrong one or something. And then she posted a corrected file. Okay, so that looked
232560	236800	pretty dodgy, but the interaction was at least, you know, pretty cordial between Elizabeth Bick
236800	241520	and Jacqueline. Nothing too heated going on there. However, when it comes to Soudof himself,
241520	246800	his responses to Elizabeth Bick have been less than cordial, should we say? If we take a look
246800	251360	at this latest pub peer post by Elizabeth Bick, this was just posted a week before the time of
251360	257760	filming. This paper came out in 2010 in one of nature's journals, specifically nature, structural
257760	262640	and molecular biology, which is a pretty prestigious journal. And as you can see, there's again
262640	268720	examples of image duplication, the rectangles in the same colors are identical. So as you can see,
268720	274320	there are three orange rectangles, three red rectangles, etc, etc. You can see there's lots
274320	279280	of duplicated areas within this image. Now that is something which is concerning in a western
279280	286000	blot image like this. And Soudof's reply was a little defensive. He goes, thanks, I'm trying to
286000	290880	understand the accusation here, that within digitally reproduced images of immunoblot stripes
290880	295760	that are clearly not stitched, and were reproduced from non digital data at low resolution, contain
295760	301600	tiny areas that are unexpectedly similar, i.e. intentionally manipulated, whereas the bands
301600	307360	themselves are not manipulated. I'm just trying to figure out what Dr. Bick's AI powered software
307360	313920	mining our old papers may have found. This is such a bizarre accusation. So essentially, Soudof is
313920	320320	blaming these visual artifacts on the fact that the image is low resolution, which is complete
320320	325360	nonsense in my opinion. And that is also the opinion of another pub peer poster, who said,
325360	332800	figure S6B contains rectangular regions that are perfect clones of each other. This cannot have
332800	339520	happened by chance, as in much much less than 10 to the power of 986. And blaming this on a
339520	345280	reproduction artifact of a digitized image is as believable as saying the dog ate my homework.
345280	350320	In a much cooler tone, Elizabeth Bick also replied to Thomas Soudof's comment by saying,
350320	356160	Dr. Soudof, I am not accusing anyone of anything, but I am trying to find a reasonable explanation
356160	361360	for these unexpected areas. As I am sure you will know in western blots, the bands are the only
361360	365920	type of results. Negative lanes are of equal importance since they show a lack of expression
365920	369840	of the protein of interest, as is the case here. If you don't understand what that means, maybe
369840	373920	this is the first Pete Judo video that you're watching. The way that western blots work is that
373920	378960	they show bigger blots if that protein is more present in your sample. So the bigger, darker,
378960	382960	and thicker the blot, the more present that protein is. And if there's no blot, that means that
382960	387200	that protein isn't present in your sample. So Elizabeth Bick is pointing out here that just
387280	391280	because the blot itself was not duplicated doesn't mean that this isn't important.
391280	395040	The fact that this negative space has these clear duplications indicates that perhaps there was
395040	400400	something there before that has now been covered up, or perhaps this image was manufactured artificially,
400400	404880	and therefore these visual artifacts are being discovered. And then at the end of the comment,
404880	409920	Elizabeth Bick kind of drops the mic on Soudof and says, also, I found these regions by eye.
409920	414400	And actually, it's quite ironic that Soudof is making fun of AI algorithms in this case,
414400	418640	because if anyone has used a dodgy AI to produce their work here, it's Soudof's colleagues most
418640	422800	likely. This looks like something that might happen as a result of some kind of western blot
422800	427120	image generating AI, or it could just be somebody messing around with Photoshop,
427120	430880	either the author themselves or somebody that they paid. Either way, these kind of visual
430880	436000	artifacts should never be found in legitimate western blots. And so this looks really dodgy.
436000	440240	And in my opinion, I don't think that Soudof's reply is particularly convincing or that he's
440240	444960	handled the situation very well at all. So those are just two examples of the anomalies that are
444960	449440	coming out about Soudof's work. And there seems to be a couple of new ones every week recently.
449440	454160	Like I said, there are now 35 papers being looked at as having suspicious stuff in them.
454160	459920	And actually one of Soudof's papers has already been retracted. This is the paper. It's a 2023
459920	465360	paper that was published in PNAS. That's PNAS. No jokes in the comments, please. So the reason
465360	469520	why this PNAS paper was retracted is because there's a bunch of fake data in it. Here are some
469600	474000	examples of the data that was called out by people on Pope here. As you can see, the two areas in
474000	478560	green show exactly the same numbers, the exact same measurements for two different experimental
478560	484240	conditions. The chance of that happening in reality is basically impossible, especially not in exactly
484240	489600	the same order. Same here with the numbers in blue. Same here with the numbers in cyan and
489600	493360	the ones in pink as well. This didn't just happen once in the paper, but happened multiple times.
493360	497600	As you can see, there's another set of numbers here in the experimental condition on the left.
497600	501280	These numbers are all grouped together on the ones on the right. There seems to be a few random
501280	504720	numbers. I don't know if the author was trying to throw people off and trying to make it look like
504720	509280	they weren't cheating when they obviously were. So there's clearly some dodgy stuff going on here.
509280	513760	Why do the numbers look like this? This kind of exact duplication of numbers in the same sequence
513760	518320	is impossible. It's clearly being manipulated by somebody. So because this paper looks so dodgy,
518320	524080	the raw data was independently analyzed by another scientist at Stanford, a guy called Dr. Daniel
524080	530240	Martis. And as a result, the paper has now been retracted from PNAS. Fake data. It's back again.
530240	534480	So with one retraction under his belt and over 30 papers now under investigation,
534480	539360	it is not looking good for Dr. Sudov. But establishing intent and who in each of these
539360	545200	cases actually did the cheating or honest mistaking is a lot harder to establish. In my opinion,
545200	550000	it seems highly unlikely that Dr. Sudov himself was the one who was doing any of this stuff.
550000	553120	As the final author on the paper and as a scientist of his caliber,
553120	557600	he's likely just there at an advisory role meeting with the students and postdocs who are
557600	561600	working with him who actually do all the legwork for each of these papers. But nevertheless,
561600	565360	it still doesn't look good to have so many papers with your name on it that have these
565360	569280	kind of anomalies coming up. So let me know what you think of this Sudov situation in the
569280	580560	comments below. Thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you in the next one. Bye bye.
