00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
Yet another Nobel Prize winner has been caught with some dodgy looking stuff in his papers.

00:05.440 --> 00:10.240
The person I'm talking about is called Thomas Soudoff, a German American neuroscientist at

00:10.240 --> 00:14.080
Stanford. Now we'll get to the suspect looking stuff in his papers in a second,

00:14.080 --> 00:16.560
but first I want to give you a bit of background to Soudoff himself,

00:16.560 --> 00:20.160
talk about his Nobel Prize because I think his research, at least as a psychologist,

00:20.160 --> 00:25.360
is pretty interesting. So in 2013, Thomas Soudoff won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine,

00:25.360 --> 00:30.080
along with his colleagues Rothman and Scheckman, for their work on something called

00:30.080 --> 00:34.800
vesicle trafficking. What the heck does that mean? So basically imagine these are two different

00:34.800 --> 00:39.920
neurons in your body. Between each neuron in your body, there is a little gap. So when this

00:39.920 --> 00:45.200
neuron wants to send a message to this neuron, it needs to find a way to send a signal across that

00:45.200 --> 00:49.680
little gap. We call that gap a synapse. So when this neuron wants to send a signal to this neuron

00:49.680 --> 00:54.560
across the synapse, it uses these little balloons of fat that it has inside its body, which are

00:54.560 --> 00:59.440
filled with various different chemicals, which we call neurotransmitters. And so when it needs to

00:59.440 --> 01:05.200
send a signal, those balloons of fat fuse with the surface of this neuron, releasing the neurotransmitters,

01:05.200 --> 01:09.920
stuff like dopamine or endorphins, which you've probably heard of before, which then tells this

01:09.920 --> 01:14.560
neuron to fire. And essentially Soudoff and his colleagues discovered that this process

01:14.560 --> 01:19.120
is controlled by calcium, and also something which they discovered, which they called snare

01:19.120 --> 01:23.600
proteins. And the discovery of these mechanisms come with a lot of different implications for

01:23.600 --> 01:27.920
various different psychiatric disorders, like depression disorder, anxiety disorder,

01:27.920 --> 01:32.880
potentially autism. So that's a bit of background on Soudoff's Nobel Prize. And as you can imagine,

01:32.880 --> 01:37.280
being a prominent scientist like this, winning a Nobel Prize comes with a lot of perks. Soudoff

01:37.280 --> 01:42.160
currently is a professor at Stanford at a place where the average salary for professors is 200,000

01:42.160 --> 01:46.080
a year. And I imagine Soudoff is owning a healthy amount more than that, given he's a Nobel Prize

01:46.080 --> 01:50.480
winner. And Soudoff is also on a bunch of other companies who do work related to his research,

01:50.480 --> 01:55.360
including one called Sanofi, which according to this website, earns him another healthy

01:55.360 --> 02:01.040
$150,000 a year. Now, so Soudoff is very successful. And I've absolutely no problem with that. I

02:01.040 --> 02:04.560
think that scientists who do great work should be paid well and should be successful because,

02:04.560 --> 02:08.720
of course, we want to incentivize scientists to make cool discoveries and do impactful work.

02:08.720 --> 02:13.360
However, what we don't want are scientists cheating in order to have that success. Now,

02:13.360 --> 02:18.640
I'm not directly accusing Soudoff of cheating here. But as of the time of filming, there are 35

02:18.640 --> 02:22.160
of Soudoff's papers that have been flagged on a website called Pubpeer, which if you're

02:22.160 --> 02:27.440
unfamiliar, is a website where fellow scientists can critique other scientists' work and point

02:27.440 --> 02:31.200
out things that they think need to be addressed. Unsurprisingly, the person who has found the

02:31.200 --> 02:36.160
most anomalies in Soudoff's work is friend of the channel, Elizabeth Bick. Bick has found

02:36.160 --> 02:41.600
multiple instances of duplications of images and just images that don't look right in her opinion.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.840
So I'm going to go through a couple of different examples. This first one is a 2012 paper from

02:45.840 --> 02:50.240
Soudoff and his colleagues. This image seems to be the result of some kind of fluorescence

02:50.240 --> 02:55.520
microscopy. It's showing aggregations of a protein called alpha synuclein, which I believe

02:55.520 --> 03:00.320
is a protein that is associated with Parkinson's. I think I'm not an expert by any means, but I

03:00.320 --> 03:05.600
think the way this works is that the clumpier your alpha synuclein, the more neurons die,

03:05.600 --> 03:10.160
and the worse your Parkinson's is. So I believe each box in this figure is supposed to represent a

03:10.160 --> 03:15.200
different mutation of alpha synuclein. So each box should be unique and completely different to

03:15.200 --> 03:20.000
each other. But as you can see from the two areas highlighted in yellow, these sections of the boxes

03:20.000 --> 03:25.680
are identical, but rotated 90 degrees. And also the two areas in purple are identical as well,

03:25.680 --> 03:30.960
but rotated 180 degrees. So that looks pretty dodgy, right? How did that happen? Are the authors

03:30.960 --> 03:34.720
trying to make their results look different to how they actually are? Well, according to the

03:34.720 --> 03:39.840
authors of the paper, it was an honest copy and pasting error. Jacqueline Burr, who's the first

03:39.840 --> 03:44.080
named author on this paper, said that, yeah, it was some kind of copy and pasting error,

03:44.080 --> 03:48.000
something about the images were on a PowerPoint and they had to crop them and paste them and they

03:48.000 --> 03:52.560
cropped the wrong one or something. And then she posted a corrected file. Okay, so that looked

03:52.560 --> 03:56.800
pretty dodgy, but the interaction was at least, you know, pretty cordial between Elizabeth Bick

03:56.800 --> 04:01.520
and Jacqueline. Nothing too heated going on there. However, when it comes to Soudof himself,

04:01.520 --> 04:06.800
his responses to Elizabeth Bick have been less than cordial, should we say? If we take a look

04:06.800 --> 04:11.360
at this latest pub peer post by Elizabeth Bick, this was just posted a week before the time of

04:11.360 --> 04:17.760
filming. This paper came out in 2010 in one of nature's journals, specifically nature, structural

04:17.760 --> 04:22.640
and molecular biology, which is a pretty prestigious journal. And as you can see, there's again

04:22.640 --> 04:28.720
examples of image duplication, the rectangles in the same colors are identical. So as you can see,

04:28.720 --> 04:34.320
there are three orange rectangles, three red rectangles, etc, etc. You can see there's lots

04:34.320 --> 04:39.280
of duplicated areas within this image. Now that is something which is concerning in a western

04:39.280 --> 04:46.000
blot image like this. And Soudof's reply was a little defensive. He goes, thanks, I'm trying to

04:46.000 --> 04:50.880
understand the accusation here, that within digitally reproduced images of immunoblot stripes

04:50.880 --> 04:55.760
that are clearly not stitched, and were reproduced from non digital data at low resolution, contain

04:55.760 --> 05:01.600
tiny areas that are unexpectedly similar, i.e. intentionally manipulated, whereas the bands

05:01.600 --> 05:07.360
themselves are not manipulated. I'm just trying to figure out what Dr. Bick's AI powered software

05:07.360 --> 05:13.920
mining our old papers may have found. This is such a bizarre accusation. So essentially, Soudof is

05:13.920 --> 05:20.320
blaming these visual artifacts on the fact that the image is low resolution, which is complete

05:20.320 --> 05:25.360
nonsense in my opinion. And that is also the opinion of another pub peer poster, who said,

05:25.360 --> 05:32.800
figure S6B contains rectangular regions that are perfect clones of each other. This cannot have

05:32.800 --> 05:39.520
happened by chance, as in much much less than 10 to the power of 986. And blaming this on a

05:39.520 --> 05:45.280
reproduction artifact of a digitized image is as believable as saying the dog ate my homework.

05:45.280 --> 05:50.320
In a much cooler tone, Elizabeth Bick also replied to Thomas Soudof's comment by saying,

05:50.320 --> 05:56.160
Dr. Soudof, I am not accusing anyone of anything, but I am trying to find a reasonable explanation

05:56.160 --> 06:01.360
for these unexpected areas. As I am sure you will know in western blots, the bands are the only

06:01.360 --> 06:05.920
type of results. Negative lanes are of equal importance since they show a lack of expression

06:05.920 --> 06:09.840
of the protein of interest, as is the case here. If you don't understand what that means, maybe

06:09.840 --> 06:13.920
this is the first Pete Judo video that you're watching. The way that western blots work is that

06:13.920 --> 06:18.960
they show bigger blots if that protein is more present in your sample. So the bigger, darker,

06:18.960 --> 06:22.960
and thicker the blot, the more present that protein is. And if there's no blot, that means that

06:22.960 --> 06:27.200
that protein isn't present in your sample. So Elizabeth Bick is pointing out here that just

06:27.280 --> 06:31.280
because the blot itself was not duplicated doesn't mean that this isn't important.

06:31.280 --> 06:35.040
The fact that this negative space has these clear duplications indicates that perhaps there was

06:35.040 --> 06:40.400
something there before that has now been covered up, or perhaps this image was manufactured artificially,

06:40.400 --> 06:44.880
and therefore these visual artifacts are being discovered. And then at the end of the comment,

06:44.880 --> 06:49.920
Elizabeth Bick kind of drops the mic on Soudof and says, also, I found these regions by eye.

06:49.920 --> 06:54.400
And actually, it's quite ironic that Soudof is making fun of AI algorithms in this case,

06:54.400 --> 06:58.640
because if anyone has used a dodgy AI to produce their work here, it's Soudof's colleagues most

06:58.640 --> 07:02.800
likely. This looks like something that might happen as a result of some kind of western blot

07:02.800 --> 07:07.120
image generating AI, or it could just be somebody messing around with Photoshop,

07:07.120 --> 07:10.880
either the author themselves or somebody that they paid. Either way, these kind of visual

07:10.880 --> 07:16.000
artifacts should never be found in legitimate western blots. And so this looks really dodgy.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.240
And in my opinion, I don't think that Soudof's reply is particularly convincing or that he's

07:20.240 --> 07:24.960
handled the situation very well at all. So those are just two examples of the anomalies that are

07:24.960 --> 07:29.440
coming out about Soudof's work. And there seems to be a couple of new ones every week recently.

07:29.440 --> 07:34.160
Like I said, there are now 35 papers being looked at as having suspicious stuff in them.

07:34.160 --> 07:39.920
And actually one of Soudof's papers has already been retracted. This is the paper. It's a 2023

07:39.920 --> 07:45.360
paper that was published in PNAS. That's PNAS. No jokes in the comments, please. So the reason

07:45.360 --> 07:49.520
why this PNAS paper was retracted is because there's a bunch of fake data in it. Here are some

07:49.600 --> 07:54.000
examples of the data that was called out by people on Pope here. As you can see, the two areas in

07:54.000 --> 07:58.560
green show exactly the same numbers, the exact same measurements for two different experimental

07:58.560 --> 08:04.240
conditions. The chance of that happening in reality is basically impossible, especially not in exactly

08:04.240 --> 08:09.600
the same order. Same here with the numbers in blue. Same here with the numbers in cyan and

08:09.600 --> 08:13.360
the ones in pink as well. This didn't just happen once in the paper, but happened multiple times.

08:13.360 --> 08:17.600
As you can see, there's another set of numbers here in the experimental condition on the left.

08:17.600 --> 08:21.280
These numbers are all grouped together on the ones on the right. There seems to be a few random

08:21.280 --> 08:24.720
numbers. I don't know if the author was trying to throw people off and trying to make it look like

08:24.720 --> 08:29.280
they weren't cheating when they obviously were. So there's clearly some dodgy stuff going on here.

08:29.280 --> 08:33.760
Why do the numbers look like this? This kind of exact duplication of numbers in the same sequence

08:33.760 --> 08:38.320
is impossible. It's clearly being manipulated by somebody. So because this paper looks so dodgy,

08:38.320 --> 08:44.080
the raw data was independently analyzed by another scientist at Stanford, a guy called Dr. Daniel

08:44.080 --> 08:50.240
Martis. And as a result, the paper has now been retracted from PNAS. Fake data. It's back again.

08:50.240 --> 08:54.480
So with one retraction under his belt and over 30 papers now under investigation,

08:54.480 --> 08:59.360
it is not looking good for Dr. Sudov. But establishing intent and who in each of these

08:59.360 --> 09:05.200
cases actually did the cheating or honest mistaking is a lot harder to establish. In my opinion,

09:05.200 --> 09:10.000
it seems highly unlikely that Dr. Sudov himself was the one who was doing any of this stuff.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.120
As the final author on the paper and as a scientist of his caliber,

09:13.120 --> 09:17.600
he's likely just there at an advisory role meeting with the students and postdocs who are

09:17.600 --> 09:21.600
working with him who actually do all the legwork for each of these papers. But nevertheless,

09:21.600 --> 09:25.360
it still doesn't look good to have so many papers with your name on it that have these

09:25.360 --> 09:29.280
kind of anomalies coming up. So let me know what you think of this Sudov situation in the

09:29.280 --> 09:40.560
comments below. Thank you guys so much for watching and I will see you in the next one. Bye bye.
