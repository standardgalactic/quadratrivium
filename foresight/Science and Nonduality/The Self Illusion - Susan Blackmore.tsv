0	3660	Dwi'n gwybod i'r ysgol, ond that's what I'm supposed to be talking about.
3660	6160	I would say the self is an illusion.
6160	8660	What do I mean by illusion?
8660	15920	I don't mean, and like Dan Dennis and other people who are interested in illusions,
15920	19620	you get accused of saying it doesn't exist.
19620	21620	The Buddha had this trouble, didn't he?
21620	23700	To some people, he would say, of course the self exists,
23700	26200	and to other people he'd say, no, there's no self.
26200	28000	I think the point about this is,
28000	31720	it's not that there isn't a self, it's that the self is not what we think.
31720	33720	So look it up in the dictionary,
33720	36720	which is what I did when I started to get into trouble with this concept.
36720	40080	Illusion in the dictionary is usually defined as something like,
40080	42320	something that is not what it seems to be,
42320	45120	something that we're deluded about its nature.
45120	49920	So I would like to ask you now, just for a moment, to be conscious
49920	52920	and see what is it like to be me now?
59000	61000	Right.
61000	64000	Does it seem a bit like this?
67000	70000	Well, I know that you know that there isn't an armchair in your head
70000	72000	that you're sitting in,
72000	76000	but I suggest many of you will have dropped out of this feeling,
76000	78000	but you can probably drop back into it.
78000	81000	Most people in the world, I think, do feel something like this.
81000	83000	It's very natural.
83000	85000	It seems to be the way that we're built.
86000	88000	That we feel as, oh, there's my foot.
88000	91000	That's my foot, that's my knee, that's my tummy,
91000	94000	and I'm in here looking at them when I look this end.
94000	96000	I'm up here and I'm looking at my foot,
96000	98000	and I'm over here and you're out there.
98000	100000	That's a kind of natural way that we feel about ourselves.
100000	102000	But of course it's rubbish.
102000	106000	There's not only no armchair, but there isn't any place in the brain.
106000	108000	This is what Dan Denic calls the Cartesian Theatre.
108000	111000	It's this alluring place that we kind of invent.
111000	113000	We may give up Cartesian dualism,
113000	116000	but we may be absolutely sure that there isn't mind stuff and physical stuff
116000	118000	or matter and consciousness.
118000	120000	We know, we say we're modest,
120000	125000	but actually we still believe in a kind of experiencing self,
125000	128000	the experiencer and the experience,
128000	131000	and according to him, and I would agree,
131000	135000	this just doesn't fit with what we know about how the brain works at all.
135000	138000	So that's why he says that when you discard Cartesian dualism,
138000	140000	as almost everybody does,
140000	143000	you can really discard the show that would have gone on in the Cartesian Theatre
143000	145000	and the audience as well.
145000	148000	Now, people often throw out the audience or they think they do,
148000	150000	but it kind of creeps back.
150000	152000	It's even harder to throw out the show.
152000	155000	The feeling that I am having a stream of experiences
155000	159000	is so compelling that we keep getting back into it,
159000	163000	but it makes no sense at all in terms of what's going on in the brain.
163000	166000	When you look at the visual cortex here at the back of your brain,
166000	168000	which is a good proportion of your brain,
168000	170000	the vision is very important in humans.
170000	173000	You find there's something like 40 parallel pathways going on there,
173000	176000	some meet up again and separate out, others don't.
176000	179000	Different information going through the ventral stream and the dorsal stream
179000	181000	and doing different jobs,
181000	183000	and they never come together into some kind of place
183000	186000	where the picture is that you see in the world,
186000	189000	because you don't actually see a picture in the world.
189000	192000	We're kind of compelling this feeling that,
192000	194000	oh, I can see the whole room when you actually,
194000	197000	that's another whole story, which I often talk about and written about,
197000	199000	but to do with change blindness,
199000	201000	inattentional blindness and so on.
201000	205000	We can show that there isn't that kind of representation.
205000	208000	There isn't anywhere in the brain where the show happens.
208000	210000	There's just shows going on all over the place,
210000	213000	lots and lots and lots of parallel shows.
213000	215000	What about the self who might be experiencing them?
215000	217000	Well, there's no middle.
217000	220000	The brain is not organised in such a way that stuff comes in
220000	223000	and ends up somewhere and then orders go out.
223000	225000	Not at all.
225000	227000	There's stuff going through here.
227000	229000	I mean, the fact that I'm not going to crash into this
229000	233000	is all happening very, very far through the dorsal stream,
233000	235000	straight to motor cortex from eyes,
235000	238000	without going through the other part in the ventral stream,
238000	241000	which does all the perception and decides, oh, it's flowers.
241000	243000	That happens more slowly.
243000	245000	They don't come together these things.
245000	246000	They're separate.
246000	249000	I know that's kind of weird, but it's important to know that
249000	254000	because it helps to kind of throw apart intellectually,
254000	256000	intellectually throw apart the idea
256000	259000	that there's me inside here doing it,
259000	263000	and give rise, therefore, to understanding a little bit
263000	266000	about what it might mean to say that I am an illusion
266000	268000	or the self as an illusion.
268000	271000	It feels this way, but it really isn't.
271000	275000	It feels, I submit, but I'm pleased to argue for many of you,
275000	278000	it may not feel this way with an audience like this
278000	282000	of people who've generally done a lot of meditation,
282000	286000	mindfulness in exploration.
286000	288000	Oh, here I am.
288000	289000	It seems to be me.
289000	293000	It seems to be one me, one me in charge of this body,
293000	295000	unified, continuous.
295000	297000	It seems to be, well, it doesn't any more, actually,
297000	300000	but it used to seem to be that it was me a few minutes ago,
300000	302000	and before that it was me and the little girl and so on,
302000	305000	that there was something continuous about the me's generated
305000	308000	by this brain and this body.
308000	312000	It seems to be that there's a me having a stream of experiences,
312000	317000	and it seems to be that I have some effect on my body.
317000	319000	I can say.
319000	322000	I can raise my hand, and I did it.
322000	327000	Now, there's plenty of psychological evidence, fascinating stuff.
327000	330000	That's just an illusion.
330000	332000	We have thoughts.
332000	333000	No, really, really.
333000	335000	I mean, Libet's work is just the start.
335000	339000	We have thoughts about an action, say, the action happens.
339000	340000	There's a correlation.
340000	341000	They're in that order.
341000	343000	We jump to the conclusion that one caused the other,
343000	345000	but we can tell from what's going on in the brain
345000	348000	that it isn't like that at all.
348000	354000	Indeed, we know so much now about the mechanisms of self-control,
354000	358000	of decision-making, of choices, and so on,
358000	360000	and where they're happening in frontal cortex, prefrontal cortex,
360000	363000	and so on, again distributed and so on,
363000	367000	and the idea of there being a me who initiates actions is just bonkers,
367000	370000	but it still feels that way.
370000	372000	The science, I think, is therefore very helpful,
372000	374000	because it goes on banging here.
374000	375000	You're not in there.
375000	378000	There's just this stuff doing something, whatever it is,
378000	381000	and we don't even know fundamentally what it is.
381000	382000	I've said that already.
382000	385000	There's nowhere in there where it all comes together.
385000	388000	There's just all this massive parallel processing going on,
388000	391000	causing this body to these words to come out,
391000	395000	and this body not to crash into the pretty flowers.
399000	403000	So, let's take a different tack.
403000	405000	Let's say...
405000	408000	Are you going to come and do something to me again?
412000	414000	Later.
417000	420000	Let's say I sit in meditation
420000	422000	and look for myself.
422000	425000	Or I could do Douglas Harding kind of thing, couldn't I?
429000	432000	I look for the person who's looking, and what do I find?
432000	434000	I find the world.
434000	436000	I can go round and round.
443000	447000	I don't find myself as I thought it was.
447000	452000	I don't find a consistent experiencer of the experiences.
452000	456000	I find help! I don't know!
456000	458000	Instead.
459000	464000	I want to tell you a little bit about some simple explorations.
464000	466000	I want one particular exploration, actually,
466000	471000	and then I'll kind of wind up with explaining
471000	474000	what I called the talk, what I did call it.
474000	477000	Years ago, I used to teach a consciousness course in Bristol.
477000	479000	I did it for about ten years,
479000	482000	and it resulted in the textbook that I wrote about consciousness.
482000	484000	I don't know how I got into it,
484000	486000	but it happened very early on, probably in the first year,
486000	489000	that I started to get the students to ask a question.
489000	491000	Every week, they had to ask it hundreds of times,
491000	493000	as many times as they could every day.
493000	495000	It's amazingly difficult to get them to do it,
495000	497000	and they'd all come, oh, I forgot!
497000	500000	And then they'd put stickers on the kettle and stickers on the door,
500000	502000	and prod each other in pairs to make them remember,
502000	504000	and all kinds of tricks, still hard.
504000	506000	I don't know why it's so hard, it is.
506000	508000	By the way, are you conscious now?
510000	512000	Well...
513000	515000	Of course, I love the ones who say, of course,
515000	517000	that's confidence.
518000	520000	I also like the ones shaking their heads.
520000	522000	I don't like the people who don't say anything.
522000	524000	Are you conscious now?
524000	527000	Great, we love a lovely mixture of yes and no.
528000	531000	Now, there's a very, very interesting thing about this question.
531000	534000	This is question number one in week number one of this 20-week course.
535000	537000	Are you conscious now? You've just walked in?
539000	541000	Are you conscious now?
542000	544000	Doesn't know.
546000	548000	The odd thing about this question is,
548000	550000	I know there were some of you saying no,
550000	553000	and there are various interesting reasons why you might be saying no.
553000	555000	But normally, basically, if you ask,
555000	557000	am I conscious now, the answer is always yes.
559000	562000	Did any of you get the odd sensation
562000	565000	when I asked you, are you conscious now,
565000	568000	of sort of, oop, kind of becoming, yeah?
568000	571000	It's like, oh, you're becoming conscious because I've asked you.
571000	573000	Yeah? Something like that.
573000	575000	Now, this can be very puzzling,
575000	577000	because you think to yourself,
577000	579000	well, of course I was conscious before,
579000	582000	but then something happened that was different.
582000	584000	What changed?
584000	587000	It felt like I was becoming conscious,
587000	590000	but does that mean I wasn't conscious before?
590000	592000	It's a very odd thing.
592000	594000	Not all of you will have had it,
594000	596000	but perhaps if I tap you on the back later on,
596000	598000	and you're not being very mindful,
598000	600000	what was I conscious before?
600000	602000	So this took me to my next question.
602000	605000	This, by the way, I wrote a book about this,
605000	608000	which was originally called Ten's End Questions,
608000	612000	and then they decided to bring the paper back out
612000	614000	and change the title, which is really irritating.
614000	617000	So don't go on by both books because they're the same,
617000	619000	and it really annoys me,
619000	621000	but it's a much more trendy title, isn't it,
621000	623000	Zen and the Art of Consciousness?
623000	627000	Anyway, that peculiar thing that you experienced
627000	630000	than a few other people did led me to the second question.
630000	633000	What was I conscious of a moment ago?
633000	637000	I would like you all to ask yourself that question now.
637000	640000	What was I conscious of a moment ago?
642000	647000	Now, I don't know if this works for any of you.
647000	650000	It took me a long time for this to stabilise,
650000	651000	and I mean a long time.
651000	652000	When I was writing this book,
652000	655000	some of the chapters are based on co-un retreats
655000	658000	with other people, organised co-un retreats.
658000	661000	Most of them are based on the solitary retreats,
661000	662000	which I did on my own,
662000	664000	either up in the Welsh mountains or at home.
664000	667000	I would ask the same question hour after hour,
667000	672000	day after day, based on simple Zen meditation,
672000	674000	as I was in.
674000	677000	Calm the mind for quite a while,
677000	680000	and just let the question calm when it comes.
680000	683000	What was I conscious of a moment ago?
683000	685000	Okay, I've just done it now.
685000	686000	Now, the obvious thought would be,
686000	689000	I was conscious of the words coming out of my mouth,
689000	691000	because surely I must have been thinking about them,
691000	693000	because giving a lecture is quite,
693000	695000	you need a bit of attention.
695000	697000	But I can hear that humming noise over there
697000	700000	as though somebody's been listening.
700000	702000	Hang on, I was sort of faintly aware
702000	705000	of a man nodding over there.
705000	706000	I'd forgotten.
706000	707000	If I hadn't asked myself the question,
707000	709000	that would have gone.
709000	712000	But it sort of feels as though,
712000	715000	well, there was somebody listening to that noise over there,
715000	716000	but it wasn't me,
716000	720000	because I was concentrating on what I was saying.
720000	723000	When I was doing this out in the wilds of the mountains,
723000	724000	I would get this sense,
724000	726000	or it was more interesting when I was doing it at home,
726000	730000	have a meditation hut in the garden.
730000	734000	Because I was, what was I conscious of a moment ago,
734000	738000	and multiple parallel threads would be obvious.
738000	741000	I hadn't even noticed, because I'm just sitting,
741000	744000	there's a great drilling going on in the road.
744000	746000	But when I asked that question,
746000	749000	it's as though somebody was listening to the drilling.
749000	752000	Who was it?
752000	756000	Somebody was aware of my bottom sitting on the cushion,
756000	758000	and the cat's been purring for ages.
758000	760000	In fact, I kind of remember the cat
760000	762000	turning up and curling up next to me.
762000	764000	All of these things, when I look backwards,
764000	766000	so what's going on?
766000	768000	Now, that's the experience, okay?
768000	771000	But I'm now jumping to an intellectual interpretation
771000	773000	of the experience that might be wrong.
773000	775000	It's always dangerous to do that.
775000	776000	But my interpretation,
776000	779000	I tried inventing this little graphic this morning,
779000	781000	which doesn't quite do it justice,
781000	783000	but what I'm thinking is something like this.
783000	786000	Most of the time,
786000	789000	most of our lives, most of the time,
789000	791000	what's happening is what you'd expect
791000	794000	in a complex brain, in a complex body, in a complex world.
794000	797000	There's multiple parallel streams going along,
797000	799000	and none of them is in consciousness
799000	801000	or out of consciousness.
801000	803000	None of them is what I am experiencing
803000	806000	or I'm not experiencing.
806000	808000	They're all just going along, some bigger than others,
808000	810000	and that's what these lines are.
810000	812000	Some are ephemeral, very short-lived,
812000	814000	some are rather longer, some maybe they're ourselves.
814000	817000	Maybe this one, there's a bit of a self-construct going along,
817000	819000	and we know where these self-constructs are made
819000	822000	in the temporal parietal junction,
822000	824000	is the body image made, and so on.
824000	827000	So we can track those things if we wanted to.
827000	830000	But what I'm suggesting is there might even be two in parallel.
830000	832000	There might be several in parallel,
832000	834000	the coming and going, shifting,
834000	837000	but then, you ask the question, am I conscious now?
837000	841000	Or any question you like that propels you into mindfulness?
841000	844000	And then what happens?
844000	846000	All the rest kind of...
846000	848000	and they're all brought together,
848000	850000	and you go, oh, here I am,
850000	852000	and that's fine.
852000	854000	But you make the mistake.
854000	856000	This is where the delusion comes about of going,
856000	859000	and I was conscious before, and I've been conscious all day.
859000	861000	Somebody mentioned that in a lecture this morning,
861000	864000	just with utter confidence, oh, I've been conscious all the time.
864000	866000	I submit that you haven't.
866000	868000	And every time this happens,
868000	870000	which will be many, many times a day
870000	872000	if you're practising something like mindfulness
872000	874000	and falling out of mindfulness,
874000	877000	then, if you're mindful all the time,
877000	879000	then you're staying like this,
879000	885000	then if you keep popping back into it,
885000	887000	you think it's the same self,
887000	890000	or at least that's the delusionary way of thinking about it.
890000	892000	Mindfulness is very interesting
892000	894000	because I suspect that in the beginning
894000	896000	in mindfulness is that you bring up this self,
896000	898000	I am being mindful,
898000	901000	and that's that transition there.
901000	904000	And you can keep the self for a long time
904000	906000	with practice of mindfulness.
906000	908000	But I think what happens later on in mindfulness practice
908000	910000	is that the self drops out,
910000	914000	and possibly awareness can remain
914000	917000	of this parallel state in which there isn't a self,
917000	920000	and then one is seeing clearly only there isn't a self
920000	923000	to see clearly, rather there is just experiences
923000	925000	without an experiencer.
925000	928000	But that's really another issue.
928000	932000	So, what happened in the last half an hour or so?
932000	934000	There was a me, because I got quite nervous
934000	936000	because there was a problem with the wires.
936000	940000	I'm thinking, there's a man, full away.
940000	942000	And there's another one.
942000	944000	And then there's another one.
944000	946000	And then there's a whole distracted gap
946000	949000	with a whole lot of things going, oh, and here I am again.
949000	952000	But I'm not, this thing here is not conned
952000	955000	into thinking it's the same me.
955000	958000	Partly because of the science,
958000	961000	and partly because of the personal enquiry,
961000	965000	I say that wasn't the same me.
965000	968000	And looking forward into the future,
968000	971000	it won't be the same me either.
971000	973000	In a few minutes I'll be, oh, no,
973000	976000	in a few minutes I'll be answering your questions, I hope.
976000	978000	And should a me pop up and a sensation of I'm over here
978000	980000	and you're over there and I'm going to answer the questions,
980000	982000	that will be a new me.
982000	987000	She won't be me, this one.
987000	989000	How do we live with this?
989000	991000	If it's true, it may not be.
991000	995000	I really like, this is my kind of scientist nature coming out.
995000	998000	Have an idea, have a hypothesis, we'll go and test it.
998000	1001000	Right, okay, I'll go and live my life like this
1001000	1004000	and see how it works out and what happens.
1004000	1006000	And if I'm wrong, someone can prove me wrong
1006000	1009000	and I'll change your mind, do something else, equally daft maybe.
1009000	1011000	But how do we live with this?
1011000	1013000	One little trick I've discovered,
1013000	1015000	and I would love to hear from other people
1015000	1019000	if any of you have been doing anything similar, is this.
1019000	1024000	It is, I'm going to just discuss three things about it.
1024000	1028000	It's learning to let go of her.
1028000	1031000	This is very tricky,
1031000	1036000	because as long as I feel that this is me,
1036000	1038000	I want to carry on.
1038000	1040000	And there's another interesting intellectual question, why?
1040000	1042000	Why do cells want to carry on?
1042000	1044000	Why are they so greedy to exist?
1044000	1046000	I don't know where they are.
1046000	1051000	So a practice that I've been doing is whenever there's a feeling of,
1051000	1053000	here I am, am I conscious now?
1053000	1056000	Yes, here I am.
1056000	1060000	I think and willing to not be.
1060000	1063000	In any way, it's only like going to sleep at night, isn't it?
1063000	1065000	I mean, you lie down, you think,
1065000	1067000	I'm going to stop existing until the morning,
1067000	1070000	and you sort of, that's kind of why going to sleep is such a weird thing.
1070000	1073000	But it's sort of the same, going to sleep while awake,
1073000	1075000	or disappearing, dying if you like.
1075000	1078000	Just, ah, she's allowed to go.
1078000	1081000	Importantly, similar to in meditation,
1081000	1084000	the dealing with thoughts, it's not go away.
1084000	1086000	It's not, oh, here I am, go away.
1086000	1088000	No, no, oh, here I am, oh.
1088000	1090000	I'll go away at some point.
1090000	1092000	Letting her go away.
1092000	1095000	That's, I think, quite helpful.
1095000	1101000	It's also part of this kind of comparison between before and after the question.
1101000	1105000	The unified, mindful state of being me experiencing stuff,
1105000	1110000	and the kind of normal everyday parallel processing distracted state.
1110000	1112000	Looking back into that,
1112000	1115000	it reminds me of one of my favourite quotes from William Jaynes,
1115000	1117000	who is my great, great hero.
1117000	1120000	He tried a lot of introspection,
1120000	1125000	and he said introspection of this kind is like trying to turn up the gas quickly enough
1125000	1129000	to see how the darkness looks.
1129000	1131000	Of course, he'd have electricity now.
1131000	1134000	It would be much quicker, wouldn't it?
1134000	1139000	And you can't look into the darkness by shining the light.
1139000	1142000	Was that any time left or stop now?
1142000	1144000	Ah, brilliant, thank you.
1145000	1148000	So this is an attempt, if you like, to look into the darkness,
1148000	1150000	but I can't look into the darkness.
1150000	1153000	But by letting myself go, as it were, her,
1153000	1155000	whoever she is, this one who appears,
1155000	1158000	then maybe the darkness can become light.
1158000	1160000	So that's one little trick.
1160000	1162000	But one might reasonably have a question about,
1162000	1165000	I call it morality, but I'm not sure I couldn't think of a better word,
1165000	1169000	but if she won't be me, then why should I care?
1169000	1172000	I mean, if it's not going to be me in the future
1172000	1175000	who's going to suffer the pain or the joy or whatever it is,
1175000	1177000	then why should I care about what happens?
1177000	1180000	Why should I do anything? Why should I act?
1180000	1182000	Now, I think many of you would say,
1182000	1185000	well, you don't actually, and I agree, one doesn't.
1185000	1189000	It's not me who acts, neither scientifically nor experientially.
1189000	1191000	Actions happen.
1191000	1195000	Or to quote another Buddhist thing,
1195000	1198000	actions exist and also their consequences,
1198000	1201000	but the person that acts does not.
1201000	1203000	But then why should I care?
1203000	1207000	Well, I think the reason, I'm concerned about this really,
1207000	1212000	because why do I care about her this afternoon if she's not me?
1212000	1214000	Well, she's kind of similar to me,
1214000	1216000	and will have similar memories
1216000	1218000	and similar tendencies to behave,
1218000	1220000	because after all, she's going to be constructed,
1220000	1222000	an illusion constructed by this body.
1222000	1224000	Maybe that's the reason.
1224000	1226000	But I think actually more generally,
1226000	1229000	it's only the same as, you know, in general,
1229000	1231000	I see suffering all around in the world,
1231000	1234000	and kind of I'd rather people didn't suffer.
1234000	1239000	And the same for these selves in the future.
1239000	1241000	And this thing here has some capacity to determine,
1241000	1246000	at least the pleasures and sufferings of the similar selves
1246000	1248000	that will come in the future,
1248000	1251000	more than I can do anything for the rest of you.
1251000	1253000	So maybe that's enough.
1253000	1257000	But also I feel a kind of gratitude towards previous selves
1257000	1259000	that put me here.
1259000	1261000	I had a lovely time last night.
1261000	1263000	I went out after dinner in the woods and it was nearly dark.
1263000	1264000	It was a bit silly of me,
1264000	1266000	because coming back through the woods in the nearly dark
1266000	1269000	was poking my eyes with stick, you know, trees and what have you.
1269000	1270000	But it was wonderful out there.
1270000	1272000	I was marching round and round the trees,
1272000	1274000	thinking what I'm going to say today.
1274000	1276000	And I think a sort of mutual gratitude between the prior,
1276000	1278000	the previous and the future selves
1278000	1283000	is also kind of encouraging to nice behaviour
1283000	1286000	rather than nasty behaviour.
1286000	1288000	And what about death?
1288000	1291000	Well, all I've been describing is allowing oneself to die again
1291000	1293000	and again all the time.
1293000	1296000	So in that sense, it's only the same, isn't it?
1296000	1297000	When the body finally goes,
1297000	1299000	well, all of these rather similar selves will stop,
1299000	1301000	but hey, they were all stopping anyway.
1301000	1303000	They were all being let go.
1304000	1309000	And this bugbear about reincarnation.
1309000	1313000	Like so many western scientists interested in Buddhism
1313000	1319000	and related ideas, reincarnation does seem stupid.
1319000	1321000	What on earth is going to be reincarnated?
1321000	1323000	What's it all about?
1323000	1324000	I get in trouble.
1324000	1327000	I've had an email thing on one of my blogs
1327000	1330000	with a Buddhist teacher getting really angry with me.
1330000	1331000	And I say, I'm not a Buddhist
1331000	1333000	and I can say what I like, actually.
1333000	1335000	And so can you.
1335000	1337000	And that's fine.
1337000	1340000	But why I think it's daft is because
1340000	1343000	what I've described as selves can't be reincarnated
1343000	1344000	is nothing personal.
1344000	1347000	So what is all this stuff about the cycle of birth and death
1347000	1348000	or rebirth?
1348000	1349000	What's that about then?
1349000	1350000	Is it about anything?
1350000	1353000	Well, here's a very different interpretation.
1353000	1354000	Yes, it is.
1354000	1356000	It's actually a very straightforward insight
1356000	1357000	into what it is to be alive.
1357000	1361000	It's constantly dying and being born again.
1361000	1363000	Selves are rising and falling away.
1363000	1366000	And so long as you believe that it's the same self
1366000	1368000	and it's continuous and unitary and has powers
1368000	1370000	and does things and is in charge of its body
1370000	1374000	and all of that, you're still stuck in all of that delusion.
1374000	1378000	But if you just go, oh, here it comes, here it goes, you're not.
1378000	1384000	Could that be something about what getting off the rebirth thing is about?
1384000	1385000	I don't know.
1385000	1387000	I throw that in as a pure speculation.
1387000	1390000	But let me go back to where I was.
1390000	1392000	These selves just pop up.
1392000	1394000	Oh, here's another one.
1394000	1397000	And she'll be about to say goodbye.
1397000	1401000	And I hope that makes sense of why I called it She Won't Be Me.
