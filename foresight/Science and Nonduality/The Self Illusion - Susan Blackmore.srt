1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
Dwi'n gwybod i'r ysgol, ond that's what I'm supposed to be talking about.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,160
I would say the self is an illusion.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,660
What do I mean by illusion?

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:15,920
I don't mean, and like Dan Dennis and other people who are interested in illusions,

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,620
you get accused of saying it doesn't exist.

6
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,620
The Buddha had this trouble, didn't he?

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,700
To some people, he would say, of course the self exists,

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,200
and to other people he'd say, no, there's no self.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,000
I think the point about this is,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,720
it's not that there isn't a self, it's that the self is not what we think.

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,720
So look it up in the dictionary,

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,720
which is what I did when I started to get into trouble with this concept.

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,080
Illusion in the dictionary is usually defined as something like,

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,320
something that is not what it seems to be,

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,120
something that we're deluded about its nature.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,920
So I would like to ask you now, just for a moment, to be conscious

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,920
and see what is it like to be me now?

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Right.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Does it seem a bit like this?

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, I know that you know that there isn't an armchair in your head

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
that you're sitting in,

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but I suggest many of you will have dropped out of this feeling,

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
but you can probably drop back into it.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Most people in the world, I think, do feel something like this.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's very natural.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It seems to be the way that we're built.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That we feel as, oh, there's my foot.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's my foot, that's my knee, that's my tummy,

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and I'm in here looking at them when I look this end.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm up here and I'm looking at my foot,

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and I'm over here and you're out there.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's a kind of natural way that we feel about ourselves.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But of course it's rubbish.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There's not only no armchair, but there isn't any place in the brain.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is what Dan Denic calls the Cartesian Theatre.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's this alluring place that we kind of invent.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We may give up Cartesian dualism,

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
but we may be absolutely sure that there isn't mind stuff and physical stuff

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
or matter and consciousness.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We know, we say we're modest,

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
but actually we still believe in a kind of experiencing self,

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the experiencer and the experience,

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and according to him, and I would agree,

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
this just doesn't fit with what we know about how the brain works at all.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So that's why he says that when you discard Cartesian dualism,

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
as almost everybody does,

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
you can really discard the show that would have gone on in the Cartesian Theatre

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and the audience as well.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Now, people often throw out the audience or they think they do,

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
but it kind of creeps back.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's even harder to throw out the show.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The feeling that I am having a stream of experiences

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
is so compelling that we keep getting back into it,

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
but it makes no sense at all in terms of what's going on in the brain.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
When you look at the visual cortex here at the back of your brain,

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
which is a good proportion of your brain,

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
the vision is very important in humans.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You find there's something like 40 parallel pathways going on there,

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
some meet up again and separate out, others don't.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Different information going through the ventral stream and the dorsal stream

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
and doing different jobs,

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and they never come together into some kind of place

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
where the picture is that you see in the world,

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
because you don't actually see a picture in the world.

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We're kind of compelling this feeling that,

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
oh, I can see the whole room when you actually,

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
that's another whole story, which I often talk about and written about,

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
but to do with change blindness,

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
inattentional blindness and so on.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We can show that there isn't that kind of representation.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There isn't anywhere in the brain where the show happens.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There's just shows going on all over the place,

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
lots and lots and lots of parallel shows.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What about the self who might be experiencing them?

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Well, there's no middle.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The brain is not organised in such a way that stuff comes in

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and ends up somewhere and then orders go out.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Not at all.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
There's stuff going through here.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I mean, the fact that I'm not going to crash into this

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
is all happening very, very far through the dorsal stream,

82
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
straight to motor cortex from eyes,

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
without going through the other part in the ventral stream,

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
which does all the perception and decides, oh, it's flowers.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That happens more slowly.

86
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
They don't come together these things.

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They're separate.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I know that's kind of weird, but it's important to know that

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
because it helps to kind of throw apart intellectually,

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
intellectually throw apart the idea

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
that there's me inside here doing it,

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and give rise, therefore, to understanding a little bit

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
about what it might mean to say that I am an illusion

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
or the self as an illusion.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It feels this way, but it really isn't.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It feels, I submit, but I'm pleased to argue for many of you,

97
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
it may not feel this way with an audience like this

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
of people who've generally done a lot of meditation,

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
mindfulness in exploration.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, here I am.

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It seems to be me.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It seems to be one me, one me in charge of this body,

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
unified, continuous.

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It seems to be, well, it doesn't any more, actually,

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
but it used to seem to be that it was me a few minutes ago,

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and before that it was me and the little girl and so on,

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
that there was something continuous about the me's generated

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
by this brain and this body.

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It seems to be that there's a me having a stream of experiences,

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and it seems to be that I have some effect on my body.

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I can say.

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I can raise my hand, and I did it.

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Now, there's plenty of psychological evidence, fascinating stuff.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's just an illusion.

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We have thoughts.

116
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No, really, really.

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I mean, Libet's work is just the start.

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
We have thoughts about an action, say, the action happens.

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
There's a correlation.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They're in that order.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We jump to the conclusion that one caused the other,

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
but we can tell from what's going on in the brain

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
that it isn't like that at all.

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Indeed, we know so much now about the mechanisms of self-control,

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
of decision-making, of choices, and so on,

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and where they're happening in frontal cortex, prefrontal cortex,

127
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and so on, again distributed and so on,

128
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and the idea of there being a me who initiates actions is just bonkers,

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
but it still feels that way.

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The science, I think, is therefore very helpful,

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
because it goes on banging here.

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're not in there.

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There's just this stuff doing something, whatever it is,

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
and we don't even know fundamentally what it is.

135
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I've said that already.

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There's nowhere in there where it all comes together.

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
There's just all this massive parallel processing going on,

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
causing this body to these words to come out,

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and this body not to crash into the pretty flowers.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So, let's take a different tack.

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let's say...

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Are you going to come and do something to me again?

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Later.

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Let's say I sit in meditation

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and look for myself.

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Or I could do Douglas Harding kind of thing, couldn't I?

147
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I look for the person who's looking, and what do I find?

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I find the world.

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I can go round and round.

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't find myself as I thought it was.

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't find a consistent experiencer of the experiences.

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I find help! I don't know!

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Instead.

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I want to tell you a little bit about some simple explorations.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I want one particular exploration, actually,

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and then I'll kind of wind up with explaining

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
what I called the talk, what I did call it.

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Years ago, I used to teach a consciousness course in Bristol.

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I did it for about ten years,

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and it resulted in the textbook that I wrote about consciousness.

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't know how I got into it,

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
but it happened very early on, probably in the first year,

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
that I started to get the students to ask a question.

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Every week, they had to ask it hundreds of times,

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
as many times as they could every day.

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's amazingly difficult to get them to do it,

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
and they'd all come, oh, I forgot!

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And then they'd put stickers on the kettle and stickers on the door,

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and prod each other in pairs to make them remember,

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and all kinds of tricks, still hard.

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't know why it's so hard, it is.

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
By the way, are you conscious now?

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Well...

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Of course, I love the ones who say, of course,

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
that's confidence.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I also like the ones shaking their heads.

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't like the people who don't say anything.

178
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Are you conscious now?

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Great, we love a lovely mixture of yes and no.

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now, there's a very, very interesting thing about this question.

181
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is question number one in week number one of this 20-week course.

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Are you conscious now? You've just walked in?

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Are you conscious now?

184
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Doesn't know.

185
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The odd thing about this question is,

186
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I know there were some of you saying no,

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and there are various interesting reasons why you might be saying no.

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But normally, basically, if you ask,

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
am I conscious now, the answer is always yes.

190
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Did any of you get the odd sensation

191
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
when I asked you, are you conscious now,

192
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
of sort of, oop, kind of becoming, yeah?

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's like, oh, you're becoming conscious because I've asked you.

194
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yeah? Something like that.

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Now, this can be very puzzling,

196
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
because you think to yourself,

197
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
well, of course I was conscious before,

198
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
but then something happened that was different.

199
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What changed?

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It felt like I was becoming conscious,

201
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
but does that mean I wasn't conscious before?

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's a very odd thing.

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Not all of you will have had it,

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
but perhaps if I tap you on the back later on,

205
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and you're not being very mindful,

206
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
what was I conscious before?

207
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So this took me to my next question.

208
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This, by the way, I wrote a book about this,

209
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
which was originally called Ten's End Questions,

210
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
and then they decided to bring the paper back out

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and change the title, which is really irritating.

212
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So don't go on by both books because they're the same,

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
and it really annoys me,

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
but it's a much more trendy title, isn't it,

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Zen and the Art of Consciousness?

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Anyway, that peculiar thing that you experienced

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
than a few other people did led me to the second question.

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What was I conscious of a moment ago?

219
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I would like you all to ask yourself that question now.

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What was I conscious of a moment ago?

221
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Now, I don't know if this works for any of you.

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It took me a long time for this to stabilise,

223
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
and I mean a long time.

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
When I was writing this book,

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
some of the chapters are based on co-un retreats

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
with other people, organised co-un retreats.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Most of them are based on the solitary retreats,

228
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
which I did on my own,

229
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
either up in the Welsh mountains or at home.

230
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I would ask the same question hour after hour,

231
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
day after day, based on simple Zen meditation,

232
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
as I was in.

233
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Calm the mind for quite a while,

234
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and just let the question calm when it comes.

235
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What was I conscious of a moment ago?

236
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Okay, I've just done it now.

237
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Now, the obvious thought would be,

238
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I was conscious of the words coming out of my mouth,

239
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
because surely I must have been thinking about them,

240
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
because giving a lecture is quite,

241
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
you need a bit of attention.

242
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But I can hear that humming noise over there

243
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
as though somebody's been listening.

244
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Hang on, I was sort of faintly aware

245
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
of a man nodding over there.

246
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'd forgotten.

247
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If I hadn't asked myself the question,

248
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
that would have gone.

249
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But it sort of feels as though,

250
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
well, there was somebody listening to that noise over there,

251
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
but it wasn't me,

252
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
because I was concentrating on what I was saying.

253
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
When I was doing this out in the wilds of the mountains,

254
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I would get this sense,

255
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
or it was more interesting when I was doing it at home,

256
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
have a meditation hut in the garden.

257
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Because I was, what was I conscious of a moment ago,

258
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and multiple parallel threads would be obvious.

259
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I hadn't even noticed, because I'm just sitting,

260
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
there's a great drilling going on in the road.

261
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But when I asked that question,

262
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
it's as though somebody was listening to the drilling.

263
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Who was it?

264
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Somebody was aware of my bottom sitting on the cushion,

265
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and the cat's been purring for ages.

266
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
In fact, I kind of remember the cat

267
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
turning up and curling up next to me.

268
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
All of these things, when I look backwards,

269
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
so what's going on?

270
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Now, that's the experience, okay?

271
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But I'm now jumping to an intellectual interpretation

272
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
of the experience that might be wrong.

273
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's always dangerous to do that.

274
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But my interpretation,

275
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I tried inventing this little graphic this morning,

276
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
which doesn't quite do it justice,

277
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
but what I'm thinking is something like this.

278
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Most of the time,

279
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
most of our lives, most of the time,

280
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
what's happening is what you'd expect

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
in a complex brain, in a complex body, in a complex world.

282
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
There's multiple parallel streams going along,

283
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and none of them is in consciousness

284
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
or out of consciousness.

285
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
None of them is what I am experiencing

286
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
or I'm not experiencing.

287
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
They're all just going along, some bigger than others,

288
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
and that's what these lines are.

289
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Some are ephemeral, very short-lived,

290
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
some are rather longer, some maybe they're ourselves.

291
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Maybe this one, there's a bit of a self-construct going along,

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and we know where these self-constructs are made

293
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
in the temporal parietal junction,

294
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
is the body image made, and so on.

295
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So we can track those things if we wanted to.

296
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But what I'm suggesting is there might even be two in parallel.

297
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
There might be several in parallel,

298
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
the coming and going, shifting,

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
but then, you ask the question, am I conscious now?

300
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Or any question you like that propels you into mindfulness?

301
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And then what happens?

302
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
All the rest kind of...

303
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and they're all brought together,

304
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and you go, oh, here I am,

305
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and that's fine.

306
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But you make the mistake.

307
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is where the delusion comes about of going,

308
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
and I was conscious before, and I've been conscious all day.

309
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Somebody mentioned that in a lecture this morning,

310
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
just with utter confidence, oh, I've been conscious all the time.

311
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I submit that you haven't.

312
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And every time this happens,

313
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
which will be many, many times a day

314
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
if you're practising something like mindfulness

315
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
and falling out of mindfulness,

316
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
then, if you're mindful all the time,

317
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
then you're staying like this,

318
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
then if you keep popping back into it,

319
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
you think it's the same self,

320
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
or at least that's the delusionary way of thinking about it.

321
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Mindfulness is very interesting

322
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
because I suspect that in the beginning

323
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
in mindfulness is that you bring up this self,

324
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I am being mindful,

325
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and that's that transition there.

326
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And you can keep the self for a long time

327
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
with practice of mindfulness.

328
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But I think what happens later on in mindfulness practice

329
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
is that the self drops out,

330
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
and possibly awareness can remain

331
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
of this parallel state in which there isn't a self,

332
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and then one is seeing clearly only there isn't a self

333
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
to see clearly, rather there is just experiences

334
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
without an experiencer.

335
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But that's really another issue.

336
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So, what happened in the last half an hour or so?

337
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
There was a me, because I got quite nervous

338
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
because there was a problem with the wires.

339
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm thinking, there's a man, full away.

340
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And there's another one.

341
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And then there's another one.

342
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And then there's a whole distracted gap

343
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
with a whole lot of things going, oh, and here I am again.

344
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But I'm not, this thing here is not conned

345
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
into thinking it's the same me.

346
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Partly because of the science,

347
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and partly because of the personal enquiry,

348
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I say that wasn't the same me.

349
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And looking forward into the future,

350
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
it won't be the same me either.

351
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
In a few minutes I'll be, oh, no,

352
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
in a few minutes I'll be answering your questions, I hope.

353
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And should a me pop up and a sensation of I'm over here

354
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
and you're over there and I'm going to answer the questions,

355
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
that will be a new me.

356
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
She won't be me, this one.

357
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
How do we live with this?

358
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
If it's true, it may not be.

359
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I really like, this is my kind of scientist nature coming out.

360
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Have an idea, have a hypothesis, we'll go and test it.

361
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Right, okay, I'll go and live my life like this

362
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
and see how it works out and what happens.

363
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
And if I'm wrong, someone can prove me wrong

364
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
and I'll change your mind, do something else, equally daft maybe.

365
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But how do we live with this?

366
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
One little trick I've discovered,

367
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
and I would love to hear from other people

368
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
if any of you have been doing anything similar, is this.

369
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It is, I'm going to just discuss three things about it.

370
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's learning to let go of her.

371
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This is very tricky,

372
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
because as long as I feel that this is me,

373
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I want to carry on.

374
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And there's another interesting intellectual question, why?

375
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Why do cells want to carry on?

376
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Why are they so greedy to exist?

377
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't know where they are.

378
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So a practice that I've been doing is whenever there's a feeling of,

379
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
here I am, am I conscious now?

380
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yes, here I am.

381
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I think and willing to not be.

382
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
In any way, it's only like going to sleep at night, isn't it?

383
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I mean, you lie down, you think,

384
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm going to stop existing until the morning,

385
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
and you sort of, that's kind of why going to sleep is such a weird thing.

386
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But it's sort of the same, going to sleep while awake,

387
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
or disappearing, dying if you like.

388
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Just, ah, she's allowed to go.

389
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Importantly, similar to in meditation,

390
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
the dealing with thoughts, it's not go away.

391
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's not, oh, here I am, go away.

392
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
No, no, oh, here I am, oh.

393
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'll go away at some point.

394
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Letting her go away.

395
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That's, I think, quite helpful.

396
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's also part of this kind of comparison between before and after the question.

397
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
The unified, mindful state of being me experiencing stuff,

398
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and the kind of normal everyday parallel processing distracted state.

399
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Looking back into that,

400
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
it reminds me of one of my favourite quotes from William Jaynes,

401
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
who is my great, great hero.

402
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
He tried a lot of introspection,

403
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and he said introspection of this kind is like trying to turn up the gas quickly enough

404
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
to see how the darkness looks.

405
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Of course, he'd have electricity now.

406
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It would be much quicker, wouldn't it?

407
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
And you can't look into the darkness by shining the light.

408
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Was that any time left or stop now?

409
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Ah, brilliant, thank you.

410
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So this is an attempt, if you like, to look into the darkness,

411
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
but I can't look into the darkness.

412
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
But by letting myself go, as it were, her,

413
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
whoever she is, this one who appears,

414
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
then maybe the darkness can become light.

415
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So that's one little trick.

416
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But one might reasonably have a question about,

417
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I call it morality, but I'm not sure I couldn't think of a better word,

418
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
but if she won't be me, then why should I care?

419
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I mean, if it's not going to be me in the future

420
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
who's going to suffer the pain or the joy or whatever it is,

421
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
then why should I care about what happens?

422
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Why should I do anything? Why should I act?

423
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Now, I think many of you would say,

424
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
well, you don't actually, and I agree, one doesn't.

425
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's not me who acts, neither scientifically nor experientially.

426
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Actions happen.

427
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Or to quote another Buddhist thing,

428
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
actions exist and also their consequences,

429
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
but the person that acts does not.

430
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
But then why should I care?

431
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Well, I think the reason, I'm concerned about this really,

432
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
because why do I care about her this afternoon if she's not me?

433
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Well, she's kind of similar to me,

434
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
and will have similar memories

435
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
and similar tendencies to behave,

436
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
because after all, she's going to be constructed,

437
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
an illusion constructed by this body.

438
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Maybe that's the reason.

439
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But I think actually more generally,

440
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
it's only the same as, you know, in general,

441
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I see suffering all around in the world,

442
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and kind of I'd rather people didn't suffer.

443
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And the same for these selves in the future.

444
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And this thing here has some capacity to determine,

445
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
at least the pleasures and sufferings of the similar selves

446
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
that will come in the future,

447
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
more than I can do anything for the rest of you.

448
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So maybe that's enough.

449
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
But also I feel a kind of gratitude towards previous selves

450
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
that put me here.

451
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I had a lovely time last night.

452
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I went out after dinner in the woods and it was nearly dark.

453
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It was a bit silly of me,

454
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
because coming back through the woods in the nearly dark

455
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
was poking my eyes with stick, you know, trees and what have you.

456
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But it was wonderful out there.

457
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I was marching round and round the trees,

458
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
thinking what I'm going to say today.

459
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And I think a sort of mutual gratitude between the prior,

460
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
the previous and the future selves

461
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
is also kind of encouraging to nice behaviour

462
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
rather than nasty behaviour.

463
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And what about death?

464
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Well, all I've been describing is allowing oneself to die again

465
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
and again all the time.

466
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So in that sense, it's only the same, isn't it?

467
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
When the body finally goes,

468
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
well, all of these rather similar selves will stop,

469
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
but hey, they were all stopping anyway.

470
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
They were all being let go.

471
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And this bugbear about reincarnation.

472
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Like so many western scientists interested in Buddhism

473
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
and related ideas, reincarnation does seem stupid.

474
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What on earth is going to be reincarnated?

475
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What's it all about?

476
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I get in trouble.

477
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I've had an email thing on one of my blogs

478
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
with a Buddhist teacher getting really angry with me.

479
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And I say, I'm not a Buddhist

480
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
and I can say what I like, actually.

481
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
And so can you.

482
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And that's fine.

483
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But why I think it's daft is because

484
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
what I've described as selves can't be reincarnated

485
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
is nothing personal.

486
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So what is all this stuff about the cycle of birth and death

487
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
or rebirth?

488
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What's that about then?

489
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Is it about anything?

490
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Well, here's a very different interpretation.

491
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Yes, it is.

492
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's actually a very straightforward insight

493
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
into what it is to be alive.

494
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's constantly dying and being born again.

495
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Selves are rising and falling away.

496
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And so long as you believe that it's the same self

497
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
and it's continuous and unitary and has powers

498
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
and does things and is in charge of its body

499
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
and all of that, you're still stuck in all of that delusion.

500
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But if you just go, oh, here it comes, here it goes, you're not.

501
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Could that be something about what getting off the rebirth thing is about?

502
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I don't know.

503
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I throw that in as a pure speculation.

504
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But let me go back to where I was.

505
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
These selves just pop up.

506
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Oh, here's another one.

507
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And she'll be about to say goodbye.

508
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And I hope that makes sense of why I called it She Won't Be Me.
