Checking Science and Nonduality/The Self Illusion - Susan Blackmore.txt
 The speaker discusses the concept of the self and its relationship with future selves and the idea of rebirth. They argue that our continuous sense of self is an illusion; each moment brings a new self, which is a series of mental and physical events happening in a body. These selves are not continuous entities but rather transient states that arise and pass away continuously.

The speaker suggests that the reason we might care about future selves or the well-being of others is due to a sense of similarity and shared experience, as well as a feeling of gratitude towards previous selves. They also address the common misconception about reincarnation in the Western scientific perspective, which seems absurd because it's unclear what would be reincarnated if the self is an ever-changing phenomenon.

The speaker offers an alternative interpretation of the Buddhist teachings on rebirth, proposing that it's not about the transfer of a permanent self from one body to another but rather an insight into the nature of being alive, which involves the constant process of dying and being reborn. This realization liberates us from the illusion of a fixed self and allows us to understand the impermanence of existence.

In essence, the speaker is emphasizing that our sense of self is an ever-changing process, and by recognizing this, we can find a deeper understanding of life's cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, which is central to many Eastern philosophies like Buddhism.
