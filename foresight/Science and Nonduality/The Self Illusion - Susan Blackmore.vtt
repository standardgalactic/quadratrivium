00:00.000 --> 00:03.660
Dwi'n gwybod i'r ysgol, ond that's what I'm supposed to be talking about.

00:03.660 --> 00:06.160
I would say the self is an illusion.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.660
What do I mean by illusion?

00:08.660 --> 00:15.920
I don't mean, and like Dan Dennis and other people who are interested in illusions,

00:15.920 --> 00:19.620
you get accused of saying it doesn't exist.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.620
The Buddha had this trouble, didn't he?

00:21.620 --> 00:23.700
To some people, he would say, of course the self exists,

00:23.700 --> 00:26.200
and to other people he'd say, no, there's no self.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.000
I think the point about this is,

00:28.000 --> 00:31.720
it's not that there isn't a self, it's that the self is not what we think.

00:31.720 --> 00:33.720
So look it up in the dictionary,

00:33.720 --> 00:36.720
which is what I did when I started to get into trouble with this concept.

00:36.720 --> 00:40.080
Illusion in the dictionary is usually defined as something like,

00:40.080 --> 00:42.320
something that is not what it seems to be,

00:42.320 --> 00:45.120
something that we're deluded about its nature.

00:45.120 --> 00:49.920
So I would like to ask you now, just for a moment, to be conscious

00:49.920 --> 00:52.920
and see what is it like to be me now?

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Right.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Does it seem a bit like this?

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Well, I know that you know that there isn't an armchair in your head

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
that you're sitting in,

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
but I suggest many of you will have dropped out of this feeling,

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
but you can probably drop back into it.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
Most people in the world, I think, do feel something like this.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
It's very natural.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
It seems to be the way that we're built.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
That we feel as, oh, there's my foot.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
That's my foot, that's my knee, that's my tummy,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
and I'm in here looking at them when I look this end.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
I'm up here and I'm looking at my foot,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
and I'm over here and you're out there.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
That's a kind of natural way that we feel about ourselves.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
But of course it's rubbish.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
There's not only no armchair, but there isn't any place in the brain.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
This is what Dan Denic calls the Cartesian Theatre.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
It's this alluring place that we kind of invent.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
We may give up Cartesian dualism,

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
but we may be absolutely sure that there isn't mind stuff and physical stuff

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
or matter and consciousness.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
We know, we say we're modest,

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
but actually we still believe in a kind of experiencing self,

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
the experiencer and the experience,

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
and according to him, and I would agree,

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
this just doesn't fit with what we know about how the brain works at all.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
So that's why he says that when you discard Cartesian dualism,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
as almost everybody does,

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
you can really discard the show that would have gone on in the Cartesian Theatre

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
and the audience as well.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.000
Now, people often throw out the audience or they think they do,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
but it kind of creeps back.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
It's even harder to throw out the show.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
The feeling that I am having a stream of experiences

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
is so compelling that we keep getting back into it,

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
but it makes no sense at all in terms of what's going on in the brain.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
When you look at the visual cortex here at the back of your brain,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
which is a good proportion of your brain,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
the vision is very important in humans.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
You find there's something like 40 parallel pathways going on there,

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
some meet up again and separate out, others don't.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Different information going through the ventral stream and the dorsal stream

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
and doing different jobs,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
and they never come together into some kind of place

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
where the picture is that you see in the world,

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
because you don't actually see a picture in the world.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
We're kind of compelling this feeling that,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
oh, I can see the whole room when you actually,

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
that's another whole story, which I often talk about and written about,

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
but to do with change blindness,

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
inattentional blindness and so on.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
We can show that there isn't that kind of representation.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
There isn't anywhere in the brain where the show happens.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
There's just shows going on all over the place,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
lots and lots and lots of parallel shows.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
What about the self who might be experiencing them?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Well, there's no middle.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
The brain is not organised in such a way that stuff comes in

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
and ends up somewhere and then orders go out.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Not at all.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
There's stuff going through here.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
I mean, the fact that I'm not going to crash into this

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
is all happening very, very far through the dorsal stream,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
straight to motor cortex from eyes,

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
without going through the other part in the ventral stream,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
which does all the perception and decides, oh, it's flowers.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
That happens more slowly.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
They don't come together these things.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
They're separate.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
I know that's kind of weird, but it's important to know that

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
because it helps to kind of throw apart intellectually,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
intellectually throw apart the idea

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
that there's me inside here doing it,

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
and give rise, therefore, to understanding a little bit

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
about what it might mean to say that I am an illusion

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
or the self as an illusion.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
It feels this way, but it really isn't.

04:31.000 --> 04:35.000
It feels, I submit, but I'm pleased to argue for many of you,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
it may not feel this way with an audience like this

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
of people who've generally done a lot of meditation,

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
mindfulness in exploration.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
Oh, here I am.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
It seems to be me.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
It seems to be one me, one me in charge of this body,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
unified, continuous.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
It seems to be, well, it doesn't any more, actually,

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
but it used to seem to be that it was me a few minutes ago,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
and before that it was me and the little girl and so on,

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
that there was something continuous about the me's generated

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
by this brain and this body.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
It seems to be that there's a me having a stream of experiences,

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
and it seems to be that I have some effect on my body.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
I can say.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
I can raise my hand, and I did it.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
Now, there's plenty of psychological evidence, fascinating stuff.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
That's just an illusion.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
We have thoughts.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
No, really, really.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I mean, Libet's work is just the start.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
We have thoughts about an action, say, the action happens.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
There's a correlation.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
They're in that order.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
We jump to the conclusion that one caused the other,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
but we can tell from what's going on in the brain

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
that it isn't like that at all.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
Indeed, we know so much now about the mechanisms of self-control,

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
of decision-making, of choices, and so on,

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
and where they're happening in frontal cortex, prefrontal cortex,

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
and so on, again distributed and so on,

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
and the idea of there being a me who initiates actions is just bonkers,

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
but it still feels that way.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
The science, I think, is therefore very helpful,

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
because it goes on banging here.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
You're not in there.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
There's just this stuff doing something, whatever it is,

06:18.000 --> 06:21.000
and we don't even know fundamentally what it is.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I've said that already.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
There's nowhere in there where it all comes together.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
There's just all this massive parallel processing going on,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
causing this body to these words to come out,

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
and this body not to crash into the pretty flowers.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
So, let's take a different tack.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Let's say...

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
Are you going to come and do something to me again?

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Later.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Let's say I sit in meditation

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
and look for myself.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.000
Or I could do Douglas Harding kind of thing, couldn't I?

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
I look for the person who's looking, and what do I find?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
I find the world.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
I can go round and round.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
I don't find myself as I thought it was.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
I don't find a consistent experiencer of the experiences.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
I find help! I don't know!

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
Instead.

07:39.000 --> 07:44.000
I want to tell you a little bit about some simple explorations.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
I want one particular exploration, actually,

07:46.000 --> 07:51.000
and then I'll kind of wind up with explaining

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
what I called the talk, what I did call it.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Years ago, I used to teach a consciousness course in Bristol.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I did it for about ten years,

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
and it resulted in the textbook that I wrote about consciousness.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I don't know how I got into it,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
but it happened very early on, probably in the first year,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
that I started to get the students to ask a question.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
Every week, they had to ask it hundreds of times,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
as many times as they could every day.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
It's amazingly difficult to get them to do it,

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
and they'd all come, oh, I forgot!

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
And then they'd put stickers on the kettle and stickers on the door,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
and prod each other in pairs to make them remember,

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
and all kinds of tricks, still hard.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I don't know why it's so hard, it is.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
By the way, are you conscious now?

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Well...

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Of course, I love the ones who say, of course,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
that's confidence.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I also like the ones shaking their heads.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
I don't like the people who don't say anything.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Are you conscious now?

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
Great, we love a lovely mixture of yes and no.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
Now, there's a very, very interesting thing about this question.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
This is question number one in week number one of this 20-week course.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Are you conscious now? You've just walked in?

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Are you conscious now?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Doesn't know.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
The odd thing about this question is,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
I know there were some of you saying no,

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
and there are various interesting reasons why you might be saying no.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
But normally, basically, if you ask,

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
am I conscious now, the answer is always yes.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
Did any of you get the odd sensation

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
when I asked you, are you conscious now,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
of sort of, oop, kind of becoming, yeah?

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
It's like, oh, you're becoming conscious because I've asked you.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Yeah? Something like that.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Now, this can be very puzzling,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
because you think to yourself,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
well, of course I was conscious before,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
but then something happened that was different.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
What changed?

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
It felt like I was becoming conscious,

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
but does that mean I wasn't conscious before?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
It's a very odd thing.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
Not all of you will have had it,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
but perhaps if I tap you on the back later on,

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
and you're not being very mindful,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
what was I conscious before?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
So this took me to my next question.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
This, by the way, I wrote a book about this,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
which was originally called Ten's End Questions,

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
and then they decided to bring the paper back out

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
and change the title, which is really irritating.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
So don't go on by both books because they're the same,

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
and it really annoys me,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
but it's a much more trendy title, isn't it,

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Zen and the Art of Consciousness?

10:23.000 --> 10:27.000
Anyway, that peculiar thing that you experienced

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
than a few other people did led me to the second question.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
What was I conscious of a moment ago?

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
I would like you all to ask yourself that question now.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
What was I conscious of a moment ago?

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
Now, I don't know if this works for any of you.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
It took me a long time for this to stabilise,

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
and I mean a long time.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
When I was writing this book,

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
some of the chapters are based on co-un retreats

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
with other people, organised co-un retreats.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Most of them are based on the solitary retreats,

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
which I did on my own,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
either up in the Welsh mountains or at home.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
I would ask the same question hour after hour,

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
day after day, based on simple Zen meditation,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
as I was in.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
Calm the mind for quite a while,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
and just let the question calm when it comes.

11:20.000 --> 11:23.000
What was I conscious of a moment ago?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Okay, I've just done it now.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Now, the obvious thought would be,

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
I was conscious of the words coming out of my mouth,

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
because surely I must have been thinking about them,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
because giving a lecture is quite,

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
you need a bit of attention.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
But I can hear that humming noise over there

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
as though somebody's been listening.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
Hang on, I was sort of faintly aware

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
of a man nodding over there.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
I'd forgotten.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
If I hadn't asked myself the question,

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
that would have gone.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
But it sort of feels as though,

11:52.000 --> 11:55.000
well, there was somebody listening to that noise over there,

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
but it wasn't me,

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
because I was concentrating on what I was saying.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
When I was doing this out in the wilds of the mountains,

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
I would get this sense,

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
or it was more interesting when I was doing it at home,

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
have a meditation hut in the garden.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
Because I was, what was I conscious of a moment ago,

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
and multiple parallel threads would be obvious.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
I hadn't even noticed, because I'm just sitting,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
there's a great drilling going on in the road.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
But when I asked that question,

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
it's as though somebody was listening to the drilling.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
Who was it?

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
Somebody was aware of my bottom sitting on the cushion,

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
and the cat's been purring for ages.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
In fact, I kind of remember the cat

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
turning up and curling up next to me.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
All of these things, when I look backwards,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
so what's going on?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Now, that's the experience, okay?

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
But I'm now jumping to an intellectual interpretation

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
of the experience that might be wrong.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
It's always dangerous to do that.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
But my interpretation,

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
I tried inventing this little graphic this morning,

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
which doesn't quite do it justice,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
but what I'm thinking is something like this.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
Most of the time,

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
most of our lives, most of the time,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
what's happening is what you'd expect

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
in a complex brain, in a complex body, in a complex world.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
There's multiple parallel streams going along,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
and none of them is in consciousness

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
or out of consciousness.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
None of them is what I am experiencing

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
or I'm not experiencing.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
They're all just going along, some bigger than others,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
and that's what these lines are.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Some are ephemeral, very short-lived,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
some are rather longer, some maybe they're ourselves.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Maybe this one, there's a bit of a self-construct going along,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
and we know where these self-constructs are made

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
in the temporal parietal junction,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
is the body image made, and so on.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
So we can track those things if we wanted to.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.000
But what I'm suggesting is there might even be two in parallel.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
There might be several in parallel,

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
the coming and going, shifting,

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
but then, you ask the question, am I conscious now?

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
Or any question you like that propels you into mindfulness?

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
And then what happens?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
All the rest kind of...

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
and they're all brought together,

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
and you go, oh, here I am,

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
and that's fine.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
But you make the mistake.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
This is where the delusion comes about of going,

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
and I was conscious before, and I've been conscious all day.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Somebody mentioned that in a lecture this morning,

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
just with utter confidence, oh, I've been conscious all the time.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
I submit that you haven't.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
And every time this happens,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
which will be many, many times a day

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
if you're practising something like mindfulness

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
and falling out of mindfulness,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
then, if you're mindful all the time,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
then you're staying like this,

14:39.000 --> 14:45.000
then if you keep popping back into it,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
you think it's the same self,

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
or at least that's the delusionary way of thinking about it.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Mindfulness is very interesting

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
because I suspect that in the beginning

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
in mindfulness is that you bring up this self,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
I am being mindful,

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
and that's that transition there.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
And you can keep the self for a long time

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
with practice of mindfulness.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
But I think what happens later on in mindfulness practice

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
is that the self drops out,

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
and possibly awareness can remain

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
of this parallel state in which there isn't a self,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
and then one is seeing clearly only there isn't a self

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
to see clearly, rather there is just experiences

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
without an experiencer.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000
But that's really another issue.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
So, what happened in the last half an hour or so?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
There was a me, because I got quite nervous

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
because there was a problem with the wires.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
I'm thinking, there's a man, full away.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
And there's another one.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
And then there's another one.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
And then there's a whole distracted gap

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
with a whole lot of things going, oh, and here I am again.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
But I'm not, this thing here is not conned

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
into thinking it's the same me.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Partly because of the science,

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
and partly because of the personal enquiry,

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
I say that wasn't the same me.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
And looking forward into the future,

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
it won't be the same me either.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
In a few minutes I'll be, oh, no,

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
in a few minutes I'll be answering your questions, I hope.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
And should a me pop up and a sensation of I'm over here

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
and you're over there and I'm going to answer the questions,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
that will be a new me.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
She won't be me, this one.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
How do we live with this?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
If it's true, it may not be.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
I really like, this is my kind of scientist nature coming out.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Have an idea, have a hypothesis, we'll go and test it.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Right, okay, I'll go and live my life like this

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
and see how it works out and what happens.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
And if I'm wrong, someone can prove me wrong

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
and I'll change your mind, do something else, equally daft maybe.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
But how do we live with this?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
One little trick I've discovered,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
and I would love to hear from other people

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
if any of you have been doing anything similar, is this.

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
It is, I'm going to just discuss three things about it.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
It's learning to let go of her.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
This is very tricky,

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
because as long as I feel that this is me,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
I want to carry on.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
And there's another interesting intellectual question, why?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Why do cells want to carry on?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Why are they so greedy to exist?

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
I don't know where they are.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
So a practice that I've been doing is whenever there's a feeling of,

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
here I am, am I conscious now?

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
Yes, here I am.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
I think and willing to not be.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
In any way, it's only like going to sleep at night, isn't it?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
I mean, you lie down, you think,

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I'm going to stop existing until the morning,

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
and you sort of, that's kind of why going to sleep is such a weird thing.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
But it's sort of the same, going to sleep while awake,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
or disappearing, dying if you like.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
Just, ah, she's allowed to go.

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
Importantly, similar to in meditation,

18:01.000 --> 18:04.000
the dealing with thoughts, it's not go away.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
It's not, oh, here I am, go away.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
No, no, oh, here I am, oh.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
I'll go away at some point.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
Letting her go away.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
That's, I think, quite helpful.

18:15.000 --> 18:21.000
It's also part of this kind of comparison between before and after the question.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
The unified, mindful state of being me experiencing stuff,

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
and the kind of normal everyday parallel processing distracted state.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Looking back into that,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
it reminds me of one of my favourite quotes from William Jaynes,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
who is my great, great hero.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
He tried a lot of introspection,

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
and he said introspection of this kind is like trying to turn up the gas quickly enough

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
to see how the darkness looks.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Of course, he'd have electricity now.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
It would be much quicker, wouldn't it?

18:54.000 --> 18:59.000
And you can't look into the darkness by shining the light.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
Was that any time left or stop now?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Ah, brilliant, thank you.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
So this is an attempt, if you like, to look into the darkness,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
but I can't look into the darkness.

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
But by letting myself go, as it were, her,

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
whoever she is, this one who appears,

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
then maybe the darkness can become light.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
So that's one little trick.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
But one might reasonably have a question about,

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
I call it morality, but I'm not sure I couldn't think of a better word,

19:25.000 --> 19:29.000
but if she won't be me, then why should I care?

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
I mean, if it's not going to be me in the future

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
who's going to suffer the pain or the joy or whatever it is,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
then why should I care about what happens?

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Why should I do anything? Why should I act?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Now, I think many of you would say,

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
well, you don't actually, and I agree, one doesn't.

19:45.000 --> 19:49.000
It's not me who acts, neither scientifically nor experientially.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Actions happen.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.000
Or to quote another Buddhist thing,

19:55.000 --> 19:58.000
actions exist and also their consequences,

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
but the person that acts does not.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
But then why should I care?

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
Well, I think the reason, I'm concerned about this really,

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
because why do I care about her this afternoon if she's not me?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Well, she's kind of similar to me,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
and will have similar memories

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
and similar tendencies to behave,

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
because after all, she's going to be constructed,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
an illusion constructed by this body.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Maybe that's the reason.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
But I think actually more generally,

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
it's only the same as, you know, in general,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
I see suffering all around in the world,

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
and kind of I'd rather people didn't suffer.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
And the same for these selves in the future.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
And this thing here has some capacity to determine,

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
at least the pleasures and sufferings of the similar selves

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
that will come in the future,

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
more than I can do anything for the rest of you.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
So maybe that's enough.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.000
But also I feel a kind of gratitude towards previous selves

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
that put me here.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
I had a lovely time last night.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
I went out after dinner in the woods and it was nearly dark.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.000
It was a bit silly of me,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
because coming back through the woods in the nearly dark

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
was poking my eyes with stick, you know, trees and what have you.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
But it was wonderful out there.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I was marching round and round the trees,

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
thinking what I'm going to say today.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
And I think a sort of mutual gratitude between the prior,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
the previous and the future selves

21:18.000 --> 21:23.000
is also kind of encouraging to nice behaviour

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
rather than nasty behaviour.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
And what about death?

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
Well, all I've been describing is allowing oneself to die again

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
and again all the time.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
So in that sense, it's only the same, isn't it?

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
When the body finally goes,

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
well, all of these rather similar selves will stop,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
but hey, they were all stopping anyway.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
They were all being let go.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.000
And this bugbear about reincarnation.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.000
Like so many western scientists interested in Buddhism

21:53.000 --> 21:59.000
and related ideas, reincarnation does seem stupid.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
What on earth is going to be reincarnated?

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
What's it all about?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
I get in trouble.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
I've had an email thing on one of my blogs

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
with a Buddhist teacher getting really angry with me.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
And I say, I'm not a Buddhist

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
and I can say what I like, actually.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
And so can you.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
And that's fine.

22:17.000 --> 22:20.000
But why I think it's daft is because

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
what I've described as selves can't be reincarnated

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
is nothing personal.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
So what is all this stuff about the cycle of birth and death

22:27.000 --> 22:28.000
or rebirth?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.000
What's that about then?

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
Is it about anything?

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
Well, here's a very different interpretation.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Yes, it is.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
It's actually a very straightforward insight

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
into what it is to be alive.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
It's constantly dying and being born again.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
Selves are rising and falling away.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
And so long as you believe that it's the same self

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
and it's continuous and unitary and has powers

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
and does things and is in charge of its body

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
and all of that, you're still stuck in all of that delusion.

22:54.000 --> 22:58.000
But if you just go, oh, here it comes, here it goes, you're not.

22:58.000 --> 23:04.000
Could that be something about what getting off the rebirth thing is about?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
I don't know.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I throw that in as a pure speculation.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
But let me go back to where I was.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
These selves just pop up.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Oh, here's another one.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
And she'll be about to say goodbye.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
And I hope that makes sense of why I called it She Won't Be Me.
