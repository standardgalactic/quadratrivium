Hey everyone, my name is Olaf and today I will teach you how to render an animation

00:05.960 --> 00:10.840
in Eevee in Blender 2.8 and as always it's going to be quick and easy, so let's get

00:10.840 --> 00:11.840
started.

00:11.840 --> 00:18.180
Okay, so start off by going to the Blender 2.8 website in the description and make sure

00:18.180 --> 00:23.320
to download one of the test files, so let's download Ember Forrest and then go to download

00:23.320 --> 00:28.120
Blender 2.8 beta and then select Blender 2.8.

00:28.120 --> 00:35.720
Okay, so let's open a file in Blender, so go to file and then click open and then select

00:35.720 --> 00:39.760
the file you have and click open Blender file.

00:39.760 --> 00:45.080
Okay, so now we have the Ember Forrest file with the animation, so let's get into the

00:45.080 --> 00:51.200
settings, let's expand it and to the top right you can see the viewport samples and the render

00:51.200 --> 00:56.920
samples, but let's get into the output settings and here you can choose the resolution, the

00:56.920 --> 01:01.320
quality and at the bottom you can choose the output folder for the animation.

01:01.320 --> 01:07.880
So let's click on the folder icon and then select a folder on your computer and then

01:07.880 --> 01:18.400
give the animation a name, so just give it a name and then click enter to save the name

01:18.400 --> 01:25.400
and then you can choose the file format, so you can choose from PNG to JPEG to video

01:25.400 --> 01:29.040
files like AVR JPEG and MP4.

01:29.040 --> 01:34.240
Now to get to the MP4 type format you need to select FFMPEG and then go into encoding

01:34.240 --> 01:40.600
and select MPEG4 and you should also increase the output quality and if you want you can

01:40.600 --> 01:47.800
also add audio to the renderer if you have a audio clip in the animation.

01:47.800 --> 01:52.880
Now for this animation I'm going to choose the AVR JPEG file format because the MP4s

01:52.880 --> 01:59.640
are usually really compressed, so let's choose the AVR JPEG type and then increase the quality

01:59.640 --> 02:09.040
to 100% and let's turn on Render View as well.

02:09.040 --> 02:13.360
There are two ways to render in Blender EV, you can either use the viewport renderer

02:13.360 --> 02:19.320
or the normal renderer, so let's go to view and make a viewport render test which is basically

02:19.320 --> 02:26.200
just a snapshot of the viewport and as you can see the viewport render is really quick

02:26.200 --> 02:31.200
but let's go back to the 3D view, so if you want you can render out the whole animation

02:31.200 --> 02:37.960
using the viewport renderer or you can go to the top left corner of Blender and select

02:37.960 --> 02:45.720
render and then click render image and as you can see when you do a proper render you

02:45.720 --> 02:51.960
get all of the samples specified in the settings, so let's go back to 3D view and render out

02:51.960 --> 02:56.680
the whole animation, so just go up to render and then click render animation and it will

02:56.680 --> 03:01.400
start rendering the whole animation you have and that's it for this tutorial, I hope you

03:01.400 --> 03:05.600
enjoyed it and I will post more EV tutorials very soon, so thank you guys for watching

03:05.600 --> 03:06.480
and subscribe.
