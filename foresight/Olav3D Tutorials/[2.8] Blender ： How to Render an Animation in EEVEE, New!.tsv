0	5960	Hey everyone, my name is Olaf and today I will teach you how to render an animation
5960	10840	in Eevee in Blender 2.8 and as always it's going to be quick and easy, so let's get
10840	11840	started.
11840	18180	Okay, so start off by going to the Blender 2.8 website in the description and make sure
18180	23320	to download one of the test files, so let's download Ember Forrest and then go to download
23320	28120	Blender 2.8 beta and then select Blender 2.8.
28120	35720	Okay, so let's open a file in Blender, so go to file and then click open and then select
35720	39760	the file you have and click open Blender file.
39760	45080	Okay, so now we have the Ember Forrest file with the animation, so let's get into the
45080	51200	settings, let's expand it and to the top right you can see the viewport samples and the render
51200	56920	samples, but let's get into the output settings and here you can choose the resolution, the
56920	61320	quality and at the bottom you can choose the output folder for the animation.
61320	67880	So let's click on the folder icon and then select a folder on your computer and then
67880	78400	give the animation a name, so just give it a name and then click enter to save the name
78400	85400	and then you can choose the file format, so you can choose from PNG to JPEG to video
85400	89040	files like AVR JPEG and MP4.
89040	94240	Now to get to the MP4 type format you need to select FFMPEG and then go into encoding
94240	100600	and select MPEG4 and you should also increase the output quality and if you want you can
100600	107800	also add audio to the renderer if you have a audio clip in the animation.
107800	112880	Now for this animation I'm going to choose the AVR JPEG file format because the MP4s
112880	119640	are usually really compressed, so let's choose the AVR JPEG type and then increase the quality
119640	129040	to 100% and let's turn on Render View as well.
129040	133360	There are two ways to render in Blender EV, you can either use the viewport renderer
133360	139320	or the normal renderer, so let's go to view and make a viewport render test which is basically
139320	146200	just a snapshot of the viewport and as you can see the viewport render is really quick
146200	151200	but let's go back to the 3D view, so if you want you can render out the whole animation
151200	157960	using the viewport renderer or you can go to the top left corner of Blender and select
157960	165720	render and then click render image and as you can see when you do a proper render you
165720	171960	get all of the samples specified in the settings, so let's go back to 3D view and render out
171960	176680	the whole animation, so just go up to render and then click render animation and it will
176680	181400	start rendering the whole animation you have and that's it for this tutorial, I hope you
181400	185600	enjoyed it and I will post more EV tutorials very soon, so thank you guys for watching
185600	186480	and subscribe.
