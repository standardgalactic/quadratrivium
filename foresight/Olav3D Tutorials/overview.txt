1. **Download Blender and a Test File:**
   - Go to the Blender 2.8 website.
   - Download the Ember Forrest test file and Blender 2.8 beta.

2. **Open the File in Blender:**
   - Open Blender and load the downloaded Ember Forrest file.

3. **Explore the Scene:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the scene by expanding the data-blocks and looking at the viewport samples and render samples.

4. **Output Settings:**
   - Access the output settings in the render tab.
   - Set the resolution, quality, and choose an output folder for your animation.
   - Use the folder icon to select a destination on your computer.
   - Save the desired filename for your animation.

5. **Choose File Format:**
   - For animations, you might want to use AVR JPEG or MP4. To render to MP4, you need to:
     - Select FFMPEG in the output settings.
     - Go into the Encoding section and choose MPEG4.
     - Adjust the output quality as needed.
   - Optionally, add audio if you have an audio clip in your animation.

6. **Render Test:**
   - Perform a viewport render test to quickly preview the first frame.

7. **Full Animation Rendering:**
   - For the final render of the entire animation, go to the top left corner and select 'Render'.
   - Choose 'Render Animation' to start rendering the animation at full quality with all specified samples.

8. **Completion:**
   - The animation will be rendered frame by frame using Eevee in Blender 2.8, and once completed, you can view or export your rendered animation.

9. **Future Tutorials:**
   - Stay tuned for more Eevee tutorials from the same creator.

In summary, Olaf has walked you through the process of setting up a scene, configuring output settings, choosing the appropriate file format and quality, performing a test render, and finally rendering the entire animation using Eevee in Blender 2.8. Remember to save your work frequently and keep an eye out for additional tutorials to enhance your animation skills with Eevee.
