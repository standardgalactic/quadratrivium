Hey everyone, my name is Olaf and today I will teach you how to render an animation

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,840
in Eevee in Blender 2.8 and as always it's going to be quick and easy, so let's get

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,840
started.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:18,180
Okay, so start off by going to the Blender 2.8 website in the description and make sure

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,320
to download one of the test files, so let's download Ember Forrest and then go to download

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,120
Blender 2.8 beta and then select Blender 2.8.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:35,720
Okay, so let's open a file in Blender, so go to file and then click open and then select

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,760
the file you have and click open Blender file.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,080
Okay, so now we have the Ember Forrest file with the animation, so let's get into the

10
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,200
settings, let's expand it and to the top right you can see the viewport samples and the render

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,920
samples, but let's get into the output settings and here you can choose the resolution, the

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,320
quality and at the bottom you can choose the output folder for the animation.

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,880
So let's click on the folder icon and then select a folder on your computer and then

14
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:18,400
give the animation a name, so just give it a name and then click enter to save the name

15
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,400
and then you can choose the file format, so you can choose from PNG to JPEG to video

16
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,040
files like AVR JPEG and MP4.

17
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,240
Now to get to the MP4 type format you need to select FFMPEG and then go into encoding

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,600
and select MPEG4 and you should also increase the output quality and if you want you can

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,800
also add audio to the renderer if you have a audio clip in the animation.

20
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,880
Now for this animation I'm going to choose the AVR JPEG file format because the MP4s

21
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,640
are usually really compressed, so let's choose the AVR JPEG type and then increase the quality

22
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:09,040
to 100% and let's turn on Render View as well.

23
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,360
There are two ways to render in Blender EV, you can either use the viewport renderer

24
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,320
or the normal renderer, so let's go to view and make a viewport render test which is basically

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:26,200
just a snapshot of the viewport and as you can see the viewport render is really quick

26
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,200
but let's go back to the 3D view, so if you want you can render out the whole animation

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,960
using the viewport renderer or you can go to the top left corner of Blender and select

28
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:45,720
render and then click render image and as you can see when you do a proper render you

29
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,960
get all of the samples specified in the settings, so let's go back to 3D view and render out

30
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,680
the whole animation, so just go up to render and then click render animation and it will

31
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,400
start rendering the whole animation you have and that's it for this tutorial, I hope you

32
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,600
enjoyed it and I will post more EV tutorials very soon, so thank you guys for watching

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,480
and subscribe.
