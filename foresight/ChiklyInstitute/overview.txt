Checking ChiklyInstitute/Brain Therapy for Neonatal & General Reflexes (BR)： Is There a Neurological Level for Each Reflex？.txt
 Certainly! The discussion revolves around the neonatal and perinatal reflexes that are present at birth and their integration or inhibition as a child grows. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Number of Reflexes**: At birth, a human being has up to 40 reflexes active for survival. These reflexes integrate or stay active for different durations, with some integrating by three months, six months, or remaining until the age of three years or more.

2. **Integration and Inhibition**: The integration of these reflexes is crucial for normal development. If certain reflexes remain unintegrated or persistent into later childhood or adulthood, it can lead to a variety of issues, including learning disabilities (like dyslexia, dyscalculia), balance problems, emotional difficulties, and even spiritual challenges.

3. **Common Reflexes**: Examples of such reflexes include the fear paralysis reflex (startle response) and the grasping reflex. These can reactivate in adults under stress or trauma, leading to regression to more primitive behaviors.

4. **Treatment**: The primary treatment approach for persistent reflexes involves movement exercises that gently inhibit these reflexes. This process can be time-consuming and requires consistent practice, often multiple times a day over several months.

5. **Impact on Aging**: In older adults, some of these reflexes can re-emerge due to aging or pathologies such as stroke, Parkinson's, dementia, etc. This can manifest in behaviors like increased oral activities (eating, chewing) or a tightening of the grip.

6. **Developmental Disorders**: Persistent neonatal reflexes are associated with developmental disorders such as sensory processing disorder, trauma and PTSD, cerebral palsy (CP), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and others.

7. **Scientific Evidence**: The presentation emphasizes the importance of hands-on testing and palpation (like that done in NeuroDevelopmental Treatment - NDT) to assess these reflexes, as opposed to relying solely on theoretical models or assumptions about where in the brainstem or central nervous system these reflexes might be located.

8. **Resources**: The speaker mentions resources such as YouTube videos that demonstrate gentle treatment methods for these reflexes.

In summary, the proper integration of neonatal and perinatal reflexes is essential for healthy development across all aspects of human functioning. Persistent or unintegrated reflexes can lead to a range of issues throughout life, and targeted movement exercises can help inhibit these reflexes effectively.
