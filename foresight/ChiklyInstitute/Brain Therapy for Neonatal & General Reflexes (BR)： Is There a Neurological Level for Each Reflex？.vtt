00:00.000 --> 00:06.400
Let's go over this question about the brain reflex. We work on those reflexes, and you remember that

00:06.400 --> 00:10.720
you have about, I said 28 because we don't count some reflexes that are left, right, up, down.

00:10.720 --> 00:17.360
You can have to 40 reflex at birth that are active for survival. The first one that we know,

00:17.360 --> 00:23.440
but you may start earlier, is the fear paralysis reflex, which is an equivalent of a frozen

00:23.440 --> 00:28.960
response. We feel the baby touching the wall of the uterus between five and seven weeks

00:28.960 --> 00:33.840
in trial uterus. And most of those reflexes, we see them integrate three months, six months,

00:33.840 --> 00:38.800
some stay up to three years. But if you go to school today and you test seven years old,

00:38.800 --> 00:45.120
nine years old, 15 years old, you feel that they have a lot of reflex not integrated steel. And

00:45.120 --> 00:52.000
that is going to create a lot of problems. And sometimes I describe this as a tadpole that needs

00:52.080 --> 00:58.160
their tail in water to be able to move. But once a tadpole turn into a frog,

00:58.880 --> 01:03.600
you don't want your tail when it's time to jump. You need to have those two to regress,

01:03.600 --> 01:09.600
not be active anymore. And unfortunately, when your reflex is still active, after six months or

01:09.600 --> 01:14.560
after three years, depending on the reflex, it creates a lot of problems. One of them is learning

01:14.560 --> 01:20.800
and it could be balance posture, memory, math problem, all kinds of things, including emotional

01:20.800 --> 01:26.000
problem, postural, mental, emotional, even spiritual problem. So it's really something and

01:26.000 --> 01:30.640
many team look into it, but the main treatment are movement. So there's one called the grasping

01:30.640 --> 01:36.400
reflex. You still grasp. And if you do movement like that, once or twice a day for six months before

01:36.400 --> 01:40.640
you inhibit the reflex, it makes the parents so tired of doing it every day that kids are so

01:40.640 --> 01:45.440
sick of it. It takes a long time. It takes a few months up to six months. So it's very long.

01:45.520 --> 01:51.200
So we find a way to gently being able to inhibit those reflexes. We have those reflexes that also

01:51.200 --> 01:57.040
come back, especially after a trauma, emotional trauma in adults. So when you see someone that's

01:57.040 --> 02:03.360
very nice and very balanced and very polite, put in a stressful situation, and you have seen that

02:03.360 --> 02:09.120
all of you, someone that regress begin to be like, begin to be an animal. In the worst case,

02:09.120 --> 02:15.040
when you have this, you regress in the hierarchy of your nervous system. And most probably,

02:15.040 --> 02:21.120
you reactivate one of those primary reflex, rather than use a sophisticated behavior,

02:21.120 --> 02:26.960
a location, talk, and movement, you're going to go back into a very primitive way. Whatever you

02:26.960 --> 02:34.160
regress into, you most probably have one of those neonatal reflex or perinatal reflex that are

02:34.160 --> 02:39.120
reactivated. So they can reactivate emotionally or there's a stress, there's a fire, but they can

02:39.120 --> 02:46.000
also happen if you have a stroke, if you have Parkinson's, dementia, brain cancer, something

02:46.000 --> 02:51.280
like this. So it happened in adults, and especially when you see people in old age bent in half,

02:51.280 --> 02:55.280
that's a reflex that come back. Sometimes if you go to your grandpa, they begin to like to put a lot

02:55.280 --> 03:00.240
of things in their mouth, sucking reflex, they grab your hand, they don't let go, grasping reflex,

03:00.240 --> 03:06.080
you need to re-inhibit them at some point with aging. And especially if you had some pathologies

03:06.160 --> 03:11.920
described here in the slides. In kids, it's an enormous amount of problem that can happen to them,

03:11.920 --> 03:17.120
and you often discover them when they have school problem, learning problem. And you have a list

03:17.120 --> 03:25.360
here from sensory disorder, trauma, PTSD, CP, ASD, autism, ADHD, ADHD. So any kind of problem

03:25.360 --> 03:31.600
at mass focus, concentration, writing problem, vestibular balance problem, posterior problem,

03:31.600 --> 03:37.360
social skills, they can be really isolated in their tower, they can be really aggressive, dyslexia,

03:37.360 --> 03:43.760
dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyspraxia, speech developmental disorder, auditory and visual processing,

03:43.760 --> 03:49.200
autism, Downstream, etc. All those things going to tell you, wow, this is a red flag to use one

03:49.200 --> 03:54.640
of those reflexes. So those reflexes become not integrated, not inhibited, we call that

03:54.640 --> 03:59.120
retina reflex, all those were the synonyms. These reflexes are persistent in adults.

03:59.120 --> 04:03.520
This there's a description I found somewhere of this and that reflex is in the brainstem,

04:03.520 --> 04:06.960
this reflex in the medial axis, this reflex in the midbrain, this affects in the cortex,

04:06.960 --> 04:12.880
but this is absolutely not what we find. This is not really scientific. Any reflex can be

04:12.880 --> 04:17.360
searched anywhere in the central nervous system. This is one of the questions I see a lot. And

04:17.360 --> 04:22.000
some would describe that, but that's absolutely not what we find when we test and palpate.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.520
Because there's a theory, there's no imaging done on that, they're just an assumption. When you feel

04:27.520 --> 04:31.680
with your hand and that's the benefit of feeding, you can really see what's happening. You don't feel

04:31.680 --> 04:36.320
that at all. Any reflex can be stuck anywhere. That was a question, basically. I just went over

04:36.320 --> 04:41.360
to give you an overview. This is brain reflex, brain neonatal reflex. And the treatment is very,

04:41.360 --> 04:47.600
very gentle. Just type on YouTube, reflex and cheeky. And you could see us working with a lot

04:47.600 --> 04:54.240
of reflex, see how gentle and how fast it is to treat with like six or eight videos on the brain.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.240
Brain reflex is really, really fast.
