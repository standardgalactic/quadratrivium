0	6400	Let's go over this question about the brain reflex. We work on those reflexes, and you remember that
6400	10720	you have about, I said 28 because we don't count some reflexes that are left, right, up, down.
10720	17360	You can have to 40 reflex at birth that are active for survival. The first one that we know,
17360	23440	but you may start earlier, is the fear paralysis reflex, which is an equivalent of a frozen
23440	28960	response. We feel the baby touching the wall of the uterus between five and seven weeks
28960	33840	in trial uterus. And most of those reflexes, we see them integrate three months, six months,
33840	38800	some stay up to three years. But if you go to school today and you test seven years old,
38800	45120	nine years old, 15 years old, you feel that they have a lot of reflex not integrated steel. And
45120	52000	that is going to create a lot of problems. And sometimes I describe this as a tadpole that needs
52080	58160	their tail in water to be able to move. But once a tadpole turn into a frog,
58880	63600	you don't want your tail when it's time to jump. You need to have those two to regress,
63600	69600	not be active anymore. And unfortunately, when your reflex is still active, after six months or
69600	74560	after three years, depending on the reflex, it creates a lot of problems. One of them is learning
74560	80800	and it could be balance posture, memory, math problem, all kinds of things, including emotional
80800	86000	problem, postural, mental, emotional, even spiritual problem. So it's really something and
86000	90640	many team look into it, but the main treatment are movement. So there's one called the grasping
90640	96400	reflex. You still grasp. And if you do movement like that, once or twice a day for six months before
96400	100640	you inhibit the reflex, it makes the parents so tired of doing it every day that kids are so
100640	105440	sick of it. It takes a long time. It takes a few months up to six months. So it's very long.
105520	111200	So we find a way to gently being able to inhibit those reflexes. We have those reflexes that also
111200	117040	come back, especially after a trauma, emotional trauma in adults. So when you see someone that's
117040	123360	very nice and very balanced and very polite, put in a stressful situation, and you have seen that
123360	129120	all of you, someone that regress begin to be like, begin to be an animal. In the worst case,
129120	135040	when you have this, you regress in the hierarchy of your nervous system. And most probably,
135040	141120	you reactivate one of those primary reflex, rather than use a sophisticated behavior,
141120	146960	a location, talk, and movement, you're going to go back into a very primitive way. Whatever you
146960	154160	regress into, you most probably have one of those neonatal reflex or perinatal reflex that are
154160	159120	reactivated. So they can reactivate emotionally or there's a stress, there's a fire, but they can
159120	166000	also happen if you have a stroke, if you have Parkinson's, dementia, brain cancer, something
166000	171280	like this. So it happened in adults, and especially when you see people in old age bent in half,
171280	175280	that's a reflex that come back. Sometimes if you go to your grandpa, they begin to like to put a lot
175280	180240	of things in their mouth, sucking reflex, they grab your hand, they don't let go, grasping reflex,
180240	186080	you need to re-inhibit them at some point with aging. And especially if you had some pathologies
186160	191920	described here in the slides. In kids, it's an enormous amount of problem that can happen to them,
191920	197120	and you often discover them when they have school problem, learning problem. And you have a list
197120	205360	here from sensory disorder, trauma, PTSD, CP, ASD, autism, ADHD, ADHD. So any kind of problem
205360	211600	at mass focus, concentration, writing problem, vestibular balance problem, posterior problem,
211600	217360	social skills, they can be really isolated in their tower, they can be really aggressive, dyslexia,
217360	223760	dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyspraxia, speech developmental disorder, auditory and visual processing,
223760	229200	autism, Downstream, etc. All those things going to tell you, wow, this is a red flag to use one
229200	234640	of those reflexes. So those reflexes become not integrated, not inhibited, we call that
234640	239120	retina reflex, all those were the synonyms. These reflexes are persistent in adults.
239120	243520	This there's a description I found somewhere of this and that reflex is in the brainstem,
243520	246960	this reflex in the medial axis, this reflex in the midbrain, this affects in the cortex,
246960	252880	but this is absolutely not what we find. This is not really scientific. Any reflex can be
252880	257360	searched anywhere in the central nervous system. This is one of the questions I see a lot. And
257360	262000	some would describe that, but that's absolutely not what we find when we test and palpate.
262000	267520	Because there's a theory, there's no imaging done on that, they're just an assumption. When you feel
267520	271680	with your hand and that's the benefit of feeding, you can really see what's happening. You don't feel
271680	276320	that at all. Any reflex can be stuck anywhere. That was a question, basically. I just went over
276320	281360	to give you an overview. This is brain reflex, brain neonatal reflex. And the treatment is very,
281360	287600	very gentle. Just type on YouTube, reflex and cheeky. And you could see us working with a lot
287600	294240	of reflex, see how gentle and how fast it is to treat with like six or eight videos on the brain.
294240	296240	Brain reflex is really, really fast.
