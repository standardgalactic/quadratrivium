1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
Yeah, no, I will. So Matthew, when, when, when you start this string, just send me a

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,000
a notification, send me a little message and I'll, okay, the stream should be started.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:35,400
Yeah, the streams should be started. Amazing. Amazing. Okay. So could the chat on YouTube

4
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,440
just confirm that they can hear what I'm saying? And then somebody in the chat on YouTube confirmed

5
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:50,120
they can hear what I'm saying. And then I'll, because we haven't done this before. Yes, amazing.

6
00:00:50,120 --> 00:01:00,880
People can hear me. So hello, everyone. Welcome. Welcome to the annual Maxwell talk and Maxwell

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,960
lecture, which is co-hosted by the Cambridge University Physics Society and the Archimedes. The

8
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,600
talk this year will be given by Professor Anthony C, who's going to talk about quantum field theory

9
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:22,600
in a nutshell. Now, Anthony C holds a joint appointment as a permanent member of the Cavalier

10
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:29,040
Institute for Theoretical Physics and is also a professor at the University of California,

11
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,680
Santa Barbara. His main areas of research involve cosmology and the fundamental structures of

12
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,400
matter. And he's well known in the physics community for his unusual breadth of interest from

13
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:49,560
condensed matter physics to biophysics to high energy physics. And C obtained his PhD from

14
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,560
Howard in 1970, supervised by Sydney Coleman. And in the following years, he worked at the Institute

15
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:08,280
of Advanced Study and was the Alfred P. Sloan Fellow. In his first year as assistant professor at

16
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:15,400
Princeton, C had Ed Whitten as his teaching assistant. Professor C has authored and co-authored

17
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,920
more than 200 scientific publications and several books. He's written in particle physics, condensed

18
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,440
matter physics, anomalies in physics, random matrix theory, supergun activity, and many more.

19
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,640
We are very honored to have him with us here today to talk about quantum field theory.

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,640
Before we start the event, I would like to thank our sponsors, Seamless, Riverlane, TTP, TPP,

21
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,720
Define, JaneStream, and CGT for helping make this possible. And with that, I will let you have

22
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,680
added C after actually just pointing out four questions. If you post them in the YouTube chat,

23
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,200
we will be watching this. And if you have any interesting questions, I will read them out

24
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,280
and see, would you prefer to, oh, Tony, would you prefer to have questions during the talk or

25
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:13,720
afterwards? I think it would be better to have the questions after the talk. Okay, then we will have

26
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,920
the questions after the talk, but post them in the chat and we will keep tabs. And then I will

27
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:28,120
hand it over to you. Thank you very much, Oscar. I'm very honored to be giving the Maxwell lecture

28
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:37,800
for this year. So today, I'm going to talk about quantum field theory. And here is a picture of

29
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:46,120
the field, the lovely quantum field that we all would like to explore. Okay, so

30
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,640
quantum field theory is arguably the greatest monument to the human intellect.

31
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,600
Now, already you can hear the humanities professor snatching the teeth on the side.

32
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:06,520
But in any case, whatever, it is the most accurately tested theory in physics. This comes

33
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:15,400
as a surprise to some people. But as we will see for various reasons, it's tested to an extremely

34
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:25,080
high degree of accuracy, more than any other areas of physics. So it took us a couple of millennia

35
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,760
before we realized that the universe is actually pervaded with quantum fields. And in fact, as you

36
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:41,640
listen to this talk, you're surrounded by quantum fields. So today, this talk is addressed to students

37
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,320
and to people who do not know what quantum field theory is. So I'm going to start

38
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,600
with the question, what is quantum field theory and who needs quantum field theory?

39
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:01,080
And these days, actually, one doesn't even need to know quantum mechanics to be a professor

40
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:08,360
theoretical physics. Now, in this talk, I should caution the audience that whenever I speak about

41
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,800
physics, I mean theoretical physics, because that's what I know. I'm not speaking

42
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:23,640
of this. For whom I have only admiration, since they can do things that I cannot even dream of doing.

43
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:33,400
So who needs quantum field theory? And this is chapter 1.1 of my textbook on quantum field theory

44
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,320
is, in fact, the very first chapter. The book starts with the sentence, quantum field theory

45
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:47,160
arose out of our need to describe the ephemeral nature of life. This sentence was so widely quoted

46
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:55,000
that I now see it on the web in collection of quotes to my amusement. But what do I mean by that?

47
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,800
I'll explain. So the ephemeral nature of life, there's a saying about that, that life is just

48
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:14,680
like clouds and smoke, assing in front of our very eyes. And it's soon over. So, but more seriously,

49
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:22,040
there was meant to be a joke, but quantum field theory is needed when we confront simultaneously

50
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:28,680
the two great physics innovations of the last century of the previous millennium, namely special

51
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:38,600
relativity and quantum mechanics. And here I show you what I call the square of physics. So on this

52
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:47,720
axis, I've plotted the size of the objects involved. And on this axis, I've plotted whether the

53
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,480
objects involved are moving slowly or fast. So in this corner, we have Newtonian mechanics,

54
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:04,600
the classical physics of Newton, Maxwell, and Laplace. And as we go to smaller objects, we have

55
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:11,320
slow moving electrons scattering over proton, for example. There's no need for special relativity,

56
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:18,040
but you definitely need quantum mechanics. Now, we move up to this axis. Then, for example,

57
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,480
rocket ship moving near light speed, there's no need for quantum mechanics, but you definitely

58
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:29,560
need special relativity. So what we're interested in is moving into this

59
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,040
upper right corner, in which we have the marriage of quantum mechanics and special

60
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,680
relativity. And it's in this peculiar confluence of special relativity and quantum mechanics

61
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:50,760
that a new set of phenomena arises. Particles can be born and particles and die.

62
00:07:51,720 --> 00:08:01,960
So this is a new subject in physics is required, a quantum field theory, to describe the birth and

63
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:08,520
death of some kind of life in between. So in particle, in classical physics, there's no such thing

64
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:18,760
of objects being born or objects going away. There's no such thing as birth and death. So this

65
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:27,640
is introduced by a new phenomenon, totally new phenomenon in physics. So let's remind ourselves

66
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:35,160
of two gold-plated equations of physics. The gold-plated equation of physics of quantum mechanics

67
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:43,240
is the uncertainty principle. So we're familiar with the fact that the uncertainty

68
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:51,640
in momentum times the uncertainty in position is equal to h bar, plans constant. So I'll set

69
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,240
plans constant equal to one for the purpose of this talk. So another version of the uncertainty

70
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:05,480
principle is that the uncertainty in energy is equal to one divided by the uncertainty in time.

71
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:14,120
So the advertising slogan for this gold-plated equation is that accounting errors could be

72
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:20,600
tolerated for a short time. So for a very short time, nature has to keep track of the conservation

73
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:27,720
of energy. But for a very short time, you could have some uncertainty in the energy.

74
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,440
Now, special relativity, on the other hand, tells us that energy is equal to matter,

75
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:41,400
and even the person, the man and woman in the street, know about the gold-plated equation of

76
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:47,160
special relativity, e equal to mc squared. And the advertising slogan for this is that counting

77
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:56,040
errors could be turning to stuff. So in one of my popular books, I spoke of an embezzler

78
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:04,600
working at a bank. So for a very short time, accounting errors could be tolerated. And of

79
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:12,840
course, the smaller the accounting error, it could be hidden for a long time. But if you take away

80
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:20,440
and walk away with $10 million, clearly that would be discovered very quickly. But that is just

81
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,440
fluctuations and accounting errors in quantum mechanics. But it's only with special relativity

82
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,280
that the accounting errors could be turned into stuff than Bezler could then buy himself or herself

83
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:42,200
and Lamborghini. So when we combine these two equations, particles could pop out of the vacuum

84
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:50,440
and they can pop into the vacuum. Parts can come into being and disappear. There's birth and death

85
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:58,040
in physics. So in order for this to happen, we need, as we can see from the previous transparency,

86
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,960
that we need both quantum physics and special relativity. One of them is not enough. We need

87
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:14,280
both. But these particles could not exist for a long time unless we know of two ways for them to

88
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:23,960
exist for a long time, which is that if extra energy is available, or if this is happening near

89
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:30,680
Black Hole Horizon. Now in contrast, I think many people in the audience have studied

90
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,240
non relativistic quantum mechanics, which is the subject before quantum field theory.

91
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,600
In non relativistic quantum mechanics, you have the Schrodinger equation. So no matter how you

92
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,440
shake and bake the Schrodinger equation, it's always the same number of particles. But you

93
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,240
cannot create more or less. If the Schrodinger equation describes three electrons, you're always

94
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:02,600
going to end up with three electrons. So let us now talk about fields. The concept of fields,

95
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:16,120
a heuristic pictorial motivation for a field is what I call a mattress. Well, a mattress is just a

96
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:27,480
bunch of points, mass points, point masses connected by springs in some lattice. So very far away on

97
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,040
distance scales much larger than the lattice spacing, this looks like a continuous field.

98
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,360
So if we're interested in physics on a distance scale much larger than the spacing between the

99
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:44,840
lattice, then this looks like a continuous field. And we can press down bounce up and down on this

100
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:52,440
mattress. And we can set up normal modes, vibrational modes, and we can form wave packets of these modes

101
00:12:53,240 --> 00:13:03,240
and localize wave packets. So we can form a vibrational disturbance located in one area of the

102
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:14,920
of the mattress. And we can set this wave packet moving. So these wave packets can move around.

103
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:22,520
And if the springs are perfectly harmonic, then nothing much happens. But if the springs

104
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:31,480
have any amount of n-harmonicity, this would cause us the wave packets to motion with no

105
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,720
longer be harmonic. And these wave packets would scatter and decay and dissipate and so on.

106
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:46,360
So this was seized upon by the founders of quantum field theory in the early days

107
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:53,800
to perhaps could be used to represent particles, the particles that they were discovering at that time

108
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,280
right around the century. So right around the turn of the 20th century, for example,

109
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Thompson discovering the electron. So let us consider a space-time diagram. If this is space,

110
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:13,640
this is time, then I could set up a disturbance here. And we could see in particles a packet of

111
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:19,560
energy and momentum moving in space-time. And then could be absorbed at some other location,

112
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:28,200
okay, on this mattress. So this, of course, in 30 seconds is the concept of going from a field

113
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:39,880
to a particle. Now, of course, I'm hardly describing quantum field theory in detail here,

114
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:46,120
but I'm just trying to motivate in some cartoon feature how a field, how the concept of field

115
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:54,120
could lead to a particle. Now going to the next slide, we go from the next step is to go from

116
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:02,840
particle to force. And I imagine a particle going back and forth. So this caption, I'm sorry, is

117
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:09,880
rather small. On this cartoon, it says the pie meson, the pion, is a marriage broker of old.

118
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:19,320
It's a rather obese lady going back and forth between two families. So this was strung from

119
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:25,000
me by an undergraduate a long time ago. The book was published 30 years ago. So

120
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:32,440
she must be quite grown by now. So in many cultures, we have marriage brokers going back and forth.

121
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:39,480
And by traveling back and forth, it produces an attraction between two families. So you could

122
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,880
think of the attraction between the two families as some kind of attractive force. So this is the

123
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,040
first inkling that quantum field theory could explain the forces we see in nature. We're going to

124
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:59,640
look at this in more detail. Well, you may be curious about where this cartoon comes from.

125
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:10,040
It is in fact taken from one of my books, Fearful Symmetry. I guess I have to go here.

126
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:20,920
So this book was written in around 1984. Steve, I was planning to write a book on quantum field

127
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:27,080
theory. But Steve Weinberg advised me that I should write a popular book before a textbook

128
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,520
on quantum field theory. And his reasoning, I think, is very sound. A lot of physicists

129
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:49,080
write textbooks about any idea on how to communicate things to people. And Weinberg told me that if

130
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:56,680
you could explain things to the general public, then you'll qualify to write a textbook. So I

131
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:05,880
write to this advice and that helps people. Now, so excuse me. My book on Fearful Symmetry,

132
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:16,760
I show you the French translation here. And as you can see, Fearful, the French told me that

133
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,720
Fearful doesn't make any sense. You cannot have symmetry that are fearful. So you can see that

134
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:31,160
they change Fearful to some other word. So, but it was another amusing aside is that it

135
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:37,960
took 34 years since my book was published in 1984. Immediately after it was published,

136
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,360
it was translated into German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and so on. But French translation,

137
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:50,600
there was never a French translation. I was very puzzled by that. Until 2018, a couple years ago,

138
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:59,080
I took a sabbatical and I lived in Paris for a year. And as soon as I have a French address,

139
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:05,400
I have an address in Paris, the French publishers immediately took it seriously. And in fact,

140
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,960
in one day, I got two offers to translate my book. So that's just very amusing. So having,

141
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:20,040
I could tell you all that having an address in Paris is very high importance as far as the French

142
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:30,920
is concerned. Okay, so the Germans invited me to India to the Max Mule Baban. And the trip was

143
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:38,920
paid for by the United States State Department. I was quite surprised. And after this book came out.

144
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:51,560
And this is in fact, an article in the newspaper in Calcutta. But the title totally floored me.

145
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:59,880
It was somehow they treated me as a religious cult leader of some kind. So anyhow, after I came

146
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,840
back, I gave a talk in Mumbai. And this was then published in New Literary History, which is a

147
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,960
humanities journal published in the United States by the University of Virginia. And people

148
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:19,320
were always surprised. But so I went into this story to explain to you. When people look up this

149
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:25,560
article, they notice it's illustrated by works of Indian art. And that is why because the talk was

150
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:36,760
given in India. So I digressed a little bit into where that cartoon comes from. But I remind

151
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:42,920
you, it was a marriage broker going between two families and generating an attraction between the

152
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:51,560
two families. Now, this leads to my third theme, to the theme of particles to force my second theme,

153
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:58,120
sorry. Since the early days of physics, the notion of force has been among the most basic and the

154
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:06,120
most mysterious. So it was with considerable satisfaction that physicists finally understood

155
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:12,520
where forces come from. Their forces come from quantum exchange of a particle. I want to emphasize

156
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:19,480
this point. We are all students of physics. And when you first study physics, you learn about

157
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,240
forces. But if you ask the professor, where did the forces come from, they cannot answer you,

158
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:32,200
unless they know quantum field. Forces come from the quantum exchange of a particle. And that's one

159
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,440
one of the important results of quantum field theory. And given this understanding of the nature

160
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:46,920
of force in 1934, the Japanese physicist Yukawa Hideki Yukawa, whom I think many of you have heard

161
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:53,400
of, he decided that some kind of marriage broker must be provided for the strong interaction.

162
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:02,920
And so he hypothesized a new particle. And this is the pi meson. So this comes from the talk I

163
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:08,520
already mentioned to you that I gave him on by, and in fact, interestingly, it was at the National

164
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:21,080
Center for the Performing Arts. Now, the third theme that I now get to is going from particle to

165
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:27,880
force. So remember, I went from the mattress to field, from field to particle, and now I go from

166
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:34,920
particle to force. So another rough analogy, other than the marriage broker analogy that people use,

167
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:42,600
I think John Wheeler had used this a long time ago, that's to imagine two lumps on the mattress,

168
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,960
and they attract due to the distortion of the field.

169
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:57,080
So the physical world that we know results from the web of interactions.

170
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,360
And some attractive and some repulsive. I'm going to move my laptop closer to me.

171
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:13,560
Quantum field theory answers why. So again, when we started studying physics,

172
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,320
the professors tell us some forces are attractive and some forces are repulsive.

173
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:29,240
Now, to be able to compare what is attractive or repulsive, let's talk about between like objects,

174
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:37,880
so between the same objects. But if you ask the professor why, there is no why. So physicists

175
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,960
did not understand why some forces are attractive and why some forces are repulsive. In the physics

176
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,960
course, that's usually just stated as a fact. You take it as an experimental fact or else,

177
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:59,160
but quantum field theory actually tells you why. It turns out the sign depends on whether the spin

178
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:05,640
of the mediating particle is odd or even. Now, to me, this is a really profound result. I first

179
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,720
heard about this from Julian Schwinger when I took a quantum field theory course from him at Harvard,

180
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,560
and I was really blown away that there's such a simple rule that explains the universe,

181
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,760
whether some forces are attractive and some forces are repulsive.

182
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:28,600
And if you do the calculation, as I do in my book, you can see that the sign ultimately

183
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,280
could be traced to the difference between time and space. Because in the Minkowski metric,

184
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,800
for those of you who know what a Minkowski metric is,

185
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:45,560
there is a sign flip between time and space. So according to this rule,

186
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:52,200
then spin zero produces an attraction, and this is a strong nuclear force, the protons

187
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:58,520
and neutrons coming together. And that's exactly how Yukawa introduced the whole concept in the

188
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:05,720
first place. Then you need a spin zero particle to produce the strong force that holds the nucleus

189
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:14,200
together. And the spin one then produces a repulsion, and we all know that electromagnetism

190
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:25,960
like charges repel. So spin two, we go to spin two, and that's again an attraction. So just an

191
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:33,320
even on, so simple, so beautiful, it's amazing that this explains the universe. So that's gravity,

192
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:39,720
the graviton carries spin two, and that produces an attraction between the apple and Newton's head.

193
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:50,280
So this allows us to give a lightning history of the universe. The universal gravitation attraction

194
00:24:50,280 --> 00:25:00,200
of Newton, which is due to the spin two particle, produces the instability that drives the formation

195
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:06,920
of structure in the early universe. Right, dense regions become denser still. That's because in

196
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:12,920
gravity everything attracts. So if you have some fluctuation in density in some region of the early

197
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:19,240
universe, where there's more matter than in other regions, these dense regions become denser. They

198
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:25,880
pull and matter to them, matter forward towards the denser regions. And this is a well-known

199
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:34,280
phenomenon in the universe, not only in the early universe, but also in our world. We all

200
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:42,680
know that the rich becomes richer. Now meanwhile, the photons and neutrinos, they're free streaming

201
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:48,360
because their interaction with the primeval matter was very weak, especially the neutrinos.

202
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,320
And so it's a kind of taxation. They take some of the energy and mass density away from the

203
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:03,080
dense region. And finally, the attraction between the protons due to the spin zero particle

204
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:11,400
of Yukawa ignites the stars and eventually form the rich variety of nuclei. And then finally,

205
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:20,040
these positively charged nuclei and the negatively charged electrons attract each other

206
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:28,600
due to the spin one particle and they produce atoms. And so the rest is history, as you know,

207
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:38,600
that eventually leads to us. So it's a beautiful history of the universe. And the entire history is,

208
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,560
according to quantum field theory, just based on this interplay between plus and minus signs.

209
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:53,560
Okay, the concept of field goes back to Faraday.

210
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:03,480
And Faraday is a remarkable person because he came up from almost a Kenzian

211
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,960
poverty. And without proper education, the mathematics of the continental philosophers

212
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:17,160
were beyond Faraday, who was compelled to invent his own pictorial language. So

213
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,320
the mathematics of the continental philosophers that Faraday said you could not possibly understand,

214
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,920
it just partial differential equations, which now every undergraduate in physics knows.

215
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,000
So but Faraday, since he didn't know any mathematics here to introduce the concept

216
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:44,840
of a field, imagine a field mediating between charged bodies. Now here I cannot resist

217
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:52,600
making a side remark about basic versus applied research. So if you were in charge of the Royal

218
00:27:52,600 --> 00:28:02,360
Navy at the 19th century at the time of Faraday, would you support the research of a bunch of

219
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:07,880
strange people in the basement messing around with wires and frogs or with people who are trying

220
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:15,400
to breed stronger pigeons? Okay, so I say this because all around the world, certainly in the

221
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:23,080
United States, but in other countries as well that I have spent time in, in the last 10, 20 years,

222
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:30,680
there's a tremendous shift from theoretical to applied physics. Now Faraday is one of my great

223
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:43,160
heroes. And for obvious reasons, since he invented the word field. And a few months ago, I was invited

224
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:51,320
to give a talk at the Royal Institution in London. And I deeply regretted that because of this

225
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:58,520
epidemic, this pandemic, I was not able to lecture at the same platform that Faraday lectured from.

226
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:06,200
But I certainly talked of my, spoke of my admiration for Faraday. And I think that

227
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:15,000
physics students should look at Faraday's life as an inspiration. So now from Faraday, we get to Maxwell.

228
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:23,400
Maxwell's theory of the electromagnetic field, as we know, it contains two hidden symmetries

229
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:32,120
that will rock 20th century physics. One is relativistic invariance and the other is gauge

230
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:40,520
invariance. Now both of these symmetries were already contained in Maxwell's theory. But nobody,

231
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:49,640
including Maxwell, nobody in the 20th century, in the 19th century, noticed it. And so is it

232
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,800
conceivable that our present day theory also contains all kinds of hidden structure?

233
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:04,440
To me, that's, that's a possibility. Hidden structure that's waiting for young people

234
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:12,760
to discover. Just like Einstein discovered relativistic invariance hidden in Maxwell's

235
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:21,160
equation and Hermann Weyl discovers gauge invariance in Maxwell's theory. So in hindsight,

236
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:27,080
how is it that Maxwell did not see this? Well, I don't know how many of you have read Maxwell's

237
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:34,840
treatise. Okay, it's a terrible notation of the 19th century. Since he doesn't have vectors

238
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:41,560
and index notation, he writes out every component of everything. So nowadays, we think of four

239
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,440
Maxwell's equations or something like this. But for Maxwell, it was actually like 26 equations.

240
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:53,960
Everything is written down in component form. So when I teach electromagnetism in the United

241
00:30:53,960 --> 00:31:02,920
States, I always ask the student why the magnetic field is called H. And I have almost never encountered

242
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:09,320
students who can answer this question. So I'll let you think about that. And this comes to another

243
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:16,760
one of my pet peeve, at least about American students, very few students are interested in

244
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:23,400
the history of physics. And personally, and I think quite a few of my colleagues around the world,

245
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:30,920
I just got an email from somebody in Germany, who agreed with me completely, that you really

246
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:36,200
cannot call yourself a theoretical physicist, if you don't know anything about the history of the

247
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:46,680
subject. But now Yang-Mills theory also has a terrible notation, because it's a redundancy in

248
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:52,200
description, those of you who study Yang-Mills theory or gauge theory, know that it has a lot of

249
00:31:52,200 --> 00:32:00,040
redundant variables that have to be gotten rid of at the end of the day. So perhaps the twister

250
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,040
formalism of Roger Penrose is perhaps the first step in fixing this. By the way,

251
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,240
I've given this talk since my quantum field theory book came out something like 20 years ago,

252
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,640
in those 20 years I've given this talk in many, many places around the world in the United States

253
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:29,160
and more recently in India and in Stockholm. And so this transparency is written long, long before

254
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:36,440
Roger Penrose got the Nobel Prize, but I've always been an admirer of his twister program.

255
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:44,680
So incidentally, I mentioned my popular book Fearful Symmetry, and some of you know that I was

256
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:55,320
honored that Roger actually wrote the preface to my book, the forward to my book. So having that,

257
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:03,720
I guess a little bit of an ad, but having said this, let me now come back to quantum field theory.

258
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:11,800
So already in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the photon, namely the electromagnetic field,

259
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:19,320
is treated as a field, but not the electron. So the photon is a field, but not the electron. The

260
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:25,400
electron is treated as a particle. So that is the formalism in non-relativistic quantum mechanics.

261
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:31,400
Then you write down a Schroding equation for this electron, and then you couple in the photon field.

262
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,960
This is what people in the United States, I don't know what people would call it in England,

263
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:44,120
but people in the United States, or at least I call it a half-assed treatment. It's absolutely bizarre

264
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,040
to treat one particle as a field and not the other. So this motivated Jordan, Heisenberg,

265
00:33:52,040 --> 00:34:00,360
Dirac, and others to introduce the field. In particular, Dirac treated the electron as a field.

266
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:07,800
So henceforth, the electron has become a field. Now the next very important step was taken by

267
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:14,840
Fermi, and most people do not realize this, which is that Fermi said photons can be created,

268
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:22,360
so the electron can also be created. So that's what I emphasize in my introduction, birth and death,

269
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,680
because this in the weak interaction, the electrons come zooming out.

270
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,480
And the famous, the eminent authorities, the older people at that time, they all said the

271
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:39,880
electron was already inside a nucleus. It's obvious. And Heisenberg wrote that as a younger

272
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:46,920
physicist, he got angry letters from older people saying that Heisenberg, you're a crazy guy,

273
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:52,200
you know, we know that the electron is inside a nucleus. And how can you agree with Fermi

274
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:58,680
that the electron was created in the weakened action? Okay, so I'm writing about this in a book

275
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:06,040
I'm working on about how the younger generation got bashed by the older physicists. So here's the

276
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:15,240
lesson for the students at Cambridge University. Don't listen to those old guys. Okay, so after

277
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,560
that, all particles are excitations in some field. The electron is an excitation electron field.

278
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,200
The proton is an excitation in the proton field. We don't talk about protons anymore.

279
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:35,080
But we talk about quarks. So quarks are excitation in some quark field. So from in this point of

280
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:41,080
view, the graviton is just like a particle, like any other particle, it's just an excitation

281
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:48,520
in the gravitational field. And this is the philosophy pushed by Weinberg in his textbook on

282
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:57,000
gravity. And Weinberg is sort of anti the geometrical interpretation. But this is a very

283
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,560
minority view. Somehow, the gravitational field seems to be special, seems to be different from

284
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:11,640
all other fields. So somehow also responsible, the gravitational field is responsible for the

285
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:21,800
spacetime arena in which all particles work and play. So in my book, I use an analogy. This is

286
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:28,600
like an avant-garde theater, somehow there's no stage. But one of the actors is the stage.

287
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:34,760
The other actors are all climbing over him. So somehow the gravitational field is somehow

288
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:41,320
different. And I think this is the trouble that we face in trying to formulate quantum gravity.

289
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:48,040
And then we now have this, the biggest problem in theoretical physics now is to understand the

290
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:55,720
cosmological constant, why it's so small. So once we introduce gravity, we introduce a new

291
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:02,920
constant into nature, not just H bar and C, as I mentioned before, but also Newton's constant.

292
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:09,000
So the square of physics becomes a cube of physics. But I don't have time to go into this,

293
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,120
because this is not a talk about gravity. The talk about gravity I gave at the Royal

294
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:22,600
Institution a few months ago. Okay, so this is one of the puzzles in theoretical physics today,

295
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,480
which I hope some young people in the audience would be able to resolve.

296
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:38,040
So anyway, as Oscar mentioned, the first year I was an assistant professor at Princeton,

297
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:45,640
the very first course I ever taught in my life, that is, in my entire life, there was the first

298
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:52,520
time I was in charge of a course for students. I taught a course on quantum field theory.

299
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:01,000
And so people at that time, after the course, many people asked me to write up my notes as a book.

300
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:07,960
But other people, of course, gave me more practical advice, which is that you better not write a textbook

301
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:17,480
until you get tenure. So I waited for many years, for 30 years before I wrote my textbook, in 2003.

302
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:25,880
So here's the cover of the original edition of my quantum field theory book. And what it is,

303
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:32,440
what it is, is this painting shows the student, here's the student. The student is trying to reach

304
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:38,760
the field, the green field, quantum field theory. But in order to reach the field,

305
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:45,160
he or she has to hack through all of these weeds and so on and so forth. He has to learn a lot of

306
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:52,120
undergraduate level physics before he can reach the field. And once he gets past the field,

307
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,080
then he could start climbing the mountain. And we don't know what is on the other side of the

308
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:09,320
mountain. It may be string theory, it may be something else. So that's 2003. And seven years later,

309
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:16,920
came out with a revised edition and added a lot of new material. It turns out in those seven years

310
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:26,680
from 2003 to 2010, there were quite a few new developments that are important. So one of them

311
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:37,160
is in fact the flowering of Penrose's Twister program in application to quantum chromodynamics.

312
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,040
And my quantum field theory book has since been translated into other languages.

313
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,680
And the most amusing thing so recently was translating to Japanese.

314
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:58,280
The Japanese publisher told me that the Japanese have smaller hands and they cannot hold the

315
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,400
quantum field theory book. It's too thick. So my quantum field theory book got chopped into

316
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:11,240
two volumes. This is volume one, it just came out. So I just received a copy. But the translation

317
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:18,840
Russian is very amusing. You can see my name up here in quantum field theory in a nutshell.

318
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:26,920
But it turns out nutshell doesn't mean anything in Russian. I don't know why. Is it because they

319
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:34,440
don't have nuts in Siberia? I don't know. So the title was translated as quantum field theory in

320
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:40,520
two words. And so all my Russian friends are laughing that I've now published a book with

321
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,880
a logically inconsistent title. The title already has more than two words.

322
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,720
So now I want to also talk about a little bit more about the quantum field theory. One of the

323
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:02,600
most interesting things about quantum field theory in the last 30, 40 years is the rise

324
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:09,240
of field theory in condensed matter physics. So this is, I want to say this is distinct from

325
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,800
earlier use of perturbative field theory. So for example, when I was a student, there were two

326
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:23,800
textbooks Federer and Wallachka and Abrikosov and Al. They use Feynman diagrams just to keep track of

327
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:31,320
some perturbation theory calculation when they do perturbative calculations. So but the rise of

328
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:40,440
field theory in the last 30 years of the 20th century was quite spectacular. And it's not

329
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:48,360
merely using Feynman diagrams to do perturbative stuff. So I mentioned several examples that

330
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,320
in the quantum Hall fluid, the microscopic degrees of freedoms will cause the electrons.

331
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:58,200
But the long distance physics is controlled by as to turn Simon's gauge field

332
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:05,960
with fractionally charged excitations. Another example surface growth can be connected,

333
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,760
can be studied using the language of renomization group. And another is that disorder

334
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:19,800
can be studied by the replica method and supersymmetry. So here I also want to mention

335
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,760
another characteristic of my book. So this is one characteristic of my book because I think

336
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:30,040
this is important. So that if you ask me, how is my quantum field theory book different

337
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:36,600
from other quantum field theory book is because I include one third of the book is on condensed

338
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:42,600
matter physics, maybe one quarter. And the other thing is I introduce gravity as early as possible.

339
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:48,840
So when I was a graduate student, nobody mentions gravity unless you take course on

340
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,480
general relativity and gravity and so on. But nobody would mention gravity in a course on

341
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:59,480
quantum field theory. I never heard a single word about gravity in my courses on quantum field

342
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:06,200
theory. But now, of course, it's taken central center stage. So the other feature of my book

343
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:13,960
is I try to be much lighter in tone in the formalism. So I introduce a lot of stories,

344
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:20,360
jokes, fictitious characters a la Galileo. I introduce a character named Confusio and Confusio

345
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:26,760
is always wandering around my book. And now I get emails from students saying Confusio is their

346
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:35,800
famous character. And I even have a that even recently, a professor Berkeley said on the internet

347
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:43,400
that he is Confusio that he's confused about a lot of things. The other thing about my book

348
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:53,640
on quantum field theory is divided into eight parts. And this is also a joke. I was referring

349
00:43:53,640 --> 00:44:00,280
to something in Chinese literature. I was referring to the eight parts of the celestial dragon.

350
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:07,880
And for those Chinese students in the audience who knows who Jin Yong is, you can look up this link.

351
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:19,560
So now I want to tell you that quantum field theory has had two near death experiences.

352
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:30,360
Quantum field theory actually almost died twice. Okay. So in the late 1940s, there was its first

353
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:36,600
death. Because it was unable to produce Lorentz covariant results and divergences.

354
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,480
And it was not able to handle the strong intention. The strong intention that time

355
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:48,440
was the theory of Yukawa's. And because of the coupling is very strong, the Feynman diagrams

356
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:55,400
and other perturbative approaches are completely useful and were completely useless.

357
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:01,400
And so people like Landau go as far as to say that quantum field theory should be buried.

358
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:08,520
I'm quoting Landau, this quote in my new book on quantum field theory.

359
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:18,840
And interestingly, it's people like Landau and I think also Newsboro, Heisenberg,

360
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:25,560
all those people saying quantum field theory was dead. Interestingly, it was the young people

361
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:33,080
who came out of the in the late 1940s. They were the conserved. The older people were the

362
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:38,440
revolutionary. So sometimes we call them the revolutionary conservatives. And you know whom

363
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:44,600
I'm talking about. I'm talking about people like Feynman and Schwinger and Tomonaga.

364
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:52,520
And the next second time that quantum field theory almost died is in the late 1960s when the S

365
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:59,480
Matrix School came into being. And this was the ability to deal with the strong intention.

366
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:08,440
And so I had to make a very difficult choice between going to when I was going to graduate school.

367
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:14,760
I had to make a difficult choice between going to Harvard or going to Berkeley. And if I'd gone

368
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,400
to Berkeley, that would be the end of me. Because at that time Berkeley was the center of the S

369
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:29,880
Matrix School. And in which quantum field theory is looked on as some old ancient thing that nobody

370
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:37,320
cares about anymore. But no, in the 1970s, as you all know, thanks to the work of the young genius

371
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:45,880
Behoeft from Holland, quantum field theory triumphed. And as my professor,

372
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:53,240
Sidney Coleman later wrote, the triumph of field theory in the 1970s was a victory parade

373
00:46:54,120 --> 00:47:01,880
that made the spectators gasp with joy. I'm sorry, I can't even read, gasp with awe and laugh with joy.

374
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,600
So I'm here also, I also wanted to tell you something for you to think about.

375
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,400
I'm not going to explain that here, quantum mechanics is like a zero plus one dimensional

376
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:19,320
field theory. And string theory is like a one plus one dimensional field theory. Okay, now let me go

377
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:31,080
backwards and talk about quantum mechanics. Now when we teach quantum mechanics or when we learn

378
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:38,280
quantum mechanics, depending on whether you are a professor or a student, usually we talk about the

379
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:46,280
Schrodinger or Heisenberg formalism. Schrodinger has wave functions and Heisenberg has operators.

380
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:54,760
But there's a conceptually more profound formalism due to Dirac and Feynman. It's called the Dirac-Feynman

381
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:00,920
path integral formalism, or the Schrodinger functional integral formalism. And of course,

382
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:07,640
Schrodinger and Feynman's formalism are equivalent. And this leads naturally to quantum field theory.

383
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:14,040
So let's ask about the origin of the path integral. Let me explain the origin

384
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:22,040
of path integral formalism. So in quantum mechanics, immediately in chapter one,

385
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:28,440
we learn about the two slit experiment. So electrons are emitted from a source.

386
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:37,000
And there's a screen where detector is placed, oh, this detector. And between the

387
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:44,360
screen and the source, there's another screen, which has two slits in it. And so the electron

388
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:50,680
could either go through this slit and or to go through that slit. And then there's an amplitude

389
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:57,080
probability amplitude for going through one slit and the probability for going through another slit.

390
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:02,280
And then you're supposed to add the probability amplitude. And you see the quantum interference

391
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:08,840
phenomenon and so on and so forth. Now here's an interesting comment. Students almost never ask,

392
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:15,560
what is three holes? I have also taught quantum mechanics. And I've never met a student who asked,

393
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:22,200
what if you had three holes in the screen? Okay. So in my quantum field theory book,

394
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,880
I imagine a student named Feynman asking this question. By the way, there's so many Feynman

395
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:34,360
stories circulating on the web. And I feel, why not if people can make up Feynman stories,

396
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:42,840
I can make one up too. So I imagine a student named Feynman asking, what if you have three holes?

397
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,520
Okay. So the professor then explained, okay, well, you just add the amplitude. So going through

398
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:56,040
these three holes. And then Feynman asked, what if you add another screen? And also with a bunch

399
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:04,440
of holes in it. And the professor is starting to get impatient and losing his patience. And the

400
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:11,800
professor said, come on, don't waste my time. You just add all the amplitudes. There's an

401
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:16,600
probability amplitude for going through this hole. And then this hole, and then this hole,

402
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:25,640
and you just add them all up. Okay. So, but this student persists. And he asked the most

403
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:34,680
zen question of all, what if you add infinite number of screens and drill infinite number

404
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:46,440
of holes in each screen? Okay. So then there is no screen. If you have infinite number of screens

405
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:52,360
with infinite number of holes. And so you have to add amplitudes over all paths. So it's like a

406
00:50:52,360 --> 00:51:00,760
young person. Reach the end of your life. Now all possibilities are open up to you. Okay.

407
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:09,080
So we now have to add up not all the amplitudes through each hole, as the professor was saying,

408
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:19,480
but you now have to integrate over all paths. Okay. So this very zen question, having an infinite

409
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:28,360
number of screens with an infinite number of holes in it, is the origin of the path integral

410
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:39,000
formalism invented by Dirac and Feynman. Okay. So quantum field theory, there amongst an integral.

411
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,320
So I'm saying, I was just saying here, oops, normal in quantum mechanics, which we talked about

412
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:51,960
adding the summing over the paths. But if you have infinite number of paths, you integrate over

413
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:58,200
all possible paths. So when all is said and done, you introduce formalism and so on.

414
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:06,200
Quantum field theory, just one great big fancy sum or integral. So as you can see, sometimes

415
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:12,360
if I give this popular talk to a general audience, it depends on what the audience is. I may even

416
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:17,320
have to explain, the audience may not even know what an integral is, and I have to tell them it's

417
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:23,880
a big fancy sum. And the integral is, but this audience of course knows what an integral is.

418
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:30,680
It's an integral over d phi, e to the minus s phi, some function, some function of phi.

419
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:38,360
And phi is the field, a generic notation for the field. It depends on space and time.

420
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:44,440
And the space can be d dimensional. Then you can, you have written the quantum field theory

421
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:50,680
in d plus one dimensional space time. Now, how do we get the quantum mechanics? Quantum mechanics

422
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:59,560
is when you restrict this field to be just a function of time, but not of space. And then

423
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:07,880
this field has another name, just to confuse the undergraduates. In undergraduate courses,

424
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:15,560
it's called position or coordinate of the particle, position of the particle. And so that you recognize

425
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:21,320
is quantum mechanics. If phi represents the position of particles, that is the path integral

426
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:27,480
formalism of, this is the path integral formalism of quantum mechanics. So quantum mechanics can be

427
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:34,360
thought of as zero plus one dimensional field theory. Now, I have also worked on random matrix

428
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:41,320
theory. And random matrix theory is to say phi is not even a function of time, but it's a matrix.

429
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:47,960
Then it's just an integral over all possible matrices. So random matrix theory could be imagined,

430
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:54,280
could be thought of as a zero plus zero dimensional space time. And one of the things I did

431
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:02,520
in quantum field theory, sorry, in random matrix theory was to develop with the French

432
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:11,640
physicist Edouard Brezon how to treat this using Feynman integrals. So we introduce Feynman diagrams

433
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:20,360
into random matrix theory. And finally, students can see if I go down, I can go down to ordinary

434
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:26,760
integral calculus in which the matrix is just replaced by a number by real number. Then that's

435
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:33,080
as an ordinary integral in calculus. So you see quantum field theory, if you like, is a generalization

436
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:41,880
of the integral in calculus. So 80 years of quantum field theory, a big part of it is,

437
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:48,760
consists of finding methods or tricks to do the functional integral. So one example is that people

438
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:55,080
then put this integral, discretize it, sort of going backwards from Newton, going backwards

439
00:54:55,080 --> 00:55:01,480
from Newton and lightness, replace the integral by a sum, and then use computer to crank away.

440
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,800
So that's one area of physics you could go into, which is called lattice gauge theory.

441
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:16,680
Now, so we have an integral to do, which we don't know how to do. So as I said, the

442
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:23,880
path integral in quantum field theory, you can think of the simplest version of it just an

443
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:29,400
ordinary integral. So let me give you an ordinary integral you don't know how that you cannot do.

444
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:35,320
We all know that without this term, without this 5-4 term, we can all do this integral.

445
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:41,320
So if I cover up the 5-4 term, this is just a Gaussian integral that many of you know how to do.

446
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:49,800
But how do you do this? This integral is not known. Now there's a fabulous idea, which is

447
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:59,880
one way of doing this integral is to expand it in G. So we just expand this in a Taylor series.

448
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:05,720
And then these are all Gauss versions of the Gaussian integral. I told you this integral,

449
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,200
e to the minus m square phi square is doable and also doable with 5-4n.

450
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:18,280
Now I can do this integral and sum it all back up. But then there are many, many terms,

451
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:28,360
infinite number of terms. And the fabulous idea is to just draw little diagrams to keep track of

452
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:37,080
all these terms. So I still remember when I was an undergraduate, I was really eager to learn about

453
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:44,440
Feynman diagrams, which I had heard so much about. And then later I realized Feynman diagrams is just

454
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:53,240
based on this idea of expanding the path integral and then integrating term by term

455
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:59,160
and then draw diagrams to keep track of the terms. But it was a fabulous idea and nobody

456
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:10,120
else had this idea. It was amazing. So in my quantum field theory book, I talk about some

457
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:16,360
different versions of quantum field theory or Feynman diagrams. I could do a baby version and

458
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:26,120
a baby version is exactly this. So talking about Feynman, I want to show you guys,

459
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:32,120
so show you students because it's also a hope to inspire the students in the audience.

460
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,280
I want to show you Feynman's last blackboard in case you haven't seen it.

461
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:46,760
And he sets impossible standards for himself on the two upper left boxes. One of them is

462
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:53,960
what I cannot create. I do not understand. And this is an impossible demand, obviously.

463
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:59,160
Know how to solve every problem that has ever been solved. But anyway, some of you might take

464
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:07,240
this as your slogan. But also note he has a box called to learn. I don't know if you can see,

465
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:12,440
it's not very clear, but you can make out this stage to learn. The second box on the right.

466
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:18,360
And the interesting thing about all the things he wanted to learn, he crossed out one of them.

467
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:27,960
Okay, I have learned it. So that's it. Okay. So that's very admirable. Now I also want to mention

468
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:38,280
that after Feynman died, I visited Caltech. And just for one day, and they let me sit in

469
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:43,960
Feynman's office. So I just thought, oh, I would look at his blackboard. But unfortunately,

470
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:49,160
somebody had erased everything already. It's just a blank blackboard. And I sat there in this empty

471
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:56,760
office. And I thought, well, maybe I could get some secret vibes and get some good ideas. But

472
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:06,760
unfortunately for me, nothing happened. So now come from Feynman, we get to Schringer. So Schringer,

473
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:13,720
in 1948, Schringer calculated the first term of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron,

474
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:20,920
beating Feynman. So Schringer is so proud of this, that he was managed to beat Feynman. Feynman was

475
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:26,120
not able to calculate it. By the way, a lot of people don't know this. And they just thought

476
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:32,440
Feynman did, Feynman did, Feynman did, Feynman did. But Schringer actually beat Feynman. And so the

477
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:39,880
expression for the magnetic moment of the electron is actually carved on Schringer's tombstone. So

478
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:45,720
if you ever visit the other Cambridge, that is to say Cambridge, Massachusetts, you should

479
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:54,280
go check up, you should go look at this tombstone and pay your respect to Julian Schringer.

480
00:59:55,240 --> 01:00:01,720
So Dirac, of course, had given any moment of the electron, but we are talking about

481
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:08,680
deviation from Dirac's value. So Dirac's calculation was not based, did not use quantum

482
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:19,080
field theory. Of course, Dirac was inventing quantum field theory. So I show you the current value for

483
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:24,840
the anomalous magnetic moment. The muon in some suitable unit is given by this, and you can see

484
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:32,040
it's measured to 10 to the minus 11. And people have now calculated all these digits, but Schringer

485
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:40,920
got the 116. Now to put this accuracy, that's what I said in the beginning of this lecture,

486
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:51,080
that quantum field theory is the most accurately tested theory in physics. Newtonian mechanics

487
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:57,800
is not tested to the 10 to the minus 11 level. So to put this accuracy in rough pictorial perspective,

488
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:10,040
consider the distance between Cambridge and Oxford via A41, 421. That distance is 83 miles.

489
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:17,800
Then the present uncertainty of 10 to the minus 11, it corresponds roughly to the minus 3 millimeter.

490
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:25,640
And for this to make any sense, I looked up the width of a human hair. So it turns out human hair

491
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:31,480
varies whether you have fine hair or coarse hair, different races of different thickness.

492
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:40,040
So this is maybe something like one tenth the width of a human hair. So just imagine that

493
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:50,600
this is from Cambridge and Oxford. By the way, I told you to visit the other Cambridge.

494
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:58,280
If you have a chance, you should also visit the other Oxford. My son is actually a professor

495
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:06,920
of biology at the other Oxford in the United States. Okay, so here I show you Schringer's Triumph

496
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,240
in which you beat Feynman. And this is taken from my quantum field theory book.

497
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:19,000
So here's a Feynman diagram in which the photon comes in and it interacts with the electron.

498
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:25,800
And so this is what the rack calculated. And what Schringer calculated is this one.

499
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:33,000
So in the process, the electron emits a photon, which is then absorbed by the outgoing electron.

500
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,920
And Feynman was not able to calculate this, but Schringer did.

501
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:50,920
So as I said, I took quantum field theory courses from Schringer. He was the king

502
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:57,560
at Harvard physics department at the time. And Schringer was not very pleased.

503
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:02,840
And one of his famous saying is that Feynman brought quantum field theory to the masses.

504
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:09,320
So and I think Schringer is more or less right that nowadays you just learn the Feynman rules.

505
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:15,960
You draw a few diagrams, you stick in, then you follow the Feynman rules and you just

506
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:21,720
calculate away. If you can't do the integral, you stick it on a computer. And so in fact,

507
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:27,880
one of my colleagues in Israel, a professor in Israel, he used to refer some to some of his

508
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:34,200
colleagues in physics as professors of Feynman diagrams. That was at derogatory terms. People

509
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:38,760
don't understand physics, but can calculate Feynman diagrams. So that's what Schringer said.

510
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:46,120
So now naturally, at Harvard, at that time, and this is Paul Martin, so I'll tell you who Paul

511
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:52,440
Martin is. He's a very famous condensed matter physicist who passed away a few years ago.

512
01:03:53,080 --> 01:04:00,360
He was one of Schringer's prize students. And he was in generation. He's probably 20 years

513
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:05,560
older than I am. When I was a student, I took Paul Martin's course. Also,

514
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:14,520
and Paul Martin was a Schringer's student. And so he was describing the situation a generation

515
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:22,280
ahead of me. And he said, in the dark recesses of the subbasement of Lyman, Lyman is the name

516
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:28,600
of the building that the Harvard physics department was located in. So where theoretical

517
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:33,880
students retired to decipher the tablets, and of course, tablets doesn't mean tablet computer

518
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:42,280
at those days. It just means a notebook and where the ritual taboo on pagan pictures could

519
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:50,840
be safely ignored. So this is still true when I was a student, maybe 15, 20 years later.

520
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:59,080
Some of my friends were students of Schringer's. And Schringer would assign them some calculation

521
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:05,240
to do. Now, as I said, of course, Schringer can do it in his own formalism.

522
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:12,600
But it is much, much easier to do calculations, Feynman diagrams. That's why Feynman diagrams

523
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:21,000
are so popular. So some of these students told me they would hide somewhere and do the calculation

524
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,840
using Feynman diagrams. And then after they get the result, they would try to translate it back

525
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:32,680
into Schringer's formalism. And of course, they show Schringer the result without showing how they

526
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:43,320
got it. So here's another picture, the rivalry between the two grades. And you see this was

527
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:49,880
at the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm in 1965. And interestingly, this must be right after the

528
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:56,120
ceremony, because you can see Schringer still holding, he has taken off one of his white gloves,

529
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:01,720
but he still have the other white gloves on. And here's Feynman. And this picture, I'm going to

530
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:11,160
include this picture in the book I'm working on right now, because it really shows the very

531
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:18,040
different personality. Feynman is, you can see talking away and who knows what BS is spouting.

532
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:25,000
And Schringer is very, very typical. He doesn't sit, even sit straight. He sort of always sits at

533
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:30,840
an angle. And in this picture, maybe to sort of get away from Feynman as far as he could.

534
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:38,280
Anyhow, I'm just speculating, of course, I have the greatest admiration for both of these guys.

535
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:48,120
Those are these guys are tremendous. I really like Feynman. And one reason I really like Feynman

536
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:54,440
was because once at some conference, he invited me to go with him to some nightclub. Now I cannot

537
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:59,400
even imagine Schringer doing such. I can't even imagine Schringer ever going to a nightclub,

538
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:09,880
but Feynman is like the opposite. And by the way, I recommend you guys to read an essay by

539
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:16,680
Deser. And also through Google, you can find a Deser or Schringer student. And he wrote an essay

540
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:23,720
about a tale of two voices, about the contrast between Feynman and Schringer. And it's fascinating

541
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:33,880
because Deser is now, Deser is 15 years older than I am. And so he belongs to the older generation,

542
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:42,040
and he knew both of them quite well. So he was really able to compare these two people to amazing

543
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:50,280
geniuses. So I want to now talk about some of the landmarks in quantum field theory. And

544
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:57,320
Heisenberg introduced us to internal space by inventing isospin. And Hermann Weill

545
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:05,640
introduced gauge symmetry. And then Yang-Mills and others generalized the gauge symmetry of

546
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:13,160
vial to non-ambient gauge symmetry. So these are landmarks. And as I said, Landau and the

547
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:18,200
earlier generation thought that quantum field theory is dead. But in the 70s, people like

548
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:25,400
Weinberg and Glasshauer and so on resurrected things through the work of Tohoft, who resurrected

549
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:31,320
quantum field theory. And now we know that all three interactions are described by Yang-Mills theory.

550
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:39,960
So undergraduates are justifiably fascinated by Yang-Mills theory, the weakened action and all

551
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:49,960
these things. And in my most recent book published by Princeton, and which come out in October 2020,

552
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:56,840
that is right now. It's called Fly by Night Physics. I give a very simple introduction for

553
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:04,280
undergraduates in part nine of this book. And I know that undergraduates could understand some of

554
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:09,000
this because I have tried it out on the undergraduates here in Santa Barbara.

555
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:17,240
So I talk a little bit about quantum field theory. So great triumph. Feynman diagrams

556
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:25,000
revolutionized quantum field theory. And for many years, the influence of Feynman diagrams was

557
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:32,120
enormous. So even when I was in graduate school, I was told by one professor that quantum field

558
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:38,760
theory is equal to the sum of Feynman diagrams. Okay, we now know that this view is wrong.

559
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:45,400
That Feynman diagram just perturbative. So one of the important things that happened in the

560
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:53,400
mid 1970s, a new generation of young people came on the scene. I already mentioned Tohoft,

561
01:09:54,360 --> 01:10:02,200
and also Polikoff. I've described it in my book as breaking the shackles of Feynman diagrams.

562
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:09,080
They discover all kinds of non-perturbative structure, such as magnetic monopoles, that cannot

563
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:16,200
be seen by Feynman diagrams. So these go like e to the minus one over g square in the answer. So

564
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:21,160
imagine that integral that I showed you earlier. Suppose the answer has a term that depends on

565
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:27,560
this. Them expanding in powers of g as a Taylor series wouldn't make any sense if you never see

566
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:34,280
this. And all kinds of things appeared in quantum field theory, duality, topology, all kinds of

567
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:40,440
things. And for example, when I talk about the application of quantum Hall effect that has to

568
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:49,800
do with duality and topology. And all that you cannot see in Feynman diagrams by Feynman diagrams.

569
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:58,200
So I see it's now my time is already 11 o'clock. So some of you may be getting

570
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:05,720
a little bit anxious. So I am coming to the end of my talk. I'm going to wrap up. I'm going to wrap

571
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:13,080
up by asking a question, which is what is the purpose of studying physics? I like to ask the

572
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:21,400
students in my class this question. And no, to make money is not the correct answer. Well,

573
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:27,640
it may work. It is the correct answer for some people. And I do have one student who worked with

574
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:36,760
me and gotten a PhD on a random matrix theory, who is now a big shot on Wall Street. But to me,

575
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:44,440
the purpose of studying physics is to understand nature and not just to calculate

576
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:51,080
and to fit to some experiment, but to understand nature at a deep level and at a deeper and deeper

577
01:11:51,080 --> 01:12:00,920
level. Okay, so quantum field theory, tell us to understand, help us to understand nature at a

578
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:07,560
deeper level than quantum mechanics. So now I want to talk about intellectual completeness of

579
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:15,320
different areas of physics. And what do I mean by intellectual completeness? Let me give you an

580
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:23,000
example. So for example, the Pauli exclusion principle and the spin statistics connection

581
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:30,360
that which says that particles to integer spin, integers spin at bosons, and we have

582
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:41,560
spins of fermions. And duck and Sudarshan, by the way, I shouldn't pronounce this word as duck,

583
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:48,120
but since I'm a Chinese American, I could be excused. He would be very upset if he heard

584
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:53,960
pronounced it like that, because he's German. And of course, there's an umlaut about the you.

585
01:12:54,600 --> 01:13:02,040
And it's actually Duke. Duke and Sudarshan wrote a very interesting book, which I recommend to

586
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:08,440
students. So again, I've been ranting and raving about how American students don't know anything

587
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:15,880
about history. It's about the history of the Pauli exclusion principle. And this is especially,

588
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:23,400
I think, of interest to young British physicists, because the first person to propose the exclusion

589
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:31,080
principle was actually a young Englishman named Stoner. And what Duncan Sudarshan said was that

590
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:37,240
there's not one fact in the physical world, which has a greater impact on the way things are. Now,

591
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:41,960
this is a very strong claim about one fact in the physical world, which has a greater impact.

592
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:48,760
And in some sense, they're right, from atoms to neutron stars to lasers, and much of condensed

593
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:54,920
matter physics, for example, band structure, superconductivity, et cetera, et cetera. All of this

594
01:13:54,920 --> 01:14:00,920
depends on the Pauli exclusion principle, right? But this is just a rule in non relativistic quantum

595
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:06,600
mechanics. What I always tell students when they're taking a course on non relativistic quantum

596
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:13,800
mechanics is to ask the professor, where does this rule come from? And the professors wouldn't

597
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:18,440
know the answer if it sticks to non relativistic quantum mechanics, because in non relativistic

598
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:24,040
quantum mechanics, it's just an empirical rule. It just fell down from heaven. Okay.

599
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:31,240
But quantum field theory can derive the Pauli exclusion principle, Pauli exclusion principle

600
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:37,960
and the spin statistics theorem can be derived. So this is what I mean by intellectual completeness.

601
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:44,360
Quantum field theory is more complete than quantum mechanics. There are things that in

602
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:51,240
quantum mechanics have to be treated as an arbitrary rule, but which can be derived in quantum field theory.

603
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:57,640
So how do you know all the electrons in the world are identical?

604
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:03,720
They could have been made in a factory somewhere, and there's manufacturing defects.

605
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:08,360
One electron is slightly different from the others. How do you know? And we need quantum

606
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:15,720
field theory to explain this. And the explanation is so elegantly simple that it has to be right.

607
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:20,280
But all the electrons are identical because as Dirac and others told us,

608
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:27,320
this is excitations in the quantum, in the electron field, the excitations in the same field.

609
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:33,960
So, but again, in non relativistic quantum mechanics, who knows, this was a God given

610
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:41,480
rule or something. Okay. Why is the electron charge exactly equal in magnitude to the proton

611
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:48,280
charge? This is one of the most important facts of the universe. If not the electrostatic repulsion

612
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:52,680
between different parts of the universe would blow the universe apart.

613
01:15:54,440 --> 01:16:00,600
But quantum electrodynamics in this sense is less complete than grand unified field theory.

614
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:07,880
In grand unified field theory, this comes out. Okay. It's a consequence of a requirement in

615
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:15,880
quantum field theory that the fields belong to the same representation of the symmetry group.

616
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:22,120
But in quantum electrodynamics, the string confinement, there was no explanation.

617
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,120
When I was taking the course

618
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:34,440
from Schringer, I could have raised my hand and asked Schringer, why is the electron charge

619
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:40,360
equal, exactly equal in magnitude to the proton charge? Schringer would not have been able to

620
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:48,680
answer. Now, I mentioned this as a joke, because you know what would happen in Schringer's courses

621
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:54,440
if you raise your hand to ask a question. You were told beforehand by the other older students,

622
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:59,480
they're not supposed to raise your hand and ask questions. Schringer just would ignore

623
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:06,360
that. It is sort of a little bit like Dirac when Dirac was lecturing. You may run the risk of being

624
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:14,840
kicked out of the room if you have to ask a question. Okay. Now, let me ask, why is space

625
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:21,160
times three plus one dimensional? You know, always wonder about that when you started studying physics.

626
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:28,120
A quantum field theory is in this sense less intellectually complete than string theory.

627
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:34,520
String theory actually specializes the space time dimension. Now, quantum field theory,

628
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:40,840
of course, can be written in any space time dimension. It could be written in any,

629
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:48,760
nothing in quantum field theory fixes the dimension of space. Now, string theory, of course,

630
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:56,200
is much more restrictive. And as you all know, probably, that it could only be written in nine

631
01:17:56,200 --> 01:18:04,360
plus one dimensional space time. So this is also a joke. String theory predicts that space

632
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:11,480
time has to be nine plus one dimension. And they have to scramble to compactify six of these

633
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:19,480
unseen dimensions. Okay, I'm going to wrap up. This is one of the last things I mentioned,

634
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:26,040
because I want some, perhaps some young people can solve this. To me, one of the greatest mysteries

635
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:31,720
in physics is that the dynamical evolution of quantum world is given by an exponential of the

636
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:38,360
Hamiltonian. And the Boltzmann factor in statistical physics also given by the exponential

637
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:46,600
of the Hamiltonian. So there's a connection between imaginary time and inverse temperature.

638
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:54,840
Is this just a coincidence or deeper? Over the years, I've asked a number of very famous

639
01:18:54,840 --> 01:19:01,000
distinguished physicists this, and people seem to think that two different opinions, some people

640
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:06,840
think it's just a coincidence, and some people think it may have a deeper significance. I don't

641
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:15,160
know the answer. And I thought about it also. But be that as in May, it has some very useful

642
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:22,520
consequences. One very useful consequence is that it could be applied to calculating the

643
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:28,680
Hawking temperature of a black hole, basically almost in two lines. This is shown in my book.

644
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:34,920
But of course, I didn't invent that. I think that was invented by Gibbons and Hawking.

645
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:44,840
And you just analytically continue to this imaginary time, and you get the temperature.

646
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:51,400
I mentioned that this has some very useful consequences. I just mentioned one. I mentioned

647
01:19:51,400 --> 01:20:01,320
another consequence, which is that for a long time, we had these fundraising events

648
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:06,120
in Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara is full of rich people, and you may have heard.

649
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:15,400
And so we're trying to get some of those rich people to give money. And the attitude is, of

650
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:20,360
course, I'm rich, so why should I give money to a bunch of theoretical physicists?

651
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:27,960
So I tell them, well, I'll tell you some very interesting, fascinating thing, that temperature,

652
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:38,200
you know, just imaginary time. And this always blows them away. So anyway, another useful consequence

653
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:43,720
is that partition function in statistical physics and in mind, many body physics could be represented

654
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:49,000
as Euclidean field theory in contrast to Minkowski field theory, because we have to continue,

655
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:54,920
right? It's imaginary time, so we continue instead of the Minkowski metric, we continue

656
01:20:54,920 --> 01:21:01,320
to Euclidean metrics. And many other problems in physics can then be represented as quantum field

657
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:06,120
theory. So this just to show you that quantum field theory is very useful in many areas of physics.

658
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:16,680
So finally, I conclude by saying something that everybody in physics knows, everybody in theoretical

659
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:24,680
physics, there have been two great attempts at two great marriages. And the great marriage of

660
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:31,080
the 20th century was that quantum physics was married to special relativity. And as I emphasized

661
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:37,480
in the first transparency, this led to this very rich and marvelous subject called quantum field

662
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:45,880
theory, not Einstein, two daughters. One is called special relativity, the other is called general

663
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:52,040
relativity. And in the late 20th century, and now continuing into the early 21st century,

664
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:59,560
people are trying to marry quantum physics to general relativity. And we don't know what it

665
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:05,880
will reproduce, what it will produce. It would perhaps some people say string theory, but it

666
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:11,640
could be something else. It would be exciting if it's something that nobody has thought of

667
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:17,400
and waiting for, just waiting for a young person in the audience to discover.

668
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:25,240
So with that, I end my talk and thank you very much for inviting me to give the Maxwell lecture

669
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:33,320
at Cambridge University. Thank you. And thank you so much for coming here. There was a very

670
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:45,720
interesting talk and we have had so many questions. So let's see. So I guess it's a bit hard to hear

671
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:54,040
the applause, but I'm sure the chat will give it anyway. So the first question that we have

672
01:22:54,040 --> 01:23:00,200
from the audience regards, you mentioned in the start of your talk regarding gravitons.

673
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:07,560
And they're asking, how likely do you think it is that gravitons actually exist?

674
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:16,680
Are there any experimental evidence for them? That's an extremely good question. Thank you.

675
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:25,720
Well, if we treat the gravitational field like any other field, as some people advocate,

676
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:32,920
then Einstein's theory is some action governing the behavior of this field, g mu nu,

677
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:42,280
and we expand g mu nu. Then it has a propagator as an interaction. It acts completely like a particle.

678
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:53,080
So I think from this point of view, many of us believe in graviton. Now, an opposite point of view

679
01:23:54,040 --> 01:24:02,760
is propagated by Dyson, which I mentioned in my book on gravity, and which I'll mention in this

680
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:09,800
book I'm working on also. Dyson said, if you're going to ever measure the effect of a graviton,

681
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:19,240
so for example, in the analog of the photoelectric effect to see a graviton kicking out an electron

682
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:26,200
from a piece of metal, you can easily sit down and do the estimate. It'll be longer than the age

683
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:35,640
of the universe. And so it's clearly experimentally impossible to actually see a graviton. And so

684
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:41,240
Dyson said, I don't care about gravitons, and we should not talk about gravitons,

685
01:24:41,240 --> 01:24:46,200
and we should not even quantize gravity. I mentioned that there was also a possibility

686
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:52,680
that some people do not want to quantize gravity. I'm not sure. So what I said in my book is that

687
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:59,720
I took the easy way out. I said on the weekends, I tend to believe Dyson, but the other days of the

688
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:08,600
week, I don't believe him. So I was very honored and privileged also to have seen Dyson in Princeton

689
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:15,960
a couple years before he passed away. And he is one of my favorite persons to talk to.

690
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:23,480
And I like the fact that he's very anti-establishment. So maybe gravitons don't exist, but we don't know.

691
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:32,200
We really don't know. I hope that answers your question. I think it's actually a mistake. I don't

692
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:37,720
agree with this fact that if you don't see it experimentally, there's no hope of experimentally

693
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:43,400
ever seeing it. Then it's not a useful thing to think about. In the 19th century, you know,

694
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:47,640
you can say the same thing. I mean, I think that was basically what people like Mark

695
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,600
were saying, that you cannot see atoms. So maybe you shouldn't talk about atoms.

696
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:57,160
You cannot see electrons. I don't like that philosophy.

697
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:05,560
To follow up a bit on then, what is, so where is it then that the problems come in with

698
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:11,080
quantum gravity? If we have this field of gravitons and we can describe it with the same

699
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:19,160
methods as we can, the electric field or the photon field, where do the problems arise?

700
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:25,400
Yes, yes, yes. Another very good question. Is this asked by the same person?

701
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:28,440
This is by me. This is just a short follow-up.

702
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:34,440
Yes, yes, that's also a very good question. So if you formulate,

703
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:42,840
you know, you quantize the gravitational field just by the usual method, and you have Feynman

704
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:53,240
diagrams. Okay, so you consider scattering two gravitons one on one with center mass energy

705
01:26:53,320 --> 01:27:00,840
capital E. Then you soon see the next order correction get larger and larger as the energy

706
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:05,800
goes up. But the energy has to go all the way up to the Planck energy for this to happen.

707
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:15,240
So the perturbation series sort of doesn't make sense. So, but again, Professor Dyson,

708
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:23,800
you know, I was tempted to say Freeman, but somehow I'm really inhibited from saying that.

709
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:35,800
Professor Dyson would not like that at all. So that you shouldn't even, therefore,

710
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:40,120
Professor Dyson would say, well, you shouldn't even be scattering gravitons and gravitons in the

711
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:47,400
first place. But that's one way of seeing it. And you can certainly see that if you just quantize

712
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:52,680
the graviton in the usual way, you get into a lot of troubles. But what Dyson is saying,

713
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:57,960
that he says the quantum physics, quantum mechanics should not apply to the gravity.

714
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:04,280
But I find that view is probably inconsistent in my book. I talk about that also. You cannot say

715
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:12,280
that half of the world is quantum and the other half is not quantum. So I don't know. I really

716
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:20,360
don't know. Okay, it's one of the open questions, I guess, of physics. Then we have another question

717
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:28,520
which relates to, is there a possibility that there may exist fields we don't know about yet?

718
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:34,120
Is there a possibility that there are fields that we don't know anything about yet?

719
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:34,920
Yeah.

720
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:41,960
Of course. Dark energy may be represented by a field that we don't know anything about.

721
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:47,880
Although if you ask me to bet, I would bet the dark energy is just the cosmological constant.

722
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:54,200
We don't know what the dark matter is, but quite likely that matter is just

723
01:28:55,160 --> 01:29:01,880
a particle described by a field. I published a paper on that a long time ago.

724
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:11,560
So I think that matter is just a scalar particle, a scalar field. It could be. We don't know. So

725
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:19,160
suddenly there may be fields we don't know anything about. So the experimentalists have to

726
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:20,360
sharpen the experiment.

727
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:31,240
Yeah. Okay. Then we have another question about expanding on quantum field theory,

728
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:40,040
in particular regarding loop quantum gravity. They're asking if loop quantum gravity is more

729
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,320
complete than QFT?

730
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:52,040
I'm not sufficiently of an expert on loop quantum gravity, so I don't want to say anything. I think

731
01:29:52,040 --> 01:30:00,040
you should invite somebody from loop quantum gravity, like Ashtakar or somebody like that,

732
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:06,760
somebody reputable in loop quantum gravity. I think not everyone in loop quantum gravity is

733
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:13,080
reputable. According to some measure, of course, a subjective measure. But maybe somebody like

734
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:22,680
Ashtakar can answer that question. Okay. Thank you very much. Then we have one question regarding.

735
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:30,200
Quickly add to that. And this again, I'm not an expert on loop quantum gravity. This is only by

736
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:42,600
hearsay from my string theory friends. You know, one of the things quantum field theory is able

737
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:51,080
to calculate what the Hawking temperature is using field theory methods. But it cannot

738
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:59,240
understand, it cannot tell us where those hidden degrees of freedom come from. And I understand

739
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:08,040
that string theory could explain, could identify those degrees of freedom. This is the famous

740
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:14,040
calculation of Alfa and Strowman. But I heard from my string theory friends that the loop

741
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:22,840
gravity people cannot even reproduce that result. So I don't know. I just remember that. Okay. Thanks.

742
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:33,640
Okay. Thank you very much. Then we have a question about the the Yang-Noil mass gap.

743
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:43,160
We have if we have a question asking, what would solving it mean for physics? The millennium

744
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:50,920
always question. That is has to do with confinement. And so that's a detail of the strong

745
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:57,160
attraction. Now Gell-Mann proposed quarks. And quarks are never seen in the experimental

746
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:05,160
search board in the 1960s and so on so forth. So Gell-Mann proposed that quarks were permanently

747
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:14,760
confined. But that seems very plausible. But has never been proven. So that's one of the millennium

748
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:21,960
price problems which I encourage young people to work on is to prove confinement. And a simpler

749
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:29,000
version of confinement is just to prove that there's a mass gap in QED and QCD in quantum

750
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:39,880
chromodynamics. Okay. Then then thank you very much for that. Then we have another question

751
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:53,480
regarding regarding what's it called. If there is so you mentioned in the early section of your talk

752
01:32:53,480 --> 01:33:02,280
regarding how spin can be used to predict whether a force is attractive or repulsive

753
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:11,720
between identical particles. And they're asking if there is a reason why spin zero attractions

754
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:19,880
like the strong force are much larger than spin two forces like gravity. Is there an underlying

755
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:26,520
reason for this or is it? Okay. That's a very good question. I think the free bonus of gravity

756
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:33,320
is not understood why gravity is the characteristic energy scale, the Planck energy,

757
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:39,080
is so much higher than anything we have explored. So this we also don't understand.

758
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:47,160
Here I can offer you a speculation. Okay. And this is just a wild speculation.

759
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:53,320
Why are humans so large compared to atoms and the fundamental particles?

760
01:33:54,040 --> 01:34:01,960
And the reason is entropy, right? If we are made up of 20 atoms or something or a few hundred atoms,

761
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:09,320
we would be very unstable. I mean, entropic effects would fall apart and so on and so forth.

762
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:17,080
It's hard to imagine that we can do anything like reproduce ourselves and create physics and so

763
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:23,320
if we made us a thousand particles. So whether it's a big number comes from 10 to the 23.

764
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:35,560
And the reason is gravity is so feeble is also has to be related to the fact that we are so huge

765
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:46,760
because even if gravity is a lot stronger, gravity would be crushing us as well.

766
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:54,520
So I don't know. That's just a speculation. I mean, I'm not talking about gravity being

767
01:34:54,520 --> 01:35:01,320
10 times stronger than it is now. Suppose the Planck mass instead of 10 to the 19 GV

768
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:10,200
is 10 to the 9 GV or something like this, 9 orders of magnitude. So gravity

769
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:17,400
would be 18 orders of magnitude stronger. I mean, we'll be crushed for sure, I think. So that may be

770
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:30,600
one speculation. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. Then I reckon we maybe have time for one more

771
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:39,720
question or should we say that's the final one? I'm fine answering a few more questions,

772
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:49,720
if you like. I mean, I will say we had at our peak, we had 400 people watching and now

773
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:59,720
actually it's gone down. We have slightly fewer now that the talk is nearing its end.

774
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:02,280
But they will be very, very active.

775
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:11,800
On YouTube, there will be a lot more views. I checked my talk in radio institutions

776
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:18,120
through a couple of months ago and a lot more views than that now. Anyway, I'm happy to answer a

777
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:28,680
few more questions. Yes. Let me see if I can find some good ones. So I guess there's a more

778
01:36:29,240 --> 01:36:37,640
not necessarily related to the subject of physics, but rather related to studying physics.

779
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:45,000
There is a person asking if it's too late for someone to pursue physics at the age of 25

780
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:52,520
and whether it will still be possible to get into academic field our research when starting at that age.

781
01:36:52,520 --> 01:37:00,920
I think this question is also a very good question. I'm asked for advice quite often.

782
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:08,440
This is a quite unusual question, but I think it's worth answering seriously.

783
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:16,600
I think that it's too complex for this question. One is institutional and societal or whatever

784
01:37:16,600 --> 01:37:23,640
you want to call it institutional. That when you're a certain age, it's very difficult to get

785
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:29,720
into a good graduate school, et cetera, because places are limited and so on and so forth.

786
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:39,480
Getting into a graduate school, a good graduate school, is important. I think getting into a

787
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:46,040
good undergraduate school is not so important because quantum mechanics taught at Stanford

788
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:50,920
and quantum mechanics taught at Bundak University is the same quantum mechanics.

789
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:58,520
When you get into graduate school, you hear things from the great masters and so on and so forth.

790
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:05,000
So that's an institutional question. If you're 25, it may be hard to get into physics,

791
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:13,640
but on the other hand, the second part of the question is, of course, it depends on your ability.

792
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:25,320
If you have strong enough mental abilities, never too late, why 25 should be cut off age?

793
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:35,400
Why not 35 and even 45 and so on? I don't completely subscribe to this thing that

794
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:42,280
Dirac said that if you are 25 and you haven't done anything in theoretical physics,

795
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:46,360
you might as well go kill yourself or something. I think that's an awful thing to say.

796
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:56,680
There are many examples of people who pursue other things and switch into physics quite late,

797
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:04,360
people that were in engineering and so on. So it's certainly possible, but it of course all

798
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:11,880
depends on your ability. I mean, Ed Whitten, I was on the admissions committee that admitted him

799
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:19,000
to graduate school at Princeton and he was a very special case because his undergraduate major

800
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:26,680
or sociology and he had not taken a single physics course. So he was admitted to Princeton

801
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:33,720
and some of the other graduate students complained to me, even said that who is this guy? He's

802
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:38,920
taking the undergraduate quantum mechanics course and he doesn't even understand classical

803
01:39:38,920 --> 01:39:43,480
mechanics. He's like asking us questions about Newton's, about classical mechanics.

804
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:49,800
But then at the end of the course, all the other students are going to him for help. So it depends

805
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:56,040
on your mental ability, obviously, rather than age. I mean, you can certainly find examples of people

806
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:06,840
that shown their brilliance later in life. So don't take what Dirac said seriously.

807
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:22,520
Okay. Thank you so much. And then I reckon, I guess this is, I'm going to take the opportunity

808
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:33,480
to ask a question of my own, actually, because I have that power. So when you were talking

809
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:45,000
a bit earlier on your slides about gauge fields and redundancy in description,

810
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:53,000
you mentioned something called twisters, that you mentioned that might be a way out of it.

811
01:40:53,000 --> 01:41:00,280
What is a twister? Is that something that can be explained? Well, you are in England. You just

812
01:41:00,280 --> 01:41:08,840
have to go those 83 miles. I remember it was 83 miles, right? You just have to move 83 miles,

813
01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:17,000
go over to Oxford and ask Roger Penrose. He'll be happy to explain to you. Okay. But in a word,

814
01:41:17,640 --> 01:41:24,920
read my quantum field theory book, the last part of my quantum field theory book, which is the stuff

815
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:33,480
I added after the first edition. There, modern-day people have done these calculations in QCD,

816
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:42,120
and for example, five gluon scattering. So in QCD, you have these gluons, Young-Mills particle,

817
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:48,840
two gluon scattering producing three. And I've forgotten how many, the exact number,

818
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:53,800
how many Feynman diagrams you have to use computers to calculate. And the result,

819
01:41:54,920 --> 01:42:01,880
when printed in a journal page at the usual resolution, it's just a doc smudge. I think

820
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:08,840
I showed this doc smudge in my quantum field theory book. But this calculation using twisters

821
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:22,520
could be done in one line, basically. Okay. So there's a better, there's a more common word

822
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:31,240
for twisters these days. People call it electricity spinners. Some of the people doing electricity

823
01:42:31,240 --> 01:42:36,440
spinners also told me that in the early days of the program, they don't want to call it twisters

824
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:42,920
because Roger has some other wild ideas and so on and so forth, as you guys all know.

825
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:48,840
And they don't want it to be confused with some of Roger's other ideas and so on and so forth.

826
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:57,960
So it's not called twisters now. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I'll have to go

827
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:06,840
to Oxford then. Yes, yes. Catch him before he goes to Stockholm. And when you see him,

828
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:14,520
you can thank him for, thank him for me. You said, for writing the preface to my book,

829
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:18,200
for writing the forward to my book, he wrote a very nice forward.

830
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:23,080
Other questions? Yeah.

831
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:30,120
Today is much higher level than the questions at the Royal Institution.

832
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:36,520
I mean, I guess we should thank the audience for that. They've all been brilliant and very,

833
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:46,120
and that's very, very interesting. Absolutely. I guess, I think we should probably wrap up at

834
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:56,760
this point, especially because there are many good questions still, but I don't think that most of

835
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:07,560
them can be answered in a short time. But thank you so much for the talk. And I mean, if we get

836
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:14,280
the opportunity, we would be happy to host you here some other time in Cambridge once this

837
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:23,880
pandemic ends. I should say to the people in the audience that, just as a reminder that we host

838
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:33,560
weekly talks, and we also have a talk next week by Paul Scheikin on using information

839
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:42,840
content to think about phases, which I hope many of you will attend. And in addition to that, we

840
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:49,080
also have, for the first year students at Cambridge, we have next week coming up a pub quiz

841
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:58,520
to help you get to know each other a bit better. And other than that, I think that's the end of

842
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:04,360
the stream. Thank you very much for the Archimedeans and have a good night.
