0	8960	Yeah, no, I will. So Matthew, when, when, when you start this string, just send me a
8960	16000	a notification, send me a little message and I'll, okay, the stream should be started.
16000	35400	Yeah, the streams should be started. Amazing. Amazing. Okay. So could the chat on YouTube
35400	41440	just confirm that they can hear what I'm saying? And then somebody in the chat on YouTube confirmed
41440	50120	they can hear what I'm saying. And then I'll, because we haven't done this before. Yes, amazing.
50120	60880	People can hear me. So hello, everyone. Welcome. Welcome to the annual Maxwell talk and Maxwell
60880	67960	lecture, which is co-hosted by the Cambridge University Physics Society and the Archimedes. The
67960	74600	talk this year will be given by Professor Anthony C, who's going to talk about quantum field theory
74600	82600	in a nutshell. Now, Anthony C holds a joint appointment as a permanent member of the Cavalier
82600	89040	Institute for Theoretical Physics and is also a professor at the University of California,
89040	94680	Santa Barbara. His main areas of research involve cosmology and the fundamental structures of
94680	101400	matter. And he's well known in the physics community for his unusual breadth of interest from
101400	109560	condensed matter physics to biophysics to high energy physics. And C obtained his PhD from
109560	117560	Howard in 1970, supervised by Sydney Coleman. And in the following years, he worked at the Institute
117640	128280	of Advanced Study and was the Alfred P. Sloan Fellow. In his first year as assistant professor at
128280	135400	Princeton, C had Ed Whitten as his teaching assistant. Professor C has authored and co-authored
135400	140920	more than 200 scientific publications and several books. He's written in particle physics, condensed
140920	146440	matter physics, anomalies in physics, random matrix theory, supergun activity, and many more.
146920	151640	We are very honored to have him with us here today to talk about quantum field theory.
153000	161640	Before we start the event, I would like to thank our sponsors, Seamless, Riverlane, TTP, TPP,
161640	167720	Define, JaneStream, and CGT for helping make this possible. And with that, I will let you have
167720	174680	added C after actually just pointing out four questions. If you post them in the YouTube chat,
174680	180200	we will be watching this. And if you have any interesting questions, I will read them out
180760	186280	and see, would you prefer to, oh, Tony, would you prefer to have questions during the talk or
186280	193720	afterwards? I think it would be better to have the questions after the talk. Okay, then we will have
193720	198920	the questions after the talk, but post them in the chat and we will keep tabs. And then I will
198920	208120	hand it over to you. Thank you very much, Oscar. I'm very honored to be giving the Maxwell lecture
208120	217800	for this year. So today, I'm going to talk about quantum field theory. And here is a picture of
217800	226120	the field, the lovely quantum field that we all would like to explore. Okay, so
226760	233640	quantum field theory is arguably the greatest monument to the human intellect.
234280	238600	Now, already you can hear the humanities professor snatching the teeth on the side.
239240	246520	But in any case, whatever, it is the most accurately tested theory in physics. This comes
246520	255400	as a surprise to some people. But as we will see for various reasons, it's tested to an extremely
255400	265080	high degree of accuracy, more than any other areas of physics. So it took us a couple of millennia
266360	272760	before we realized that the universe is actually pervaded with quantum fields. And in fact, as you
272760	281640	listen to this talk, you're surrounded by quantum fields. So today, this talk is addressed to students
281640	287320	and to people who do not know what quantum field theory is. So I'm going to start
288520	292600	with the question, what is quantum field theory and who needs quantum field theory?
293880	301080	And these days, actually, one doesn't even need to know quantum mechanics to be a professor
301080	308360	theoretical physics. Now, in this talk, I should caution the audience that whenever I speak about
308360	313800	physics, I mean theoretical physics, because that's what I know. I'm not speaking
315160	323640	of this. For whom I have only admiration, since they can do things that I cannot even dream of doing.
326120	333400	So who needs quantum field theory? And this is chapter 1.1 of my textbook on quantum field theory
333400	339320	is, in fact, the very first chapter. The book starts with the sentence, quantum field theory
340120	347160	arose out of our need to describe the ephemeral nature of life. This sentence was so widely quoted
347160	355000	that I now see it on the web in collection of quotes to my amusement. But what do I mean by that?
355000	363800	I'll explain. So the ephemeral nature of life, there's a saying about that, that life is just
363800	374680	like clouds and smoke, assing in front of our very eyes. And it's soon over. So, but more seriously,
374680	382040	there was meant to be a joke, but quantum field theory is needed when we confront simultaneously
382040	388680	the two great physics innovations of the last century of the previous millennium, namely special
388680	398600	relativity and quantum mechanics. And here I show you what I call the square of physics. So on this
398600	407720	axis, I've plotted the size of the objects involved. And on this axis, I've plotted whether the
408680	415480	objects involved are moving slowly or fast. So in this corner, we have Newtonian mechanics,
415480	424600	the classical physics of Newton, Maxwell, and Laplace. And as we go to smaller objects, we have
424600	431320	slow moving electrons scattering over proton, for example. There's no need for special relativity,
431320	438040	but you definitely need quantum mechanics. Now, we move up to this axis. Then, for example,
438040	443480	rocket ship moving near light speed, there's no need for quantum mechanics, but you definitely
443480	449560	need special relativity. So what we're interested in is moving into this
451000	456040	upper right corner, in which we have the marriage of quantum mechanics and special
456120	462680	relativity. And it's in this peculiar confluence of special relativity and quantum mechanics
463720	470760	that a new set of phenomena arises. Particles can be born and particles and die.
471720	481960	So this is a new subject in physics is required, a quantum field theory, to describe the birth and
481960	488520	death of some kind of life in between. So in particle, in classical physics, there's no such thing
489800	498760	of objects being born or objects going away. There's no such thing as birth and death. So this
498760	507640	is introduced by a new phenomenon, totally new phenomenon in physics. So let's remind ourselves
507640	515160	of two gold-plated equations of physics. The gold-plated equation of physics of quantum mechanics
516120	523240	is the uncertainty principle. So we're familiar with the fact that the uncertainty
523240	531640	in momentum times the uncertainty in position is equal to h bar, plans constant. So I'll set
531640	537240	plans constant equal to one for the purpose of this talk. So another version of the uncertainty
537240	545480	principle is that the uncertainty in energy is equal to one divided by the uncertainty in time.
546520	554120	So the advertising slogan for this gold-plated equation is that accounting errors could be
554120	560600	tolerated for a short time. So for a very short time, nature has to keep track of the conservation
560680	567720	of energy. But for a very short time, you could have some uncertainty in the energy.
569000	574440	Now, special relativity, on the other hand, tells us that energy is equal to matter,
575080	581400	and even the person, the man and woman in the street, know about the gold-plated equation of
581400	587160	special relativity, e equal to mc squared. And the advertising slogan for this is that counting
587160	596040	errors could be turning to stuff. So in one of my popular books, I spoke of an embezzler
597160	604600	working at a bank. So for a very short time, accounting errors could be tolerated. And of
604600	612840	course, the smaller the accounting error, it could be hidden for a long time. But if you take away
612840	620440	and walk away with $10 million, clearly that would be discovered very quickly. But that is just
620440	626440	fluctuations and accounting errors in quantum mechanics. But it's only with special relativity
626440	632280	that the accounting errors could be turned into stuff than Bezler could then buy himself or herself
632280	642200	and Lamborghini. So when we combine these two equations, particles could pop out of the vacuum
642200	650440	and they can pop into the vacuum. Parts can come into being and disappear. There's birth and death
650440	658040	in physics. So in order for this to happen, we need, as we can see from the previous transparency,
658680	663960	that we need both quantum physics and special relativity. One of them is not enough. We need
663960	674280	both. But these particles could not exist for a long time unless we know of two ways for them to
674280	683960	exist for a long time, which is that if extra energy is available, or if this is happening near
683960	690680	Black Hole Horizon. Now in contrast, I think many people in the audience have studied
690680	695240	non relativistic quantum mechanics, which is the subject before quantum field theory.
696760	702600	In non relativistic quantum mechanics, you have the Schrodinger equation. So no matter how you
702600	708440	shake and bake the Schrodinger equation, it's always the same number of particles. But you
708440	713240	cannot create more or less. If the Schrodinger equation describes three electrons, you're always
713240	722600	going to end up with three electrons. So let us now talk about fields. The concept of fields,
723640	736120	a heuristic pictorial motivation for a field is what I call a mattress. Well, a mattress is just a
736120	747480	bunch of points, mass points, point masses connected by springs in some lattice. So very far away on
747480	752040	distance scales much larger than the lattice spacing, this looks like a continuous field.
753000	758360	So if we're interested in physics on a distance scale much larger than the spacing between the
758360	764840	lattice, then this looks like a continuous field. And we can press down bounce up and down on this
764840	772440	mattress. And we can set up normal modes, vibrational modes, and we can form wave packets of these modes
773240	783240	and localize wave packets. So we can form a vibrational disturbance located in one area of the
784200	794920	of the mattress. And we can set this wave packet moving. So these wave packets can move around.
795720	802520	And if the springs are perfectly harmonic, then nothing much happens. But if the springs
803960	811480	have any amount of n-harmonicity, this would cause us the wave packets to motion with no
811480	817720	longer be harmonic. And these wave packets would scatter and decay and dissipate and so on.
818680	826360	So this was seized upon by the founders of quantum field theory in the early days
827560	833800	to perhaps could be used to represent particles, the particles that they were discovering at that time
835160	840280	right around the century. So right around the turn of the 20th century, for example,
840280	846280	Thompson discovering the electron. So let us consider a space-time diagram. If this is space,
846280	853640	this is time, then I could set up a disturbance here. And we could see in particles a packet of
853640	859560	energy and momentum moving in space-time. And then could be absorbed at some other location,
859560	868200	okay, on this mattress. So this, of course, in 30 seconds is the concept of going from a field
868200	879880	to a particle. Now, of course, I'm hardly describing quantum field theory in detail here,
879880	886120	but I'm just trying to motivate in some cartoon feature how a field, how the concept of field
886120	894120	could lead to a particle. Now going to the next slide, we go from the next step is to go from
894120	902840	particle to force. And I imagine a particle going back and forth. So this caption, I'm sorry, is
902840	909880	rather small. On this cartoon, it says the pie meson, the pion, is a marriage broker of old.
910680	919320	It's a rather obese lady going back and forth between two families. So this was strung from
919560	925000	me by an undergraduate a long time ago. The book was published 30 years ago. So
926200	932440	she must be quite grown by now. So in many cultures, we have marriage brokers going back and forth.
933080	939480	And by traveling back and forth, it produces an attraction between two families. So you could
939480	945880	think of the attraction between the two families as some kind of attractive force. So this is the
945880	952040	first inkling that quantum field theory could explain the forces we see in nature. We're going to
952680	959640	look at this in more detail. Well, you may be curious about where this cartoon comes from.
959640	970040	It is in fact taken from one of my books, Fearful Symmetry. I guess I have to go here.
970920	980920	So this book was written in around 1984. Steve, I was planning to write a book on quantum field
980920	987080	theory. But Steve Weinberg advised me that I should write a popular book before a textbook
987560	992520	on quantum field theory. And his reasoning, I think, is very sound. A lot of physicists
992920	1009080	write textbooks about any idea on how to communicate things to people. And Weinberg told me that if
1009080	1016680	you could explain things to the general public, then you'll qualify to write a textbook. So I
1016760	1025880	write to this advice and that helps people. Now, so excuse me. My book on Fearful Symmetry,
1027080	1036760	I show you the French translation here. And as you can see, Fearful, the French told me that
1036760	1041720	Fearful doesn't make any sense. You cannot have symmetry that are fearful. So you can see that
1042680	1051160	they change Fearful to some other word. So, but it was another amusing aside is that it
1051160	1057960	took 34 years since my book was published in 1984. Immediately after it was published,
1057960	1064360	it was translated into German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and so on. But French translation,
1064360	1070600	there was never a French translation. I was very puzzled by that. Until 2018, a couple years ago,
1071720	1079080	I took a sabbatical and I lived in Paris for a year. And as soon as I have a French address,
1079080	1085400	I have an address in Paris, the French publishers immediately took it seriously. And in fact,
1085400	1091960	in one day, I got two offers to translate my book. So that's just very amusing. So having,
1091960	1100040	I could tell you all that having an address in Paris is very high importance as far as the French
1100040	1110920	is concerned. Okay, so the Germans invited me to India to the Max Mule Baban. And the trip was
1110920	1118920	paid for by the United States State Department. I was quite surprised. And after this book came out.
1119640	1131560	And this is in fact, an article in the newspaper in Calcutta. But the title totally floored me.
1133080	1139880	It was somehow they treated me as a religious cult leader of some kind. So anyhow, after I came
1139880	1146840	back, I gave a talk in Mumbai. And this was then published in New Literary History, which is a
1147640	1153960	humanities journal published in the United States by the University of Virginia. And people
1153960	1159320	were always surprised. But so I went into this story to explain to you. When people look up this
1159320	1165560	article, they notice it's illustrated by works of Indian art. And that is why because the talk was
1165560	1176760	given in India. So I digressed a little bit into where that cartoon comes from. But I remind
1176760	1182920	you, it was a marriage broker going between two families and generating an attraction between the
1182920	1191560	two families. Now, this leads to my third theme, to the theme of particles to force my second theme,
1191560	1198120	sorry. Since the early days of physics, the notion of force has been among the most basic and the
1198120	1206120	most mysterious. So it was with considerable satisfaction that physicists finally understood
1206120	1212520	where forces come from. Their forces come from quantum exchange of a particle. I want to emphasize
1212520	1219480	this point. We are all students of physics. And when you first study physics, you learn about
1219480	1225240	forces. But if you ask the professor, where did the forces come from, they cannot answer you,
1225880	1232200	unless they know quantum field. Forces come from the quantum exchange of a particle. And that's one
1233080	1238440	one of the important results of quantum field theory. And given this understanding of the nature
1238440	1246920	of force in 1934, the Japanese physicist Yukawa Hideki Yukawa, whom I think many of you have heard
1246920	1253400	of, he decided that some kind of marriage broker must be provided for the strong interaction.
1254360	1262920	And so he hypothesized a new particle. And this is the pi meson. So this comes from the talk I
1262920	1268520	already mentioned to you that I gave him on by, and in fact, interestingly, it was at the National
1268520	1281080	Center for the Performing Arts. Now, the third theme that I now get to is going from particle to
1281080	1287880	force. So remember, I went from the mattress to field, from field to particle, and now I go from
1287880	1294920	particle to force. So another rough analogy, other than the marriage broker analogy that people use,
1295960	1302600	I think John Wheeler had used this a long time ago, that's to imagine two lumps on the mattress,
1303240	1305960	and they attract due to the distortion of the field.
1306040	1317080	So the physical world that we know results from the web of interactions.
1318920	1324360	And some attractive and some repulsive. I'm going to move my laptop closer to me.
1326920	1333560	Quantum field theory answers why. So again, when we started studying physics,
1336840	1341320	the professors tell us some forces are attractive and some forces are repulsive.
1343160	1349240	Now, to be able to compare what is attractive or repulsive, let's talk about between like objects,
1349800	1357880	so between the same objects. But if you ask the professor why, there is no why. So physicists
1357880	1363960	did not understand why some forces are attractive and why some forces are repulsive. In the physics
1363960	1369960	course, that's usually just stated as a fact. You take it as an experimental fact or else,
1370760	1379160	but quantum field theory actually tells you why. It turns out the sign depends on whether the spin
1379160	1385640	of the mediating particle is odd or even. Now, to me, this is a really profound result. I first
1385640	1391720	heard about this from Julian Schwinger when I took a quantum field theory course from him at Harvard,
1392360	1397560	and I was really blown away that there's such a simple rule that explains the universe,
1397560	1400760	whether some forces are attractive and some forces are repulsive.
1402280	1408600	And if you do the calculation, as I do in my book, you can see that the sign ultimately
1409160	1414280	could be traced to the difference between time and space. Because in the Minkowski metric,
1415160	1417800	for those of you who know what a Minkowski metric is,
1418040	1425560	there is a sign flip between time and space. So according to this rule,
1426200	1432200	then spin zero produces an attraction, and this is a strong nuclear force, the protons
1432200	1438520	and neutrons coming together. And that's exactly how Yukawa introduced the whole concept in the
1438520	1445720	first place. Then you need a spin zero particle to produce the strong force that holds the nucleus
1445720	1454200	together. And the spin one then produces a repulsion, and we all know that electromagnetism
1455080	1465960	like charges repel. So spin two, we go to spin two, and that's again an attraction. So just an
1465960	1473320	even on, so simple, so beautiful, it's amazing that this explains the universe. So that's gravity,
1473320	1479720	the graviton carries spin two, and that produces an attraction between the apple and Newton's head.
1483640	1490280	So this allows us to give a lightning history of the universe. The universal gravitation attraction
1490280	1500200	of Newton, which is due to the spin two particle, produces the instability that drives the formation
1500200	1506920	of structure in the early universe. Right, dense regions become denser still. That's because in
1506920	1512920	gravity everything attracts. So if you have some fluctuation in density in some region of the early
1512920	1519240	universe, where there's more matter than in other regions, these dense regions become denser. They
1519240	1525880	pull and matter to them, matter forward towards the denser regions. And this is a well-known
1525880	1534280	phenomenon in the universe, not only in the early universe, but also in our world. We all
1534280	1542680	know that the rich becomes richer. Now meanwhile, the photons and neutrinos, they're free streaming
1542680	1548360	because their interaction with the primeval matter was very weak, especially the neutrinos.
1549000	1555320	And so it's a kind of taxation. They take some of the energy and mass density away from the
1555320	1563080	dense region. And finally, the attraction between the protons due to the spin zero particle
1563080	1571400	of Yukawa ignites the stars and eventually form the rich variety of nuclei. And then finally,
1571400	1580040	these positively charged nuclei and the negatively charged electrons attract each other
1580360	1588600	due to the spin one particle and they produce atoms. And so the rest is history, as you know,
1588600	1598600	that eventually leads to us. So it's a beautiful history of the universe. And the entire history is,
1598600	1603560	according to quantum field theory, just based on this interplay between plus and minus signs.
1603720	1613560	Okay, the concept of field goes back to Faraday.
1616840	1623480	And Faraday is a remarkable person because he came up from almost a Kenzian
1624440	1629960	poverty. And without proper education, the mathematics of the continental philosophers
1630600	1637160	were beyond Faraday, who was compelled to invent his own pictorial language. So
1637880	1643320	the mathematics of the continental philosophers that Faraday said you could not possibly understand,
1644120	1648920	it just partial differential equations, which now every undergraduate in physics knows.
1650600	1655000	So but Faraday, since he didn't know any mathematics here to introduce the concept
1655000	1664840	of a field, imagine a field mediating between charged bodies. Now here I cannot resist
1665640	1672600	making a side remark about basic versus applied research. So if you were in charge of the Royal
1672600	1682360	Navy at the 19th century at the time of Faraday, would you support the research of a bunch of
1682360	1687880	strange people in the basement messing around with wires and frogs or with people who are trying
1687880	1695400	to breed stronger pigeons? Okay, so I say this because all around the world, certainly in the
1695400	1703080	United States, but in other countries as well that I have spent time in, in the last 10, 20 years,
1703080	1710680	there's a tremendous shift from theoretical to applied physics. Now Faraday is one of my great
1710680	1723160	heroes. And for obvious reasons, since he invented the word field. And a few months ago, I was invited
1723160	1731320	to give a talk at the Royal Institution in London. And I deeply regretted that because of this
1731320	1738520	epidemic, this pandemic, I was not able to lecture at the same platform that Faraday lectured from.
1739480	1746200	But I certainly talked of my, spoke of my admiration for Faraday. And I think that
1746200	1755000	physics students should look at Faraday's life as an inspiration. So now from Faraday, we get to Maxwell.
1755800	1763400	Maxwell's theory of the electromagnetic field, as we know, it contains two hidden symmetries
1763720	1772120	that will rock 20th century physics. One is relativistic invariance and the other is gauge
1772120	1780520	invariance. Now both of these symmetries were already contained in Maxwell's theory. But nobody,
1781160	1789640	including Maxwell, nobody in the 20th century, in the 19th century, noticed it. And so is it
1789640	1795800	conceivable that our present day theory also contains all kinds of hidden structure?
1798200	1804440	To me, that's, that's a possibility. Hidden structure that's waiting for young people
1805080	1812760	to discover. Just like Einstein discovered relativistic invariance hidden in Maxwell's
1812760	1821160	equation and Hermann Weyl discovers gauge invariance in Maxwell's theory. So in hindsight,
1821160	1827080	how is it that Maxwell did not see this? Well, I don't know how many of you have read Maxwell's
1827960	1834840	treatise. Okay, it's a terrible notation of the 19th century. Since he doesn't have vectors
1834840	1841560	and index notation, he writes out every component of everything. So nowadays, we think of four
1841560	1846440	Maxwell's equations or something like this. But for Maxwell, it was actually like 26 equations.
1847720	1853960	Everything is written down in component form. So when I teach electromagnetism in the United
1853960	1862920	States, I always ask the student why the magnetic field is called H. And I have almost never encountered
1862920	1869320	students who can answer this question. So I'll let you think about that. And this comes to another
1869320	1876760	one of my pet peeve, at least about American students, very few students are interested in
1876760	1883400	the history of physics. And personally, and I think quite a few of my colleagues around the world,
1884920	1890920	I just got an email from somebody in Germany, who agreed with me completely, that you really
1890920	1896200	cannot call yourself a theoretical physicist, if you don't know anything about the history of the
1896200	1906680	subject. But now Yang-Mills theory also has a terrible notation, because it's a redundancy in
1906680	1912200	description, those of you who study Yang-Mills theory or gauge theory, know that it has a lot of
1912200	1920040	redundant variables that have to be gotten rid of at the end of the day. So perhaps the twister
1921000	1928040	formalism of Roger Penrose is perhaps the first step in fixing this. By the way,
1929000	1935240	I've given this talk since my quantum field theory book came out something like 20 years ago,
1935240	1941640	in those 20 years I've given this talk in many, many places around the world in the United States
1941640	1949160	and more recently in India and in Stockholm. And so this transparency is written long, long before
1949880	1956440	Roger Penrose got the Nobel Prize, but I've always been an admirer of his twister program.
1957240	1964680	So incidentally, I mentioned my popular book Fearful Symmetry, and some of you know that I was
1964680	1975320	honored that Roger actually wrote the preface to my book, the forward to my book. So having that,
1975880	1983720	I guess a little bit of an ad, but having said this, let me now come back to quantum field theory.
1984680	1991800	So already in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the photon, namely the electromagnetic field,
1992520	1999320	is treated as a field, but not the electron. So the photon is a field, but not the electron. The
1999320	2005400	electron is treated as a particle. So that is the formalism in non-relativistic quantum mechanics.
2006040	2011400	Then you write down a Schroding equation for this electron, and then you couple in the photon field.
2012840	2017960	This is what people in the United States, I don't know what people would call it in England,
2017960	2024120	but people in the United States, or at least I call it a half-assed treatment. It's absolutely bizarre
2025000	2032040	to treat one particle as a field and not the other. So this motivated Jordan, Heisenberg,
2032040	2040360	Dirac, and others to introduce the field. In particular, Dirac treated the electron as a field.
2040360	2047800	So henceforth, the electron has become a field. Now the next very important step was taken by
2047880	2054840	Fermi, and most people do not realize this, which is that Fermi said photons can be created,
2055720	2062360	so the electron can also be created. So that's what I emphasize in my introduction, birth and death,
2063400	2066680	because this in the weak interaction, the electrons come zooming out.
2068280	2073480	And the famous, the eminent authorities, the older people at that time, they all said the
2073480	2079880	electron was already inside a nucleus. It's obvious. And Heisenberg wrote that as a younger
2079880	2086920	physicist, he got angry letters from older people saying that Heisenberg, you're a crazy guy,
2086920	2092200	you know, we know that the electron is inside a nucleus. And how can you agree with Fermi
2092200	2098680	that the electron was created in the weakened action? Okay, so I'm writing about this in a book
2098680	2106040	I'm working on about how the younger generation got bashed by the older physicists. So here's the
2106040	2115240	lesson for the students at Cambridge University. Don't listen to those old guys. Okay, so after
2115240	2121560	that, all particles are excitations in some field. The electron is an excitation electron field.
2122920	2128200	The proton is an excitation in the proton field. We don't talk about protons anymore.
2128680	2135080	But we talk about quarks. So quarks are excitation in some quark field. So from in this point of
2135080	2141080	view, the graviton is just like a particle, like any other particle, it's just an excitation
2142120	2148520	in the gravitational field. And this is the philosophy pushed by Weinberg in his textbook on
2148520	2157000	gravity. And Weinberg is sort of anti the geometrical interpretation. But this is a very
2157000	2163560	minority view. Somehow, the gravitational field seems to be special, seems to be different from
2163560	2171640	all other fields. So somehow also responsible, the gravitational field is responsible for the
2171640	2181800	spacetime arena in which all particles work and play. So in my book, I use an analogy. This is
2181800	2188600	like an avant-garde theater, somehow there's no stage. But one of the actors is the stage.
2189240	2194760	The other actors are all climbing over him. So somehow the gravitational field is somehow
2194760	2201320	different. And I think this is the trouble that we face in trying to formulate quantum gravity.
2202200	2208040	And then we now have this, the biggest problem in theoretical physics now is to understand the
2208040	2215720	cosmological constant, why it's so small. So once we introduce gravity, we introduce a new
2215720	2222920	constant into nature, not just H bar and C, as I mentioned before, but also Newton's constant.
2222920	2229000	So the square of physics becomes a cube of physics. But I don't have time to go into this,
2229000	2234120	because this is not a talk about gravity. The talk about gravity I gave at the Royal
2234120	2242600	Institution a few months ago. Okay, so this is one of the puzzles in theoretical physics today,
2243560	2247480	which I hope some young people in the audience would be able to resolve.
2251000	2258040	So anyway, as Oscar mentioned, the first year I was an assistant professor at Princeton,
2258040	2265640	the very first course I ever taught in my life, that is, in my entire life, there was the first
2265640	2272520	time I was in charge of a course for students. I taught a course on quantum field theory.
2274040	2281000	And so people at that time, after the course, many people asked me to write up my notes as a book.
2281320	2287960	But other people, of course, gave me more practical advice, which is that you better not write a textbook
2287960	2297480	until you get tenure. So I waited for many years, for 30 years before I wrote my textbook, in 2003.
2298200	2305880	So here's the cover of the original edition of my quantum field theory book. And what it is,
2305880	2312440	what it is, is this painting shows the student, here's the student. The student is trying to reach
2313160	2318760	the field, the green field, quantum field theory. But in order to reach the field,
2318760	2325160	he or she has to hack through all of these weeds and so on and so forth. He has to learn a lot of
2325960	2332120	undergraduate level physics before he can reach the field. And once he gets past the field,
2332200	2337080	then he could start climbing the mountain. And we don't know what is on the other side of the
2337080	2349320	mountain. It may be string theory, it may be something else. So that's 2003. And seven years later,
2350520	2356920	came out with a revised edition and added a lot of new material. It turns out in those seven years
2356920	2366680	from 2003 to 2010, there were quite a few new developments that are important. So one of them
2366680	2377160	is in fact the flowering of Penrose's Twister program in application to quantum chromodynamics.
2380200	2384040	And my quantum field theory book has since been translated into other languages.
2384760	2388680	And the most amusing thing so recently was translating to Japanese.
2390840	2398280	The Japanese publisher told me that the Japanese have smaller hands and they cannot hold the
2398280	2403400	quantum field theory book. It's too thick. So my quantum field theory book got chopped into
2403400	2411240	two volumes. This is volume one, it just came out. So I just received a copy. But the translation
2411400	2418840	Russian is very amusing. You can see my name up here in quantum field theory in a nutshell.
2419400	2426920	But it turns out nutshell doesn't mean anything in Russian. I don't know why. Is it because they
2426920	2434440	don't have nuts in Siberia? I don't know. So the title was translated as quantum field theory in
2434440	2440520	two words. And so all my Russian friends are laughing that I've now published a book with
2441400	2445880	a logically inconsistent title. The title already has more than two words.
2449880	2455720	So now I want to also talk about a little bit more about the quantum field theory. One of the
2456680	2462600	most interesting things about quantum field theory in the last 30, 40 years is the rise
2462600	2469240	of field theory in condensed matter physics. So this is, I want to say this is distinct from
2469240	2475800	earlier use of perturbative field theory. So for example, when I was a student, there were two
2475800	2483800	textbooks Federer and Wallachka and Abrikosov and Al. They use Feynman diagrams just to keep track of
2483800	2491320	some perturbation theory calculation when they do perturbative calculations. So but the rise of
2491320	2500440	field theory in the last 30 years of the 20th century was quite spectacular. And it's not
2501720	2508360	merely using Feynman diagrams to do perturbative stuff. So I mentioned several examples that
2509000	2513320	in the quantum Hall fluid, the microscopic degrees of freedoms will cause the electrons.
2514120	2518200	But the long distance physics is controlled by as to turn Simon's gauge field
2519000	2525960	with fractionally charged excitations. Another example surface growth can be connected,
2527240	2532760	can be studied using the language of renomization group. And another is that disorder
2534040	2539800	can be studied by the replica method and supersymmetry. So here I also want to mention
2539800	2544760	another characteristic of my book. So this is one characteristic of my book because I think
2544760	2550040	this is important. So that if you ask me, how is my quantum field theory book different
2550760	2556600	from other quantum field theory book is because I include one third of the book is on condensed
2556600	2562600	matter physics, maybe one quarter. And the other thing is I introduce gravity as early as possible.
2563320	2568840	So when I was a graduate student, nobody mentions gravity unless you take course on
2568840	2573480	general relativity and gravity and so on. But nobody would mention gravity in a course on
2573560	2579480	quantum field theory. I never heard a single word about gravity in my courses on quantum field
2579480	2586200	theory. But now, of course, it's taken central center stage. So the other feature of my book
2586920	2593960	is I try to be much lighter in tone in the formalism. So I introduce a lot of stories,
2593960	2600360	jokes, fictitious characters a la Galileo. I introduce a character named Confusio and Confusio
2600360	2606760	is always wandering around my book. And now I get emails from students saying Confusio is their
2606760	2615800	famous character. And I even have a that even recently, a professor Berkeley said on the internet
2615800	2623400	that he is Confusio that he's confused about a lot of things. The other thing about my book
2623400	2633640	on quantum field theory is divided into eight parts. And this is also a joke. I was referring
2633640	2640280	to something in Chinese literature. I was referring to the eight parts of the celestial dragon.
2640840	2647880	And for those Chinese students in the audience who knows who Jin Yong is, you can look up this link.
2648360	2659560	So now I want to tell you that quantum field theory has had two near death experiences.
2659560	2670360	Quantum field theory actually almost died twice. Okay. So in the late 1940s, there was its first
2670360	2676600	death. Because it was unable to produce Lorentz covariant results and divergences.
2677320	2681480	And it was not able to handle the strong intention. The strong intention that time
2682200	2688440	was the theory of Yukawa's. And because of the coupling is very strong, the Feynman diagrams
2689160	2695400	and other perturbative approaches are completely useful and were completely useless.
2695960	2701400	And so people like Landau go as far as to say that quantum field theory should be buried.
2702360	2708520	I'm quoting Landau, this quote in my new book on quantum field theory.
2711720	2718840	And interestingly, it's people like Landau and I think also Newsboro, Heisenberg,
2718840	2725560	all those people saying quantum field theory was dead. Interestingly, it was the young people
2725640	2733080	who came out of the in the late 1940s. They were the conserved. The older people were the
2733080	2738440	revolutionary. So sometimes we call them the revolutionary conservatives. And you know whom
2738440	2744600	I'm talking about. I'm talking about people like Feynman and Schwinger and Tomonaga.
2745800	2752520	And the next second time that quantum field theory almost died is in the late 1960s when the S
2752520	2759480	Matrix School came into being. And this was the ability to deal with the strong intention.
2760360	2768440	And so I had to make a very difficult choice between going to when I was going to graduate school.
2769160	2774760	I had to make a difficult choice between going to Harvard or going to Berkeley. And if I'd gone
2774760	2779400	to Berkeley, that would be the end of me. Because at that time Berkeley was the center of the S
2779400	2789880	Matrix School. And in which quantum field theory is looked on as some old ancient thing that nobody
2789880	2797320	cares about anymore. But no, in the 1970s, as you all know, thanks to the work of the young genius
2797400	2805880	Behoeft from Holland, quantum field theory triumphed. And as my professor,
2805880	2813240	Sidney Coleman later wrote, the triumph of field theory in the 1970s was a victory parade
2814120	2821880	that made the spectators gasp with joy. I'm sorry, I can't even read, gasp with awe and laugh with joy.
2822760	2826600	So I'm here also, I also wanted to tell you something for you to think about.
2827320	2831400	I'm not going to explain that here, quantum mechanics is like a zero plus one dimensional
2831400	2839320	field theory. And string theory is like a one plus one dimensional field theory. Okay, now let me go
2839320	2851080	backwards and talk about quantum mechanics. Now when we teach quantum mechanics or when we learn
2851080	2858280	quantum mechanics, depending on whether you are a professor or a student, usually we talk about the
2858920	2866280	Schrodinger or Heisenberg formalism. Schrodinger has wave functions and Heisenberg has operators.
2867080	2874760	But there's a conceptually more profound formalism due to Dirac and Feynman. It's called the Dirac-Feynman
2874760	2880920	path integral formalism, or the Schrodinger functional integral formalism. And of course,
2880920	2887640	Schrodinger and Feynman's formalism are equivalent. And this leads naturally to quantum field theory.
2888680	2894040	So let's ask about the origin of the path integral. Let me explain the origin
2894840	2902040	of path integral formalism. So in quantum mechanics, immediately in chapter one,
2902040	2908440	we learn about the two slit experiment. So electrons are emitted from a source.
2909560	2917000	And there's a screen where detector is placed, oh, this detector. And between the
2917560	2924360	screen and the source, there's another screen, which has two slits in it. And so the electron
2924360	2930680	could either go through this slit and or to go through that slit. And then there's an amplitude
2930760	2937080	probability amplitude for going through one slit and the probability for going through another slit.
2937080	2942280	And then you're supposed to add the probability amplitude. And you see the quantum interference
2942280	2948840	phenomenon and so on and so forth. Now here's an interesting comment. Students almost never ask,
2948840	2955560	what is three holes? I have also taught quantum mechanics. And I've never met a student who asked,
2955560	2962200	what if you had three holes in the screen? Okay. So in my quantum field theory book,
2962200	2967880	I imagine a student named Feynman asking this question. By the way, there's so many Feynman
2967880	2974360	stories circulating on the web. And I feel, why not if people can make up Feynman stories,
2974360	2982840	I can make one up too. So I imagine a student named Feynman asking, what if you have three holes?
2983480	2988520	Okay. So the professor then explained, okay, well, you just add the amplitude. So going through
2988520	2996040	these three holes. And then Feynman asked, what if you add another screen? And also with a bunch
2996040	3004440	of holes in it. And the professor is starting to get impatient and losing his patience. And the
3004440	3011800	professor said, come on, don't waste my time. You just add all the amplitudes. There's an
3012040	3016600	probability amplitude for going through this hole. And then this hole, and then this hole,
3016600	3025640	and you just add them all up. Okay. So, but this student persists. And he asked the most
3025640	3034680	zen question of all, what if you add infinite number of screens and drill infinite number
3034680	3046440	of holes in each screen? Okay. So then there is no screen. If you have infinite number of screens
3046440	3052360	with infinite number of holes. And so you have to add amplitudes over all paths. So it's like a
3052360	3060760	young person. Reach the end of your life. Now all possibilities are open up to you. Okay.
3061560	3069080	So we now have to add up not all the amplitudes through each hole, as the professor was saying,
3069800	3079480	but you now have to integrate over all paths. Okay. So this very zen question, having an infinite
3079480	3088360	number of screens with an infinite number of holes in it, is the origin of the path integral
3088360	3099000	formalism invented by Dirac and Feynman. Okay. So quantum field theory, there amongst an integral.
3099000	3105320	So I'm saying, I was just saying here, oops, normal in quantum mechanics, which we talked about
3105320	3111960	adding the summing over the paths. But if you have infinite number of paths, you integrate over
3111960	3118200	all possible paths. So when all is said and done, you introduce formalism and so on.
3118760	3126200	Quantum field theory, just one great big fancy sum or integral. So as you can see, sometimes
3126200	3132360	if I give this popular talk to a general audience, it depends on what the audience is. I may even
3132360	3137320	have to explain, the audience may not even know what an integral is, and I have to tell them it's
3137320	3143880	a big fancy sum. And the integral is, but this audience of course knows what an integral is.
3143880	3150680	It's an integral over d phi, e to the minus s phi, some function, some function of phi.
3151400	3158360	And phi is the field, a generic notation for the field. It depends on space and time.
3159160	3164440	And the space can be d dimensional. Then you can, you have written the quantum field theory
3164440	3170680	in d plus one dimensional space time. Now, how do we get the quantum mechanics? Quantum mechanics
3171960	3179560	is when you restrict this field to be just a function of time, but not of space. And then
3179560	3187880	this field has another name, just to confuse the undergraduates. In undergraduate courses,
3187880	3195560	it's called position or coordinate of the particle, position of the particle. And so that you recognize
3195560	3201320	is quantum mechanics. If phi represents the position of particles, that is the path integral
3201320	3207480	formalism of, this is the path integral formalism of quantum mechanics. So quantum mechanics can be
3207480	3214360	thought of as zero plus one dimensional field theory. Now, I have also worked on random matrix
3214360	3221320	theory. And random matrix theory is to say phi is not even a function of time, but it's a matrix.
3222120	3227960	Then it's just an integral over all possible matrices. So random matrix theory could be imagined,
3228600	3234280	could be thought of as a zero plus zero dimensional space time. And one of the things I did
3235480	3242520	in quantum field theory, sorry, in random matrix theory was to develop with the French
3242520	3251640	physicist Edouard Brezon how to treat this using Feynman integrals. So we introduce Feynman diagrams
3251640	3260360	into random matrix theory. And finally, students can see if I go down, I can go down to ordinary
3260360	3266760	integral calculus in which the matrix is just replaced by a number by real number. Then that's
3266760	3273080	as an ordinary integral in calculus. So you see quantum field theory, if you like, is a generalization
3273080	3281880	of the integral in calculus. So 80 years of quantum field theory, a big part of it is,
3281880	3288760	consists of finding methods or tricks to do the functional integral. So one example is that people
3288760	3295080	then put this integral, discretize it, sort of going backwards from Newton, going backwards
3295080	3301480	from Newton and lightness, replace the integral by a sum, and then use computer to crank away.
3302920	3307800	So that's one area of physics you could go into, which is called lattice gauge theory.
3310040	3316680	Now, so we have an integral to do, which we don't know how to do. So as I said, the
3318200	3323880	path integral in quantum field theory, you can think of the simplest version of it just an
3323880	3329400	ordinary integral. So let me give you an ordinary integral you don't know how that you cannot do.
3330520	3335320	We all know that without this term, without this 5-4 term, we can all do this integral.
3335320	3341320	So if I cover up the 5-4 term, this is just a Gaussian integral that many of you know how to do.
3342200	3349800	But how do you do this? This integral is not known. Now there's a fabulous idea, which is
3350440	3359880	one way of doing this integral is to expand it in G. So we just expand this in a Taylor series.
3360680	3365720	And then these are all Gauss versions of the Gaussian integral. I told you this integral,
3367000	3372200	e to the minus m square phi square is doable and also doable with 5-4n.
3372760	3378280	Now I can do this integral and sum it all back up. But then there are many, many terms,
3378360	3388360	infinite number of terms. And the fabulous idea is to just draw little diagrams to keep track of
3388360	3397080	all these terms. So I still remember when I was an undergraduate, I was really eager to learn about
3397080	3404440	Feynman diagrams, which I had heard so much about. And then later I realized Feynman diagrams is just
3404440	3413240	based on this idea of expanding the path integral and then integrating term by term
3413240	3419160	and then draw diagrams to keep track of the terms. But it was a fabulous idea and nobody
3419160	3430120	else had this idea. It was amazing. So in my quantum field theory book, I talk about some
3430120	3436360	different versions of quantum field theory or Feynman diagrams. I could do a baby version and
3436360	3446120	a baby version is exactly this. So talking about Feynman, I want to show you guys,
3446120	3452120	so show you students because it's also a hope to inspire the students in the audience.
3452760	3456280	I want to show you Feynman's last blackboard in case you haven't seen it.
3456280	3466760	And he sets impossible standards for himself on the two upper left boxes. One of them is
3468280	3473960	what I cannot create. I do not understand. And this is an impossible demand, obviously.
3473960	3479160	Know how to solve every problem that has ever been solved. But anyway, some of you might take
3479160	3487240	this as your slogan. But also note he has a box called to learn. I don't know if you can see,
3487240	3492440	it's not very clear, but you can make out this stage to learn. The second box on the right.
3493160	3498360	And the interesting thing about all the things he wanted to learn, he crossed out one of them.
3500360	3507960	Okay, I have learned it. So that's it. Okay. So that's very admirable. Now I also want to mention
3507960	3518280	that after Feynman died, I visited Caltech. And just for one day, and they let me sit in
3518280	3523960	Feynman's office. So I just thought, oh, I would look at his blackboard. But unfortunately,
3523960	3529160	somebody had erased everything already. It's just a blank blackboard. And I sat there in this empty
3529160	3536760	office. And I thought, well, maybe I could get some secret vibes and get some good ideas. But
3536760	3546760	unfortunately for me, nothing happened. So now come from Feynman, we get to Schringer. So Schringer,
3546760	3553720	in 1948, Schringer calculated the first term of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron,
3554280	3560920	beating Feynman. So Schringer is so proud of this, that he was managed to beat Feynman. Feynman was
3560920	3566120	not able to calculate it. By the way, a lot of people don't know this. And they just thought
3566120	3572440	Feynman did, Feynman did, Feynman did, Feynman did. But Schringer actually beat Feynman. And so the
3572440	3579880	expression for the magnetic moment of the electron is actually carved on Schringer's tombstone. So
3579880	3585720	if you ever visit the other Cambridge, that is to say Cambridge, Massachusetts, you should
3588040	3594280	go check up, you should go look at this tombstone and pay your respect to Julian Schringer.
3595240	3601720	So Dirac, of course, had given any moment of the electron, but we are talking about
3601720	3608680	deviation from Dirac's value. So Dirac's calculation was not based, did not use quantum
3608680	3619080	field theory. Of course, Dirac was inventing quantum field theory. So I show you the current value for
3619080	3624840	the anomalous magnetic moment. The muon in some suitable unit is given by this, and you can see
3624840	3632040	it's measured to 10 to the minus 11. And people have now calculated all these digits, but Schringer
3632040	3640920	got the 116. Now to put this accuracy, that's what I said in the beginning of this lecture,
3640920	3651080	that quantum field theory is the most accurately tested theory in physics. Newtonian mechanics
3651080	3657800	is not tested to the 10 to the minus 11 level. So to put this accuracy in rough pictorial perspective,
3659720	3670040	consider the distance between Cambridge and Oxford via A41, 421. That distance is 83 miles.
3670040	3677800	Then the present uncertainty of 10 to the minus 11, it corresponds roughly to the minus 3 millimeter.
3678600	3685640	And for this to make any sense, I looked up the width of a human hair. So it turns out human hair
3686600	3691480	varies whether you have fine hair or coarse hair, different races of different thickness.
3692440	3700040	So this is maybe something like one tenth the width of a human hair. So just imagine that
3700040	3710600	this is from Cambridge and Oxford. By the way, I told you to visit the other Cambridge.
3711480	3718280	If you have a chance, you should also visit the other Oxford. My son is actually a professor
3718360	3726920	of biology at the other Oxford in the United States. Okay, so here I show you Schringer's Triumph
3728760	3733240	in which you beat Feynman. And this is taken from my quantum field theory book.
3733240	3739000	So here's a Feynman diagram in which the photon comes in and it interacts with the electron.
3739640	3745800	And so this is what the rack calculated. And what Schringer calculated is this one.
3746600	3753000	So in the process, the electron emits a photon, which is then absorbed by the outgoing electron.
3753800	3756920	And Feynman was not able to calculate this, but Schringer did.
3761640	3770920	So as I said, I took quantum field theory courses from Schringer. He was the king
3770920	3777560	at Harvard physics department at the time. And Schringer was not very pleased.
3777560	3782840	And one of his famous saying is that Feynman brought quantum field theory to the masses.
3784040	3789320	So and I think Schringer is more or less right that nowadays you just learn the Feynman rules.
3789320	3795960	You draw a few diagrams, you stick in, then you follow the Feynman rules and you just
3795960	3801720	calculate away. If you can't do the integral, you stick it on a computer. And so in fact,
3801720	3807880	one of my colleagues in Israel, a professor in Israel, he used to refer some to some of his
3807880	3814200	colleagues in physics as professors of Feynman diagrams. That was at derogatory terms. People
3814200	3818760	don't understand physics, but can calculate Feynman diagrams. So that's what Schringer said.
3819240	3826120	So now naturally, at Harvard, at that time, and this is Paul Martin, so I'll tell you who Paul
3826120	3832440	Martin is. He's a very famous condensed matter physicist who passed away a few years ago.
3833080	3840360	He was one of Schringer's prize students. And he was in generation. He's probably 20 years
3840360	3845560	older than I am. When I was a student, I took Paul Martin's course. Also,
3845560	3854520	and Paul Martin was a Schringer's student. And so he was describing the situation a generation
3854520	3862280	ahead of me. And he said, in the dark recesses of the subbasement of Lyman, Lyman is the name
3862280	3868600	of the building that the Harvard physics department was located in. So where theoretical
3868600	3873880	students retired to decipher the tablets, and of course, tablets doesn't mean tablet computer
3873960	3882280	at those days. It just means a notebook and where the ritual taboo on pagan pictures could
3882280	3890840	be safely ignored. So this is still true when I was a student, maybe 15, 20 years later.
3892040	3899080	Some of my friends were students of Schringer's. And Schringer would assign them some calculation
3899080	3905240	to do. Now, as I said, of course, Schringer can do it in his own formalism.
3906600	3912600	But it is much, much easier to do calculations, Feynman diagrams. That's why Feynman diagrams
3912600	3921000	are so popular. So some of these students told me they would hide somewhere and do the calculation
3921000	3926840	using Feynman diagrams. And then after they get the result, they would try to translate it back
3926840	3932680	into Schringer's formalism. And of course, they show Schringer the result without showing how they
3932680	3943320	got it. So here's another picture, the rivalry between the two grades. And you see this was
3943320	3949880	at the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm in 1965. And interestingly, this must be right after the
3949880	3956120	ceremony, because you can see Schringer still holding, he has taken off one of his white gloves,
3956120	3961720	but he still have the other white gloves on. And here's Feynman. And this picture, I'm going to
3961720	3971160	include this picture in the book I'm working on right now, because it really shows the very
3971160	3978040	different personality. Feynman is, you can see talking away and who knows what BS is spouting.
3978760	3985000	And Schringer is very, very typical. He doesn't sit, even sit straight. He sort of always sits at
3985000	3990840	an angle. And in this picture, maybe to sort of get away from Feynman as far as he could.
3991720	3998280	Anyhow, I'm just speculating, of course, I have the greatest admiration for both of these guys.
3998280	4008120	Those are these guys are tremendous. I really like Feynman. And one reason I really like Feynman
4008120	4014440	was because once at some conference, he invited me to go with him to some nightclub. Now I cannot
4014520	4019400	even imagine Schringer doing such. I can't even imagine Schringer ever going to a nightclub,
4019400	4029880	but Feynman is like the opposite. And by the way, I recommend you guys to read an essay by
4029880	4036680	Deser. And also through Google, you can find a Deser or Schringer student. And he wrote an essay
4036680	4043720	about a tale of two voices, about the contrast between Feynman and Schringer. And it's fascinating
4043720	4053880	because Deser is now, Deser is 15 years older than I am. And so he belongs to the older generation,
4053880	4062040	and he knew both of them quite well. So he was really able to compare these two people to amazing
4062040	4070280	geniuses. So I want to now talk about some of the landmarks in quantum field theory. And
4071240	4077320	Heisenberg introduced us to internal space by inventing isospin. And Hermann Weill
4078280	4085640	introduced gauge symmetry. And then Yang-Mills and others generalized the gauge symmetry of
4085640	4093160	vial to non-ambient gauge symmetry. So these are landmarks. And as I said, Landau and the
4093160	4098200	earlier generation thought that quantum field theory is dead. But in the 70s, people like
4098200	4105400	Weinberg and Glasshauer and so on resurrected things through the work of Tohoft, who resurrected
4105400	4111320	quantum field theory. And now we know that all three interactions are described by Yang-Mills theory.
4113320	4119960	So undergraduates are justifiably fascinated by Yang-Mills theory, the weakened action and all
4119960	4129960	these things. And in my most recent book published by Princeton, and which come out in October 2020,
4129960	4136840	that is right now. It's called Fly by Night Physics. I give a very simple introduction for
4136840	4144280	undergraduates in part nine of this book. And I know that undergraduates could understand some of
4144280	4149000	this because I have tried it out on the undergraduates here in Santa Barbara.
4150600	4157240	So I talk a little bit about quantum field theory. So great triumph. Feynman diagrams
4158920	4165000	revolutionized quantum field theory. And for many years, the influence of Feynman diagrams was
4165000	4172120	enormous. So even when I was in graduate school, I was told by one professor that quantum field
4172120	4178760	theory is equal to the sum of Feynman diagrams. Okay, we now know that this view is wrong.
4179800	4185400	That Feynman diagram just perturbative. So one of the important things that happened in the
4185400	4193400	mid 1970s, a new generation of young people came on the scene. I already mentioned Tohoft,
4194360	4202200	and also Polikoff. I've described it in my book as breaking the shackles of Feynman diagrams.
4202840	4209080	They discover all kinds of non-perturbative structure, such as magnetic monopoles, that cannot
4209080	4216200	be seen by Feynman diagrams. So these go like e to the minus one over g square in the answer. So
4216200	4221160	imagine that integral that I showed you earlier. Suppose the answer has a term that depends on
4221160	4227560	this. Them expanding in powers of g as a Taylor series wouldn't make any sense if you never see
4227560	4234280	this. And all kinds of things appeared in quantum field theory, duality, topology, all kinds of
4234280	4240440	things. And for example, when I talk about the application of quantum Hall effect that has to
4240440	4249800	do with duality and topology. And all that you cannot see in Feynman diagrams by Feynman diagrams.
4250360	4258200	So I see it's now my time is already 11 o'clock. So some of you may be getting
4258840	4265720	a little bit anxious. So I am coming to the end of my talk. I'm going to wrap up. I'm going to wrap
4265720	4273080	up by asking a question, which is what is the purpose of studying physics? I like to ask the
4273080	4281400	students in my class this question. And no, to make money is not the correct answer. Well,
4281400	4287640	it may work. It is the correct answer for some people. And I do have one student who worked with
4287640	4296760	me and gotten a PhD on a random matrix theory, who is now a big shot on Wall Street. But to me,
4296760	4304440	the purpose of studying physics is to understand nature and not just to calculate
4304440	4311080	and to fit to some experiment, but to understand nature at a deep level and at a deeper and deeper
4311080	4320920	level. Okay, so quantum field theory, tell us to understand, help us to understand nature at a
4320920	4327560	deeper level than quantum mechanics. So now I want to talk about intellectual completeness of
4327560	4335320	different areas of physics. And what do I mean by intellectual completeness? Let me give you an
4335320	4343000	example. So for example, the Pauli exclusion principle and the spin statistics connection
4343960	4350360	that which says that particles to integer spin, integers spin at bosons, and we have
4351480	4361560	spins of fermions. And duck and Sudarshan, by the way, I shouldn't pronounce this word as duck,
4361560	4368120	but since I'm a Chinese American, I could be excused. He would be very upset if he heard
4368920	4373960	pronounced it like that, because he's German. And of course, there's an umlaut about the you.
4374600	4382040	And it's actually Duke. Duke and Sudarshan wrote a very interesting book, which I recommend to
4382040	4388440	students. So again, I've been ranting and raving about how American students don't know anything
4388440	4395880	about history. It's about the history of the Pauli exclusion principle. And this is especially,
4395960	4403400	I think, of interest to young British physicists, because the first person to propose the exclusion
4403400	4411080	principle was actually a young Englishman named Stoner. And what Duncan Sudarshan said was that
4411080	4417240	there's not one fact in the physical world, which has a greater impact on the way things are. Now,
4417240	4421960	this is a very strong claim about one fact in the physical world, which has a greater impact.
4422680	4428760	And in some sense, they're right, from atoms to neutron stars to lasers, and much of condensed
4428760	4434920	matter physics, for example, band structure, superconductivity, et cetera, et cetera. All of this
4434920	4440920	depends on the Pauli exclusion principle, right? But this is just a rule in non relativistic quantum
4440920	4446600	mechanics. What I always tell students when they're taking a course on non relativistic quantum
4446600	4453800	mechanics is to ask the professor, where does this rule come from? And the professors wouldn't
4453800	4458440	know the answer if it sticks to non relativistic quantum mechanics, because in non relativistic
4458440	4464040	quantum mechanics, it's just an empirical rule. It just fell down from heaven. Okay.
4465560	4471240	But quantum field theory can derive the Pauli exclusion principle, Pauli exclusion principle
4472200	4477960	and the spin statistics theorem can be derived. So this is what I mean by intellectual completeness.
4477960	4484360	Quantum field theory is more complete than quantum mechanics. There are things that in
4484360	4491240	quantum mechanics have to be treated as an arbitrary rule, but which can be derived in quantum field theory.
4494760	4497640	So how do you know all the electrons in the world are identical?
4498520	4503720	They could have been made in a factory somewhere, and there's manufacturing defects.
4503720	4508360	One electron is slightly different from the others. How do you know? And we need quantum
4508360	4515720	field theory to explain this. And the explanation is so elegantly simple that it has to be right.
4516440	4520280	But all the electrons are identical because as Dirac and others told us,
4520920	4527320	this is excitations in the quantum, in the electron field, the excitations in the same field.
4529080	4533960	So, but again, in non relativistic quantum mechanics, who knows, this was a God given
4533960	4541480	rule or something. Okay. Why is the electron charge exactly equal in magnitude to the proton
4541480	4548280	charge? This is one of the most important facts of the universe. If not the electrostatic repulsion
4548520	4552680	between different parts of the universe would blow the universe apart.
4554440	4560600	But quantum electrodynamics in this sense is less complete than grand unified field theory.
4561160	4567880	In grand unified field theory, this comes out. Okay. It's a consequence of a requirement in
4567880	4575880	quantum field theory that the fields belong to the same representation of the symmetry group.
4576600	4582120	But in quantum electrodynamics, the string confinement, there was no explanation.
4584760	4586120	When I was taking the course
4588680	4594440	from Schringer, I could have raised my hand and asked Schringer, why is the electron charge
4595080	4600360	equal, exactly equal in magnitude to the proton charge? Schringer would not have been able to
4600440	4608680	answer. Now, I mentioned this as a joke, because you know what would happen in Schringer's courses
4608680	4614440	if you raise your hand to ask a question. You were told beforehand by the other older students,
4614440	4619480	they're not supposed to raise your hand and ask questions. Schringer just would ignore
4620440	4626360	that. It is sort of a little bit like Dirac when Dirac was lecturing. You may run the risk of being
4626360	4634840	kicked out of the room if you have to ask a question. Okay. Now, let me ask, why is space
4634840	4641160	times three plus one dimensional? You know, always wonder about that when you started studying physics.
4643160	4648120	A quantum field theory is in this sense less intellectually complete than string theory.
4648840	4654520	String theory actually specializes the space time dimension. Now, quantum field theory,
4654520	4660840	of course, can be written in any space time dimension. It could be written in any,
4662440	4668760	nothing in quantum field theory fixes the dimension of space. Now, string theory, of course,
4669400	4676200	is much more restrictive. And as you all know, probably, that it could only be written in nine
4676200	4684360	plus one dimensional space time. So this is also a joke. String theory predicts that space
4684360	4691480	time has to be nine plus one dimension. And they have to scramble to compactify six of these
4692280	4699480	unseen dimensions. Okay, I'm going to wrap up. This is one of the last things I mentioned,
4699480	4706040	because I want some, perhaps some young people can solve this. To me, one of the greatest mysteries
4706040	4711720	in physics is that the dynamical evolution of quantum world is given by an exponential of the
4711720	4718360	Hamiltonian. And the Boltzmann factor in statistical physics also given by the exponential
4720200	4726600	of the Hamiltonian. So there's a connection between imaginary time and inverse temperature.
4727960	4734840	Is this just a coincidence or deeper? Over the years, I've asked a number of very famous
4734840	4741000	distinguished physicists this, and people seem to think that two different opinions, some people
4741000	4746840	think it's just a coincidence, and some people think it may have a deeper significance. I don't
4746840	4755160	know the answer. And I thought about it also. But be that as in May, it has some very useful
4756120	4762520	consequences. One very useful consequence is that it could be applied to calculating the
4762520	4768680	Hawking temperature of a black hole, basically almost in two lines. This is shown in my book.
4769240	4774920	But of course, I didn't invent that. I think that was invented by Gibbons and Hawking.
4776040	4784840	And you just analytically continue to this imaginary time, and you get the temperature.
4785720	4791400	I mentioned that this has some very useful consequences. I just mentioned one. I mentioned
4791400	4801320	another consequence, which is that for a long time, we had these fundraising events
4802520	4806120	in Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara is full of rich people, and you may have heard.
4807000	4815400	And so we're trying to get some of those rich people to give money. And the attitude is, of
4815400	4820360	course, I'm rich, so why should I give money to a bunch of theoretical physicists?
4821400	4827960	So I tell them, well, I'll tell you some very interesting, fascinating thing, that temperature,
4828600	4838200	you know, just imaginary time. And this always blows them away. So anyway, another useful consequence
4838200	4843720	is that partition function in statistical physics and in mind, many body physics could be represented
4843720	4849000	as Euclidean field theory in contrast to Minkowski field theory, because we have to continue,
4849560	4854920	right? It's imaginary time, so we continue instead of the Minkowski metric, we continue
4854920	4861320	to Euclidean metrics. And many other problems in physics can then be represented as quantum field
4861320	4866120	theory. So this just to show you that quantum field theory is very useful in many areas of physics.
4868040	4876680	So finally, I conclude by saying something that everybody in physics knows, everybody in theoretical
4876680	4884680	physics, there have been two great attempts at two great marriages. And the great marriage of
4884680	4891080	the 20th century was that quantum physics was married to special relativity. And as I emphasized
4891080	4897480	in the first transparency, this led to this very rich and marvelous subject called quantum field
4897480	4905880	theory, not Einstein, two daughters. One is called special relativity, the other is called general
4905960	4912040	relativity. And in the late 20th century, and now continuing into the early 21st century,
4913400	4919560	people are trying to marry quantum physics to general relativity. And we don't know what it
4919560	4925880	will reproduce, what it will produce. It would perhaps some people say string theory, but it
4925880	4931640	could be something else. It would be exciting if it's something that nobody has thought of
4932120	4937400	and waiting for, just waiting for a young person in the audience to discover.
4938600	4945240	So with that, I end my talk and thank you very much for inviting me to give the Maxwell lecture
4945240	4953320	at Cambridge University. Thank you. And thank you so much for coming here. There was a very
4953400	4965720	interesting talk and we have had so many questions. So let's see. So I guess it's a bit hard to hear
4965720	4974040	the applause, but I'm sure the chat will give it anyway. So the first question that we have
4974040	4980200	from the audience regards, you mentioned in the start of your talk regarding gravitons.
4980920	4987560	And they're asking, how likely do you think it is that gravitons actually exist?
4988280	4996680	Are there any experimental evidence for them? That's an extremely good question. Thank you.
4999560	5005720	Well, if we treat the gravitational field like any other field, as some people advocate,
5006680	5012920	then Einstein's theory is some action governing the behavior of this field, g mu nu,
5013640	5022280	and we expand g mu nu. Then it has a propagator as an interaction. It acts completely like a particle.
5023480	5033080	So I think from this point of view, many of us believe in graviton. Now, an opposite point of view
5034040	5042760	is propagated by Dyson, which I mentioned in my book on gravity, and which I'll mention in this
5042760	5049800	book I'm working on also. Dyson said, if you're going to ever measure the effect of a graviton,
5051960	5059240	so for example, in the analog of the photoelectric effect to see a graviton kicking out an electron
5059240	5066200	from a piece of metal, you can easily sit down and do the estimate. It'll be longer than the age
5066200	5075640	of the universe. And so it's clearly experimentally impossible to actually see a graviton. And so
5076280	5081240	Dyson said, I don't care about gravitons, and we should not talk about gravitons,
5081240	5086200	and we should not even quantize gravity. I mentioned that there was also a possibility
5086200	5092680	that some people do not want to quantize gravity. I'm not sure. So what I said in my book is that
5092680	5099720	I took the easy way out. I said on the weekends, I tend to believe Dyson, but the other days of the
5099720	5108600	week, I don't believe him. So I was very honored and privileged also to have seen Dyson in Princeton
5109480	5115960	a couple years before he passed away. And he is one of my favorite persons to talk to.
5116600	5123480	And I like the fact that he's very anti-establishment. So maybe gravitons don't exist, but we don't know.
5123480	5132200	We really don't know. I hope that answers your question. I think it's actually a mistake. I don't
5132200	5137720	agree with this fact that if you don't see it experimentally, there's no hope of experimentally
5137720	5143400	ever seeing it. Then it's not a useful thing to think about. In the 19th century, you know,
5143400	5147640	you can say the same thing. I mean, I think that was basically what people like Mark
5148520	5152600	were saying, that you cannot see atoms. So maybe you shouldn't talk about atoms.
5152600	5157160	You cannot see electrons. I don't like that philosophy.
5159240	5165560	To follow up a bit on then, what is, so where is it then that the problems come in with
5165560	5171080	quantum gravity? If we have this field of gravitons and we can describe it with the same
5173000	5179160	methods as we can, the electric field or the photon field, where do the problems arise?
5179160	5185400	Yes, yes, yes. Another very good question. Is this asked by the same person?
5185400	5188440	This is by me. This is just a short follow-up.
5188440	5194440	Yes, yes, that's also a very good question. So if you formulate,
5197320	5202840	you know, you quantize the gravitational field just by the usual method, and you have Feynman
5202840	5213240	diagrams. Okay, so you consider scattering two gravitons one on one with center mass energy
5213320	5220840	capital E. Then you soon see the next order correction get larger and larger as the energy
5220840	5225800	goes up. But the energy has to go all the way up to the Planck energy for this to happen.
5226440	5235240	So the perturbation series sort of doesn't make sense. So, but again, Professor Dyson,
5235640	5243800	you know, I was tempted to say Freeman, but somehow I'm really inhibited from saying that.
5243800	5255800	Professor Dyson would not like that at all. So that you shouldn't even, therefore,
5255800	5260120	Professor Dyson would say, well, you shouldn't even be scattering gravitons and gravitons in the
5260120	5267400	first place. But that's one way of seeing it. And you can certainly see that if you just quantize
5267400	5272680	the graviton in the usual way, you get into a lot of troubles. But what Dyson is saying,
5272680	5277960	that he says the quantum physics, quantum mechanics should not apply to the gravity.
5277960	5284280	But I find that view is probably inconsistent in my book. I talk about that also. You cannot say
5284280	5292280	that half of the world is quantum and the other half is not quantum. So I don't know. I really
5292280	5300360	don't know. Okay, it's one of the open questions, I guess, of physics. Then we have another question
5300360	5308520	which relates to, is there a possibility that there may exist fields we don't know about yet?
5308520	5314120	Is there a possibility that there are fields that we don't know anything about yet?
5314120	5314920	Yeah.
5314920	5321960	Of course. Dark energy may be represented by a field that we don't know anything about.
5322520	5327880	Although if you ask me to bet, I would bet the dark energy is just the cosmological constant.
5329400	5334200	We don't know what the dark matter is, but quite likely that matter is just
5335160	5341880	a particle described by a field. I published a paper on that a long time ago.
5343880	5351560	So I think that matter is just a scalar particle, a scalar field. It could be. We don't know. So
5351560	5359160	suddenly there may be fields we don't know anything about. So the experimentalists have to
5359240	5360360	sharpen the experiment.
5363640	5371240	Yeah. Okay. Then we have another question about expanding on quantum field theory,
5371240	5380040	in particular regarding loop quantum gravity. They're asking if loop quantum gravity is more
5380040	5381320	complete than QFT?
5386440	5392040	I'm not sufficiently of an expert on loop quantum gravity, so I don't want to say anything. I think
5392040	5400040	you should invite somebody from loop quantum gravity, like Ashtakar or somebody like that,
5400760	5406760	somebody reputable in loop quantum gravity. I think not everyone in loop quantum gravity is
5406760	5413080	reputable. According to some measure, of course, a subjective measure. But maybe somebody like
5413080	5422680	Ashtakar can answer that question. Okay. Thank you very much. Then we have one question regarding.
5423480	5430200	Quickly add to that. And this again, I'm not an expert on loop quantum gravity. This is only by
5430200	5442600	hearsay from my string theory friends. You know, one of the things quantum field theory is able
5442600	5451080	to calculate what the Hawking temperature is using field theory methods. But it cannot
5451960	5459240	understand, it cannot tell us where those hidden degrees of freedom come from. And I understand
5459320	5468040	that string theory could explain, could identify those degrees of freedom. This is the famous
5468040	5474040	calculation of Alfa and Strowman. But I heard from my string theory friends that the loop
5474040	5482840	gravity people cannot even reproduce that result. So I don't know. I just remember that. Okay. Thanks.
5482840	5493640	Okay. Thank you very much. Then we have a question about the the Yang-Noil mass gap.
5495160	5503160	We have if we have a question asking, what would solving it mean for physics? The millennium
5504920	5510920	always question. That is has to do with confinement. And so that's a detail of the strong
5510920	5517160	attraction. Now Gell-Mann proposed quarks. And quarks are never seen in the experimental
5517160	5525160	search board in the 1960s and so on so forth. So Gell-Mann proposed that quarks were permanently
5525160	5534760	confined. But that seems very plausible. But has never been proven. So that's one of the millennium
5534760	5541960	price problems which I encourage young people to work on is to prove confinement. And a simpler
5541960	5549000	version of confinement is just to prove that there's a mass gap in QED and QCD in quantum
5549000	5559880	chromodynamics. Okay. Then then thank you very much for that. Then we have another question
5562840	5573480	regarding regarding what's it called. If there is so you mentioned in the early section of your talk
5573480	5582280	regarding how spin can be used to predict whether a force is attractive or repulsive
5582280	5591720	between identical particles. And they're asking if there is a reason why spin zero attractions
5591720	5599880	like the strong force are much larger than spin two forces like gravity. Is there an underlying
5599880	5606520	reason for this or is it? Okay. That's a very good question. I think the free bonus of gravity
5607080	5613320	is not understood why gravity is the characteristic energy scale, the Planck energy,
5613880	5619080	is so much higher than anything we have explored. So this we also don't understand.
5621320	5627160	Here I can offer you a speculation. Okay. And this is just a wild speculation.
5628120	5633320	Why are humans so large compared to atoms and the fundamental particles?
5634040	5641960	And the reason is entropy, right? If we are made up of 20 atoms or something or a few hundred atoms,
5642920	5649320	we would be very unstable. I mean, entropic effects would fall apart and so on and so forth.
5649320	5657080	It's hard to imagine that we can do anything like reproduce ourselves and create physics and so
5657800	5663320	if we made us a thousand particles. So whether it's a big number comes from 10 to the 23.
5665160	5675560	And the reason is gravity is so feeble is also has to be related to the fact that we are so huge
5676760	5686760	because even if gravity is a lot stronger, gravity would be crushing us as well.
5687880	5694520	So I don't know. That's just a speculation. I mean, I'm not talking about gravity being
5694520	5701320	10 times stronger than it is now. Suppose the Planck mass instead of 10 to the 19 GV
5702600	5710200	is 10 to the 9 GV or something like this, 9 orders of magnitude. So gravity
5711000	5717400	would be 18 orders of magnitude stronger. I mean, we'll be crushed for sure, I think. So that may be
5717400	5730600	one speculation. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. Then I reckon we maybe have time for one more
5730600	5739720	question or should we say that's the final one? I'm fine answering a few more questions,
5740680	5749720	if you like. I mean, I will say we had at our peak, we had 400 people watching and now
5750760	5759720	actually it's gone down. We have slightly fewer now that the talk is nearing its end.
5760680	5762280	But they will be very, very active.
5764680	5771800	On YouTube, there will be a lot more views. I checked my talk in radio institutions
5771800	5778120	through a couple of months ago and a lot more views than that now. Anyway, I'm happy to answer a
5778120	5788680	few more questions. Yes. Let me see if I can find some good ones. So I guess there's a more
5789240	5797640	not necessarily related to the subject of physics, but rather related to studying physics.
5797640	5805000	There is a person asking if it's too late for someone to pursue physics at the age of 25
5805000	5812520	and whether it will still be possible to get into academic field our research when starting at that age.
5812520	5820920	I think this question is also a very good question. I'm asked for advice quite often.
5822280	5828440	This is a quite unusual question, but I think it's worth answering seriously.
5829640	5836600	I think that it's too complex for this question. One is institutional and societal or whatever
5836600	5843640	you want to call it institutional. That when you're a certain age, it's very difficult to get
5843640	5849720	into a good graduate school, et cetera, because places are limited and so on and so forth.
5853800	5859480	Getting into a graduate school, a good graduate school, is important. I think getting into a
5859480	5866040	good undergraduate school is not so important because quantum mechanics taught at Stanford
5866040	5870920	and quantum mechanics taught at Bundak University is the same quantum mechanics.
5872120	5878520	When you get into graduate school, you hear things from the great masters and so on and so forth.
5879560	5885000	So that's an institutional question. If you're 25, it may be hard to get into physics,
5885800	5893640	but on the other hand, the second part of the question is, of course, it depends on your ability.
5896840	5905320	If you have strong enough mental abilities, never too late, why 25 should be cut off age?
5905320	5915400	Why not 35 and even 45 and so on? I don't completely subscribe to this thing that
5915400	5922280	Dirac said that if you are 25 and you haven't done anything in theoretical physics,
5922280	5926360	you might as well go kill yourself or something. I think that's an awful thing to say.
5929000	5936680	There are many examples of people who pursue other things and switch into physics quite late,
5939080	5944360	people that were in engineering and so on. So it's certainly possible, but it of course all
5944360	5951880	depends on your ability. I mean, Ed Whitten, I was on the admissions committee that admitted him
5951880	5959000	to graduate school at Princeton and he was a very special case because his undergraduate major
5959000	5966680	or sociology and he had not taken a single physics course. So he was admitted to Princeton
5967320	5973720	and some of the other graduate students complained to me, even said that who is this guy? He's
5973720	5978920	taking the undergraduate quantum mechanics course and he doesn't even understand classical
5978920	5983480	mechanics. He's like asking us questions about Newton's, about classical mechanics.
5984280	5989800	But then at the end of the course, all the other students are going to him for help. So it depends
5989800	5996040	on your mental ability, obviously, rather than age. I mean, you can certainly find examples of people
5997640	6006840	that shown their brilliance later in life. So don't take what Dirac said seriously.
6009880	6022520	Okay. Thank you so much. And then I reckon, I guess this is, I'm going to take the opportunity
6022520	6033480	to ask a question of my own, actually, because I have that power. So when you were talking
6034280	6045000	a bit earlier on your slides about gauge fields and redundancy in description,
6045000	6053000	you mentioned something called twisters, that you mentioned that might be a way out of it.
6053000	6060280	What is a twister? Is that something that can be explained? Well, you are in England. You just
6060280	6068840	have to go those 83 miles. I remember it was 83 miles, right? You just have to move 83 miles,
6068840	6077000	go over to Oxford and ask Roger Penrose. He'll be happy to explain to you. Okay. But in a word,
6077640	6084920	read my quantum field theory book, the last part of my quantum field theory book, which is the stuff
6085000	6093480	I added after the first edition. There, modern-day people have done these calculations in QCD,
6094600	6102120	and for example, five gluon scattering. So in QCD, you have these gluons, Young-Mills particle,
6103480	6108840	two gluon scattering producing three. And I've forgotten how many, the exact number,
6108840	6113800	how many Feynman diagrams you have to use computers to calculate. And the result,
6114920	6121880	when printed in a journal page at the usual resolution, it's just a doc smudge. I think
6121880	6128840	I showed this doc smudge in my quantum field theory book. But this calculation using twisters
6129080	6142520	could be done in one line, basically. Okay. So there's a better, there's a more common word
6142520	6151240	for twisters these days. People call it electricity spinners. Some of the people doing electricity
6151240	6156440	spinners also told me that in the early days of the program, they don't want to call it twisters
6157400	6162920	because Roger has some other wild ideas and so on and so forth, as you guys all know.
6164200	6168840	And they don't want it to be confused with some of Roger's other ideas and so on and so forth.
6169720	6177960	So it's not called twisters now. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I'll have to go
6177960	6186840	to Oxford then. Yes, yes. Catch him before he goes to Stockholm. And when you see him,
6186840	6194520	you can thank him for, thank him for me. You said, for writing the preface to my book,
6194520	6198200	for writing the forward to my book, he wrote a very nice forward.
6198200	6203080	Other questions? Yeah.
6206200	6210120	Today is much higher level than the questions at the Royal Institution.
6211320	6216520	I mean, I guess we should thank the audience for that. They've all been brilliant and very,
6217720	6226120	and that's very, very interesting. Absolutely. I guess, I think we should probably wrap up at
6226120	6236760	this point, especially because there are many good questions still, but I don't think that most of
6236760	6247560	them can be answered in a short time. But thank you so much for the talk. And I mean, if we get
6247560	6254280	the opportunity, we would be happy to host you here some other time in Cambridge once this
6254280	6263880	pandemic ends. I should say to the people in the audience that, just as a reminder that we host
6263880	6273560	weekly talks, and we also have a talk next week by Paul Scheikin on using information
6273560	6282840	content to think about phases, which I hope many of you will attend. And in addition to that, we
6282840	6289080	also have, for the first year students at Cambridge, we have next week coming up a pub quiz
6289080	6298520	to help you get to know each other a bit better. And other than that, I think that's the end of
6298520	6304360	the stream. Thank you very much for the Archimedeans and have a good night.
