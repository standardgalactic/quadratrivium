 Maestro Genesis is an innovative software tool designed to assist both musicians and non-musicians in creating harmonies and accompaniments for any given MIDI file without requiring traditional musical expertise. Here's a summary of how to use the program to generate new musical compositions:

1. **Opening the Application:**
   - You start by selecting one of the three options from the start selection screen: Quick Start, Load File, or Load MIDI. For beginners, Quick Start is recommended as it provides pre-selected MIDIs to work with.

2. **Selecting a MIDI File:**
   - If you choose Load MIDI, you can select one of your own MIDI files to use as the basis for the accompaniment. You can select which tracks (up to three) Maestro Genesis will listen to and base the accompaniment on.

3. **Setting Up the Tracks:**
   - For rhythm, select the first track and enable the metronome icon.
   - For pitch, choose the second track and use the tuning fork icon.
   - If you want Maestro Genesis to consider both rhythm and pitch from a particular track, select that track with both icons.

4. **Listening and Selecting:**
   - Press the play button to hear all the tracks played together.
   - Use your judgment or intuition to decide which tracks to focus on based on their importance in the song.

5. **Generating Candidate Accompaniments:**
   - Once you've selected your pitch and rhythm tracks, click Done.
   - Maestro Genesis will generate a set of candidate accompaniments based on your selections.

6. **Evaluating and Selecting Candidates:**
   - Listen to the candidates by selecting one and pressing the play button.
   - If you like a particular candidate, save it using the floppy icon.
   - Use the Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down buttons to indicate your preference, as this will guide Maestro Genesis in generating accompaniments that suit your taste.

7. **Evolving the Accompaniment:**
   - To create a new generation of accompaniments, press the DNA (Evolve) button.
   - Maestro Genesis will generate ten new candidates, incorporating the aspects of the ones you liked.

8. **Fine-Tuning Changes:**
   - You can restrict changes to either rhythm or pitch by using the Settings menu and selecting to hold Rhythm Evolution or Pitch Evolution.

9. **Saving and Exporting:**
   - Once you are satisfied with the accompaniment, you can save it as a MIDI file or a special Maestro Genesis file for future use.

10. **Further Editing:**
    - Load the generated MIDI into a digital audio workstation (DAW) like Cubase or Finale to make manual adjustments if necessary.

Maestro Genesis is a powerful tool that can inspire new ideas, help overcome creative blocks, and enable anyone—musicians and non-musicians alike—to participate in the creation of music. By using Maestro Genesis, you can evolve melodies into complete works through an intuitive process that values your input and preferences.
