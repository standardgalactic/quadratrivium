00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Quick editor's note, the video you're about to watch

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,080
is based on info from these three videos.

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,040
One, where I slow down electricity

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,000
and show that it's linked to the speed of light.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,600
A second one, where I show that electricity

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,760
prefers to flow through connected wires

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,600
and not disconnected wires to solve the maze.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,960
And a third one, where I try to provide an intuition

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,520
for voltage current and resistance

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,080
using a lot of different analogies,

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,360
most notably a narrow trough of water.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,120
You don't need to have watched these videos

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,880
to see this one, but if you wanna learn more,

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,920
they exist.

15
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,960
Here, I have a very uninteresting circuit,

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,920
but it's gonna get a lot more interesting

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,720
when recorded at ridiculously high speed.

18
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,000
Over here, we have a battery.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,680
This is just a regular nine volt battery,

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,360
although this one's mostly dead.

21
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,960
And although it's not plugged in yet,

22
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,440
this is our power supply.

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,320
Over here on the left, we see that the wire splits in two.

24
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,360
The electricity from the battery could take this branch

25
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,720
where it would meet disconnected wires,

26
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,760
or it could take this branch

27
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,840
where I've soldered the wires together.

28
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,160
Cementry level electrical engineering tells us

29
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,520
that of course the electric current is going to flow

30
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,640
through the connected wires

31
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,840
and not flow through the disconnected wires.

32
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,640
That means we're actually going to have

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
a loop of electrons moving.

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,680
They're going to be heading away from the battery

35
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,600
in the black wire, rounding the corner at this solder joint,

36
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,200
and then heading towards the battery

37
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,640
everywhere in the red wire.

38
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,920
Over here, where the wires are disconnected,

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,520
there are still electrons in the wire,

40
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,780
but none of them should be moving

41
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,520
because they can't go anywhere.

42
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,160
The question I want to ask you is, how do they know?

43
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,240
Like, if I plug in this battery over here,

44
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,840
all of a sudden, electrons are going to start, you know,

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,600
chugging their way through this wire,

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,080
but we know from Ohm's law that the battery voltage

47
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,520
and the resistance of the wire

48
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,360
should cause a very specific number of electrons

49
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,520
to be flowing through this loop every second.

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,480
The instance I connect this battery,

51
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,120
the other end of the circuit is a meter away.

52
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,680
Information traveling at the speed of light

53
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,880
takes more than three nanoseconds to traverse this setup,

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,880
which means that when I plug in this battery

55
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,000
and the battery sort of asks the universe,

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,920
you know, how many electrons should I pump

57
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,760
into the black wire every second?

58
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,320
It takes more than six nanoseconds for it to get a reply.

59
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,080
So what do you think is going to happen?

60
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,240
Based on comments that I've gotten on other videos,

61
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,040
here are four possible answers.

62
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,160
Option A, the electric field has already solved the circuit.

63
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,080
As soon as the battery is connected,

64
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,680
the correct amount of current will flow

65
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,880
through the connected branch,

66
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,080
and no current will flow down the disconnected branch.

67
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,080
Option B, the electric field has already solved the circuit,

68
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,280
but it still has to update information

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,400
at the speed of light.

70
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,240
So as soon as you connect the battery,

71
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,680
the correct current starts to flow in the wires

72
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,520
in a sort of bubble that expands from the connection point.

73
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,160
Option C, the battery pumps an arbitrary amount

74
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,400
of current into the wire,

75
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,560
and despite one branch being disconnected,

76
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,160
the current that's flowing splits

77
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,840
when it gets to the fork and goes down both wires.

78
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,680
Although this is initially wrong,

79
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,600
it eventually stabilizes.

80
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,720
Option D, initially, nothing happens.

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,560
The battery updates the electric field at the speed of light,

82
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,320
and once information has returned

83
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,880
from the other end of the circuit,

84
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,920
the correct amount of current starts to flow

85
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,840
in the connected leg all at once.

86
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,520
In this video, we're actually going to be able to record

87
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,920
a circuit like this fast enough

88
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,120
to differentiate between these four options.

89
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,200
So think about it for a minute, make your guess,

90
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,960
and drop it in the comments while the title card plays.

91
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,680
Are you thinking about it?

92
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,680
I'm going to come back to this in more detail

93
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,920
at the end of the video,

94
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,640
but I wanted to give you something else to think about now.

95
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,280
This is the branching circuit replicated using my favorite,

96
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,560
the water channel model for electricity.

97
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,200
Do you think that electricity

98
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,240
is the only way to get rid of the water channel?

99
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,440
Well, I think that's the only way.

100
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm going to go back to this in more detail

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,120
at the end of the video,

102
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,560
but I wanted to give you something else to think about now.

103
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,080
I think that electrons in the wire

104
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,840
will do the same thing as the water in this mock-up,

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,880
despite the fact that flipping a switch

106
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
is a much more dynamic system

107
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
than the water model was meant to handle.

108
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,160
You're allowed to update your guess once more

109
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,600
before I show the real circuit in motion.

110
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,200
Unfortunately, observing electrons moving through wires

111
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,000
is obscenely difficult,

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,200
and I think that this is one of the reasons

113
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,520
that electricity is so hard to learn about.

114
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,720
I didn't properly understand the concept of line impedance,

115
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,720
for example, until I had built the apparatus

116
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,160
that I planned to use for this video

117
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,520
and used it to watch waves of electricity

118
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,120
traveling around in wires.

119
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,000
A regular camera, like the one on your phone,

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,200
can't see electron motion,

121
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,480
and even if it could,

122
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,880
the changes occur on the order of the speed of light.

123
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,040
For reference, this is a recent video from the Slow Mo Guys,

124
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,560
taken at 82,000 frames per second.

125
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,160
That sounds really fast,

126
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,200
but in between each frame of this video,

127
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,440
light can travel more than two miles, 3.5 kilometers.

128
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,000
Since electricity,

129
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,120
as in the signals and energy delivered by electric current,

130
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,440
travels anywhere between the speed of light

131
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,480
and maybe half the speed of light,

132
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,440
we clearly can't use a regular high-speed camera

133
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,400
to observe changes in a tabletop circuit model

134
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,080
that's only a few meters long.

135
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,160
In fact, we're going to need to cheat even more

136
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,160
with slower electricity and longer wires.

137
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm sorry for the really weird camera angle

138
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,840
for these shots,

139
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,960
but this literally takes up the entire room

140
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,560
and I can only set it up on the floor

141
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,040
unless I set it up outside.

142
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,360
So this is what we've got.

143
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,000
I did try a whole bunch of methods

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,440
to create extra slow transmission lines,

145
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,880
but I ended up with this homemade twisted pair

146
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,480
in which electricity travels at about 60%

147
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,400
the speed of light.

148
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,960
But since that's still too fast,

149
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,440
I made a lot of this twisted pair,

150
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,640
and I ended up zigzagging it onto these wooden frames,

151
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,680
each of which holds about 23 meters of cable.

152
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,400
I'll get to some of that decision-making later,

153
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,360
like why I have this twisted pair

154
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,680
and why my scope probes look like this.

155
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,440
But for now, we have a larger and slower version

156
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,060
of the circuit from the intro.

157
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,160
At the top here, at the start of the circuit,

158
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,360
we literally just have a nine-volt battery,

159
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,960
and that nine-volt battery gets plugged into this circuit,

160
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,620
which is an electronic switch,

161
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,880
which is basically just able to plug the battery in

162
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,960
faster than I would be able to.

163
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,800
After that, it goes into this cable, this twisted pair,

164
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,360
which goes zigzagging, zigzagging, zigzagging

165
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,880
for 23 meters into this Y,

166
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,560
where we have three cables connected,

167
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,440
and then it goes zigzagging, zigzagging over here

168
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,520
to an open circuit where the two wires are disconnected,

169
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,000
and it goes zigzagging, zigzagging, zigzagging to here

170
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,920
where the wires are connected,

171
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,520
which means that after this battery is plugged in,

172
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,400
we should have electric current flowing through these wires

173
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,480
and electric current flowing through these wires

174
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,960
where they're shorted together.

175
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,160
But we should not have any electricity flowing over here

176
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,560
where the wires are disconnected.

177
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,920
These are basically just attached,

178
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,400
but they don't really do anything.

179
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,360
Now, the round trip time at the speed of electricity

180
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,160
is about 500 nanoseconds.

181
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,560
When I plug in this battery,

182
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,240
or when this circuit plugs in this battery

183
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
really, really quickly,

184
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,860
it takes about 500 nanoseconds for that information

185
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,200
to make it all the way to both ends of the cable

186
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,320
and come back.

187
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,640
That's slow enough that we should actually

188
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,800
be able to measure it.

189
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,680
The most common tool for analyzing very fast changes

190
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,160
in electronic circuits is called an oscilloscope.

191
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,040
I have one right here.

192
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,320
We're gonna use it in a minute.

193
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,480
But in general, I find oscilloscopes

194
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,240
and analysis of circuits with oscilloscopes

195
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,640
to be very, very limiting.

196
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,360
An oscilloscope is basically a voltmeter

197
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,560
combined with a really accurate clock,

198
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
and it will draw you a plot

199
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,300
of how the voltage on a wire changes over time.

200
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,120
For example, what if I wanted to know

201
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,240
exactly how fast this switch is?

202
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,840
When you plug in the battery,

203
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
how quickly does the voltage on the wire

204
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
go from zero to maximum?

205
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,360
So on this plot, the x-axis is time,

206
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,760
and the y-axis is voltage.

207
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,200
So when we plug in the battery,

208
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,440
we can see that the voltage goes from zero to high

209
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,920
in a very, very short span of time.

210
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,100
This whole event takes less than 10 nanoseconds.

211
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,160
This is a really fast switch.

212
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,360
In this particular case, it gets a little weirder,

213
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,320
because when we zoom out,

214
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,280
we can see there's a little bit of a step right here,

215
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,280
and then there's another step right here,

216
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,520
and I mean, this is just sort of bizarre.

217
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,000
Like there's a dip right there before it stabilizes,

218
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,520
like what's actually going on?

219
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,880
If you wanna play this back as an animation,

220
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,400
we can imagine flipping this switch

221
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,240
at an absurdly fast rate.

222
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,360
The voltage at this point in the circuit spikes up,

223
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,240
and then mystery stuff happens in the rest of the circuit,

224
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,640
and then the voltage over here steps down a little bit,

225
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,440
and then more mystery stuff happens

226
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,520
in the rest of the circuit,

227
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,880
and then the voltage steps down and ends up stabilizing.

228
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,800
This is why I find oscilloscope traces so limiting.

229
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,520
You can see what's happening at one location,

230
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,440
but you can't really see everything.

231
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,280
The trick that we can use is to probe more points

232
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,020
on the circuit at once.

233
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,960
If I take an extra set of scope probes,

234
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,440
and I attach them in the middle,

235
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,400
now we see something very interesting.

236
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,320
The voltage at this point in the circuit

237
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,040
doesn't rise until 116 nanoseconds later.

238
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,720
If I measure the voltage at this point

239
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,360
at the end where the wires are connected together,

240
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,760
we basically see, oh man, it's very noisy.

241
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,600
Hot, hot.

242
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,040
Let's melt my fingers together, that'll help.

243
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,120
If I measure the voltage at the end of the circuit

244
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,920
that's shorted out where the wires are just soldered together,

245
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,720
we can see on the scope that the voltage

246
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,000
basically stays flat the whole time,

247
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,080
but now requiring me to be completely under the table,

248
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,880
if we measure the voltage over here,

249
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,880
if we wait about 240 nanoseconds,

250
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,960
then we see the voltage at this point

251
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,920
all the way at the end of the wire start to go up.

252
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,040
So let's run that same visualization again.

253
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,640
When we flip this switch,

254
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,680
we see the voltage at the switch go up,

255
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,920
and then something happens probably in the first panel,

256
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,260
and then we see the voltage go up in the middle,

257
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,040
and then something happens probably in both panels,

258
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,360
and then we see something happen in the panel

259
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,740
with the disconnected wires,

260
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,580
which was the panel

261
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,020
where we didn't expect to see anything happening.

262
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,620
Then we just start to see voltages

263
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,940
changing all over the circuit.

264
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,380
It's not super clear what's going on.

265
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,460
This is why I get frustrated with the oscilloscopes

266
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,820
as a learning tool sometimes,

267
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,300
because you can't see the propagation.

268
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,740
So with a couple extremely tedious hours

269
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,820
of stripping wires with an X-Acto knife,

270
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,820
I added taps every four feet

271
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,660
so that I could attach probes all over the place

272
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,860
and play them back at the same time.

273
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,020
This ends us with something that looks like this.

274
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,580
["Pomp and Circumstance"]

275
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,300
If I show it in a more graphy view here,

276
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,340
maybe some of these features get clearer.

277
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,700
I really love this footage,

278
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,940
and it shows that no, the battery has no idea

279
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,300
how much current should flow when you plug it in.

280
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,740
The battery is connected.

281
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,380
A whole bunch of current flows down the wire.

282
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,900
When it hits the Y, the current gets split,

283
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,500
but also something looks like it reflects

284
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,820
back towards the battery.

285
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,980
That's kind of weird.

286
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,180
And now we have a pulse,

287
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,540
actually two identical pulses

288
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,740
traveling down both far wires.

289
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,980
Remember, this wire has the ends disconnected,

290
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,340
and this wire has the ends soldered together.

291
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,940
When the two identical pulses

292
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,140
reach the end of their respective wires,

293
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,140
the one that meets the disconnected circuit

294
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,580
slams into a wall.

295
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,420
All of that current sloshes back and piles up.

296
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,580
The other pulse gets shorted out, drops to zero,

297
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,660
and also sends that information back towards the battery.

298
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,700
If I speed up here, we see over a few reflections.

299
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,660
The battery realizes it tried to send

300
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,540
way too much power the first time,

301
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,140
and slowly the whole circuit settles down.

302
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,740
Current, the actual flow of electrons,

303
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,460
ends up following this slope

304
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,100
as the high voltage at the battery

305
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,740
drops to nothing at the short.

306
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,180
And in the disconnected wire,

307
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,740
where nothing should be happening,

308
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,060
there isn't a slope,

309
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,300
no voltage to make electrons move.

310
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,420
Until the waves actually get to the ends of the wire,

311
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,940
they look identical.

312
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,460
Because these waves of current don't know

313
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,700
what is at the end of their respective branches

314
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,540
of the circuit.

315
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,980
Once they realize what's at the end of their circuit,

316
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,500
they transmit that information back to the battery.

317
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,540
This branch says, whoa, I need a bit less current this way.

318
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,620
It looks like a wall.

319
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,180
And this one says, hey, I need more current.

320
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,980
Make this hill a little bit steeper.

321
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,580
When both these signals meet each other

322
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,380
and eventually get back to the battery,

323
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,700
there's a negotiation.

324
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,780
And it requires a lot of back and forth communication.

325
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,340
In this case, the whole circuit took

326
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,100
about 4,000 nanoseconds to stabilize.

327
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,140
That's like eight round trips.

328
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,060
I also wanna point out that these wires

329
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,100
can't talk to each other through this gap.

330
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,140
I just wanted to make it easy to compare the waves

331
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,620
by putting them side by side.

332
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,660
So for those of you keeping score at home,

333
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,020
the answer is C.

334
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,340
It takes much longer than one round trip for electricity,

335
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,700
for the current to stabilize,

336
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,620
and for the circuit to obey Olm's law in DC.

337
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,340
But that leaves us with a few more questions.

338
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,580
Like what are these waves that are traveling

339
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,620
through this circuit?

340
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,540
And how does the battery and switch assembly here

341
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,500
decide how much current should initially flow in the wire

342
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,300
if it's just guessing and it doesn't know

343
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,620
how much current should flow to either end?

344
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:13,660
To answer those questions,

345
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,380
I have a similar but simpler circuit set up here.

346
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,440
Instead of a big branching circuit

347
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,300
with lots and lots of wire, this is just a straight shot.

348
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,180
So I have the same very fast electronic switch

349
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,780
that plugs the battery into the wire.

350
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,620
And then I have 23 meters of my custom twisted pair.

351
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,300
And at the end, two wires that are dangling free

352
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,060
so that I can attach whatever resistor I want

353
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,220
as a load on the end of this circuit.

354
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,740
That basically means that we have a power supply

355
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,800
and we have a load that are separated

356
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,020
by hundreds of nanoseconds of delay time.

357
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,980
It's really easy to go in here and say,

358
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,260
I know the resistance of the wire,

359
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,500
I know the resistance of the load,

360
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,940
I know the resistance that's built into the power supply.

361
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,540
And you can calculate how much current,

362
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,420
literally how many electrons per second

363
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,820
are going to be chugging their way through this wire.

364
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,500
But as we just saw, the correct number of electrons

365
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,340
don't flow the first time you hit the switch.

366
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,820
They sort of have to bounce around and figure it out.

367
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,700
For the first test, I'm just going to short out the end.

368
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,540
I've soldered these two wires together.

369
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,660
So this big long chain is terminated

370
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,300
in a zero ohm resistor.

371
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,500
I spent what ended up being quite a while

372
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,380
writing a script that brings in these voltage traces

373
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,700
and produces an exaggerated view

374
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,300
of how the electrons actually move in the wire.

375
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,580
So I want to be very clear,

376
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,180
this top plot is real data that I actually collected.

377
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,500
This is 20 individual oscilloscope traces

378
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,780
that are all being played back at the same time.

379
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,740
And this is a heavily exaggerated animation

380
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,100
of the electrons motion based on that data.

381
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,420
And then this final plot is a realistic,

382
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,740
albeit extremely noisy graph of electron drift velocity

383
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,860
along the wires length that we'll talk about in a minute,

384
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,700
but it's also based on the raw data.

385
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,900
For now, let's cover most of this up.

386
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,620
The fundamental point in here is the speed of electricity

387
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,380
and the speed of the electrons.

388
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,220
And those are not the same thing.

389
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,340
If we look at this wave traveling down the wire,

390
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,660
we see that it travels this 23 meters

391
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,980
in about 120 nanoseconds,

392
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,020
which means it's traveling at almost 200,000 kilometers

393
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,100
per second, which is like two thirds the speed of light.

394
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,340
That is absurdly fast.

395
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,460
However, if we look at these electrons

396
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,420
that have started moving, they go a whole lot slower.

397
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,440
In the graphic, the individual electrons

398
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,020
are moving about 10 times slower than the wave.

399
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,380
And that right there is the exaggeration

400
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,080
because in reality, the electrons in this wire

401
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,420
are traveling about 10 trillion times slower

402
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,420
than the wave.

403
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,020
But that doesn't make for a very understandable graphic.

404
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,580
But if they were drawn out accurately,

405
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,580
you'd never be able to see that they were scrunched

406
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,780
in some places and more spread out in other places

407
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,260
because the spacing just doesn't change very much.

408
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,100
That said, it is the scrunching and spreading out

409
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,020
of electrons in different parts of wires

410
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,220
that causes electrons to do what they do

411
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,660
and to flow through wires.

412
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,860
If we look at the wires,

413
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,020
these are the two wires of the twisted pair,

414
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,060
although the twist really doesn't matter.

415
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,820
When we flip the switch and this wave travels down the wire,

416
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,100
we see that the electrons are pulled from one wire

417
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,580
and shoved into the other.

418
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,660
But at the end, the electrons haven't started moving yet.

419
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,660
Any given point on this trace at the top

420
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,740
is the voltage or potential difference

421
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,100
between the wires of the twisted pair below.

422
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,780
When this voltage goes up here, but is still zero over here,

423
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,540
we're saying that in this region,

424
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,340
there are more electrons in the wire than this wire.

425
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,600
But at the far end, there are just as many electrons

426
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,560
in both wires.

427
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,420
Of course, this is about to change.

428
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,840
As this wave reaches the end of the wire,

429
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,600
all these electrons start moving.

430
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,400
So in answer to our first question,

431
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,000
what are these waves?

432
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,560
These waves are waves of motion

433
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,280
and waves of electron bunching and scrunching.

434
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,000
At one instant, if there are electrons moving to the right

435
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,360
in this part of the wire and not moving

436
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,000
in this other part of the wire,

437
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,940
the only way that can be happening

438
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,320
is if the electrons in between those two regions

439
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,360
in this part of the wire are actually getting closer together.

440
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,160
And if we play this footage forwards,

441
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,860
that's exactly what we see.

442
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,860
It's a common argument in my comment section

443
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,700
that these waves of electricity are just the electric field

444
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,000
and that the electrons don't really move.

445
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,300
But if that were the case,

446
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,460
this zigzag layout wouldn't work.

447
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,660
The electric field would cover the whole panel

448
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,540
faster than I'd be able to measure it.

449
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,500
These phenomena only make sense

450
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,220
if electrons are actually scooching down the wire

451
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,460
and bunching up, even if ever so slightly.

452
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,340
That's why electricity follows wires and cables.

453
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,540
It can only go where the electrons can scooch forwards.

454
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,740
I originally had this circuit set up

455
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,540
where the wires at the end were shorted together.

456
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,420
So it was basically like a zero ohm resistor.

457
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,460
But now,

458
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,780
I've cut them apart.

459
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,740
So there's an infinity ohm resistor right here

460
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,660
where the two wires are just hanging free.

461
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,260
So what do you think is going to happen in this case?

462
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,420
There's no way for electrons to flow down the black wire

463
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,900
all the way down to the end,

464
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,260
somehow magically jump this gap

465
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,340
and flow back along the red wire.

466
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,340
But we know that when we flip this switch,

467
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,420
we're going to have current.

468
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,020
Electrons are going to start moving

469
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,860
in this part of the wire the moment we flip this switch.

470
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,580
So what's that going to look like

471
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,540
when it gets to the end?

472
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,860
It's going to look like this.

473
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,200
After we flip the switch,

474
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,260
we get the exact same step,

475
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,220
the same wave of electricity

476
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,260
at about two and a quarter volts of potential

477
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,980
and about 15 milliamps of current

478
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,860
are flowing in that part of the wire.

479
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,940
But when that wave gets to the end,

480
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,340
it can't go anywhere.

481
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,180
Basically these electrons slam into the end of the wire

482
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,500
and pile up.

483
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,100
Now we have a big steep slope of voltage

484
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,780
in the other direction.

485
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,200
If the first slope accelerated electrons towards the load,

486
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,140
this reverse slope decelerates the electrons

487
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,360
and awesomely the magnitudes match.

488
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,620
So all the electrons start moving,

489
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,060
then the reflected wave perfectly cancels them out

490
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,800
and they all stop moving.

491
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,100
Of course it does bounce back and forth a bit more

492
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,460
but after all that,

493
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,980
we end up with two wires full of unmoving electrons.

494
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,020
The fact that at the end of this animation,

495
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,700
this extremely data driven animation,

496
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,860
all of the electrons stop moving,

497
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,300
like makes me so happy.

498
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,020
The fact that the wave going one way

499
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,420
is perfectly canceled by the wave going the other way

500
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,620
when it hits the end of this is so cool.

501
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,780
And that can be measured accurately enough

502
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,340
to make an animation like this with an oscilloscope

503
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,020
that's only a few hundred bucks.

504
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,700
Just, I was so excited when I saw this animation

505
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,540
for the first time.

506
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,700
But both wires are at different potentials.

507
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,700
There's a voltage difference between them.

508
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,140
If you wanna get technical,

509
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,500
we're now seeing the wires capacitance

510
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,380
measured in charge per volt.

511
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,460
Physically, how many charged electrons

512
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,300
we need to add to a wire to change its voltage?

513
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,200
This also in a roundabout way,

514
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,020
answers our second question.

515
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,380
In both cases, the exact same wave left from the battery

516
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,700
because the circuit at this end

517
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,700
didn't yet know what was at this end.

518
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,780
And the magnitude of this wave was largely controlled

519
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,740
by the capacitance of the wire.

520
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,620
How many electrons can be crammed into this wire

521
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,660
when you apply a certain voltage?

522
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,420
Or to be linguistic about it,

523
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,580
the wire's capacity to hold extra electrons.

524
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,260
This value is very high for instances like this

525
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,900
where you have nearby wires wrapped in insulation

526
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,460
and extremely low for wires that are far apart

527
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,860
with nothing in between.

528
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,940
So now let's go back to the Y-shaped circuit

529
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,480
and hopefully you'll see all these effects present

530
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,740
in a much more complicated model.

531
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,540
So now we understand this first bit.

532
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,040
When we send a pulse of voltage down the wire,

533
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,380
at the ends of the branches, the electrons aren't moving yet.

534
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,380
But everywhere this wave has been,

535
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,660
electrons have started moving.

536
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,260
And at the edge of the wave,

537
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,940
the electrons are either clumping up or spreading out.

538
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,380
Now, when this pulse hits the fork, three things happen.

539
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,020
Part of the wave reflects back,

540
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,460
part of the wave continues into the connected branch,

541
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,140
and part of the wave continues

542
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,060
into the disconnected branch.

543
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,860
These waves continue until they hit their respective loads,

544
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,140
a dead short or zero ohm resistor,

545
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,820
and an open circuit or infinity ohm resistor.

546
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,620
Just like in the single cable test,

547
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,980
we see the electrons that hit the open circuit

548
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,100
pile up and reflect back, stopping all motion.

549
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,380
And in the other branch, the wave reflects back low,

550
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,020
actually accelerating the electrons in the wire further.

551
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,300
This branching circuit is a dramatically

552
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,580
more complicated system

553
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,220
than the single cable terminated in a resistor.

554
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,180
But hopefully you can see the same patterns in both.

555
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,500
We can continue tracing individual reflections and waves

556
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,260
and interactions between electrons in all of these wires

557
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,700
and carefully predicting what will happen next.

558
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,980
Or we can just fast forward to the end

559
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,660
and see that all of this hardly matters

560
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,140
because after a few hundred nanoseconds,

561
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,580
everything settles out and we get exactly what we expect.

562
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,520
A descending gradient from power supply to load

563
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,300
where the DC version of ohm's law

564
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,420
is satisfied for all locations.

565
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,380
This is the same net result I measured

566
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,220
in the electricity maze video, but at that scale,

567
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,100
I wasn't able to record it fast enough

568
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,740
to show you how it got that way.

569
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,180
Hopefully now it makes a little more sense

570
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,940
and you can imagine these waves sort of percolating

571
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,260
through every possible way to solve that maze at once

572
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,020
before the circuit settled into that result.

573
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,060
At the start, I mentioned the water channel model

574
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,180
was going to make a comeback

575
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,940
and I wanna show you what parts

576
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,180
of the water channel model are applicable

577
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,900
and where you have to be careful.

578
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,420
And then somewhere we got one down there.

579
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,460
Is it only three leaks?

580
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,180
It's pretty great.

581
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,180
I recreated this circuit as best I could

582
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,340
with acrylic sheet water channels

583
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,740
and used large basins of water as a supply and a load.

584
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,020
So effectively we have two capacitors connected to ground,

585
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,700
a switch and an extra bit of wire.

586
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,740
So check out these shots side by side.

587
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,900
In both cases, the wave leaves from the supply,

588
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,620
travels down the first leg, splits at the branch,

589
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,060
sloshes up at the dead end

590
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,740
and sloshes down at the open end.

591
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,520
The fact that this water channel model

592
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,520
is able to so accurately depict the dynamics of electricity,

593
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,940
a completely different system

594
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,380
and one that operates on time scales

595
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,220
that are orders of magnitude faster than water.

596
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,540
It's just really amazing to me, but it's not perfect.

597
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,140
Weirdly in the water version,

598
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,420
the back reflections aren't as pronounced.

599
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,340
When the signals hit the loads at the end,

600
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,740
we absolutely see one wave pile up

601
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,140
and the other drop low.

602
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,060
But in general, the dynamics of water

603
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,260
are a little more direct

604
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,620
and the signals returning to the power supply

605
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,820
aren't as obvious.

606
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,100
One reason for this may be that the parameters

607
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,580
of the circuits don't match.

608
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,580
If I repeat the electricity experiment

609
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,580
with higher resistance wire, not impedance but resistance,

610
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,620
we get a slightly closer analog

611
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,540
where the reflections of electricity

612
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,980
are significantly diminished.

613
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,580
But while water in a narrow channel

614
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,160
and electrons in a wire do show a lot of similarities,

615
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,040
like seriously, I can keep listing them for 40 minutes,

616
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,400
inertia is something that's really finicky.

617
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,040
If you look at this model from above,

618
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,880
you can see that it's not symmetrical

619
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,600
and neither is it straight.

620
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,200
The way that water maintains inertia around corners

621
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,240
is extremely different from electrons,

622
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,520
which pick up an effective inertia while drifting

623
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,040
by creating a magnetic field around the wire.

624
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,560
This divot, for example,

625
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,960
would never appear in electron flow in a wire.

626
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,080
And at the end, I wasn't able to create

627
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,200
a perfect low voltage supply to pull the signal down,

628
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,640
but this is something that's really easy in wires.

629
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,280
I always imagine circuits, even dynamic ones with waves,

630
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,560
like water flowing through these channels.

631
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,960
But sometimes the mental image

632
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,280
with the idealized water flowing down

633
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,000
an idealized water trough is a better analog to electricity

634
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,920
than building one in real life and filming it in real life.

635
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,360
However, even this real one with all of its imperfections

636
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,680
is an excellent qualitative model

637
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,040
that I think provides a lot of intuition

638
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,480
for an otherwise very difficult topic.

639
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,840
Of course, what actually happens in my head

640
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,760
is that when this doesn't match,

641
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,720
I start thinking of a more complicated electronic circuit

642
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,320
that would match this better.

643
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,080
Like this milk jug at the end is basically a capacitor

644
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,560
and the fact that I've cut it off

645
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,960
makes it a voltage regulator.

646
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,600
And it's a lot better than basically what I had before

647
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,040
was like a voltage sensitive resistor

648
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,520
where I just ended it.

649
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,360
Anyway, I hope that you learned something

650
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,200
about electricity watching this video.

651
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,360
I certainly learned a lot about electricity

652
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,880
making this video and had a lot of fun

653
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,160
trying to figure out how to film electricity

654
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,600
at a ridiculous speed

655
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,400
and making the equivalent water model to think about.

656
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,560
I feel like I'm completely incapable

657
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,320
of writing a short script anymore.

658
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,520
There was an awful lot that got cut from this video,

659
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,200
especially a more mathematical view of this circuit

660
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,760
and how you can actually calculate

661
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,200
the strengths of these waves

662
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,000
and a lot more with the single cable

663
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,960
that was terminated with various resistors.

664
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,040
So that all ended up becoming another video.

665
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,360
You should head over to Alpha Phoenix 2

666
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,000
where I have the Q and A from my previous mainline video

667
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
posted along with another few short videos

668
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,400
that I think you'll enjoy.

669
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,320
Thanks for watching.

670
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,240
See you next time.

671
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,800
Bye.
