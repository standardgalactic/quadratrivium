0	22640	All right, so hey there everybody. I am back in the microscopy suite in the
22640	27680	materials department at UCSB and I'm going to show you some atoms. So this
27680	34480	huge like car-sized box and these four monitors, the huge cylinder behind those
34480	38280	four monitors and some more equipment that's behind that back wall, together
38280	42680	constitute an instrument called a scanning transmission electron microscope or
42680	47640	stem. And today I'm going to show you exactly how this works. So my last
47640	52240	microscopy video was making a play button, which was kind of a joke, but
52240	56520	today I'm going to be doing some real research. I'm going to be looking for a
56520	61160	specific defect in a crystalline material called tin selenide, and I'm not
61160	64800	sure that I'm going to be able to find it, but either way I'll learn something. So
64800	68080	this is going to be like real research happening right before your eyes on
68080	70640	YouTube today.
79040	84680	Now in order to actually blast electrons all the way through a sample of
84680	91040	material in order to image its atoms, that sample needs to be really really
91040	97600	really thin. Imagine you know shining a piece of light through a piece of light
97600	101760	trying to shine a light through a piece of paper. You can see some light through
101760	105840	a piece of paper, but now imagine trying to shine a light through a piece of
105840	110560	plywood. It's just not going to work. So they're both the same thing, they're both
110600	116080	cellulose, but one is a lot thicker and a lot denser. So when you're trying to
116080	120200	make a transmission sample that you can shoot electrons all the way through, it
120200	125280	needs to more resemble a sheet of paper, except a bunch of orders of magnitude
125280	129640	thinner. I didn't actually film the sample preparation, but if you remember
129640	134040	the focused ion beam from one of my previous videos, that's the machine that
134040	140520	you use to create these unreasonably impossibly thin samples. For reference,
140520	145800	the sample I'm about to look at here is mounted on this tiny flake of copper, but
145800	150080	to see it, we're going to have to zoom in. On this flake of copper, there is
150080	154720	actually a crescent shape, and in the crescent shape there are a few metal
154720	159960	posts. If you zoom in on one of those posts, you can see a bump on the side.
159960	165280	That's my sample. Looking even closer, hopefully you can appreciate how this
165280	170720	entire sample is a vanishingly thin flag of material. It's about six
170720	177520	micrometers tall, 14 micrometers long, and between 50 and 100 nanometers thin at
177520	182200	the spot where I'll be imaging. Somewhere in the range of about 150 atoms
182200	187280	thick, and this is what we'll be shooting electrons through to cast our shadows.
187280	193000	Even though this copper crescent is like vaguely 100,000 times larger than the
193040	197040	dimension we care about on the sample it's holding, it's still small enough that
197040	200880	it's a pain to work with. So to help, we've got these fancy vacuum tweezers.
200880	205280	Basically a tiny hose that sucks up the sample like a piece of cardboard stuck to
205280	209680	a shop vac. This is more than a little finicky, and while trying to bend around
209680	214000	to give the camera a good view, I actually dropped it the first time.
214000	221160	Ah, crud. Something like this could only happen when I tried to film it.
221520	225360	Thankfully the sample itself was all right. It's also worth appreciating that
225360	231080	even this tiny sample stage is itself a miniature engineering marvel. It's
231080	235560	designed to tilt the sample in two directions without translating it in
235560	240680	X, Y, or Z by more than a couple microns. It's absurdly precise. This is actually
240680	244560	some microscope footage from a time that the holder actually broke. I swear I was
244560	248240	not pushing on the clip any harder than I should have been. But you can see that
248240	252200	the hinge here that broke isn't a normal ball bearing or something like that.
252200	257520	It's actually a ruby, like literally a polished gemstone that runs in a groove.
257520	262520	So now that the sample is mounted inside of this chuck, if you'll follow me around
262520	269200	the corner, in here we have the actual microscope. Like all electron microscopes,
269200	273960	the stem here is basically just a big multi-compartment vacuum chamber, which
273960	277000	means that this thing, when I load it into the chamber, needs to be able to
277000	280640	stop all of the air from rushing in behind it. When I put this in, it's
280640	283680	actually going to create a seal at this O-ring, and then I'm going to have to
283680	286600	wait for a few minutes while it pumps out the air lock before I can push it
286600	289800	all the way into the microscope.
289800	308640	There we go. That was the pump start. And don't worry, if I made trying to load that
308640	312400	sample look awfully tedious, just wait till I get to the part where I focus the
312400	317200	microscope for an hour. Just like that. Air pressure pushes it right on in. I don't
317240	325480	even have to do anything. A transmission electron microscope is basically casting
325480	330320	shadows with a beam of electrons. You're shooting a high-energy beam of
330320	335200	electrons all the way through a material, and you're projecting whatever gets
335200	341400	through out onto a screen and looking at that image. Now because it is so much
341400	346320	easier to visualize this when you don't use electrons, I'm going to be doing a
346320	351680	demonstration with photons. If I have a point source of light, like this flashlight
351680	355280	with a piece of poster board with a pinhole in it, any shape that I put in
355280	360960	front of the light casts a shadow on this screen. And critically, the shadow is
360960	365960	actually magnified based on the relative distances between the source, object, and
365960	375520	screen. Huge wrench. Small wrench. Big wrench. Small wrench. I need to get out more.
375720	380760	But if you notice, the edges of this shadow are a little bit fuzzy. If we try to look at
380760	385280	something really tiny, let's say these ball bearings are like atoms being
385280	389880	imaged in a microscope, this method doesn't really let us see anything. One of
389880	394680	the multiple problems here is that the pinhole isn't actually a very good point
394680	399040	source. It's almost the same size as the features that we're trying to image. So
399040	402720	light from one edge of the pinhole and light from the other edge of the pinhole
402760	409160	actually cast very slightly different overlapping shadows. And in order to
409160	413960	accurately image the atoms then, all our electrons would need to originate from a
413960	419320	point in space that's smaller than an atom. And we can't do that. If we're
419320	424800	slightly more clever, we can use lenses to project a sharp image, even with a
424800	429800	less-than-perfect source of light. Here I've set a lens so that as light exits
429880	435040	this pinhole, it's actually made into a nearly parallel beam. That parallel beam
435040	439520	passes through the ball bearings and a shadow is created. And then we can take
439520	444360	that beam and if everything is lined up just right, blow it up to project a
444360	449360	larger shadow on the screen. Once we send it through here, it gets smaller,
449360	457040	comes down to a point and then blows up and expands out here. So we have a
457640	463160	magnified image on the screen. Remarkably sharp. Much, much better than I thought
463160	467440	I'd get with this. Those are our atoms. Just imagine that instead of a flashlight
467440	472320	with a pinhole, we have an electron gun powered by a huge high-voltage power
472320	477360	supply and instead of glass lenses, we have really big electromagnets that
477360	481160	bend that beam of electrons as it's passing through the microscope. Now
481160	485360	compared to our flashlight model, the electron gun is at the top of this
485360	490600	system and it's focused by a series of magnetic lenses capable of bending the
490600	495040	electron beam onto the sample and then through the sample and then through more
495040	499560	lenses that expand that image into a camera. Now when we turn this whole
499560	504400	shebang on, we literally just get a shadow image of the copper crescent. Pretty
504400	508800	cool, right? Yeah, so here you can really see that the the place where there is
508800	513160	nothing like this, you know, you can just see bright because that's where the
513200	518200	electrons are hitting uninhibited. This thing is the big chunk of copper that
518200	523040	the electrons can't get through so it looks black and this is the sample which
523040	527560	is so thin that it's electron transparent and it actually sort of looks
527560	532360	gray because it'll let some electrons through which is kind of the point. You
532360	536320	can see huge bits of strain and bending in the sample as it's sort of warping
536320	540240	around. It's really interesting. Right now what we need to do is basically get
540240	543720	the beam pointed at the sample and get the sample pointed at the beam. Getting
543720	547280	the beam pointed at the sample sounds pretty straightforward but getting the
547280	551880	sample pointed at the beam, that's a weirder phrase. You need to remember that
551880	557960	we're dealing with a crystal, this perfect 3d grid of atoms in space. Now
557960	562360	earlier I used the ball bearings to emulate a single layer of atoms but what
562360	569240	if I had two layers or three layers or ten layers? It gets a lot harder to tilt
569280	574160	the sample so you can look straight down a column of atoms. This is another reason
574160	578600	that we like to keep the samples really super thin. The sample looks a lot
578600	582200	different now because we're actually focused on it which is you know the
582200	585960	first step. The next step is to get the sample tilted so that it's actually
585960	590360	pointed at us. The sample need not load in perfectly flat with respect to the
590360	594680	beam. The good news is that we can use the electrons passing through the sample
594680	598200	and making diffraction patterns to actually help us line this up. So you've
598200	602160	got this awesome starburst pattern called a kukuchi pattern and basically just
602160	605000	want to line this up so that we're looking at the center of this starburst
605000	610920	which is called the zone axis. Make it look real starbursty and not really. The
610920	614400	sample might be a little little thin for that. So I hope that explanation made
614400	617600	sense because I'm about to rip the rug out from underneath it. While it's
617600	623240	possible to image atomic scale features using this very technique where you're
623240	627720	basically casting shadows of atoms, all of these extra fringes and patterns
628040	632440	sometimes make it difficult to interpret what you're looking at which is why at
632440	637160	some point somebody added one extra letter. High resolution transmission electron
637160	641800	microscopy becoming high resolution scanning transmission electron
641800	647560	microscopy. Linguistically almost the same. Physically mechanistically
647560	652280	completely different things. So as soon as I push this button right here marked
652280	656680	stem the microscope is going to switch modes and all of my explanations so far
656680	660200	and a lot of this talk of projected shadows is going to have to change.
664840	669800	All right so now we've switched modes. Where TEM was pretty well represented by
669800	677000	a flashlight and some lenses to create big parallel beams, stem or S TEM is
677000	683560	probably best represented by a laser mounted on a gimbal and that is to say
683560	689240	it's a lot more fun. So what does it mean to scan an image? Basically instead of
689240	693960	taking the whole image at once you're rastering the beam back and forth
693960	699560	taking the image one pixel at a time and in order to do that the electron beam
699560	704600	isn't a parallel beam that covers the entire sample illuminating it at once.
704600	711080	You actually focus the beam down to a point that is smaller than an atom. So
711080	714360	that's basically what's happening here where the gimbal is guiding this laser
714360	718840	back and forth rastering across our field of ping-pong ball atoms.
718840	723480	Sometimes the laser hits an atom and causes light to scatter in all directions
723480	727320	and sometimes the laser doesn't hit an atom, goes straight through
727320	732040	and runs into the back plate. So now I'm playing part of the microscope
732040	735480	sensor. I know where the gimbal is pointed at all times
735480	739000	and I can tell whether or not the beam is going through because I can look for
739000	745080	the green dot on the piece of cardboard but I can't actually see the sample.
745080	749080	In reality this is because the sample is microscopic and therefore basically
749080	752200	invisible but this is the exact procedure that the
752200	756120	computer does when it's rastering the beam over the sample
756120	760040	trying to find atoms. You can tell that I'm making a couple
760040	763800	mistakes in counting here. Apparently my counting in my head is a
763800	767000	little bit faster than the gimbal actually does because I keep not
767000	769880	having enough room at the end of my rows but
769880	773640	as I fill this grid in we can start to see the shape of
773640	776760	the 16 ping-pong balls that are forming our atoms.
776760	780280	In a real microscope what I'm doing here would be known as a bright field
780280	785240	image. I've just inverted it. So after minutes of filling in grid spots
785240	790280	I now have my picture of atoms with some scattered effects because I can't
790280	793240	actually count. And if you imagine this happening really
793240	797080	fast where the computer guides a tiny beam of electrons across the sample
797080	801800	line by line over and over again you can imagine that images can get formed
801800	805560	pretty quickly. In fact that's what these scan lines are when you're
805560	809240	you know watching any image on the screen. It's going over and over and over
809240	812840	again continuously refreshing the image one line at a time.
812840	816920	It's actually scanning the electron beam back and forth
816920	821640	line by line to rebuild the picture. The real trick now is that the beam needs to
821640	826040	be focused to a small point as possible. If the beam can illuminate
826040	829960	multiple atoms at once then you just get a blurred out signal because you're
829960	834360	always hitting something with the beam and always letting some of the beam
834360	837720	through. If I were to replace this laser with
837720	841560	the flashlight from before you can see that no matter where the flashlight
841560	844680	points there's always some light getting to the
844680	848040	detector at the back which means that it can't really tell where the
848040	851160	atoms are. The flashlight light is just
851160	854680	too wide which is why when setting up a stem measurement
854680	858360	I take quite a long time here running through all of these different modes
858360	862120	sort of oscillating the focus of the beam and playing all sorts of tricks
862120	866120	in order to get it focused down to a tight as spot as possible.
866120	870360	The smaller that that beam gets the better the resolution of the images that
870360	874040	I'll be able to form. And there we go now when we focus we have
874040	878920	a nice even beam. It gets really small. Still a little bit
878920	884040	of stig. See. And go over here to stem. Now we're
884040	887320	scanning. It's exciting. Gotta zoom out a little bit
887320	892840	and hopefully we will see the sample. There we go. Spin the scan around a
892840	896600	little bit and get it flat. So while on location Brian struggles to
896600	900520	focus and zoom in let me tell you what this sample actually is.
900520	903800	If you've watched my previous video about evaporating metals and
903880	907880	making molecular beams you may remember that our lab specializes in
907880	912040	depositing extraordinarily thin layers of crystals,
912040	915080	crystalline materials in this big vacuum chamber.
915080	919080	That means that we end up with these multi-layer sandwich kind of structures.
919080	922920	If you slice a cross-section out of one of these stacks then you get to see
922920	926760	all of the layers and find out if your process work. In this case we started
926760	930200	with a wafer of a semiconductor called gallium arsenide.
930200	934200	Deposited an extremely thin layer of lead selenide
934200	937400	and then a reasonably thick layer of tin selenide.
937400	942520	These two layers on top are actually the weird carbon and platinum slurry that I
942520	946520	talked about in the fib video that basically just get welded to the top of
946520	949720	the stack to protect it while I get it ready for the microscope. So you can
949720	953560	mostly ignore those. But this substrate the gallium arsenide
953560	956520	that's the place with the highest structural quality
956520	961080	because we didn't make it. But that means that it's the easiest place to see
961080	964600	atoms. So now if we want to see atoms all we
964600	970520	got to do is zoom in and look at that.
970840	974520	Atoms.
975000	980360	Not very focused atoms. I'm moving diff shift. Oh wait a minute I got a line I
980360	984600	shoot I didn't reach help. Iterative. Lots of steps need to be done more than
984600	987960	once. It's getting bigger getting smaller getting smaller getting bigger
987960	992600	turning back. Man this is a bendy film piece of junk.
992600	1000520	Who made this?
1002120	1008200	There we go look at that atoms. These are gallium and arsenic atoms to be
1008200	1010840	precise. If you're wondering how this grid of dots
1010840	1014120	actually corresponds to the gallium arsenide unit cell like the
1014120	1017960	crystalline pattern we're actually looking at it from a diagonal like
1017960	1020760	this. And then if all the atoms were a little
1020760	1025560	bit blurry there you go. So each of these fuzzy blobs is actually
1025560	1030760	two adjacent columns of atoms. One column of arsenics and one column of galliums.
1030760	1035320	So if you're not convinced by looking at all of these really fuzzy little blobs
1035320	1039560	here is a much better picture. This is probably my favorite stem picture that
1039560	1043160	I've ever taken and after a much longer exposure time a lot of
1043160	1046600	you know waiting for all the drift to go away and stuff like that and quite a
1046600	1050600	bit of processing in MATLAB after the fact. You can very clearly see the
1050600	1055240	double columns of atoms here. We call them dumbbells of gallium arsenide.
1055240	1058760	And in the top you'll notice that the pattern is actually different. It doesn't
1058760	1061720	have the dumbbells. This is lead selenide which forms a
1061720	1065480	completely different crystal structure. And what's happening in between
1065480	1069080	these two weird sort of fuzzy blobs that look like dislocations but aren't
1069080	1072760	really dislocations I think is really interesting.
1072760	1076440	But unfortunately it is outside the scope of this YouTube video.
1076440	1081640	So when I was filming this video I was actually looking at tin selenide which
1081640	1086440	is a different material. And tin selenide has layers. So I passed
1086440	1090200	through the gallium arsenide, the lead selenide, and now the tin
1090200	1094040	selenide. Let's try to find some some cool looking defects.
1094040	1097880	Although it appears we've lost our focus. This sample is not flat.
1097880	1102600	Holy mackerel. Oh I had it for a second. There we go.
1102600	1106360	Check it out. Atoms. In order to get a good picture of this what I actually
1106360	1110440	need to do is take a bunch of images and then stack them. So it's
1110440	1117240	microscopy. Looking at the smallest of things has a surprising overlap with
1117240	1120200	astrophotography where you're looking at the largest of
1120200	1123160	things. So right now I'm taking a sequence. So it's
1123160	1126200	going to take a whole bunch of pictures and you can notice that the whole frame
1126200	1129240	is shifting a little bit each time. So that's
1129240	1132840	the drift that you need to correct for. The same way that stars in the sky move
1132840	1136680	slowly and you need to correct for that. So tin selenide is this
1136680	1141800	layered structure. So you can see once we do a little bit of the
1141800	1146200	correction here this is two layers of atoms that are glued together and then
1146200	1149160	below it is two layers of atoms that are glued together and then below it are
1149160	1153160	two layers of atoms that are glued together. So you get this sort of
1153160	1156360	double layer structure going through the whole material. I'm looking for a
1156360	1161320	location where that layered thing gets screwed up in a very particular way
1161320	1165000	and that's a layer. Yeah this is not what I'm looking for. It's cool
1165000	1169080	it's atoms but it's not what I'm looking for.
1169720	1184680	Got a gap got a gap got a gap got a gap got a gap got a gap got a gap got a gap
1184680	1189000	got a gap all the way across. Okay no.
1189000	1192600	Possibly another hyper dislocation. I think those must be common
1192600	1197240	which itself would be interesting. So the actual defect I'm looking for is
1197240	1200840	basically a hiccup in the layered structure of the material.
1200840	1205040	Because each layer of tin cellonite is two atoms tall, and because of some weird stuff
1205040	1210080	happening at the interface, we expected that it was possible to get one region of the crystal
1210080	1212440	shifted with respect to the rest.
1212440	1217880	And in particular, we thought this shift might only be one atom tall, which would actually
1217880	1222320	be half of a layer, meaning that the top of one layer was bonded to the bottom of the
1222320	1226360	next layer and so on, creating this weird zipper structure at the boundary.
1226360	1231160	Unfortunately, even if the sample is chock-full of these, getting one lined up in a place
1231160	1236360	where I can photograph it requires quite a bit of luck and quite a bit of tedium.
1248360	1250360	God, it's an ugly picture.
1250360	1253360	That is absolutely what I'm looking for.
1254360	1262360	Okay, unless the tilt over here is so significant that it's making this not look like what it
1262360	1267360	should look like, which I guess is possible, I'm going to assume that I'm not tilted right,
1267360	1275360	and I'm going to pray that I can get back to this exact same spot later.
1275360	1277360	Okay, that big white dot.
1277360	1279360	It's next to that big white dot.
1284360	1290360	Oh, oh, oh, oh.
1293360	1295360	Yes!
1295360	1297360	Ah!
1298360	1300360	I got one.
1300360	1302360	Look at this.
1304360	1311360	That's between two layers, and then it's in the middle of a layer.
1312360	1318360	And then unfortunately, it's right next to another defect, which actually splits it apart again.
1318360	1323360	So this is like a two partial dislocations right here.
1323360	1326360	It breaks it and then it fixes it.
1326360	1328360	Oh, it's so cool.
1328360	1331360	Oh, this will be clean down here.
1335360	1337360	Neat.
1338360	1342360	I can't tell but I'm grinning.
1342360	1344360	This was annoying.
1344360	1349360	I think this is the first time that I've ever gone out looking for a particular defect.
1349360	1355360	Like, I want to see this thing and wasn't sure that it existed.
1355360	1362360	This was like three hours of tedious focusing on a really old, this is like a more than a year old
1362360	1365360	sample that came out of the fib.
1365360	1369360	And it's all like warped and stuff, which means it's really difficult to focus on
1369360	1372360	and it kept losing focus continuously.
1372360	1374360	But I did it.
1374360	1380360	So now I get to say, in a paper, that this defect exists in tinselinite because I have a picture of it.
1380360	1382360	That is science.
