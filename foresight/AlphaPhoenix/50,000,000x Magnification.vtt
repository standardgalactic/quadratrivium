00:00.000 --> 00:22.640
All right, so hey there everybody. I am back in the microscopy suite in the

00:22.640 --> 00:27.680
materials department at UCSB and I'm going to show you some atoms. So this

00:27.680 --> 00:34.480
huge like car-sized box and these four monitors, the huge cylinder behind those

00:34.480 --> 00:38.280
four monitors and some more equipment that's behind that back wall, together

00:38.280 --> 00:42.680
constitute an instrument called a scanning transmission electron microscope or

00:42.680 --> 00:47.640
stem. And today I'm going to show you exactly how this works. So my last

00:47.640 --> 00:52.240
microscopy video was making a play button, which was kind of a joke, but

00:52.240 --> 00:56.520
today I'm going to be doing some real research. I'm going to be looking for a

00:56.520 --> 01:01.160
specific defect in a crystalline material called tin selenide, and I'm not

01:01.160 --> 01:04.800
sure that I'm going to be able to find it, but either way I'll learn something. So

01:04.800 --> 01:08.080
this is going to be like real research happening right before your eyes on

01:08.080 --> 01:10.640
YouTube today.

01:19.040 --> 01:24.680
Now in order to actually blast electrons all the way through a sample of

01:24.680 --> 01:31.040
material in order to image its atoms, that sample needs to be really really

01:31.040 --> 01:37.600
really thin. Imagine you know shining a piece of light through a piece of light

01:37.600 --> 01:41.760
trying to shine a light through a piece of paper. You can see some light through

01:41.760 --> 01:45.840
a piece of paper, but now imagine trying to shine a light through a piece of

01:45.840 --> 01:50.560
plywood. It's just not going to work. So they're both the same thing, they're both

01:50.600 --> 01:56.080
cellulose, but one is a lot thicker and a lot denser. So when you're trying to

01:56.080 --> 02:00.200
make a transmission sample that you can shoot electrons all the way through, it

02:00.200 --> 02:05.280
needs to more resemble a sheet of paper, except a bunch of orders of magnitude

02:05.280 --> 02:09.640
thinner. I didn't actually film the sample preparation, but if you remember

02:09.640 --> 02:14.040
the focused ion beam from one of my previous videos, that's the machine that

02:14.040 --> 02:20.520
you use to create these unreasonably impossibly thin samples. For reference,

02:20.520 --> 02:25.800
the sample I'm about to look at here is mounted on this tiny flake of copper, but

02:25.800 --> 02:30.080
to see it, we're going to have to zoom in. On this flake of copper, there is

02:30.080 --> 02:34.720
actually a crescent shape, and in the crescent shape there are a few metal

02:34.720 --> 02:39.960
posts. If you zoom in on one of those posts, you can see a bump on the side.

02:39.960 --> 02:45.280
That's my sample. Looking even closer, hopefully you can appreciate how this

02:45.280 --> 02:50.720
entire sample is a vanishingly thin flag of material. It's about six

02:50.720 --> 02:57.520
micrometers tall, 14 micrometers long, and between 50 and 100 nanometers thin at

02:57.520 --> 03:02.200
the spot where I'll be imaging. Somewhere in the range of about 150 atoms

03:02.200 --> 03:07.280
thick, and this is what we'll be shooting electrons through to cast our shadows.

03:07.280 --> 03:13.000
Even though this copper crescent is like vaguely 100,000 times larger than the

03:13.040 --> 03:17.040
dimension we care about on the sample it's holding, it's still small enough that

03:17.040 --> 03:20.880
it's a pain to work with. So to help, we've got these fancy vacuum tweezers.

03:20.880 --> 03:25.280
Basically a tiny hose that sucks up the sample like a piece of cardboard stuck to

03:25.280 --> 03:29.680
a shop vac. This is more than a little finicky, and while trying to bend around

03:29.680 --> 03:34.000
to give the camera a good view, I actually dropped it the first time.

03:34.000 --> 03:41.160
Ah, crud. Something like this could only happen when I tried to film it.

03:41.520 --> 03:45.360
Thankfully the sample itself was all right. It's also worth appreciating that

03:45.360 --> 03:51.080
even this tiny sample stage is itself a miniature engineering marvel. It's

03:51.080 --> 03:55.560
designed to tilt the sample in two directions without translating it in

03:55.560 --> 04:00.680
X, Y, or Z by more than a couple microns. It's absurdly precise. This is actually

04:00.680 --> 04:04.560
some microscope footage from a time that the holder actually broke. I swear I was

04:04.560 --> 04:08.240
not pushing on the clip any harder than I should have been. But you can see that

04:08.240 --> 04:12.200
the hinge here that broke isn't a normal ball bearing or something like that.

04:12.200 --> 04:17.520
It's actually a ruby, like literally a polished gemstone that runs in a groove.

04:17.520 --> 04:22.520
So now that the sample is mounted inside of this chuck, if you'll follow me around

04:22.520 --> 04:29.200
the corner, in here we have the actual microscope. Like all electron microscopes,

04:29.200 --> 04:33.960
the stem here is basically just a big multi-compartment vacuum chamber, which

04:33.960 --> 04:37.000
means that this thing, when I load it into the chamber, needs to be able to

04:37.000 --> 04:40.640
stop all of the air from rushing in behind it. When I put this in, it's

04:40.640 --> 04:43.680
actually going to create a seal at this O-ring, and then I'm going to have to

04:43.680 --> 04:46.600
wait for a few minutes while it pumps out the air lock before I can push it

04:46.600 --> 04:49.800
all the way into the microscope.

04:49.800 --> 05:08.640
There we go. That was the pump start. And don't worry, if I made trying to load that

05:08.640 --> 05:12.400
sample look awfully tedious, just wait till I get to the part where I focus the

05:12.400 --> 05:17.200
microscope for an hour. Just like that. Air pressure pushes it right on in. I don't

05:17.240 --> 05:25.480
even have to do anything. A transmission electron microscope is basically casting

05:25.480 --> 05:30.320
shadows with a beam of electrons. You're shooting a high-energy beam of

05:30.320 --> 05:35.200
electrons all the way through a material, and you're projecting whatever gets

05:35.200 --> 05:41.400
through out onto a screen and looking at that image. Now because it is so much

05:41.400 --> 05:46.320
easier to visualize this when you don't use electrons, I'm going to be doing a

05:46.320 --> 05:51.680
demonstration with photons. If I have a point source of light, like this flashlight

05:51.680 --> 05:55.280
with a piece of poster board with a pinhole in it, any shape that I put in

05:55.280 --> 06:00.960
front of the light casts a shadow on this screen. And critically, the shadow is

06:00.960 --> 06:05.960
actually magnified based on the relative distances between the source, object, and

06:05.960 --> 06:15.520
screen. Huge wrench. Small wrench. Big wrench. Small wrench. I need to get out more.

06:15.720 --> 06:20.760
But if you notice, the edges of this shadow are a little bit fuzzy. If we try to look at

06:20.760 --> 06:25.280
something really tiny, let's say these ball bearings are like atoms being

06:25.280 --> 06:29.880
imaged in a microscope, this method doesn't really let us see anything. One of

06:29.880 --> 06:34.680
the multiple problems here is that the pinhole isn't actually a very good point

06:34.680 --> 06:39.040
source. It's almost the same size as the features that we're trying to image. So

06:39.040 --> 06:42.720
light from one edge of the pinhole and light from the other edge of the pinhole

06:42.760 --> 06:49.160
actually cast very slightly different overlapping shadows. And in order to

06:49.160 --> 06:53.960
accurately image the atoms then, all our electrons would need to originate from a

06:53.960 --> 06:59.320
point in space that's smaller than an atom. And we can't do that. If we're

06:59.320 --> 07:04.800
slightly more clever, we can use lenses to project a sharp image, even with a

07:04.800 --> 07:09.800
less-than-perfect source of light. Here I've set a lens so that as light exits

07:09.880 --> 07:15.040
this pinhole, it's actually made into a nearly parallel beam. That parallel beam

07:15.040 --> 07:19.520
passes through the ball bearings and a shadow is created. And then we can take

07:19.520 --> 07:24.360
that beam and if everything is lined up just right, blow it up to project a

07:24.360 --> 07:29.360
larger shadow on the screen. Once we send it through here, it gets smaller,

07:29.360 --> 07:37.040
comes down to a point and then blows up and expands out here. So we have a

07:37.640 --> 07:43.160
magnified image on the screen. Remarkably sharp. Much, much better than I thought

07:43.160 --> 07:47.440
I'd get with this. Those are our atoms. Just imagine that instead of a flashlight

07:47.440 --> 07:52.320
with a pinhole, we have an electron gun powered by a huge high-voltage power

07:52.320 --> 07:57.360
supply and instead of glass lenses, we have really big electromagnets that

07:57.360 --> 08:01.160
bend that beam of electrons as it's passing through the microscope. Now

08:01.160 --> 08:05.360
compared to our flashlight model, the electron gun is at the top of this

08:05.360 --> 08:10.600
system and it's focused by a series of magnetic lenses capable of bending the

08:10.600 --> 08:15.040
electron beam onto the sample and then through the sample and then through more

08:15.040 --> 08:19.560
lenses that expand that image into a camera. Now when we turn this whole

08:19.560 --> 08:24.400
shebang on, we literally just get a shadow image of the copper crescent. Pretty

08:24.400 --> 08:28.800
cool, right? Yeah, so here you can really see that the the place where there is

08:28.800 --> 08:33.160
nothing like this, you know, you can just see bright because that's where the

08:33.200 --> 08:38.200
electrons are hitting uninhibited. This thing is the big chunk of copper that

08:38.200 --> 08:43.040
the electrons can't get through so it looks black and this is the sample which

08:43.040 --> 08:47.560
is so thin that it's electron transparent and it actually sort of looks

08:47.560 --> 08:52.360
gray because it'll let some electrons through which is kind of the point. You

08:52.360 --> 08:56.320
can see huge bits of strain and bending in the sample as it's sort of warping

08:56.320 --> 09:00.240
around. It's really interesting. Right now what we need to do is basically get

09:00.240 --> 09:03.720
the beam pointed at the sample and get the sample pointed at the beam. Getting

09:03.720 --> 09:07.280
the beam pointed at the sample sounds pretty straightforward but getting the

09:07.280 --> 09:11.880
sample pointed at the beam, that's a weirder phrase. You need to remember that

09:11.880 --> 09:17.960
we're dealing with a crystal, this perfect 3d grid of atoms in space. Now

09:17.960 --> 09:22.360
earlier I used the ball bearings to emulate a single layer of atoms but what

09:22.360 --> 09:29.240
if I had two layers or three layers or ten layers? It gets a lot harder to tilt

09:29.280 --> 09:34.160
the sample so you can look straight down a column of atoms. This is another reason

09:34.160 --> 09:38.600
that we like to keep the samples really super thin. The sample looks a lot

09:38.600 --> 09:42.200
different now because we're actually focused on it which is you know the

09:42.200 --> 09:45.960
first step. The next step is to get the sample tilted so that it's actually

09:45.960 --> 09:50.360
pointed at us. The sample need not load in perfectly flat with respect to the

09:50.360 --> 09:54.680
beam. The good news is that we can use the electrons passing through the sample

09:54.680 --> 09:58.200
and making diffraction patterns to actually help us line this up. So you've

09:58.200 --> 10:02.160
got this awesome starburst pattern called a kukuchi pattern and basically just

10:02.160 --> 10:05.000
want to line this up so that we're looking at the center of this starburst

10:05.000 --> 10:10.920
which is called the zone axis. Make it look real starbursty and not really. The

10:10.920 --> 10:14.400
sample might be a little little thin for that. So I hope that explanation made

10:14.400 --> 10:17.600
sense because I'm about to rip the rug out from underneath it. While it's

10:17.600 --> 10:23.240
possible to image atomic scale features using this very technique where you're

10:23.240 --> 10:27.720
basically casting shadows of atoms, all of these extra fringes and patterns

10:28.040 --> 10:32.440
sometimes make it difficult to interpret what you're looking at which is why at

10:32.440 --> 10:37.160
some point somebody added one extra letter. High resolution transmission electron

10:37.160 --> 10:41.800
microscopy becoming high resolution scanning transmission electron

10:41.800 --> 10:47.560
microscopy. Linguistically almost the same. Physically mechanistically

10:47.560 --> 10:52.280
completely different things. So as soon as I push this button right here marked

10:52.280 --> 10:56.680
stem the microscope is going to switch modes and all of my explanations so far

10:56.680 --> 11:00.200
and a lot of this talk of projected shadows is going to have to change.

11:04.840 --> 11:09.800
All right so now we've switched modes. Where TEM was pretty well represented by

11:09.800 --> 11:17.000
a flashlight and some lenses to create big parallel beams, stem or S TEM is

11:17.000 --> 11:23.560
probably best represented by a laser mounted on a gimbal and that is to say

11:23.560 --> 11:29.240
it's a lot more fun. So what does it mean to scan an image? Basically instead of

11:29.240 --> 11:33.960
taking the whole image at once you're rastering the beam back and forth

11:33.960 --> 11:39.560
taking the image one pixel at a time and in order to do that the electron beam

11:39.560 --> 11:44.600
isn't a parallel beam that covers the entire sample illuminating it at once.

11:44.600 --> 11:51.080
You actually focus the beam down to a point that is smaller than an atom. So

11:51.080 --> 11:54.360
that's basically what's happening here where the gimbal is guiding this laser

11:54.360 --> 11:58.840
back and forth rastering across our field of ping-pong ball atoms.

11:58.840 --> 12:03.480
Sometimes the laser hits an atom and causes light to scatter in all directions

12:03.480 --> 12:07.320
and sometimes the laser doesn't hit an atom, goes straight through

12:07.320 --> 12:12.040
and runs into the back plate. So now I'm playing part of the microscope

12:12.040 --> 12:15.480
sensor. I know where the gimbal is pointed at all times

12:15.480 --> 12:19.000
and I can tell whether or not the beam is going through because I can look for

12:19.000 --> 12:25.080
the green dot on the piece of cardboard but I can't actually see the sample.

12:25.080 --> 12:29.080
In reality this is because the sample is microscopic and therefore basically

12:29.080 --> 12:32.200
invisible but this is the exact procedure that the

12:32.200 --> 12:36.120
computer does when it's rastering the beam over the sample

12:36.120 --> 12:40.040
trying to find atoms. You can tell that I'm making a couple

12:40.040 --> 12:43.800
mistakes in counting here. Apparently my counting in my head is a

12:43.800 --> 12:47.000
little bit faster than the gimbal actually does because I keep not

12:47.000 --> 12:49.880
having enough room at the end of my rows but

12:49.880 --> 12:53.640
as I fill this grid in we can start to see the shape of

12:53.640 --> 12:56.760
the 16 ping-pong balls that are forming our atoms.

12:56.760 --> 13:00.280
In a real microscope what I'm doing here would be known as a bright field

13:00.280 --> 13:05.240
image. I've just inverted it. So after minutes of filling in grid spots

13:05.240 --> 13:10.280
I now have my picture of atoms with some scattered effects because I can't

13:10.280 --> 13:13.240
actually count. And if you imagine this happening really

13:13.240 --> 13:17.080
fast where the computer guides a tiny beam of electrons across the sample

13:17.080 --> 13:21.800
line by line over and over again you can imagine that images can get formed

13:21.800 --> 13:25.560
pretty quickly. In fact that's what these scan lines are when you're

13:25.560 --> 13:29.240
you know watching any image on the screen. It's going over and over and over

13:29.240 --> 13:32.840
again continuously refreshing the image one line at a time.

13:32.840 --> 13:36.920
It's actually scanning the electron beam back and forth

13:36.920 --> 13:41.640
line by line to rebuild the picture. The real trick now is that the beam needs to

13:41.640 --> 13:46.040
be focused to a small point as possible. If the beam can illuminate

13:46.040 --> 13:49.960
multiple atoms at once then you just get a blurred out signal because you're

13:49.960 --> 13:54.360
always hitting something with the beam and always letting some of the beam

13:54.360 --> 13:57.720
through. If I were to replace this laser with

13:57.720 --> 14:01.560
the flashlight from before you can see that no matter where the flashlight

14:01.560 --> 14:04.680
points there's always some light getting to the

14:04.680 --> 14:08.040
detector at the back which means that it can't really tell where the

14:08.040 --> 14:11.160
atoms are. The flashlight light is just

14:11.160 --> 14:14.680
too wide which is why when setting up a stem measurement

14:14.680 --> 14:18.360
I take quite a long time here running through all of these different modes

14:18.360 --> 14:22.120
sort of oscillating the focus of the beam and playing all sorts of tricks

14:22.120 --> 14:26.120
in order to get it focused down to a tight as spot as possible.

14:26.120 --> 14:30.360
The smaller that that beam gets the better the resolution of the images that

14:30.360 --> 14:34.040
I'll be able to form. And there we go now when we focus we have

14:34.040 --> 14:38.920
a nice even beam. It gets really small. Still a little bit

14:38.920 --> 14:44.040
of stig. See. And go over here to stem. Now we're

14:44.040 --> 14:47.320
scanning. It's exciting. Gotta zoom out a little bit

14:47.320 --> 14:52.840
and hopefully we will see the sample. There we go. Spin the scan around a

14:52.840 --> 14:56.600
little bit and get it flat. So while on location Brian struggles to

14:56.600 --> 15:00.520
focus and zoom in let me tell you what this sample actually is.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.800
If you've watched my previous video about evaporating metals and

15:03.880 --> 15:07.880
making molecular beams you may remember that our lab specializes in

15:07.880 --> 15:12.040
depositing extraordinarily thin layers of crystals,

15:12.040 --> 15:15.080
crystalline materials in this big vacuum chamber.

15:15.080 --> 15:19.080
That means that we end up with these multi-layer sandwich kind of structures.

15:19.080 --> 15:22.920
If you slice a cross-section out of one of these stacks then you get to see

15:22.920 --> 15:26.760
all of the layers and find out if your process work. In this case we started

15:26.760 --> 15:30.200
with a wafer of a semiconductor called gallium arsenide.

15:30.200 --> 15:34.200
Deposited an extremely thin layer of lead selenide

15:34.200 --> 15:37.400
and then a reasonably thick layer of tin selenide.

15:37.400 --> 15:42.520
These two layers on top are actually the weird carbon and platinum slurry that I

15:42.520 --> 15:46.520
talked about in the fib video that basically just get welded to the top of

15:46.520 --> 15:49.720
the stack to protect it while I get it ready for the microscope. So you can

15:49.720 --> 15:53.560
mostly ignore those. But this substrate the gallium arsenide

15:53.560 --> 15:56.520
that's the place with the highest structural quality

15:56.520 --> 16:01.080
because we didn't make it. But that means that it's the easiest place to see

16:01.080 --> 16:04.600
atoms. So now if we want to see atoms all we

16:04.600 --> 16:10.520
got to do is zoom in and look at that.

16:10.840 --> 16:14.520
Atoms.

16:15.000 --> 16:20.360
Not very focused atoms. I'm moving diff shift. Oh wait a minute I got a line I

16:20.360 --> 16:24.600
shoot I didn't reach help. Iterative. Lots of steps need to be done more than

16:24.600 --> 16:27.960
once. It's getting bigger getting smaller getting smaller getting bigger

16:27.960 --> 16:32.600
turning back. Man this is a bendy film piece of junk.

16:32.600 --> 16:40.520
Who made this?

16:42.120 --> 16:48.200
There we go look at that atoms. These are gallium and arsenic atoms to be

16:48.200 --> 16:50.840
precise. If you're wondering how this grid of dots

16:50.840 --> 16:54.120
actually corresponds to the gallium arsenide unit cell like the

16:54.120 --> 16:57.960
crystalline pattern we're actually looking at it from a diagonal like

16:57.960 --> 17:00.760
this. And then if all the atoms were a little

17:00.760 --> 17:05.560
bit blurry there you go. So each of these fuzzy blobs is actually

17:05.560 --> 17:10.760
two adjacent columns of atoms. One column of arsenics and one column of galliums.

17:10.760 --> 17:15.320
So if you're not convinced by looking at all of these really fuzzy little blobs

17:15.320 --> 17:19.560
here is a much better picture. This is probably my favorite stem picture that

17:19.560 --> 17:23.160
I've ever taken and after a much longer exposure time a lot of

17:23.160 --> 17:26.600
you know waiting for all the drift to go away and stuff like that and quite a

17:26.600 --> 17:30.600
bit of processing in MATLAB after the fact. You can very clearly see the

17:30.600 --> 17:35.240
double columns of atoms here. We call them dumbbells of gallium arsenide.

17:35.240 --> 17:38.760
And in the top you'll notice that the pattern is actually different. It doesn't

17:38.760 --> 17:41.720
have the dumbbells. This is lead selenide which forms a

17:41.720 --> 17:45.480
completely different crystal structure. And what's happening in between

17:45.480 --> 17:49.080
these two weird sort of fuzzy blobs that look like dislocations but aren't

17:49.080 --> 17:52.760
really dislocations I think is really interesting.

17:52.760 --> 17:56.440
But unfortunately it is outside the scope of this YouTube video.

17:56.440 --> 18:01.640
So when I was filming this video I was actually looking at tin selenide which

18:01.640 --> 18:06.440
is a different material. And tin selenide has layers. So I passed

18:06.440 --> 18:10.200
through the gallium arsenide, the lead selenide, and now the tin

18:10.200 --> 18:14.040
selenide. Let's try to find some some cool looking defects.

18:14.040 --> 18:17.880
Although it appears we've lost our focus. This sample is not flat.

18:17.880 --> 18:22.600
Holy mackerel. Oh I had it for a second. There we go.

18:22.600 --> 18:26.360
Check it out. Atoms. In order to get a good picture of this what I actually

18:26.360 --> 18:30.440
need to do is take a bunch of images and then stack them. So it's

18:30.440 --> 18:37.240
microscopy. Looking at the smallest of things has a surprising overlap with

18:37.240 --> 18:40.200
astrophotography where you're looking at the largest of

18:40.200 --> 18:43.160
things. So right now I'm taking a sequence. So it's

18:43.160 --> 18:46.200
going to take a whole bunch of pictures and you can notice that the whole frame

18:46.200 --> 18:49.240
is shifting a little bit each time. So that's

18:49.240 --> 18:52.840
the drift that you need to correct for. The same way that stars in the sky move

18:52.840 --> 18:56.680
slowly and you need to correct for that. So tin selenide is this

18:56.680 --> 19:01.800
layered structure. So you can see once we do a little bit of the

19:01.800 --> 19:06.200
correction here this is two layers of atoms that are glued together and then

19:06.200 --> 19:09.160
below it is two layers of atoms that are glued together and then below it are

19:09.160 --> 19:13.160
two layers of atoms that are glued together. So you get this sort of

19:13.160 --> 19:16.360
double layer structure going through the whole material. I'm looking for a

19:16.360 --> 19:21.320
location where that layered thing gets screwed up in a very particular way

19:21.320 --> 19:25.000
and that's a layer. Yeah this is not what I'm looking for. It's cool

19:25.000 --> 19:29.080
it's atoms but it's not what I'm looking for.

19:29.720 --> 19:44.680
Got a gap got a gap got a gap got a gap got a gap got a gap got a gap got a gap

19:44.680 --> 19:49.000
got a gap all the way across. Okay no.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.600
Possibly another hyper dislocation. I think those must be common

19:52.600 --> 19:57.240
which itself would be interesting. So the actual defect I'm looking for is

19:57.240 --> 20:00.840
basically a hiccup in the layered structure of the material.

20:00.840 --> 20:05.040
Because each layer of tin cellonite is two atoms tall, and because of some weird stuff

20:05.040 --> 20:10.080
happening at the interface, we expected that it was possible to get one region of the crystal

20:10.080 --> 20:12.440
shifted with respect to the rest.

20:12.440 --> 20:17.880
And in particular, we thought this shift might only be one atom tall, which would actually

20:17.880 --> 20:22.320
be half of a layer, meaning that the top of one layer was bonded to the bottom of the

20:22.320 --> 20:26.360
next layer and so on, creating this weird zipper structure at the boundary.

20:26.360 --> 20:31.160
Unfortunately, even if the sample is chock-full of these, getting one lined up in a place

20:31.160 --> 20:36.360
where I can photograph it requires quite a bit of luck and quite a bit of tedium.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.360
God, it's an ugly picture.

20:50.360 --> 20:53.360
That is absolutely what I'm looking for.

20:54.360 --> 21:02.360
Okay, unless the tilt over here is so significant that it's making this not look like what it

21:02.360 --> 21:07.360
should look like, which I guess is possible, I'm going to assume that I'm not tilted right,

21:07.360 --> 21:15.360
and I'm going to pray that I can get back to this exact same spot later.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.360
Okay, that big white dot.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.360
It's next to that big white dot.

21:24.360 --> 21:30.360
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.360
Yes!

21:35.360 --> 21:37.360
Ah!

21:38.360 --> 21:40.360
I got one.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.360
Look at this.

21:44.360 --> 21:51.360
That's between two layers, and then it's in the middle of a layer.

21:52.360 --> 21:58.360
And then unfortunately, it's right next to another defect, which actually splits it apart again.

21:58.360 --> 22:03.360
So this is like a two partial dislocations right here.

22:03.360 --> 22:06.360
It breaks it and then it fixes it.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.360
Oh, it's so cool.

22:08.360 --> 22:11.360
Oh, this will be clean down here.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.360
Neat.

22:18.360 --> 22:22.360
I can't tell but I'm grinning.

22:22.360 --> 22:24.360
This was annoying.

22:24.360 --> 22:29.360
I think this is the first time that I've ever gone out looking for a particular defect.

22:29.360 --> 22:35.360
Like, I want to see this thing and wasn't sure that it existed.

22:35.360 --> 22:42.360
This was like three hours of tedious focusing on a really old, this is like a more than a year old

22:42.360 --> 22:45.360
sample that came out of the fib.

22:45.360 --> 22:49.360
And it's all like warped and stuff, which means it's really difficult to focus on

22:49.360 --> 22:52.360
and it kept losing focus continuously.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.360
But I did it.

22:54.360 --> 23:00.360
So now I get to say, in a paper, that this defect exists in tinselinite because I have a picture of it.

23:00.360 --> 23:02.360
That is science.
