1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,640
All right, so hey there everybody. I am back in the microscopy suite in the

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,680
materials department at UCSB and I'm going to show you some atoms. So this

3
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,480
huge like car-sized box and these four monitors, the huge cylinder behind those

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,280
four monitors and some more equipment that's behind that back wall, together

5
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,680
constitute an instrument called a scanning transmission electron microscope or

6
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,640
stem. And today I'm going to show you exactly how this works. So my last

7
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,240
microscopy video was making a play button, which was kind of a joke, but

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,520
today I'm going to be doing some real research. I'm going to be looking for a

9
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,160
specific defect in a crystalline material called tin selenide, and I'm not

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,800
sure that I'm going to be able to find it, but either way I'll learn something. So

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,080
this is going to be like real research happening right before your eyes on

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,640
YouTube today.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,680
Now in order to actually blast electrons all the way through a sample of

14
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:31,040
material in order to image its atoms, that sample needs to be really really

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,600
really thin. Imagine you know shining a piece of light through a piece of light

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,760
trying to shine a light through a piece of paper. You can see some light through

17
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,840
a piece of paper, but now imagine trying to shine a light through a piece of

18
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,560
plywood. It's just not going to work. So they're both the same thing, they're both

19
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,080
cellulose, but one is a lot thicker and a lot denser. So when you're trying to

20
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,200
make a transmission sample that you can shoot electrons all the way through, it

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,280
needs to more resemble a sheet of paper, except a bunch of orders of magnitude

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,640
thinner. I didn't actually film the sample preparation, but if you remember

23
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,040
the focused ion beam from one of my previous videos, that's the machine that

24
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,520
you use to create these unreasonably impossibly thin samples. For reference,

25
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,800
the sample I'm about to look at here is mounted on this tiny flake of copper, but

26
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,080
to see it, we're going to have to zoom in. On this flake of copper, there is

27
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,720
actually a crescent shape, and in the crescent shape there are a few metal

28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,960
posts. If you zoom in on one of those posts, you can see a bump on the side.

29
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,280
That's my sample. Looking even closer, hopefully you can appreciate how this

30
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,720
entire sample is a vanishingly thin flag of material. It's about six

31
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,520
micrometers tall, 14 micrometers long, and between 50 and 100 nanometers thin at

32
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,200
the spot where I'll be imaging. Somewhere in the range of about 150 atoms

33
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,280
thick, and this is what we'll be shooting electrons through to cast our shadows.

34
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,000
Even though this copper crescent is like vaguely 100,000 times larger than the

35
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,040
dimension we care about on the sample it's holding, it's still small enough that

36
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,880
it's a pain to work with. So to help, we've got these fancy vacuum tweezers.

37
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,280
Basically a tiny hose that sucks up the sample like a piece of cardboard stuck to

38
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,680
a shop vac. This is more than a little finicky, and while trying to bend around

39
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,000
to give the camera a good view, I actually dropped it the first time.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,160
Ah, crud. Something like this could only happen when I tried to film it.

41
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,360
Thankfully the sample itself was all right. It's also worth appreciating that

42
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,080
even this tiny sample stage is itself a miniature engineering marvel. It's

43
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,560
designed to tilt the sample in two directions without translating it in

44
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,680
X, Y, or Z by more than a couple microns. It's absurdly precise. This is actually

45
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,560
some microscope footage from a time that the holder actually broke. I swear I was

46
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,240
not pushing on the clip any harder than I should have been. But you can see that

47
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,200
the hinge here that broke isn't a normal ball bearing or something like that.

48
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,520
It's actually a ruby, like literally a polished gemstone that runs in a groove.

49
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,520
So now that the sample is mounted inside of this chuck, if you'll follow me around

50
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:29,200
the corner, in here we have the actual microscope. Like all electron microscopes,

51
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,960
the stem here is basically just a big multi-compartment vacuum chamber, which

52
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,000
means that this thing, when I load it into the chamber, needs to be able to

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,640
stop all of the air from rushing in behind it. When I put this in, it's

54
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,680
actually going to create a seal at this O-ring, and then I'm going to have to

55
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,600
wait for a few minutes while it pumps out the air lock before I can push it

56
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,800
all the way into the microscope.

57
00:04:49,800 --> 00:05:08,640
There we go. That was the pump start. And don't worry, if I made trying to load that

58
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,400
sample look awfully tedious, just wait till I get to the part where I focus the

59
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,200
microscope for an hour. Just like that. Air pressure pushes it right on in. I don't

60
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:25,480
even have to do anything. A transmission electron microscope is basically casting

61
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,320
shadows with a beam of electrons. You're shooting a high-energy beam of

62
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,200
electrons all the way through a material, and you're projecting whatever gets

63
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,400
through out onto a screen and looking at that image. Now because it is so much

64
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,320
easier to visualize this when you don't use electrons, I'm going to be doing a

65
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,680
demonstration with photons. If I have a point source of light, like this flashlight

66
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,280
with a piece of poster board with a pinhole in it, any shape that I put in

67
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,960
front of the light casts a shadow on this screen. And critically, the shadow is

68
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,960
actually magnified based on the relative distances between the source, object, and

69
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:15,520
screen. Huge wrench. Small wrench. Big wrench. Small wrench. I need to get out more.

70
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,760
But if you notice, the edges of this shadow are a little bit fuzzy. If we try to look at

71
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,280
something really tiny, let's say these ball bearings are like atoms being

72
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,880
imaged in a microscope, this method doesn't really let us see anything. One of

73
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,680
the multiple problems here is that the pinhole isn't actually a very good point

74
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,040
source. It's almost the same size as the features that we're trying to image. So

75
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,720
light from one edge of the pinhole and light from the other edge of the pinhole

76
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:49,160
actually cast very slightly different overlapping shadows. And in order to

77
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,960
accurately image the atoms then, all our electrons would need to originate from a

78
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:59,320
point in space that's smaller than an atom. And we can't do that. If we're

79
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,800
slightly more clever, we can use lenses to project a sharp image, even with a

80
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,800
less-than-perfect source of light. Here I've set a lens so that as light exits

81
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,040
this pinhole, it's actually made into a nearly parallel beam. That parallel beam

82
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,520
passes through the ball bearings and a shadow is created. And then we can take

83
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,360
that beam and if everything is lined up just right, blow it up to project a

84
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,360
larger shadow on the screen. Once we send it through here, it gets smaller,

85
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:37,040
comes down to a point and then blows up and expands out here. So we have a

86
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:43,160
magnified image on the screen. Remarkably sharp. Much, much better than I thought

87
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,440
I'd get with this. Those are our atoms. Just imagine that instead of a flashlight

88
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,320
with a pinhole, we have an electron gun powered by a huge high-voltage power

89
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,360
supply and instead of glass lenses, we have really big electromagnets that

90
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,160
bend that beam of electrons as it's passing through the microscope. Now

91
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,360
compared to our flashlight model, the electron gun is at the top of this

92
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,600
system and it's focused by a series of magnetic lenses capable of bending the

93
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,040
electron beam onto the sample and then through the sample and then through more

94
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,560
lenses that expand that image into a camera. Now when we turn this whole

95
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,400
shebang on, we literally just get a shadow image of the copper crescent. Pretty

96
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,800
cool, right? Yeah, so here you can really see that the the place where there is

97
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,160
nothing like this, you know, you can just see bright because that's where the

98
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,200
electrons are hitting uninhibited. This thing is the big chunk of copper that

99
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:43,040
the electrons can't get through so it looks black and this is the sample which

100
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,560
is so thin that it's electron transparent and it actually sort of looks

101
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,360
gray because it'll let some electrons through which is kind of the point. You

102
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,320
can see huge bits of strain and bending in the sample as it's sort of warping

103
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,240
around. It's really interesting. Right now what we need to do is basically get

104
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,720
the beam pointed at the sample and get the sample pointed at the beam. Getting

105
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,280
the beam pointed at the sample sounds pretty straightforward but getting the

106
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,880
sample pointed at the beam, that's a weirder phrase. You need to remember that

107
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,960
we're dealing with a crystal, this perfect 3d grid of atoms in space. Now

108
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,360
earlier I used the ball bearings to emulate a single layer of atoms but what

109
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:29,240
if I had two layers or three layers or ten layers? It gets a lot harder to tilt

110
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,160
the sample so you can look straight down a column of atoms. This is another reason

111
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,600
that we like to keep the samples really super thin. The sample looks a lot

112
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,200
different now because we're actually focused on it which is you know the

113
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,960
first step. The next step is to get the sample tilted so that it's actually

114
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,360
pointed at us. The sample need not load in perfectly flat with respect to the

115
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,680
beam. The good news is that we can use the electrons passing through the sample

116
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,200
and making diffraction patterns to actually help us line this up. So you've

117
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,160
got this awesome starburst pattern called a kukuchi pattern and basically just

118
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,000
want to line this up so that we're looking at the center of this starburst

119
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,920
which is called the zone axis. Make it look real starbursty and not really. The

120
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,400
sample might be a little little thin for that. So I hope that explanation made

121
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,600
sense because I'm about to rip the rug out from underneath it. While it's

122
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,240
possible to image atomic scale features using this very technique where you're

123
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,720
basically casting shadows of atoms, all of these extra fringes and patterns

124
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,440
sometimes make it difficult to interpret what you're looking at which is why at

125
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,160
some point somebody added one extra letter. High resolution transmission electron

126
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,800
microscopy becoming high resolution scanning transmission electron

127
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,560
microscopy. Linguistically almost the same. Physically mechanistically

128
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,280
completely different things. So as soon as I push this button right here marked

129
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,680
stem the microscope is going to switch modes and all of my explanations so far

130
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,200
and a lot of this talk of projected shadows is going to have to change.

131
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,800
All right so now we've switched modes. Where TEM was pretty well represented by

132
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:17,000
a flashlight and some lenses to create big parallel beams, stem or S TEM is

133
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,560
probably best represented by a laser mounted on a gimbal and that is to say

134
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,240
it's a lot more fun. So what does it mean to scan an image? Basically instead of

135
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,960
taking the whole image at once you're rastering the beam back and forth

136
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,560
taking the image one pixel at a time and in order to do that the electron beam

137
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,600
isn't a parallel beam that covers the entire sample illuminating it at once.

138
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:51,080
You actually focus the beam down to a point that is smaller than an atom. So

139
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,360
that's basically what's happening here where the gimbal is guiding this laser

140
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,840
back and forth rastering across our field of ping-pong ball atoms.

141
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,480
Sometimes the laser hits an atom and causes light to scatter in all directions

142
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,320
and sometimes the laser doesn't hit an atom, goes straight through

143
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,040
and runs into the back plate. So now I'm playing part of the microscope

144
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,480
sensor. I know where the gimbal is pointed at all times

145
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,000
and I can tell whether or not the beam is going through because I can look for

146
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,080
the green dot on the piece of cardboard but I can't actually see the sample.

147
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,080
In reality this is because the sample is microscopic and therefore basically

148
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,200
invisible but this is the exact procedure that the

149
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,120
computer does when it's rastering the beam over the sample

150
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,040
trying to find atoms. You can tell that I'm making a couple

151
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,800
mistakes in counting here. Apparently my counting in my head is a

152
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,000
little bit faster than the gimbal actually does because I keep not

153
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,880
having enough room at the end of my rows but

154
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,640
as I fill this grid in we can start to see the shape of

155
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,760
the 16 ping-pong balls that are forming our atoms.

156
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,280
In a real microscope what I'm doing here would be known as a bright field

157
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,240
image. I've just inverted it. So after minutes of filling in grid spots

158
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,280
I now have my picture of atoms with some scattered effects because I can't

159
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,240
actually count. And if you imagine this happening really

160
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,080
fast where the computer guides a tiny beam of electrons across the sample

161
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,800
line by line over and over again you can imagine that images can get formed

162
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,560
pretty quickly. In fact that's what these scan lines are when you're

163
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,240
you know watching any image on the screen. It's going over and over and over

164
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,840
again continuously refreshing the image one line at a time.

165
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,920
It's actually scanning the electron beam back and forth

166
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,640
line by line to rebuild the picture. The real trick now is that the beam needs to

167
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,040
be focused to a small point as possible. If the beam can illuminate

168
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,960
multiple atoms at once then you just get a blurred out signal because you're

169
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,360
always hitting something with the beam and always letting some of the beam

170
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,720
through. If I were to replace this laser with

171
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,560
the flashlight from before you can see that no matter where the flashlight

172
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,680
points there's always some light getting to the

173
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,040
detector at the back which means that it can't really tell where the

174
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,160
atoms are. The flashlight light is just

175
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,680
too wide which is why when setting up a stem measurement

176
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,360
I take quite a long time here running through all of these different modes

177
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,120
sort of oscillating the focus of the beam and playing all sorts of tricks

178
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,120
in order to get it focused down to a tight as spot as possible.

179
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,360
The smaller that that beam gets the better the resolution of the images that

180
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,040
I'll be able to form. And there we go now when we focus we have

181
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,920
a nice even beam. It gets really small. Still a little bit

182
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:44,040
of stig. See. And go over here to stem. Now we're

183
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,320
scanning. It's exciting. Gotta zoom out a little bit

184
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,840
and hopefully we will see the sample. There we go. Spin the scan around a

185
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,600
little bit and get it flat. So while on location Brian struggles to

186
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,520
focus and zoom in let me tell you what this sample actually is.

187
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,800
If you've watched my previous video about evaporating metals and

188
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,880
making molecular beams you may remember that our lab specializes in

189
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,040
depositing extraordinarily thin layers of crystals,

190
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,080
crystalline materials in this big vacuum chamber.

191
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,080
That means that we end up with these multi-layer sandwich kind of structures.

192
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,920
If you slice a cross-section out of one of these stacks then you get to see

193
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,760
all of the layers and find out if your process work. In this case we started

194
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,200
with a wafer of a semiconductor called gallium arsenide.

195
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Deposited an extremely thin layer of lead selenide

196
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,400
and then a reasonably thick layer of tin selenide.

197
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,520
These two layers on top are actually the weird carbon and platinum slurry that I

198
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,520
talked about in the fib video that basically just get welded to the top of

199
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,720
the stack to protect it while I get it ready for the microscope. So you can

200
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,560
mostly ignore those. But this substrate the gallium arsenide

201
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,520
that's the place with the highest structural quality

202
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,080
because we didn't make it. But that means that it's the easiest place to see

203
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,600
atoms. So now if we want to see atoms all we

204
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,520
got to do is zoom in and look at that.

205
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,520
Atoms.

206
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,360
Not very focused atoms. I'm moving diff shift. Oh wait a minute I got a line I

207
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,600
shoot I didn't reach help. Iterative. Lots of steps need to be done more than

208
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,960
once. It's getting bigger getting smaller getting smaller getting bigger

209
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,600
turning back. Man this is a bendy film piece of junk.

210
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:40,520
Who made this?

211
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,200
There we go look at that atoms. These are gallium and arsenic atoms to be

212
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,840
precise. If you're wondering how this grid of dots

213
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,120
actually corresponds to the gallium arsenide unit cell like the

214
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,960
crystalline pattern we're actually looking at it from a diagonal like

215
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,760
this. And then if all the atoms were a little

216
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,560
bit blurry there you go. So each of these fuzzy blobs is actually

217
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,760
two adjacent columns of atoms. One column of arsenics and one column of galliums.

218
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,320
So if you're not convinced by looking at all of these really fuzzy little blobs

219
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:19,560
here is a much better picture. This is probably my favorite stem picture that

220
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,160
I've ever taken and after a much longer exposure time a lot of

221
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,600
you know waiting for all the drift to go away and stuff like that and quite a

222
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,600
bit of processing in MATLAB after the fact. You can very clearly see the

223
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,240
double columns of atoms here. We call them dumbbells of gallium arsenide.

224
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,760
And in the top you'll notice that the pattern is actually different. It doesn't

225
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,720
have the dumbbells. This is lead selenide which forms a

226
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,480
completely different crystal structure. And what's happening in between

227
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,080
these two weird sort of fuzzy blobs that look like dislocations but aren't

228
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,760
really dislocations I think is really interesting.

229
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,440
But unfortunately it is outside the scope of this YouTube video.

230
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,640
So when I was filming this video I was actually looking at tin selenide which

231
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,440
is a different material. And tin selenide has layers. So I passed

232
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,200
through the gallium arsenide, the lead selenide, and now the tin

233
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,040
selenide. Let's try to find some some cool looking defects.

234
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,880
Although it appears we've lost our focus. This sample is not flat.

235
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,600
Holy mackerel. Oh I had it for a second. There we go.

236
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,360
Check it out. Atoms. In order to get a good picture of this what I actually

237
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,440
need to do is take a bunch of images and then stack them. So it's

238
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,240
microscopy. Looking at the smallest of things has a surprising overlap with

239
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,200
astrophotography where you're looking at the largest of

240
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,160
things. So right now I'm taking a sequence. So it's

241
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,200
going to take a whole bunch of pictures and you can notice that the whole frame

242
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,240
is shifting a little bit each time. So that's

243
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,840
the drift that you need to correct for. The same way that stars in the sky move

244
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,680
slowly and you need to correct for that. So tin selenide is this

245
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,800
layered structure. So you can see once we do a little bit of the

246
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,200
correction here this is two layers of atoms that are glued together and then

247
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,160
below it is two layers of atoms that are glued together and then below it are

248
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,160
two layers of atoms that are glued together. So you get this sort of

249
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,360
double layer structure going through the whole material. I'm looking for a

250
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,320
location where that layered thing gets screwed up in a very particular way

251
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,000
and that's a layer. Yeah this is not what I'm looking for. It's cool

252
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,080
it's atoms but it's not what I'm looking for.

253
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:44,680
Got a gap got a gap got a gap got a gap got a gap got a gap got a gap got a gap

254
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,000
got a gap all the way across. Okay no.

255
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,600
Possibly another hyper dislocation. I think those must be common

256
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,240
which itself would be interesting. So the actual defect I'm looking for is

257
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,840
basically a hiccup in the layered structure of the material.

258
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,040
Because each layer of tin cellonite is two atoms tall, and because of some weird stuff

259
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,080
happening at the interface, we expected that it was possible to get one region of the crystal

260
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,440
shifted with respect to the rest.

261
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,880
And in particular, we thought this shift might only be one atom tall, which would actually

262
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,320
be half of a layer, meaning that the top of one layer was bonded to the bottom of the

263
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,360
next layer and so on, creating this weird zipper structure at the boundary.

264
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:31,160
Unfortunately, even if the sample is chock-full of these, getting one lined up in a place

265
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:36,360
where I can photograph it requires quite a bit of luck and quite a bit of tedium.

266
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,360
God, it's an ugly picture.

267
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,360
That is absolutely what I'm looking for.

268
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:02,360
Okay, unless the tilt over here is so significant that it's making this not look like what it

269
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,360
should look like, which I guess is possible, I'm going to assume that I'm not tilted right,

270
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:15,360
and I'm going to pray that I can get back to this exact same spot later.

271
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,360
Okay, that big white dot.

272
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
It's next to that big white dot.

273
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:30,360
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

274
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,360
Yes!

275
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,360
Ah!

276
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
I got one.

277
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,360
Look at this.

278
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:51,360
That's between two layers, and then it's in the middle of a layer.

279
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:58,360
And then unfortunately, it's right next to another defect, which actually splits it apart again.

280
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,360
So this is like a two partial dislocations right here.

281
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,360
It breaks it and then it fixes it.

282
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,360
Oh, it's so cool.

283
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,360
Oh, this will be clean down here.

284
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Neat.

285
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,360
I can't tell but I'm grinning.

286
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,360
This was annoying.

287
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,360
I think this is the first time that I've ever gone out looking for a particular defect.

288
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,360
Like, I want to see this thing and wasn't sure that it existed.

289
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:42,360
This was like three hours of tedious focusing on a really old, this is like a more than a year old

290
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,360
sample that came out of the fib.

291
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,360
And it's all like warped and stuff, which means it's really difficult to focus on

292
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,360
and it kept losing focus continuously.

293
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,360
But I did it.

294
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:00,360
So now I get to say, in a paper, that this defect exists in tinselinite because I have a picture of it.

295
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
That is science.
