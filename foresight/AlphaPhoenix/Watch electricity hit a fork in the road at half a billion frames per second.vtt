00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
Quick editor's note, the video you're about to watch

00:02.240 --> 00:05.080
is based on info from these three videos.

00:05.080 --> 00:07.040
One, where I slow down electricity

00:07.040 --> 00:09.000
and show that it's linked to the speed of light.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.600
A second one, where I show that electricity

00:11.600 --> 00:13.760
prefers to flow through connected wires

00:13.760 --> 00:16.600
and not disconnected wires to solve the maze.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.960
And a third one, where I try to provide an intuition

00:19.960 --> 00:21.520
for voltage current and resistance

00:21.520 --> 00:24.080
using a lot of different analogies,

00:24.080 --> 00:26.360
most notably a narrow trough of water.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.120
You don't need to have watched these videos

00:28.120 --> 00:29.880
to see this one, but if you wanna learn more,

00:29.880 --> 00:30.920
they exist.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.960
Here, I have a very uninteresting circuit,

00:32.960 --> 00:34.920
but it's gonna get a lot more interesting

00:34.920 --> 00:37.720
when recorded at ridiculously high speed.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.000
Over here, we have a battery.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.680
This is just a regular nine volt battery,

00:40.680 --> 00:42.360
although this one's mostly dead.

00:42.360 --> 00:43.960
And although it's not plugged in yet,

00:43.960 --> 00:45.440
this is our power supply.

00:45.440 --> 00:49.320
Over here on the left, we see that the wire splits in two.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.360
The electricity from the battery could take this branch

00:52.360 --> 00:54.720
where it would meet disconnected wires,

00:54.720 --> 00:56.760
or it could take this branch

00:56.760 --> 00:58.840
where I've soldered the wires together.

00:58.840 --> 01:01.160
Cementry level electrical engineering tells us

01:01.160 --> 01:03.520
that of course the electric current is going to flow

01:03.520 --> 01:04.640
through the connected wires

01:04.640 --> 01:06.840
and not flow through the disconnected wires.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.640
That means we're actually going to have

01:08.640 --> 01:10.640
a loop of electrons moving.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.680
They're going to be heading away from the battery

01:12.680 --> 01:16.600
in the black wire, rounding the corner at this solder joint,

01:16.600 --> 01:18.200
and then heading towards the battery

01:18.200 --> 01:19.640
everywhere in the red wire.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.920
Over here, where the wires are disconnected,

01:21.920 --> 01:23.520
there are still electrons in the wire,

01:23.520 --> 01:24.780
but none of them should be moving

01:24.780 --> 01:26.520
because they can't go anywhere.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.160
The question I want to ask you is, how do they know?

01:29.160 --> 01:31.240
Like, if I plug in this battery over here,

01:31.240 --> 01:33.840
all of a sudden, electrons are going to start, you know,

01:33.840 --> 01:35.600
chugging their way through this wire,

01:35.600 --> 01:39.080
but we know from Ohm's law that the battery voltage

01:39.080 --> 01:40.520
and the resistance of the wire

01:40.520 --> 01:43.360
should cause a very specific number of electrons

01:43.360 --> 01:45.520
to be flowing through this loop every second.

01:45.520 --> 01:47.480
The instance I connect this battery,

01:47.480 --> 01:50.120
the other end of the circuit is a meter away.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.680
Information traveling at the speed of light

01:52.680 --> 01:55.880
takes more than three nanoseconds to traverse this setup,

01:55.920 --> 01:57.880
which means that when I plug in this battery

01:57.880 --> 02:00.000
and the battery sort of asks the universe,

02:00.000 --> 02:01.920
you know, how many electrons should I pump

02:01.920 --> 02:03.760
into the black wire every second?

02:03.760 --> 02:07.320
It takes more than six nanoseconds for it to get a reply.

02:07.320 --> 02:09.080
So what do you think is going to happen?

02:09.080 --> 02:11.240
Based on comments that I've gotten on other videos,

02:11.240 --> 02:13.040
here are four possible answers.

02:13.040 --> 02:17.160
Option A, the electric field has already solved the circuit.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.080
As soon as the battery is connected,

02:19.080 --> 02:20.680
the correct amount of current will flow

02:20.680 --> 02:21.880
through the connected branch,

02:21.880 --> 02:25.080
and no current will flow down the disconnected branch.

02:25.080 --> 02:29.080
Option B, the electric field has already solved the circuit,

02:29.080 --> 02:31.280
but it still has to update information

02:31.280 --> 02:32.400
at the speed of light.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.240
So as soon as you connect the battery,

02:34.240 --> 02:36.680
the correct current starts to flow in the wires

02:36.680 --> 02:39.520
in a sort of bubble that expands from the connection point.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.160
Option C, the battery pumps an arbitrary amount

02:42.160 --> 02:43.400
of current into the wire,

02:43.400 --> 02:45.560
and despite one branch being disconnected,

02:45.560 --> 02:47.160
the current that's flowing splits

02:47.160 --> 02:49.840
when it gets to the fork and goes down both wires.

02:49.840 --> 02:51.680
Although this is initially wrong,

02:51.680 --> 02:53.600
it eventually stabilizes.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.720
Option D, initially, nothing happens.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.560
The battery updates the electric field at the speed of light,

02:59.560 --> 03:01.320
and once information has returned

03:01.320 --> 03:02.880
from the other end of the circuit,

03:02.880 --> 03:04.920
the correct amount of current starts to flow

03:04.920 --> 03:06.840
in the connected leg all at once.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.520
In this video, we're actually going to be able to record

03:09.520 --> 03:10.920
a circuit like this fast enough

03:10.920 --> 03:13.120
to differentiate between these four options.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.200
So think about it for a minute, make your guess,

03:15.200 --> 03:17.960
and drop it in the comments while the title card plays.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.680
Are you thinking about it?

03:20.680 --> 03:25.680
I'm going to come back to this in more detail

03:25.680 --> 03:26.920
at the end of the video,

03:26.920 --> 03:29.640
but I wanted to give you something else to think about now.

03:29.640 --> 03:33.280
This is the branching circuit replicated using my favorite,

03:33.280 --> 03:35.560
the water channel model for electricity.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.200
Do you think that electricity

03:37.200 --> 03:40.240
is the only way to get rid of the water channel?

03:40.240 --> 03:42.440
Well, I think that's the only way.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.000
I'm going to go back to this in more detail

03:44.000 --> 03:45.120
at the end of the video,

03:45.120 --> 03:47.560
but I wanted to give you something else to think about now.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.080
I think that electrons in the wire

03:49.080 --> 03:51.840
will do the same thing as the water in this mock-up,

03:51.840 --> 03:53.880
despite the fact that flipping a switch

03:53.880 --> 03:55.880
is a much more dynamic system

03:55.880 --> 03:57.880
than the water model was meant to handle.

03:57.880 --> 04:00.160
You're allowed to update your guess once more

04:00.160 --> 04:02.600
before I show the real circuit in motion.

04:02.600 --> 04:06.200
Unfortunately, observing electrons moving through wires

04:06.200 --> 04:08.000
is obscenely difficult,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.200
and I think that this is one of the reasons

04:10.200 --> 04:12.520
that electricity is so hard to learn about.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.720
I didn't properly understand the concept of line impedance,

04:15.720 --> 04:18.720
for example, until I had built the apparatus

04:18.720 --> 04:21.160
that I planned to use for this video

04:21.160 --> 04:23.520
and used it to watch waves of electricity

04:23.520 --> 04:25.120
traveling around in wires.

04:25.120 --> 04:28.000
A regular camera, like the one on your phone,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.200
can't see electron motion,

04:30.200 --> 04:31.480
and even if it could,

04:31.480 --> 04:34.880
the changes occur on the order of the speed of light.

04:34.880 --> 04:38.040
For reference, this is a recent video from the Slow Mo Guys,

04:38.040 --> 04:40.560
taken at 82,000 frames per second.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.160
That sounds really fast,

04:42.160 --> 04:45.200
but in between each frame of this video,

04:45.200 --> 04:49.440
light can travel more than two miles, 3.5 kilometers.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.000
Since electricity,

04:51.000 --> 04:54.120
as in the signals and energy delivered by electric current,

04:54.120 --> 04:56.440
travels anywhere between the speed of light

04:56.440 --> 04:58.480
and maybe half the speed of light,

04:58.480 --> 05:02.440
we clearly can't use a regular high-speed camera

05:02.440 --> 05:05.400
to observe changes in a tabletop circuit model

05:05.400 --> 05:07.080
that's only a few meters long.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.160
In fact, we're going to need to cheat even more

05:10.160 --> 05:13.160
with slower electricity and longer wires.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.000
I'm sorry for the really weird camera angle

05:15.000 --> 05:15.840
for these shots,

05:15.840 --> 05:17.960
but this literally takes up the entire room

05:17.960 --> 05:19.560
and I can only set it up on the floor

05:19.560 --> 05:21.040
unless I set it up outside.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.360
So this is what we've got.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.000
I did try a whole bunch of methods

05:24.000 --> 05:26.440
to create extra slow transmission lines,

05:26.440 --> 05:28.880
but I ended up with this homemade twisted pair

05:28.880 --> 05:31.480
in which electricity travels at about 60%

05:31.480 --> 05:32.400
the speed of light.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.960
But since that's still too fast,

05:33.960 --> 05:36.440
I made a lot of this twisted pair,

05:36.440 --> 05:39.640
and I ended up zigzagging it onto these wooden frames,

05:39.640 --> 05:42.680
each of which holds about 23 meters of cable.

05:42.680 --> 05:44.400
I'll get to some of that decision-making later,

05:44.400 --> 05:46.360
like why I have this twisted pair

05:46.360 --> 05:48.680
and why my scope probes look like this.

05:48.680 --> 05:52.440
But for now, we have a larger and slower version

05:52.440 --> 05:54.060
of the circuit from the intro.

05:54.060 --> 05:56.160
At the top here, at the start of the circuit,

05:56.160 --> 05:58.360
we literally just have a nine-volt battery,

05:58.360 --> 06:00.960
and that nine-volt battery gets plugged into this circuit,

06:00.960 --> 06:02.620
which is an electronic switch,

06:02.620 --> 06:05.880
which is basically just able to plug the battery in

06:05.880 --> 06:07.960
faster than I would be able to.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.800
After that, it goes into this cable, this twisted pair,

06:11.800 --> 06:14.360
which goes zigzagging, zigzagging, zigzagging

06:14.360 --> 06:16.880
for 23 meters into this Y,

06:16.880 --> 06:18.560
where we have three cables connected,

06:18.560 --> 06:22.440
and then it goes zigzagging, zigzagging over here

06:22.440 --> 06:25.520
to an open circuit where the two wires are disconnected,

06:25.520 --> 06:29.000
and it goes zigzagging, zigzagging, zigzagging to here

06:29.000 --> 06:30.920
where the wires are connected,

06:30.920 --> 06:33.520
which means that after this battery is plugged in,

06:33.520 --> 06:36.400
we should have electric current flowing through these wires

06:36.400 --> 06:38.480
and electric current flowing through these wires

06:38.480 --> 06:39.960
where they're shorted together.

06:39.960 --> 06:44.160
But we should not have any electricity flowing over here

06:44.160 --> 06:45.560
where the wires are disconnected.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.920
These are basically just attached,

06:47.920 --> 06:49.400
but they don't really do anything.

06:49.400 --> 06:52.360
Now, the round trip time at the speed of electricity

06:52.360 --> 06:54.160
is about 500 nanoseconds.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.560
When I plug in this battery,

06:55.560 --> 06:57.240
or when this circuit plugs in this battery

06:57.240 --> 06:58.240
really, really quickly,

06:58.240 --> 07:00.860
it takes about 500 nanoseconds for that information

07:00.860 --> 07:03.200
to make it all the way to both ends of the cable

07:03.200 --> 07:04.320
and come back.

07:04.320 --> 07:06.640
That's slow enough that we should actually

07:06.640 --> 07:07.800
be able to measure it.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.680
The most common tool for analyzing very fast changes

07:10.680 --> 07:13.160
in electronic circuits is called an oscilloscope.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.040
I have one right here.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.320
We're gonna use it in a minute.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.480
But in general, I find oscilloscopes

07:17.480 --> 07:20.240
and analysis of circuits with oscilloscopes

07:20.240 --> 07:21.640
to be very, very limiting.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.360
An oscilloscope is basically a voltmeter

07:24.360 --> 07:26.560
combined with a really accurate clock,

07:26.560 --> 07:28.800
and it will draw you a plot

07:28.800 --> 07:32.300
of how the voltage on a wire changes over time.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.120
For example, what if I wanted to know

07:34.120 --> 07:36.240
exactly how fast this switch is?

07:36.240 --> 07:37.840
When you plug in the battery,

07:37.840 --> 07:39.840
how quickly does the voltage on the wire

07:39.840 --> 07:41.840
go from zero to maximum?

07:41.840 --> 07:44.360
So on this plot, the x-axis is time,

07:44.360 --> 07:46.760
and the y-axis is voltage.

07:46.760 --> 07:48.200
So when we plug in the battery,

07:48.200 --> 07:51.440
we can see that the voltage goes from zero to high

07:51.440 --> 07:53.920
in a very, very short span of time.

07:53.920 --> 07:57.100
This whole event takes less than 10 nanoseconds.

07:57.100 --> 07:59.160
This is a really fast switch.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.360
In this particular case, it gets a little weirder,

08:01.360 --> 08:02.320
because when we zoom out,

08:02.320 --> 08:04.280
we can see there's a little bit of a step right here,

08:04.280 --> 08:06.280
and then there's another step right here,

08:06.280 --> 08:08.520
and I mean, this is just sort of bizarre.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.000
Like there's a dip right there before it stabilizes,

08:11.000 --> 08:12.520
like what's actually going on?

08:12.520 --> 08:14.880
If you wanna play this back as an animation,

08:14.880 --> 08:17.400
we can imagine flipping this switch

08:17.400 --> 08:19.240
at an absurdly fast rate.

08:19.240 --> 08:22.360
The voltage at this point in the circuit spikes up,

08:22.360 --> 08:26.240
and then mystery stuff happens in the rest of the circuit,

08:26.240 --> 08:28.640
and then the voltage over here steps down a little bit,

08:28.640 --> 08:30.440
and then more mystery stuff happens

08:30.440 --> 08:31.520
in the rest of the circuit,

08:31.600 --> 08:34.880
and then the voltage steps down and ends up stabilizing.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.800
This is why I find oscilloscope traces so limiting.

08:37.800 --> 08:40.520
You can see what's happening at one location,

08:40.520 --> 08:43.440
but you can't really see everything.

08:43.440 --> 08:46.280
The trick that we can use is to probe more points

08:46.280 --> 08:48.020
on the circuit at once.

08:48.020 --> 08:49.960
If I take an extra set of scope probes,

08:49.960 --> 08:51.440
and I attach them in the middle,

08:51.440 --> 08:53.400
now we see something very interesting.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.320
The voltage at this point in the circuit

08:55.320 --> 09:00.040
doesn't rise until 116 nanoseconds later.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.720
If I measure the voltage at this point

09:01.720 --> 09:04.360
at the end where the wires are connected together,

09:04.360 --> 09:06.760
we basically see, oh man, it's very noisy.

09:06.760 --> 09:07.600
Hot, hot.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.040
Let's melt my fingers together, that'll help.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.120
If I measure the voltage at the end of the circuit

09:13.120 --> 09:15.920
that's shorted out where the wires are just soldered together,

09:15.920 --> 09:17.720
we can see on the scope that the voltage

09:17.720 --> 09:20.000
basically stays flat the whole time,

09:20.000 --> 09:23.080
but now requiring me to be completely under the table,

09:23.080 --> 09:24.880
if we measure the voltage over here,

09:24.880 --> 09:29.880
if we wait about 240 nanoseconds,

09:30.300 --> 09:32.960
then we see the voltage at this point

09:32.960 --> 09:35.920
all the way at the end of the wire start to go up.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.040
So let's run that same visualization again.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.640
When we flip this switch,

09:39.640 --> 09:41.680
we see the voltage at the switch go up,

09:41.680 --> 09:44.920
and then something happens probably in the first panel,

09:44.920 --> 09:47.260
and then we see the voltage go up in the middle,

09:47.260 --> 09:50.040
and then something happens probably in both panels,

09:50.040 --> 09:52.360
and then we see something happen in the panel

09:52.360 --> 09:53.740
with the disconnected wires,

09:53.740 --> 09:54.580
which was the panel

09:54.580 --> 09:57.020
where we didn't expect to see anything happening.

09:57.020 --> 09:58.620
Then we just start to see voltages

09:58.620 --> 09:59.940
changing all over the circuit.

09:59.940 --> 10:02.380
It's not super clear what's going on.

10:02.380 --> 10:04.460
This is why I get frustrated with the oscilloscopes

10:04.460 --> 10:05.820
as a learning tool sometimes,

10:05.820 --> 10:08.300
because you can't see the propagation.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.740
So with a couple extremely tedious hours

10:10.740 --> 10:12.820
of stripping wires with an X-Acto knife,

10:12.820 --> 10:14.820
I added taps every four feet

10:14.820 --> 10:17.660
so that I could attach probes all over the place

10:17.660 --> 10:19.860
and play them back at the same time.

10:19.860 --> 10:23.020
This ends us with something that looks like this.

10:23.940 --> 10:27.580
["Pomp and Circumstance"]

10:45.420 --> 10:47.300
If I show it in a more graphy view here,

10:47.300 --> 10:49.340
maybe some of these features get clearer.

10:49.340 --> 10:50.700
I really love this footage,

10:50.700 --> 10:53.940
and it shows that no, the battery has no idea

10:53.940 --> 10:56.300
how much current should flow when you plug it in.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.740
The battery is connected.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.380
A whole bunch of current flows down the wire.

11:00.380 --> 11:02.900
When it hits the Y, the current gets split,

11:02.900 --> 11:05.500
but also something looks like it reflects

11:05.500 --> 11:06.820
back towards the battery.

11:06.820 --> 11:07.980
That's kind of weird.

11:07.980 --> 11:09.180
And now we have a pulse,

11:09.180 --> 11:11.540
actually two identical pulses

11:11.540 --> 11:13.740
traveling down both far wires.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.980
Remember, this wire has the ends disconnected,

11:15.980 --> 11:18.340
and this wire has the ends soldered together.

11:18.340 --> 11:19.940
When the two identical pulses

11:19.940 --> 11:22.140
reach the end of their respective wires,

11:22.140 --> 11:24.140
the one that meets the disconnected circuit

11:24.140 --> 11:25.580
slams into a wall.

11:25.580 --> 11:28.420
All of that current sloshes back and piles up.

11:28.420 --> 11:31.580
The other pulse gets shorted out, drops to zero,

11:31.580 --> 11:34.660
and also sends that information back towards the battery.

11:34.660 --> 11:37.700
If I speed up here, we see over a few reflections.

11:37.700 --> 11:39.660
The battery realizes it tried to send

11:39.660 --> 11:41.540
way too much power the first time,

11:41.540 --> 11:44.140
and slowly the whole circuit settles down.

11:44.140 --> 11:46.740
Current, the actual flow of electrons,

11:46.740 --> 11:48.460
ends up following this slope

11:48.460 --> 11:50.100
as the high voltage at the battery

11:50.100 --> 11:51.740
drops to nothing at the short.

11:51.740 --> 11:53.180
And in the disconnected wire,

11:53.180 --> 11:54.740
where nothing should be happening,

11:54.740 --> 11:56.060
there isn't a slope,

11:56.060 --> 11:58.300
no voltage to make electrons move.

11:58.300 --> 12:01.420
Until the waves actually get to the ends of the wire,

12:01.420 --> 12:02.940
they look identical.

12:02.940 --> 12:05.460
Because these waves of current don't know

12:05.460 --> 12:07.700
what is at the end of their respective branches

12:07.700 --> 12:08.540
of the circuit.

12:08.540 --> 12:10.980
Once they realize what's at the end of their circuit,

12:10.980 --> 12:13.500
they transmit that information back to the battery.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.540
This branch says, whoa, I need a bit less current this way.

12:16.540 --> 12:17.620
It looks like a wall.

12:17.620 --> 12:20.180
And this one says, hey, I need more current.

12:20.180 --> 12:21.980
Make this hill a little bit steeper.

12:21.980 --> 12:23.580
When both these signals meet each other

12:23.580 --> 12:25.380
and eventually get back to the battery,

12:25.380 --> 12:26.700
there's a negotiation.

12:26.700 --> 12:29.780
And it requires a lot of back and forth communication.

12:29.780 --> 12:31.340
In this case, the whole circuit took

12:31.340 --> 12:34.100
about 4,000 nanoseconds to stabilize.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.140
That's like eight round trips.

12:36.140 --> 12:38.060
I also wanna point out that these wires

12:38.060 --> 12:40.100
can't talk to each other through this gap.

12:40.100 --> 12:42.140
I just wanted to make it easy to compare the waves

12:42.140 --> 12:43.620
by putting them side by side.

12:43.620 --> 12:45.660
So for those of you keeping score at home,

12:45.660 --> 12:47.020
the answer is C.

12:47.020 --> 12:51.340
It takes much longer than one round trip for electricity,

12:51.340 --> 12:52.700
for the current to stabilize,

12:52.700 --> 12:55.620
and for the circuit to obey Olm's law in DC.

12:55.620 --> 12:57.340
But that leaves us with a few more questions.

12:57.340 --> 12:59.580
Like what are these waves that are traveling

12:59.580 --> 13:00.620
through this circuit?

13:00.620 --> 13:04.540
And how does the battery and switch assembly here

13:04.540 --> 13:08.500
decide how much current should initially flow in the wire

13:08.500 --> 13:10.300
if it's just guessing and it doesn't know

13:10.300 --> 13:12.620
how much current should flow to either end?

13:12.620 --> 13:13.660
To answer those questions,

13:13.700 --> 13:17.380
I have a similar but simpler circuit set up here.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.440
Instead of a big branching circuit

13:19.440 --> 13:22.300
with lots and lots of wire, this is just a straight shot.

13:22.300 --> 13:25.180
So I have the same very fast electronic switch

13:25.180 --> 13:27.780
that plugs the battery into the wire.

13:27.780 --> 13:31.620
And then I have 23 meters of my custom twisted pair.

13:31.620 --> 13:34.300
And at the end, two wires that are dangling free

13:34.300 --> 13:37.060
so that I can attach whatever resistor I want

13:37.060 --> 13:39.220
as a load on the end of this circuit.

13:39.220 --> 13:41.740
That basically means that we have a power supply

13:41.740 --> 13:43.800
and we have a load that are separated

13:43.800 --> 13:47.020
by hundreds of nanoseconds of delay time.

13:47.020 --> 13:48.980
It's really easy to go in here and say,

13:48.980 --> 13:50.260
I know the resistance of the wire,

13:50.260 --> 13:51.500
I know the resistance of the load,

13:51.500 --> 13:53.940
I know the resistance that's built into the power supply.

13:53.940 --> 13:56.540
And you can calculate how much current,

13:56.540 --> 13:58.420
literally how many electrons per second

13:58.420 --> 14:00.820
are going to be chugging their way through this wire.

14:00.820 --> 14:05.500
But as we just saw, the correct number of electrons

14:05.500 --> 14:08.340
don't flow the first time you hit the switch.

14:08.340 --> 14:10.820
They sort of have to bounce around and figure it out.

14:10.820 --> 14:13.700
For the first test, I'm just going to short out the end.

14:13.700 --> 14:15.540
I've soldered these two wires together.

14:15.540 --> 14:18.660
So this big long chain is terminated

14:18.660 --> 14:20.300
in a zero ohm resistor.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.500
I spent what ended up being quite a while

14:22.500 --> 14:25.380
writing a script that brings in these voltage traces

14:25.380 --> 14:27.700
and produces an exaggerated view

14:27.700 --> 14:30.300
of how the electrons actually move in the wire.

14:30.300 --> 14:31.580
So I want to be very clear,

14:31.580 --> 14:35.180
this top plot is real data that I actually collected.

14:35.180 --> 14:37.500
This is 20 individual oscilloscope traces

14:37.500 --> 14:39.780
that are all being played back at the same time.

14:39.780 --> 14:43.740
And this is a heavily exaggerated animation

14:43.740 --> 14:47.100
of the electrons motion based on that data.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.420
And then this final plot is a realistic,

14:49.420 --> 14:52.740
albeit extremely noisy graph of electron drift velocity

14:52.740 --> 14:54.860
along the wires length that we'll talk about in a minute,

14:54.860 --> 14:56.700
but it's also based on the raw data.

14:56.700 --> 14:58.900
For now, let's cover most of this up.

14:58.900 --> 15:01.620
The fundamental point in here is the speed of electricity

15:01.620 --> 15:03.380
and the speed of the electrons.

15:03.380 --> 15:05.220
And those are not the same thing.

15:05.220 --> 15:07.340
If we look at this wave traveling down the wire,

15:07.340 --> 15:09.660
we see that it travels this 23 meters

15:09.660 --> 15:11.980
in about 120 nanoseconds,

15:11.980 --> 15:16.020
which means it's traveling at almost 200,000 kilometers

15:16.020 --> 15:19.100
per second, which is like two thirds the speed of light.

15:19.100 --> 15:21.340
That is absurdly fast.

15:21.340 --> 15:23.460
However, if we look at these electrons

15:23.460 --> 15:26.420
that have started moving, they go a whole lot slower.

15:26.420 --> 15:28.440
In the graphic, the individual electrons

15:28.440 --> 15:31.020
are moving about 10 times slower than the wave.

15:31.020 --> 15:33.380
And that right there is the exaggeration

15:33.380 --> 15:36.080
because in reality, the electrons in this wire

15:36.080 --> 15:39.420
are traveling about 10 trillion times slower

15:39.420 --> 15:40.420
than the wave.

15:40.420 --> 15:43.020
But that doesn't make for a very understandable graphic.

15:43.020 --> 15:44.580
But if they were drawn out accurately,

15:44.580 --> 15:46.580
you'd never be able to see that they were scrunched

15:46.580 --> 15:48.780
in some places and more spread out in other places

15:48.780 --> 15:51.260
because the spacing just doesn't change very much.

15:51.260 --> 15:55.100
That said, it is the scrunching and spreading out

15:55.100 --> 15:57.020
of electrons in different parts of wires

15:57.020 --> 15:59.220
that causes electrons to do what they do

15:59.220 --> 16:00.660
and to flow through wires.

16:00.660 --> 16:01.860
If we look at the wires,

16:01.860 --> 16:04.020
these are the two wires of the twisted pair,

16:04.020 --> 16:06.060
although the twist really doesn't matter.

16:06.060 --> 16:08.820
When we flip the switch and this wave travels down the wire,

16:08.820 --> 16:11.100
we see that the electrons are pulled from one wire

16:11.100 --> 16:12.580
and shoved into the other.

16:12.580 --> 16:15.660
But at the end, the electrons haven't started moving yet.

16:15.660 --> 16:17.660
Any given point on this trace at the top

16:17.660 --> 16:19.740
is the voltage or potential difference

16:19.740 --> 16:22.100
between the wires of the twisted pair below.

16:22.100 --> 16:25.780
When this voltage goes up here, but is still zero over here,

16:25.780 --> 16:27.540
we're saying that in this region,

16:27.540 --> 16:30.340
there are more electrons in the wire than this wire.

16:30.340 --> 16:32.600
But at the far end, there are just as many electrons

16:32.600 --> 16:33.560
in both wires.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.420
Of course, this is about to change.

16:35.420 --> 16:37.840
As this wave reaches the end of the wire,

16:37.840 --> 16:39.600
all these electrons start moving.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.400
So in answer to our first question,

16:41.400 --> 16:43.000
what are these waves?

16:43.000 --> 16:45.560
These waves are waves of motion

16:45.560 --> 16:49.280
and waves of electron bunching and scrunching.

16:49.280 --> 16:52.000
At one instant, if there are electrons moving to the right

16:52.000 --> 16:54.360
in this part of the wire and not moving

16:54.360 --> 16:56.000
in this other part of the wire,

16:56.000 --> 16:57.940
the only way that can be happening

16:57.940 --> 17:00.320
is if the electrons in between those two regions

17:00.320 --> 17:03.360
in this part of the wire are actually getting closer together.

17:03.360 --> 17:05.160
And if we play this footage forwards,

17:05.160 --> 17:06.860
that's exactly what we see.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.860
It's a common argument in my comment section

17:08.860 --> 17:11.700
that these waves of electricity are just the electric field

17:11.700 --> 17:14.000
and that the electrons don't really move.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.300
But if that were the case,

17:15.300 --> 17:17.460
this zigzag layout wouldn't work.

17:17.460 --> 17:19.660
The electric field would cover the whole panel

17:19.660 --> 17:21.540
faster than I'd be able to measure it.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.500
These phenomena only make sense

17:23.500 --> 17:26.220
if electrons are actually scooching down the wire

17:26.220 --> 17:29.460
and bunching up, even if ever so slightly.

17:29.460 --> 17:32.340
That's why electricity follows wires and cables.

17:32.340 --> 17:35.540
It can only go where the electrons can scooch forwards.

17:35.540 --> 17:37.740
I originally had this circuit set up

17:37.740 --> 17:40.540
where the wires at the end were shorted together.

17:40.540 --> 17:43.420
So it was basically like a zero ohm resistor.

17:43.420 --> 17:44.460
But now,

17:48.460 --> 17:49.780
I've cut them apart.

17:49.780 --> 17:52.740
So there's an infinity ohm resistor right here

17:52.740 --> 17:55.660
where the two wires are just hanging free.

17:55.660 --> 17:58.260
So what do you think is going to happen in this case?

17:58.260 --> 18:01.420
There's no way for electrons to flow down the black wire

18:01.420 --> 18:02.900
all the way down to the end,

18:02.900 --> 18:05.260
somehow magically jump this gap

18:05.380 --> 18:07.340
and flow back along the red wire.

18:07.340 --> 18:10.340
But we know that when we flip this switch,

18:10.340 --> 18:11.420
we're going to have current.

18:11.420 --> 18:13.020
Electrons are going to start moving

18:13.020 --> 18:15.860
in this part of the wire the moment we flip this switch.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.580
So what's that going to look like

18:17.580 --> 18:19.540
when it gets to the end?

18:19.540 --> 18:21.860
It's going to look like this.

18:21.860 --> 18:23.200
After we flip the switch,

18:23.200 --> 18:25.260
we get the exact same step,

18:25.260 --> 18:27.220
the same wave of electricity

18:27.220 --> 18:29.260
at about two and a quarter volts of potential

18:29.260 --> 18:30.980
and about 15 milliamps of current

18:30.980 --> 18:32.860
are flowing in that part of the wire.

18:32.860 --> 18:34.940
But when that wave gets to the end,

18:34.940 --> 18:36.340
it can't go anywhere.

18:36.340 --> 18:39.180
Basically these electrons slam into the end of the wire

18:39.180 --> 18:40.500
and pile up.

18:40.500 --> 18:43.100
Now we have a big steep slope of voltage

18:43.100 --> 18:44.780
in the other direction.

18:44.780 --> 18:48.200
If the first slope accelerated electrons towards the load,

18:48.200 --> 18:51.140
this reverse slope decelerates the electrons

18:51.140 --> 18:54.360
and awesomely the magnitudes match.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.620
So all the electrons start moving,

18:56.620 --> 18:59.060
then the reflected wave perfectly cancels them out

18:59.060 --> 19:00.800
and they all stop moving.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.100
Of course it does bounce back and forth a bit more

19:03.340 --> 19:04.460
but after all that,

19:04.460 --> 19:07.980
we end up with two wires full of unmoving electrons.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.020
The fact that at the end of this animation,

19:10.020 --> 19:12.700
this extremely data driven animation,

19:12.700 --> 19:14.860
all of the electrons stop moving,

19:14.860 --> 19:16.300
like makes me so happy.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.020
The fact that the wave going one way

19:18.020 --> 19:20.420
is perfectly canceled by the wave going the other way

19:20.420 --> 19:23.620
when it hits the end of this is so cool.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.780
And that can be measured accurately enough

19:25.780 --> 19:28.340
to make an animation like this with an oscilloscope

19:28.340 --> 19:30.020
that's only a few hundred bucks.

19:30.020 --> 19:32.700
Just, I was so excited when I saw this animation

19:32.700 --> 19:33.540
for the first time.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.700
But both wires are at different potentials.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.700
There's a voltage difference between them.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.140
If you wanna get technical,

19:39.140 --> 19:41.500
we're now seeing the wires capacitance

19:41.500 --> 19:43.380
measured in charge per volt.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.460
Physically, how many charged electrons

19:45.460 --> 19:48.300
we need to add to a wire to change its voltage?

19:48.300 --> 19:50.200
This also in a roundabout way,

19:50.200 --> 19:52.020
answers our second question.

19:52.020 --> 19:55.380
In both cases, the exact same wave left from the battery

19:55.380 --> 19:56.700
because the circuit at this end

19:56.700 --> 19:58.700
didn't yet know what was at this end.

19:58.700 --> 20:01.780
And the magnitude of this wave was largely controlled

20:01.820 --> 20:03.740
by the capacitance of the wire.

20:03.740 --> 20:06.620
How many electrons can be crammed into this wire

20:06.620 --> 20:08.660
when you apply a certain voltage?

20:08.660 --> 20:10.420
Or to be linguistic about it,

20:10.420 --> 20:14.580
the wire's capacity to hold extra electrons.

20:14.580 --> 20:17.260
This value is very high for instances like this

20:17.260 --> 20:19.900
where you have nearby wires wrapped in insulation

20:19.900 --> 20:22.460
and extremely low for wires that are far apart

20:22.460 --> 20:23.860
with nothing in between.

20:23.860 --> 20:25.940
So now let's go back to the Y-shaped circuit

20:25.940 --> 20:28.480
and hopefully you'll see all these effects present

20:28.480 --> 20:30.740
in a much more complicated model.

20:30.740 --> 20:32.540
So now we understand this first bit.

20:32.540 --> 20:35.040
When we send a pulse of voltage down the wire,

20:35.040 --> 20:38.380
at the ends of the branches, the electrons aren't moving yet.

20:38.380 --> 20:40.380
But everywhere this wave has been,

20:40.380 --> 20:42.660
electrons have started moving.

20:42.660 --> 20:44.260
And at the edge of the wave,

20:44.260 --> 20:46.940
the electrons are either clumping up or spreading out.

20:46.940 --> 20:50.380
Now, when this pulse hits the fork, three things happen.

20:50.380 --> 20:52.020
Part of the wave reflects back,

20:52.020 --> 20:54.460
part of the wave continues into the connected branch,

20:54.460 --> 20:56.140
and part of the wave continues

20:56.140 --> 20:58.060
into the disconnected branch.

20:58.060 --> 21:01.860
These waves continue until they hit their respective loads,

21:01.860 --> 21:04.140
a dead short or zero ohm resistor,

21:04.140 --> 21:06.820
and an open circuit or infinity ohm resistor.

21:06.820 --> 21:08.620
Just like in the single cable test,

21:08.620 --> 21:10.980
we see the electrons that hit the open circuit

21:10.980 --> 21:14.100
pile up and reflect back, stopping all motion.

21:14.100 --> 21:17.380
And in the other branch, the wave reflects back low,

21:17.380 --> 21:21.020
actually accelerating the electrons in the wire further.

21:21.020 --> 21:23.300
This branching circuit is a dramatically

21:23.300 --> 21:24.580
more complicated system

21:24.580 --> 21:27.220
than the single cable terminated in a resistor.

21:27.220 --> 21:30.180
But hopefully you can see the same patterns in both.

21:30.180 --> 21:33.500
We can continue tracing individual reflections and waves

21:33.500 --> 21:36.260
and interactions between electrons in all of these wires

21:36.260 --> 21:38.700
and carefully predicting what will happen next.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.980
Or we can just fast forward to the end

21:40.980 --> 21:43.660
and see that all of this hardly matters

21:43.660 --> 21:46.140
because after a few hundred nanoseconds,

21:46.140 --> 21:49.580
everything settles out and we get exactly what we expect.

21:49.580 --> 21:52.520
A descending gradient from power supply to load

21:52.520 --> 21:54.300
where the DC version of ohm's law

21:54.300 --> 21:56.420
is satisfied for all locations.

21:56.420 --> 21:58.380
This is the same net result I measured

21:58.380 --> 22:01.220
in the electricity maze video, but at that scale,

22:01.220 --> 22:03.100
I wasn't able to record it fast enough

22:03.100 --> 22:04.740
to show you how it got that way.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.180
Hopefully now it makes a little more sense

22:07.180 --> 22:09.940
and you can imagine these waves sort of percolating

22:09.940 --> 22:13.260
through every possible way to solve that maze at once

22:13.260 --> 22:16.020
before the circuit settled into that result.

22:16.020 --> 22:18.060
At the start, I mentioned the water channel model

22:18.060 --> 22:19.180
was going to make a comeback

22:19.180 --> 22:20.940
and I wanna show you what parts

22:20.940 --> 22:23.180
of the water channel model are applicable

22:23.180 --> 22:24.900
and where you have to be careful.

22:24.900 --> 22:26.420
And then somewhere we got one down there.

22:26.420 --> 22:28.460
Is it only three leaks?

22:28.460 --> 22:30.180
It's pretty great.

22:30.180 --> 22:32.180
I recreated this circuit as best I could

22:32.180 --> 22:34.340
with acrylic sheet water channels

22:34.340 --> 22:37.740
and used large basins of water as a supply and a load.

22:37.740 --> 22:41.020
So effectively we have two capacitors connected to ground,

22:41.020 --> 22:43.700
a switch and an extra bit of wire.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.740
So check out these shots side by side.

22:45.740 --> 22:48.900
In both cases, the wave leaves from the supply,

22:48.900 --> 22:51.620
travels down the first leg, splits at the branch,

22:51.620 --> 22:53.060
sloshes up at the dead end

22:53.060 --> 22:55.740
and sloshes down at the open end.

22:55.740 --> 22:57.520
The fact that this water channel model

22:57.520 --> 23:02.520
is able to so accurately depict the dynamics of electricity,

23:02.860 --> 23:04.940
a completely different system

23:04.940 --> 23:07.380
and one that operates on time scales

23:07.380 --> 23:11.220
that are orders of magnitude faster than water.

23:11.220 --> 23:14.540
It's just really amazing to me, but it's not perfect.

23:14.540 --> 23:16.140
Weirdly in the water version,

23:16.140 --> 23:18.420
the back reflections aren't as pronounced.

23:18.420 --> 23:20.340
When the signals hit the loads at the end,

23:20.340 --> 23:22.740
we absolutely see one wave pile up

23:22.740 --> 23:24.140
and the other drop low.

23:24.140 --> 23:26.060
But in general, the dynamics of water

23:26.060 --> 23:27.260
are a little more direct

23:27.260 --> 23:29.620
and the signals returning to the power supply

23:29.620 --> 23:30.820
aren't as obvious.

23:30.820 --> 23:33.100
One reason for this may be that the parameters

23:33.100 --> 23:34.580
of the circuits don't match.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.580
If I repeat the electricity experiment

23:36.580 --> 23:40.580
with higher resistance wire, not impedance but resistance,

23:40.580 --> 23:42.620
we get a slightly closer analog

23:42.620 --> 23:44.540
where the reflections of electricity

23:44.540 --> 23:45.980
are significantly diminished.

23:45.980 --> 23:47.580
But while water in a narrow channel

23:47.580 --> 23:51.160
and electrons in a wire do show a lot of similarities,

23:51.160 --> 23:54.040
like seriously, I can keep listing them for 40 minutes,

23:54.040 --> 23:56.400
inertia is something that's really finicky.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.040
If you look at this model from above,

23:58.040 --> 23:59.880
you can see that it's not symmetrical

23:59.880 --> 24:01.600
and neither is it straight.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.200
The way that water maintains inertia around corners

24:04.200 --> 24:06.240
is extremely different from electrons,

24:06.240 --> 24:08.520
which pick up an effective inertia while drifting

24:08.520 --> 24:11.040
by creating a magnetic field around the wire.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.560
This divot, for example,

24:12.560 --> 24:15.960
would never appear in electron flow in a wire.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.080
And at the end, I wasn't able to create

24:18.120 --> 24:21.200
a perfect low voltage supply to pull the signal down,

24:21.200 --> 24:23.640
but this is something that's really easy in wires.

24:23.640 --> 24:27.280
I always imagine circuits, even dynamic ones with waves,

24:27.280 --> 24:29.560
like water flowing through these channels.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.960
But sometimes the mental image

24:31.960 --> 24:34.280
with the idealized water flowing down

24:34.280 --> 24:39.000
an idealized water trough is a better analog to electricity

24:39.000 --> 24:41.920
than building one in real life and filming it in real life.

24:41.920 --> 24:45.360
However, even this real one with all of its imperfections

24:45.360 --> 24:47.680
is an excellent qualitative model

24:47.680 --> 24:50.040
that I think provides a lot of intuition

24:50.040 --> 24:52.480
for an otherwise very difficult topic.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.840
Of course, what actually happens in my head

24:54.840 --> 24:56.760
is that when this doesn't match,

24:56.760 --> 24:59.720
I start thinking of a more complicated electronic circuit

24:59.720 --> 25:01.320
that would match this better.

25:01.320 --> 25:04.080
Like this milk jug at the end is basically a capacitor

25:04.080 --> 25:05.560
and the fact that I've cut it off

25:05.560 --> 25:07.960
makes it a voltage regulator.

25:07.960 --> 25:10.600
And it's a lot better than basically what I had before

25:10.600 --> 25:13.040
was like a voltage sensitive resistor

25:13.040 --> 25:14.520
where I just ended it.

25:14.520 --> 25:16.360
Anyway, I hope that you learned something

25:16.360 --> 25:18.200
about electricity watching this video.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.360
I certainly learned a lot about electricity

25:20.360 --> 25:22.880
making this video and had a lot of fun

25:22.880 --> 25:25.160
trying to figure out how to film electricity

25:25.160 --> 25:26.600
at a ridiculous speed

25:26.600 --> 25:30.400
and making the equivalent water model to think about.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.560
I feel like I'm completely incapable

25:32.560 --> 25:34.320
of writing a short script anymore.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.520
There was an awful lot that got cut from this video,

25:37.520 --> 25:41.200
especially a more mathematical view of this circuit

25:41.200 --> 25:42.760
and how you can actually calculate

25:42.760 --> 25:44.200
the strengths of these waves

25:44.200 --> 25:46.000
and a lot more with the single cable

25:46.040 --> 25:47.960
that was terminated with various resistors.

25:47.960 --> 25:51.040
So that all ended up becoming another video.

25:51.040 --> 25:53.360
You should head over to Alpha Phoenix 2

25:53.360 --> 25:57.000
where I have the Q and A from my previous mainline video

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
posted along with another few short videos

26:00.000 --> 26:01.400
that I think you'll enjoy.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.320
Thanks for watching.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.240
See you next time.

26:03.240 --> 26:04.800
Bye.
