0	2240	Quick editor's note, the video you're about to watch
2240	5080	is based on info from these three videos.
5080	7040	One, where I slow down electricity
7040	9000	and show that it's linked to the speed of light.
9000	11600	A second one, where I show that electricity
11600	13760	prefers to flow through connected wires
13760	16600	and not disconnected wires to solve the maze.
16600	19960	And a third one, where I try to provide an intuition
19960	21520	for voltage current and resistance
21520	24080	using a lot of different analogies,
24080	26360	most notably a narrow trough of water.
26360	28120	You don't need to have watched these videos
28120	29880	to see this one, but if you wanna learn more,
29880	30920	they exist.
30920	32960	Here, I have a very uninteresting circuit,
32960	34920	but it's gonna get a lot more interesting
34920	37720	when recorded at ridiculously high speed.
37720	39000	Over here, we have a battery.
39000	40680	This is just a regular nine volt battery,
40680	42360	although this one's mostly dead.
42360	43960	And although it's not plugged in yet,
43960	45440	this is our power supply.
45440	49320	Over here on the left, we see that the wire splits in two.
49320	52360	The electricity from the battery could take this branch
52360	54720	where it would meet disconnected wires,
54720	56760	or it could take this branch
56760	58840	where I've soldered the wires together.
58840	61160	Cementry level electrical engineering tells us
61160	63520	that of course the electric current is going to flow
63520	64640	through the connected wires
64640	66840	and not flow through the disconnected wires.
66840	68640	That means we're actually going to have
68640	70640	a loop of electrons moving.
70640	72680	They're going to be heading away from the battery
72680	76600	in the black wire, rounding the corner at this solder joint,
76600	78200	and then heading towards the battery
78200	79640	everywhere in the red wire.
79640	81920	Over here, where the wires are disconnected,
81920	83520	there are still electrons in the wire,
83520	84780	but none of them should be moving
84780	86520	because they can't go anywhere.
86520	89160	The question I want to ask you is, how do they know?
89160	91240	Like, if I plug in this battery over here,
91240	93840	all of a sudden, electrons are going to start, you know,
93840	95600	chugging their way through this wire,
95600	99080	but we know from Ohm's law that the battery voltage
99080	100520	and the resistance of the wire
100520	103360	should cause a very specific number of electrons
103360	105520	to be flowing through this loop every second.
105520	107480	The instance I connect this battery,
107480	110120	the other end of the circuit is a meter away.
110120	112680	Information traveling at the speed of light
112680	115880	takes more than three nanoseconds to traverse this setup,
115920	117880	which means that when I plug in this battery
117880	120000	and the battery sort of asks the universe,
120000	121920	you know, how many electrons should I pump
121920	123760	into the black wire every second?
123760	127320	It takes more than six nanoseconds for it to get a reply.
127320	129080	So what do you think is going to happen?
129080	131240	Based on comments that I've gotten on other videos,
131240	133040	here are four possible answers.
133040	137160	Option A, the electric field has already solved the circuit.
137160	139080	As soon as the battery is connected,
139080	140680	the correct amount of current will flow
140680	141880	through the connected branch,
141880	145080	and no current will flow down the disconnected branch.
145080	149080	Option B, the electric field has already solved the circuit,
149080	151280	but it still has to update information
151280	152400	at the speed of light.
152400	154240	So as soon as you connect the battery,
154240	156680	the correct current starts to flow in the wires
156680	159520	in a sort of bubble that expands from the connection point.
159520	162160	Option C, the battery pumps an arbitrary amount
162160	163400	of current into the wire,
163400	165560	and despite one branch being disconnected,
165560	167160	the current that's flowing splits
167160	169840	when it gets to the fork and goes down both wires.
169840	171680	Although this is initially wrong,
171680	173600	it eventually stabilizes.
173600	176720	Option D, initially, nothing happens.
176720	179560	The battery updates the electric field at the speed of light,
179560	181320	and once information has returned
181320	182880	from the other end of the circuit,
182880	184920	the correct amount of current starts to flow
184920	186840	in the connected leg all at once.
186840	189520	In this video, we're actually going to be able to record
189520	190920	a circuit like this fast enough
190920	193120	to differentiate between these four options.
193120	195200	So think about it for a minute, make your guess,
195200	197960	and drop it in the comments while the title card plays.
198800	200680	Are you thinking about it?
200680	205680	I'm going to come back to this in more detail
205680	206920	at the end of the video,
206920	209640	but I wanted to give you something else to think about now.
209640	213280	This is the branching circuit replicated using my favorite,
213280	215560	the water channel model for electricity.
215560	217200	Do you think that electricity
217200	220240	is the only way to get rid of the water channel?
220240	222440	Well, I think that's the only way.
222440	224000	I'm going to go back to this in more detail
224000	225120	at the end of the video,
225120	227560	but I wanted to give you something else to think about now.
227560	229080	I think that electrons in the wire
229080	231840	will do the same thing as the water in this mock-up,
231840	233880	despite the fact that flipping a switch
233880	235880	is a much more dynamic system
235880	237880	than the water model was meant to handle.
237880	240160	You're allowed to update your guess once more
240160	242600	before I show the real circuit in motion.
242600	246200	Unfortunately, observing electrons moving through wires
246200	248000	is obscenely difficult,
248000	250200	and I think that this is one of the reasons
250200	252520	that electricity is so hard to learn about.
252520	255720	I didn't properly understand the concept of line impedance,
255720	258720	for example, until I had built the apparatus
258720	261160	that I planned to use for this video
261160	263520	and used it to watch waves of electricity
263520	265120	traveling around in wires.
265120	268000	A regular camera, like the one on your phone,
268000	270200	can't see electron motion,
270200	271480	and even if it could,
271480	274880	the changes occur on the order of the speed of light.
274880	278040	For reference, this is a recent video from the Slow Mo Guys,
278040	280560	taken at 82,000 frames per second.
280560	282160	That sounds really fast,
282160	285200	but in between each frame of this video,
285200	289440	light can travel more than two miles, 3.5 kilometers.
289440	291000	Since electricity,
291000	294120	as in the signals and energy delivered by electric current,
294120	296440	travels anywhere between the speed of light
296440	298480	and maybe half the speed of light,
298480	302440	we clearly can't use a regular high-speed camera
302440	305400	to observe changes in a tabletop circuit model
305400	307080	that's only a few meters long.
307080	310160	In fact, we're going to need to cheat even more
310160	313160	with slower electricity and longer wires.
313160	315000	I'm sorry for the really weird camera angle
315000	315840	for these shots,
315840	317960	but this literally takes up the entire room
317960	319560	and I can only set it up on the floor
319560	321040	unless I set it up outside.
321040	322360	So this is what we've got.
322360	324000	I did try a whole bunch of methods
324000	326440	to create extra slow transmission lines,
326440	328880	but I ended up with this homemade twisted pair
328880	331480	in which electricity travels at about 60%
331480	332400	the speed of light.
332400	333960	But since that's still too fast,
333960	336440	I made a lot of this twisted pair,
336440	339640	and I ended up zigzagging it onto these wooden frames,
339640	342680	each of which holds about 23 meters of cable.
342680	344400	I'll get to some of that decision-making later,
344400	346360	like why I have this twisted pair
346360	348680	and why my scope probes look like this.
348680	352440	But for now, we have a larger and slower version
352440	354060	of the circuit from the intro.
354060	356160	At the top here, at the start of the circuit,
356160	358360	we literally just have a nine-volt battery,
358360	360960	and that nine-volt battery gets plugged into this circuit,
360960	362620	which is an electronic switch,
362620	365880	which is basically just able to plug the battery in
365880	367960	faster than I would be able to.
367960	371800	After that, it goes into this cable, this twisted pair,
371800	374360	which goes zigzagging, zigzagging, zigzagging
374360	376880	for 23 meters into this Y,
376880	378560	where we have three cables connected,
378560	382440	and then it goes zigzagging, zigzagging over here
382440	385520	to an open circuit where the two wires are disconnected,
385520	389000	and it goes zigzagging, zigzagging, zigzagging to here
389000	390920	where the wires are connected,
390920	393520	which means that after this battery is plugged in,
393520	396400	we should have electric current flowing through these wires
396400	398480	and electric current flowing through these wires
398480	399960	where they're shorted together.
399960	404160	But we should not have any electricity flowing over here
404160	405560	where the wires are disconnected.
405560	407920	These are basically just attached,
407920	409400	but they don't really do anything.
409400	412360	Now, the round trip time at the speed of electricity
412360	414160	is about 500 nanoseconds.
414160	415560	When I plug in this battery,
415560	417240	or when this circuit plugs in this battery
417240	418240	really, really quickly,
418240	420860	it takes about 500 nanoseconds for that information
420860	423200	to make it all the way to both ends of the cable
423200	424320	and come back.
424320	426640	That's slow enough that we should actually
426640	427800	be able to measure it.
427800	430680	The most common tool for analyzing very fast changes
430680	433160	in electronic circuits is called an oscilloscope.
433160	434040	I have one right here.
434040	435320	We're gonna use it in a minute.
435320	437480	But in general, I find oscilloscopes
437480	440240	and analysis of circuits with oscilloscopes
440240	441640	to be very, very limiting.
441640	444360	An oscilloscope is basically a voltmeter
444360	446560	combined with a really accurate clock,
446560	448800	and it will draw you a plot
448800	452300	of how the voltage on a wire changes over time.
452300	454120	For example, what if I wanted to know
454120	456240	exactly how fast this switch is?
456240	457840	When you plug in the battery,
457840	459840	how quickly does the voltage on the wire
459840	461840	go from zero to maximum?
461840	464360	So on this plot, the x-axis is time,
464360	466760	and the y-axis is voltage.
466760	468200	So when we plug in the battery,
468200	471440	we can see that the voltage goes from zero to high
471440	473920	in a very, very short span of time.
473920	477100	This whole event takes less than 10 nanoseconds.
477100	479160	This is a really fast switch.
479160	481360	In this particular case, it gets a little weirder,
481360	482320	because when we zoom out,
482320	484280	we can see there's a little bit of a step right here,
484280	486280	and then there's another step right here,
486280	488520	and I mean, this is just sort of bizarre.
488520	491000	Like there's a dip right there before it stabilizes,
491000	492520	like what's actually going on?
492520	494880	If you wanna play this back as an animation,
494880	497400	we can imagine flipping this switch
497400	499240	at an absurdly fast rate.
499240	502360	The voltage at this point in the circuit spikes up,
502360	506240	and then mystery stuff happens in the rest of the circuit,
506240	508640	and then the voltage over here steps down a little bit,
508640	510440	and then more mystery stuff happens
510440	511520	in the rest of the circuit,
511600	514880	and then the voltage steps down and ends up stabilizing.
514880	517800	This is why I find oscilloscope traces so limiting.
517800	520520	You can see what's happening at one location,
520520	523440	but you can't really see everything.
523440	526280	The trick that we can use is to probe more points
526280	528020	on the circuit at once.
528020	529960	If I take an extra set of scope probes,
529960	531440	and I attach them in the middle,
531440	533400	now we see something very interesting.
533400	535320	The voltage at this point in the circuit
535320	540040	doesn't rise until 116 nanoseconds later.
540040	541720	If I measure the voltage at this point
541720	544360	at the end where the wires are connected together,
544360	546760	we basically see, oh man, it's very noisy.
546760	547600	Hot, hot.
549000	551040	Let's melt my fingers together, that'll help.
551040	553120	If I measure the voltage at the end of the circuit
553120	555920	that's shorted out where the wires are just soldered together,
555920	557720	we can see on the scope that the voltage
557720	560000	basically stays flat the whole time,
560000	563080	but now requiring me to be completely under the table,
563080	564880	if we measure the voltage over here,
564880	569880	if we wait about 240 nanoseconds,
570300	572960	then we see the voltage at this point
572960	575920	all the way at the end of the wire start to go up.
575920	578040	So let's run that same visualization again.
578040	579640	When we flip this switch,
579640	581680	we see the voltage at the switch go up,
581680	584920	and then something happens probably in the first panel,
584920	587260	and then we see the voltage go up in the middle,
587260	590040	and then something happens probably in both panels,
590040	592360	and then we see something happen in the panel
592360	593740	with the disconnected wires,
593740	594580	which was the panel
594580	597020	where we didn't expect to see anything happening.
597020	598620	Then we just start to see voltages
598620	599940	changing all over the circuit.
599940	602380	It's not super clear what's going on.
602380	604460	This is why I get frustrated with the oscilloscopes
604460	605820	as a learning tool sometimes,
605820	608300	because you can't see the propagation.
608300	610740	So with a couple extremely tedious hours
610740	612820	of stripping wires with an X-Acto knife,
612820	614820	I added taps every four feet
614820	617660	so that I could attach probes all over the place
617660	619860	and play them back at the same time.
619860	623020	This ends us with something that looks like this.
623940	627580	["Pomp and Circumstance"]
645420	647300	If I show it in a more graphy view here,
647300	649340	maybe some of these features get clearer.
649340	650700	I really love this footage,
650700	653940	and it shows that no, the battery has no idea
653940	656300	how much current should flow when you plug it in.
656300	657740	The battery is connected.
657740	660380	A whole bunch of current flows down the wire.
660380	662900	When it hits the Y, the current gets split,
662900	665500	but also something looks like it reflects
665500	666820	back towards the battery.
666820	667980	That's kind of weird.
667980	669180	And now we have a pulse,
669180	671540	actually two identical pulses
671540	673740	traveling down both far wires.
673740	675980	Remember, this wire has the ends disconnected,
675980	678340	and this wire has the ends soldered together.
678340	679940	When the two identical pulses
679940	682140	reach the end of their respective wires,
682140	684140	the one that meets the disconnected circuit
684140	685580	slams into a wall.
685580	688420	All of that current sloshes back and piles up.
688420	691580	The other pulse gets shorted out, drops to zero,
691580	694660	and also sends that information back towards the battery.
694660	697700	If I speed up here, we see over a few reflections.
697700	699660	The battery realizes it tried to send
699660	701540	way too much power the first time,
701540	704140	and slowly the whole circuit settles down.
704140	706740	Current, the actual flow of electrons,
706740	708460	ends up following this slope
708460	710100	as the high voltage at the battery
710100	711740	drops to nothing at the short.
711740	713180	And in the disconnected wire,
713180	714740	where nothing should be happening,
714740	716060	there isn't a slope,
716060	718300	no voltage to make electrons move.
718300	721420	Until the waves actually get to the ends of the wire,
721420	722940	they look identical.
722940	725460	Because these waves of current don't know
725460	727700	what is at the end of their respective branches
727700	728540	of the circuit.
728540	730980	Once they realize what's at the end of their circuit,
730980	733500	they transmit that information back to the battery.
733500	736540	This branch says, whoa, I need a bit less current this way.
736540	737620	It looks like a wall.
737620	740180	And this one says, hey, I need more current.
740180	741980	Make this hill a little bit steeper.
741980	743580	When both these signals meet each other
743580	745380	and eventually get back to the battery,
745380	746700	there's a negotiation.
746700	749780	And it requires a lot of back and forth communication.
749780	751340	In this case, the whole circuit took
751340	754100	about 4,000 nanoseconds to stabilize.
754100	756140	That's like eight round trips.
756140	758060	I also wanna point out that these wires
758060	760100	can't talk to each other through this gap.
760100	762140	I just wanted to make it easy to compare the waves
762140	763620	by putting them side by side.
763620	765660	So for those of you keeping score at home,
765660	767020	the answer is C.
767020	771340	It takes much longer than one round trip for electricity,
771340	772700	for the current to stabilize,
772700	775620	and for the circuit to obey Olm's law in DC.
775620	777340	But that leaves us with a few more questions.
777340	779580	Like what are these waves that are traveling
779580	780620	through this circuit?
780620	784540	And how does the battery and switch assembly here
784540	788500	decide how much current should initially flow in the wire
788500	790300	if it's just guessing and it doesn't know
790300	792620	how much current should flow to either end?
792620	793660	To answer those questions,
793700	797380	I have a similar but simpler circuit set up here.
797380	799440	Instead of a big branching circuit
799440	802300	with lots and lots of wire, this is just a straight shot.
802300	805180	So I have the same very fast electronic switch
805180	807780	that plugs the battery into the wire.
807780	811620	And then I have 23 meters of my custom twisted pair.
811620	814300	And at the end, two wires that are dangling free
814300	817060	so that I can attach whatever resistor I want
817060	819220	as a load on the end of this circuit.
819220	821740	That basically means that we have a power supply
821740	823800	and we have a load that are separated
823800	827020	by hundreds of nanoseconds of delay time.
827020	828980	It's really easy to go in here and say,
828980	830260	I know the resistance of the wire,
830260	831500	I know the resistance of the load,
831500	833940	I know the resistance that's built into the power supply.
833940	836540	And you can calculate how much current,
836540	838420	literally how many electrons per second
838420	840820	are going to be chugging their way through this wire.
840820	845500	But as we just saw, the correct number of electrons
845500	848340	don't flow the first time you hit the switch.
848340	850820	They sort of have to bounce around and figure it out.
850820	853700	For the first test, I'm just going to short out the end.
853700	855540	I've soldered these two wires together.
855540	858660	So this big long chain is terminated
858660	860300	in a zero ohm resistor.
860300	862500	I spent what ended up being quite a while
862500	865380	writing a script that brings in these voltage traces
865380	867700	and produces an exaggerated view
867700	870300	of how the electrons actually move in the wire.
870300	871580	So I want to be very clear,
871580	875180	this top plot is real data that I actually collected.
875180	877500	This is 20 individual oscilloscope traces
877500	879780	that are all being played back at the same time.
879780	883740	And this is a heavily exaggerated animation
883740	887100	of the electrons motion based on that data.
887100	889420	And then this final plot is a realistic,
889420	892740	albeit extremely noisy graph of electron drift velocity
892740	894860	along the wires length that we'll talk about in a minute,
894860	896700	but it's also based on the raw data.
896700	898900	For now, let's cover most of this up.
898900	901620	The fundamental point in here is the speed of electricity
901620	903380	and the speed of the electrons.
903380	905220	And those are not the same thing.
905220	907340	If we look at this wave traveling down the wire,
907340	909660	we see that it travels this 23 meters
909660	911980	in about 120 nanoseconds,
911980	916020	which means it's traveling at almost 200,000 kilometers
916020	919100	per second, which is like two thirds the speed of light.
919100	921340	That is absurdly fast.
921340	923460	However, if we look at these electrons
923460	926420	that have started moving, they go a whole lot slower.
926420	928440	In the graphic, the individual electrons
928440	931020	are moving about 10 times slower than the wave.
931020	933380	And that right there is the exaggeration
933380	936080	because in reality, the electrons in this wire
936080	939420	are traveling about 10 trillion times slower
939420	940420	than the wave.
940420	943020	But that doesn't make for a very understandable graphic.
943020	944580	But if they were drawn out accurately,
944580	946580	you'd never be able to see that they were scrunched
946580	948780	in some places and more spread out in other places
948780	951260	because the spacing just doesn't change very much.
951260	955100	That said, it is the scrunching and spreading out
955100	957020	of electrons in different parts of wires
957020	959220	that causes electrons to do what they do
959220	960660	and to flow through wires.
960660	961860	If we look at the wires,
961860	964020	these are the two wires of the twisted pair,
964020	966060	although the twist really doesn't matter.
966060	968820	When we flip the switch and this wave travels down the wire,
968820	971100	we see that the electrons are pulled from one wire
971100	972580	and shoved into the other.
972580	975660	But at the end, the electrons haven't started moving yet.
975660	977660	Any given point on this trace at the top
977660	979740	is the voltage or potential difference
979740	982100	between the wires of the twisted pair below.
982100	985780	When this voltage goes up here, but is still zero over here,
985780	987540	we're saying that in this region,
987540	990340	there are more electrons in the wire than this wire.
990340	992600	But at the far end, there are just as many electrons
992600	993560	in both wires.
993560	995420	Of course, this is about to change.
995420	997840	As this wave reaches the end of the wire,
997840	999600	all these electrons start moving.
999600	1001400	So in answer to our first question,
1001400	1003000	what are these waves?
1003000	1005560	These waves are waves of motion
1005560	1009280	and waves of electron bunching and scrunching.
1009280	1012000	At one instant, if there are electrons moving to the right
1012000	1014360	in this part of the wire and not moving
1014360	1016000	in this other part of the wire,
1016000	1017940	the only way that can be happening
1017940	1020320	is if the electrons in between those two regions
1020320	1023360	in this part of the wire are actually getting closer together.
1023360	1025160	And if we play this footage forwards,
1025160	1026860	that's exactly what we see.
1026860	1028860	It's a common argument in my comment section
1028860	1031700	that these waves of electricity are just the electric field
1031700	1034000	and that the electrons don't really move.
1034000	1035300	But if that were the case,
1035300	1037460	this zigzag layout wouldn't work.
1037460	1039660	The electric field would cover the whole panel
1039660	1041540	faster than I'd be able to measure it.
1041540	1043500	These phenomena only make sense
1043500	1046220	if electrons are actually scooching down the wire
1046220	1049460	and bunching up, even if ever so slightly.
1049460	1052340	That's why electricity follows wires and cables.
1052340	1055540	It can only go where the electrons can scooch forwards.
1055540	1057740	I originally had this circuit set up
1057740	1060540	where the wires at the end were shorted together.
1060540	1063420	So it was basically like a zero ohm resistor.
1063420	1064460	But now,
1068460	1069780	I've cut them apart.
1069780	1072740	So there's an infinity ohm resistor right here
1072740	1075660	where the two wires are just hanging free.
1075660	1078260	So what do you think is going to happen in this case?
1078260	1081420	There's no way for electrons to flow down the black wire
1081420	1082900	all the way down to the end,
1082900	1085260	somehow magically jump this gap
1085380	1087340	and flow back along the red wire.
1087340	1090340	But we know that when we flip this switch,
1090340	1091420	we're going to have current.
1091420	1093020	Electrons are going to start moving
1093020	1095860	in this part of the wire the moment we flip this switch.
1095860	1097580	So what's that going to look like
1097580	1099540	when it gets to the end?
1099540	1101860	It's going to look like this.
1101860	1103200	After we flip the switch,
1103200	1105260	we get the exact same step,
1105260	1107220	the same wave of electricity
1107220	1109260	at about two and a quarter volts of potential
1109260	1110980	and about 15 milliamps of current
1110980	1112860	are flowing in that part of the wire.
1112860	1114940	But when that wave gets to the end,
1114940	1116340	it can't go anywhere.
1116340	1119180	Basically these electrons slam into the end of the wire
1119180	1120500	and pile up.
1120500	1123100	Now we have a big steep slope of voltage
1123100	1124780	in the other direction.
1124780	1128200	If the first slope accelerated electrons towards the load,
1128200	1131140	this reverse slope decelerates the electrons
1131140	1134360	and awesomely the magnitudes match.
1134360	1136620	So all the electrons start moving,
1136620	1139060	then the reflected wave perfectly cancels them out
1139060	1140800	and they all stop moving.
1140800	1143100	Of course it does bounce back and forth a bit more
1143340	1144460	but after all that,
1144460	1147980	we end up with two wires full of unmoving electrons.
1147980	1150020	The fact that at the end of this animation,
1150020	1152700	this extremely data driven animation,
1152700	1154860	all of the electrons stop moving,
1154860	1156300	like makes me so happy.
1156300	1158020	The fact that the wave going one way
1158020	1160420	is perfectly canceled by the wave going the other way
1160420	1163620	when it hits the end of this is so cool.
1163620	1165780	And that can be measured accurately enough
1165780	1168340	to make an animation like this with an oscilloscope
1168340	1170020	that's only a few hundred bucks.
1170020	1172700	Just, I was so excited when I saw this animation
1172700	1173540	for the first time.
1173540	1175700	But both wires are at different potentials.
1175700	1177700	There's a voltage difference between them.
1177700	1179140	If you wanna get technical,
1179140	1181500	we're now seeing the wires capacitance
1181500	1183380	measured in charge per volt.
1183380	1185460	Physically, how many charged electrons
1185460	1188300	we need to add to a wire to change its voltage?
1188300	1190200	This also in a roundabout way,
1190200	1192020	answers our second question.
1192020	1195380	In both cases, the exact same wave left from the battery
1195380	1196700	because the circuit at this end
1196700	1198700	didn't yet know what was at this end.
1198700	1201780	And the magnitude of this wave was largely controlled
1201820	1203740	by the capacitance of the wire.
1203740	1206620	How many electrons can be crammed into this wire
1206620	1208660	when you apply a certain voltage?
1208660	1210420	Or to be linguistic about it,
1210420	1214580	the wire's capacity to hold extra electrons.
1214580	1217260	This value is very high for instances like this
1217260	1219900	where you have nearby wires wrapped in insulation
1219900	1222460	and extremely low for wires that are far apart
1222460	1223860	with nothing in between.
1223860	1225940	So now let's go back to the Y-shaped circuit
1225940	1228480	and hopefully you'll see all these effects present
1228480	1230740	in a much more complicated model.
1230740	1232540	So now we understand this first bit.
1232540	1235040	When we send a pulse of voltage down the wire,
1235040	1238380	at the ends of the branches, the electrons aren't moving yet.
1238380	1240380	But everywhere this wave has been,
1240380	1242660	electrons have started moving.
1242660	1244260	And at the edge of the wave,
1244260	1246940	the electrons are either clumping up or spreading out.
1246940	1250380	Now, when this pulse hits the fork, three things happen.
1250380	1252020	Part of the wave reflects back,
1252020	1254460	part of the wave continues into the connected branch,
1254460	1256140	and part of the wave continues
1256140	1258060	into the disconnected branch.
1258060	1261860	These waves continue until they hit their respective loads,
1261860	1264140	a dead short or zero ohm resistor,
1264140	1266820	and an open circuit or infinity ohm resistor.
1266820	1268620	Just like in the single cable test,
1268620	1270980	we see the electrons that hit the open circuit
1270980	1274100	pile up and reflect back, stopping all motion.
1274100	1277380	And in the other branch, the wave reflects back low,
1277380	1281020	actually accelerating the electrons in the wire further.
1281020	1283300	This branching circuit is a dramatically
1283300	1284580	more complicated system
1284580	1287220	than the single cable terminated in a resistor.
1287220	1290180	But hopefully you can see the same patterns in both.
1290180	1293500	We can continue tracing individual reflections and waves
1293500	1296260	and interactions between electrons in all of these wires
1296260	1298700	and carefully predicting what will happen next.
1298700	1300980	Or we can just fast forward to the end
1300980	1303660	and see that all of this hardly matters
1303660	1306140	because after a few hundred nanoseconds,
1306140	1309580	everything settles out and we get exactly what we expect.
1309580	1312520	A descending gradient from power supply to load
1312520	1314300	where the DC version of ohm's law
1314300	1316420	is satisfied for all locations.
1316420	1318380	This is the same net result I measured
1318380	1321220	in the electricity maze video, but at that scale,
1321220	1323100	I wasn't able to record it fast enough
1323100	1324740	to show you how it got that way.
1324740	1327180	Hopefully now it makes a little more sense
1327180	1329940	and you can imagine these waves sort of percolating
1329940	1333260	through every possible way to solve that maze at once
1333260	1336020	before the circuit settled into that result.
1336020	1338060	At the start, I mentioned the water channel model
1338060	1339180	was going to make a comeback
1339180	1340940	and I wanna show you what parts
1340940	1343180	of the water channel model are applicable
1343180	1344900	and where you have to be careful.
1344900	1346420	And then somewhere we got one down there.
1346420	1348460	Is it only three leaks?
1348460	1350180	It's pretty great.
1350180	1352180	I recreated this circuit as best I could
1352180	1354340	with acrylic sheet water channels
1354340	1357740	and used large basins of water as a supply and a load.
1357740	1361020	So effectively we have two capacitors connected to ground,
1361020	1363700	a switch and an extra bit of wire.
1363700	1365740	So check out these shots side by side.
1365740	1368900	In both cases, the wave leaves from the supply,
1368900	1371620	travels down the first leg, splits at the branch,
1371620	1373060	sloshes up at the dead end
1373060	1375740	and sloshes down at the open end.
1375740	1377520	The fact that this water channel model
1377520	1382520	is able to so accurately depict the dynamics of electricity,
1382860	1384940	a completely different system
1384940	1387380	and one that operates on time scales
1387380	1391220	that are orders of magnitude faster than water.
1391220	1394540	It's just really amazing to me, but it's not perfect.
1394540	1396140	Weirdly in the water version,
1396140	1398420	the back reflections aren't as pronounced.
1398420	1400340	When the signals hit the loads at the end,
1400340	1402740	we absolutely see one wave pile up
1402740	1404140	and the other drop low.
1404140	1406060	But in general, the dynamics of water
1406060	1407260	are a little more direct
1407260	1409620	and the signals returning to the power supply
1409620	1410820	aren't as obvious.
1410820	1413100	One reason for this may be that the parameters
1413100	1414580	of the circuits don't match.
1414580	1416580	If I repeat the electricity experiment
1416580	1420580	with higher resistance wire, not impedance but resistance,
1420580	1422620	we get a slightly closer analog
1422620	1424540	where the reflections of electricity
1424540	1425980	are significantly diminished.
1425980	1427580	But while water in a narrow channel
1427580	1431160	and electrons in a wire do show a lot of similarities,
1431160	1434040	like seriously, I can keep listing them for 40 minutes,
1434040	1436400	inertia is something that's really finicky.
1436400	1438040	If you look at this model from above,
1438040	1439880	you can see that it's not symmetrical
1439880	1441600	and neither is it straight.
1441600	1444200	The way that water maintains inertia around corners
1444200	1446240	is extremely different from electrons,
1446240	1448520	which pick up an effective inertia while drifting
1448520	1451040	by creating a magnetic field around the wire.
1451040	1452560	This divot, for example,
1452560	1455960	would never appear in electron flow in a wire.
1455960	1458080	And at the end, I wasn't able to create
1458120	1461200	a perfect low voltage supply to pull the signal down,
1461200	1463640	but this is something that's really easy in wires.
1463640	1467280	I always imagine circuits, even dynamic ones with waves,
1467280	1469560	like water flowing through these channels.
1469560	1471960	But sometimes the mental image
1471960	1474280	with the idealized water flowing down
1474280	1479000	an idealized water trough is a better analog to electricity
1479000	1481920	than building one in real life and filming it in real life.
1481920	1485360	However, even this real one with all of its imperfections
1485360	1487680	is an excellent qualitative model
1487680	1490040	that I think provides a lot of intuition
1490040	1492480	for an otherwise very difficult topic.
1492480	1494840	Of course, what actually happens in my head
1494840	1496760	is that when this doesn't match,
1496760	1499720	I start thinking of a more complicated electronic circuit
1499720	1501320	that would match this better.
1501320	1504080	Like this milk jug at the end is basically a capacitor
1504080	1505560	and the fact that I've cut it off
1505560	1507960	makes it a voltage regulator.
1507960	1510600	And it's a lot better than basically what I had before
1510600	1513040	was like a voltage sensitive resistor
1513040	1514520	where I just ended it.
1514520	1516360	Anyway, I hope that you learned something
1516360	1518200	about electricity watching this video.
1518200	1520360	I certainly learned a lot about electricity
1520360	1522880	making this video and had a lot of fun
1522880	1525160	trying to figure out how to film electricity
1525160	1526600	at a ridiculous speed
1526600	1530400	and making the equivalent water model to think about.
1530400	1532560	I feel like I'm completely incapable
1532560	1534320	of writing a short script anymore.
1534320	1537520	There was an awful lot that got cut from this video,
1537520	1541200	especially a more mathematical view of this circuit
1541200	1542760	and how you can actually calculate
1542760	1544200	the strengths of these waves
1544200	1546000	and a lot more with the single cable
1546040	1547960	that was terminated with various resistors.
1547960	1551040	So that all ended up becoming another video.
1551040	1553360	You should head over to Alpha Phoenix 2
1553360	1557000	where I have the Q and A from my previous mainline video
1557000	1560000	posted along with another few short videos
1560000	1561400	that I think you'll enjoy.
1561400	1562320	Thanks for watching.
1562320	1563240	See you next time.
1563240	1564800	Bye.
