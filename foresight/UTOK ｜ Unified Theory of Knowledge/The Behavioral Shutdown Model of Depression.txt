Welcome to this educational video on a straightforward model for understanding depression.
There's much confusion about the nature of depression and this is seen in policy debates.
Several years ago, and I'll reference a blog in my assignments to you in relationship to some
blogs to read, there was a big debate in the DSM as to whether or not they should eliminate
the bereavement exemption. The bereavement exemption is the notice that if somebody is
experiencing major depressive symptoms but have recently within the last six months at various
times had experienced the death of a loved one, then those symptoms could be accounted for in
relationship to that. The bereavement exemption raises a whole host of different issues about
fundamentally how are people conceiving of depression and that's what this video is about.
What it offers is a proposed solution for conceptualizing depression by describing
it as a state of behavioral shutdown or a little more clunky but actually in the language of the
unified theory a state of mental behavioral shutdown. What we're going to see from this is then
with the proper description of the state of being depressed, we can then divide
people and their situations into three broad logical categories of depressive reactions,
depressive disorders and depressive diseases and that will be stemming from the logic
of the structure. To give you just a little bit of background about where this is located in the
development of the unified theory is, many of you know for my first job following my graduating
from my doctorate I worked at the University of Pennsylvania with Beck and my primary responsibility
was being program director, I was project director I should say, of a major study that brought
individuals in who had recently made a suicide attempt and it was in the context of doing that
study working with Beck and his formulation of depression, working with people in psychiatry
and having sort of developed the outline of the unified theory which really happens in 1997,
this is 1999 to 2003. I really engendered on an application of the unified theory to show how
it can provide a way of understanding the core concepts and categories in psychology and psychiatry.
I wrote an article that differentiated mental diseases from mental disorders and central in
that argument or related to that argument is ways in which we conceive of the concept of depression
which as we will see is a very complicated construct and it's because we lack an overarching
frame of understanding that we struggle so much in our capacities to really categorize
this different kinds of symptom presentations that may have very different causes or
presentations. So let's talk briefly about what we mean in relationship to
depression and think some about the nature of the confusion. So in modern terms we use this word all
the time so for example somebody might say, oh this has been raining for four days and this
weather is making me depressed. What do we mean when we say that? Or perhaps more seriously,
I always felt very depressed after we lost the championship game.
When they make comments like, although he acts okay on the surface, deep down he is depressed,
she often feels depressed about her life. She suffered a major depressive episode after she
lost her job. He was hospitalized with melancholic depression, returned to that term.
What I'm going to suggest here is that there's a continuum with also some reasonable divisions.
So one division is going to be in the colloquial folk psychological use of the term depressive
reaction. So this is just an experience of a depressed mood that may last for hours or mild
frustration for a bit of time, maybe a couple of days, usually tied to a series of events that
haven't gone that well and then you just relative to your normal mood you feel discouraged, grumpy,
negative. The term is used in that way and clearly we would not want to identify these
as examples of mental illness. On the flip side or on a more severe level in terms of basic
severity or a slightly different meeting, we see individuals who struggle with depression
as a fundamental part of their life and it's tied up with their general feelings of life
satisfaction. It's tied up with their general what Zach Stein might call the nature of their
insolment, which means they're sort of how they deeply relate to their emotions, what are the
image and meaning that they have in their lives. And then finally we see sort of pervasive symptoms
that then dramatically impact somebody through and through including their overt presentation.
And so there is at some level a degree of severity with these breaks and that is a
and I think we can see that in our everyday common sense language. And what I'm going to argue is
is that a deep understanding of mental behavior, which the unified theory argues that it can provide
sets the stage then for where these this dimension of severity comes from and why we might want
to divide up this sort of if we had these six bullets into three different categories.
So there's an enormous amount of struggle basically trying to get at what we should
consider the true nature of depression to be. Is it just a normal reaction to adversity?
Is it a normal reaction to be saying marginalized or disempowered or
living on the street or losing one's job or being divorced or being lonely
and feeling that life had so much potential and that could never be realized? Is it a
psychological disorder or is it a biological disease? So these are three broad
frames of reference that are operative in everyday terms and they're also operative in
different scholarly domains or within scholarly domains that elicit debate.
So the answer of those three questions fundamentally depends on who you ask. So
if you go to biological psychiatry, many people there have a view of depression
akin to what Judd described as most people in our society no longer view depression as
a mysterious sickness of spirit or emotional weakness but rather as a disease of the brain
and an important health problem. So one frame is that depression is a disease of the brain.
There are behavioral psychologists, social workers and other mental health professionals
who basically argue this is completely erroneous that we should actually consider it to be a myth
that the depression is a disease of the brain. And argue that there are patterns of
psychological functioning. I actually have a presentation where I have six or seven more
quotes from psychologists, psychoanalysts, social workers, feminists, multicultural theorists,
indigenous psychologists who all offer particular angles on the concept. I shortened that and here
emphasize the debate because when I gave this lecture I think back in 2017, the lecture that
this slides are based on, there was much debate about the bereavement exemption. That actually
may go back a little further than 2017. I can't really recall. But anyway in the context of the
debate about the bereavement like whether or not we should eliminate the criteria which I actually
argued we should but it actually was in conjunction with a fundamental redefinition of what we meant
by the term depression is that when is depression a mental disorder and when is the reaction to
difficult life circumstances? All of these different, there are societies as well as Allen Francis I
guess actually yeah it's a lot longer in 2017 if that's actually yeah I guess it would be DSM-5.
All of these individuals weighed in with different opinions about if the depression
is clearly tied to say the death of a child and somebody is two months into a death of a child
or six months into the death of a child because that I believe the data are indicative of somebody
who loses a child that's the hardest death or most likely death to result in a complicated
bereavement that would be associated with depressive symptoms. Should we think of this
as a mental disorder? So just to continue with our frame of understanding here are a couple of
sentences statements. We actually, Mariafe, Panizio and I for her master's thesis she's a doctoral
she was a doctoral student, Ken's advisor who recently defended her dissertation this past year
on the concept of personality disorders. She was here for her psychological sciences degree
and in the context of that did with me a master's thesis, a great master's thesis that explored
practitioners beliefs about depression and asked things like on a one to seven scale what do you
endorse this statement? So do you endorse the idea of depression as a disease of the brain?
Depression is a normal reaction to an environmental stressor. Depression is caused by
maladaptive psychological patterns. If a person is grieving they should be exempted from being
diagnosed. It's a myth that depression is a disease like cancer. Given that depression is
biological in nature people are not responsible for having depression. Depression arises not from
being able to as a result of being able to not meet the socially constructed standards of the
good person. This was from a quote from a social constructionist who looks at power differential.
So we took all of these and we asked the results in a separate presentation we would we shared
all those results. The implications of how we answer this are enormous because depression
is found by the World Health Organization to be the leading cause of disability worldwide
and is one of the great major contributors to the global diverted of disease putting quotes here
not by the World Health Organization but by me because if we don't agree that depression is a
disease of the brain or a medical disease then that raises all sorts of questions. So the bottom
line here at folks is that so many areas of the social sciences humanities and
psychiatry psychology social work we have a very very central concept that has enormous
implications that then has come at or angled that in a wide variety of different domains
by a wide variety of different domains that has lots of serious implications for how we think
about these this condition and there are lots of broad so for me you know I come at this because I
fell into the rabbit hole of asking the question of what is psychology and then realized just how
fragmented the field is we do and because we don't have a frame for answering the question what is
psychology what we instead have is a fragmented pluralism of different paradigms models and ideas
that sits the stage for us to be enormously confused about things like well what is a person
how do we understand psychopathology and in this instance I apply that lens specifically
to the concept of depression and so what I'll be sharing with you now is the behavioral shutdown
model and I really want to emphasize that I'm proud of the fact that the behavioral shutdown
model is so commonsensical okay and I really want folks to sort of slap their themselves
upside the head and say well of course and why didn't I think of that and how don't we agree on
that that's what I'm actually after because and then think about how many different perspectives
that are and how serious this condition is in terms of its implications and then and that's what
a lot of what the unified theory is about is about tweaking much of what can be found in relationship
to commonsense but then doing so and putting it together in a network of ideas well that allow
for coherence to be generated coherence meaning harmony between various ideas that allows for
good sense making so what where does the behavioral shutdown model come from well it comes from the
unified theory of psychology and you know which I published the meta theoretical frame for psychology
as a metaphor theoretical frame in 2011 by meta theory I mean that if you adopt the four key ideas
that make up the unified theory that's the tree of knowledge system justification systems theory
behavioral investment theory which I will see is particularly relevant and the influence matrix
you can then assimilate and integrate the major paradigms into a coherent language system
and a theoretical system that we use together the key ideas and gives rise to a more coherent
whole my current book the problem of psychology and its solution shifts the focus from the meta
theoretical into what's called the metaphysical and the metaphysical is then focused on the actual
core concepts that draw that define the field most century what are science what is and in
particular what is behavior and mental processes and this presentation on depression relates to
that because what it does is it shows really it is really much more closely connected to a
definitional conception than it is a theoretical conception a theoretical conception is actually
more abstract and relates to underlying causes a definitional system really is about connecting
to what it is that's empirically observable and developing concepts in categories that align
with what is empirically observable at least that's that's the descriptive
metaphysics that I'm currently in the process of working out so from the perspective of the
unified theory we need to answer the question what is depression and why is it part of the human
condition and here's the answer you know depression is a state of mental behavioral shutdown okay
um what do we mean by that it's a fundamental uh uh withdrawing of psychic energy um and indeed
you actually have two uh broad systems of psychic energy an approach uh system and avoidance system
that actually reside on the levels of arousal or or inhibition uh and the connection here is
basically an approach arousal system versus a reduction in energy withdrawal system is a
fundamental distinction that what depression fundamentally is about is a shift into a withdrawal
arousal verse system bottom line is people get passive and negative as opposed to being active
and approaching and positive so the that's the idea it stems from a more general idea
which is behavioral investment theory which is the third key idea in the unified theory
and serves as the fundamental linkage between life our biological dimension of analysis
and mind the basic animals uh psychological dimension so behavioral investment theory is the
joint point then um between life and mind on the tree of knowledge it's the idea that the nervous
system in general and brain in particular evolved as a computational control center
that computes the animals actions on an energy investment value system built via natural selection
natural and behavioral selection or evolution and learning here's a picture of a bird i'll give
you an example of of um behavioral investment theory in action uh so ethologists these are
scientists who study animal behavior in the wild um were exploring crows who would grab welks which
are a little shellfish um off the beach and they would fly them over uh to an area of rocks and
drop them so they would crack the shell okay now that's a task that has this particular obvious
goal orientation to get at the fleshy meat inside the shell um and the question is well
how much energy would the birds expend and how close would that be to optimal so what you would
have there is if you didn't drop the welk shell from fire enough up it wouldn't break and so you'd
have to do it several times uh and maybe it would break a little bit but you have to drop it many
of course if you flew very very high and dropped it so that it would break every time uh the more
it would be unnecessary to say fly a hundred meters up and drop it not to mention the fact
that you potentially lose track of it so there was an optimal level that one could predict
that would yield the most breakage for the least amount of flight uh the researchers calculated that
and what they found indeed was that there was a very close correspondence uh between what they
would predict uh would be the least amount of effort to get the shells to break this is an example
of what's called optimal foraging theory which basically suggests that animals um when they're
in their natural environments that they've evolved to um will will generally have a very clear trade
off between costs and benefits and attempt to optimally maximize the calorie and nutritious
value of their foods relative to costs and risks okay in other words uh the hunting and food
acquisition is a form of behavioral investment to get a return on that investment the animal must
make necessary predictions calculations about uh affordances and costs um and that guidance system
is a way to frame uh the animal behavior and really the structure of the nervous system is
about processing information to realize relevant aspects of the environment that enable the path
of behavioral investment uh to be charted and enacted so behavioral investment theory is a
neurocognitive functionalist view of mental behavior i know that's a mouthful but neurocognitive
basically just means what you already know and that's the nervous system what does the nervous
system do it's an information processing system okay uh this gives behavioral investment theory
then gives rise to a view of the nervous system as that this is a depiction of the cognitive
aspects of neurocognitive uh neural of course being the nervous system uh aspects the fleshy
aspects the cognitive refers to the way in which information is processed how it's hierarchically
managed and stored and retrieved um and i won't go into this in any depth you can look at the
educational video on behavioral investment theory um but it is worth noting that there on the right
hand side of that diagram there are four different layers of neurocognitive processing uh of the
sensory fixed action pattern motor response layer that's basically an automatic procedural layer
that you can ground uh sort of ingrain with habits an automatic sensory motor responding
that requires very little consciousness the second layer is what we call the operant experiential
layer that's noted by the p m e and this really is the the layer of your motivational emotional
energy and this is crucial for depression because this is the layer that really gets shifted in
depression where the shift is from energizing the motivation for approach and that associated
elements of positive affectivity what you get is a shift towards a focus on avoidance of avoidance
of loss of future elements and a shift away from positive approach oriented motivation
you then have on top of that you have a deliberation system in other animals this
is all where the cortex is which mentally manipulates possible scenarios to try to chart the
best path of behavioral investment and then deliberates on that and asks to inhibit impulses
and plan accordingly that's the frontal lobe and then in humans um and then mostly located in the
left hemisphere you get a whole another layer of processing that's that language-based processing
that we see uh for those of you that are doing things like um Wexler uh assessments here you
can kind of see uh the perceptual reasoning really assesses that third layer that mental
manipulation uh via pictures and holistic processing and then verbal comprehension index
that's the linguistic comprehension and expression index and then you have processing speed and
working memory so if you're familiar with the Wexler domains you can see how they would tie in
and be able to be mapped by this diagram okay so at its core behavioral investment theory links
three big ideas together one of which is cognitive neuroscience that's the idea that the nervous
system is an information processing system that makes predictions about what's going to happen
develop schema is hierarchically arranged and functions as a computational control system
um the other is BF Skinner's operant theory which looks at the relationship between the animal
and the environment and thinks about it in terms of commerce and the operating effect of the action
an animal has in terms of what are the immediate consequences that an animal's action has and
those consequences create a behavioral selection feedback loop such as certain consequences result
in the actions being selected for and other consequences result in them being selected
against it's this behavioral selection operating on the neuro computational processes that really
blends cognitive neuroscience and behavioral science into a package and all of this is grounded
on an evolutionary formulation and that's a picture of Edward O. Wilson he studied ants and also
generated sociobiology which really explored how evolution shapes the behavioral repertoires of
animals both in terms of the ways in which they evolve across the generations and then that how
that sets up learning so you have an evolutionary cognitive neuroscience foundation is what behavioral
investment theory gets at and it highlights that there are these two broad systems one is a behavioral
activation approach system and the other is behavioral inhibition okay in the first years
we were talking about the circumplex model of affect and that emphasized that you have a positive
affect and a negative affect and an arousal and a calming down system when that's active versus
passive is a better way to say it so behavioral activation really is an energizing toward the
positive and what this does is orient toward approach goals expend energy to acquire resources
focus on the benefit side generally activates positive affect and is most obviously associated
with positive reinforcement and operance sense on the flip side you have in terms of brain locations
generally more centrally located in the left prefrontal behavioral inhibition is more oriented
towards avoidance goals which are okay things you want to get distance from costs injuries etc
they're about conserving an acquired resource the focus is on costs loss or threat negative
affects activated punishment avoidance and right prefrontal okay so fundamentally your control
system is about sort of adding gas to get the good and putting on the brakes to avoid the bad
that's the easiest way to think about this and you're constantly adding gas and and brakes
in a close felt sense and here is the basic emotive motivational framework where you have
active spend is fear to avoid active spend to approach is desire passive approach is relaxation
and passive conservice depression and what immediately you now see here remember the question
is well why is depression part of our primate system well now we have a clear options just like
why are some people have so much desire it's sort of like gosh isn't it really weird when
two people fall in love it's like all they do is talk about how great the other person is they all
very energetic they're in a positive frame of mind it's like their whole mode of mood is shifted
there must be something wrong with them the answer is no the system by design when there's an
opportunity for a pair bond that has a long-term potential commitment the system by design is
activating a particular type of affiliation with sexual energy that it that creates a particular
kind of excitable desire and that is so if excitable desire in a particular kind of opportunity
is part of the architecture then we can immediately see why the converse would be true so that when
your long love of your life leaves you and that path of opportunity is no longer there and you're
reminded of all the glory that was and now will no longer be we can immediately see why
signaling shutdown and loss and and a recognition that the path of behavioral
investment has changed dramatically and requires recalibration is part and parcel of the architecture
so the behavioral shutdown framework noting first and foremost that there is a state of
behavioral shutdown that can be activated in relationship to a pattern of behavioral investment
provides a set of clear answers and the primary purpose of the behavioral shutdown model is to
clear a clear functional model of depression so that biological psychiatrists clinical
psychologists social works and late people can have a shared framework in terms of what this thing is
and why sometimes it is appropriate to consider a normal human reaction as just part of the
architecture why it's often turns out to be a psychological disorder especially in this day
and age and why it can in certain manifestations be thought of as a biological disease so a
depressive reaction or shifts in negative mood that are adaptive responses toward loss a path of
behavioral investment that had a desired object that then is broken or absent or long lost or
most dramatically perhaps like I said a death of a child the idea that the system would recognize
that loss and need recalibration and do all sorts of different things that would result
in the logic of a depressive shutdown is apparent it's also the case that if we were to play out
especially in our modern world and I keep saying that I'm not going to get into too much details
but there are a lot of reasons why a depressive reaction in the ancient world or in a hunter
gatherer society might elicit a very different kind of reaction from the social environment
the physical environment etc that would minimize it whereas in the modern environment particular
kinds of chronic stress states and particular kinds of social relations particular kinds of
beliefs about negative mood all potentially set the stage for a vicious cycle a vicious cycle
ensues when the negative reactions negative feelings are followed by negative reactions
either by the person or by others in a way that engenders more and more negative feelings and more
and more negative reactions this is a vicious psychological pattern maladaptive where shutdown
leads to more problems finally there are the argument that there would be depressive diseases
that arise out of some kind of malfunctioning neurobiological state or a state whereby the
depressive shutdown is so pervasive that it overrides other systems that are designed to
counterbalance it so the behavioral shutdown model immediately then allows us to see why
there would be these three domains so the answer of what is depression is yes it is a normal human
reaction and part of human nature yes it certainly can be a psychological disorder and yes it can be
a biological disease the issue then is now we have the concept it's a state of mental behavioral
shutdown but now the issue is well yeah what is led up what's the developmental what are the driving
features of the shutdown and then we can functionally think of well you know what's put it in
its functional awareness and response category meaning okay what is the depression in response to
a depressive reaction might function to diminish behavioral investment in productive avenues
signal loss of resources the need to reevaluate communicate need of assistance
extort demands and others facilitate submission and problematic competition
diminish problematic grandiosity you can also think about it as an inevitable state and complete
absence of productive avenues of investment that an individual then is particularly focused
on preserving what little they have defending against risk and avoiding unnecessary losses
a depression as a psychological disorder is when the depressive reaction then generates
a maladaptive response so initially triggered by danger loss and effectiveness stress but now we
get a reaction that causes more difficulties regarding a more depressive reaction resulting
more difficulties anybody that's familiar with my formulation of a neurotic loop which is the
intracyclic formulation of a portion of an individual who's very disappointed with their
shutdown doesn't know what to do about it tries to control it tries to blame themselves and we
can also think about this in relationship to the social environment where somebody who begins to get
depressed is then seen as kind of a drag kind of a downer not a lot of fun what's wrong with you
this would then both of these would create maladaptive patterns and we see a cycle where thoughts
feelings acting and relating all drive the individual into a dead end however there's nothing
here that we would look at at the physiological level and say oh there's a broken biological
system that's there's a chemical imbalance or any indication but rather the pattern simply is
maladaptive it's an entrenched maladaptive pattern that results in a vicious cycle of shutdown
as opposed to anything that would require like a physical or even the notion that there would be a
biological shift okay and again because of the current mismatch of our current environment
relative to the environment we involved in there's a lot of reasons as to why strong depressive
reactions may well be maladaptive and then finally there's a biological disease where
depression reaction may be a malfunction okay we can see this in the number of different things so
if you get a lot of mini strokes especially in the positive affect system of your left hemisphere
people are much more vulnerable than to feeling depressed with a dominant right hemisphere system
that's more activated negative well if you had a bunch of mini strokes that knocked out your
positive affect system thyroid fluctuations as well as we can start to think about people who are
chronically depressed and you know in gender a particular stress reaction and they would have
you know that orients them or situates them in a sick role that is really unable to be
reestablished by particular patterns of positive investment and so here you see a wide variety
of different features and this is a radically different and generally reserved for significantly
more severe conditions although not necessarily that is somebody could have in theory a depressive
disease like mild depression stemming from a hypothyroid that then with the enhancement
of the thyroid take some synthroid medication all of a sudden that is alleviated so it's not
necessarily the case that this is severity but we can think certainly in terms of severity
in relationship to being relationship to broken biology this and this gives rise to a classification
that I prefer to distinguish neurotic versus melancholic depression and I'll share a blog with
you on that so a neurotic depression is a low-grade negative mood low life satisfaction often mixed
with anxiety tied to stressors may be some loss of pressure but also can be hidden so this is the
most common presentation that we see in an outpatient setting we deal mostly we treat
neurotic depression you might get an impressive persistent depressed disorder depression with
adjust mood I'm sorry adjustment disorder with depressed mood or a mild maybe moderate major
depressive episode meet criteria here in contrast melancholic depression is really a complete
neurophysiological behavioral shutdown you see psychomotor retardation significant disruption
in biorhythms like much less sleeping much less eating massive anhedonia serious change in
coping sorry the thing there so that's a way then of thinking about the kinds of depressions
that you see if you engage in you know you work in an inpatient hospital and the level of impairment
that somebody is in a severe major depressive episode you know that a psychiatrist would identify
as a severe mdd note there's a mild mdd which is kind of an oxymoron but there's severe major
depressive episode I've certainly seen people you know basically can't get out of bed certainly it'd
be very difficult to do any psychotherapy with generally you want to do just basic behavioral
activation and support very minimal goal setting and anything that they can find any little pleasure
in to give immediate feedback with that's not the case of most individuals in outpatient psychotherapy
so what are the advantages and implications of this provides a simple easy functional
conception of depression readily understandable integrates various theoretical work on a brain
behavior relation allows a broad clear conceptual framework for differentiating depressive reactions
from depressive disease disorders and depressive diseases and shifts the focus on what's the cause
behavioral depression so notice we're not now is it a disease or is it a reaction it's depression is
a state of mental behavioral shutdown now we can see the functional relations between what has happened
who the person is what the context is what the future holds or potentially and then that situates
then the secondary classification of the shutdown as either a reaction a disorder or a disease
so the bottom line is depression describes the state of mental mental behavioral shutdown remember
before I saw different between sort of a theory and a metaphysical conception a metaphysical
conception when it's done right then anchors your concepts in categories with clarity so this
then says hey we've been talking about this all wrong we need to describe the state of behavioral
shutdown and then we can shift the focus in relationship to activity phenomenology physiology
could be added here and recognize that what we see is a shift in negative valence and withdrawal
that we could think about the functional causes of that and the person environment developmental
transaction and that gives us a classification that I believe does justice to the complexity
and enables us to move much in a much clearer and grounded way between psychology psychiatry
and other professions as well as the population in general
