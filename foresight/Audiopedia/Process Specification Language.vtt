00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
The process specification language is a set of logic terms used to describe processes.

00:05.920 --> 00:10.440
The logic terms are specified in an ontology that provides a formal description of the

00:10.440 --> 00:14.280
components and their relationships that make up a process.

00:14.280 --> 00:18.760
The ontology was developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and

00:18.760 --> 00:25.640
has been approved as an international standard in the document ISO 18629.

00:25.640 --> 00:30.800
The process specification language can be used for the representation of manufacturing,

00:30.800 --> 00:36.720
engineering and business processes, including production scheduling, process planning, workflow

00:36.720 --> 00:43.000
management, business process re-engineering, simulation, process realization, process

00:43.000 --> 00:46.040
modeling, and project management.

00:46.040 --> 00:51.720
In the manufacturing domain, PSLA Euro 1 registered trademark S objective is to serve

00:51.720 --> 00:56.680
as a common representation for integrating several process-related applications throughout

00:56.680 --> 00:59.720
the manufacturing process life cycle.

00:59.720 --> 01:06.000
Ontology, the foundation of the ontology is a set of primitive concepts, constants,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.160
functions, and relations.

01:08.160 --> 01:12.960
This core ontology is then used to describe more complex concepts.

01:12.960 --> 01:19.120
The ontology uses the common logic interchange format to represent the concepts, constants,

01:19.120 --> 01:21.280
functions, and relations.

01:21.280 --> 01:26.000
This ontology provides a vocabulary of classes and relations for concepts at the ground level

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
of event instances, object instances, and time points.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.240
PSLA Euro 1 registered trademark S top level is built around the following, activity, a

01:37.240 --> 01:42.280
class or type of action, such as install part, which is the class of actions in which parts

01:42.280 --> 01:47.600
are installed, activity occurrence, an event or action that takes place at a specific place

01:47.600 --> 01:52.640
and time, such as a specific instance of install part occurring at a specific time

01:52.640 --> 01:59.760
stump, time point, a point in time, object, anything that is not a time point or an activity.

01:59.760 --> 02:10.320
