00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
The process specification language is a set of logic terms used to describe processes.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,440
The logic terms are specified in an ontology that provides a formal description of the

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,280
components and their relationships that make up a process.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,760
The ontology was developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,640
has been approved as an international standard in the document ISO 18629.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,800
The process specification language can be used for the representation of manufacturing,

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,720
engineering and business processes, including production scheduling, process planning, workflow

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,000
management, business process re-engineering, simulation, process realization, process

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,040
modeling, and project management.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,720
In the manufacturing domain, PSLA Euro 1 registered trademark S objective is to serve

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,680
as a common representation for integrating several process-related applications throughout

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,720
the manufacturing process life cycle.

13
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:06,000
Ontology, the foundation of the ontology is a set of primitive concepts, constants,

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,160
functions, and relations.

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,960
This core ontology is then used to describe more complex concepts.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,120
The ontology uses the common logic interchange format to represent the concepts, constants,

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,280
functions, and relations.

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,000
This ontology provides a vocabulary of classes and relations for concepts at the ground level

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
of event instances, object instances, and time points.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,240
PSLA Euro 1 registered trademark S top level is built around the following, activity, a

21
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,280
class or type of action, such as install part, which is the class of actions in which parts

22
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,600
are installed, activity occurrence, an event or action that takes place at a specific place

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,640
and time, such as a specific instance of install part occurring at a specific time

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,760
stump, time point, a point in time, object, anything that is not a time point or an activity.
