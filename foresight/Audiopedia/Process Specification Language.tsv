0	5920	The process specification language is a set of logic terms used to describe processes.
5920	10440	The logic terms are specified in an ontology that provides a formal description of the
10440	14280	components and their relationships that make up a process.
14280	18760	The ontology was developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and
18760	25640	has been approved as an international standard in the document ISO 18629.
25640	30800	The process specification language can be used for the representation of manufacturing,
30800	36720	engineering and business processes, including production scheduling, process planning, workflow
36720	43000	management, business process re-engineering, simulation, process realization, process
43000	46040	modeling, and project management.
46040	51720	In the manufacturing domain, PSLA Euro 1 registered trademark S objective is to serve
51720	56680	as a common representation for integrating several process-related applications throughout
56680	59720	the manufacturing process life cycle.
59720	66000	Ontology, the foundation of the ontology is a set of primitive concepts, constants,
66000	68160	functions, and relations.
68160	72960	This core ontology is then used to describe more complex concepts.
72960	79120	The ontology uses the common logic interchange format to represent the concepts, constants,
79120	81280	functions, and relations.
81280	86000	This ontology provides a vocabulary of classes and relations for concepts at the ground level
86000	91000	of event instances, object instances, and time points.
91000	97240	PSLA Euro 1 registered trademark S top level is built around the following, activity, a
97240	102280	class or type of action, such as install part, which is the class of actions in which parts
102280	107600	are installed, activity occurrence, an event or action that takes place at a specific place
107600	112640	and time, such as a specific instance of install part occurring at a specific time
112640	119760	stump, time point, a point in time, object, anything that is not a time point or an activity.
