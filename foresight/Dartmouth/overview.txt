 The discussion revolves around two different approaches to optimizing decision-making processes in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly when dealing with partial observability and belief states. The speaker argues that the traditional Bellman's optimality equations, which are foundational in many decision-making frameworks like Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), are not suitable for continuously distributed beliefs due to their inherent limitations and difficulties in scaling.

Instead, the speaker promotes Hamilton's principle of least action as a more appropriate framework for optimizing AI systems. This approach uses functional minimization to directly optimize expectations or beliefs before any actions are taken, which avoids the complexities of partial observed MDPs. The speaker points out that this method has been validated by solving problems that are intractable with traditional methods.

The speaker acknowledges that some AI researchers and institutions like Google DeepMind have started incorporating related ideas, such as variational free energy in deep learning models. However, the speaker suggests that these methods could be improved by moving away from "amortisation" (i.e., learning parameters of neural networks) and directly optimizing beliefs or expectations.

The speaker also hints at the importance of incorporating surprise-seeking and curiosity into AI systems to enable more creative and adaptive problem-solving, which goes beyond the scope of mere surprise aversion. The challenge lies in making these ideas tractable and scalable for real-world applications, which is an area that will likely see significant development over the next five to ten years.

In summary, the speaker advocates for a paradigm shift from traditional Bellman's optimality equations to Hamilton's principle of least action for optimizing AI systems, and suggests that this approach can lead to more effective and scalable solutions in the field of AI.
