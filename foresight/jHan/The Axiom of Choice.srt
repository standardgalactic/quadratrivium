1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,080
In mathematics, you want to prove things.

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,200
Usually take some known theorems and ideas and, by using logic and mathematical techniques,

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,880
show something new.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,840
But what lies at the foundation of mathematics?

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,120
You prove new statements from statements that you already know,

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:35,280
which themselves were proven from other statements and so on until you reach, well, assumptions.

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,440
Stuff we don't really prove, but assume to be true.

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,600
In mathematics, we call these axioms, and they lay the foundations of what we can do.

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,040
The most widely used system of axioms is called Zermelo-Francole set theory with the axiom of

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,360
choice, and these axioms talk specifically about sets.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,200
And the reason this is is because sets are so foundational that it's in everything in mathematics,

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,560
from numbers to functions to algebraic structures, which can all be described by sets.

13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,400
But there's a specific axiom that stands out above the rest, the axiom of choice.

14
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,520
We'll see what it really says about how we make choices in mathematics,

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,960
as well as the controversy that this axiom brought, and why, even after all that,

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,760
mathematicians hold fast to this axiom.

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,800
But first, we need to learn a bit of set theory, because usually when you ask someone what a set

18
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,160
is, they just say a collection of mathematical things.

19
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,520
You know, we can have the set of natural numbers or real numbers.

20
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,440
A basis of the vector space R2 is just a set of vectors.

21
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,960
In fact, basically everything in mathematics, from ordered pairs to functions, relations,

22
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,960
equivalence classes, even numbers themselves, can be described as sets.

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,200
So this is why set theory is foundational in all of mathematics, because sets are the building blocks.

24
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,160
So we need a formal set of rules to govern how sets work, or else you might run into contradictions.

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,640
For example, consider the set of all sets that does not contain itself, call it R,

26
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,760
then is R contained in R? Well, if R is an R, then it contains itself, so it cannot be an R.

27
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,880
But if R is not an R, then R should now be an R. This is called Russell's Paradox,

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,840
which is formulated by Bertrand Russell in 1901 to show that, clearly,

29
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,680
we have to restrict on how we build and talk about sets in some way.

30
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,120
Before this, mathematicians worked with sets and collections in a naive sort of way,

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,080
just using assumptions they thought were self-evident. But with Russell's Paradox,

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,200
mathematicians realized the necessity to lay down the foundational rules of what a set is,

33
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,560
and its properties. In 1908, Ernst Zermelo formulated a list of axioms to base the theory of sets.

34
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,440
Eventually, other mathematicians like Abraham Frankel and John von Neumann added some other

35
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,440
axioms and eventually formulated Zermelo-Frankel set theory, also known as ZF, along with the

36
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,320
axiom of choice, together called ZFC. We won't go through all of ZF today because that probably

37
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,840
requires a whole series of videos, but this is a quick, informal description of what they say.

38
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,040
Two sets are equal if they have the same elements. There exists the empty set. There exists a set

39
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,360
containing two already existing sets. The union of sets is a set. The collection of all subsets of

40
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,480
a set is a set. A definable sub-collection of a set is a set. There exists an infinite set.

41
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,080
The image of any set under a definable function is a set, and every non-empty set contains a member

42
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,160
that it is disjoint with. Now, some of these you can omit in certain circumstances by following from

43
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:05,120
other axioms, but this is the general idea of ZF. Now, it's important to note that ZF or axiom of

44
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,400
choice isn't some god-given, infallible, objective mathematical set of rules. You can construct and

45
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,680
define other axiomatic systems and assumptions, which themselves can be useful in building upon

46
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,720
mathematics. But ZF and the axiom of choice is what we use historically, and so far, works pretty well.

47
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,160
So what does ZF say about sets, and what can we build from them? Well, first, from now on,

48
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,120
everything in mathematics is a set, so it's important that we construct the mathematical

49
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,800
concepts that we're familiar with in terms of sets, and we do this by constructing sets with

50
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:49,360
the same properties that we expect from what we're familiar with. For example, consider the ordered pair

51
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,920
AB, where it's just a collection of two objects with a strict ordering, so AB and BA are not the

52
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:02,320
same if A and B are not the same. What's the defining property of the ordered pair? Well,

53
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,440
how can we say that two ordered pairs are equal? Well, their first elements must be the same,

54
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:14,640
and then their second element must also be the same. So, AB is equal to A'B' if and only if

55
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:20,160
A is equal to A' and B is equal to B'. Can we describe sets with such properties?

56
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,160
Yes, we can in fact formulate multiple constructions, but the widely accepted definition

57
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,840
is a Kurotowski's definition, where AB is this set. It looks a bit wonky, but if you do the math,

58
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,040
you'll get that this set exactly satisfies the defining property of the ordered pair.

59
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,200
Now, defining ordered pairs is important because they help us construct other concepts.

60
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,560
For example, take the Cartesian product of two sets. It's the set of all possible ordered pairs,

61
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,600
AB, such that A is in A and B is in B. For example, the Cartesian product of the natural numbers and

62
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,360
the natural numbers is all possible pairs of natural numbers. Then we can define something

63
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,760
called a relation from sets X to Y. Formally, these are just a subset of the Cartesian product

64
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:16,080
X times Y. Then we say that some X and X is related to some Y and Y denoted like this,

65
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,360
if X, Y is in this subset R of X times Y. For example, the greater than relation of the natural

66
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:32,480
numbers is a subset G of N times N. Then 2 comma 1 is an element of G, but 3 comma 7 is not an element

67
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:39,600
of G. But what if we restrict a relation such that every X and X can be related to exactly

68
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:47,600
1 Y and Y? Well, this is called a rule of assignment. But let's step back a bit. A rule of assignment

69
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,240
is a set of ordered pairs in X times Y, where each X and X is related, or you can say mapped,

70
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,640
to a unique Y and Y. That, my friends, is just a function. Recall back in grade school how you

71
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,160
described a function as a graph on the Cartesian plane. The graph had to pass the vertical line

72
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,920
test showing that each X element had to be mapped to exactly one Y element. Well, this graph is just

73
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,200
a representation of a set of ordered pairs. Take the real valued function f of X equals

74
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:25,200
X squared on the reels. We can demonstrate it as a graph where each point on the graph is an ordered

75
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,880
pair. So this graph represents the set of ordered pairs, which is just the rule of assignment defined

76
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:38,480
by the rule f of X equals X squared. So a function is just a set defined by this rule of assignment.

77
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,760
Functions are at the heart of the axiom of choice, so let's briefly go over a few properties and

78
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,440
definitions. A function is defined between two sets, the domain, which is the set of inputs,

79
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,480
and the co-domain, which contains the set of outputs. In our formal definition, if we have a

80
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,360
rule of assignment as set of ordered pairs, the domain is a set which the first element of the

81
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,640
order pair comes from, and the co-domain is a set in which the second element of each order pair comes

82
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,520
from. Technically speaking, a function is then formally defined as a triple consisting of the

83
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,920
rule of assignment, the domain, and the co-domain, but for simplicity, we can just talk about the

84
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,680
rule of assignment. Indeed, the rule of assignment of a function maps each element of the domain to

85
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,080
a unique element of the co-domain. Notice that the co-domain isn't necessarily the set of all outputs,

86
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,560
that would be the image of the function. Like for f of x equals x squared,

87
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,360
not all real numbers are outputs of this function, in particular the negative numbers.

88
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,960
If a function does map to all of the co-domain, such that the range is the co-domain, the function

89
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:47,040
is called surjective, or onto. Now, looking at the domain, while each element can only be mapped

90
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,800
to one element in the co-domain, it doesn't mean two elements of the domain might end up mapping

91
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,560
to the same element in the co-domain. In our f of x equals x squared example, negative two and

92
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,200
positive two map to the same element, four. But if it happens that distinct elements in the domain

93
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,480
are mapped to distinct elements in the co-domain, then that function is called injective, or one

94
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,040
to one. If a function is both surjective and injective, such a function is called bijective.

95
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,000
There's a lot more we can dig into, but I think we're ready for a formal approach

96
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,840
to the axiom of choice. Take a set x, which is a collection of sets which are non-empty,

97
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:34,000
meaning each element of x is a set that contains something. The axiom of choice says that there

98
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,760
is a function which, for every set in x, chooses an element inside that set. Such a function is

99
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,640
called a choice function of x. When you hear like that, it seems a bit underwhelming, but let's

100
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,800
look at the machinery of what's going on here. So our domain is a set of these non-empty sets,

101
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,800
then our co-domain is a set of all the elements in each of these sets, since our output will always

102
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:08,160
be in one of these sets. So the co-domain is a union of all these non-empty sets. Just imagine

103
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,480
that these non-empty sets in x are boxes containing some mathematical things, then our co-domain is

104
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,880
just a big box where you dump all the contents of these boxes into. Then the co-domain is a set of

105
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,520
all the possible elements we can choose from, and our choice function chooses one for each element of

106
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:34,240
x. We call this the union set of x, which we can also denote with the big union symbol like this.

107
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,920
Then we say that there is a function from x to the union set of x, such that f of x is in x for

108
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:51,840
each x and big x. So f of x basically chooses an element in the non-empty set x. Now the axiom of

109
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,960
choice doesn't actually give us a way to find this function or what this function looks like.

110
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:04,640
It just declares that for any set of non-empty sets x, such a function must exist. So why is this

111
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:11,520
axiom so important or even necessary? It feels, well, a bit obvious. Well, that's because most

112
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,040
of us live in a finite mindset. If we have a finite number of sets, we can easily prove that such a

113
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,200
choice function must exist using a technique called induction. You don't need an axiom to make finite

114
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:30,240
choices. In fact, even some infinite choices don't really need the axiom of choice. Take the set of

115
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,560
all possible subsets of the natural numbers called the power set of the naturals. Then a choice function

116
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,720
f for the power set of n chooses a natural number from each possible subset of the naturals.

117
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,960
So the domain is the power set of n and the co-domain is a set of naturals. But we really

118
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,960
don't need the axiom of choice to show that a choice function exists. For example, you can easily

119
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,720
define a choice function by just choosing the smallest element in each subset. By the properties

120
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:07,600
of the naturals, every subset contains the smallest element. So again, we don't need a c to show that

121
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:15,040
a choice function exists. But the universe of sets is much, much bigger than the naturals. For

122
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,800
example, the real numbers live in a bigger size of infinity than the naturals called uncountable

123
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,840
infinity. But we can also define bigger infinities by using something called ordinals. In essence,

124
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:33,600
we can define bigger and bigger infinities by describing what are called different order types

125
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,920
of the same size. It's definitely out of the scope of this video, but the point is sets can get

126
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,800
stupidly unfathomably large. And so if we want to make these uncountably infinite number of choices,

127
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,040
well, we can't just do that using any of our zf axioms. We need the axiom of choice to assume

128
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,120
that we can make these infinitely many choices, no matter how incomprehensibly large our sets

129
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,760
can get. And it turns out that making these choices is necessary even for the most seemingly obvious

130
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:12,960
theorems about sets. For example, let a function f from x to y be surjective. Remember, it means

131
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:19,120
all of its co domain is mapped by some element of the domain. Then does this imply that there exists

132
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:26,240
an injective function g from y to x, that is, a function where two distinct elements of y are

133
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,480
always mapped to distinct elements in x? Well, let's think about this. By the surjectivity of f,

134
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,960
each element in y is mapped by some x in x. So simple. Let's just let g of y be this x.

135
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:47,120
But wait, there is no guarantee that f is injective. So there could be multiple x's in x

136
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:54,880
that map to this y. So if x1 and x2 both map to y by f, which one do we choose for our g?

137
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,240
Clearly, we need the axiom of choice to choose, arbitrarily, some element to map y to.

138
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,560
This is how we'd formally state this. Let x sub y be the set of all elements in x such that f

139
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,200
of x is equal to y. So this is the set of x's from which we'd like to choose what to map y to.

140
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,080
Think of like we're watching The Bachelors and this is the set of all candidates for g of y.

141
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:27,760
Notice that x sub y is a subset of x. Since our choice function, let's call h,

142
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,920
wants to choose an element of this subset, its inputs are the subsets of x. So the domain of

143
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,400
our choice function h can be the set of all subsets of x. That's the power set of x. Remember,

144
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,680
this is the set of all subsets of x. So x sub y is an element of the power set of x.

145
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,680
But recall that ac requires our domain to contain only non-empty sets. So we do have

146
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,480
to remove the empty set, which is technically a subset of x. Okay, then its co-domain is the

147
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,040
union set of p of x. But clearly, this is just x. I mean, everything in here is just a subset of x,

148
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,560
so you dump all of its elements into one big collection, it's just gonna be x.

149
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,960
So the axiom of choice affirms that there exists a choice function h from p of x minus 0 to x.

150
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,720
In particular, h of x sub y will be in x sub y, meaning h of x of y is guaranteed

151
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,000
to be one of our bachelors. So that's how we'll define g. For every y and y,

152
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,520
let g of y just be h of x sub y. Let's show that g is injective. If y is not equal to y prime,

153
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,920
then xy and xy prime must be disjoint, meaning they have no elements in common.

154
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,920
Indeed, if x was in both xy and xy prime, it would mean that f of x equals y and f of x equals y

155
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,000
prime, which contradicts the rules for functions, that each element is mapped to a unique output.

156
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,080
So if xy is disjoint from xy prime, any element in xy is distinct from any element in xy prime.

157
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:12,960
So g of y equals hxy is not equal to gy prime equals hxy prime. So g is injective.

158
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,760
So that's how you apply the axiom of choice in a proof. And the axiom of choice appears a lot

159
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:26,240
in mathematics. In fact, it is equivalent over zf to a lot of statements. And when I say that two

160
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,080
statements are equivalent over zf, it means that, assuming all the other axioms of zf,

161
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,440
the statements imply one another. Basically, it means that the statements are the same.

162
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:45,120
They are simply different ways of stating the same innate fact. So saying ac is equivalent to

163
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,280
some statement means if you want this statement to be true, you will need the axiom of choice.

164
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,160
So let's go over some equivalences of ac in set theory. One of the most important equivalences of

165
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,440
ac is Zorn's lemma. But before we state Zorn's lemma, we need some preliminaries.

166
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,360
Let's say you wanted a way to compare elements of a set x. Then you can define what's called

167
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,480
an ordering on that set. It has to satisfy some properties. First, it must be reflexive,

168
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,600
meaning every element of x is related to itself. It must also be anti-symmetric,

169
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:26,240
meaning if x is related to y and y is related to x, this means x is equal to y. Finally,

170
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,840
it must be transitive, meaning if x is related to y and y is related to z, then x is related to z.

171
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,760
A prime example of an ordering is the greater than or equal to relation on the set of numbers

172
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,960
like the integers and the reals. In fact, in general, we like to use this notation for

173
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,280
orderings on sets, but of course there are many more orderings than just the greater than or equal.

174
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,840
For example, take the set inclusion relation, given by a is a subset of p, and the power set

175
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:01,200
of some set. This also satisfies three properties, but here's the thing. You can choose any two numbers,

176
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,160
and you'll always be able to compare them with greater than or equal to. But if you choose two

177
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:13,040
elements of a set containing sets, they might not be subsets of one another, like 1, 2, 3,

178
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:20,080
and 2, 3, 4 can't be compared by set inclusion. No worries, such a set with a relation that

179
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,680
satisfies the three properties, but not all elements of the set can be compared to every other element

180
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:32,000
is called a partial ordering. And if, like the integers with a greater than or equal to relation,

181
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,600
every element can be compared to every other element, that set is called a total ordering.

182
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,760
Now let's say that you have a partial ordering on some set, and you want a subset

183
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,800
of that set that is a total ordering induced by that same ordering on the whole set.

184
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,720
Then such a subset is called a chain, and the chain is a good name for them because

185
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,600
elements of such subsets form a chain of ordered elements. Now in general, if you have a subset

186
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,240
s of a partially ordered set x, you can define what's called an upper bound of s. This is some

187
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,520
element u of x, such that u is greater than or equal to every element in s. Now u doesn't have

188
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,840
to be in s, but it could, and there could be multiple upper bounds. For example, an upper bound

189
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:29,760
of the subset 1, 2, 6 in the set of naturals is 7, but also 1000, or maybe 6, or basically all

190
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,320
natural numbers greater than or equal to 6. But not all subsets have upper bounds, like take the set

191
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,560
of even numbers, which obviously doesn't have an upper bound. No natural number is greater than or

192
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,280
equal to every even number. Finally, let's define something called a maximal element of x.

193
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,160
An element m of a partially ordered set x is maximal if there is no other element of x that

194
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,320
is greater than or equal to m. For example, in the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with the usual greater

195
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:08,480
than or equal to ordering, 5 is a maximal element. But in the set of all natural numbers,

196
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:16,640
well, there is no maximal element. Now we can define Zorn's lemma. Let x be a partially ordered

197
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:25,280
set induced by some relation. Suppose that for every chain c of x, c has an upper bound, then x

198
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:31,840
has a maximal element. A few questions arise pretty quickly. First, where is the axiom of

199
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,520
choice in this? This was supposed to be an equivalent statement, yet it looks and feels so

200
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:44,000
different. And also, what really is this statement saying? What is it used for? Let's answer the

201
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,280
second question first. A lot of mathematical concepts that you may know are actually maximal

202
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,800
elements in disguise. If you know some linear algebra, think about the basis of a vector space.

203
00:20:54,800 --> 00:21:00,640
You can pretty easily prove with basic linear algebra that a basis of some vector space v

204
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,880
is the maximal element of the set of all linearly independent subsets of v. So,

205
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,480
Zorn's lemma can be crucial in proving the existence of some very important mathematical

206
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:19,840
objects. So, how do Zorn's lemma and the axiom of choice relate? Well first, let's try to find

207
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,600
ac in Zorn's lemma. In other words, if Zorn's lemma is true, does that mean that we can find

208
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:33,600
a choice function for any set? The answer is yes. Take a set x of non-ante sets, and let a be the

209
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,960
set of functions f, or technically rule of assignments, don't worry too much about the semantics,

210
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,520
such that its domain is a subset of x, and it satisfies f of x is an x for all x in the domain

211
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:52,000
of f. Well, this set a is a partially ordered set induced by the set inclusion relation.

212
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,200
But it turns out that every chain in A has an upper bound. So you can apply Zorn's and show

213
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:06,320
that A has a maximal element. Then you can show that this maximal element is exactly a choice

214
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:15,360
function, or x. Zorn's lemma implies the axiom of choice. How about the other implication? Does ac

215
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:22,880
imply Zorn's? Yeah. But that proof is a lot more complicated. It requires ordinals and a technique

216
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,640
called transfinite recursion, which uses the axiom of replacement. The tools required for this proof

217
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,080
are beyond the scope of this video, but as a general idea, you take a partially ordered set A

218
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,280
where every chain has an upper bound. Then you construct some subset of A by using the axiom

219
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:45,360
of choice to recursively choose what are called strict upper bounds. These are basically elements

220
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,360
that are strictly bigger than everything in a subset. Basically, at each step, if your subset

221
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,920
still has some strict upper bounds, you choose one and add it to the subset. We do this continuously

222
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:04,400
until the subset we constructed has no more upper bounds. This way, we want to construct a maximal

223
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:11,440
element of A by taking this subset and taking its union set. But because we could have so many choices

224
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:18,560
for such strict upper bounds, we have to use the axiom of choice. This kind of recursion is also

225
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:24,480
not over the naturals, but instead each step is marked by these transfinite objects called the

226
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,400
ordinals. You can then use an axiom called replacement to prove that this transfinite recursion

227
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:38,880
must eventually stop. And thus, you have constructed a maximal element using ac. So ac implies zorns.

228
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,280
So that's the first important equivalence of ac. But there's another also very important

229
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:51,600
equivalence of ac called the well ordering theorem. Remember the ordering stuff from zorns lemma?

230
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,880
Well, let's suppose that a set x has a total ordering, meaning every element can be compared

231
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,360
to every other element. Such an ordering is called well founded if every subset of x has

232
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,800
what's called a least element, meaning everything in s is greater than or equal to this least element.

233
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,520
If a set has a total ordering and is also well founded, we say that the set can be well ordered.

234
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,920
For example, the set of naturals with the usual ordering is clearly well ordered. We know that

235
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,880
the naturals and their usual ordering is a total ordering. And it's not hard to see that every

236
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,360
subset of the naturals must have a least element, because if not, you'd be able to find some infinitely

237
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,160
descending subset of the naturals, which cannot happen because, well, you'd have to eventually

238
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:45,520
stop after some finite steps at zero. But what about the integers? Well, it sure has a total

239
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,960
ordering under our usual ordering relation, but it's not well founded. Take the subset of all

240
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:56,800
negative integers. It doesn't have a least element. But this doesn't mean the integers

241
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:02,400
can't be well ordered. How about we define a new relation on the integer, where a is less than b,

242
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,600
if the absolute value of a is less than the absolute value of b. Now, if the absolute values

243
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,000
are equal, and let's say a is not equal to b, then this must mean that b is negative a. So,

244
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,000
whichever of a or b is positive, let's order first. So such an ordering would look like this,

245
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,480
zero, one, minus one, two, minus two, three, minus three, and so on. Then this ordering

246
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,800
is well founded. You can see how our order relation may look a bit weird, but nonetheless,

247
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:40,960
the set can be well ordered. But can we do this for every set? You can, in fact, define a pretty

248
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,480
nice well ordering on the rationals and in general, any set that is countable, meaning it has size

249
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:53,520
equal or smaller than the naturals. But when things get uncountably infinite, like the reels,

250
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:01,520
it becomes difficult to find a well ordering. But even so, do we know one can exist? Well,

251
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,200
the well ordering theorem says that every set can be well ordered. And it turns out,

252
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,560
the well ordering theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice.

253
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,320
Like Zorn's lemma showing that the well ordering theorem implies ac is a bit more easier. If we

254
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,480
assume the well ordering theorem, take any set of non-empty sets x and look at the union set of x,

255
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:29,280
then the union set of x has a well ordering. In particular, every subset of u of x has a least

256
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:36,960
element by well foundedness. But notice that every element x of x is a subset of the union set of x.

257
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:45,280
So we can define a choice function from x to union set of x, such that f of x is the least

258
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:52,640
element of x as a subset in ux with respect to its well ordering. Well, the least element of x

259
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:59,120
as a subset of the union set of x is obviously in x, so we just defined a choice function for x.

260
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,320
On the other hand, showing that ac implies the well ordering theorem is again a bit more

261
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,280
complicated. And again, we need stuff like transfinite recursion and ordinals to define

262
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,880
a well ordering. But the idea is pretty straightforward. For any set x, you basically

263
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,560
use the axiom of choice to choose an element in x. Set that as your least element, then choose

264
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,120
another element from the remaining elements in x, that's your next element in our order,

265
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,320
then you just continue to do that recursively, again with the weird transfinite recursion done

266
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:36,560
over the ordinals, and again, by the axiom of replacement, it necessitates that we must stop.

267
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,720
Then we have basically constructed a well ordering on x. Again, the details are out of

268
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,640
the scope of this video, but hopefully you can see the choiceness required for the well ordering

269
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,760
theorem. But the equivalences of ac are not just limited to set theory. There are a lot of equivalences

270
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:02,800
to very many important statements outside of set theory. First, every vector space has a basis.

271
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,920
If you took any level of linear algebra, this is a foundational statement about vector spaces.

272
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:13,840
When we are given a vector space, we automatically assume it has a basis. It turns out that this

273
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:22,000
theorem is equivalent to ac. Second, that every ring contains a maximal ideal. This is a statement

274
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,040
in ring theory, and it's a pretty important statement because maximal ideals are quite useful

275
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:32,560
tools. And like our previous example, it's a foundational theorem in algebra, which is also

276
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:38,000
equivalent to the axiom of choice. Now, these statements might seem a bit disconnected from

277
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,440
our first formulation of the axiom of choice about choice functions, but they are quite immediate

278
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,840
from our other equivalent formulation, Zorn's lemma. Both a basis of a vector space and a maximal

279
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,680
ideal of a ring are just maximal elements under the set inclusion relation. So oftentimes,

280
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:01,600
in abstract algebra, the preferred form of the axiom of choice is Zorn's lemma. Of course,

281
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,440
the fact that these statements also imply Zorn's lemma is quite interesting. Another important

282
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,880
equivalence of ac is Tykinov's theorem, which states that the product of any collection of

283
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,200
compact topological spaces is compact with respect to product topology. It's considered one of the

284
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,840
most crucial theorems of a branch of topology called point set topology. And these are but just

285
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:32,880
a few of many examples. So clearly, the axiom of choice is an indispensable theorem of mathematics.

286
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,160
If we have the axiom of choice, we can prove these important theorems, and if we want any of

287
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:44,160
these foundational theorems to be true, the axiom of choice must follow. So what's the problem?

288
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,160
Why did I say that the axiom of choice is controversial?

289
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:56,080
Well, there are a lot of reasons for this controversy. One comes from the philosophical

290
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,560
consequence of accepting the arbitrary existence of these choice functions, maximal elements,

291
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:09,040
well-orderings, without any concrete way to construct or describe these things. We just

292
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,840
say that they must exist, but as far as we know, we have no idea what they look like.

293
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,120
Another problem occurs with certain implications of ac that seem, well, counterintuitive.

294
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,240
Take the Banach-Tarski paradox, which says that you can take a solid 3D unit ball,

295
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,800
take it apart into finally many pieces, and using only rotations and translations,

296
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:37,120
assemble the pieces to get two exact copies of the unit ball. I mean, this sounds ridiculous,

297
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,840
surely that contradicts all intuition of geometry and volume, but if ac is true,

298
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,720
it's always Banach-Tarski. So if we want these really nice theorems and mathematics,

299
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,960
like Takanov's theorem, we're going to have to accept stuff like Banach-Tarski.

300
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,840
So yes, the axiom of choice breaks our intuition in more ways than one,

301
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,280
and this weirdness has garnered some controversy throughout its history. But over time,

302
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:09,360
the majority of mathematicians have agreed to accept ac as a valid axiom to derive the theorems,

303
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,840
and as weird as ac might be, it hasn't shown any contradiction so far. But Banach-Tarski,

304
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,920
for example, is just a consequence of describing sets so weird that the concept of volume really

305
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:27,120
just falls apart. It may break our intuition, but that's different from a contradiction.

306
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:33,120
But if anything, the axiom of choice shows the chaotic nature of mathematics.

307
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,920
Our theorems are not something to be taken for granted. Our truths are often confusing and

308
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,920
built upon a foundation not of objectives, but of assumptions we can only hope are strong.

309
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,240
But maybe that's the beauty of it. There may be some things we can never truly know the answer to,

310
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,800
maybe even some statements that don't have an answer. But we constructed our system of truths

311
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:03,760
and relying only on our intuition and assumptions and logic discovered what the universe had to offer.

312
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,960
Even if we know there is a limitation, that doesn't mean we can't reach new heights.

313
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,240
Is the axiom of choice true? Does that question even make sense?

314
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,920
Are the axioms of ZFC truly free of contradictions? We may never know,

315
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,920
but maybe that's not the point. Just being curious, desiring to know more, and pushing

316
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,680
ourselves to make sure our truths are truths, that in and of itself allows us to contemplate

317
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:47,040
and debate and imagine and discover. Until next time.
