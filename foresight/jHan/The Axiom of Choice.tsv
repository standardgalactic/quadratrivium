0	16080	In mathematics, you want to prove things.
16080	21200	Usually take some known theorems and ideas and, by using logic and mathematical techniques,
21200	22880	show something new.
22880	25840	But what lies at the foundation of mathematics?
26080	29120	You prove new statements from statements that you already know,
29120	35280	which themselves were proven from other statements and so on until you reach, well, assumptions.
35920	39440	Stuff we don't really prove, but assume to be true.
40240	45600	In mathematics, we call these axioms, and they lay the foundations of what we can do.
46640	53040	The most widely used system of axioms is called Zermelo-Francole set theory with the axiom of
53040	57360	choice, and these axioms talk specifically about sets.
57360	63200	And the reason this is is because sets are so foundational that it's in everything in mathematics,
63200	68560	from numbers to functions to algebraic structures, which can all be described by sets.
69440	74400	But there's a specific axiom that stands out above the rest, the axiom of choice.
75200	79520	We'll see what it really says about how we make choices in mathematics,
79520	84960	as well as the controversy that this axiom brought, and why, even after all that,
84960	87760	mathematicians hold fast to this axiom.
88640	94800	But first, we need to learn a bit of set theory, because usually when you ask someone what a set
94800	98160	is, they just say a collection of mathematical things.
98160	101520	You know, we can have the set of natural numbers or real numbers.
101520	105440	A basis of the vector space R2 is just a set of vectors.
106080	110960	In fact, basically everything in mathematics, from ordered pairs to functions, relations,
110960	114960	equivalence classes, even numbers themselves, can be described as sets.
115600	121200	So this is why set theory is foundational in all of mathematics, because sets are the building blocks.
121920	128160	So we need a formal set of rules to govern how sets work, or else you might run into contradictions.
128800	134640	For example, consider the set of all sets that does not contain itself, call it R,
134640	141760	then is R contained in R? Well, if R is an R, then it contains itself, so it cannot be an R.
142400	148880	But if R is not an R, then R should now be an R. This is called Russell's Paradox,
148880	153840	which is formulated by Bertrand Russell in 1901 to show that, clearly,
153840	157680	we have to restrict on how we build and talk about sets in some way.
158320	163120	Before this, mathematicians worked with sets and collections in a naive sort of way,
163120	168080	just using assumptions they thought were self-evident. But with Russell's Paradox,
168080	173200	mathematicians realized the necessity to lay down the foundational rules of what a set is,
173200	180560	and its properties. In 1908, Ernst Zermelo formulated a list of axioms to base the theory of sets.
180560	185440	Eventually, other mathematicians like Abraham Frankel and John von Neumann added some other
185440	191440	axioms and eventually formulated Zermelo-Frankel set theory, also known as ZF, along with the
191440	198320	axiom of choice, together called ZFC. We won't go through all of ZF today because that probably
198320	203840	requires a whole series of videos, but this is a quick, informal description of what they say.
204400	211040	Two sets are equal if they have the same elements. There exists the empty set. There exists a set
211040	217360	containing two already existing sets. The union of sets is a set. The collection of all subsets of
217360	224480	a set is a set. A definable sub-collection of a set is a set. There exists an infinite set.
225040	232080	The image of any set under a definable function is a set, and every non-empty set contains a member
232080	238160	that it is disjoint with. Now, some of these you can omit in certain circumstances by following from
238160	245120	other axioms, but this is the general idea of ZF. Now, it's important to note that ZF or axiom of
245120	252400	choice isn't some god-given, infallible, objective mathematical set of rules. You can construct and
252400	257680	define other axiomatic systems and assumptions, which themselves can be useful in building upon
257680	264720	mathematics. But ZF and the axiom of choice is what we use historically, and so far, works pretty well.
265520	272160	So what does ZF say about sets, and what can we build from them? Well, first, from now on,
272160	277120	everything in mathematics is a set, so it's important that we construct the mathematical
277120	282800	concepts that we're familiar with in terms of sets, and we do this by constructing sets with
282800	289360	the same properties that we expect from what we're familiar with. For example, consider the ordered pair
289360	295920	AB, where it's just a collection of two objects with a strict ordering, so AB and BA are not the
295920	302320	same if A and B are not the same. What's the defining property of the ordered pair? Well,
302320	307440	how can we say that two ordered pairs are equal? Well, their first elements must be the same,
307440	314640	and then their second element must also be the same. So, AB is equal to A'B' if and only if
314640	320160	A is equal to A' and B is equal to B'. Can we describe sets with such properties?
320880	326160	Yes, we can in fact formulate multiple constructions, but the widely accepted definition
326160	333840	is a Kurotowski's definition, where AB is this set. It looks a bit wonky, but if you do the math,
333840	339040	you'll get that this set exactly satisfies the defining property of the ordered pair.
340080	345200	Now, defining ordered pairs is important because they help us construct other concepts.
345200	350560	For example, take the Cartesian product of two sets. It's the set of all possible ordered pairs,
350560	357600	AB, such that A is in A and B is in B. For example, the Cartesian product of the natural numbers and
357600	363360	the natural numbers is all possible pairs of natural numbers. Then we can define something
363360	369760	called a relation from sets X to Y. Formally, these are just a subset of the Cartesian product
369760	376080	X times Y. Then we say that some X and X is related to some Y and Y denoted like this,
376080	383360	if X, Y is in this subset R of X times Y. For example, the greater than relation of the natural
383360	392480	numbers is a subset G of N times N. Then 2 comma 1 is an element of G, but 3 comma 7 is not an element
392480	399600	of G. But what if we restrict a relation such that every X and X can be related to exactly
399760	407600	1 Y and Y? Well, this is called a rule of assignment. But let's step back a bit. A rule of assignment
407600	414240	is a set of ordered pairs in X times Y, where each X and X is related, or you can say mapped,
414240	420640	to a unique Y and Y. That, my friends, is just a function. Recall back in grade school how you
420640	426160	described a function as a graph on the Cartesian plane. The graph had to pass the vertical line
426160	433920	test showing that each X element had to be mapped to exactly one Y element. Well, this graph is just
433920	439200	a representation of a set of ordered pairs. Take the real valued function f of X equals
439200	445200	X squared on the reels. We can demonstrate it as a graph where each point on the graph is an ordered
445200	450880	pair. So this graph represents the set of ordered pairs, which is just the rule of assignment defined
450880	458480	by the rule f of X equals X squared. So a function is just a set defined by this rule of assignment.
459360	463760	Functions are at the heart of the axiom of choice, so let's briefly go over a few properties and
463760	469440	definitions. A function is defined between two sets, the domain, which is the set of inputs,
469440	474480	and the co-domain, which contains the set of outputs. In our formal definition, if we have a
474480	479360	rule of assignment as set of ordered pairs, the domain is a set which the first element of the
479360	484640	order pair comes from, and the co-domain is a set in which the second element of each order pair comes
484640	489520	from. Technically speaking, a function is then formally defined as a triple consisting of the
489520	493920	rule of assignment, the domain, and the co-domain, but for simplicity, we can just talk about the
493920	499680	rule of assignment. Indeed, the rule of assignment of a function maps each element of the domain to
499680	506080	a unique element of the co-domain. Notice that the co-domain isn't necessarily the set of all outputs,
506080	510560	that would be the image of the function. Like for f of x equals x squared,
510560	515360	not all real numbers are outputs of this function, in particular the negative numbers.
515360	520960	If a function does map to all of the co-domain, such that the range is the co-domain, the function
520960	527040	is called surjective, or onto. Now, looking at the domain, while each element can only be mapped
527040	532800	to one element in the co-domain, it doesn't mean two elements of the domain might end up mapping
532800	538560	to the same element in the co-domain. In our f of x equals x squared example, negative two and
538560	545200	positive two map to the same element, four. But if it happens that distinct elements in the domain
545200	550480	are mapped to distinct elements in the co-domain, then that function is called injective, or one
550480	557040	to one. If a function is both surjective and injective, such a function is called bijective.
557680	562000	There's a lot more we can dig into, but I think we're ready for a formal approach
562000	567840	to the axiom of choice. Take a set x, which is a collection of sets which are non-empty,
567840	574000	meaning each element of x is a set that contains something. The axiom of choice says that there
574000	581760	is a function which, for every set in x, chooses an element inside that set. Such a function is
581760	588640	called a choice function of x. When you hear like that, it seems a bit underwhelming, but let's
588640	594800	look at the machinery of what's going on here. So our domain is a set of these non-empty sets,
594800	600800	then our co-domain is a set of all the elements in each of these sets, since our output will always
600800	608160	be in one of these sets. So the co-domain is a union of all these non-empty sets. Just imagine
608160	614480	that these non-empty sets in x are boxes containing some mathematical things, then our co-domain is
614480	620880	just a big box where you dump all the contents of these boxes into. Then the co-domain is a set of
620880	627520	all the possible elements we can choose from, and our choice function chooses one for each element of
627520	634240	x. We call this the union set of x, which we can also denote with the big union symbol like this.
635200	641920	Then we say that there is a function from x to the union set of x, such that f of x is in x for
641920	651840	each x and big x. So f of x basically chooses an element in the non-empty set x. Now the axiom of
651840	656960	choice doesn't actually give us a way to find this function or what this function looks like.
656960	664640	It just declares that for any set of non-empty sets x, such a function must exist. So why is this
664640	671520	axiom so important or even necessary? It feels, well, a bit obvious. Well, that's because most
671520	677040	of us live in a finite mindset. If we have a finite number of sets, we can easily prove that such a
677040	683200	choice function must exist using a technique called induction. You don't need an axiom to make finite
683200	690240	choices. In fact, even some infinite choices don't really need the axiom of choice. Take the set of
690240	696560	all possible subsets of the natural numbers called the power set of the naturals. Then a choice function
696560	702720	f for the power set of n chooses a natural number from each possible subset of the naturals.
702720	708960	So the domain is the power set of n and the co-domain is a set of naturals. But we really
708960	714960	don't need the axiom of choice to show that a choice function exists. For example, you can easily
714960	720720	define a choice function by just choosing the smallest element in each subset. By the properties
720720	727600	of the naturals, every subset contains the smallest element. So again, we don't need a c to show that
727600	735040	a choice function exists. But the universe of sets is much, much bigger than the naturals. For
735040	740800	example, the real numbers live in a bigger size of infinity than the naturals called uncountable
740800	747840	infinity. But we can also define bigger infinities by using something called ordinals. In essence,
747840	753600	we can define bigger and bigger infinities by describing what are called different order types
753600	759920	of the same size. It's definitely out of the scope of this video, but the point is sets can get
759920	766800	stupidly unfathomably large. And so if we want to make these uncountably infinite number of choices,
766800	773040	well, we can't just do that using any of our zf axioms. We need the axiom of choice to assume
773040	779120	that we can make these infinitely many choices, no matter how incomprehensibly large our sets
779120	785760	can get. And it turns out that making these choices is necessary even for the most seemingly obvious
785760	792960	theorems about sets. For example, let a function f from x to y be surjective. Remember, it means
792960	799120	all of its co domain is mapped by some element of the domain. Then does this imply that there exists
799120	806240	an injective function g from y to x, that is, a function where two distinct elements of y are
806240	812480	always mapped to distinct elements in x? Well, let's think about this. By the surjectivity of f,
812480	818960	each element in y is mapped by some x in x. So simple. Let's just let g of y be this x.
819920	827120	But wait, there is no guarantee that f is injective. So there could be multiple x's in x
827120	834880	that map to this y. So if x1 and x2 both map to y by f, which one do we choose for our g?
836160	842240	Clearly, we need the axiom of choice to choose, arbitrarily, some element to map y to.
843120	848560	This is how we'd formally state this. Let x sub y be the set of all elements in x such that f
848560	855200	of x is equal to y. So this is the set of x's from which we'd like to choose what to map y to.
855840	860080	Think of like we're watching The Bachelors and this is the set of all candidates for g of y.
860960	867760	Notice that x sub y is a subset of x. Since our choice function, let's call h,
867760	873920	wants to choose an element of this subset, its inputs are the subsets of x. So the domain of
873920	880400	our choice function h can be the set of all subsets of x. That's the power set of x. Remember,
880400	885680	this is the set of all subsets of x. So x sub y is an element of the power set of x.
886320	891680	But recall that ac requires our domain to contain only non-empty sets. So we do have
891680	898480	to remove the empty set, which is technically a subset of x. Okay, then its co-domain is the
898480	905040	union set of p of x. But clearly, this is just x. I mean, everything in here is just a subset of x,
905040	908560	so you dump all of its elements into one big collection, it's just gonna be x.
909360	916960	So the axiom of choice affirms that there exists a choice function h from p of x minus 0 to x.
917760	924720	In particular, h of x sub y will be in x sub y, meaning h of x of y is guaranteed
924720	930000	to be one of our bachelors. So that's how we'll define g. For every y and y,
930000	937520	let g of y just be h of x sub y. Let's show that g is injective. If y is not equal to y prime,
937520	941920	then xy and xy prime must be disjoint, meaning they have no elements in common.
942480	949920	Indeed, if x was in both xy and xy prime, it would mean that f of x equals y and f of x equals y
949920	956000	prime, which contradicts the rules for functions, that each element is mapped to a unique output.
956000	964080	So if xy is disjoint from xy prime, any element in xy is distinct from any element in xy prime.
964080	972960	So g of y equals hxy is not equal to gy prime equals hxy prime. So g is injective.
974160	979760	So that's how you apply the axiom of choice in a proof. And the axiom of choice appears a lot
979760	986240	in mathematics. In fact, it is equivalent over zf to a lot of statements. And when I say that two
986240	992080	statements are equivalent over zf, it means that, assuming all the other axioms of zf,
992080	997440	the statements imply one another. Basically, it means that the statements are the same.
998240	1005120	They are simply different ways of stating the same innate fact. So saying ac is equivalent to
1005120	1011280	some statement means if you want this statement to be true, you will need the axiom of choice.
1011920	1018160	So let's go over some equivalences of ac in set theory. One of the most important equivalences of
1018240	1023440	ac is Zorn's lemma. But before we state Zorn's lemma, we need some preliminaries.
1024080	1029360	Let's say you wanted a way to compare elements of a set x. Then you can define what's called
1029360	1034480	an ordering on that set. It has to satisfy some properties. First, it must be reflexive,
1034480	1039600	meaning every element of x is related to itself. It must also be anti-symmetric,
1039600	1046240	meaning if x is related to y and y is related to x, this means x is equal to y. Finally,
1046320	1051840	it must be transitive, meaning if x is related to y and y is related to z, then x is related to z.
1052800	1057760	A prime example of an ordering is the greater than or equal to relation on the set of numbers
1057760	1062960	like the integers and the reals. In fact, in general, we like to use this notation for
1062960	1067280	orderings on sets, but of course there are many more orderings than just the greater than or equal.
1068000	1073840	For example, take the set inclusion relation, given by a is a subset of p, and the power set
1073840	1081200	of some set. This also satisfies three properties, but here's the thing. You can choose any two numbers,
1081200	1086160	and you'll always be able to compare them with greater than or equal to. But if you choose two
1086160	1093040	elements of a set containing sets, they might not be subsets of one another, like 1, 2, 3,
1093040	1100080	and 2, 3, 4 can't be compared by set inclusion. No worries, such a set with a relation that
1100080	1105680	satisfies the three properties, but not all elements of the set can be compared to every other element
1105680	1112000	is called a partial ordering. And if, like the integers with a greater than or equal to relation,
1112000	1117600	every element can be compared to every other element, that set is called a total ordering.
1119440	1123760	Now let's say that you have a partial ordering on some set, and you want a subset
1123760	1128800	of that set that is a total ordering induced by that same ordering on the whole set.
1129600	1134720	Then such a subset is called a chain, and the chain is a good name for them because
1134720	1141600	elements of such subsets form a chain of ordered elements. Now in general, if you have a subset
1141600	1148240	s of a partially ordered set x, you can define what's called an upper bound of s. This is some
1148240	1155520	element u of x, such that u is greater than or equal to every element in s. Now u doesn't have
1155520	1161840	to be in s, but it could, and there could be multiple upper bounds. For example, an upper bound
1161840	1169760	of the subset 1, 2, 6 in the set of naturals is 7, but also 1000, or maybe 6, or basically all
1169760	1176320	natural numbers greater than or equal to 6. But not all subsets have upper bounds, like take the set
1176320	1182560	of even numbers, which obviously doesn't have an upper bound. No natural number is greater than or
1182560	1189280	equal to every even number. Finally, let's define something called a maximal element of x.
1190000	1196160	An element m of a partially ordered set x is maximal if there is no other element of x that
1196160	1202320	is greater than or equal to m. For example, in the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with the usual greater
1202320	1208480	than or equal to ordering, 5 is a maximal element. But in the set of all natural numbers,
1208480	1216640	well, there is no maximal element. Now we can define Zorn's lemma. Let x be a partially ordered
1216640	1225280	set induced by some relation. Suppose that for every chain c of x, c has an upper bound, then x
1225280	1231840	has a maximal element. A few questions arise pretty quickly. First, where is the axiom of
1231840	1237520	choice in this? This was supposed to be an equivalent statement, yet it looks and feels so
1237520	1244000	different. And also, what really is this statement saying? What is it used for? Let's answer the
1244000	1249280	second question first. A lot of mathematical concepts that you may know are actually maximal
1249280	1254800	elements in disguise. If you know some linear algebra, think about the basis of a vector space.
1254800	1260640	You can pretty easily prove with basic linear algebra that a basis of some vector space v
1260640	1266880	is the maximal element of the set of all linearly independent subsets of v. So,
1266880	1272480	Zorn's lemma can be crucial in proving the existence of some very important mathematical
1272480	1279840	objects. So, how do Zorn's lemma and the axiom of choice relate? Well first, let's try to find
1279840	1285600	ac in Zorn's lemma. In other words, if Zorn's lemma is true, does that mean that we can find
1285600	1293600	a choice function for any set? The answer is yes. Take a set x of non-ante sets, and let a be the
1293600	1298960	set of functions f, or technically rule of assignments, don't worry too much about the semantics,
1298960	1305520	such that its domain is a subset of x, and it satisfies f of x is an x for all x in the domain
1305520	1312000	of f. Well, this set a is a partially ordered set induced by the set inclusion relation.
1312640	1319200	But it turns out that every chain in A has an upper bound. So you can apply Zorn's and show
1319200	1326320	that A has a maximal element. Then you can show that this maximal element is exactly a choice
1326320	1335360	function, or x. Zorn's lemma implies the axiom of choice. How about the other implication? Does ac
1335680	1342880	imply Zorn's? Yeah. But that proof is a lot more complicated. It requires ordinals and a technique
1342880	1348640	called transfinite recursion, which uses the axiom of replacement. The tools required for this proof
1348640	1354080	are beyond the scope of this video, but as a general idea, you take a partially ordered set A
1354080	1359280	where every chain has an upper bound. Then you construct some subset of A by using the axiom
1359280	1365360	of choice to recursively choose what are called strict upper bounds. These are basically elements
1365360	1371360	that are strictly bigger than everything in a subset. Basically, at each step, if your subset
1371360	1377920	still has some strict upper bounds, you choose one and add it to the subset. We do this continuously
1377920	1384400	until the subset we constructed has no more upper bounds. This way, we want to construct a maximal
1384400	1391440	element of A by taking this subset and taking its union set. But because we could have so many choices
1391440	1398560	for such strict upper bounds, we have to use the axiom of choice. This kind of recursion is also
1398560	1404480	not over the naturals, but instead each step is marked by these transfinite objects called the
1404480	1410400	ordinals. You can then use an axiom called replacement to prove that this transfinite recursion
1410400	1418880	must eventually stop. And thus, you have constructed a maximal element using ac. So ac implies zorns.
1420000	1425280	So that's the first important equivalence of ac. But there's another also very important
1425280	1431600	equivalence of ac called the well ordering theorem. Remember the ordering stuff from zorns lemma?
1432160	1436880	Well, let's suppose that a set x has a total ordering, meaning every element can be compared
1436880	1443360	to every other element. Such an ordering is called well founded if every subset of x has
1443360	1448800	what's called a least element, meaning everything in s is greater than or equal to this least element.
1449360	1455520	If a set has a total ordering and is also well founded, we say that the set can be well ordered.
1456400	1461920	For example, the set of naturals with the usual ordering is clearly well ordered. We know that
1462000	1466880	the naturals and their usual ordering is a total ordering. And it's not hard to see that every
1466880	1473360	subset of the naturals must have a least element, because if not, you'd be able to find some infinitely
1473360	1478160	descending subset of the naturals, which cannot happen because, well, you'd have to eventually
1478160	1485520	stop after some finite steps at zero. But what about the integers? Well, it sure has a total
1485520	1490960	ordering under our usual ordering relation, but it's not well founded. Take the subset of all
1491040	1496800	negative integers. It doesn't have a least element. But this doesn't mean the integers
1496800	1502400	can't be well ordered. How about we define a new relation on the integer, where a is less than b,
1502400	1507600	if the absolute value of a is less than the absolute value of b. Now, if the absolute values
1507600	1514000	are equal, and let's say a is not equal to b, then this must mean that b is negative a. So,
1514000	1520000	whichever of a or b is positive, let's order first. So such an ordering would look like this,
1520000	1526480	zero, one, minus one, two, minus two, three, minus three, and so on. Then this ordering
1526480	1532800	is well founded. You can see how our order relation may look a bit weird, but nonetheless,
1532800	1540960	the set can be well ordered. But can we do this for every set? You can, in fact, define a pretty
1540960	1546480	nice well ordering on the rationals and in general, any set that is countable, meaning it has size
1546480	1553520	equal or smaller than the naturals. But when things get uncountably infinite, like the reels,
1553520	1561520	it becomes difficult to find a well ordering. But even so, do we know one can exist? Well,
1561520	1567200	the well ordering theorem says that every set can be well ordered. And it turns out,
1567200	1570560	the well ordering theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice.
1570960	1576320	Like Zorn's lemma showing that the well ordering theorem implies ac is a bit more easier. If we
1576320	1582480	assume the well ordering theorem, take any set of non-empty sets x and look at the union set of x,
1582480	1589280	then the union set of x has a well ordering. In particular, every subset of u of x has a least
1589280	1596960	element by well foundedness. But notice that every element x of x is a subset of the union set of x.
1597680	1605280	So we can define a choice function from x to union set of x, such that f of x is the least
1605280	1612640	element of x as a subset in ux with respect to its well ordering. Well, the least element of x
1612640	1619120	as a subset of the union set of x is obviously in x, so we just defined a choice function for x.
1620160	1624320	On the other hand, showing that ac implies the well ordering theorem is again a bit more
1624400	1629280	complicated. And again, we need stuff like transfinite recursion and ordinals to define
1629280	1634880	a well ordering. But the idea is pretty straightforward. For any set x, you basically
1634880	1640560	use the axiom of choice to choose an element in x. Set that as your least element, then choose
1640560	1645120	another element from the remaining elements in x, that's your next element in our order,
1645120	1650320	then you just continue to do that recursively, again with the weird transfinite recursion done
1650320	1656560	over the ordinals, and again, by the axiom of replacement, it necessitates that we must stop.
1657440	1662720	Then we have basically constructed a well ordering on x. Again, the details are out of
1662720	1668640	the scope of this video, but hopefully you can see the choiceness required for the well ordering
1668640	1675760	theorem. But the equivalences of ac are not just limited to set theory. There are a lot of equivalences
1675760	1682800	to very many important statements outside of set theory. First, every vector space has a basis.
1682800	1687920	If you took any level of linear algebra, this is a foundational statement about vector spaces.
1687920	1693840	When we are given a vector space, we automatically assume it has a basis. It turns out that this
1693840	1702000	theorem is equivalent to ac. Second, that every ring contains a maximal ideal. This is a statement
1702000	1707040	in ring theory, and it's a pretty important statement because maximal ideals are quite useful
1707040	1712560	tools. And like our previous example, it's a foundational theorem in algebra, which is also
1712560	1718000	equivalent to the axiom of choice. Now, these statements might seem a bit disconnected from
1718000	1723440	our first formulation of the axiom of choice about choice functions, but they are quite immediate
1723440	1729840	from our other equivalent formulation, Zorn's lemma. Both a basis of a vector space and a maximal
1729840	1735680	ideal of a ring are just maximal elements under the set inclusion relation. So oftentimes,
1735680	1741600	in abstract algebra, the preferred form of the axiom of choice is Zorn's lemma. Of course,
1741600	1747440	the fact that these statements also imply Zorn's lemma is quite interesting. Another important
1747440	1752880	equivalence of ac is Tykinov's theorem, which states that the product of any collection of
1752880	1759200	compact topological spaces is compact with respect to product topology. It's considered one of the
1759200	1765840	most crucial theorems of a branch of topology called point set topology. And these are but just
1765840	1772880	a few of many examples. So clearly, the axiom of choice is an indispensable theorem of mathematics.
1773600	1778160	If we have the axiom of choice, we can prove these important theorems, and if we want any of
1778160	1784160	these foundational theorems to be true, the axiom of choice must follow. So what's the problem?
1784720	1788160	Why did I say that the axiom of choice is controversial?
1789920	1796080	Well, there are a lot of reasons for this controversy. One comes from the philosophical
1796080	1802560	consequence of accepting the arbitrary existence of these choice functions, maximal elements,
1802560	1809040	well-orderings, without any concrete way to construct or describe these things. We just
1809120	1813840	say that they must exist, but as far as we know, we have no idea what they look like.
1814640	1821120	Another problem occurs with certain implications of ac that seem, well, counterintuitive.
1821120	1826240	Take the Banach-Tarski paradox, which says that you can take a solid 3D unit ball,
1826240	1830800	take it apart into finally many pieces, and using only rotations and translations,
1831360	1837120	assemble the pieces to get two exact copies of the unit ball. I mean, this sounds ridiculous,
1837120	1843840	surely that contradicts all intuition of geometry and volume, but if ac is true,
1843840	1848720	it's always Banach-Tarski. So if we want these really nice theorems and mathematics,
1848720	1852960	like Takanov's theorem, we're going to have to accept stuff like Banach-Tarski.
1853760	1857840	So yes, the axiom of choice breaks our intuition in more ways than one,
1857840	1863280	and this weirdness has garnered some controversy throughout its history. But over time,
1863280	1869360	the majority of mathematicians have agreed to accept ac as a valid axiom to derive the theorems,
1870160	1875840	and as weird as ac might be, it hasn't shown any contradiction so far. But Banach-Tarski,
1875840	1881920	for example, is just a consequence of describing sets so weird that the concept of volume really
1881920	1887120	just falls apart. It may break our intuition, but that's different from a contradiction.
1888160	1893120	But if anything, the axiom of choice shows the chaotic nature of mathematics.
1893680	1897920	Our theorems are not something to be taken for granted. Our truths are often confusing and
1897920	1903920	built upon a foundation not of objectives, but of assumptions we can only hope are strong.
1904960	1910240	But maybe that's the beauty of it. There may be some things we can never truly know the answer to,
1910240	1916800	maybe even some statements that don't have an answer. But we constructed our system of truths
1916800	1923760	and relying only on our intuition and assumptions and logic discovered what the universe had to offer.
1925440	1930960	Even if we know there is a limitation, that doesn't mean we can't reach new heights.
1932080	1936240	Is the axiom of choice true? Does that question even make sense?
1936960	1941920	Are the axioms of ZFC truly free of contradictions? We may never know,
1942720	1947920	but maybe that's not the point. Just being curious, desiring to know more, and pushing
1947920	1953680	ourselves to make sure our truths are truths, that in and of itself allows us to contemplate
1953680	1967040	and debate and imagine and discover. Until next time.
