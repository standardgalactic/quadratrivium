00:00.000 --> 00:16.080
In mathematics, you want to prove things.

00:16.080 --> 00:21.200
Usually take some known theorems and ideas and, by using logic and mathematical techniques,

00:21.200 --> 00:22.880
show something new.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.840
But what lies at the foundation of mathematics?

00:26.080 --> 00:29.120
You prove new statements from statements that you already know,

00:29.120 --> 00:35.280
which themselves were proven from other statements and so on until you reach, well, assumptions.

00:35.920 --> 00:39.440
Stuff we don't really prove, but assume to be true.

00:40.240 --> 00:45.600
In mathematics, we call these axioms, and they lay the foundations of what we can do.

00:46.640 --> 00:53.040
The most widely used system of axioms is called Zermelo-Francole set theory with the axiom of

00:53.040 --> 00:57.360
choice, and these axioms talk specifically about sets.

00:57.360 --> 01:03.200
And the reason this is is because sets are so foundational that it's in everything in mathematics,

01:03.200 --> 01:08.560
from numbers to functions to algebraic structures, which can all be described by sets.

01:09.440 --> 01:14.400
But there's a specific axiom that stands out above the rest, the axiom of choice.

01:15.200 --> 01:19.520
We'll see what it really says about how we make choices in mathematics,

01:19.520 --> 01:24.960
as well as the controversy that this axiom brought, and why, even after all that,

01:24.960 --> 01:27.760
mathematicians hold fast to this axiom.

01:28.640 --> 01:34.800
But first, we need to learn a bit of set theory, because usually when you ask someone what a set

01:34.800 --> 01:38.160
is, they just say a collection of mathematical things.

01:38.160 --> 01:41.520
You know, we can have the set of natural numbers or real numbers.

01:41.520 --> 01:45.440
A basis of the vector space R2 is just a set of vectors.

01:46.080 --> 01:50.960
In fact, basically everything in mathematics, from ordered pairs to functions, relations,

01:50.960 --> 01:54.960
equivalence classes, even numbers themselves, can be described as sets.

01:55.600 --> 02:01.200
So this is why set theory is foundational in all of mathematics, because sets are the building blocks.

02:01.920 --> 02:08.160
So we need a formal set of rules to govern how sets work, or else you might run into contradictions.

02:08.800 --> 02:14.640
For example, consider the set of all sets that does not contain itself, call it R,

02:14.640 --> 02:21.760
then is R contained in R? Well, if R is an R, then it contains itself, so it cannot be an R.

02:22.400 --> 02:28.880
But if R is not an R, then R should now be an R. This is called Russell's Paradox,

02:28.880 --> 02:33.840
which is formulated by Bertrand Russell in 1901 to show that, clearly,

02:33.840 --> 02:37.680
we have to restrict on how we build and talk about sets in some way.

02:38.320 --> 02:43.120
Before this, mathematicians worked with sets and collections in a naive sort of way,

02:43.120 --> 02:48.080
just using assumptions they thought were self-evident. But with Russell's Paradox,

02:48.080 --> 02:53.200
mathematicians realized the necessity to lay down the foundational rules of what a set is,

02:53.200 --> 03:00.560
and its properties. In 1908, Ernst Zermelo formulated a list of axioms to base the theory of sets.

03:00.560 --> 03:05.440
Eventually, other mathematicians like Abraham Frankel and John von Neumann added some other

03:05.440 --> 03:11.440
axioms and eventually formulated Zermelo-Frankel set theory, also known as ZF, along with the

03:11.440 --> 03:18.320
axiom of choice, together called ZFC. We won't go through all of ZF today because that probably

03:18.320 --> 03:23.840
requires a whole series of videos, but this is a quick, informal description of what they say.

03:24.400 --> 03:31.040
Two sets are equal if they have the same elements. There exists the empty set. There exists a set

03:31.040 --> 03:37.360
containing two already existing sets. The union of sets is a set. The collection of all subsets of

03:37.360 --> 03:44.480
a set is a set. A definable sub-collection of a set is a set. There exists an infinite set.

03:45.040 --> 03:52.080
The image of any set under a definable function is a set, and every non-empty set contains a member

03:52.080 --> 03:58.160
that it is disjoint with. Now, some of these you can omit in certain circumstances by following from

03:58.160 --> 04:05.120
other axioms, but this is the general idea of ZF. Now, it's important to note that ZF or axiom of

04:05.120 --> 04:12.400
choice isn't some god-given, infallible, objective mathematical set of rules. You can construct and

04:12.400 --> 04:17.680
define other axiomatic systems and assumptions, which themselves can be useful in building upon

04:17.680 --> 04:24.720
mathematics. But ZF and the axiom of choice is what we use historically, and so far, works pretty well.

04:25.520 --> 04:32.160
So what does ZF say about sets, and what can we build from them? Well, first, from now on,

04:32.160 --> 04:37.120
everything in mathematics is a set, so it's important that we construct the mathematical

04:37.120 --> 04:42.800
concepts that we're familiar with in terms of sets, and we do this by constructing sets with

04:42.800 --> 04:49.360
the same properties that we expect from what we're familiar with. For example, consider the ordered pair

04:49.360 --> 04:55.920
AB, where it's just a collection of two objects with a strict ordering, so AB and BA are not the

04:55.920 --> 05:02.320
same if A and B are not the same. What's the defining property of the ordered pair? Well,

05:02.320 --> 05:07.440
how can we say that two ordered pairs are equal? Well, their first elements must be the same,

05:07.440 --> 05:14.640
and then their second element must also be the same. So, AB is equal to A'B' if and only if

05:14.640 --> 05:20.160
A is equal to A' and B is equal to B'. Can we describe sets with such properties?

05:20.880 --> 05:26.160
Yes, we can in fact formulate multiple constructions, but the widely accepted definition

05:26.160 --> 05:33.840
is a Kurotowski's definition, where AB is this set. It looks a bit wonky, but if you do the math,

05:33.840 --> 05:39.040
you'll get that this set exactly satisfies the defining property of the ordered pair.

05:40.080 --> 05:45.200
Now, defining ordered pairs is important because they help us construct other concepts.

05:45.200 --> 05:50.560
For example, take the Cartesian product of two sets. It's the set of all possible ordered pairs,

05:50.560 --> 05:57.600
AB, such that A is in A and B is in B. For example, the Cartesian product of the natural numbers and

05:57.600 --> 06:03.360
the natural numbers is all possible pairs of natural numbers. Then we can define something

06:03.360 --> 06:09.760
called a relation from sets X to Y. Formally, these are just a subset of the Cartesian product

06:09.760 --> 06:16.080
X times Y. Then we say that some X and X is related to some Y and Y denoted like this,

06:16.080 --> 06:23.360
if X, Y is in this subset R of X times Y. For example, the greater than relation of the natural

06:23.360 --> 06:32.480
numbers is a subset G of N times N. Then 2 comma 1 is an element of G, but 3 comma 7 is not an element

06:32.480 --> 06:39.600
of G. But what if we restrict a relation such that every X and X can be related to exactly

06:39.760 --> 06:47.600
1 Y and Y? Well, this is called a rule of assignment. But let's step back a bit. A rule of assignment

06:47.600 --> 06:54.240
is a set of ordered pairs in X times Y, where each X and X is related, or you can say mapped,

06:54.240 --> 07:00.640
to a unique Y and Y. That, my friends, is just a function. Recall back in grade school how you

07:00.640 --> 07:06.160
described a function as a graph on the Cartesian plane. The graph had to pass the vertical line

07:06.160 --> 07:13.920
test showing that each X element had to be mapped to exactly one Y element. Well, this graph is just

07:13.920 --> 07:19.200
a representation of a set of ordered pairs. Take the real valued function f of X equals

07:19.200 --> 07:25.200
X squared on the reels. We can demonstrate it as a graph where each point on the graph is an ordered

07:25.200 --> 07:30.880
pair. So this graph represents the set of ordered pairs, which is just the rule of assignment defined

07:30.880 --> 07:38.480
by the rule f of X equals X squared. So a function is just a set defined by this rule of assignment.

07:39.360 --> 07:43.760
Functions are at the heart of the axiom of choice, so let's briefly go over a few properties and

07:43.760 --> 07:49.440
definitions. A function is defined between two sets, the domain, which is the set of inputs,

07:49.440 --> 07:54.480
and the co-domain, which contains the set of outputs. In our formal definition, if we have a

07:54.480 --> 07:59.360
rule of assignment as set of ordered pairs, the domain is a set which the first element of the

07:59.360 --> 08:04.640
order pair comes from, and the co-domain is a set in which the second element of each order pair comes

08:04.640 --> 08:09.520
from. Technically speaking, a function is then formally defined as a triple consisting of the

08:09.520 --> 08:13.920
rule of assignment, the domain, and the co-domain, but for simplicity, we can just talk about the

08:13.920 --> 08:19.680
rule of assignment. Indeed, the rule of assignment of a function maps each element of the domain to

08:19.680 --> 08:26.080
a unique element of the co-domain. Notice that the co-domain isn't necessarily the set of all outputs,

08:26.080 --> 08:30.560
that would be the image of the function. Like for f of x equals x squared,

08:30.560 --> 08:35.360
not all real numbers are outputs of this function, in particular the negative numbers.

08:35.360 --> 08:40.960
If a function does map to all of the co-domain, such that the range is the co-domain, the function

08:40.960 --> 08:47.040
is called surjective, or onto. Now, looking at the domain, while each element can only be mapped

08:47.040 --> 08:52.800
to one element in the co-domain, it doesn't mean two elements of the domain might end up mapping

08:52.800 --> 08:58.560
to the same element in the co-domain. In our f of x equals x squared example, negative two and

08:58.560 --> 09:05.200
positive two map to the same element, four. But if it happens that distinct elements in the domain

09:05.200 --> 09:10.480
are mapped to distinct elements in the co-domain, then that function is called injective, or one

09:10.480 --> 09:17.040
to one. If a function is both surjective and injective, such a function is called bijective.

09:17.680 --> 09:22.000
There's a lot more we can dig into, but I think we're ready for a formal approach

09:22.000 --> 09:27.840
to the axiom of choice. Take a set x, which is a collection of sets which are non-empty,

09:27.840 --> 09:34.000
meaning each element of x is a set that contains something. The axiom of choice says that there

09:34.000 --> 09:41.760
is a function which, for every set in x, chooses an element inside that set. Such a function is

09:41.760 --> 09:48.640
called a choice function of x. When you hear like that, it seems a bit underwhelming, but let's

09:48.640 --> 09:54.800
look at the machinery of what's going on here. So our domain is a set of these non-empty sets,

09:54.800 --> 10:00.800
then our co-domain is a set of all the elements in each of these sets, since our output will always

10:00.800 --> 10:08.160
be in one of these sets. So the co-domain is a union of all these non-empty sets. Just imagine

10:08.160 --> 10:14.480
that these non-empty sets in x are boxes containing some mathematical things, then our co-domain is

10:14.480 --> 10:20.880
just a big box where you dump all the contents of these boxes into. Then the co-domain is a set of

10:20.880 --> 10:27.520
all the possible elements we can choose from, and our choice function chooses one for each element of

10:27.520 --> 10:34.240
x. We call this the union set of x, which we can also denote with the big union symbol like this.

10:35.200 --> 10:41.920
Then we say that there is a function from x to the union set of x, such that f of x is in x for

10:41.920 --> 10:51.840
each x and big x. So f of x basically chooses an element in the non-empty set x. Now the axiom of

10:51.840 --> 10:56.960
choice doesn't actually give us a way to find this function or what this function looks like.

10:56.960 --> 11:04.640
It just declares that for any set of non-empty sets x, such a function must exist. So why is this

11:04.640 --> 11:11.520
axiom so important or even necessary? It feels, well, a bit obvious. Well, that's because most

11:11.520 --> 11:17.040
of us live in a finite mindset. If we have a finite number of sets, we can easily prove that such a

11:17.040 --> 11:23.200
choice function must exist using a technique called induction. You don't need an axiom to make finite

11:23.200 --> 11:30.240
choices. In fact, even some infinite choices don't really need the axiom of choice. Take the set of

11:30.240 --> 11:36.560
all possible subsets of the natural numbers called the power set of the naturals. Then a choice function

11:36.560 --> 11:42.720
f for the power set of n chooses a natural number from each possible subset of the naturals.

11:42.720 --> 11:48.960
So the domain is the power set of n and the co-domain is a set of naturals. But we really

11:48.960 --> 11:54.960
don't need the axiom of choice to show that a choice function exists. For example, you can easily

11:54.960 --> 12:00.720
define a choice function by just choosing the smallest element in each subset. By the properties

12:00.720 --> 12:07.600
of the naturals, every subset contains the smallest element. So again, we don't need a c to show that

12:07.600 --> 12:15.040
a choice function exists. But the universe of sets is much, much bigger than the naturals. For

12:15.040 --> 12:20.800
example, the real numbers live in a bigger size of infinity than the naturals called uncountable

12:20.800 --> 12:27.840
infinity. But we can also define bigger infinities by using something called ordinals. In essence,

12:27.840 --> 12:33.600
we can define bigger and bigger infinities by describing what are called different order types

12:33.600 --> 12:39.920
of the same size. It's definitely out of the scope of this video, but the point is sets can get

12:39.920 --> 12:46.800
stupidly unfathomably large. And so if we want to make these uncountably infinite number of choices,

12:46.800 --> 12:53.040
well, we can't just do that using any of our zf axioms. We need the axiom of choice to assume

12:53.040 --> 12:59.120
that we can make these infinitely many choices, no matter how incomprehensibly large our sets

12:59.120 --> 13:05.760
can get. And it turns out that making these choices is necessary even for the most seemingly obvious

13:05.760 --> 13:12.960
theorems about sets. For example, let a function f from x to y be surjective. Remember, it means

13:12.960 --> 13:19.120
all of its co domain is mapped by some element of the domain. Then does this imply that there exists

13:19.120 --> 13:26.240
an injective function g from y to x, that is, a function where two distinct elements of y are

13:26.240 --> 13:32.480
always mapped to distinct elements in x? Well, let's think about this. By the surjectivity of f,

13:32.480 --> 13:38.960
each element in y is mapped by some x in x. So simple. Let's just let g of y be this x.

13:39.920 --> 13:47.120
But wait, there is no guarantee that f is injective. So there could be multiple x's in x

13:47.120 --> 13:54.880
that map to this y. So if x1 and x2 both map to y by f, which one do we choose for our g?

13:56.160 --> 14:02.240
Clearly, we need the axiom of choice to choose, arbitrarily, some element to map y to.

14:03.120 --> 14:08.560
This is how we'd formally state this. Let x sub y be the set of all elements in x such that f

14:08.560 --> 14:15.200
of x is equal to y. So this is the set of x's from which we'd like to choose what to map y to.

14:15.840 --> 14:20.080
Think of like we're watching The Bachelors and this is the set of all candidates for g of y.

14:20.960 --> 14:27.760
Notice that x sub y is a subset of x. Since our choice function, let's call h,

14:27.760 --> 14:33.920
wants to choose an element of this subset, its inputs are the subsets of x. So the domain of

14:33.920 --> 14:40.400
our choice function h can be the set of all subsets of x. That's the power set of x. Remember,

14:40.400 --> 14:45.680
this is the set of all subsets of x. So x sub y is an element of the power set of x.

14:46.320 --> 14:51.680
But recall that ac requires our domain to contain only non-empty sets. So we do have

14:51.680 --> 14:58.480
to remove the empty set, which is technically a subset of x. Okay, then its co-domain is the

14:58.480 --> 15:05.040
union set of p of x. But clearly, this is just x. I mean, everything in here is just a subset of x,

15:05.040 --> 15:08.560
so you dump all of its elements into one big collection, it's just gonna be x.

15:09.360 --> 15:16.960
So the axiom of choice affirms that there exists a choice function h from p of x minus 0 to x.

15:17.760 --> 15:24.720
In particular, h of x sub y will be in x sub y, meaning h of x of y is guaranteed

15:24.720 --> 15:30.000
to be one of our bachelors. So that's how we'll define g. For every y and y,

15:30.000 --> 15:37.520
let g of y just be h of x sub y. Let's show that g is injective. If y is not equal to y prime,

15:37.520 --> 15:41.920
then xy and xy prime must be disjoint, meaning they have no elements in common.

15:42.480 --> 15:49.920
Indeed, if x was in both xy and xy prime, it would mean that f of x equals y and f of x equals y

15:49.920 --> 15:56.000
prime, which contradicts the rules for functions, that each element is mapped to a unique output.

15:56.000 --> 16:04.080
So if xy is disjoint from xy prime, any element in xy is distinct from any element in xy prime.

16:04.080 --> 16:12.960
So g of y equals hxy is not equal to gy prime equals hxy prime. So g is injective.

16:14.160 --> 16:19.760
So that's how you apply the axiom of choice in a proof. And the axiom of choice appears a lot

16:19.760 --> 16:26.240
in mathematics. In fact, it is equivalent over zf to a lot of statements. And when I say that two

16:26.240 --> 16:32.080
statements are equivalent over zf, it means that, assuming all the other axioms of zf,

16:32.080 --> 16:37.440
the statements imply one another. Basically, it means that the statements are the same.

16:38.240 --> 16:45.120
They are simply different ways of stating the same innate fact. So saying ac is equivalent to

16:45.120 --> 16:51.280
some statement means if you want this statement to be true, you will need the axiom of choice.

16:51.920 --> 16:58.160
So let's go over some equivalences of ac in set theory. One of the most important equivalences of

16:58.240 --> 17:03.440
ac is Zorn's lemma. But before we state Zorn's lemma, we need some preliminaries.

17:04.080 --> 17:09.360
Let's say you wanted a way to compare elements of a set x. Then you can define what's called

17:09.360 --> 17:14.480
an ordering on that set. It has to satisfy some properties. First, it must be reflexive,

17:14.480 --> 17:19.600
meaning every element of x is related to itself. It must also be anti-symmetric,

17:19.600 --> 17:26.240
meaning if x is related to y and y is related to x, this means x is equal to y. Finally,

17:26.320 --> 17:31.840
it must be transitive, meaning if x is related to y and y is related to z, then x is related to z.

17:32.800 --> 17:37.760
A prime example of an ordering is the greater than or equal to relation on the set of numbers

17:37.760 --> 17:42.960
like the integers and the reals. In fact, in general, we like to use this notation for

17:42.960 --> 17:47.280
orderings on sets, but of course there are many more orderings than just the greater than or equal.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.840
For example, take the set inclusion relation, given by a is a subset of p, and the power set

17:53.840 --> 18:01.200
of some set. This also satisfies three properties, but here's the thing. You can choose any two numbers,

18:01.200 --> 18:06.160
and you'll always be able to compare them with greater than or equal to. But if you choose two

18:06.160 --> 18:13.040
elements of a set containing sets, they might not be subsets of one another, like 1, 2, 3,

18:13.040 --> 18:20.080
and 2, 3, 4 can't be compared by set inclusion. No worries, such a set with a relation that

18:20.080 --> 18:25.680
satisfies the three properties, but not all elements of the set can be compared to every other element

18:25.680 --> 18:32.000
is called a partial ordering. And if, like the integers with a greater than or equal to relation,

18:32.000 --> 18:37.600
every element can be compared to every other element, that set is called a total ordering.

18:39.440 --> 18:43.760
Now let's say that you have a partial ordering on some set, and you want a subset

18:43.760 --> 18:48.800
of that set that is a total ordering induced by that same ordering on the whole set.

18:49.600 --> 18:54.720
Then such a subset is called a chain, and the chain is a good name for them because

18:54.720 --> 19:01.600
elements of such subsets form a chain of ordered elements. Now in general, if you have a subset

19:01.600 --> 19:08.240
s of a partially ordered set x, you can define what's called an upper bound of s. This is some

19:08.240 --> 19:15.520
element u of x, such that u is greater than or equal to every element in s. Now u doesn't have

19:15.520 --> 19:21.840
to be in s, but it could, and there could be multiple upper bounds. For example, an upper bound

19:21.840 --> 19:29.760
of the subset 1, 2, 6 in the set of naturals is 7, but also 1000, or maybe 6, or basically all

19:29.760 --> 19:36.320
natural numbers greater than or equal to 6. But not all subsets have upper bounds, like take the set

19:36.320 --> 19:42.560
of even numbers, which obviously doesn't have an upper bound. No natural number is greater than or

19:42.560 --> 19:49.280
equal to every even number. Finally, let's define something called a maximal element of x.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.160
An element m of a partially ordered set x is maximal if there is no other element of x that

19:56.160 --> 20:02.320
is greater than or equal to m. For example, in the set 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with the usual greater

20:02.320 --> 20:08.480
than or equal to ordering, 5 is a maximal element. But in the set of all natural numbers,

20:08.480 --> 20:16.640
well, there is no maximal element. Now we can define Zorn's lemma. Let x be a partially ordered

20:16.640 --> 20:25.280
set induced by some relation. Suppose that for every chain c of x, c has an upper bound, then x

20:25.280 --> 20:31.840
has a maximal element. A few questions arise pretty quickly. First, where is the axiom of

20:31.840 --> 20:37.520
choice in this? This was supposed to be an equivalent statement, yet it looks and feels so

20:37.520 --> 20:44.000
different. And also, what really is this statement saying? What is it used for? Let's answer the

20:44.000 --> 20:49.280
second question first. A lot of mathematical concepts that you may know are actually maximal

20:49.280 --> 20:54.800
elements in disguise. If you know some linear algebra, think about the basis of a vector space.

20:54.800 --> 21:00.640
You can pretty easily prove with basic linear algebra that a basis of some vector space v

21:00.640 --> 21:06.880
is the maximal element of the set of all linearly independent subsets of v. So,

21:06.880 --> 21:12.480
Zorn's lemma can be crucial in proving the existence of some very important mathematical

21:12.480 --> 21:19.840
objects. So, how do Zorn's lemma and the axiom of choice relate? Well first, let's try to find

21:19.840 --> 21:25.600
ac in Zorn's lemma. In other words, if Zorn's lemma is true, does that mean that we can find

21:25.600 --> 21:33.600
a choice function for any set? The answer is yes. Take a set x of non-ante sets, and let a be the

21:33.600 --> 21:38.960
set of functions f, or technically rule of assignments, don't worry too much about the semantics,

21:38.960 --> 21:45.520
such that its domain is a subset of x, and it satisfies f of x is an x for all x in the domain

21:45.520 --> 21:52.000
of f. Well, this set a is a partially ordered set induced by the set inclusion relation.

21:52.640 --> 21:59.200
But it turns out that every chain in A has an upper bound. So you can apply Zorn's and show

21:59.200 --> 22:06.320
that A has a maximal element. Then you can show that this maximal element is exactly a choice

22:06.320 --> 22:15.360
function, or x. Zorn's lemma implies the axiom of choice. How about the other implication? Does ac

22:15.680 --> 22:22.880
imply Zorn's? Yeah. But that proof is a lot more complicated. It requires ordinals and a technique

22:22.880 --> 22:28.640
called transfinite recursion, which uses the axiom of replacement. The tools required for this proof

22:28.640 --> 22:34.080
are beyond the scope of this video, but as a general idea, you take a partially ordered set A

22:34.080 --> 22:39.280
where every chain has an upper bound. Then you construct some subset of A by using the axiom

22:39.280 --> 22:45.360
of choice to recursively choose what are called strict upper bounds. These are basically elements

22:45.360 --> 22:51.360
that are strictly bigger than everything in a subset. Basically, at each step, if your subset

22:51.360 --> 22:57.920
still has some strict upper bounds, you choose one and add it to the subset. We do this continuously

22:57.920 --> 23:04.400
until the subset we constructed has no more upper bounds. This way, we want to construct a maximal

23:04.400 --> 23:11.440
element of A by taking this subset and taking its union set. But because we could have so many choices

23:11.440 --> 23:18.560
for such strict upper bounds, we have to use the axiom of choice. This kind of recursion is also

23:18.560 --> 23:24.480
not over the naturals, but instead each step is marked by these transfinite objects called the

23:24.480 --> 23:30.400
ordinals. You can then use an axiom called replacement to prove that this transfinite recursion

23:30.400 --> 23:38.880
must eventually stop. And thus, you have constructed a maximal element using ac. So ac implies zorns.

23:40.000 --> 23:45.280
So that's the first important equivalence of ac. But there's another also very important

23:45.280 --> 23:51.600
equivalence of ac called the well ordering theorem. Remember the ordering stuff from zorns lemma?

23:52.160 --> 23:56.880
Well, let's suppose that a set x has a total ordering, meaning every element can be compared

23:56.880 --> 24:03.360
to every other element. Such an ordering is called well founded if every subset of x has

24:03.360 --> 24:08.800
what's called a least element, meaning everything in s is greater than or equal to this least element.

24:09.360 --> 24:15.520
If a set has a total ordering and is also well founded, we say that the set can be well ordered.

24:16.400 --> 24:21.920
For example, the set of naturals with the usual ordering is clearly well ordered. We know that

24:22.000 --> 24:26.880
the naturals and their usual ordering is a total ordering. And it's not hard to see that every

24:26.880 --> 24:33.360
subset of the naturals must have a least element, because if not, you'd be able to find some infinitely

24:33.360 --> 24:38.160
descending subset of the naturals, which cannot happen because, well, you'd have to eventually

24:38.160 --> 24:45.520
stop after some finite steps at zero. But what about the integers? Well, it sure has a total

24:45.520 --> 24:50.960
ordering under our usual ordering relation, but it's not well founded. Take the subset of all

24:51.040 --> 24:56.800
negative integers. It doesn't have a least element. But this doesn't mean the integers

24:56.800 --> 25:02.400
can't be well ordered. How about we define a new relation on the integer, where a is less than b,

25:02.400 --> 25:07.600
if the absolute value of a is less than the absolute value of b. Now, if the absolute values

25:07.600 --> 25:14.000
are equal, and let's say a is not equal to b, then this must mean that b is negative a. So,

25:14.000 --> 25:20.000
whichever of a or b is positive, let's order first. So such an ordering would look like this,

25:20.000 --> 25:26.480
zero, one, minus one, two, minus two, three, minus three, and so on. Then this ordering

25:26.480 --> 25:32.800
is well founded. You can see how our order relation may look a bit weird, but nonetheless,

25:32.800 --> 25:40.960
the set can be well ordered. But can we do this for every set? You can, in fact, define a pretty

25:40.960 --> 25:46.480
nice well ordering on the rationals and in general, any set that is countable, meaning it has size

25:46.480 --> 25:53.520
equal or smaller than the naturals. But when things get uncountably infinite, like the reels,

25:53.520 --> 26:01.520
it becomes difficult to find a well ordering. But even so, do we know one can exist? Well,

26:01.520 --> 26:07.200
the well ordering theorem says that every set can be well ordered. And it turns out,

26:07.200 --> 26:10.560
the well ordering theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice.

26:10.960 --> 26:16.320
Like Zorn's lemma showing that the well ordering theorem implies ac is a bit more easier. If we

26:16.320 --> 26:22.480
assume the well ordering theorem, take any set of non-empty sets x and look at the union set of x,

26:22.480 --> 26:29.280
then the union set of x has a well ordering. In particular, every subset of u of x has a least

26:29.280 --> 26:36.960
element by well foundedness. But notice that every element x of x is a subset of the union set of x.

26:37.680 --> 26:45.280
So we can define a choice function from x to union set of x, such that f of x is the least

26:45.280 --> 26:52.640
element of x as a subset in ux with respect to its well ordering. Well, the least element of x

26:52.640 --> 26:59.120
as a subset of the union set of x is obviously in x, so we just defined a choice function for x.

27:00.160 --> 27:04.320
On the other hand, showing that ac implies the well ordering theorem is again a bit more

27:04.400 --> 27:09.280
complicated. And again, we need stuff like transfinite recursion and ordinals to define

27:09.280 --> 27:14.880
a well ordering. But the idea is pretty straightforward. For any set x, you basically

27:14.880 --> 27:20.560
use the axiom of choice to choose an element in x. Set that as your least element, then choose

27:20.560 --> 27:25.120
another element from the remaining elements in x, that's your next element in our order,

27:25.120 --> 27:30.320
then you just continue to do that recursively, again with the weird transfinite recursion done

27:30.320 --> 27:36.560
over the ordinals, and again, by the axiom of replacement, it necessitates that we must stop.

27:37.440 --> 27:42.720
Then we have basically constructed a well ordering on x. Again, the details are out of

27:42.720 --> 27:48.640
the scope of this video, but hopefully you can see the choiceness required for the well ordering

27:48.640 --> 27:55.760
theorem. But the equivalences of ac are not just limited to set theory. There are a lot of equivalences

27:55.760 --> 28:02.800
to very many important statements outside of set theory. First, every vector space has a basis.

28:02.800 --> 28:07.920
If you took any level of linear algebra, this is a foundational statement about vector spaces.

28:07.920 --> 28:13.840
When we are given a vector space, we automatically assume it has a basis. It turns out that this

28:13.840 --> 28:22.000
theorem is equivalent to ac. Second, that every ring contains a maximal ideal. This is a statement

28:22.000 --> 28:27.040
in ring theory, and it's a pretty important statement because maximal ideals are quite useful

28:27.040 --> 28:32.560
tools. And like our previous example, it's a foundational theorem in algebra, which is also

28:32.560 --> 28:38.000
equivalent to the axiom of choice. Now, these statements might seem a bit disconnected from

28:38.000 --> 28:43.440
our first formulation of the axiom of choice about choice functions, but they are quite immediate

28:43.440 --> 28:49.840
from our other equivalent formulation, Zorn's lemma. Both a basis of a vector space and a maximal

28:49.840 --> 28:55.680
ideal of a ring are just maximal elements under the set inclusion relation. So oftentimes,

28:55.680 --> 29:01.600
in abstract algebra, the preferred form of the axiom of choice is Zorn's lemma. Of course,

29:01.600 --> 29:07.440
the fact that these statements also imply Zorn's lemma is quite interesting. Another important

29:07.440 --> 29:12.880
equivalence of ac is Tykinov's theorem, which states that the product of any collection of

29:12.880 --> 29:19.200
compact topological spaces is compact with respect to product topology. It's considered one of the

29:19.200 --> 29:25.840
most crucial theorems of a branch of topology called point set topology. And these are but just

29:25.840 --> 29:32.880
a few of many examples. So clearly, the axiom of choice is an indispensable theorem of mathematics.

29:33.600 --> 29:38.160
If we have the axiom of choice, we can prove these important theorems, and if we want any of

29:38.160 --> 29:44.160
these foundational theorems to be true, the axiom of choice must follow. So what's the problem?

29:44.720 --> 29:48.160
Why did I say that the axiom of choice is controversial?

29:49.920 --> 29:56.080
Well, there are a lot of reasons for this controversy. One comes from the philosophical

29:56.080 --> 30:02.560
consequence of accepting the arbitrary existence of these choice functions, maximal elements,

30:02.560 --> 30:09.040
well-orderings, without any concrete way to construct or describe these things. We just

30:09.120 --> 30:13.840
say that they must exist, but as far as we know, we have no idea what they look like.

30:14.640 --> 30:21.120
Another problem occurs with certain implications of ac that seem, well, counterintuitive.

30:21.120 --> 30:26.240
Take the Banach-Tarski paradox, which says that you can take a solid 3D unit ball,

30:26.240 --> 30:30.800
take it apart into finally many pieces, and using only rotations and translations,

30:31.360 --> 30:37.120
assemble the pieces to get two exact copies of the unit ball. I mean, this sounds ridiculous,

30:37.120 --> 30:43.840
surely that contradicts all intuition of geometry and volume, but if ac is true,

30:43.840 --> 30:48.720
it's always Banach-Tarski. So if we want these really nice theorems and mathematics,

30:48.720 --> 30:52.960
like Takanov's theorem, we're going to have to accept stuff like Banach-Tarski.

30:53.760 --> 30:57.840
So yes, the axiom of choice breaks our intuition in more ways than one,

30:57.840 --> 31:03.280
and this weirdness has garnered some controversy throughout its history. But over time,

31:03.280 --> 31:09.360
the majority of mathematicians have agreed to accept ac as a valid axiom to derive the theorems,

31:10.160 --> 31:15.840
and as weird as ac might be, it hasn't shown any contradiction so far. But Banach-Tarski,

31:15.840 --> 31:21.920
for example, is just a consequence of describing sets so weird that the concept of volume really

31:21.920 --> 31:27.120
just falls apart. It may break our intuition, but that's different from a contradiction.

31:28.160 --> 31:33.120
But if anything, the axiom of choice shows the chaotic nature of mathematics.

31:33.680 --> 31:37.920
Our theorems are not something to be taken for granted. Our truths are often confusing and

31:37.920 --> 31:43.920
built upon a foundation not of objectives, but of assumptions we can only hope are strong.

31:44.960 --> 31:50.240
But maybe that's the beauty of it. There may be some things we can never truly know the answer to,

31:50.240 --> 31:56.800
maybe even some statements that don't have an answer. But we constructed our system of truths

31:56.800 --> 32:03.760
and relying only on our intuition and assumptions and logic discovered what the universe had to offer.

32:05.440 --> 32:10.960
Even if we know there is a limitation, that doesn't mean we can't reach new heights.

32:12.080 --> 32:16.240
Is the axiom of choice true? Does that question even make sense?

32:16.960 --> 32:21.920
Are the axioms of ZFC truly free of contradictions? We may never know,

32:22.720 --> 32:27.920
but maybe that's not the point. Just being curious, desiring to know more, and pushing

32:27.920 --> 32:33.680
ourselves to make sure our truths are truths, that in and of itself allows us to contemplate

32:33.680 --> 32:47.040
and debate and imagine and discover. Until next time.
