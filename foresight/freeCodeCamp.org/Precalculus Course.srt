00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,560
This video introduces functions and their domains and ranges.

2
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:30,400
A function is a correspondence between input numbers, usually the x values, and output numbers,

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,680
usually the y values, that sends each input number to exactly one output number. Sometimes a

4
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:46,720
function is thought of as a rule or machine in which you can feed in x values as input and get

5
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,840
out y values as output. So a non-mathematical example of a function might be the biological

6
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,280
mother function, which takes as input any person and gives as output their biological mother.

7
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,960
This function satisfies the condition that each input number object person in this case

8
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,400
gets sent to exactly one output person, because if you take any person they just have

9
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,320
one biological mother. So that rule does give you a function, but if I change things around

10
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:30,640
and just use the mother function, which sends to each person their mother, that's no longer

11
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,560
going to be a function because there are some people who have more than one mother, right? They

12
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,360
could have a biological mother and adopted mother or a mother and a stepmother or any

13
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,520
number of situations. So since there's at least some people who you would put it as input and then

14
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,080
you'd get like more than one possible output, that violates this rule of functions. It would not be a

15
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,040
function. Now most of the time we'll work with functions that are described with equations,

16
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,480
not in terms of mothers. So for example, we could have the function y equals x squared plus one.

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,200
This can also be written as f of x equals x squared plus one. Here f of x is function notation

18
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:17,120
that stands for the output value of y. Notice that this notation is not representing multiplication.

19
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,000
We're not multiplying f by x. Instead, we're going to be putting in a value for x's input

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,360
and getting out a value of f of x or y. For example, if we want to evaluate f of two,

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,800
we're plugging in two as input for x either in this equation or in that equation. Since

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,360
f of two means two squared plus one f of two is going to equal five. Similarly, f of five means

23
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:58,560
I plug in five for x. So that's going to be five squared plus one or 26. Sometimes it's useful

24
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,680
to evaluate a function on a more complicated expression involving other variables. In this

25
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,200
case, remember, the functions value on any expression is just when you what you get when you

26
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:18,480
plug in that whole expression for x. So f of a plus three is going to be the quantity a plus

27
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:28,080
three squared plus one. We could rewrite that as a squared plus six a plus nine plus one,

28
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,600
or a squared plus six a plus 10. When evaluating a function on a complex expression, it's important

29
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:42,480
to keep the parentheses when you plug in for x. That way, you evaluate the function on the whole

30
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:52,960
expression. For example, it would be wrong to write f of a plus three equals a plus three

31
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,800
squared plus one without the parentheses, because that would imply that we were just

32
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:06,000
squaring the three and not the whole expression a plus three. Sometimes a function is described

33
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,160
with a graph instead of an equation. In this example, this graph is supposed to represent

34
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,680
the function g of x. Not all graphs actually represent functions. For example, the graph

35
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,680
of a circle doesn't represent a function. That's because the graph of a circle violates the vertical

36
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,720
line test, you can draw a vertical line, and I'll intersect the graph in more than one point.

37
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,320
But our graph at left satisfies the vertical line test, any vertical line intersects the graph and

38
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,320
at most one point. That means it's a function, because every x value will have at most one y

39
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:51,280
value that corresponds to it. Let's evaluate g of two. Note that two is an x value. And we'll use

40
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,800
the graph to find the corresponding y value. So I look for two on the x axis, and find the point

41
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,560
on the graph that has that x value. That's right here. Now I can look at the y value of that point,

42
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,920
looks like three, and therefore g of two is equal to three. If I try to do the same thing to evaluate

43
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:21,520
g of five, I run into trouble. Five is an x value, I look for it on the x axis, but there's no point

44
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:31,200
on the graph that has that x value. Therefore, g of five is undefined, or we can say it does not

45
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,440
exist. The question of what x values and y values make sense for a function leads us to a discussion

46
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,240
of domain and range. The domain of a function is all possible x values that make sense for that

47
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,800
function. The range is the y values that make sense for the function. In this example, we saw

48
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,760
that the x value of five didn't have a corresponding y value for this function. So the x value of five

49
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:04,240
is not in the domain of our function g. To find the x values in the domain, we have to look at

50
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,720
the x values that correspond to points on the graph. When we do that is to take the shadow

51
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:18,560
or projection of the graph onto the x axis, and see what x values are hit. It looks like we're

52
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:26,560
hitting all x values starting at negative eight and continuing up to four. So our domain

53
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,920
is the x's between negative eight and four, including those endpoints, or we can write this

54
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:40,720
in interval notation as negative eight comma four with square brackets. To find the range of the

55
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,160
function, we look for the y values corresponding to points on this graph. We can do that

56
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,080
by taking the shadow or projection of the graph onto the y axis.

57
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:04,880
We seem to be hitting all y values from negative five up through three. So our range

58
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,040
is wise between negative five and three, or an interval notation negative five three

59
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,720
with square brackets. If we meet a function that's described as an equation instead of a graph,

60
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,280
one way to find the domain and range are to graph the function. But it's often possible to find the

61
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,280
domain at least more quickly by using algebraic considerations. We think about what x values

62
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,480
it makes sense to plug into this expression, and what x values need to be excluded because they

63
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,320
make the algebraic expression impossible to evaluate. Specifically, to find the domain of a function,

64
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:50,960
we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero, since we can't divide by zero.

65
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:59,760
We also need to exclude x values that make an expression inside a square root sign negative,

66
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,320
since we can't take the square root of a negative number. In fact, we need to exclude

67
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,800
values that make expression inside any even root negative, because we can't take an even root of

68
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,120
a negative number, even though we can take an odd root like a cube root of a negative number.

69
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,240
Later, when we look at logarithmic functions, we'll have some additional exclusions that we

70
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,240
have to make. But for now, these two principles should handle all functions we'll see. So let's

71
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,200
apply them to a couple examples. For the function in part a, we don't have any square root signs,

72
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,440
but we do have a denominator. So we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero. In other

73
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:48,960
words, we need x squared minus four x plus three to not be equal to zero. If we solve x squared minus

74
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:57,040
four x plus three equal to zero, we can do that by factoring. And that gives us x equals three or

75
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,920
x equals one. So we need to exclude these values. All other x values should be fine. So if I draw

76
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:11,280
the number line, I can put on one and three and just dig out a hole at both of those. And

77
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:18,080
my domain includes everything else on the number line. In interval notation, this means my domain

78
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,160
is everything from negative infinity to one together with everything from one to three together

79
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:31,040
with everything from three to infinity. In this second example, we don't have any

80
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,240
denominator to worry about, but we do have a square root sign. So we need to exclude any x values

81
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,840
that make three minus two x less than zero. In other words, we can include all x values for

82
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:52,240
which three minus two x is greater than or equal to zero. Solving that inequality gives us three is

83
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:00,960
greater than or equal to two x. In other words, x is less than or equal to three halves. I can

84
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:08,800
draw this on the number line, or write it in interval notation. Notice that three halves is

85
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,120
included. And that's because three minus two x is allowed to be zero, I can take the square root of

86
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,200
zero, it's just zero. And that's not a problem. Finally, let's look at a more complicated function

87
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,080
that involves both a square root and a denominator. Now there are two things I need to worry about.

88
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:36,240
I need the denominator to not be equal to zero. And I need the stuff inside the square root sign

89
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,760
to be greater than or equal to zero. From our earlier work, we know that the first condition

90
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,160
means that x is not equal to three, and x is not equal to one. And the second condition

91
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,920
means that x is less than or equal to three halves. Let's draw both of those conditions

92
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:01,600
on the number line. x is not equal to three and x is not equal to one means we've got everything

93
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,880
except those two dug out points. And the other condition x is less than or equal to three halves

94
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:15,760
means we can have three halves and everything to the left of it. Now to be in our domain and to be

95
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,000
legit for our function, we need both of these conditions to be true. So I'm going to connect

96
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,200
these conditions with an and. And that means we're looking for numbers on the number line that are

97
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,160
colored both red and blue. So I'll draw that above in purple. So that's everything from three halves

98
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,240
to one, I have to dig out one because one was a problem for the denominator. And then I can continue

99
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,160
for all the things that are colored both, both colors red and blue. So my final domain is going

100
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:52,880
to be, let's see, negative infinity up to but not including one together with one, but not including

101
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,160
it to three halves and I include three halves since that was colored both red and blue also.

102
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,480
In this video, we talked about functions, how to evaluate them, and how to find domains and ranges.

103
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,040
This video is a brief introduction to increasing and decreasing functions based on their graphs.

104
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,360
In this first example, I've graphed two lines. The first line is an increasing function.

105
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:24,960
Because as the x values go from left to right, the y values are going up.

106
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,440
This can be written more formally by saying if x two is bigger than x one, these are supposed to

107
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,680
be x values. So that means that x two is some x value that's to the right, so that it's bigger.

108
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,320
The next one. So whenever we have an x value x two that's bigger than x one, increasing means

109
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:58,080
that f of x two has to be bigger than f of x one, so that the y values are getting bigger

110
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:04,800
when the x values are bigger. The second line is an example of a decreasing function.

111
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,960
Because here as the x values increase from left to right, the y values are going down.

112
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,880
So again, we can write this more formally by saying that whenever we have an x value x two

113
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,120
that's bigger than x one, for example, this might be x two and this might be x one, then

114
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:36,560
the y value f of x two is less than f of x one this time, because here, when we have a bigger x

115
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:44,320
value, we want to have a smaller y value to be decreasing. This second example gives the graph

116
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,480
of a function that's increasing in some places, but decreasing in others. This part of the graph,

117
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,360
here, the function's decreasing, because as the x values increase from left to right, the y values

118
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:05,360
go down. Over here, we also have a part of the graph where the function is decreasing. Now, this

119
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,160
part of the graph, the function's increasing, because as x goes from left to right, the y values

120
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:17,200
are going up. I'll mark that one in green for increasing. And finally, on this part of the

121
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,440
graph, the functions neither increasing nor decreasing is completely flat or constant.

122
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,720
Now, we're asked to describe the intervals on which the graph is increasing or decreasing.

123
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,440
So we describe those intervals in terms of the x values. It wouldn't make sense to describe them

124
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,520
in terms of the y values, because the y values can be the same for different parts of the graph,

125
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:45,680
but the x values are always unique. To describe where this function is decreasing,

126
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:54,480
that's for x values between negative four and negative two, and between four and seven.

127
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,360
I can write this using inequalities as negative four less than x less than negative two,

128
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,400
four less than x less than seven. It's not important whether I use less than or less than

129
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:15,280
or equal to signs here. I'm going to use less than or equal to signs at the end points of the

130
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,880
function's domain, where the function stops existing altogether. And I'll use strict less

131
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,800
than signs, just where the function starts or stops decreasing in the middle of its domain.

132
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,560
But again, that's not important. To describe where the function is increasing,

133
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:43,680
that's for x values in between negative two and one. So I can write that as an inequality as negative

134
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:51,120
two less than x less than one. I can also describe these intervals in interval notation. So that would

135
00:15:51,120 --> 00:16:00,080
be close bracket negative four negative two open bracket, a cup sign for union, and then four comma

136
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:08,000
seven for the decreasing part and the increasing part is negative two comma one. I'm going to modify

137
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,600
my graph just a little bit now by putting arrows on the end. When I have arrows instead of

138
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:20,160
dots or just hard stops, that signifies that the function continues in the same direction forever.

139
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,800
So if I write it like that, then the place where the function is increasing is still the same,

140
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:34,320
it's still going to be from x values going from negative two to one. But now the decreasing part

141
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:41,600
of the function extends further. So this section, these x values extend all the way out to infinity

142
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,320
and it we assume that it keeps going keeps decreasing here. So I would write that as

143
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:56,400
for infinity. And similarly, the left part, I would write as negative infinity, negative two,

144
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,320
because the function is going on forever in this direction to set x values go all the way to negative

145
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,400
infinity on that chunk. So when talking about increasing and decreasing parts of functions

146
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,080
based on graphs, the thing to remember is that x is going to be heading from

147
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:23,280
left to right. As long as you do that increasing just means that y goes up. Decreasing means that

148
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:32,480
y goes down. And if you're describing the intervals, you have to do that in terms of x values.

149
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:41,200
This video is about identifying maximums and minimums for functions from their graphs.

150
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,080
We'll start with some definitions.

151
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,120
A function f of x has an absolute maximum at the x value of x equals C, if the y value

152
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:01,120
at x equals C is as big as it ever gets. We can write this more precisely by saying that

153
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:09,920
f of C, that's the y value at x equals C is bigger than or equal to f of x, that's the y value at

154
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:24,800
some other x value. For all x values in the domain of f, that biggest y value f of C is called the

155
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:33,600
absolute maximum value for f. And the point with an x value and a y value given is called an

156
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:42,480
absolute maximum point. If I have a graph of a function, then the absolute maximum value

157
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,840
f of C is the highest value that function ever achieves. And the absolute maximum point

158
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,120
is the point where it achieves that value. Now it's possible for a function to have more than one

159
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,040
absolute maximum point, if there happens to be a tie where that highest value is achieved.

160
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,560
But a function can only have at most one absolute maximum value.

161
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:16,960
A function f of x has an absolute minimum at x equals C, if the y value

162
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:27,200
at x equals C is as small as it ever gets. We can write this more precisely by saying that

163
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:36,720
f of C is less than or equal to f of x for all x values in the domain of f.

164
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:50,240
The y value f of C is called the absolute minimum value of f. And the point C f of C

165
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,320
is called an absolute minimum point. In the graph of f of x,

166
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:06,720
f of C is now the lowest y value that the graph ever achieves. And the point C f of C

167
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:13,040
is the point where it achieves this very low y value. For example, this function

168
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,720
has an absolute minimum value of about negative eight. And it has an absolute minimum point

169
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:30,480
with coordinates three negative eight. If this function stops here and has domain from x values

170
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:38,320
just from zero to four, then the function will have an absolute maximum value of 10

171
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:47,680
achieved at the point with coordinates for 10. If however, the function keeps going on forever,

172
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,360
then it will have no absolute maximum value at all.

173
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:02,080
Absolute maximum minimum values can also be called global maximum and minimum values.

174
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:13,040
A function f of x has a local maximum at x equals C. If the y value at the x value of C

175
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:20,000
is bigger than any y values nearby, it doesn't have to be the biggest y value anywhere in the domain.

176
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,600
There's bigger y values up here. It just has to be the biggest y value nearby,

177
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,320
or more precisely, in an open interval of x values around C.

178
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:39,440
We can write this by saying that f of C is bigger than or equal to f of x for all x values

179
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:53,040
in an open interval around C. The y value f of C is called a local maximum value for f,

180
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,440
and the point with coordinates C f of C is called a local maximum point.

181
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:10,720
A function f of x has a local minimum at x equals C, if f of C is less than or equal to f of x

182
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:22,240
for all x values in an open interval around C. The y value f of C is called a local minimum value,

183
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,600
and the point with coordinates C f of C is called a local minimum point.

184
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,400
A function might have many local minimum values.

185
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:48,800
In this example, assuming that the domain is from zero to four, we have a local minimum point

186
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:57,440
at x equals three, because this point here is the lowest point anywhere nearby. It also happens

187
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,160
to be an absolute minimum point. Turning our attention to local maximum points, this function

188
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:12,080
has a local maximum point at one, two, say, because this point here is the highest point

189
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,560
anywhere nearby, even though it's not the highest point anywhere in the domain since

190
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:24,480
they're highest points, higher points over here. So we have a local max point at one,

191
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:32,400
two, which is not an absolute max. Different sources use different conventions as far as

192
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,640
whether the point four, 10 up here counts as a local maximum point or not. Some sources do

193
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,840
consider it a local maximum, since it's the highest point anywhere nearby. But other sources

194
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,360
say that it doesn't count as a local maximum, for the technical reason that you can't get an

195
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,760
open interval of values around four, because the function is not defined in an open interval around

196
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,240
four, because its domain stops at four. So I'll just write this as a caution that some sources

197
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,040
do not consider

198
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:21,280
for 10 to be a local max point, because f is not defined in an open interval

199
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:34,480
around x equals four. Local maximum and minimum values can also be called relative maximum and

200
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:43,760
minimum values. Please pause the video for a moment to mark all local maximum minimum points

201
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,600
on the graph of this function, as well as all absolute maximum points.

202
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:56,480
The function has a local max point here, at the point with coordinates approximately say 2.7,

203
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:04,480
3.3. It's a local max point, because it's the highest point anywhere nearby. There's a local min

204
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,880
point right here, at the point with coordinates two, two, since this is the lowest point anywhere

205
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:17,200
nearby. If this point actually existed, it would also be a local min point, as well as an absolute

206
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,560
min point. But this drilled out circle means that point is not actually part of the graph.

207
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:31,120
So there's no local min point here, and no absolute min point. The point here, with coordinates 0,4,

208
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,960
is considered by some sources to be a local max point. But by other sources, it's not considered

209
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:44,560
a local max point, since the function is not defined in an open interval around zero.

210
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,000
Turning our attention to absolute maximum min points, while there's no absolute max point,

211
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,920
since the function keeps going up and up and up forever. There's also no absolute min point,

212
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:03,760
because the function just keeps going down and down a little by a little and never actually

213
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,840
achieves the lowest value. Now, if we're talking about local max and min values, that's just the

214
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:17,120
y values of the local max and min points. So there's a local max value at this y value of 3.3.

215
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:24,880
And there's a local min value of two, this points y value. There are no absolute max or

216
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:34,560
min values for this function. In this video, we defined absolute and local max and min

217
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,680
points and values. This video is about symmetry of graphs and functions.

218
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,000
We say that a graph is symmetric with respect to the x axis, if

219
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:59,760
the graph has mirror symmetry with the x axis as the mirror line. This graph here is an example.

220
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:09,120
Here is the mirror line. Notice that the point five, three is on this graph. And so it's mirror image

221
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:16,240
and so it's mirror image five negative three is also on the graph. Similarly, the point

222
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:24,160
two two is on the graph and its mirror image two negative two is on the graph. For any point

223
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:32,000
x y on a graph, its mirror image when you flip over the x axis will have coordinates,

224
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:39,920
the same x coordinate, and the opposite of the y coordinate. Therefore, we can say that

225
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:45,600
a graph is symmetric with respect to the x axis. If whenever a point x y is on the graph,

226
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:53,120
the point x negative y is also on the graph. We say that a graph is symmetric with respect to

227
00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:04,480
the y axis if it has mirror symmetry with the y axis as the mirror line. This graph is symmetric

228
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:12,960
with respect to the y axis. Here is the mirror line. Notice that the point with coordinates two

229
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,360
three is on this graph. It's mirror image, which is also on the graph has coordinates

230
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,120
negative two three. So the same y coordinate, but the opposite x coordinate. And in fact,

231
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:36,000
if I take any point with coordinates x y, and I want its mirror image with the y axis as a

232
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:44,560
mirror line, I'm going to get a point with the same height, the same y coordinate, but the opposite

233
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:50,160
x coordinate. So I can say that a graph is symmetric with respect to the y axis. If whenever

234
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:58,480
a point x y is on the graph, the point negative x y is also on the graph. Finally, a graph is

235
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:10,720
symmetric with respect to the origin, if it has 180 degree rotational symmetry around the origin.

236
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:21,120
This means that if I spin it by 180 degrees, the graph should line up exactly with itself.

237
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,520
Rotating a graph by 180 degrees is the same thing as turning it upside down. So one way to see if

238
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,280
a graph has symmetry respect to the origin is to turn it upside down and see if it looks exactly

239
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:39,600
the same. This one does. Playing around with points, I noticed that the point

240
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:48,320
one negative two is on this graph. If I rotate that point around the origin by 180 degrees,

241
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:57,920
I get to the point with coordinates negative one two. If I start with the point on the graph

242
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:04,000
with coordinates two three, and I rotate by 180 degrees, I get the point with coordinates

243
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:15,040
negative two negative three. And in general, if I start with a point x y, and I rotate that 180

244
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:22,960
degrees around the origin, I get the point with coordinates negative x negative y. So we can say

245
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,480
that a graph is symmetric with respect to the origin. If whenever a point x y is on the graph,

246
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:35,120
the point negative x negative y is also on the graph. Please pause the video for a moment and

247
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,560
decide which of these graphs are symmetric with respect to the x axis, the y axis, and the origin.

248
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:47,840
Some graphs may have more than one type of symmetry. Graph a is symmetric with respect to the origin.

249
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,760
Because if you rotate it by 180 degrees, that is, you turn it upside down, it looks exactly the

250
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,720
same. It does not have any mirror symmetry. So it's not symmetric with respect to the x axis or the

251
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:07,360
y axis. Graph B does have mirror symmetry. I'll draw on the two mirror lines. So it's both symmetric

252
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:14,400
with respect to the x axis, and symmetric with respect to the y axis. It also looks exactly

253
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:21,520
the same upside down. So it's also symmetric with respect to the origin. Graph C is symmetric

254
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:27,840
with respect to the y axis, but has no other symmetry. And graph D is symmetric with respect

255
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:38,400
to the x axis with no other symmetry. We use the words even and odd to describe functions whose

256
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:44,640
graphs have certain kinds of symmetry. A function is even if its graph is symmetric

257
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:52,000
with respect to the y axis. Remember that being symmetric with respect to the y axis

258
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,920
means that whenever a point x y is on the graph, its mirror image negative x y is also on the graph.

259
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:12,160
That is, the y values corresponding to x and negative x are the same. Using function notation,

260
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:20,560
I can write these points as the points with coordinates x, f of x, and negative x, f of

261
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:28,960
negative x, since the y value of her function is given by f of its x value. So we can say that a

262
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:38,080
function f of x is even if f of negative x equals f of x for all x values in its domain.

263
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:46,640
The function has the same height at x and negative x. For example, we can see that function f of x

264
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,360
equals x squared plus three is even. And one way to see this is by looking at its graph,

265
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,640
which looks pretty much like the graph I've drawn. And noticing that its graph is symmetric

266
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,720
across the y axis. But we can also check that this function is even algebraically

267
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:09,440
without knowing anything about its graph. All we have to do is check that f of negative x is equal

268
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:18,880
to f of x. So if we plug in negative x for x into this formula, that's negative x squared plus three,

269
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,600
but negative x squared is the same thing as x squared. And so this is exactly the same thing

270
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:33,040
as f of x. And the property of being even is satisfied. We say that a function f of x is odd

271
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:42,000
if its graph is symmetric with respect to the origin. Recall that a graph is symmetric with

272
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:50,160
respect to the origin means that whenever a point x y is on the graph, it's 180 degree

273
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:56,880
80 degree rotation point, negative x, negative y is also on the graph. That is,

274
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:04,080
the graphs y value at x, and the graphs y value at negative x are the opposites of each other,

275
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:11,200
same magnitude, but opposite sign. If we use function notation for the coordinates of these

276
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:19,440
points, this one is x, f of x. And this one is negative x, f of negative x, right, because

277
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:28,080
the y value for a function at the x value of negative x is just f of negative x. So for a

278
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:37,680
function to be odd, we see that f of negative x, that y value has to be the opposite of f of x,

279
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:46,800
the other guy's y value. A function f of x is odd if f of negative x is the negative of f of x

280
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:55,680
for all x in its domain. Let's look at this example, we could draw its graph and verify

281
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:01,280
the functions odd by seeing that rotational symmetry around the origin on its graph. But we

282
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,520
can also figure it out algebraically by checking to see that f of negative x is equal to negative

283
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:14,560
of f of x. So let's plug in negative x for x in the formula for f that gives us five times negative

284
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:23,360
x minus one over negative x, that simplifies to negative five x plus one over x. And we can see

285
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:30,640
that that is actually the negative of five x minus one over x by factoring out a negative sign,

286
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:41,520
which is negative f of x. So the property for being odd holds. In this video, we talked about

287
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:49,280
symmetry with respect to the x axis, symmetry with respect to the y axis, and symmetry with

288
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,280
respect to the origin. Functions that are symmetric with respect to the y axis are even

289
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:00,080
functions, and functions that are symmetric with respect to the origin are odd functions.

290
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,680
There's no word for functions that are symmetric with respect to the x axis. And that's because

291
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,160
if your graph is symmetric with respect to the x axis, it's not going to be a function.

292
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,720
This video gives the graphs of some commonly used functions that I call the toolkit functions.

293
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:23,280
The first function is the function y equals x. Let's plot a few points on the graph of this

294
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:33,440
function. If x is zero, y zero, if x is one, y is one, and so on, y is always equal to x,

295
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,960
doesn't have to just be an integer, it can be any real number. And we're connecting the dots,

296
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:46,480
we get a straight line through the origin. Let's look at the graph of y equals x squared. If x is

297
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:56,000
zero, y is zero, so we go through the origin again, if x is one, y is one. And if x is negative one,

298
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,760
y is also one. The x value of two gives a y value of four and the x value of negative two gives a

299
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:12,480
y value of four also. Connecting the dots, we get a parabola. Notice this this function

300
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:20,720
is an even function. That means it has mirror symmetry across the y axis, the left side looks

301
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:26,320
like exactly like the mirror image of the right side. That happens because when you square a

302
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:34,000
positive number like two, you get the exact same y value as when you square its mirror image x value

303
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,160
of negative two. The next function y equals x cubed, I'll call that a cubic. Let's plot a few

304
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:50,320
points when x is zero, y is zero, when x is one, y is one, when x is negative one, y is negative one,

305
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,640
two goes with the point eight way up here and an x value of negative two is going to give us

306
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,840
negative eight. If I connect the dots, I get something that looks kind of like this.

307
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:12,640
This function is what's called an odd function, because it has 180 degree rotational symmetry

308
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,840
around the origin. If I rotate this whole graph by 180 degrees, or in other words, turn the paper

309
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:24,720
upside down, I'll get exactly the same shape. The reason this function has this odd symmetry

310
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:32,560
is because when I cube a positive number and get its y value, I get and cube the corresponding

311
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,800
negative number to get its y value, the negative number cubed gives us exactly the negative of

312
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,840
the the y value we get with cubing the positive number. Let's look at the next example, y equals

313
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:54,880
a square root of x. Notice that the domain of this function is just x values bigger than or

314
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,760
equal to zero, because we can't take the square root of a negative number. Let's plug in a few

315
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:07,360
x values, x is zero gives y is zero, x is one, square root of one is one, square root of four is two.

316
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,440
And connecting the dots, I get a function that looks like this.

317
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:18,400
The absolute value function is next. Again, if we plug in a few points,

318
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:27,120
x is zero goes with y equals zero, x is one gives us one, the absolute value of negative one is one

319
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,960
to two is on the graph and the absolute value of negative two is two. I'm ending up getting

320
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,040
a v shaped graph. It also has even or mirror symmetry.

321
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,040
y equals two to the x is what's known as an exponential function. That's because the variable

322
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,720
x is in the exponent. If I plot a few points,

323
00:39:52,800 --> 00:40:06,400
two to the zero is one, two to the one is two, two squared is four, two to the minus one is one

324
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,200
half. I'll plot these on my graph. And let me fill in a few more points. So let's see,

325
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:20,320
two cubed is eight, that's way up here. And negative two gives me one fourth, one eighth.

326
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,920
Connecting the dots, I get something that's shaped like this.

327
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,640
You might have heard the expression exponential growth, when talking about, for example, population

328
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:38,000
growth. This is function is represents exponential growth, it grows very, very steeply. Every time

329
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,800
we increase the x coordinate by one, we double the y coordinate.

330
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:51,680
We could also look at a function like y equals three to the x or sometimes y equals e to the x,

331
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:59,840
where e is just a number about 2.7. These functions look very similar. It's just the bigger base

332
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:06,880
makes us rise a little more steeply. Now let's look at the function y equals one over x.

333
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:14,720
It's not defined when x is zero, but I can plug in x equals one half, one over one half is two,

334
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:24,480
one over one is one, and one over two is one half. If I connect the dots, I get this shape

335
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:29,920
in the first quadrant, but I haven't looked at negative values of x, when x is negative,

336
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,800
one over negative one is negative one, one over negative a half is negative two.

337
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:43,280
And I get a similar looking piece in the third quadrant. This is an example of a hyperbola.

338
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:53,200
And it's also an odd function, because it has that 180 degree rotational symmetry.

339
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,920
If I turn the page upside down, it'll look exactly the same.

340
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:03,520
Finally, let's look at y equals one over x squared. Again, it's not defined when x is zero,

341
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:11,600
but I can plug in points like one half or x, let's see one over one half squared is one over one

342
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:21,600
fourth, which is four. And one over one squared, one over two squared is a fourth. It's pretty much

343
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,560
like the previous function, it's just a little bit more extreme rises a little more steeply,

344
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,520
falls a little more dramatically. But for negative values of x, something a little bit different

345
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:37,840
goes on. For example, one over negative two squared is just one over four, which is a fourth.

346
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,120
So I can plot that point there. And one over negative one squared, that's just one.

347
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,480
So my curve for negative values of x is going to lie in the second quadrant,

348
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,720
not the third quadrant. This is an example of an even function.

349
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,640
Because it has perfect mirror symmetry across the y axis.

350
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,880
These are the toolkit functions. And I recommend you memorize the shape of each of them.

351
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,360
That way you can draw at least a rough sketch very quickly without having to plug in points.

352
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,040
That's all for the graphs of the toolkit functions.

353
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:25,600
If we change the equation of a function, then the graph of the function changes or transforms

354
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:31,680
in predictable ways. This video gives some rules and examples for transformations of functions.

355
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,280
To get the most out of this video, it's helpful if you're already familiar with the graph of some

356
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:43,920
typical functions, I call them toolkit functions, like y equals square root of x, y equals x squared,

357
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,480
y equals the absolute value of x and so on. If you're not familiar with those graphs,

358
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,080
I encourage you to watch my video called toolkit functions first before watching this one.

359
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,520
I want to start by reviewing function notation. If g of x represents the function the square root

360
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:09,280
of x, then we can rewrite these expressions in terms of square roots. For example, g of x minus

361
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:19,440
two is the same thing as the square root of x minus two. g of quantity x minus two means we plug

362
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:27,680
in x minus two everywhere we see an x. So that would be the same thing as the square root of

363
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,560
quantity x minus two. In the second example, I say that we're subtracting two on the inside of the

364
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,160
function because we're subtracting two before we apply the square root function. Whereas on the

365
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:45,760
first example, I say that the minus two is on the outside of the function, we're doing the square root

366
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:52,240
function first and then subtracting two. In this third example, g of three x, we're multiplying by

367
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:58,000
three on the inside of the function. To evaluate this in terms of square root, we plug in the entire

368
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:05,840
three x for x and the square root function. That gives us the square root of three x. In the next

369
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:12,000
example, we're multiplying by three on the outside of the function. This is just three times the square

370
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:20,720
root of x. Finally, g of minus x means the square root of minus x. This might look a little odd

371
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,200
because we're not used to taking the square root of a negative number. But remember that if x itself

372
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,280
is negative, like negative two, then negative x will be negative negative two or positive two. So

373
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,640
we'll really be taking the square root of a positive number in that case. Let me record which of these

374
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:42,240
are inside and which of these are outside of my function. In this next set of examples, we're using

375
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,720
the same function g of x a square root of x. But this time we're starting with an expression with

376
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:54,800
square roots in it and trying to write it in terms of g of x. So the first example, the plus 17 is

377
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,800
on the outside of my function, because I'm taking the square root of x first, and then adding 17. So

378
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:10,960
I can write this as g of x plus 17. In the second example, I'm taking x and adding 12 first, then

379
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,000
I take the square root of the whole thing. Since I'm adding the 12 to x first, that's on the inside

380
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:24,160
of my function. So I write that as g of the quantity x plus 12. Remember that this notation means

381
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:30,160
I plug in the entire x plus 12 into the square root sign, which gives me exactly square root of x

382
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:37,280
plus 12. In this next example, I'm doing the square root first and then multiply by negative 36. So my

383
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:44,400
minus 36 multiplication is outside my function. I can rewrite this as minus 36 times g of x.

384
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:51,360
Finally, in this last example, I take x multiply by a fourth and then apply the square root of x.

385
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:58,800
So that's the same thing as g of one fourth x, my one fourth x is on the inside of my function.

386
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,560
In other words, it's inside the parentheses when I use function notation.

387
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,160
Let's graph the square root of x and two transformations of this function.

388
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,200
y equals the square root of x goes through the points 0011 and 42, since the square root of

389
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:22,480
four is two, and looks something like this. In order to graph y equals the square root of x minus

390
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,080
two, notice that the minus two is on the outside of the function. That means we're going to take

391
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:34,960
the square root of x first and then subtract two. So for example, if we start with the x value of zero

392
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,640
and compute the square root of zero, that's zero, then we subtract two to give us a y value of negative

393
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:48,480
two. An x value of one, which under the square root function had a y value of one, now has a y

394
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:56,400
value that's decreased by two, one minus two is negative one. And finally, an x value of four,

395
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:02,800
which under the square root function had a y value of two, now has a y value of two minus two or zero,

396
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:10,240
its y value was also decreased by two. If I plot these new points, zero goes with negative two,

397
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:16,480
one goes with negative one, and four goes with zero, I have my transformed graph.

398
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:24,240
Because I subtracted two on the outside of my function, my y values were decreased by two,

399
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:31,440
which brought my graph down by two units. Next, let's look at y equals the square root of quantity

400
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,480
x minus two. Now we're subtracting two on the inside of our function, which means we subtract

401
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,160
two from x first and then take the square root. In order to get the same y value of zero as we

402
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:48,640
had in our blue graph, we need our x minus two to be zero. So we need our original x to be two.

403
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:53,520
In order to get the y value of one that we had in our blue graph,

404
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,120
we need to be taking the square root of one. So we need x minus two to be one,

405
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,840
which means that we need to start with an x value of three.

406
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:09,520
And in order to reproduce our y value of two from our original graph, we need the square root

407
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:15,520
of x minus two to be two, which means we need to start out by taking the square root of four,

408
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:21,040
which means our x minus two is four. So our x should be up there at six.

409
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:28,880
If I plot my x values with my corresponding y values of square root of x minus two,

410
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:36,000
I get the following graph. Notice that the graph has moved horizontally to the right by two units.

411
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:44,160
To me, moving down by two units makes sense because we're subtracting two. So we're decreasing

412
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:49,520
y's by two units. But the minus two on the inside, that kind of does the opposite of what I expect.

413
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:56,160
I might expect it to move the graph left. I might expect the x values to be going down by two units.

414
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:02,720
But instead, it moves the graph to the right because the x units have to go up by two units

415
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:07,040
in order to get the right square root when I then subtract two units again.

416
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,800
The observations we made for these transformations of functions

417
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:18,240
hold in general, according to the following rules. First of all, numbers on the outside of the function,

418
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:24,800
like in our example, y equals the square root of x minus two, those numbers affect the y values

419
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:30,560
and result in vertical motions, like we saw. These motions are in the direction you expect,

420
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:36,960
so subtracting two moves just down by two. If we were adding two instead, that would move us up by two.

421
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,000
Numbers on the inside of the function, that's like our example,

422
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,160
y equals the square root of quantity x minus two, those affect the x values and result in a

423
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:53,920
horizontal motion. These motions go in the opposite direction from what you expect. Remember,

424
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:59,360
the minus two on the inside actually shifted our graph to the right. If it had a plus two on the

425
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:06,720
inside, that would actually shift our graph to the left. Adding results in a shift, those are

426
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:13,840
called translations, but multiplying like something like y equals three times the square root of x,

427
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:20,720
that would result in a stretch or shrink. In other words, if I start with the square root of x,

428
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:26,640
and then want to graph y equals three times the square root of x, that stretches my graph

429
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:35,440
vertically by a factor of three, like this. If I want to graph y equals one third times the square

430
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:43,120
root of x, that shrinks my graph vertically by a factor of one third. Finally, a negative sign

431
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:48,800
results in reflection. For example, if I start with a graph of y equals the square root of x,

432
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:55,360
and then want to graph y equals the square root of negative x, that's going to do a reflection in

433
00:51:55,360 --> 00:52:01,040
the horizontal direction because the negative is on the inside of the square root sign. A reflection

434
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:08,160
in the horizontal direction means a reflection across the y axis. If instead, I want to graph

435
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:13,280
y equals negative the square root of x, that negative sign on the outside means a vertical

436
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:22,080
reflection, a reflection across the x axis. Pause the video for a moment and see if you

437
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:27,760
could describe what happens in these four transformations. In the first example, we're

438
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:33,440
subtracting four on the outside of the function. Adding and subtracting means a translation or

439
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,720
shift. And since we're on the outside of the function that affects the y values, that's moving

440
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:46,000
us vertically. So this transformation should take the square root of graph and move it down

441
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:54,400
by four units. That would look something like this. In the next example, we're adding 12 on the

442
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:00,960
inside. That's still a translation, but now we're moving horizontally. And so since we go the

443
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,800
opposite direction we expect, we are going to go to the left by 12 units. That's going to look

444
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:13,040
something like this. In the next example, we're multiplying by three and introducing a negative

445
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:19,120
sign, both on the outside of our function. Outside our function means we're affecting the y values.

446
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:26,080
So and multiplication means we're stretching by a factor of three, the negative sign means we reflect

447
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:32,160
in the vertical direction. Here's stretching by a factor of three vertically, before I applied

448
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:39,920
the minus sign. And now the minus sign reflects in the vertical direction. Finally, in this last

449
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:45,760
example, we're multiplying by one quarter on the inside of our function. We know that multiplication

450
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:52,320
means stretch or shrink. And since we're on the inside, it's a horizontal motion. And it does the

451
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:57,840
opposite of what we expect. So instead of shrinking by a factor of one fourth horizontally, it's

452
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:04,400
actually going to stretch by the reciprocal, a factor of four horizontally. That'll look something

453
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:10,960
like this. Notice that stretching horizontally by a factor of four looks kind of like shrinking

454
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:17,120
vertically by a factor of one half. And that's actually borne out by the algebra, because the

455
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:22,080
square root of one fourth x is the same thing as the square root of one fourth times the square root

456
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:28,080
of x, which is the same thing as one half times the square root of x. And so now we can see

457
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:34,880
algebraically, that a vertical shrink by a factor of one half is the same as a horizontal

458
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,200
stretch by a factor of four, at least for this function, the square root function.

459
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,120
This video gave some rules for transformations of functions, which I'll repeat below.

460
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:54,000
Numbers on the outside correspond to changes in the y values, or vertical motions.

461
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:01,520
Numbers on the inside of the function affect the x values and result in horizontal motions.

462
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:08,240
Adding and subtracting corresponds to translations or shifts.

463
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,680
Multiplying and dividing by numbers corresponds to stretches and shrinks.

464
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:22,880
And putting in a negative sign corresponds to a reflection, a horizontal reflection,

465
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:28,480
if the negative sign is on the inside, and a vertical reflection, if the negative sign is on

466
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:34,480
the outside. Knowing these basic rules about transformations empowers you to be able to

467
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:41,520
sketch graphs of much more complicated functions, like y equals three times the square root of x

468
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:49,680
plus two, by simply considering the transformations one at a time. This video introduces piecewise

469
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:58,080
functions. A piecewise function is a function who's defined in pieces by two or more different rules

470
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:04,480
that apply for different x values. The rule for calculating this function is you calculate

471
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,960
negative x squared, if x is less than one, but you calculate negative two x plus three, if x is

472
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:17,760
greater than or equal to one. So if we want to find f of negative two, well, negative two is less

473
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:26,160
than one. So the first rule applies. And we compute f of negative two by plugging in negative two

474
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:32,320
for x in the first rule. So that's negative four. Next, if we want to find f of one,

475
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:39,200
well, one is right on the border in between the two rules. But because we have a greater than or

476
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:46,880
equal to here, when x is equal to one, we apply this rule. And so we can plug one into the formula

477
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:52,800
negative two x plus three, so that's negative two times one plus three, which gives us one as our

478
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:59,280
output. Finally, if we want to compute f of three, since three is bigger than or equal to one,

479
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:06,960
the second rule applies, and we plug three into that rule. That gives us an answer of negative three.

480
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,520
To graph f, it makes sense to also draw the graph in pieces. First, I'm going to draw the graph of

481
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:21,280
minus x squared. Just x squared would be a parabola opening up. So minus x squared is a parabola

482
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:30,800
opening down goes through the points negative one, negative one and one negative one. So it looks

483
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:38,000
something like this. Now I've drawn the whole parabola, but the rule actually only applies

484
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,920
when x is less than one. So I'll keep the part of the parabola when x is less than one, and I'll

485
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:50,400
erase the part of the parabola when x is greater than or equal to one. I'll leave an open circle

486
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:57,040
here when x equals one, since that point is not included in this definition either. Next, I'm going

487
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:03,680
to draw the second piece, the line y equals minus two x plus three. So that's a line with slope

488
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:09,920
negative two and intercept y intercept three, so it goes through this point zero three. And then it

489
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:18,800
goes over by one and down by two. So it goes through the point one one over by one down by two.

490
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,720
And I can continue and draw this straight line.

491
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:30,800
Again, we only want part of this graph, the part where x is greater than or equal to one. So I'll

492
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:37,440
erase the part where x is less than one, this part here. This time, I'm going to leave a closed

493
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:44,320
circle where x is equal to one, since that point is included on that graph. When drawing this graph,

494
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:49,760
it's good to think about what happens when x equals one, the border point, both in the

495
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,440
second rule, where we actually include that point, and in the first rule, where we don't

496
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,760
actually include that point, but we kind of have to draw it in order anyway to draw the open circle

497
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:06,640
here. Now the last question asks us if this function is continuous. The informal definition of

498
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,080
continuity that I'm going to use is that a function is continuous if you can draw the whole

499
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:15,360
thing without picking up your pencil. In this case, we can't, because we have to pick up our

500
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:21,920
pencil to get from the jump here up to here. So this function is not continuous, it's got a

501
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:28,400
discontinuity when x is one, which is exactly the border port between the two rules. Often,

502
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,920
piecewise functions will have discontinuities, where they transition from one rule to the next.

503
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,800
However, it's possible to have a piecewise defined function that has no discontinuity,

504
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,880
if the two pieces happen to line up perfectly. For example, if we've changed the function's

505
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:50,080
definition slightly, I'll call it g of x's time to still be the negative x squared,

506
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:56,320
when x is less than one, but this time, negative two x plus one, if x is bigger than or equal to one.

507
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:05,520
Then when we graph it, the parabola piece will look the same. But the linear piece will be two

508
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:12,400
units lower than before. And so it'll actually start right here at one negative one and go down,

509
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:18,160
and our function will be continuous. That's all for this introduction to piecewise functions.

510
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:25,840
The inverse of a function undoes what the function does. So the inverse of tying your shoes

511
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:32,720
would be to untie them. And the inverse of the function that adds two to a number

512
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:40,480
would be the function that subtracts two from a number. This video introduces inverses and

513
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:47,520
their properties. Suppose f of x is the function defined by this chart. In other words, f of two

514
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:57,040
is three, f of three is five, f of four is six, and f of five is one. The inverse function for f,

515
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:05,120
written f superscript negative one x undoes what f does. Since f takes two to three,

516
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:14,160
f inverse takes three back to two. So we write this f superscript negative one of three is two.

517
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:23,280
Similarly, since f takes three to five, f inverse takes five to three.

518
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:33,440
And since f takes four to six, f inverse of six is four. And since f takes five to one,

519
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:41,040
f inverse of one is five. I'll use these numbers to fill in the chart. Notice that the chart of

520
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:47,680
values when y equals f of x and the chart of values when y equals f inverse of x are closely

521
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:55,200
related. They share the same numbers, but the x values for f of x correspond to the y values

522
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:02,480
for f inverse of x. And the y values for f of x correspond to the x values for f inverse of x.

523
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,800
That leads us to the first key fact, inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x.

524
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,680
I'm going to plot the points for y equals f of x in blue.

525
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:21,120
Next, I'll plot the points for y equals f inverse of x in red. Pause the video for a moment and see

526
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:26,320
what kind of symmetry you observe in this graph. How are the blue points related to the red points?

527
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,800
You might have noticed that the blue points and the red points are mirror images over the mirror

528
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:42,320
line, y equals x. So our second key fact is that the graph of y equals f inverse of x can be obtained

529
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:50,800
from the graph of y equals f of x by reflecting over the line y equals x. This makes sense because

530
01:02:50,800 --> 01:03:00,240
inverses reverse the roles of y and x. In the same example, let's compute f inverse of f of 2.

531
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:09,280
This open circle means composition. In other words, we're computing f inverse of f of 2. We compute

532
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:20,080
we compute this from the inside out. So that's f inverse of 3, since f of 2 is 3, and f inverse

533
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:33,280
of 3, we see as 2. Similarly, we can compute f of f inverse of 3. And that means we take f of f

534
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:43,200
inverse of 3. Since f inverse of 3 is 2, that's the same thing as computing f of 2, which is 3.

535
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:49,760
Please pause the video for a moment and compute these other compositions.

536
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:00,080
You should have found that in every case, if you take f inverse of f of a number, you get back to

537
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:05,200
the very same number you started with. And similarly, if you take f of f inverse of any number,

538
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:14,160
you get back to the same number you started with. So in general, f inverse of f of x is equal to x,

539
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:20,720
and f of f inverse of x is also equal to x. This is the mathematical way of saying that f and

540
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:28,000
inverse f inverse undo each other. Let's look at a different example. Suppose that f of x is x cubed.

541
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:33,920
Pause the video for a moment and guess what the inverse of f should be. Remember, f inverse undoes

542
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:43,280
the work that f does. You might have guessed that f inverse of x is going to be the cube root function.

543
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:52,080
Now we can check that this is true by looking at f of f inverse of x, that's f of the cube root of

544
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:58,480
of the cube root of function, which means the cube root function cubed, which gets us back to x.

545
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:05,680
Similarly, if we compute f inverse of f of x, that's the cube root of x cubed,

546
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:12,800
and we get back to x again. So the cube root function really is the inverse of the cubing

547
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:17,920
function. When we compose the two functions, we get back to the number that we started with.

548
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:25,200
It'd be nice to have a more systematic way of finding inverses of functions besides guessing

549
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:33,680
and checking. One method uses the fact that inverses reverse the roles of y and x. So if we

550
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:40,160
want to find the inverse of the function f of x equals five minus x over three x, we can write it

551
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:50,800
as y equals five minus x over three x, reverse the roles of y and x to get x equals five minus y

552
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:58,560
over three y, and then solve for y. To solve for y, let's multiply both sides by three y,

553
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:07,440
bring all terms with y's in them to the left side, and all terms without y's in them to the

554
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:22,960
right side, factor out the y and divide to isolate y. This gives us f inverse of x as five over three

555
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:31,120
x plus one. Notice that our original function f and our inverse function f inverse are both

556
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:38,240
rational functions, but they're not the reciprocals of each other. And in general, f inverse of x is

557
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:46,880
not usually equal to one over f of x. This can be confusing, because when we write two to the minus

558
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:54,960
one, that does mean one over two, but f to the minus one of x means the inverse function and not the

559
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:02,880
reciprocal. It's natural to ask if all functions have inverse functions. That is, for any function

560
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:10,480
you might encounter, is there always a function that is it is its inverse? In fact, the answer is no.

561
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,840
See if you can come up with an example of a function that does not have an inverse function.

562
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:24,560
The word function here is key. Remember, that a function is a relationship between x values and y

563
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:33,840
values, such that for each x value in the domain, there's only one corresponding y value.

564
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:44,640
One example of a function that does not have an inverse function is the function f of x equals x

565
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:54,160
squared. To see that the inverse of this function is not a function, note that for the x squared

566
01:07:54,160 --> 01:08:03,440
function, the number two, and the number negative two, both go to the number four. So if I had an

567
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:11,680
inverse, it would have to send four to both two and negative two. The inverse would not be a function.

568
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:17,280
It might be easier to understand the problem. When you look at a graph of y equals x squared.

569
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:28,160
Recall that inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x and flip the graph over the line y equals x.

570
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:35,600
But when I flip the green graph over the line y equals x, I get this red graph. This red graph

571
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,920
is not the graph of a function, because it violates the vertical line test.

572
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:46,080
The reason that violates the vertical line test is because the original green function

573
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:53,840
violates the horizontal line test and has two x values with the same y value.

574
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:01,200
In general, a function f has an inverse function, if and only if the graph of f satisfies the

575
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:06,960
horizontal line test, i.e. every horizontal line intersects the graph in at most one point.

576
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:13,120
Pause the video for a moment and see which of these four graphs satisfy the horizontal line

577
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:18,720
test. In other words, which of the four corresponding functions would have an inverse function?

578
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:28,960
You may have found that graphs a and b violate the horizontal line test. So their functions

579
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:36,000
would not have inverse functions. But graphs C and D satisfy the horizontal line test. So these

580
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:43,120
graphs represent functions that do have inverses. Functions that satisfy the horizontal line test

581
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:50,400
are sometimes called one to one functions. Equivalently, a function is one to one,

582
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:59,600
if for any two different x values, x one and x two, the y values f of x one and f of x two

583
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:08,240
are different numbers. Sometimes this is said, f is one to one, if whenever f of x one is equal

584
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:17,040
to f of x two, then x one has to equal x two. As our last example, let's try to find p inverse

585
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:24,800
of x, where p of x is the square root of x minus two drawn here. If we graph p inverse on the same

586
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:31,840
axis as p of x, we get the following graph, simply by flipping over the line y equals x.

587
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:39,440
If we try to solve the problem algebraically, we can write y equal to square root of x minus two,

588
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:47,840
reverse the roles of y and x and solve for y by squaring both sides and adding two.

589
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:54,880
Now, if we were to graph y equals x squared plus two, that would look like a parabola. It would

590
01:10:54,880 --> 01:11:02,720
look like the red graph, we've already drawn together with another arm on the left side.

591
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:08,640
But we know that our actual inverse function consists only of this right arm.

592
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:16,560
We can specify this algebraically by making the restriction that x has to be bigger than or equal

593
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:25,200
to zero. This corresponds to the fact that on the original graph for the square root of x, y was

594
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:32,320
only greater than or equal to zero. Looking more closely at the domain and range of p and p inverse,

595
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:37,600
we know that the domain of p is all values of x such that x minus two is greater than or equal to

596
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:43,600
zero, since we can't take the square root of a negative number. This corresponds to x values

597
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,880
being greater than or equal to two, or an interval notation, the interval from two to infinity.

598
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:56,880
The range of p, we can see here is greater than or equal to zero, since we can't take the square

599
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:04,720
interval from two to infinity. The range of p, we can see from the graph is all y values greater

600
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:12,960
than or equal to zero, or the interval from zero to infinity. Similarly, based on the graph,

601
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:19,600
we see the domain of p inverse is x values greater than or equal to zero, the interval from zero to

602
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:26,960
infinity, and the range of p inverse is y values greater than or equal to two, or the interval

603
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:33,360
from two to infinity. If you look closely at these domains and ranges, you'll notice that the domain of

604
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:41,840
p corresponds exactly to the range of p inverse, and the range of p corresponds to the domain of p

605
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:51,280
inverse. This makes sense, because inverse functions reverse the rules of y and x. The domain of f

606
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:58,240
inverse of x is the x values for f inverse, which corresponds to the y values, or the range of f.

607
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:05,680
The range of f inverse is the y values for f inverse, which correspond to the x values, or the

608
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:13,200
domain of f. In this video, we discussed five key properties of inverse functions.

609
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:26,000
Inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x. The graph of y equals f inverse of x is the graph

610
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:35,760
of y equals f of x reflected over the line y equals x. When we compose f with f inverse,

611
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:43,760
we get the identity function y equals x. And similarly, when we compose f inverse with f,

612
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,880
that brings x to x. In other words, f and f inverse undo each other.

613
01:13:49,280 --> 01:14:01,920
The function f of x has an inverse function, if and only if the graph of y equals f of x

614
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:15,840
satisfies the horizontal line test. And finally, the domain of f is the range of f inverse,

615
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:26,400
and the range of f is the domain of f inverse. These properties of inverse functions will be

616
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:32,080
important when we study exponential functions and their inverses logarithmic functions.

617
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,520
There are different ways of describing the size of an angle. This video explains how to convert

618
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:50,400
between them. Angles are commonly measured using either degrees or radians. If we're talking about

619
01:14:50,400 --> 01:15:02,160
degrees, then a full circle by convention is 360 degrees. A half circle then would be 180 degrees.

620
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:09,440
And if I wanted to do say a third of a circle, that would be a third of 360 degrees or 120 degrees.

621
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:16,000
If we're using radians instead, then going all the way around the circle

622
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:25,280
is called two pi radians. The two pi was chosen because that's the circumference of a circle

623
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:33,760
with radius of one. A half circle is then half of two pi radians, which is pi radians.

624
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:44,160
And if I wanted to do say a quarter of a circle, that would be a quarter of my two pi radians,

625
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:53,200
a quarter of two pi is pi over two. To convert between degrees and radians, it's handy to use

626
01:15:53,200 --> 01:16:02,240
the fact that 180 degrees corresponds to pi radians. Both of these represent half of a circle.

627
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:09,760
Let's convert negative 135 degrees to radians. Now you might be wondering, what does a negative

628
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:14,720
angle even mean? Well, by convention, if we go in the counterclockwise direction,

629
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:24,160
that's considered a positive angle. And if we go in the clockwise direction,

630
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:32,880
that's considered a negative angle. To convert negative 135 degrees to radians,

631
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:43,040
I could multiply by pi radians per 180 degrees. Notice that the degrees cancel here. And I end up

632
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:57,680
with negative 135 pi over 180 radians. That simplifies to negative three pi over four radians.

633
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:08,560
Or if I convert pi to a decimal, that's negative 2.3562 radians up to four decimal places. But

634
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:15,200
usually if the answer is a simple fraction times pi, it's better to leave it in that form rather

635
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:21,040
than convert it to a decimal. I can also go the other direction and convert radians to degrees.

636
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:29,920
Five pi over four radians. Now, again, I need to use the fact that pi radians is 180 degrees. But

637
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:36,160
if I write it like this, with radians on the top, and degrees on the bottom, then the radians won't

638
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:45,120
cancel. So that doesn't work. Instead, instead, I need to multiply by 180 degrees over pi radians,

639
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:55,440
so that I can cancel the radians that way, the radians cancel. And I get five pi times 180 over

640
01:17:55,440 --> 01:18:04,880
four pi degrees. Now the pies also cancel. And this simplifies to 225 degrees. Converting seven

641
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:12,960
radians to degrees is similar. I need to multiply by 180 degrees over pi radians. If I work out seven

642
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:22,640
times 180 over pi on my calculator, I get 401.07 degrees up to two decimal places.

643
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:30,000
Notice that my answer, a little more than 400 is more than 360 degrees. So this is more than a full

644
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:37,760
circle. That makes sense, since seven radians is more than two pi radians, since pi is itself a

645
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:44,880
little more than three. Sometimes angles are given in terms of degrees, minutes and seconds, as in

646
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:59,120
32 degrees, 17 minutes, and 25 seconds. A minute is defined as one sixtieth of a degree.

647
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:07,040
A second is defined as one sixtieth of a minute. But since a minute is itself one sixtieth of a

648
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:16,320
degree, this is one sixtieth of one sixtieth of a degree, or one over 3600 of a degree.

649
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:23,840
You can also think of this by saying that they're 60 minutes in one degree,

650
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:30,880
and they're 3600 seconds in one degree.

651
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:38,560
Let's convert this number of degrees, minutes and seconds to a decimal number of degrees.

652
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:48,080
We know that we have 32 degrees plus 17 minutes plus 25 seconds.

653
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:56,000
I'm going to copy down the 32 degrees, but I need to convert the minutes to degrees.

654
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:02,080
I know that there's 60 minutes in one degree. If I want the units to cancel, I better put the

655
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:12,000
degrees on the top. So one degree corresponds to 60 minutes. Similarly, if I want to convert

656
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:21,040
seconds to degrees, 25 seconds, I know that they're 3600 seconds in one degree. I want the degrees to

657
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:27,280
end up on the top and I want the seconds on the bottom to cancel with the 25 seconds. So I need

658
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:37,440
to write it this way. Okay, now I can write this as 32 degrees plus 17 over 60 degrees plus 25 over

659
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:46,400
3600 degrees. And because the minutes canceled, and the seconds canceled. If I add this all up on

660
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:56,240
my calculator, I get 32.2903 degrees up to four decimal places. I can also go the other direction

661
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:03,280
and convert a decimal number of degrees into degrees minutes and seconds. I'm starting out

662
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:15,840
with 247 degrees, plus a decimal number of degrees left over. If I want to convert 0.3486

663
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:23,440
degrees to minutes, well, I know that I have 60 minutes in one degree. This time I want the

664
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:30,880
minutes on the top and the degrees on the bottom, so that my degrees will cancel. So I just multiply

665
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:42,880
my decimal by 60. And I end up with 20.916 minutes. Let me copy this down. And now I'm going to take

666
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:52,800
the 0.916 minutes and convert those to seconds. So I know that they're 60 seconds in one minute.

667
01:21:53,520 --> 01:22:06,640
So canceling my units again, I just multiply by 60, which gives me 54.96 minutes. I can copy this down

668
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:16,000
as is, or I can round off my seconds and get 247 degrees, 20 minutes, and 55 seconds.

669
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:21,520
Converting between different ways of measuring angles is all about unit conversion. To convert

670
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:28,720
between radians and degrees, we use the fact that pi radians corresponds to 180 degrees.

671
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:37,040
To convert between minutes and seconds and degrees, we use the fact that 60 minutes

672
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:43,360
corresponds to one degree, and 60 seconds corresponds to one minute.

673
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:54,880
If you have a circle, a piece of the circumference is called an arc. And

674
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:04,000
a wedge of pi for that circle is called a sector. This video explains how to calculate

675
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:11,360
the length of the arc and the area of the sector in terms of the angle and the radius of the circle.

676
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:18,960
The circumference of a circle is given by the formula, the circumference equals 2 pi

677
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:27,760
times the radius. Let's use that to solve the following problem. A circular pool has a radius

678
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:36,160
of 8 meters. Find the arc length spanned by a central angle of 2.5 radians. So this angle

679
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:43,200
from the center of the circle is supposed to be 2.5 radians. I've drawn the angle as a little bit

680
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:48,960
less than half the circle because half the circle would be pi radians, which is 3.141 radians.

681
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:57,840
So I want to find the length of this arc. I know that the total circumference is going to be 2 pi

682
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:05,760
times 8 meters. But I just want a fraction of the circumference. The arc length I want

683
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:14,720
is going to be given by the fraction of the circle that the angle makes times the circumference of

684
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:22,880
the circle. The fraction of the circle that I want is given by the ratio of 2.5 radians

685
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:30,400
over the total number of radians in the circle, which is 2 pi radians. Multiply that by this

686
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:37,600
circumference, which we said was 2 pi times 8 meters. Notice that the two pies cancel.

687
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:50,560
And I'm left with just 2.5 times 8 meters, which is 10 meters. In general, the arc length that's

688
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:57,360
related to the angle it spans by considering the arc length to be the fraction of the circle

689
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:04,400
you get by taking the angle over the total angle of the circle of 2 pi times the circumference,

690
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:11,360
which is 2 pi r. Since the two pies cancel, as they did in our example, that means that arc length

691
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:21,680
is given by theta times r. Here, r is the radius of the circle. And theta is the angle. It's

692
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:28,960
important to note that theta needs to be measured in radians, not degrees for this to work. That's

693
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:35,840
because when I took this ratio, I was using 2 pi radians for the total measure of the circle. So

694
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:42,160
it's important that theta also be in radians. The area of a circle is given by the formula

695
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:50,160
pi r squared, where r is the radius. Let's use that fact to find the area of the sector of a

696
01:25:50,160 --> 01:26:00,720
circle of radius 10 meters that spans an angle of pi over six radians. We know that the total

697
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:09,920
area of the circle is given by pi times 10 meter squared, or 100 pi meter squared.

698
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:16,480
But we just want a fraction of that area to give us the area of our sector.

699
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:27,760
So we want to take the fraction of the circle that the sector makes times the area of the circle.

700
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:36,080
Well, the fraction of the circle is given by the angle of pi or six over the total angle in the

701
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:45,600
whole circle of two pi. And we'll times that by the 100 pi meter squared. That simplifies

702
01:26:46,560 --> 01:27:00,400
to 100 pi over 12 meters squared, or 25 thirds pi meters squared. As a decimal, that's 26.18

703
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:07,280
meters squared up to two decimal places. In general, if you want to find the area of a sector,

704
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:18,320
you can take the fraction of the circle that the sector spans out times the area of the circle

705
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:25,920
pi r squared. Notice that the fraction of the circle is given by the angle that the sector makes

706
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:31,120
in radians, divided by the two pi radians in the circle.

707
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:42,720
Since the pies cancel, we can simplify this formula by saying the area is given by theta

708
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:53,120
over two times r squared, where theta is the angle of the sector in radians. Again, it's

709
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:58,560
important that this angle be in radians, since that's how we're doing our fraction of our circle

710
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:06,240
comparison. As usual, r represents the radius of the circle. Notice that if you don't have your

711
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:11,680
angle in radians, if it's in degrees instead, not a big deal, because we can always convert from

712
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:19,280
degrees to radians first, before using our formula. In this video, we saw that for a sector of angle

713
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:32,320
theta given in radians, the arc length is given by the formula theta times r. And the area of the

714
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:41,360
sector is given by theta over two times r squared, where r is the radius of the circle. This video

715
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:48,400
defines linear and radial speed for a rotating circle and explains how to convert between them.

716
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:59,600
Consider a spinning wheel. The angular speed is the angle it goes through in a unit of time. I can

717
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:09,360
write that as angle per time. The units will be something like radians per second, if the angle

718
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:14,880
is measured in radians and the times measured in seconds, or I guess we could do degrees per minute,

719
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:24,880
etc. The linear speed is the speed of a point on the rim of the wheel. So that is the distance

720
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:34,880
a point on the rim of the wheel travels in a unit of time.

721
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:42,800
I can think of that as distance per time. And so it has units of something like meters per second,

722
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:52,880
for example, or it could be feet per minute, etc. Suppose we have a ferrous wheel with radius 20 meters,

723
01:29:54,880 --> 01:30:02,320
that's making one revolution every two minutes. We want to find its angular speed and the linear

724
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:10,560
speed of a point on its rim. Now the ferrous wheel is going one revolution every two minutes. So

725
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:17,920
that's one half revolution per minute. I want to I want to find the angular speed, which is the

726
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:24,480
angle it goes through in a unit of time. I've already got a unit of time in the denominator

727
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:30,080
minutes, but I've got to somehow convert revolutions to angle. So my angular speed is

728
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:38,080
one half revolutions per minute. One revolution, I'll put that on the bottom, so the units will

729
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:47,280
cancel out, one revolution is going through an angle of two pi radians. That means my angular speed

730
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:56,640
is going to be one half times two pi radians per minute, or pi radians per minute. So that's

731
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:05,920
the linear speed, the speed of a point on the rim. Well, the wheel is going pi radians per minute.

732
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:16,800
I got to somehow convert radians into distance. So I know that when I go to pi radians, so that's all

733
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:23,360
the way around the circle, I'm going all the way around the circle. So I'm going all the way around

734
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,560
the circle, I'm going all the way around the circumference and distance. So that would be

735
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:39,600
two pi times the radius or two pi times 20 meters. The two pies cancel, as do the radians. And I'm

736
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:49,440
left with 20 pi meters per minute. Let's review how we got from angular speed to linear speed in

737
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:56,560
order to get a more general formula. I'll call the angular speed, omega looks like a w, and I'll

738
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:05,120
call the linear speed V. In the previous problem, we found the linear speed V by starting with the

739
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:14,000
angular speed, omega, and multiplying it by the circumference divided by two pi. That's because

740
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:22,240
the point on the rim travels the whole circumference as it goes through an angle of two pi all the way

741
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:32,400
around the circle. So I'll write that down here, circumference over two pi. But since I know that

742
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:39,840
my circumference is given by the formula two pi r, and the two pies cancel, as they did in the

743
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:47,680
previous problem, that shows that the linear speed is the angular speed times r, where r is

744
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:57,200
the radius of the circle. In this video, we defined linear speed and radial speed, and found that

745
01:32:57,200 --> 01:33:04,480
linear speed was radial speed times the radius of the circle. This video introduces the trig

746
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:16,320
functions, sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent for right triangles.

747
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:29,040
For a right triangle, with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle theta as drawn, we define

748
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:40,000
sine of theta as the length of the opposite side over the hypotenuse. The side that's opposite to

749
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:47,280
our angle theta has measure a and the hypotenuse is this side here with measure C. So that would be

750
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:56,160
a over C for this triangle. cosine of theta is defined as the length of the adjacent side

751
01:33:56,240 --> 01:34:03,200
over the length of hypotenuse. This side here is the side adjacent to theta. Of course, the

752
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:07,360
hypotenuse is also adjacent to theta, but it's special as the hypotenuse. So we don't think of

753
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:15,760
it as the adjacent side. So that would be b over C tangent of theta is the opposite side length

754
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:24,000
over the adjacent side length. So that would be a over b. The mnemonic to remember this

755
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:37,520
is so catoa, that's sine is opposite over hypotenuse, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse,

756
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:47,600
and tangent is opposite over adjacent. In fact, there's a relationship between tangent and sine

757
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:56,720
and cosine, namely, tangent of theta is equal to sine of theta over cosine of theta. If you

758
01:34:56,720 --> 01:35:04,640
want to see why that's that's because sine of theta over cosine of theta is given by sine,

759
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:11,440
which is opposite over hypotenuse, divided by cosine, which is adjacent over hypotenuse.

760
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:17,520
If we compute these fractions by flipping and multiplying

761
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:27,680
the hypotenuse length cancels, and we just get opposite over adjacent, which is by definition

762
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:33,920
tangent of theta. There are three more trig functions that are defined in terms of sine,

763
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:41,280
cosine and tangent. First of all, they're secant of theta by definition, that's one over

764
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:48,320
cosine of theta. So it's going to be one over the adjacent over the hypotenuse, which is the

765
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:54,240
hypotenuse over the adjacent, which in this triangle is C over B.

766
01:35:55,920 --> 01:36:03,360
cosecant of theta is defined as one over sine theta. So that's one over the opposite

767
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:09,120
over the hypotenuse, which is the hypotenuse over the opposite. And for this triangle,

768
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:17,280
that's going to be C over a. Finally, cotangent of theta is defined as one over tan theta. So

769
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:24,720
that's going to be one over opposite over adjacent, flip and multiply, I get adjacent over

770
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:34,800
opposite for which in this case is B over a. So notice that the values for cotangent,

771
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:44,080
cosecant and secant are the reciprocals of the values for tangent, sine and cosine, respectively.

772
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:51,680
Let's use these definitions to find the exact values of all six trig functions for the angle

773
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:59,440
theta in this triangle. I'll start with sine of theta, that's opposite over hypotenuse.

774
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:06,640
Well, for this angle theta, the opposite side is down here and has measured to the hypotenuse

775
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:16,080
has measure five. So sine theta is two over five. cosine theta is adjacent over hypotenuse,

776
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:22,800
but I don't know the value of this side length. But fortunately, I can find it using Pythagorean

777
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:28,160
theorem. So as I have a right triangle here, I know that a squared, I'll call the this side

778
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:37,040
length a plus b squared, where b is this other leg of the triangle is equal to c squared, where c is

779
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:43,440
the hypotenuse. So here I have a squared plus two squared equals five squared, which means that a

780
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:52,160
squared plus four equals 25, a squared is 21. So a is plus or minus the square root of 21. But

781
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:56,640
since I'm talking about the length of a side of a triangle, I can just use the positive answer.

782
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:05,200
Returning to my computation of cosine theta, I can write it as adjacent, which is the square root

783
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:15,120
of 21 over hypotenuse, which is five. tangent theta is the opposite over the adjacent. So that's

784
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:25,200
going to be two over the square root of 21. To compute secant of theta, that's one over cosine

785
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:31,760
theta. So that's going to be one over square root of 21 over five, which is five over the

786
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:42,240
square root of 21, the reciprocal of my cosine value. cosecant theta is one over sine theta,

787
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:49,120
that's going to be the reciprocal of my sine, so five halves. And cotangent theta is one over

788
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:56,720
tan theta. So it's going to be the reciprocal of my tan value, square root of 21 over two. Finally,

789
01:38:56,720 --> 01:39:04,000
we'll do an application. So if we have a kite that's flying at an angle of elevation, that's the

790
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:13,200
angle from the horizontal of 75 degrees, with a kite length string of 100 meters, we want to find

791
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:23,280
out how high it is. I'll call the height y. Well, we want to relate the known quantities, this angle

792
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:29,520
and this hypotenuse, to the unknown quantity. The unknown quantity is the opposite side of our

793
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:40,240
triangle. So if we use sine of theta equals opposite over hypotenuse, then we can relate these known

794
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:47,600
amounts sine of 75 degrees to our unknown amount y, which is the opposite and our known amount of 100

795
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:56,080
meters. solving for why this gives that y is 100 meters times sine of 75 degrees, we can use a

796
01:39:56,080 --> 01:40:03,280
calculator to compute sine of 75 degrees, be sure you use degree mode, and not radiant mode,

797
01:40:04,240 --> 01:40:14,800
when you type in the 75. When I do the computation, I get a final answer of 96.59 meters up to two

798
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:20,160
decimal places. Notice that we're ignoring the height of the person in this problem.

799
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:24,560
To remember the definitions of the trig functions, you can use the mnemonic

800
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:32,960
Soca Toa, and the fact that secant is the reciprocal of cosine, cosecant the reciprocal of sine,

801
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:40,480
and cotangent the reciprocal of tangent. In this video, I'll use geometry to compute the sine and

802
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:48,960
cosine of a 30 degree angle, a 45 degree angle, and a 60 degree angle. One way to compute the

803
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:55,760
one way to compute the sine of a 45 degree angle is to use a right triangle with a 45 degree angle.

804
01:40:56,400 --> 01:41:00,560
This particular right triangle has a hypotenuse of length one.

805
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:08,560
Since all the angles of the triangle have to add up to 180 degrees, and we already have 90 degrees

806
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:16,720
and 45 degrees. The remaining angle must also be 45 degrees. So we have an isosceles triangle

807
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:23,760
with two sides the same length. I'll call that side length a. If we want sine of 45 degrees,

808
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:30,160
let's use this 45 degree angle here, then sine is opposite over hypotenuse. So if I can figure

809
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:36,320
out how long this side length is, I'll be able to compute sine of 45 degrees. Now the Pythagorean

810
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:41,200
theorem says this side length squared plus that side length squared equals the hypotenuse squared.

811
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:48,960
So we have that a squared plus a squared equals one squared. Alright, that is two a squared equals

812
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:57,360
one. So a squared is one half, and a is plus or minus the square root of one half. Since we're

813
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:01,680
talking about the lengths of sides of triangles, I can just use the positive square root.

814
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:08,080
It's customary to rewrite this as the square root of one over the square root of two,

815
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:13,520
which is one over the square root of two, and then rationalize the denominator by multiplying

816
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:18,240
the top and the bottom by the square root of two. That gives me a square root of two in the numerator,

817
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:23,680
and the square root of two squared in the denominator, which is the square root of two over

818
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:31,040
two. So these side lengths are the square root of two over two. Now I can figure out the sine

819
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:38,880
of 45 degrees by computing the opposite over the hypotenuse. That's, I'm looking at this angle,

820
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:42,240
so opposite is square root of two over two, hypotenuse is one.

821
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:53,520
So the sine of 45 degrees is the square root of two over two cosine of 45 degrees is adjacent

822
01:42:53,520 --> 01:43:00,160
over hypotenuse. That's this side length over this hypotenuse. So that's the square root of two

823
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:08,320
over two over one again. What would happen if instead of using this triangle with hypotenuse one,

824
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:15,200
we use this triangle, also a 45 45 90 triangle, but with hypotenuse five, not quite drawn to scale.

825
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:20,480
Please pause the video for a moment and repeat the computation with this triangle.

826
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:28,480
This time I'll call the side lengths B, Pythagorean theorem tells me B squared plus B squared equals

827
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:37,120
five squared. So two B squared equals 25. And B squared equals 25 over two. B is going to be

828
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:42,640
the plus or minus the square root of 25 over two. Again, I can just use the positive version.

829
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:49,680
And so B is the square root of 25 over the square root of two, which is five over the square root of

830
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:58,800
two rationalizing the denominator, I get five root two over two. Now sine of my 45 degree angle

831
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:09,040
is opposite over hypotenuse, which is five square root of two over two divided by five.

832
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:16,160
That simplifies to the square root of two over two as before. And a similar computation shows

833
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:23,840
that cosine of 45 degrees is also squared of two over two as before. This makes sense because

834
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:30,320
sine and cosine are based on ratios of sides. And since these two triangles are similar triangles,

835
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:36,960
they'll have the same ratios of sides. To find the sine and cosine of 30 degrees,

836
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:44,480
let's use this 30 60 90 right triangle with hypotenuse one. If we double the triangle

837
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:54,960
we get an angle of 30 here, so a total angle of 60 degrees here. And this angle is also 60 degrees.

838
01:44:55,600 --> 01:45:00,960
So we have a 60 60 60 triangle, that's an equilateral triangle, all side lengths are the same.

839
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:07,360
Since this side length has length one. This side length is also one.

840
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:15,440
This entire side length is one, which means the short side of our original triangle has length one

841
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:22,640
half. Going back to my original triangle, let's use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length

842
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:32,560
of its longer side x. Pythagorean theorem says x squared plus one half squared equals one squared.

843
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:40,480
So x squared plus a fourth equals one x squared is three fourths. And so x is plus or minus the

844
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:46,800
square root of three fourths, use the positive version, and get the square root of three over the

845
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:52,960
square root of four, which is the square root of three over two. Now using our original triangle

846
01:45:52,960 --> 01:46:02,560
again, let's compute the sine of this 30 degree angle here. We know that sine of 30 degrees is

847
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:09,520
opposite over hypotenuse. The opposite of this angle is one half and the hypotenuse is one.

848
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:19,200
So we get a sine of one half over one, which is one half cosine of 30 degrees is adjacent over

849
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:27,600
hypotenuse. So that's the square root of three over two divided by one. To find sine of 60 degrees

850
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:33,920
and cosine of 60 degrees, we can actually use the same green triangle and just focus on this

851
01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:40,320
upper corner angle of 60 degrees instead. So sine of 60 degrees,

852
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:48,400
opposite over hypotenuse, but this time the opposite to this angle is a square root of three over two.

853
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:58,560
Cosine of 60 degrees, adjacent over hypotenuse gives us one half.

854
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:07,120
I'll summarize the results in this table below. Notice that a 30 degree angle corresponds to

855
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:19,040
pi over six radians since 30 degrees times pi over 180 is pi over six. Similarly, 45 degrees

856
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:24,080
corresponds to pi over four radians and 60 degrees corresponds to pi over three radians.

857
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:32,560
I recommend that you memorize the three numbers one half root two over two and root three over two

858
01:47:33,200 --> 01:47:36,640
and the fact that one half and root three over two go together.

859
01:47:38,240 --> 01:47:46,560
And root two over two goes with itself. From that information, it's not hard to reconstruct

860
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:54,320
the triangles. You know that a 45 45 90 triangle is an isosceles triangle. So it must have

861
01:47:54,320 --> 01:48:00,400
the side lengths where the same number goes with itself. And a 30 60 90 triangle

862
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:08,160
has one side length smaller than the other. So the smaller side must be one half and the

863
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:14,160
larger side must be root three over two since root three is bigger than one. And so root three over

864
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:21,760
two is bigger than one half. Doing a visual check, you can easily fill in the angles,

865
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:27,760
the smaller angle must be the 30 degree angle, and the larger one must be the 60 degree one.

866
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:34,960
In this video, we computed the sine and cosine of three special angles, 30 degrees,

867
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:45,840
45 degrees, and 60 degrees. This video defines sine and cosine in terms of points on the unit

868
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:55,040
circle. A unit circle is a circle with radius one. Up to now, we define sine and cosine and tangent

869
01:48:55,040 --> 01:49:01,840
in terms of right triangles. For example, to find sine of 14 degrees in theory, you could draw a

870
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:11,680
right triangle with an angle of 14 degrees, and then calculate the sine as the length of the opposite

871
01:49:11,680 --> 01:49:20,640
side over the length of the hypotenuse. But if we use this method to try to compute sine of 120

872
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:29,920
degrees, things go horribly wrong. When we draw this 120 degree angle, and this right angle,

873
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:35,600
there's no way to complete this picture to get a right triangle. So instead, we're going to use a

874
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:43,040
unit circle, that is, a circle of radius one. The figure below illustrates how right triangles

875
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:49,120
and the unit circle are related. If you draw right triangles, with larger of hypotenuse one,

876
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:55,600
with larger and larger angles, then the top vertex sweeps out part of a unit circle.

877
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:02,320
Let's look at this relationship in more detail. In this figure, I've drawn a right triangle

878
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:09,920
inside a unit circle. The hypotenuse of the triangle is the radius of the circle, which is one.

879
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:17,200
One vertex of the right triangle is at the origin. Another vertex of the right triangle

880
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:23,600
is at the edge of the circle. I'm going to call the coordinates of that vertex a

881
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:34,560
b. Now the base of this right triangle has length a the x coordinate, and the height of the right

882
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:44,080
triangle is b the y coordinate. If I use the right triangle definition of sine and cosine of theta,

883
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:53,280
this right here is the angle theta, then cosine of theta is adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's

884
01:50:53,360 --> 01:51:04,080
a over one, or a. Notice that a also represents the x coordinate of this point on the unit circle

885
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:12,960
at angle theta from the x axis. I'll write that down. For sine of theta, if I use the right triangle

886
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:24,400
definition, that's opposite over hypotenuse. So b over one, which is just b. But b also represents

887
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:32,160
the y coordinate of this point in the on the unit circle at angle theta. For tangent theta,

888
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:38,480
if we use the right sine triangle definition, it's opposite over adjacent. So that's b over a.

889
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:44,160
I can think of that as the y coordinate of the point over the x coordinate of the point.

890
01:51:45,680 --> 01:51:50,320
Now for angles theta that can't be part of a right triangle, because they're too big,

891
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:56,960
they're bigger than 90 degrees, like now I'll call this angle here theta. I can still use this

892
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:06,480
idea of x and y coordinates to calculate sine and cosine of theta. So if I just mark this point

893
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:13,200
on the end of this line at angle theta, if I mark that to have coordinates x and y,

894
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:22,240
then cosine theta, I'm still going to define as the x coordinate of this point, sine theta as the y

895
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:29,840
coordinate, and tangent theta as the ratio of the y coordinate over the x coordinate.

896
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:37,280
When we use this unit circle definition, we always draw theta starting from the positive x axis

897
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:40,400
and going counterclockwise.

898
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:49,680
Let's use this unit circle definition to calculate sine cosine and tangent of this angle phi.

899
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:57,280
In our figure, we have a unit circle, and these numbers are supposed to represent the x and y

900
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:07,440
coordinates of this point on the unit circle at the end point of this line segment that lies at

901
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:19,600
angle phi from the positive x axis. Sine phi is equal to the y coordinate. Cosine phi is equal to

902
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:25,840
the x coordinate. And tangent of phi is given by the ratio of the two,

903
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:32,800
which works out to negative 0.3639 up to four decimal places.

904
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:40,560
This video gives a method for calculating sine cosine and tangent in terms of the unit circle.

905
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:47,840
Starting from the positive x axis, you draw the angle theta going counterclockwise.

906
01:53:50,160 --> 01:53:57,200
You look at the coordinates of the point on the unit circle where that angle ends.

907
01:53:59,200 --> 01:54:06,800
And cosine of that angle theta is the x coordinate, sine of theta is the y coordinate,

908
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:15,120
and tangent of theta is the ratio. This video gives three properties of the trig function

909
01:54:15,200 --> 01:54:18,960
sine and cosine that can be deduced from the unit circle definition.

910
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:26,320
Recall that the unit circle definition of sine and cosine for an angle theta

911
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:35,600
is that cosine theta is the x coordinate, and sine of theta is the y coordinate for the point

912
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:44,160
on the unit circle at angle theta. The first property is what I call the periodic property.

913
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:52,320
This says that the values of cosine and sine are periodic with period two pi. And what that means

914
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:58,640
is that if you take cosine of an angle plus two pi, you get the same thing as just if you took

915
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:06,320
cosine of the angle. So when we write this down, we're assuming that theta is measured in radians.

916
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:13,440
If we want to measure theta in degrees, the similar statement is that cosine of theta plus

917
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:20,640
360 degrees is equal to cosine of theta. We can make the same statements for sine,

918
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:28,480
sine of an angle plus two pi is equal to sine of the original angle here, the angle being measured

919
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:35,440
in radians. If we want to measure the angle in degrees, the statement is that sine of theta plus

920
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:43,680
360 is equal to sine of theta. We can see why this is true from the unit circle definition

921
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:52,800
of sine and cosine. This is our angle theta, then theta plus two pi, the plus two pi adds

922
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:58,160
a full turn around the unit circle to our angle. So we end up at the same place.

923
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:04,800
Theta, and theta plus two pi are just two different names for the same location on the unit circle.

924
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:10,640
And since sine and cosine give you the y and x coordinates of that point on the unit circle,

925
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:18,320
they have to have the same value. Similarly, if we consider an angle theta, and an angle theta

926
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:26,240
minus two pi, the minus two pi means we go the other direction around the unit circle, clockwise,

927
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:32,240
clockwise, we still end up in the same place. And therefore, cosine of theta minus two pi,

928
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:39,440
the x coordinate of that position is the same thing as cosine of theta, sine of theta minus two pi

929
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:45,120
is the same thing as sine of theta. The same statements hold if we add or subtract multiples

930
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:52,000
of two pi, for example, cosine of theta plus four pi is still the same thing as cosine of theta.

931
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:58,320
This time, we've just gone two turns around the unit circle and still gotten back to the same place.

932
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:07,360
So if we want to find cosine of five pi, that's the same thing as cosine of pi plus four pi,

933
01:57:07,360 --> 01:57:14,960
which is the same thing as cosine of pi. Thinking about the unit circle, pi is halfway around the

934
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:22,640
unit circle. So cosine of pi means the x coordinate of this point right here. Well, that point has

935
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:30,000
coordinates negative one zero. So cosine of pi must be negative one. If I want to take sine of

936
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:40,960
negative 420 degrees, or that sine of negative 360 degrees, minus 60 degrees, which is the same thing

937
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:49,200
which is the same thing as sine of minus 60 degrees. Thinking about the unit circle, minus 60

938
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:57,200
degrees means I start at the positive x axis and go clockwise by 60 degrees. That lands me about

939
01:57:57,200 --> 01:58:04,960
right here. And so that's one of the special angles that has an x coordinate of one half,

940
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:11,760
a y coordinate of negative root three over two. And therefore sine of negative 60 is negative

941
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:17,520
root three over two, the y coordinate. The next property I call the even odd property.

942
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:25,040
It says that cosine is an even function, which means that cosine of negative theta is the same

943
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:33,520
thing as cosine of theta. While sine is an odd function, which means that sine of negative theta

944
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:40,480
is the negative of sine of theta. To see why this is true, let's look at an angle theta.

945
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:48,080
And the angle negative theta, a negative angle means you go in the clockwise instead of counter

946
01:58:48,080 --> 01:58:55,600
clockwise direction from the positive x axis. The coordinates of this point by definition

947
01:58:55,600 --> 01:59:00,080
are cosine theta sine theta, whereas the coordinates of this point

948
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:05,360
are cosine negative theta, sine of negative theta.

949
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:15,760
But by symmetry, these two points have the exact same x coordinate. And therefore cosine of theta

950
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:22,400
must equal cosine of negative theta. While their y coordinates have the same magnitude,

951
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:25,360
but opposite signs, this one's positive and this one's negative.

952
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:31,760
Therefore, sine of negative theta is the negative of sine of theta.

953
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:36,640
Let's figure out if tan of theta is an even or odd function.

954
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:46,720
Well, we know that tan of negative theta tangent by definition is sine over cosine.

955
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:51,840
Well, we know that sine of negative theta is the negative

956
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:57,920
of sine of theta, whereas cosine of negative theta is cosine of theta.

957
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:08,320
Therefore, we're getting negative sine theta over cosine theta, which is negative tan of theta.

958
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:17,280
Since tan of negative theta is the negative of tan of theta, tan theta is an odd function.

959
02:00:17,680 --> 02:00:23,600
The last property on this video is the Pythagorean property, which says that cosine of theta squared

960
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:30,880
plus sine of theta squared is equal to one. A lot of times this property is written with the

961
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:39,920
shorthand notation, cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one. But this notation,

962
02:00:40,160 --> 02:00:48,640
cosine squared theta just means you take cosine of theta and square it. This property is called the

963
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:55,040
Pythagorean property because it comes from the Pythagorean theorem. Let me draw a right triangle

964
02:00:55,040 --> 02:01:01,760
on the unit circle. I'll call this angle theta. So the coordinates of this endpoint here are

965
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:07,440
cosine theta, sine theta. Since this is supposed to be a unit circle,

966
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:13,280
since this is supposed to be a unit circle, the hypotenuse of my right triangle has length one.

967
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:20,880
The base of my right triangle is just cosine theta, same thing as the x coordinate of this point.

968
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:28,720
And the height of my triangle is the y coordinate of the point sine theta. Now the Pythagorean

969
02:01:28,720 --> 02:01:35,280
theorem says that this side length squared plus that side length squared equals one squared.

970
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:41,200
Since one squared is the same thing as one, that gives me the Pythagorean property.

971
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:48,080
The Pythagorean property is handy for computing values of cosine given values of sine and vice

972
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:53,920
versa. In this problem, we're told that sine of t is negative two sevenths, and t is an angle that

973
02:01:53,920 --> 02:02:00,960
lies in quadrant three. When we say the angle lies in quadrant three, that means the terminal

974
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:10,240
side of the angle lies here in quadrant three. One way to find cosine of t is to use the fact that

975
02:02:10,240 --> 02:02:23,280
cosine squared t plus sine squared t is equal to one. That is cosine of t squared plus negative two

976
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:31,440
seventh squared is equal to one. I can write this as cosine of t squared plus four,

977
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:41,120
forty ninths is equal to one. And so cosine of t squared is equal to one minus four forty ninths,

978
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:48,960
which is 45, forty ninths. Taking the square root of both sides, that gives me the cosine t

979
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:57,040
is plus or minus the square root of 45 over 49. That's plus or minus the square root of 45 over

980
02:02:57,040 --> 02:03:03,440
seven. Now, since we're in the third quadrant, we know that cosine of t, which represents the x

981
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:12,000
coordinate of this point, must also be negative. Therefore, cosine of t is going to be negative

982
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:19,360
squared of 45 over seven. It's also possible to solve this problem using the Pythagorean

983
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:26,000
theorem for right triangles directly. If we look at the fact that sine of t is negative two sevenths

984
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:31,600
and ignore the negative sign for now, we can think of this information as telling us that we have a

985
02:03:31,600 --> 02:03:38,960
right triangle angle theta, whose opposite side is two, and whose hypotenuse is seven.

986
02:03:39,280 --> 02:03:45,920
If we call this side here a, then Pythagorean theorem says this a squared plus two squared

987
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:55,200
is seven squared. So a squared plus four is 49. So a squared is 45. And a is plus or minus the

988
02:03:55,200 --> 02:04:01,840
square root of 45. Since I'm worrying about a triangle, I'm going to use the positive value.

989
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:15,280
Now, cosine of t is going to be adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's going to be the square root

990
02:04:15,280 --> 02:04:23,120
of 45 over seven. Now I go back to thinking about positive and negative signs. And I noticed that

991
02:04:23,120 --> 02:04:29,920
since I'm in the third quadrant, my cosine needs to be negative. So I just stick a negative sign in

992
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:35,520
this alternative solution uses many of the same ideas as the previous solution,

993
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:41,360
and ultimately gets us the same answer. This video gives three properties of trig functions.

994
02:04:42,160 --> 02:04:48,400
The periodic property, the even odd property, and the Pythagorean property.

995
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:53,200
This video is about the graphs of sine and cosine.

996
02:04:53,360 --> 02:05:00,080
I want to graph the functions y equals cosine t and y equals sine t, where t is in radians.

997
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:07,280
I'm going to think of this being the t axis, and this being the y axis. One way to do this is to

998
02:05:07,280 --> 02:05:13,600
plot points. So I'll fill in this chart using my knowledge of special angles on the unit circle.

999
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,240
These points will be easier to graph if I convert them all to decimals.

1000
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:25,840
Now I'll plot the points for cosine and connect the dots to get a graph of y equals cosine t from t

1001
02:05:25,840 --> 02:05:33,520
equals zero to t equals two pi. To continue the graph for t values less than zero or bigger than

1002
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:39,360
two pi, I could plot more points, or I could just use the fact that the cosine values repeat.

1003
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:46,640
If I add or subtract two pi to the my angle t, I'll be at the same place on the unit circle,

1004
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:52,640
so my cosine will be exactly the same. Therefore, my values of cosine, which are represented by

1005
02:05:52,640 --> 02:06:00,400
my y values on this graph, repeat themselves. For example, when my t value is two pi plus pi

1006
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:06,560
over six about like here, it's cosine is the same as the cosine of just pi over six. So I'll

1007
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:15,120
take this dot here and repeat it over here. Similarly, the one t is like two pi plus pi over

1008
02:06:15,120 --> 02:06:20,480
four, I get the same value of cosine is when it's just pi over four. So this dot is going to repeat.

1009
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:28,000
And I can continue repeating all my dots. This one repeats over here at two pi plus say pi over

1010
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:37,920
three. And so my whole graph will repeat something like this. It also repeats on this side, something

1011
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:46,720
like this. Since subtracting two pi from my t values will also give me the same value of cosine.

1012
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:53,760
We can also plot points to get a graph for sine and extend it by repetition.

1013
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,600
And extend it by repetition.

1014
02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:04,800
Going forward, I'll usually write the function sine and cosine as y equals cosine of x and y

1015
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:13,680
equals sine of x. When I write it this way, notice that x now refers to an angle, while y refers to

1016
02:07:13,680 --> 02:07:21,200
a value of cosine or sine. That's a different meaning of x and y compared to when we're talking

1017
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:26,960
about the unit circle, where x refers to the cosine value and y refers to the sine value.

1018
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:31,360
Now let's look at some properties of the graphs of sine and cosine.

1019
02:07:32,560 --> 02:07:38,000
The first thing you might notice is that the graph of cosine and the graph of sine are super

1020
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:43,120
similar to each other. In fact, you can think of the graph of cosine as just being the graph of

1021
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:52,080
sine shifted to the left by pi over two. So we can write cosine of x as the sine function

1022
02:07:53,120 --> 02:08:02,800
of x plus pi over two, since adding pi over two on the inside moves the graph horizontally to the

1023
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:10,240
left by pi over two. Or we can think of the graph of sine as being constructed from the

1024
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:15,920
graph of cosine by shifting the cosine graph right by pi over two. That means we can write sine

1025
02:08:15,920 --> 02:08:23,920
of x as equal to cosine of x minus pi over two, since subtracting pi over two on the inside shifts

1026
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:31,440
the cosine graph to the right by pi over two. Next, let's look at domain and range. The domain

1027
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:36,800
of sine and cosine is all real numbers. I'll write that as negative infinity to infinity,

1028
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:43,680
but the range is just from negative one to one. That makes sense, because sine and cosine come

1029
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:50,160
from the unit circle. The input values for the domain come from angles. And you can use any

1030
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:54,560
number as an angle positive negative as big as you want, just by wrapping a lot of times around

1031
02:08:54,560 --> 02:09:00,880
the circle. The output values for the range that is the actual values of sine and cosine come from

1032
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:05,440
the coordinates on the unit circle. And those coordinates can't be any bigger than one or

1033
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:11,600
any smaller than negative one. So that gives us our range. As far as even and odd behavior,

1034
02:09:11,600 --> 02:09:17,040
you can tell from the graph, here's cosine, that it's symmetric with respect to the y axis. And so

1035
02:09:17,040 --> 02:09:22,320
it must be even. Whereas the graph of sine is symmetric with respect to the origin and must

1036
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:29,920
be odd. The absolute maximum values of these two functions is one and the absolute minimum value

1037
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:37,840
is negative one. We can also use the words midline amplitude and period to describe these

1038
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:46,000
two functions. The midline is the horizontal line halfway in between the maximum and minimum points.

1039
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:55,520
Here, the midline is y equals zero. The amplitude is the vertical distance between a maximum point

1040
02:09:55,520 --> 02:10:01,120
and the midline. You can also think of the amplitude as the vertical distance between a

1041
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:07,360
minimum point and the midline, or as half the vertical distance between a min point and a max

1042
02:10:07,360 --> 02:10:15,280
point. For the cosine function and sine function, the amplitude is one. A periodic function is a

1043
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:21,040
function that repeats at regular horizontal intervals. The horizontal length of the smallest

1044
02:10:21,040 --> 02:10:30,640
repeating unit is called the period. For y equals cosine of x, the period is two pi. Notice that the

1045
02:10:30,640 --> 02:10:37,280
period is the horizontal distance between successive peaks, or maximum points, or between

1046
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:47,440
successive troughs, or minimum points. Algebraically, we can write cosine of x plus two pi equals cosine

1047
02:10:47,440 --> 02:10:56,400
of x and sine of x plus two pi equals sine of x to indicate that the functions repeat themselves

1048
02:10:56,400 --> 02:11:04,640
over an interval of two pi and have a period of two pi. In this video, we graphed y equals cosine of x

1049
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:15,360
and y equals sine of x. And observe that they both have a midline at y equals zero, an amplitude

1050
02:11:16,240 --> 02:11:19,760
of one, and a period of two pi.

1051
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:28,560
Sine use of all functions are functions that are related to sine and cosine by transformations,

1052
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:34,720
like stretching and shrinking and shifting. This video is about graphing these functions.

1053
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:43,120
Let's start by graphing the function y equals three sine of two x. This function is related to

1054
02:11:43,120 --> 02:11:49,360
the function y equals sine x. So I'll graph that first. Now the three on the outside

1055
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:56,880
stretches this graph vertically by a factor of three. While the two on the inside

1056
02:11:57,600 --> 02:12:04,800
compresses it horizontally by a factor of one half. If instead I want to graph y equals three

1057
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:11,520
sine two x plus one, this plus one on the outside shifts everything up by one unit.

1058
02:12:13,280 --> 02:12:17,120
Let's compare the midline amplitude.

1059
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:25,520
And period of our original y equals sine x, our transformed y equals three sine two x and our

1060
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:32,240
further transformed y equals three sine two x plus one. The original sign has a midline

1061
02:12:33,120 --> 02:12:37,600
at y equals zero, an amplitude of one and a period of two pi.

1062
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:44,240
For the transformed function, y equals three times sine of two x, the two on the inside

1063
02:12:44,240 --> 02:12:51,440
shrinks everything horizontally by a factor of one half. So it changes the period of two pi

1064
02:12:52,080 --> 02:13:00,960
into a period of one half times two pi, which is pi. Since the two on the inside only affects x values

1065
02:13:01,120 --> 02:13:06,000
and horizontal distances, it doesn't affect the midline, which is a y value, or the amplitude,

1066
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:12,320
which is a vertical distance. But the three on the outside does affect these things. Well, in

1067
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:17,520
particular, it affects the amplitude, since everything is stretched out vertically by a

1068
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:23,840
factor of three, the amplitude of one gets stretched to an amplitude of three. Now,

1069
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:30,160
the midline doesn't actually change because multiplying a y value of zero by three is still a y

1070
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:38,560
value of zero. Now, on the third function, we've taken the second function and added one on the

1071
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:43,760
outside. So that shifts everything up by one. Therefore, instead of having a midline at y equals

1072
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:49,760
zero, we now have a midline at y equals zero. So we have a midline at y equals zero, and we

1073
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:55,440
therefore, instead of having a midline at y equals zero, we now have a midline at y equals one.

1074
02:13:56,560 --> 02:14:01,040
The amplitude doesn't change, though, it's still three, because shifting everything up by one doesn't

1075
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:07,680
affect the distance between the midline and the and the maximum point. Also, the period is still

1076
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:13,280
pi, since the period is a horizontal measure, and adding one on the outside only affects vertical

1077
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:20,800
things. Next, let's graph the function y equals three times sine of two times quantity x minus

1078
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:26,800
pi over four. This function is very closely related to the first function we graphed on the previous

1079
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:36,400
page, that was y equals three sine of two x. In fact, if we give the name f of x to that function,

1080
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:46,880
and maybe we can call g of x, this other function, then we can get g of x by taking f of x and

1081
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:57,280
plugging in x minus pi over four in prex. In other words, g of x is f of x minus pi over four.

1082
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:04,720
This relationship gives me an idea for graphing g of x the function we want to graph. We can first

1083
02:15:05,360 --> 02:15:11,520
graph f of x, we already did that on the previous page, and then we can shift its graph

1084
02:15:13,360 --> 02:15:21,440
to the right by pi over four, because that's what you do when you subtract a number on the

1085
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:29,600
inside of a function. So here's the graph of y equals three sine two x. Recall that it's just

1086
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:35,040
the graph of sine stretched vertically by a factor of three and shrunk horizontally by a factor of

1087
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:42,560
one half. Now to graph the function that I want, I'm going to shift this graph over by pi over four

1088
02:15:42,560 --> 02:15:49,760
to the right. Notice that since I had my function written in factored form, I could just read off

1089
02:15:49,840 --> 02:16:00,880
the horizontal shift. But if I had written it instead, as y equals three sine two x minus pi

1090
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:07,440
over two, which is algebraically equivalent, it would be easy to get confused and think that I

1091
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:15,600
needed to shift over by pi over two. So it's best to factor first before figuring out what the shift

1092
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:21,440
is, we're factoring out the coefficient of x. If instead we wanted to graph this function,

1093
02:16:22,080 --> 02:16:26,880
same as the one we just graphed, it's just with a minus one on the outside, that minus one would

1094
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:37,120
just bring everything down by one. Let's take a moment to look at midline amplitude and period

1095
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:45,440
for the original parent function y equals sine of x, and our final transformed function

1096
02:16:45,440 --> 02:16:51,360
y equals three sine of two times quantity x minus pi over four minus one.

1097
02:16:52,400 --> 02:16:58,640
Our original sine function has midline at y equals zero amplitude of one and period of two pi.

1098
02:16:58,880 --> 02:17:06,480
For our transformed function, the three on the outside stretches vertically, so it makes the

1099
02:17:06,480 --> 02:17:17,040
amplitude three. The minus one on the outside shifts everything down by one. So it brings the

1100
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:25,920
midline y equals zero down to y equals negative one. The two on the inside,

1101
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:34,480
shrinks everything horizontally by a factor of one half. So the period becomes one half times two

1102
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:40,560
pi, which is pi. Finally, there's a horizontal shift going on.

1103
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:52,560
Our transformed function shifts to the right by pi over four. This horizontal shift is sometimes

1104
02:17:52,560 --> 02:18:04,080
called the phase shift. The function we just analyzed was y equals three sine two x minus

1105
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:13,360
pi over four minus one, which could also be written as y equals three sine two x minus pi over two

1106
02:18:13,920 --> 02:18:21,520
minus one. This is a function of the form y equals a sine b x minus c plus D,

1107
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:28,560
where B is positive. If we have a function of this form or the similar function with cosine in it,

1108
02:18:29,440 --> 02:18:38,240
then we know that the midline is going to be at y equals D. That's because the original midline of

1109
02:18:38,240 --> 02:18:46,960
sine or cosine at y equals zero gets shifted up by D. We know that the amplitude is going to be

1110
02:18:47,760 --> 02:18:54,400
a because this a multiplied on the outside stretches everything vertically by a factor of a

1111
02:18:55,920 --> 02:19:00,000
to be a little more accurate, we should say the amplitude is the absolute value of a

1112
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:06,720
in case a is negative. If a is negative, then that amounts to a vertical reflection or reflection

1113
02:19:06,720 --> 02:19:14,800
over the x axis. We know that the period of the original sine or cosine is two pi. And we know

1114
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:22,880
that this factor of B amounts to a horizontal shrink by a factor of one over B, or I guess it

1115
02:19:22,880 --> 02:19:29,520
could be a horizontal stretch by a factor of one over B, if B is less than one. So because we're

1116
02:19:29,520 --> 02:19:37,520
starting with a period of two pi, and we're multiplying by one over B, our new period is going

1117
02:19:37,520 --> 02:19:46,880
to be two pi over B. The trickiest thing is the horizontal shift. And to get that right, I like

1118
02:19:46,880 --> 02:19:57,200
to factor out this B for my equation. So instead of writing y equals a cosine b x minus c plus D,

1119
02:19:57,280 --> 02:20:05,360
I'm going to write y equals a cosine B times quantity x minus C over B plus D. Similarly,

1120
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:11,920
if it's a sine function, I write y equals a sine B times x minus quantity C over B plus D.

1121
02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:21,120
Then I can read off the horizontal shift as C over B. And that'll be a shift to the right

1122
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:26,560
if C over B is positive and a shift to the left if C over B is negative. This might seem backwards

1123
02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:29,920
from what you're used to, but it's because we have that minus sign there. So if C over B is

1124
02:20:29,920 --> 02:20:35,440
positive, we're actually subtracting on the inside. So that shifts right, if C of B over B is negative,

1125
02:20:35,440 --> 02:20:39,120
minus a negative is actually adding something. And that's why it shifts it to the left.

1126
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:49,440
So as one final example, say I wanted to graph y equals one third cosine of one half x plus

1127
02:20:50,240 --> 02:21:02,400
three minus five, that would have a midline at y equals minus five, an amplitude of one third,

1128
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:13,520
a period of two pi divided by one half, which is four pi, and a horizontal shift.

1129
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:23,440
Hmm, better rewrite this. A horizontal shift of six units to the left.

1130
02:21:25,440 --> 02:21:29,200
The horizontal shift is sometimes called the phase shift.

1131
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:34,640
And that's all for graphs of sine and swivel functions.

1132
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:41,920
This video is about graphing the trig functions tangent, secant, cotangent and cosecant.

1133
02:21:42,160 --> 02:21:50,080
To gain an intuition for the graph of y equals tangent of x, I think it's handy to look at

1134
02:21:50,080 --> 02:21:59,680
the slope of a line at angle theta on the unit circle. The slope of this line is the rise over

1135
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:10,000
the run. But the rise is given by sine of theta. And the run is given by cosine of theta. So the

1136
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:21,440
slope is given by sine theta over cosine theta, which is simply tan of theta. So if I want to graph

1137
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:31,520
y equals tan of x, I can think of x as being the angle and y as being the slope of the line

1138
02:22:32,480 --> 02:22:45,520
at that angle. Notice that if the angle is zero, the slope is zero. But as the angle increases

1139
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:52,480
towards pi over two, the slope gets bigger and bigger heading towards infinity.

1140
02:22:52,480 --> 02:23:03,520
As the angle goes from zero towards negative pi over two, the slope is getting negative

1141
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:10,240
and heading towards negative infinity. At exactly pi over two and negative pi over two,

1142
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:16,240
we have a vertical line. And so the slope is undefined.

1143
02:23:16,240 --> 02:23:25,040
Using this information, let's graph a rough sketch of y equals tan x. Remember, we're thinking of x

1144
02:23:25,040 --> 02:23:33,760
as the angle and y as the slope, we're going to go between an angle of negative pi over two and pi over

1145
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:42,800
two. So we said that the slope was zero, when the angle is zero, and then it heads up towards

1146
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:49,120
positive infinity as we go towards the angle goes towards pi over two with an undefined value

1147
02:23:49,120 --> 02:23:55,040
at pi over two, it goes negative heading towards negative infinity as the angle heads towards

1148
02:23:55,040 --> 02:24:01,760
negative pi over two, also with an undefined value at negative pi over two. You can also verify

1149
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:07,600
that for angles slightly bigger than pi over two, we have the same line

1150
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:16,240
as for angles that are approaching negative pi over two. And therefore, this picture repeats.

1151
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:23,120
And it turns out that tangent is periodic

1152
02:24:26,160 --> 02:24:26,960
with period

1153
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:36,480
not two pi like sine and cosine, but just pi. The period of pi makes sense because if you take

1154
02:24:36,480 --> 02:24:43,600
a line and rotate it by 180 degrees, it's the same line with the same slope and therefore has the

1155
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:52,080
same value of tangent. In this graph of y equals tan x, notice that the x intercepts

1156
02:24:53,840 --> 02:25:03,520
are at values of x of the form negative two pi negative pi zero pi two pi, etc.

1157
02:25:04,400 --> 02:25:13,680
You can write that as pi times k, where k is an integer, that is a positive or negative

1158
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:22,880
whole number or zero. This makes a lot of sense because tangent of x is sine of x over cosine

1159
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:29,200
of x. And so you're going to get x intercepts. That's where y is zero, which is where the

1160
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:39,760
numerator is zero. And sine x is zero at values of the form pi to pi, and so on.

1161
02:25:41,440 --> 02:25:46,240
From the graph, you can see the vertical asymptotes are at values like negative three pi over two,

1162
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:53,920
negative pi over two, pi over two, and three pi over two. These values can be written as

1163
02:25:53,920 --> 02:26:02,880
pi over two times k, where k is an odd integer. Again, this makes sense from the definition

1164
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:09,360
of tangent since the vertical asymptotes will occur where the denominator is zero and cosine x is

1165
02:26:09,360 --> 02:26:18,000
zero at numbers like negative pi over two, pi over two, three pi over two, and so on. The domain of

1166
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:22,720
tangent is the exact case for which it's defined. So that's going to be everything except for the

1167
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:30,720
vertical asymptotes, we can write that as x such that x is not equal to pi over two times k for k

1168
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:39,120
and odd integer. The range or the y values go all the way from negative infinity to infinity.

1169
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:47,360
And the period as we mentioned previously is pi. Since the smallest repeating unit

1170
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:57,120
has a horizontal width of pi. To graph y equals secant x, I'm going to remember that secant

1171
02:26:57,680 --> 02:27:06,960
is one over cosine. So if I start with a graph of cosine, I can take the reciprocal of the y values

1172
02:27:06,960 --> 02:27:15,200
to get the graph of secant. The reciprocal of one is one, the reciprocal of zero is undefined. So

1173
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:23,520
I'm not going to have a value at pi over two, negative pi over two, three pi over two, or negative

1174
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:29,440
three pi over two. When I take the reciprocal of numbers, just less than one, I'm going to get

1175
02:27:29,440 --> 02:27:35,280
numbers just greater than one. But if I take the reciprocal of positive numbers, getting close to

1176
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:43,280
zero, I'm going to get really big positive numbers going up towards infinity. Similarly, on the other

1177
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:51,600
side. Over here, I have numbers close to zero but negative. So their reciprocals will be negative

1178
02:27:51,600 --> 02:27:58,000
numbers heading towards negative infinity. The reciprocal of negative one is negative one.

1179
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:04,640
And similarly here. So I'm getting kind of positive and negative buckets and upside down

1180
02:28:04,640 --> 02:28:14,960
buckets as the graph of my secant. Notice that secant has a period of two pi, which makes sense

1181
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:22,000
since cosine has a period of two pi. It has a range that goes from negative infinity to negative one

1182
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:28,080
inclusive. And from one to infinity, that makes sense because the range of cosine is between

1183
02:28:28,720 --> 02:28:34,960
one and negative one. And we're taking the reciprocal of those values. The domain is everything

1184
02:28:34,960 --> 02:28:39,440
except for the vertical asymptotes. Now the vertical asymptotes are where cosine is zero.

1185
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:52,960
So that is at values of the form pi over two, three pi over two, etc. That's values of the form

1186
02:28:52,960 --> 02:29:03,360
pi over two k, where k is an odd integer. So the domain is going to be x values such that x is not

1187
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:14,080
equal to pi over two k, for k, an odd integer. The x intercepts of secant, well, it doesn't have any,

1188
02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:20,160
because you can't take one over something and get the number zero for your y value.

1189
02:29:22,960 --> 02:29:33,040
We've seen the graphs of y equals tan x, and y equals secant x. This is the graph of y equals

1190
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:39,520
cotangent x. It looks similar to the graph of tangent x is just a decreasing function instead

1191
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:46,640
of an increasing one, and it has its vertical asymptotes, and its x intercepts in different places.

1192
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:57,120
Finally, this green graph is the graph of y equals cosecant x. It's related to the graph

1193
02:29:57,120 --> 02:30:05,120
of sine x since cosecant is one over sine x. And in fact, if I draw the graph of sine x in between,

1194
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:09,440
you can see how it kind of bounces off because it's the reciprocal.

1195
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:16,080
I encourage you to memorize the general shape of these graphs. You can always figure out the

1196
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:26,720
details by thinking about how they're related to the graphs of cosine of x and sine x.

1197
02:30:29,520 --> 02:30:36,640
This video is about the graphs of transformations of tangent secant cotangent cosecant. Before I

1198
02:30:36,640 --> 02:30:44,000
graph this fancy function, I'm going to graph the related parent function y equals cosecant of x.

1199
02:30:44,240 --> 02:30:54,080
Recall that cosecant of x is one over sine of x. So the graph of cosecant of x has a vertical

1200
02:30:54,080 --> 02:31:04,480
asymptotes where sine of x is zero. That puts the vertical asymptotes at pi to pi, zero, and so on.

1201
02:31:05,200 --> 02:31:13,520
Cosecant of x is one where sine is one. So here. And so it looks something like this.

1202
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:21,280
Now, when I graph my fancy function, I know that the two on the outside does a vertical stretch

1203
02:31:21,680 --> 02:31:35,280
by two, the plus one shifts up by one. The pi means everything shrinks horizontally

1204
02:31:37,120 --> 02:31:44,080
by one over pi. And so the period, instead of being two pi, like it is for cosecant,

1205
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:52,880
it's going to be two pi divided by pi, which is two. Finally, this pi over two has to do with a

1206
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:59,280
horizontal shift. But in order to see by how much we horizontal shift, we need to factor out the pi

1207
02:31:59,280 --> 02:32:09,360
first. So if I rewrite my function as two times cosecant pi times x plus a half plus one, I can

1208
02:32:09,360 --> 02:32:16,400
see that the horizontal shift is one half to the left. Let me do those transformations in pieces.

1209
02:32:16,400 --> 02:32:23,280
First, I'll do the vertical motions. So I'll leave the horizontal axis as is. I'll stretch by a factor

1210
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:31,680
of two. And now I'll shift up by one. Next, I'll worry about the horizontal motion. Instead of a

1211
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:38,640
period of two pi, I'm going to have a period of two. But in addition, everything is going to be

1212
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:47,120
shifted left by one half. So instead of having my vertical asymptotes at zero pi, two pi, and so on,

1213
02:32:47,120 --> 02:33:00,800
they would be at zero, one, two, and so on, except everything's shifted over by one half. So that

1214
02:33:00,800 --> 02:33:11,200
means the vertical asymptotes will actually be at negative a half, a half, one and a half, and so

1215
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:21,920
on. Another way to find the vertical asymptotes is by noting that cosecant is one over a sign. So

1216
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:37,760
therefore, cosecant pi x plus one half does not exist when sine pi x plus one half equals zero,

1217
02:33:38,480 --> 02:33:51,120
i.e. when pi times x plus one half is equal to a multiple of pi. Canceling the pies and solving

1218
02:33:51,120 --> 02:34:02,640
for x, that's when x is some number minus a half. So those are exactly the values of say one half,

1219
02:34:02,640 --> 02:34:08,320
three halves, five halves, and so on that we've drawn. So once we've got the vertical asymptotes in

1220
02:34:08,320 --> 02:34:17,120
place, we can see that our graph fits in between them. This purple piece got shrunk horizontally

1221
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:23,200
and shifted by a half. So it ends up hugging the x axis. I'll draw it in right here.

1222
02:34:25,120 --> 02:34:31,680
And all the other pieces also get shrunk horizontally and shifted. So my final graph

1223
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:40,560
looks something like this. In this next problem, we're given the graph and we need to find the

1224
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:47,440
equation. The shape of the graph and the fact that it's increasing tells us it must be a tangent

1225
02:34:47,440 --> 02:34:59,120
graph. But y equals tan x by itself would have a period of pi. Let's check what our graph has a

1226
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:06,640
period of. We need to find the horizontal width of one complete cycle. It's probably easiest to

1227
02:35:06,640 --> 02:35:13,680
measure if I sketch in the vertical asymptotes, which seem to run from an x value of negative three

1228
02:35:13,680 --> 02:35:21,120
to an x value of one. So that's a horizontal distance of four. So our graph might be something

1229
02:35:21,120 --> 02:35:35,440
more like tan of b x, where pi over b has to be four. That means that pi equals four b. And so b is

1230
02:35:35,440 --> 02:35:42,880
pi over four. So our graph is probably more closely related to y equals tan of pi over four x.

1231
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:52,320
But if it were exactly y equals tan of pi over four x, then that middle point right here would be at

1232
02:35:52,320 --> 02:36:00,720
the origin. And instead, that middle point is at negative one one. That means my tangent graph is

1233
02:36:00,880 --> 02:36:12,480
is shifted left by one and up by one. The left by one I can accomplish by writing x plus one,

1234
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:20,080
when I have the pi over four factored out the up by one, I get by writing a plus one on the outside.

1235
02:36:21,280 --> 02:36:27,360
Now, it's possible there might also be a vertical stretch factor out front. An easy way to check for

1236
02:36:27,360 --> 02:36:33,920
that is by plugging in x equals zero, and seeing whether what kind of number out in front I might

1237
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:43,040
need to get this y intercept of two. So I'm going to write y equals a tan pi over four quantity x plus

1238
02:36:43,040 --> 02:36:56,720
one plus one, plug in the point zero two. So that's two equals a tan pi over four zero plus one plus

1239
02:36:56,720 --> 02:37:08,160
one. And I can solve for a since tan of pi over four is just one, this equation simplifies to two

1240
02:37:08,160 --> 02:37:16,320
equals a times one plus one, which means that a has to be one. So in fact, this equation here is our

1241
02:37:16,320 --> 02:37:25,040
final answer for this graph. To summarize, if we have a function of the form y equals a tan bx minus

1242
02:37:25,040 --> 02:37:37,680
c plus D, the number a accomplishes a vertical stretch. The number B changes the period

1243
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:55,920
from pi to pi over B, the number D shifts vertically by D. And finally, to figure out what the number C

1244
02:37:55,920 --> 02:38:05,600
is, we have to rewrite our equation in factored form factoring out the B. And so we see that there's

1245
02:38:06,320 --> 02:38:18,400
a phase shift right by C over B. The same things hold if instead of tangent, we have a graph of

1246
02:38:18,400 --> 02:38:26,400
cotangent. We can say the same things for a graph of secant and a graph of cosecant. The only thing

1247
02:38:26,400 --> 02:38:39,200
to be careful of is that B now changes the period from two pi to two pi over B, simply because the

1248
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:53,440
original period of secant and cosecant is two pi, whereas the original period of tan and cotan is just

1249
02:38:53,440 --> 02:39:01,040
pi. If you know what the original graphs of tan secant cotangent and cosecant look like, you can

1250
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:08,800
use your knowledge of transformations to graph more complicated functions. This video defines the

1251
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:19,760
standard inverse trig functions, sine inverse, cosine inverse, and tan inverse. In this crazy

1252
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:25,440
looking graph, please focus first on the thin black line. This is a graph of y equals sine x.

1253
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:32,240
The graph of the inverse of a function can be found by flipping the graph of the original function

1254
02:39:32,240 --> 02:39:38,320
over the line y equals x. I've drawn the flipped graph with this blue dotted line.

1255
02:39:39,760 --> 02:39:44,400
But you'll notice that the blue dotted line is not the graph of a function because it violates the

1256
02:39:44,480 --> 02:39:52,080
vertical line test. So in order to get a function that's the inverse of y equals sine x, we need to

1257
02:39:52,080 --> 02:39:59,840
restrict the domain of sine of x. We'll restrict it to this piece that's drawn with a thick black line.

1258
02:40:00,480 --> 02:40:06,160
If I invert that piece by flipping it over the line y equals x, I get the piece drawn

1259
02:40:06,160 --> 02:40:12,240
with a red dotted line here. And that piece does satisfy the vertical line test. So it is in fact

1260
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:19,920
a function. Although regular sine x has domain from negative infinity to infinity, our restricted

1261
02:40:19,920 --> 02:40:30,480
sine x has domain from negative pi over two to pi over two. It's, it's range is still from negative

1262
02:40:30,480 --> 02:40:36,240
one to one, just like the regular sine x, because I've taken the biggest possible piece

1263
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:43,040
of the graph, whose flipped version is still a function. The inverse sine function

1264
02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:52,320
is often written as arc sine of x. And since inverting a function reverses the roles of y and x,

1265
02:40:52,880 --> 02:41:00,320
it reverses the domain and the range. So arc sine of x, the inverse function has domain

1266
02:41:00,320 --> 02:41:05,120
from negative one to one and range from negative pi over two to pi over two,

1267
02:41:06,320 --> 02:41:12,720
which seems plausible from the graph. Now an inverse function undoes the work of a function.

1268
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:19,200
So if the function sine takes angles theta to numbers x,

1269
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:28,640
then the inverse sine or arc sine takes numbers x to angles theta.

1270
02:41:31,280 --> 02:41:38,640
For example, since sine of pi over two is one arc sine of one is pi over two.

1271
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:47,520
And in general, the output of arc sine of x is the angle between negative pi over two and pi over

1272
02:41:47,520 --> 02:41:59,120
two, whose sine is x. y is equal to arc sine x means that x is equal to sine of y. But since

1273
02:41:59,120 --> 02:42:05,040
there are many angles y whose sine is x, right, they all differ by multiples of two pi, we specify

1274
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:13,120
also that y is between negative pi over two and pi over two. That was the whole point of doing this

1275
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:20,400
domain restriction in order to get a well defined inverse value. There's an alternate notation

1276
02:42:20,400 --> 02:42:24,800
for inverse sine. Sometimes it's written as sine to the negative one of x.

1277
02:42:25,200 --> 02:42:35,280
But this notation can be confusing. So be careful. In particular, sine to the negative one of x

1278
02:42:35,280 --> 02:42:43,760
does not equal one over sine of x. One over sine of x, the reciprocal function is another word for

1279
02:42:43,760 --> 02:42:52,160
cosecant of x. But sine to the negative one of x is another word for arc sine of x, the inverse

1280
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:55,920
which is not the same thing as the reciprocal function.

1281
02:42:58,960 --> 02:43:02,240
Let's go through the same process to build an inverse cosine function.

1282
02:43:02,960 --> 02:43:10,400
We start with a graph of cosine of x. We flip it over the line y equals x to get the blue dotted

1283
02:43:10,400 --> 02:43:16,160
line. But the blue dotted line is not a function. So we go back and restrict the domain for our

1284
02:43:16,160 --> 02:43:24,800
original cosine of x to just be between zero and pi. The resulting red graph now satisfies the

1285
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:30,960
vertical line test. So it's a proper inverse function. Our restricted cosine has domain from

1286
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:40,880
zero to pi and range from negative one to one. And so our inverse function arc cosine has domain

1287
02:43:40,880 --> 02:43:49,600
from negative one to one and range from zero to pi. Since cosine takes us from angles to numbers,

1288
02:43:51,040 --> 02:44:00,240
arc cosine takes us from numbers back to angles. For example, cosine of pi over four is a square

1289
02:44:00,560 --> 02:44:07,520
root of two over two. So arc cosine of the square root of two over two is equal to pi over four.

1290
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:17,680
Arc cosine of x is the angle between zero and pi whose cosine is x.

1291
02:44:19,520 --> 02:44:26,160
In other words, y equals arc cosine of x means that x is equal to cosine of y.

1292
02:44:26,880 --> 02:44:34,720
And y is between zero and pi. Since otherwise there'd be lots of possible answers for an angle y

1293
02:44:34,720 --> 02:44:41,200
whose cosine is x. The alternative notation for arc cosine is cosine inverse.

1294
02:44:43,040 --> 02:44:50,000
And again, we have to be careful. Cosine to the negative one x is not the same thing

1295
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:55,520
as one over cosine of x. One over cosine of x is also called secant of x.

1296
02:44:56,800 --> 02:45:03,920
Cosine to the negative one x means arc cosine, the inverse function, and these two things are not the

1297
02:45:03,920 --> 02:45:13,920
same. Finally, let's take a look at inverse tangent function. Here's a graph of tangent

1298
02:45:14,640 --> 02:45:19,920
in black, these vertical lines aren't really part of the function, they're just vertical asymptotes.

1299
02:45:20,880 --> 02:45:26,640
So in order to get an actual function, when we flip over the line y equals x,

1300
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:32,960
we take just one piece of the tangent function. Here we've taken the piece marked in black.

1301
02:45:33,920 --> 02:45:40,800
When we flip that over the line y equals x, we get this piece in red, which is actually a function

1302
02:45:40,800 --> 02:45:47,280
because it satisfies the vertical line test. Now you might ask, would it be possible to pick

1303
02:45:47,280 --> 02:45:54,240
a different piece of the tangent function to invert? And the answer is yes, we could do that.

1304
02:45:54,240 --> 02:46:00,000
And on another planet, maybe mathematicians do that. But on our planet, we use the convention

1305
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:07,280
that we pick this piece of tangent to invert, which is kind of a convenient choice since it's

1306
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:14,160
centered here around the origin. In the previous two examples, our choice of restricted domain for

1307
02:46:14,160 --> 02:46:19,680
sine and per cosine was also a convention that led to a conveniently defined inverse function.

1308
02:46:21,360 --> 02:46:28,240
In any case, based on our choice, our restricted tan function has domain from negative pi over two

1309
02:46:28,880 --> 02:46:34,960
to pi over two. We don't include the endpoints in that interval, because our restricted tan

1310
02:46:34,960 --> 02:46:40,640
function has vertical asymptotes at negative pi over two, pi over two, so it's not defined there.

1311
02:46:42,320 --> 02:46:47,520
The range of our restricted tan function is from negative infinity to infinity.

1312
02:46:49,280 --> 02:46:56,640
Therefore, arc tan of x has domain from negative infinity to infinity and range

1313
02:46:56,640 --> 02:47:04,400
from negative pi over two to pi over two. Once again, tangent is taking us from angles

1314
02:47:04,400 --> 02:47:14,560
to numbers. So arc tan is taking us from numbers to angles. For example, tangent of pi over four

1315
02:47:15,200 --> 02:47:27,840
is one. And therefore arc tan of one is pi over four. So arc tan of x means the angle between

1316
02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:38,960
negative pi over two and pi over two, whose tangent is x. y is equal to arc tan x means that x is

1317
02:47:38,960 --> 02:47:48,080
equal to tangent of y. And that y is between negative pi over two and pi over two.

1318
02:47:50,800 --> 02:47:58,560
The inverse tan function can also be written as tan to the minus one of x. And once again,

1319
02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:13,600
tan inverse of x means the inverse trig function arc tan of x. And it's not equal to one over

1320
02:48:13,600 --> 02:48:17,440
tan of x, which is called cotangent of x.

1321
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:25,680
And that's all for this video on the three basic inverse trig functions.

1322
02:48:26,560 --> 02:48:34,960
Sin inverse x, also known as arc sine of x, cosine inverse x, also known as arc cosine x and tan

1323
02:48:34,960 --> 02:48:43,200
inverse x, also known as arc tan x. This video is an introduction to solving trig equations.

1324
02:48:44,640 --> 02:48:50,560
Let's start with the equation to cosine x plus one equals zero. I want to find all the solutions

1325
02:48:50,560 --> 02:48:56,480
in the interval from zero to two pi, and then get a general formula for all solutions, not just

1326
02:48:56,480 --> 02:49:04,000
those in that interval. Let me start by rewriting this equation to isolate the tricky part, which is

1327
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:13,040
cosine of x. So I'm going to write two cosine x equals negative one, and then divide both sides

1328
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:21,760
by two. Now I'm looking for the angles x between zero and two pi, whose cosine is negative one half.

1329
02:49:23,840 --> 02:49:27,520
Since negative one half is one of the special values on the unit circle,

1330
02:49:29,280 --> 02:49:35,760
I can use my knowledge of the unit circle to see that the angle between zero and two pi

1331
02:49:36,480 --> 02:49:46,160
must be either two pi over three, or four pi over three. My answer needs to include both of these

1332
02:49:46,160 --> 02:49:52,960
values. There are no other spots on the unit circle whose cosine is negative one half. But there are

1333
02:49:52,960 --> 02:49:58,720
more angles, because we can always take one of these angles and add multiples of two pi to it.

1334
02:49:59,280 --> 02:50:04,160
So if I want to find all solutions, I can take these two principle solutions,

1335
02:50:04,960 --> 02:50:11,200
two pi over three, and four pi over three, and simply add multiples of two pi to them.

1336
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:20,000
For example, two pi over three plus two pi or two pi over three minus two pi, two pi over three plus

1337
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:29,760
four pi, and so on. A much more efficient way to write this is to write two pi over three plus

1338
02:50:30,480 --> 02:50:40,320
two pi times K, for K, any integer, that is any positive or negative whole number or zero.

1339
02:50:41,280 --> 02:50:45,680
Similarly, I can write four pi over three plus two pi K

1340
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:52,480
to capture all solutions based on the principle solution four pi over three by adding and

1341
02:50:52,480 --> 02:50:56,960
subtracting multiples of two pi. This is my final solution.

1342
02:51:00,560 --> 02:51:06,720
Next, let's look at a Triggy equation involving tangent. As usual, I'm going to start out by

1343
02:51:06,720 --> 02:51:10,560
cleaning things up and isolating the tricky part, which in this case is tangent.

1344
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:22,000
So let me add tangent to both sides. That'll give me three tan x equals the square root of three.

1345
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:28,880
And so tan x is the square root of three over three. The square root of three over three looks

1346
02:51:28,880 --> 02:51:34,480
suspiciously similar to value the value of square root of three over two, which is a special value

1347
02:51:34,480 --> 02:51:41,120
on my unit circle. So my suspicion is that my unit circle will again help me find this value of x

1348
02:51:41,120 --> 02:51:52,320
without a calculator. Recall that tan x is sine x over cosine x. So I'm looking for angles on the

1349
02:51:52,320 --> 02:51:57,440
unit circle between zero and two pi, where the ratio of sine over cosine will give me

1350
02:51:58,240 --> 02:52:05,040
square root of three over three. I actually only need to look in the first quadrant and the third

1351
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:10,960
quadrant, because those are the quadrants where tangent is positive. And I really only need to

1352
02:52:10,960 --> 02:52:19,280
look at angles whose either sine or cosine has a square root of three in it. So by trial and error,

1353
02:52:19,280 --> 02:52:30,720
I can see that tan pi over six, which is sine pi over six over cosine pi over six,

1354
02:52:31,600 --> 02:52:38,880
will give me one half over root three over two. That's the same thing as one half times two over

1355
02:52:38,880 --> 02:52:45,760
root three, which is one over root three. If I rationalize that, I get root three over three.

1356
02:52:45,760 --> 02:52:52,720
So that value works. If I try tan of pi over three instead,

1357
02:52:54,400 --> 02:53:00,560
I get root three, which is not equal to root three over three. So pi over three doesn't work.

1358
02:53:01,360 --> 02:53:10,080
Similarly, I can work out some the values in the third quadrant, and see that seven pi over six

1359
02:53:10,080 --> 02:53:19,280
works. But four pi over three does not. So my answer to part a includes just the two values,

1360
02:53:20,400 --> 02:53:29,440
pi over six, and seven pi over six. Now, if I want to find all solutions, not just those

1361
02:53:29,440 --> 02:53:34,880
in the interval from zero to two pi, I noticed that I can take one of these principal solutions,

1362
02:53:35,440 --> 02:53:39,440
and add multiples of two pi to it, because that'll give me the same angle.

1363
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:52,320
So I get pi over six plus two pi k, and pi over six, sorry, seven pi over six plus two pi k for

1364
02:53:53,440 --> 02:54:01,280
k, any integer. This is a correct answer, but it's not as simple as it could be.

1365
02:54:02,240 --> 02:54:09,440
Notice that seven pi over six over here on the unit circle is exactly pi more than pi over six.

1366
02:54:09,440 --> 02:54:14,000
So instead of taking both of these and adding multiples of two pi to them,

1367
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:19,280
I could get all the same answers by just taking one of them and adding multiples of pi to it.

1368
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:28,320
So a more efficient answer is to say that x equals pi over six plus pi times k

1369
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:36,960
for k, any integer. This will still capture all the same solutions, because when k is even,

1370
02:54:37,600 --> 02:54:43,680
I'll get this family of solutions. And when k is odd, I'll get this family. For example, when k is one,

1371
02:54:45,200 --> 02:54:49,840
pi over six plus one times pi is just the original seven pi over six.

1372
02:54:51,360 --> 02:54:57,360
If you think about the fact that tangent has a period of pi, instead of two pi, it makes a lot

1373
02:54:57,360 --> 02:55:03,920
of sense that you should be able to write the solutions in this form. In this video,

1374
02:55:03,920 --> 02:55:13,360
we solved basic trig equations by first isolating sine or tangent, or the same thing would work

1375
02:55:13,360 --> 02:55:22,080
with cosine, and then using the unit circle to find principal solutions.

1376
02:55:23,040 --> 02:55:28,640
Principal solutions are just solutions between zero and two pi.

1377
02:55:30,480 --> 02:55:40,160
And then adding multiples of two pi to these principal solutions to get all solutions.

1378
02:55:41,520 --> 02:55:45,840
For tangent, we notice that it was equivalent to just use one principal solution

1379
02:55:45,840 --> 02:55:53,840
and add multiples of pi instead of two pi. In a previous video, we looked at trig equations

1380
02:55:53,840 --> 02:55:59,520
that could be solved using the unit circle. In this video, we'll solve trig equations that

1381
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:04,720
don't involve special values on the unit circle, and require a calculator instead to solve.

1382
02:56:06,480 --> 02:56:10,800
Let's look at the equation to cosine t equals one minus cosine t.

1383
02:56:11,040 --> 02:56:17,280
As usual, I'll start by simplifying and isolating cosine. Adding cosine to both sides, I get three

1384
02:56:17,280 --> 02:56:26,160
cosine t equals one, dividing by three gives cosine t equals one third. Now, one third is not one of

1385
02:56:26,160 --> 02:56:34,640
my special values on the unit circle. But I can locate it approximately, cosine represents the x

1386
02:56:34,640 --> 02:56:39,920
value of a point on the unit circle. So I'm looking for a point on the universe circle whose x

1387
02:56:40,880 --> 02:56:48,160
coordinate is approximately one third. So maybe right here, and the symmetric angle right here,

1388
02:56:48,160 --> 02:56:54,000
those are angles in the first and fourth quadrants. To get a decimal approximation

1389
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:58,560
for one of these angles, I can take our cosine of both sides of my equation.

1390
02:57:00,240 --> 02:57:07,680
This gives me t equals our cosine of one third, which using my calculator on radian mode,

1391
02:57:07,760 --> 02:57:15,920
I get a decimal approximation of 1.2310 up to four decimal places. It's important to use

1392
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:23,920
radian mode here. Since by convention, the answers to trig equations are expected to be in radians

1393
02:57:23,920 --> 02:57:31,280
unless otherwise specified. It's also important to notice that these two equations are not precisely

1394
02:57:31,280 --> 02:57:37,920
the same thing. Since cosine t equals one third has infinitely many solutions.

1395
02:57:39,360 --> 02:57:43,760
If we don't restrict to a certain interval, and even if we restrict to the interval zero to two

1396
02:57:43,760 --> 02:57:51,680
pi, it still has two different solutions. On the other hand, our t equals our cosine of one third

1397
02:57:52,320 --> 02:58:01,520
has only one solution. And that solution lies between the angles of zero and pi.

1398
02:58:02,880 --> 02:58:09,600
So this angle here, the 1.2310 radians must be giving us this angle, since it's got to be an

1399
02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:16,560
angle between zero and pi. And to get the other angle, this one, we can use the symmetry of the

1400
02:58:16,560 --> 02:58:24,320
situation. This angle and this angle are the same size. So to get all the way around to here,

1401
02:58:24,320 --> 02:58:33,280
we can go all the way to pi minus our 1.2310 radians. Using our calculator again, we can compute

1402
02:58:33,280 --> 02:58:45,280
that two pi minus 1.2310 radians is equal to 5.0522 radians. So our two solutions on our interval

1403
02:58:45,280 --> 02:58:57,600
from zero to two pi are given by 1.2310 and 5.0522 radians. Let me emphasize that we found the

1404
02:58:57,600 --> 02:59:08,560
second solution by taking two pi minus the first solution. Now it's straightforward to find all

1405
02:59:08,560 --> 02:59:15,280
solutions. We can just take our two principal solutions and add multiples of two pi.

1406
02:59:17,520 --> 02:59:20,320
It could be helpful to look at this solution graphically.

1407
02:59:21,360 --> 02:59:28,160
To solve our equation cosine t equals one third, we want to know where this graph

1408
02:59:29,440 --> 02:59:36,000
of y equals cosine of t intersects the horizontal line at y equals one third.

1409
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:44,640
This intersection point here corresponds to our first solution of 1.2310 radians.

1410
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:52,480
This intersection point here corresponds to our second solution. Notice that it occurs at a t

1411
02:59:52,480 --> 03:00:01,920
value that's two pi minus this t value here. And all the other intersection points correspond to

1412
03:00:01,920 --> 03:00:10,160
those first two intersection points shifted over by multiples of two pi. Next, let's look at the

1413
03:00:10,160 --> 03:00:20,320
equation for sine x minus one equals two. I'll start by rewriting this as four sine x equals three,

1414
03:00:20,320 --> 03:00:27,040
which is equivalent to sine x equals three fourths. Although three fourths is not a special value on

1415
03:00:27,040 --> 03:00:32,320
the unit circle, we can still use the unit circle to get oriented and see how many solutions

1416
03:00:32,320 --> 03:00:38,320
there should be in the interval from zero to two pi. Since sine represents the y coordinate of a

1417
03:00:38,320 --> 03:00:42,720
point on the unit circle, we're looking for points on the unit circle whose y coordinate is three

1418
03:00:42,720 --> 03:00:48,240
fourths. So that might be three fourths might be about here. So that would be an angle about right

1419
03:00:48,240 --> 03:00:57,680
here, and about right here. So in the first and second quadrants. Let's take the arc sine of both

1420
03:00:57,680 --> 03:01:06,400
sides to find one of those angles. I'm getting one of the angles to be arc sine of three fourths,

1421
03:01:06,400 --> 03:01:16,560
which my calculator says is 0.8481 radians. That must be this angle here. To get the other angle,

1422
03:01:16,560 --> 03:01:26,560
I can use symmetry. Since this angle here, you can get by going a full pi minus my previous angle.

1423
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:36,160
Pi minus 0.8481 is equal to 2.2935. So that's my second angle.

1424
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:45,040
Notice that this time, to get the second angle, we use pi minus the first angle.

1425
03:01:45,200 --> 03:01:51,440
Not to pi minus the first angle, like we did for cosine. Once again, we can find all solutions

1426
03:01:51,440 --> 03:01:58,960
simply by adding multiples of two pi. We can also locate these solutions on a graph of sine.

1427
03:01:59,920 --> 03:02:08,000
We're looking for where the graph of y equals sine of x intersects with the horizontal line at y

1428
03:02:08,800 --> 03:02:14,320
equals three fourths. And we can see that we have these two solutions.

1429
03:02:17,520 --> 03:02:24,880
Where the second one, its x value is pi minus the x value of this one. And then we have all these

1430
03:02:24,880 --> 03:02:31,520
additional solutions that we can get by shifting over by positive and negative multiples of two

1431
03:02:31,520 --> 03:02:37,760
pi from the first two. Finally, let's solve the equation tan x equals four.

1432
03:02:39,280 --> 03:02:43,280
If we simply take x to be tan inverse of four,

1433
03:02:45,120 --> 03:02:50,800
which is 1.3258 radians, we'll get a single solution.

1434
03:02:52,800 --> 03:02:59,680
But thinking about the graph of tangent and intersecting that graph with the horizontal

1435
03:02:59,680 --> 03:03:09,760
line y equals four, we see that there should actually be two solutions in the interval from zero

1436
03:03:09,760 --> 03:03:16,240
to two pi. This makes sense because the period of tangent is pi.

1437
03:03:18,240 --> 03:03:26,000
So any one solution will get repeated by intervals of pi. It also makes sense by thinking about the

1438
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:34,880
unit circle tangent, which can be thought of as the slope of a line at angle theta takes on all

1439
03:03:34,880 --> 03:03:41,440
positive real values, both in the first quadrant and the third quadrant. So there are going to be

1440
03:03:41,440 --> 03:03:48,080
two places on the unit circle where the tangent is four. We've already found this one.

1441
03:03:49,200 --> 03:03:51,760
To find the other one, we just need to add pi.

1442
03:03:51,760 --> 03:03:59,360
This gives us our answer for the interval zero to two pi, and we can add multiples of two pi to get all

1443
03:03:59,360 --> 03:04:05,280
other solutions. Or if we want to be more efficient, we can just write the first solution

1444
03:04:07,280 --> 03:04:13,600
plus multiples of pi instead of two pi. Because these two solutions differ by exactly pi,

1445
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:21,360
taking the first solution and then adding multiples of pi will capture all solutions,

1446
03:04:21,440 --> 03:04:24,240
corresponding to both of these principle solutions.

1447
03:04:26,400 --> 03:04:35,840
To summarize, to find all solutions to cosine t equals m, we need to find first cosine inverse of m,

1448
03:04:37,520 --> 03:04:44,880
then take two pi minus this solution and add multiples of two pi to both of those.

1449
03:04:45,840 --> 03:04:54,480
To find solutions to the equation, sine t equals n, we can start by taking sine inverse of n,

1450
03:04:55,440 --> 03:05:00,480
using pi minus this, and adding multiples of two pi.

1451
03:05:02,640 --> 03:05:11,840
To find all solutions to tangent t equals p, we can take t equal tan inverse of p and

1452
03:05:12,240 --> 03:05:22,160
tan inverse of p plus pi and add multiples of two pi. Or we can just take tan inverse of p

1453
03:05:22,160 --> 03:05:29,680
and add multiples of pi. Although the examples that we saw were more simple than some, because

1454
03:05:29,680 --> 03:05:35,920
for the examples we saw, the inverse trig function always landed us in the first quadrant. These

1455
03:05:36,880 --> 03:05:42,720
methods will work more generally. That's all for this video on solving trig equations that

1456
03:05:42,720 --> 03:05:50,160
require a calculator. This video is about identities involving trig functions, like sine and cosine.

1457
03:05:51,200 --> 03:05:55,040
But I want to start with some examples that just involve quadratic functions.

1458
03:05:56,880 --> 03:06:04,800
If I want to find the solutions to this equation, I can rewrite it x squared minus six x minus seven

1459
03:06:04,800 --> 03:06:14,480
equals zero, factor it x minus seven times x plus one equals zero, set the factors equal to zero,

1460
03:06:15,120 --> 03:06:22,640
x minus seven equals zero, or x plus one equals zero. And that gives me the solutions x equals seven

1461
03:06:23,280 --> 03:06:30,000
or x equals negative one. Next, let's look at this more complicated equation.

1462
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:36,720
I'm going to try to solve that for x by multiplying out the right hand side.

1463
03:06:38,560 --> 03:06:45,760
Next, I'll combine terms on the right hand side. So that gives me x squared minus six x

1464
03:06:46,880 --> 03:06:54,320
on both sides. Well, x squared minus six x is equal to x squared minus six x. That's true no

1465
03:06:54,320 --> 03:07:01,200
matter what I plug in for x. And therefore, all values of x satisfy this equation.

1466
03:07:02,240 --> 03:07:05,280
We can say that the solution set is all real numbers.

1467
03:07:07,920 --> 03:07:12,320
The second equation is called an identity because it holds

1468
03:07:14,240 --> 03:07:21,600
for all values of the variable. The first equation on the other hand is not an identity

1469
03:07:21,600 --> 03:07:25,200
because it only holds for some values of x and not all values.

1470
03:07:26,800 --> 03:07:32,400
Please pause the video for a moment and try to decide which of the following three equations

1471
03:07:32,400 --> 03:07:38,160
are identities, that is, which of these equations hold for all values of the variable.

1472
03:07:39,840 --> 03:07:44,720
To start out, you might want to test them by plugging in a few values of the variable and

1473
03:07:44,800 --> 03:07:52,160
see if the equation holds. The first equation is not an identity.

1474
03:07:53,840 --> 03:08:00,800
It does hold for some values of x. For example, if x equals zero, then sine of two times zero

1475
03:08:01,440 --> 03:08:08,400
is zero, and two times sine of zero is also zero. So it does hold when x is zero.

1476
03:08:09,120 --> 03:08:16,720
However, when x is say pi over two, then sine of two times pi over two, that's the same thing as

1477
03:08:16,720 --> 03:08:25,840
sine of pi, which is zero, but two times sine of pi over two, that's two times one or two.

1478
03:08:26,560 --> 03:08:32,640
And zero is not equal to two. So the equation does not hold for x equals pi over two.

1479
03:08:32,640 --> 03:08:37,760
Since it doesn't hold for all values of the variable, it's not an identity.

1480
03:08:39,440 --> 03:08:47,280
The second equation is an identity. You can build some evidence for this by plugging in numbers,

1481
03:08:47,280 --> 03:08:54,160
for example, cosine of zero plus pi, which is negative one is the same thing as negative of

1482
03:08:54,160 --> 03:09:01,280
cosine of zero. You can also check, for example, that cosine of pi over six plus pi is the same

1483
03:09:01,280 --> 03:09:07,280
thing as negative cosine of pi over six. But even if we check a zillion examples, that's just

1484
03:09:07,280 --> 03:09:11,360
evidence, it's not a proof that the identity holds, we could have just gotten lucky with the

1485
03:09:11,360 --> 03:09:17,840
values we picked. We can build a little bit stronger evidence by looking at graphs.

1486
03:09:19,280 --> 03:09:28,240
I'm going to put theta on the x axis. And if I graph y equals cosine of theta plus pi,

1487
03:09:28,240 --> 03:09:35,040
that's just like the graph of cosine shifted over to the left by pi. On the other hand,

1488
03:09:35,040 --> 03:09:40,960
if I graph y equals negative cosine theta, that's the graph of cosine theta,

1489
03:09:42,240 --> 03:09:47,360
reflected across the x axis, which gives us the exact same graph.

1490
03:09:48,960 --> 03:09:54,160
So graphing both sides gives us strong evidence that this equation is an identity,

1491
03:09:54,160 --> 03:09:59,840
it holds for all values of theta. Now the strongest evidence of all would be an algebraic

1492
03:09:59,840 --> 03:10:05,760
proof, which we'll do later in the course, once we have a formula for the cosine of a sum of two

1493
03:10:05,760 --> 03:10:15,120
angles. In the meantime, let's look at equation C. It turns out equation C is an identity.

1494
03:10:16,400 --> 03:10:20,640
And we could build evidence for it again by plugging in values for x or by graphing the

1495
03:10:20,640 --> 03:10:26,160
left side and the right side separately and checking to see that the graphs coincided.

1496
03:10:26,880 --> 03:10:31,120
But for this example, I'm going to go ahead and do an algebraic verification.

1497
03:10:32,400 --> 03:10:35,440
In particular, I'm going to start with the left side of the equation,

1498
03:10:36,560 --> 03:10:40,800
and rewrite things and rewrite things until I get to the right side of the equation.

1499
03:10:41,920 --> 03:10:47,760
The first thing I'll rewrite is secant and tangent in terms of their constituent functions,

1500
03:10:47,760 --> 03:10:56,000
sine and cosine. Since secant of x is one over cosine x and tangent of x is sine x over cosine x,

1501
03:10:56,000 --> 03:11:06,640
I can rewrite this expression as one over cosine x minus sine x times sine x over cosine x.

1502
03:11:08,800 --> 03:11:16,880
I can clean up those fractions and write this as one over cosine x minus sine squared x

1503
03:11:16,880 --> 03:11:22,880
over cosine x. Now I notice that I have two fractions with the same denominator.

1504
03:11:23,600 --> 03:11:30,240
So I can pull them together as one minus sine squared x over cosine x.

1505
03:11:32,320 --> 03:11:39,360
Next, I'm going to rewrite the numerator one minus sine squared x using the Pythagorean identity

1506
03:11:39,360 --> 03:11:47,120
that says that cosine squared x plus sine squared x equals one. And therefore,

1507
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:56,800
one minus sine squared x is equal to cosine squared x, just by subtracting sine squared x from both

1508
03:11:56,800 --> 03:12:06,320
sides. So I can replace my numerator one minus sine squared x with cosine squared x

1509
03:12:09,600 --> 03:12:16,160
and canceling one cosine from the top and from the bottom. That's the same thing as cosine of x,

1510
03:12:16,160 --> 03:12:21,920
which is the right hand side that I was trying to get to. So a combination of a bunch of algebra

1511
03:12:22,560 --> 03:12:29,600
and the Pythagorean identity allows me to prove that this equation is true for all values of x,

1512
03:12:29,600 --> 03:12:34,800
it's an identity. The best way to prove that an equation is an identity

1513
03:12:36,080 --> 03:12:43,520
is to use algebra and to use other identities like the Pythagorean identity

1514
03:12:44,640 --> 03:12:49,200
to rewrite one side of the equation till it looks like the other side.

1515
03:12:49,520 --> 03:12:54,720
The best way to prove that an equation is not an identity is to plug in numbers

1516
03:12:55,600 --> 03:13:02,320
that break the identity that is make the equation not true. Now, if you're just trying to decide if

1517
03:13:02,320 --> 03:13:08,320
an equation is an identity or not, and not worried about proving it, then I recommend plugging in

1518
03:13:08,320 --> 03:13:13,440
numbers or graphing the left and right sides to see if those graphs are the same.

1519
03:13:13,440 --> 03:13:21,760
Recall that an identity is an equation that holds for all values of the variable.

1520
03:13:22,880 --> 03:13:27,520
This video states and proves three identities called the Pythagorean identities.

1521
03:13:28,400 --> 03:13:35,760
The first one is the familiar cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one.

1522
03:13:35,760 --> 03:13:43,680
The second one says tan squared theta plus one equals secant squared theta.

1523
03:13:44,480 --> 03:13:51,280
And the third one goes cotangent squared theta plus one equals cosecant squared theta.

1524
03:13:52,720 --> 03:13:57,520
Let's start by proving that cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one.

1525
03:13:58,960 --> 03:14:03,520
I'll do this by drawing the unit circle with the right triangle inside it.

1526
03:14:04,480 --> 03:14:09,600
By the definition of sine and cosine, the x and y coordinates of this top point

1527
03:14:10,320 --> 03:14:18,160
are cosine theta and sine theta. The hypotenuse of my triangle is one, since that's the radius

1528
03:14:18,160 --> 03:14:26,880
of my unit circle. Now, the length of the base of my triangle is the same thing as the x coordinate

1529
03:14:27,680 --> 03:14:37,120
of this point. So that's equal to cosine theta. The height of this triangle is the same thing as

1530
03:14:37,120 --> 03:14:45,680
the y coordinate of this point. So that's sine theta. Now, the Pythagorean theorem for right

1531
03:14:45,680 --> 03:14:51,920
triangles says this side length squared plus that side length squared is equal to the hypotenuse squared.

1532
03:14:52,880 --> 03:15:02,640
So by the Pythagorean theorem, we have that cosine theta squared plus sine theta squared

1533
03:15:02,640 --> 03:15:11,200
equals one squared. I can rewrite that as cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one,

1534
03:15:11,760 --> 03:15:18,320
since one squared is one and cosine squared theta is just a shorthand notation for cosine theta squared.

1535
03:15:18,320 --> 03:15:24,720
That completes the proof of the first Pythagorean identity, at least in the case when the angle

1536
03:15:24,720 --> 03:15:30,400
theta is in the first quadrant. In the case when the angle lies in a different quadrant,

1537
03:15:30,960 --> 03:15:36,800
you can use symmetry to argue the same identity holds. But I won't give the details here.

1538
03:15:37,920 --> 03:15:43,760
To prove the next Pythagorean identity tan squared theta plus one equals secant squared theta,

1539
03:15:43,760 --> 03:15:50,160
let's use the first Pythagorean identity, which said that cosine squared theta plus sine squared

1540
03:15:50,160 --> 03:15:58,320
theta equals one. I'm going to divide both sides of this equation by cosine squared theta.

1541
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:03,440
Now I'm going to rewrite the left side by breaking apart the fraction

1542
03:16:04,240 --> 03:16:12,080
into cosine squared theta over cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta over cosine squared theta.

1543
03:16:12,320 --> 03:16:19,040
Now cosine squared theta over cosine squared theta is just one. And I can rewrite the next

1544
03:16:19,040 --> 03:16:28,480
fraction as sine of theta over cosine of theta squared. That's because when I square a fraction,

1545
03:16:28,480 --> 03:16:34,080
I can just square the numerator and square the denominator. And sine squared theta is

1546
03:16:34,080 --> 03:16:38,000
shorthand for sine of theta squared, similarly for cosine squared theta.

1547
03:16:38,160 --> 03:16:47,120
Now on the other side of the equal sign, I can rewrite this fraction as one over cosine theta

1548
03:16:47,120 --> 03:16:54,000
squared. Again, that's because when I square the fraction, I just get the one squared, which is one

1549
03:16:54,000 --> 03:17:00,080
divided by the cosine theta squared, which is this. I'm almost done.

1550
03:17:00,880 --> 03:17:04,480
Sine theta over cosine theta is the same thing as tangent theta.

1551
03:17:04,800 --> 03:17:13,920
And one over cosine theta is the same thing as secant theta. Using the shorthand notation,

1552
03:17:14,480 --> 03:17:22,560
this says one plus tan squared theta equals secant squared theta, which after rearranging

1553
03:17:24,160 --> 03:17:29,760
is exactly the identity that we were looking for. The proof of the third

1554
03:17:29,760 --> 03:17:35,920
for that green identity is very similar. Once again, I'll start with the identity cosine

1555
03:17:35,920 --> 03:17:42,560
squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one. And this time I'll divide both sides by sine

1556
03:17:42,560 --> 03:17:50,880
squared theta. I'll break up the fraction on the left. And now I'll rewrite my fractions as cosine

1557
03:17:50,880 --> 03:18:01,840
theta over sine theta squared plus one equals one over sine theta squared. Cosine over sine can be

1558
03:18:01,840 --> 03:18:14,640
written as cotangent. And one over sine can be written as cosecant. That gives me the identity

1559
03:18:14,640 --> 03:18:22,640
that I'm looking for. We've now proved three trig identities. The first one, we proved using the

1560
03:18:22,640 --> 03:18:33,440
unit circle and the Pythagorean theorem. The second and third identities, we proved by using the first

1561
03:18:33,440 --> 03:18:40,960
identity and a bit of algebra. The sum and difference formulas are formulas for computing

1562
03:18:40,960 --> 03:18:49,200
the sine of a sum of two angles, the cosine of a sum of two angles, the sine of a difference of

1563
03:18:49,200 --> 03:18:56,560
two angles, and the cosine of a difference of two angles. Please pause the video for a moment to

1564
03:18:56,560 --> 03:19:04,000
think about this question. Is it true that the sine of a plus b is equal to the sine of a plus the

1565
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:16,000
sine of b? No, it's not true. And we can see by an example, if we plug in say a equals pi over two

1566
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:24,240
and b equals pi, then the sine of pi over two plus pi is the same thing as a sine of three pi over

1567
03:19:24,320 --> 03:19:34,240
two, which is negative one, whereas the sine of pi over two plus the sine of pi is equal to one plus

1568
03:19:34,240 --> 03:19:42,240
zero, which is one negative one is not equal to one. So this equation does not hold for all values

1569
03:19:42,240 --> 03:19:49,280
of a and b. There are a few values of a and b for which it does hold. For example, if a is zero and

1570
03:19:49,280 --> 03:19:57,440
b is zero, but it's not true in general. Instead, we need more complicated formulas. It turns out

1571
03:19:57,440 --> 03:20:08,560
that the sine of the sum of two angles a plus b is given by sine of a cosine of b plus cosine of a

1572
03:20:09,280 --> 03:20:20,560
sine of b. The cosine of a plus b is given by cosine a cosine b minus sine a sine b.

1573
03:20:21,760 --> 03:20:29,680
I like to remember these with a song, sine cosine cosine sine cosine cosine minus sine sine.

1574
03:20:31,040 --> 03:20:33,520
Please feel free to back up the video and sing along with me.

1575
03:20:33,760 --> 03:20:39,760
I encourage you to memorize the two formulas for the sine of a sum of angles and the cosine of a

1576
03:20:39,760 --> 03:20:46,000
sum of angles. Once you do, it's easy to figure out the sine and cosine of a difference of two

1577
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:54,560
angles. One way to do this is to think of sine of a minus b as sine of a plus negative b,

1578
03:20:54,560 --> 03:21:06,800
and then use the angle sum formula. So this works out to sine cosine plus cosine

1579
03:21:08,560 --> 03:21:17,440
sine. And now, if I use the fact that cosine is even, I know that cosine of negative b is cosine of

1580
03:21:17,440 --> 03:21:28,800
b. And since sine is odd, sine of negative b is negative sine of b. So I can rewrite this as

1581
03:21:28,800 --> 03:21:38,160
sine of a cosine of b minus cosine of a sine of b. Notice that this new formula for the difference

1582
03:21:38,160 --> 03:21:43,360
is the same as the formula for the sum is just that plus sign turned into a minus sign.

1583
03:21:43,920 --> 03:21:50,640
We can do the same trick for cosine of a minus b, that's cosine of a plus minus b,

1584
03:21:52,000 --> 03:22:03,040
which is cosine a cosine minus b minus sine of a sine of negative b. Again, using even an odd

1585
03:22:03,120 --> 03:22:14,000
properties, this gives us cosine a cosine b plus sine a sine b. Once again, the formula for the

1586
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:19,360
difference is almost exactly like the formula for the sum, just that minus sign has switched to a

1587
03:22:19,360 --> 03:22:27,280
plus sign. Now let's use the angle sum formulas to find the exact value for the sine of 105 degrees.

1588
03:22:27,760 --> 03:22:34,480
Now 105 degrees is not a special angle on the unit circle. But I can write it as the sum

1589
03:22:34,480 --> 03:22:44,080
of two special angles, I can write it as 60 degrees plus 45 degrees. Therefore, the sine of 105 degrees

1590
03:22:44,400 --> 03:22:57,760
is the sine of 68 plus 45. And now by the angle sum formula, this is sine, cosine, cosine,

1591
03:22:59,120 --> 03:23:07,600
sine. And I for my unit circle, I can figure out that sine of 60 degrees is root three over two,

1592
03:23:07,680 --> 03:23:15,360
cosine of 45 degrees, root two over two, cosine of 60 degrees is one half, and sine of 45 degrees

1593
03:23:15,360 --> 03:23:23,120
is root two over two. So this simplifies to root six plus root two over four.

1594
03:23:25,440 --> 03:23:32,800
For our last example, let's find the cosine of v plus w, given the values of cosine v and cosine

1595
03:23:32,800 --> 03:23:40,400
w, and the fact that v and w are angles in the first quadrant. Remember, to compute the cosine

1596
03:23:40,400 --> 03:23:45,280
of a sum, we can't just add together the two cosines, that wouldn't even make sense in this case,

1597
03:23:45,280 --> 03:23:48,800
because adding point nine and point seven would give something bigger than one,

1598
03:23:48,800 --> 03:23:54,720
and the cosine of something's never bigger than one. Instead, we have to use the angle sum formula

1599
03:23:54,720 --> 03:24:07,200
for cosine. So that goes cosine of v plus w equals cosine, cosine, minus sine, sine. Now,

1600
03:24:07,200 --> 03:24:12,320
I'm already know the cosine of v and the cosine of w, so I could just plug those in. But I have

1601
03:24:12,320 --> 03:24:18,800
to figure out the sine of v and the sine of w from the given information. And one way to do that is

1602
03:24:18,880 --> 03:24:24,720
to draw right triangles. So here I'm going to draw a right triangle with angle v,

1603
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:29,280
and another right triangle with angle w.

1604
03:24:31,600 --> 03:24:39,360
Since I know that the cosine of v is point nine, I can think of that as nine over 10,

1605
03:24:39,360 --> 03:24:45,120
and I can think of that as adjacent over hypotenuse in my right triangle. So I'll

1606
03:24:45,120 --> 03:24:49,680
decorate my triangles adjacent side with the number nine and the hypotenuse with 10.

1607
03:24:50,960 --> 03:24:56,080
Similarly, since I know that the cosine of w is point seven, which is seven tenths,

1608
03:24:56,080 --> 03:25:00,480
I can put a seven on this adjacent side, and a 10 on this hypotenuse.

1609
03:25:02,560 --> 03:25:06,640
Now the Pythagorean theorem, let's me compute the length of the unlabeled side.

1610
03:25:07,760 --> 03:25:12,000
So this one is going to be the square root of 10 squared minus nine squared,

1611
03:25:12,720 --> 03:25:18,640
that's going to be the square root of 19. And here I have the square root of 10 squared minus

1612
03:25:18,640 --> 03:25:27,280
seven squared. So that's the square root of 51. I can now find the sine of v as the opposite

1613
03:25:27,280 --> 03:25:33,120
over the hypotenuse. So that's the square root of 19 over 10. And the sine of w

1614
03:25:34,160 --> 03:25:41,520
will be the square root of 51 over 10. Because we're assuming v and w are in the first quadrant,

1615
03:25:42,000 --> 03:25:47,360
we know the values of sine need to be positive. So we don't need to jimmy around with positive

1616
03:25:47,360 --> 03:25:53,760
or negative signs in our answers, we can just leave them as is. Now we're ready to plug into our

1617
03:25:53,760 --> 03:26:04,640
formula. So we have that cosine of v plus w is equal to point nine times point seven minus the

1618
03:26:04,640 --> 03:26:12,960
square root of 19 over 10 times the square root of 51 over 10. Using a calculator, this works out

1619
03:26:12,960 --> 03:26:22,720
to a decimal approximation of 0.3187. This video gave the angle sum and difference formulas

1620
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:29,920
and use them to compute some values. To see a proof for why the sum formulas hold,

1621
03:26:30,640 --> 03:26:37,840
please watch my other video. Remember the angle sum formulas? Those are the formulas for computing

1622
03:26:37,840 --> 03:26:50,000
sine of a plus b and cosine of a plus b. I like to sing them sine cosine cosine sine

1623
03:26:51,760 --> 03:27:03,360
cosine cosine minus sine sine. This video gives a geometric proof of those formulas.

1624
03:27:04,320 --> 03:27:08,320
There are many great proofs of the angle sum formulas, but I'd like to share with you one of my

1625
03:27:08,320 --> 03:27:14,080
favorites for those who are interested. I'll write the angle sum formulas up here. So we'll

1626
03:27:14,080 --> 03:27:20,480
know what we're trying to prove. To prove these formulas, let me start by drawing an angle a

1627
03:27:23,280 --> 03:27:25,440
and an angle b on top of that.

1628
03:27:26,320 --> 03:27:33,120
Next, I'm going to draw a line perpendicular to this middle line. And I'm going to extend the top

1629
03:27:33,120 --> 03:27:40,960
line until it meets that perpendicular, making a right triangle. Finally, I'll draw a rectangle

1630
03:27:40,960 --> 03:27:48,240
around that right triangle that just touches its vertices. My rectangle is now divided up into

1631
03:27:48,240 --> 03:27:53,360
four right triangles. And I'm going to choose units of measurement so that the hypotenuse

1632
03:27:53,440 --> 03:28:00,080
of my middle triangle has length one. Now let's stop for a minute to think about the angles of

1633
03:28:00,080 --> 03:28:07,200
these other triangles. Since the top and the bottom edge of the rectangle are parallel lines,

1634
03:28:08,480 --> 03:28:17,440
and this hypotenuse is a transversal, this angle up here must have the same measure as a plus b

1635
03:28:17,840 --> 03:28:26,160
down here. Also, this skinny angle here must have the same measure as a down here.

1636
03:28:28,000 --> 03:28:37,680
Because this angle is 180 degrees minus 90 degrees minus this angle here. And this angle a is also

1637
03:28:37,680 --> 03:28:44,640
180 degrees, the measure of the angles in the triangle minus 90 degrees minus that same angle.

1638
03:28:44,640 --> 03:28:52,480
So I'll label this skinny angle with a. Next, let's figure out as many side lengths as we can.

1639
03:28:53,520 --> 03:28:59,760
Based on the middle right triangle with hypotenuse one, we know that this side length down here

1640
03:28:59,760 --> 03:29:07,200
must be cosine of b. Since adjacent over hypotenuse is cosine b. Similarly, this side length here

1641
03:29:07,200 --> 03:29:25,760
must be sine of b. Since opposite over hypotenuse is sine of b. Now we see that sine of b is the

1642
03:29:26,320 --> 03:29:36,800
of this right triangle, which means that this little side here has measure sine a times sine b.

1643
03:29:39,440 --> 03:29:45,520
That's because the opposite over the hypotenuse of this angle has to equal sine a.

1644
03:29:47,040 --> 03:29:52,880
A similar argument shows that this side has to have measure cosine a times sine b.

1645
03:29:53,440 --> 03:29:58,400
Please pause the video and take a moment to fill in the side lengths of this right triangle

1646
03:29:59,680 --> 03:30:11,840
and this right triangle. You should be getting sine a cosine b cosine a cosine b

1647
03:30:12,800 --> 03:30:15,680
sine of a plus b

1648
03:30:18,480 --> 03:30:20,320
and cosine of a plus b.

1649
03:30:25,200 --> 03:30:30,400
But remember, we have a rectangle here. So the opposite sides have equal lengths.

1650
03:30:31,120 --> 03:30:40,000
This tells us that sine of a plus b has to equal sine of a cosine of b plus cosine of a sine of b,

1651
03:30:40,000 --> 03:30:48,720
which is exactly the first angle sum formula. Also, cosine of a plus b, which is this side length,

1652
03:30:48,720 --> 03:30:56,720
is exactly the difference of this side length cosine a cosine b minus this side length sine of a

1653
03:30:56,720 --> 03:31:04,080
sine b. And that's the second angle sum formula. So I think that's a pretty great geometric proof

1654
03:31:04,080 --> 03:31:13,760
of the angle sum formulas. This video gives formulas for sine of two theta and cosine of two theta.

1655
03:31:14,960 --> 03:31:20,640
Please pause the video for a moment and see if you think this equation sine of two theta equals

1656
03:31:20,720 --> 03:31:28,720
sine theta is true or false. Remember that true means always true for all values of theta,

1657
03:31:28,720 --> 03:31:31,200
where false means sometimes are always false.

1658
03:31:33,680 --> 03:31:38,080
This equation is false because it's not true for all values of theta.

1659
03:31:38,880 --> 03:31:44,960
One way to see this is graphically. If I graph y equals sine of two theta,

1660
03:31:45,520 --> 03:31:53,360
that's like the graph of sine theta squished in horizontally by a factor of one half.

1661
03:31:54,640 --> 03:32:01,680
On the other hand, if I graph y equals to sine theta, that's like the graph of sine theta

1662
03:32:01,680 --> 03:32:06,960
stretched vertically by a factor of two. These two graphs are not the same.

1663
03:32:08,240 --> 03:32:12,560
So instead, we need a more complicated formula for sine of two theta.

1664
03:32:13,280 --> 03:32:20,880
And that formula is sine of two theta is two sine theta cosine theta.

1665
03:32:22,000 --> 03:32:26,480
It's not hard to see why that formula works based on the angle sum formula.

1666
03:32:27,440 --> 03:32:37,280
Recall that sine of a plus b is equal to sine a cosine b plus cosine a sine b.

1667
03:32:37,760 --> 03:32:46,960
Sine b. Therefore, sine of two theta, which is sine of theta plus theta is going to be sine theta

1668
03:32:47,520 --> 03:32:55,360
cosine theta plus cosine theta sine theta, simply plugging in theta for a and theta for b

1669
03:32:56,160 --> 03:33:03,600
in this angle sum formula. Well, sine theta cosine theta is the same thing as cosine theta sine theta.

1670
03:33:03,600 --> 03:33:13,120
So I can rewrite this as twice sine theta cosine theta. That gives me this formula.

1671
03:33:15,200 --> 03:33:23,040
There's also a formula for cosine of two theta. And that formula is cosine squared theta minus

1672
03:33:23,040 --> 03:33:30,720
sine squared theta. Again, we can use the angle sum formula to see where this comes from.

1673
03:33:31,680 --> 03:33:41,600
Cosine of a plus b is equal to cosine of a cosine of b minus sine a sine b. So if we want cosine

1674
03:33:41,600 --> 03:33:49,200
of two theta, that's just cosine of theta plus theta, which is cosine theta cosine theta minus

1675
03:33:49,200 --> 03:33:54,880
sine theta sine theta by plugging in theta for a and b.

1676
03:33:55,760 --> 03:34:01,760
This can be rewritten as cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta, which is exactly the formula

1677
03:34:01,760 --> 03:34:08,960
above. Now there are a couple other formulas for cosine of two theta that are also popular. One

1678
03:34:08,960 --> 03:34:18,080
of them is one minus two sine squared theta. And the other one is cosine of two theta is two

1679
03:34:18,160 --> 03:34:28,880
cosine squared theta minus one. You can get each of these two formulas from the original one

1680
03:34:29,600 --> 03:34:36,000
using the Pythagorean identity. We know that cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta

1681
03:34:36,000 --> 03:34:44,000
is one. So cosine squared theta is one minus sine squared theta. If I plug that into my original

1682
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:52,640
formula, which I've copied here, so I'm plugging in instead of cosine squared, I'm going to write

1683
03:34:52,640 --> 03:34:58,880
one minus sine squared theta, I still have another minus sine squared theta. So that's the same thing

1684
03:34:58,880 --> 03:35:06,720
as one minus twice sine squared theta, which is exactly what I'm looking for. Similarly,

1685
03:35:07,520 --> 03:35:14,400
I can use the Pythagorean identity to write sine squared theta as one minus cosine squared theta.

1686
03:35:16,000 --> 03:35:23,680
Again, I'll take this equation and copy it below. But this time I'm going to plug in for sine

1687
03:35:23,680 --> 03:35:31,520
squared right here. So that gives me cosine of two theta is cosine squared theta minus the quantity

1688
03:35:32,080 --> 03:35:40,400
one minus cosine squared theta. That simplifies to two cosine squared theta minus one after

1689
03:35:40,400 --> 03:35:47,280
distributing the negative sign and combining like terms. So I have one double angle formula

1690
03:35:47,280 --> 03:35:52,000
for sine of two theta, and I have three versions of the double angle formula for cosine of two

1691
03:35:52,000 --> 03:35:59,360
theta. Now let's use these formulas in some examples. Let's find the cosine of two theta

1692
03:35:59,360 --> 03:36:05,680
if we know that cosine theta is negative one over root 10, and theta terminates in quadrant three.

1693
03:36:06,880 --> 03:36:13,760
We have a choice of three formulas for cosine of two theta. I'm going to choose the second one,

1694
03:36:13,760 --> 03:36:19,200
because it only involves cosine of theta on the right side. And I already know my value for cosine

1695
03:36:19,200 --> 03:36:25,120
theta. Of course, I could use one of the other ones, but then I'd have to work out the value of

1696
03:36:25,120 --> 03:36:33,280
sine theta. So plugging in, I get cosine of two theta is twice negative one over root 10

1697
03:36:33,280 --> 03:36:42,000
squared minus one, which simplifies to two tenths minus one or negative eight tenths, negative

1698
03:36:42,000 --> 03:36:49,600
four fifths. Finally, let's solve the equation to cosine x plus sine of two x equals zero.

1699
03:36:49,600 --> 03:36:56,240
What makes this equation tricky is that one of the trig functions has the argument of just x,

1700
03:36:56,240 --> 03:37:01,360
but the other trig function has the argument of two x. So I want to use my double angle formula

1701
03:37:01,360 --> 03:37:10,400
to rewrite sine of two x. I'll copy down the two cosine x, and now sine of two x is equal to two

1702
03:37:11,120 --> 03:37:21,040
sine x cosine x. At this point, I see a way to factor my equation, I can factor out a two cosine

1703
03:37:21,040 --> 03:37:32,800
x from both of these two terms. That gives me one plus sine x, and the product there is equal to

1704
03:37:32,800 --> 03:37:41,200
zero. That means that either two cosine x is equal to zero, or one plus sine x is equal to zero.

1705
03:37:42,080 --> 03:37:49,440
That simplifies to cosine x equals zero, or sine x is negative one. Using my unit circle,

1706
03:37:49,440 --> 03:38:00,800
I see that cosine of x is zero at pi over two, and three pi over two, while sine of x is negative

1707
03:38:00,800 --> 03:38:10,240
one at three pi over two. There's some redundancy here, but my solution set is going to be pi over

1708
03:38:10,240 --> 03:38:19,920
two plus multiples of two pi, and three pi over two plus multiples of two pi. This video proved

1709
03:38:19,920 --> 03:38:26,800
the double angle formulas sine of two theta is two sine theta cosine theta. And cosine of two

1710
03:38:26,800 --> 03:38:34,560
theta is cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta. It also proved two alternate versions

1711
03:38:35,520 --> 03:38:43,440
of the equation for cosine of two theta. This video is about the half angle formulas for computing

1712
03:38:43,440 --> 03:38:53,840
cosine of theta over two, and sine of theta over two. Cosine of theta over two is either plus or minus

1713
03:38:53,840 --> 03:39:03,120
the square root of one plus cosine theta all over two. To figure out whether to use plus or minus,

1714
03:39:03,280 --> 03:39:09,040
you need to know something about what quadrant the angle theta over two is. If you're expecting

1715
03:39:09,040 --> 03:39:13,920
cosine theta over two to be negative, then you're going to need the negative sign. You're expecting

1716
03:39:13,920 --> 03:39:18,080
this cosine to be positive. Then of course you want the positive sign since the square root of

1717
03:39:18,080 --> 03:39:24,240
something is always positive. Notice that this formula always makes sense, because the inside

1718
03:39:24,240 --> 03:39:29,680
of the square root sign is always going to be positive or zero, since cosine theta can't be

1719
03:39:29,680 --> 03:39:36,400
any more negative than negative one. We have a similar formula for sine of theta over two. And

1720
03:39:36,400 --> 03:39:45,280
that's plus or minus the square root of one minus cosine theta over two. Notice that the formulas for

1721
03:39:45,280 --> 03:39:51,680
both cosine of a half angle and sine of a half angle, both have cosine in them, they just differ

1722
03:39:51,680 --> 03:39:59,040
by the positive or negative sign in the inside of the square root. To see why these formulas hold,

1723
03:39:59,040 --> 03:40:07,440
let's recall the formulas for double angles. We know that cosine of two x is equal to two

1724
03:40:07,440 --> 03:40:17,280
cosine squared x minus one, or we can write cosine of two x as one minus two sine squared of x. Of

1725
03:40:17,280 --> 03:40:25,200
course, we can also write cosine of two x as cosine squared x minus sine squared x, but this one

1726
03:40:25,200 --> 03:40:31,840
won't be relevant to our discussion right now. So I'm going to start with this first formula.

1727
03:40:32,560 --> 03:40:39,520
And I'm going to make the substitution theta equals two x. That allows me to write cosine theta

1728
03:40:40,080 --> 03:40:49,280
is two cosine squared theta over two minus one, since if theta is two x, then x is theta over two.

1729
03:40:49,520 --> 03:40:59,040
So now I'm going to solve for cosine of theta over two. So I'll add one to both sides,

1730
03:41:02,480 --> 03:41:04,000
divide both sides by two,

1731
03:41:08,800 --> 03:41:14,880
and take the square root of both sides. That gives me that cosine of theta over two is going to be

1732
03:41:14,880 --> 03:41:20,720
plus or minus the square root of cosine theta plus one over two, which is the formula we're looking

1733
03:41:20,720 --> 03:41:29,280
for. I can carry a similar process out with the second formula. I'll substitute theta for two x,

1734
03:41:29,280 --> 03:41:36,800
which means that x is theta over two, that gives me cosine theta is one minus two sine squared theta

1735
03:41:36,800 --> 03:41:47,200
over two. Now I'll solve for sine of theta over two. I'll start by adding two sine squared theta

1736
03:41:47,200 --> 03:41:56,400
over two to both sides. Next, I'll subtract cosine theta from both sides. Next, I'll divide both sides

1737
03:41:56,400 --> 03:42:05,200
by two. And finally, I'll take the square root of both sides. That gives me sine of theta over two

1738
03:42:05,200 --> 03:42:11,680
is plus or minus the square root of one minus cosine theta over two, which is the formula I was

1739
03:42:11,680 --> 03:42:18,240
looking for. Now that we've got our formulas, and know where they come from, let's use them in an

1740
03:42:18,240 --> 03:42:24,720
example. Let's suppose that sine theta is four fifths, and theta is between pi over two and pi.

1741
03:42:25,920 --> 03:42:33,440
That means it's in the second quadrant. We want to find the exact values of cosine theta over two

1742
03:42:33,440 --> 03:42:41,120
and sine theta over two. Since theta is between pi over two and pi, theta over two will be between

1743
03:42:41,120 --> 03:42:51,200
pi over four and pi over two. So theta over two is somewhere in the first quadrant. That means

1744
03:42:51,200 --> 03:42:58,240
that cosine theta over two and sine theta over two will both be positive. Let me write down my

1745
03:42:58,240 --> 03:43:04,240
half angle formulas. And I know I could ignore the negative version and just use the positive

1746
03:43:04,240 --> 03:43:09,360
version. Now, unfortunately, I'm just given the value of sine theta, not cosine theta. So I can't

1747
03:43:09,360 --> 03:43:15,840
plug in directly. First, I have to use this value to figure out what cosine might be. I'll draw a

1748
03:43:15,840 --> 03:43:23,760
right triangle with angle theta. And since sine of theta is four fifths, I'll decorate the triangle

1749
03:43:23,760 --> 03:43:30,480
with a four and a five on the hypotenuse. That means that this side length is going to be five

1750
03:43:30,480 --> 03:43:36,160
squared, square root of five squared minus four squared, which is the square root of nine, which

1751
03:43:36,160 --> 03:43:46,320
is three. That means that cosine theta is going to be either plus or minus three fifths, because

1752
03:43:46,320 --> 03:43:53,760
it's adjacent over hypotenuse. Now, since I'm in the angle, the second quadrant for my angle theta,

1753
03:43:54,320 --> 03:44:00,960
cosine is actually going to be negative three fifths. Now I can plug into my formulas.

1754
03:44:01,840 --> 03:44:08,080
I get that cosine of theta over two is going to be the square root of one minus three fifths

1755
03:44:08,080 --> 03:44:14,880
over two. That simplifies to the square root of two fifths divided by two, which is the square

1756
03:44:14,880 --> 03:44:23,360
root of one fifth, or one over the square to five. sine of theta over two is the square root of one

1757
03:44:23,360 --> 03:44:31,760
minus cosine theta. So that's one minus negative three fifths over two. That's the square root of

1758
03:44:32,960 --> 03:44:39,440
one plus three fifths, or eight fifths over two, the square root of four fifths, or two over the

1759
03:44:39,520 --> 03:44:46,720
square root of five. In this video, we found formulas for the cosine of a half angle, and the

1760
03:44:46,720 --> 03:44:54,720
sine of a half angle, and use them in an example. Solving a right triangle means finding the lengths

1761
03:44:54,720 --> 03:45:02,960
of all the sides, and the measures of the angles, given partial information. In this example,

1762
03:45:03,520 --> 03:45:09,520
we're given the length of one side, and the measure of one angle, plus we know the measure

1763
03:45:09,520 --> 03:45:16,160
of this right angle is 90 degrees. We need to find the measure of the third angle, labeled

1764
03:45:16,160 --> 03:45:23,760
capital A, and the lengths of the two sides labeled lowercase b and lowercase c. To find the measure

1765
03:45:23,760 --> 03:45:30,480
of angle a, let's use the fact that the measures of the three angles of a triangle add up to 180

1766
03:45:30,480 --> 03:45:42,240
degrees. So that means that 49 degrees plus 90 degrees plus a is equal to 180 degrees. So a is

1767
03:45:42,240 --> 03:45:50,000
equal to 180 degrees minus 90 degrees minus 49 degrees, which works out to 41 degrees.

1768
03:45:51,680 --> 03:45:55,120
To find the length of the side B, we have a couple possible options.

1769
03:45:55,280 --> 03:46:04,400
We could use the fact that tan of 49 degrees, which is opposite over adjacent, is B over 23.

1770
03:46:04,400 --> 03:46:17,840
So B is 23 times tan 49 degrees, which works out to 26.46 units. Alternatively, we could use the fact

1771
03:46:17,840 --> 03:46:26,080
we could use the fact that tan of 41 degrees is 23 over B. Since now, if we're looking at the

1772
03:46:26,080 --> 03:46:32,400
angle here, 23 is our opposite and B is in our adjacent. That's a little bit harder to solve

1773
03:46:32,400 --> 03:46:42,960
algebraically. But we can write B tan 41 degrees equals 23, which means that B is 23 divided by

1774
03:46:42,960 --> 03:46:51,360
tan 41 degrees with a calculator that works out again to 26.46. The reason we want to use tan in

1775
03:46:51,360 --> 03:46:59,520
this problem and not say sine or cosine is because tan of say 49 degrees relates and the unknown side

1776
03:46:59,520 --> 03:47:05,760
that we're looking for B to the side that we know the measure of. If we had used sine instead, we'd

1777
03:47:05,760 --> 03:47:12,320
be saying that sine of 49 is B over C, and we'd have two unknowns, which would make it difficult to

1778
03:47:12,320 --> 03:47:21,520
solve. Next, to find the side length C, we can have a few options. We could use a trig function

1779
03:47:21,520 --> 03:47:30,240
again. For example, we could use the cosine of 49 degrees. That's adjacent over hypotenuse,

1780
03:47:30,960 --> 03:47:47,360
which is 23 over C. Solving for C, we get that C is 23 over cosine 49, which works out to 35.06 units.

1781
03:47:49,120 --> 03:47:54,800
Another option would be to use the Pythagorean theorem to find C. Since we know 23 squared

1782
03:47:55,760 --> 03:48:03,360
plus B squared equals C squared, in other words, that's 23 squared plus 26.46 squared

1783
03:48:03,360 --> 03:48:12,880
equals C squared, which means that C is the square root of that sum, which works out again

1784
03:48:12,880 --> 03:48:20,640
to 35.06. To review, the ideas we used were the sum of the angles

1785
03:48:20,880 --> 03:48:30,400
is equal to 180 degrees. We used facts like tangent of an angle being opposite over adjacent,

1786
03:48:30,400 --> 03:48:35,440
and similar facts about sine and cosine. And we use the Pythagorean theorem.

1787
03:48:36,400 --> 03:48:41,120
This allowed us to find all the angles and side lengths of the triangle, knowing just

1788
03:48:41,120 --> 03:48:47,600
the side length of one side and the angle of one of the non right angles to begin with.

1789
03:48:47,840 --> 03:48:53,680
In this next example, we don't know any of the angles, except for the right angle. But we know

1790
03:48:53,680 --> 03:49:01,360
two of the side lengths. To find the unknown angle theta, we can use the fact that cosine theta

1791
03:49:01,360 --> 03:49:09,520
is adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's 10 over 15. Cosine is a good trig function to use here,

1792
03:49:09,520 --> 03:49:16,480
because this equation relates our unknown angle to our two known sides. So we just have

1793
03:49:16,480 --> 03:49:23,200
one unknown in our equation to solve for. To solve for theta, we just take the cosine inverse

1794
03:49:23,200 --> 03:49:38,880
of 10 15ths, which is 0.8411 radians, or 48.19 degrees. To find the measure of angle fee,

1795
03:49:38,880 --> 03:49:45,360
we could use the fact that sine of fee is 10 over 15, and take sine inverse of 10 15ths,

1796
03:49:46,320 --> 03:49:50,800
but probably a little easier as just to use the fact that these three angles add to 180 degrees.

1797
03:49:52,080 --> 03:50:01,600
That tells us that fee plus 90 plus 48.19 is equal to 180, which means that fee

1798
03:50:03,760 --> 03:50:14,560
is 41.81. Finally, we can find x either using a trig function, or by using the Pythagorean theorem.

1799
03:50:16,160 --> 03:50:23,360
To find it using a trig function, we could write down something like tan of 48.19 degrees

1800
03:50:23,360 --> 03:50:30,240
is x over 10. To find it using Pythagorean theorem, we'd write down 10 squared plus x squared equals

1801
03:50:30,240 --> 03:50:37,360
15 squared. I'll use a Pythagorean theorem and find that x by doing the square root of 15 squared

1802
03:50:37,360 --> 03:50:46,640
minus 10 squared. That gives me an answer of 11.18. Notice that we use many of the same ideas as in

1803
03:50:46,640 --> 03:50:54,320
the previous problem. For example, the fact that the sum of the angles is 180, the Pythagorean theorem,

1804
03:50:55,280 --> 03:51:02,240
and the trig functions like tan, sine and cosine. We also use the inverse trig functions

1805
03:51:03,200 --> 03:51:06,480
to get from an equation like this one to the angle.

1806
03:51:08,240 --> 03:51:12,480
This video showed how it's possible to find the lengths of all the sides of a right triangle

1807
03:51:12,480 --> 03:51:19,280
and the measures of all the angles given partial information. For example, the measure of one angle

1808
03:51:19,280 --> 03:51:22,720
and one side, or from two sides.

1809
03:51:25,440 --> 03:51:31,920
Recall that solving a triangle means finding all the lengths of the sides and all the measures of

1810
03:51:31,920 --> 03:51:39,040
the angles from partial information. The law of cosines is a tool that can help us solve triangles

1811
03:51:39,040 --> 03:51:45,920
that are not necessarily right triangles. Recall that the Pythagorean theorem says that for our

1812
03:51:45,920 --> 03:51:53,760
right triangle, like this one, the length of the hypotenuse is related to the lengths of the sides

1813
03:51:53,760 --> 03:52:01,600
by the formula c squared equals a squared plus b squared. I like to think of the law of cosines

1814
03:52:01,600 --> 03:52:07,120
as a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to triangles that are not necessarily right triangles.

1815
03:52:08,480 --> 03:52:15,440
Loosely speaking, the law of cosines says that c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared

1816
03:52:15,440 --> 03:52:23,360
plus a correction factor, where the correction factor depends on the size of the angle that's

1817
03:52:23,360 --> 03:52:33,120
opposite to side c. For this first triangle, on the left, the angle that's opposite to side c

1818
03:52:33,120 --> 03:52:40,400
is exactly a right angle. So we know that c squared is exactly equal to a squared plus b squared.

1819
03:52:42,080 --> 03:52:49,280
But in this next triangle, the angle opposite to side c prime is a little bit less than a right

1820
03:52:49,280 --> 03:52:56,880
angle. So we expect the side length c prime should be a little bit shorter than the side length c

1821
03:52:56,880 --> 03:53:04,560
in the previous triangle that had the same side lengths a and b for its legs. Therefore, c prime

1822
03:53:04,560 --> 03:53:11,120
squared should be less than a squared plus b squared. Or in other words, c prime squared

1823
03:53:11,120 --> 03:53:18,640
should equal a squared plus b squared minus a little bit. In this third triangle, the angle

1824
03:53:18,640 --> 03:53:25,360
opposite c double prime is a little bigger than 90 degrees. So this side length c double prime

1825
03:53:25,360 --> 03:53:31,520
should be a little bit longer than the side length c in the right triangle with the same size legs.

1826
03:53:33,200 --> 03:53:40,400
So c double prime squared should be bigger than a squared plus b squared. We can write this as c

1827
03:53:40,400 --> 03:53:47,680
double prime squared is equal to a squared plus b squared plus a little bit. The law of cosines

1828
03:53:47,680 --> 03:53:54,240
says precisely what this little correction factor is. It says that for any triangle with sides a,

1829
03:53:54,240 --> 03:54:05,120
b, and c, an angle capital C opposite side c side c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared

1830
03:54:05,120 --> 03:54:12,400
minus two a, b cosine angle C. Let's analyze what happens in this equation

1831
03:54:13,200 --> 03:54:18,400
when angle C is equal to 90 degrees less than 90 degrees and greater than 90 degrees.

1832
03:54:20,720 --> 03:54:30,000
If angle C is equal to 90 degrees, then cosine of angle C is equal to zero. So we have that c

1833
03:54:30,000 --> 03:54:35,760
squared is equal to a squared plus b squared, the ordinary Pythagorean theorem. If on the other

1834
03:54:35,760 --> 03:54:43,280
hand, angle C is less than 90 degrees, then from the unit circle, we know that cosine of c is positive.

1835
03:54:44,240 --> 03:54:53,200
So to a b cosine C is a positive number, and we'll be subtracting a little bit from our a squared

1836
03:54:53,200 --> 03:55:01,200
plus b squared, just like we saw in the picture. Finally, if angle C is bigger than 90 degrees,

1837
03:55:01,200 --> 03:55:08,640
then we can see from the unit circle that cosine of c is negative. So two a, b cosine

1838
03:55:09,360 --> 03:55:15,280
capital C is going to be less than zero. And we're going to be subtracting a negative number,

1839
03:55:15,280 --> 03:55:19,520
which means we're actually adding a little bit, just like we saw in the third picture.

1840
03:55:19,920 --> 03:55:26,320
When labeling a triangle, the convention is to use capital letters for the angles and lowercase

1841
03:55:26,320 --> 03:55:33,600
letters for the side lengths, and to put side a opposite angle a and so on. When we wrote the law

1842
03:55:33,600 --> 03:55:42,000
of cosines on the previous page, we wrote c squared equals a squared plus b squared minus two a b

1843
03:55:42,480 --> 03:55:50,560
cosine angle C. But it doesn't matter which side we call a, which side we call b, and which side

1844
03:55:50,560 --> 03:55:57,280
we call C, all that matters is that this angle is opposite to this side, and between these two sides.

1845
03:55:58,720 --> 03:56:05,120
So we could have just as easily written a squared is equal to b squared plus c squared

1846
03:56:05,200 --> 03:56:14,400
minus two b c cosine a. All we've done is replace C with a, a with b,

1847
03:56:15,680 --> 03:56:23,600
and b with C in our labeling scheme. Or instead, we could put the b squared on the left side and

1848
03:56:23,600 --> 03:56:32,400
write b squared equals a squared plus c squared minus two ac cosine b. We can use whichever of these

1849
03:56:32,480 --> 03:56:38,960
three forms is most convenient for the problem at hand. Let's use the law of cosines to find all

1850
03:56:38,960 --> 03:56:45,840
the side lengths and angles in this triangle. By convention, I'll call the side opposite to angle

1851
03:56:45,840 --> 03:56:58,240
a little a and the side opposite angle b little b. Notice that we know two side lengths and the

1852
03:56:58,240 --> 03:57:08,560
angle between them. So that's an s a s side angle side triangle. If we write down the law of cosines

1853
03:57:08,560 --> 03:57:16,000
with the unknown side, c squared on the left side, then we have all the values for the variables on

1854
03:57:16,000 --> 03:57:23,680
the right side. So let's plug them in. I'll use a calculator in degree mode to find that c squared

1855
03:57:23,680 --> 03:57:35,360
is equal to 44.44. Taking the square root, I get that C is equal to 6.67. Next, I'll use the law

1856
03:57:35,360 --> 03:57:42,960
of cosines to find the angle b. I'll need to use a version of the law of cosines that has cosine b

1857
03:57:42,960 --> 03:57:50,880
right here. That's the version that has little b squared on the left side. And goes b squared

1858
03:57:50,880 --> 03:58:00,000
equals a squared plus c squared minus two ac cosine b. I can plug in values for all my side

1859
03:58:00,000 --> 03:58:09,840
lengths. And now I can solve for cosine b. To do that, I'll subtract eight squared and 6.67 squared

1860
03:58:09,840 --> 03:58:18,400
from both sides. And now I'll divide both sides by negative two times eight times 6.67. Using a

1861
03:58:18,400 --> 03:58:27,840
calculator, this gives me that cosine of b is equal to negative 0.1172. The negative value of

1862
03:58:27,840 --> 03:58:37,120
cosine indicates that my angle b must be greater than 90 degrees, which agrees with a figure. Next,

1863
03:58:37,120 --> 03:58:46,720
I can take cosine inverse of both sides to get that b is equal to cosine inverse negative 0.1172,

1864
03:58:46,720 --> 03:58:55,840
which works out to 96.73 degrees. The last thing I need to do is solve for angle a. I could use the

1865
03:58:55,840 --> 03:59:02,720
law of cosines again, and work out angle a just like I worked out angle b here. But a simpler

1866
03:59:02,720 --> 03:59:09,280
thing to do is to use the fact that the sum of the three angles equals 180 degrees. In other words,

1867
03:59:09,840 --> 03:59:22,000
a plus 37 degrees plus 96.73 degrees equals 180 degrees. So a is going to be 180 minus 37 minus

1868
03:59:22,000 --> 03:59:34,560
96.73, which works out to 46.27 degrees. In the previous example, we were given two sides and the

1869
03:59:34,560 --> 03:59:42,800
angle between them. In this example, instead, we're given three side lengths. So I'll call this an s s s

1870
03:59:42,800 --> 03:59:51,040
side side side triangle. We need to find all three angles. Although there are a lot of computations

1871
03:59:51,040 --> 03:59:58,720
involved, the ideas are the same as in the previous problem. To find angle capital C, we need the form

1872
03:59:58,720 --> 04:00:05,920
of the law of cosines that has cosine of c on the right side, and little c on the left side,

1873
04:00:06,960 --> 04:00:14,480
to find angle a, we need the form of the law of cosines that has cosine a on the right side and

1874
04:00:14,480 --> 04:00:21,360
little a on the left side. And to find angle d, we need the form of the law of cosines that has

1875
04:00:21,360 --> 04:00:29,520
cosine of b on the right side, and little b squared on the left side. For each of

1876
04:00:29,520 --> 04:00:35,520
these three equations, I'll plug in the side lengths, solve for the cosines, and

1877
04:00:35,520 --> 04:00:42,880
use inverse cosine to find my angles. Notice that my three angles, 60 degrees,

1878
04:00:43,280 --> 04:00:53,520
32.20 degrees, and 87.79 degrees add up to just almost 180 degrees. The difference is just due

1879
04:00:53,520 --> 04:00:59,600
to a round off error. In fact, I could have saved myself some work by just finding the

1880
04:00:59,600 --> 04:01:05,600
measure of angle C, and the measure of angle A, and then subtracting them from 180 degrees

1881
04:01:05,600 --> 04:01:11,200
to get the measure of angle B. In this video, we stated the law of cosines,

1882
04:01:12,160 --> 04:01:17,680
and used it to solve some triangles. The law of cosines can be thought of as the

1883
04:01:17,680 --> 04:01:23,440
Pythagorean theorem with a correction factor to account for triangles that aren't right triangles.

1884
04:01:25,440 --> 04:01:30,320
Recall that solving a right triangle means finding all the lengths of the sides and all

1885
04:01:30,320 --> 04:01:36,240
the measures of the angles from partial information. The law of cosines is a tool that can help us

1886
04:01:36,240 --> 04:01:42,720
solve triangles that are not necessarily right triangles. Recall that the Pythagorean theorem

1887
04:01:42,720 --> 04:01:52,160
says that for a right triangle, like this one, C squared is equal to A squared plus B squared.

1888
04:01:53,920 --> 04:01:58,560
I like to think of the law of cosines as a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem

1889
04:01:58,560 --> 04:02:01,440
to triangles that are not necessarily right triangles.

1890
04:02:02,400 --> 04:02:09,680
Loosely speaking, the law of cosines says that C squared is equal to A squared plus B squared

1891
04:02:09,680 --> 04:02:16,720
plus a correction factor, where the correction factor depends on the size of the angle that's

1892
04:02:16,720 --> 04:02:24,800
opposite size C. In this first triangle on the left, the angle opposite to side C is a right

1893
04:02:24,800 --> 04:02:31,760
angle. So we know that C squared is equal to exactly A squared plus B squared.

1894
04:02:33,360 --> 04:02:40,640
But in the next triangle, the angle opposite to side C prime is a little bit less than a

1895
04:02:40,640 --> 04:02:47,920
right angle. So this side C prime should be a little shorter than A squared plus B squared.

1896
04:02:48,880 --> 04:02:56,160
I'll write C prime squared is equal to A squared plus B squared minus a bit.

1897
04:02:59,280 --> 04:03:06,000
In this third triangle, since the angle opposite to side C double prime is a little bit bigger

1898
04:03:06,000 --> 04:03:11,440
than 90 degrees, this side length should be a little bit bigger than A squared plus B squared.

1899
04:03:12,080 --> 04:03:15,680
So I'll write it as A squared plus B squared plus a little bit.

1900
04:03:17,040 --> 04:03:23,120
The law of cosines says exactly what this little correction factor is. It says that for any triangle

1901
04:03:23,120 --> 04:03:31,680
with sides A, B, and C, an angle capital C opposite to side C, C squared is equal to A squared plus B

1902
04:03:31,680 --> 04:03:41,520
squared minus two AB cosine of angle C. Notice that if the angle C is less than 90 degrees,

1903
04:03:42,400 --> 04:03:45,520
cosine of C is going to be a positive number.

1904
04:03:48,160 --> 04:03:54,960
And so we'll be subtracting a positive quantity, just like we saw in the picture above.

1905
04:03:55,920 --> 04:04:04,080
If, however, angle C is bigger than 90 degrees, then cosine of C is negative. So by subtracting

1906
04:04:04,880 --> 04:04:11,200
to AB cosine C, we're actually adding a little bit, and we get a longer side, as in this picture.

1907
04:04:13,120 --> 04:04:18,560
When labeling a triangle, the convention is to use lowercase letters for the side lengths

1908
04:04:18,560 --> 04:04:24,080
and uppercase letters for the angles, and to put angle A opposite side A and so on.

1909
04:04:25,440 --> 04:04:31,680
When we wrote the law of cosines on the previous page, we wrote C squared equals A squared plus

1910
04:04:31,680 --> 04:04:41,040
B squared minus two AB cosine C. But it doesn't matter which side we call A, which side we call

1911
04:04:41,040 --> 04:04:47,680
B, and which side we call C. All that matters is that this angle is opposite to this side

1912
04:04:47,680 --> 04:04:55,040
and between these two sides. So we could have just as easily written A squared equals

1913
04:04:55,040 --> 04:05:06,400
B squared plus C squared minus two BC cosine A, or B squared equals A squared plus C squared

1914
04:05:06,400 --> 04:05:15,200
minus two AC cosine B. We can use whichever of these three forms is most convenient for the

1915
04:05:15,200 --> 04:05:21,840
problem at hand. Let's use the law of cosines to find the side lengths and angles of this triangle.

1916
04:05:22,800 --> 04:05:31,120
By convention, I'm going to call the side opposite angle B side little B, and the side

1917
04:05:31,120 --> 04:05:39,360
opposite angle A side little A. Since we know two side lengths and the angle between them,

1918
04:05:39,920 --> 04:05:46,320
we have all the information on the right side of the law of cosines. So I'll plug that in

1919
04:05:48,560 --> 04:05:57,760
and use a calculator in degree mode to find that C squared equals 44.44. Taking the square root,

1920
04:05:57,760 --> 04:06:06,800
I get that C equals 6.67. Next, I'll use the law of cosines to find the angle B.

1921
04:06:07,760 --> 04:06:14,400
I'll need to use a version of the law of cosines that mentions cosine of angle B here. So it'll need

1922
04:06:14,400 --> 04:06:21,520
to mention side length little B here. So that'll be the form B squared on the left.

1923
04:06:22,320 --> 04:06:31,840
I'll get A squared plus C squared minus two AC cosine B on the right. I'll plug in values

1924
04:06:31,840 --> 04:06:40,240
for all my side lengths. And now I can solve for cosine B by subtracting 8 squared and 6.67

1925
04:06:40,240 --> 04:06:48,480
squared from both sides, and now dividing both sides by negative 2 times 8 times 6.67. Using a

1926
04:06:48,480 --> 04:06:59,280
calculator, this gives me that cosine of B is equal to negative 0.1172. The negative value

1927
04:06:59,280 --> 04:07:05,360
of cosine indicates that my angle B must be greater than 90 degrees, which agrees with the picture.

1928
04:07:07,040 --> 04:07:16,480
Next, I can take cosine inverse of both sides to get that B is equal to cosine inverse of negative

1929
04:07:16,480 --> 04:07:27,440
0.1172, which works out to 96.73 degrees. The last thing I have to do is solve for angle A.

1930
04:07:28,400 --> 04:07:33,760
I could use law of cosines again and work it out just like I did here for angle B.

1931
04:07:34,720 --> 04:07:40,560
But a simpler method is to just use the fact that the sum of the three angles is 180 degrees.

1932
04:07:42,000 --> 04:07:56,080
So A must be 180 degrees minus 37 degrees minus 96.73 degrees. This works out to 46.27 degrees.

1933
04:07:57,920 --> 04:08:02,080
In the previous example, we were given two sides and the angle between them.

1934
04:08:02,960 --> 04:08:08,560
In this angle, we're given instead three side lengths, and we need to find all three angles.

1935
04:08:09,760 --> 04:08:14,640
Although there are a lot of computations involved, the ideas are the same as in the previous problem.

1936
04:08:15,440 --> 04:08:23,280
To find angle C, we need the form of the law of cosines that has cosine of C on the right side.

1937
04:08:23,280 --> 04:08:29,200
To find capital B, we need to use the form of the law of cosines that has cosine of B

1938
04:08:29,200 --> 04:08:34,800
on the right side and little b on the left side. So it'll be b squared equals a squared plus c

1939
04:08:34,800 --> 04:08:43,360
squared minus 2ac cosine b. And to find angle A, we need little a squared on the left side

1940
04:08:44,880 --> 04:08:52,560
so that we'll get cosine of angle A on the right side. For each of these three equations,

1941
04:08:52,560 --> 04:08:59,520
I'll plug in the side lengths, solve for the cosine of the angle, and use inverse cosine to

1942
04:08:59,520 --> 04:09:09,760
find my angles. Notice that my three angles, 60 degrees, 87.79 degrees, and 32.20 degrees,

1943
04:09:09,760 --> 04:09:16,560
add up to almost exactly 180 degrees. It's just a tiny bit off due to round off error. In fact,

1944
04:09:16,560 --> 04:09:21,520
I could have saved myself some work by just finding the measure of angle C and the measure of angle

1945
04:09:21,520 --> 04:09:27,040
B, for example, and then subtracting their sum from 180 degrees to get angle A.

1946
04:09:28,640 --> 04:09:36,240
In this video, we stated the law of cosines and used it to solve some triangles. The law of cosines

1947
04:09:36,240 --> 04:09:41,760
can be thought of as the Pythagorean theorem with an adjustment factor to account for triangles

1948
04:09:41,760 --> 04:09:48,000
that aren't right triangles. The law of signs is a tool that can be used to solve triangles that

1949
04:09:48,000 --> 04:09:54,240
are not necessarily right triangles. It's especially useful when we know two angles and one side.

1950
04:09:55,520 --> 04:10:00,640
And it can also be used in the situation where we know two sides and an angle that's not between

1951
04:10:00,640 --> 04:10:09,360
them. The law of signs says that for a triangle with angles A, B, and C opposite to sides,

1952
04:10:10,160 --> 04:10:19,440
locates A, B, and C respectively, the sign of angle A divided by the length of side A

1953
04:10:19,440 --> 04:10:26,800
is equal to the sign of B over B, which is also equal to the sign of C over C.

1954
04:10:28,160 --> 04:10:34,640
Notice that we're taking the sign of the three angles and dividing by the three opposite side

1955
04:10:34,640 --> 04:10:45,360
lengths. Suppose we know that angle A is 55 degrees, angle C is 67 degrees, and side B is 20 degrees.

1956
04:10:46,640 --> 04:10:51,520
We want to solve the triangle, that is, find the lengths of the other sides and the measure

1957
04:10:51,520 --> 04:10:58,560
of the third angle. Since we know two angles already, we can find the third angle by subtracting

1958
04:10:58,560 --> 04:11:07,520
from 180 degrees. So angle B is 58 degrees. Now I can use the law of signs to find my

1959
04:11:07,520 --> 04:11:18,160
remaining side lengths. To find side A, I'll use the fact that sign of angle A over side

1960
04:11:18,160 --> 04:11:25,760
length A is equal to sign of angle B over side length B. Since I already know three of these

1961
04:11:25,760 --> 04:11:33,360
quantities, angle A, angle B, and side length B, I can plug in and solve for the unknown

1962
04:11:34,400 --> 04:11:42,320
side length A. To solve, I'll multiply both sides by A and then multiply both sides by 20 over the

1963
04:11:42,320 --> 04:11:54,640
sign of 58 degrees. That gives me that A is equal to 20 sine 55 over sine 58, which works out to

1964
04:11:54,640 --> 04:12:04,400
19.32. Please pause the video and use the same method to find side length C. This time, we need to

1965
04:12:04,400 --> 04:12:14,720
involve sine of C and side length C in our equation. And we could use either the B's or the A's,

1966
04:12:14,720 --> 04:12:23,440
since they're both known for the other side. I'll plug in values as I can and solve for C. C works out

1967
04:12:23,440 --> 04:12:34,720
to 21.71. In the previous example, we used the law of signs to find the side lengths of a triangle,

1968
04:12:34,720 --> 04:12:41,040
because we already knew the angles. In this next example, we're given some side lengths,

1969
04:12:41,840 --> 04:12:47,760
and we're going to need to solve for some angles. This can be tricky, because when we write down the

1970
04:12:47,760 --> 04:12:56,560
law of signs and start solving for an angle, we first solve for sine of the angle. But there can be

1971
04:12:56,560 --> 04:13:04,640
two plausible angles that both have the same sign. For example, if sine of the angle happens to be

1972
04:13:04,640 --> 04:13:17,440
one half, then the angle could be either 30 degrees or 150 degrees. In some cases,

1973
04:13:17,440 --> 04:13:24,000
this can lead to two possible triangles that both have the conditions given. When this happens,

1974
04:13:24,000 --> 04:13:29,600
and there are two possible solutions, I call this an ambiguous case. With that warning,

1975
04:13:29,600 --> 04:13:36,000
let's figure out the details of this example. Plugging in my given information into the law

1976
04:13:36,000 --> 04:13:42,320
of signs, I'll focus on this portion of the equation where there's only one unknown to solve for.

1977
04:13:43,360 --> 04:13:50,080
First, I'll solve for sine of A, which is 8 times sine 40 degrees over 7,

1978
04:13:50,960 --> 04:14:01,920
which works out to 0.7346. From the unit circle, I can see that there'll be two possible angles

1979
04:14:01,920 --> 04:14:09,440
with this sine, one in the first quadrant and one in the second quadrant. If I take sine inverse

1980
04:14:09,440 --> 04:14:20,240
of both sides of my equation, I get the solution in the first quadrant, which is 47.27 degrees.

1981
04:14:21,680 --> 04:14:29,840
Since this angle right here is 47.27 degrees, so is this angle here. And so the angle

1982
04:14:29,840 --> 04:14:36,000
that I want in the second quadrant, I can get by going 180 minus 47.27 degrees,

1983
04:14:36,880 --> 04:14:45,840
which works out to 132.73. One of these possible angles, it's an acute angle,

1984
04:14:45,840 --> 04:14:51,120
the other one at obtuse angle, but both are possible configurations. I'll sketch the possible

1985
04:14:51,120 --> 04:15:00,480
triangles. In both triangles, side length A and B are the same, and angle B is the same,

1986
04:15:00,480 --> 04:15:05,600
but everything else is different. We can continue to solve for the other angle

1987
04:15:05,600 --> 04:15:10,800
and side in each case. In the left side, I'll call this case one.

1988
04:15:12,720 --> 04:15:20,560
We can solve for angle C by taking 180 degrees minus angle B minus angle A.

1989
04:15:21,440 --> 04:15:31,760
That gives us an angle just over 90 degrees, 92.73 degrees. Now we can use either the law of

1990
04:15:31,760 --> 04:15:37,360
sines or the law of cosines to find the final side length C. I'll use the law of sines again.

1991
04:15:38,480 --> 04:15:43,280
So I'll plug in the value of angle C into this part of my equation

1992
04:15:44,240 --> 04:15:55,200
and solve for C to get C equals sine 92.73 degrees times seven over sine 40 degrees,

1993
04:15:56,320 --> 04:16:05,120
which works out to 10.88. For the right-hand triangle, we can carry out the same steps

1994
04:16:05,200 --> 04:16:12,560
to get angle C and now plug into the law of sines to get side length C.

1995
04:16:14,240 --> 04:16:20,560
We finish solving for the two possible triangles with these given side lengths and angle.

1996
04:16:22,160 --> 04:16:27,680
In this video, we used the law of sines to solve a triangle in two different situations. In the

1997
04:16:27,680 --> 04:16:38,160
first situation, we had two angles and the side between them. So that's an ASA triangle for angle

1998
04:16:38,160 --> 04:16:45,040
side angle. In that situation, we ended up just using the law of sines to solve for side lengths

1999
04:16:45,040 --> 04:16:51,440
and there was no ambiguity. In the second situation, we had a triangle where we knew two

2000
04:16:51,440 --> 04:16:58,240
side lengths and an angle that was not between them. So I'll call that SSA and in that case,

2001
04:16:58,240 --> 04:17:06,800
we did find two possible triangles that would work. The SSA situation doesn't always give two

2002
04:17:06,800 --> 04:17:13,040
possible triangles. Sometimes when you go through the two cases and figure out all the other angles

2003
04:17:13,040 --> 04:17:18,240
and side lengths, you'll get an impossible situation and the angle, for example, that's

2004
04:17:18,240 --> 04:17:24,080
has to be negative because the other two angles add up to more than 180 degrees.

2005
04:17:25,680 --> 04:17:29,920
But you do have to be on the lookout for two possible triangles when you're solving

2006
04:17:29,920 --> 04:17:37,280
a triangle with the SSA information given. This video describes some of the features of a parabola.

2007
04:17:38,080 --> 04:17:45,440
It's vertex, focus and directrix. I want to start by finding the equation of all points

2008
04:17:45,520 --> 04:17:54,080
that are equidistant the same distance from a point zero P on the y axis and the horizontal line

2009
04:17:54,080 --> 04:17:59,520
y equals negative P. I'm assuming here that P is positive for starters.

2010
04:18:00,960 --> 04:18:06,160
Certainly the origin will be among those points as it has a distance of P from the point

2011
04:18:06,800 --> 04:18:13,840
and P from the line. But the other points on the x axis will be closer to the line

2012
04:18:13,840 --> 04:18:18,560
than they are to the point. So if I want the set of points that are the same distance from the

2013
04:18:18,560 --> 04:18:25,680
point in the line, that's going to be a curve that curves upwards, something like this. So for

2014
04:18:25,680 --> 04:18:32,000
example, a point out here will be the same distance from the point as it is from the line.

2015
04:18:33,280 --> 04:18:39,360
So our intuition is suggesting that this set of points should be the shape of a parabola.

2016
04:18:39,360 --> 04:18:46,800
Let's confirm this with some algebra. If we take an arbitrary point with coordinates x y,

2017
04:18:47,760 --> 04:18:56,080
its distance from the point zero P is given by the distance formula x minus zero squared plus

2018
04:18:56,080 --> 04:19:05,280
y minus p squared. Its distance from the line y equals negative P is just given by its difference

2019
04:19:05,280 --> 04:19:15,120
in y coordinates. So that's going to be y minus negative P or y plus P.

2020
04:19:16,720 --> 04:19:19,120
Let me set these two quantities equal to each other.

2021
04:19:20,720 --> 04:19:27,680
And simplify, I can square both sides. To get on the left x minus zero squared with the same

2022
04:19:27,680 --> 04:19:35,760
thing as x squared plus y minus p squared equals y plus p squared. Now I'll distribute out that gives

2023
04:19:35,760 --> 04:19:48,800
me x squared plus y squared minus 2 p y plus p squared equals y squared plus 2 p y plus p squared.

2024
04:19:49,040 --> 04:19:58,480
The p squareds cancel out as do the y squareds. And I'm left with x squared equals 4 p y after

2025
04:19:58,480 --> 04:20:07,760
moving this negative 2 p y to the other side. I could also write this as y equals one over 4 p x

2026
04:20:07,760 --> 04:20:14,960
squared. And you might recognize this as the standard parabola y equals x squared, transformed by

2027
04:20:14,960 --> 04:20:21,360
vertically stretched stretching or shrinking it by this factor of one over 4 p. You might recall that

2028
04:20:21,360 --> 04:20:29,680
this lowest point of the parabola is called the vertex. This point here is called its focus. And

2029
04:20:29,680 --> 04:20:38,800
the line here is called the directrix. Notice that the number P in this equation represents the

2030
04:20:38,800 --> 04:20:45,680
distance between the vertex and the focus and also represents the distance between the vertex and

2031
04:20:45,680 --> 04:20:52,640
the directrix line. For this reason, if you're interested in the focus and the vertex, this form

2032
04:20:52,640 --> 04:20:59,680
of the equation might be more useful than the equivalent form, something like y equals ax squared,

2033
04:20:59,680 --> 04:21:06,880
where the that distance p is more hidden. Now so far, we've just considered the case when p is greater

2034
04:21:07,520 --> 04:21:13,520
than zero. Let's look for a moment at what happens when p is less than zero. Then when we draw the point

2035
04:21:13,520 --> 04:21:23,040
zero p is going to be below the x axis. And the directrix y equals negative p is going to be above

2036
04:21:23,040 --> 04:21:28,000
the x axis because we're taking the negative of a negative number makes it a positive y value.

2037
04:21:29,040 --> 04:21:31,360
Our parabola will also be upside down.

2038
04:21:31,360 --> 04:21:40,560
All the algebra works out the same, it's just in our equation, this coefficient of y will now be a

2039
04:21:40,560 --> 04:21:46,080
negative number instead of a positive one. Or if we write it in this other form, which might be more

2040
04:21:46,080 --> 04:21:51,280
familiar, our coefficient of x squared will be negative instead of positive, which signifies that

2041
04:21:51,280 --> 04:21:58,320
the parabola is pointing down. Since p is now a negative number, if we want to talk about distances,

2042
04:21:58,400 --> 04:22:06,640
we should write absolute value of p instead of p. Next, let's turn things sideways by looking at the

2043
04:22:06,640 --> 04:22:14,320
equation for all points equidistance from point p zero, on the x axis, here we're assuming for

2044
04:22:14,320 --> 04:22:20,560
starters that p is bigger than zero, and a vertical line at x equals negative p.

2045
04:22:22,320 --> 04:22:26,080
Our intuition suggests that this should be a parabola pointing sideways.

2046
04:22:26,320 --> 04:22:30,880
And we can work out the same algebra steps to get an equation for it.

2047
04:22:32,160 --> 04:22:37,280
Starting with an arbitrary point x, y, the distance from the point

2048
04:22:38,640 --> 04:22:46,160
p zero is going to be given by x minus p squared plus y minus zero squared. The distance from the

2049
04:22:46,160 --> 04:22:54,720
line x equals negative p is going to be given by the difference in x coordinates. So that's going

2050
04:22:54,720 --> 04:23:03,920
to be x minus negative p, or just x plus p. I'll set these two distances equal to each other,

2051
04:23:04,720 --> 04:23:12,240
square both sides like before, and simplify. This gives me the equation y squared equals four px,

2052
04:23:13,440 --> 04:23:21,200
which I could also rewrite as x equals one over four p y squared, or x equals a y squared,

2053
04:23:21,200 --> 04:23:27,520
where my a corresponds to my one over four p. Once again, if p is negative,

2054
04:23:28,720 --> 04:23:33,280
then my parabola will be pointing the opposite direction. But my equation will still be the

2055
04:23:33,280 --> 04:23:38,560
same, it'll just have a negative coefficient of x instead of a positive one, the negative number

2056
04:23:38,560 --> 04:23:47,440
being hidden inside this variable p. As before, the absolute value of p gives me the distance

2057
04:23:47,440 --> 04:23:54,240
between the vertex and the focus, and also gives me the distance between the vertex and the

2058
04:23:54,240 --> 04:24:01,440
directrix. Now let's find the equation for parabola with a vertex at some arbitrary point hk

2059
04:24:01,440 --> 04:24:10,080
instead of the origin, assuming that the parabola opens up or down. If the parabola had its vertex

2060
04:24:10,080 --> 04:24:16,240
at the origin, we know it would be given by the equation x squared equals four p y, or I could

2061
04:24:16,240 --> 04:24:24,160
rewrite that as y equals one over four p x squared. So this parabola should just be shifted

2062
04:24:25,200 --> 04:24:32,640
to the right by h and up by k. From transformations of functions, we know we can accomplish this

2063
04:24:32,640 --> 04:24:44,320
by sticking a x minus h on the inside, and putting a plus k on the outside. In other words,

2064
04:24:44,320 --> 04:24:54,480
we have y minus k equals one over four p times x minus h squared, or we can write this as x minus

2065
04:24:54,480 --> 04:25:05,280
h squared equals four p times y minus k. So this is the original with the vertex at the origin. And

2066
04:25:05,280 --> 04:25:16,560
here is the transformed by shifting right and up to have a vertex at hk. Notice that the equations

2067
04:25:16,560 --> 04:25:24,560
are exactly the same. It's just you stuck in a minus h and a minus k near the x and near the y.

2068
04:25:26,080 --> 04:25:32,480
This transform parabola will have its focus, a distance of p up from the vertex. So that's

2069
04:25:32,480 --> 04:25:41,680
going to be the point h k plus p. And it's going to have its directrix at a distance p down from

2070
04:25:41,680 --> 04:25:51,200
the vertex. So that's going to be the line y equals k minus p. Everything's the same for this other

2071
04:25:51,200 --> 04:25:57,760
parabola pointing downwards, we just have p is negative in that case. The same story holds for

2072
04:25:57,760 --> 04:26:05,680
the parabola is pointing right and left. The original equation, y squared equals four p x

2073
04:26:06,400 --> 04:26:14,560
gets transformed when we ship the parabola over into y minus k squared equals four p x minus h.

2074
04:26:15,760 --> 04:26:23,200
This time, the vertex is a distance p to the left or right of my vertex. So here it would be

2075
04:26:24,000 --> 04:26:32,320
h plus p k. And the directrix would be shifted over by p also from the vertex. So this would be

2076
04:26:32,320 --> 04:26:41,120
the vertical line x equals h minus p. It works the same way when the parabola is opening left

2077
04:26:41,120 --> 04:26:47,920
instead of right. It's just in this case p is negative. Let's use this information to find the

2078
04:26:47,920 --> 04:26:54,880
equation of a parabola with vertex at 24 and focus at negative 14. I'll start with a quick sketch,

2079
04:26:55,440 --> 04:27:01,040
which will help me see how the parabola is lined up. So here's the vertex at 24.

2080
04:27:02,800 --> 04:27:07,280
And the focus is at negative 14. So here's the focus here.

2081
04:27:09,840 --> 04:27:15,520
Now, since the parabola always hugs its focus, that means that this parabola must be pointing

2082
04:27:15,520 --> 04:27:22,560
left and look something like this. The directrix is going to be on the other side of the parabola,

2083
04:27:22,560 --> 04:27:28,240
the same distance as the distance between the vertex and the focus. Since this distance is

2084
04:27:28,880 --> 04:27:36,320
a distance of three to minus negative one is three, the directrix must be three units

2085
04:27:36,320 --> 04:27:43,360
over here to the right. And so that would be the line x equals five.

2086
04:27:45,600 --> 04:27:49,200
Since my parabola is open to the left, I know I need to use the form of the equation

2087
04:27:50,080 --> 04:27:59,200
y minus k squared equals four p x minus h, where h k is the vertex. So that's 24.

2088
04:27:59,840 --> 04:28:06,000
I also know that p is going to be negative. And since the absolute value of p represents

2089
04:28:06,000 --> 04:28:12,160
the distance between the vertex and the focus, I know that p must be negative three.

2090
04:28:12,960 --> 04:28:20,080
So filling on all these numbers, I get y minus four squared equals four times negative three

2091
04:28:20,080 --> 04:28:28,320
times x minus two. I'll simplify that to y minus four squared equals negative 12 x minus two.

2092
04:28:30,080 --> 04:28:34,000
In this video, we looked at special forms of the equation for a parabola.

2093
04:28:34,000 --> 04:28:43,920
The forms y minus k squared equals four p x minus h and x minus h squared equals four p y minus k.

2094
04:28:44,960 --> 04:28:52,400
In these equations, h k represents the vertex. And p's absolute value gives the distance

2095
04:28:52,400 --> 04:29:04,640
between the vertex and the focus and between the vertex and the directrix.

2096
04:29:06,560 --> 04:29:15,680
Parabolas in this form are opening right if p is bigger than zero and left if p is less than zero.

2097
04:29:15,680 --> 04:29:23,200
And parabolas in this form are opening up if p is bigger than zero and down if p is less than zero.

2098
04:29:24,400 --> 04:29:31,440
This video is about ellipses. Recall that a circle can be defined as a set of points

2099
04:29:31,440 --> 04:29:38,800
whose distance from a fixed point is a constant. Any ellipse can be defined as a set of points

2100
04:29:39,440 --> 04:29:44,000
such that the sum of the distances

2101
04:29:47,120 --> 04:29:48,800
from two fixed points

2102
04:29:51,120 --> 04:29:57,760
is a constant. The two fixed points are called focuses or foci.

2103
04:30:00,000 --> 04:30:05,920
And the sum of the distances to the two foci is the total length of the string,

2104
04:30:05,920 --> 04:30:11,040
which is held constant as I draw the ellipse. Let's examine the features of an ellipse in more

2105
04:30:11,040 --> 04:30:20,960
detail. In these pictures, the two black dots are the focuses or foci. The red line segment

2106
04:30:20,960 --> 04:30:26,000
that cuts through the middle of the ellipse in the long direction and passes through the foci

2107
04:30:26,000 --> 04:30:31,360
is called the major axis. The line segment that cuts through the middle of the ellipse

2108
04:30:31,360 --> 04:30:37,920
in the shorter direction is called the minor axis. And the two points at the tips of the ellipse,

2109
04:30:37,920 --> 04:30:41,760
where the major axis actually touches the ellipse, are called the vertices.

2110
04:30:43,920 --> 04:30:49,040
An ellipse could be elongated in any direction, but we'll only consider ellipses that are elongated

2111
04:30:49,040 --> 04:30:55,280
either in the horizontal direction, or the vertical direction. Let's find the equation of an ellipse

2112
04:30:56,240 --> 04:31:06,960
whose foci are at negative C, zero, and C zero, and whose vertices are at negative a zero,

2113
04:31:07,920 --> 04:31:13,520
and a zero. This will be an ellipse that's elongated in the horizontal direction.

2114
04:31:14,880 --> 04:31:22,240
For any point x y on the ellipse, the sum of the distance from x y to the first focus,

2115
04:31:22,880 --> 04:31:28,880
plus its distance to the second focus has to be some constant. And in fact,

2116
04:31:28,880 --> 04:31:35,920
it turns out that constant has to equal to a, I'll show you why. If you look at this point

2117
04:31:35,920 --> 04:31:43,200
right here on the far right tip of the ellipse, its distance from the first focus is going to be

2118
04:31:43,920 --> 04:31:52,720
two C plus a minus C. And its distance from the second focus is just going to be a minus C.

2119
04:31:53,440 --> 04:32:00,960
If you add up C plus C plus a minus C plus a minus C, you get exactly two a.

2120
04:32:02,400 --> 04:32:08,160
So let me write out my formulas for distances. The distance from a point x y to the first focus,

2121
04:32:08,240 --> 04:32:15,840
the point negative C zero is going to be the square root of x minus negative C squared

2122
04:32:15,840 --> 04:32:22,320
plus y minus zero squared. And the distance from x y to the second focus, the point C zero,

2123
04:32:22,960 --> 04:32:29,360
is going to be the square root of x minus C squared plus y minus zero squared. That

2124
04:32:29,360 --> 04:32:36,400
sum needs to add up to two a. After a fair amount of algebra, this simplifies to the expression

2125
04:32:36,800 --> 04:32:45,680
a squared minus C squared, x squared plus a squared y squared equals a squared times a squared

2126
04:32:45,680 --> 04:32:53,760
minus C squared. If we let b squared equal a squared minus C squared, then we can rewrite this

2127
04:32:53,760 --> 04:33:01,520
as b squared x squared plus a squared y squared equals a squared b squared. And dividing both sides

2128
04:33:01,520 --> 04:33:07,760
by a squared b squared, this gives us the form of the equation for the ellipse x squared over a

2129
04:33:07,760 --> 04:33:16,640
squared plus y squared over b squared equals one. Since we got b squared as a squared minus C squared,

2130
04:33:16,640 --> 04:33:24,960
it follows that b is less than a. In fact, b is half the length of the minor axis. In other words,

2131
04:33:24,960 --> 04:33:31,760
this point right here is the point zero b. And this point is the point zero negative b.

2132
04:33:33,200 --> 04:33:39,840
To see why this is true, let's draw these two right triangles. The sum of the side lengths

2133
04:33:39,840 --> 04:33:46,080
that I've drawn has to be the total length of the string. So that equals two a, which means each of

2134
04:33:46,080 --> 04:33:53,600
these side lengths must be a. Now the base of this triangle is C. So by the Pythagorean theorem,

2135
04:33:54,320 --> 04:34:00,880
this height squared must be a squared minus C squared. Since b squared is defined as a squared

2136
04:34:00,880 --> 04:34:08,720
minus C squared, this height must be b. To summarize, for a number a bigger than b,

2137
04:34:08,720 --> 04:34:15,120
the equation x squared over a squared plus y squared over b squared equals one represents

2138
04:34:15,120 --> 04:34:18,880
an ellipse that's elongated

2139
04:34:21,280 --> 04:34:30,320
in the horizontal direction, whose major axis terminates in the points minus a zero and a zero,

2140
04:34:31,040 --> 04:34:38,000
and whose minor axis terminates in the points zero b and zero minus b.

2141
04:34:38,160 --> 04:34:47,120
It's foci are at the points negative C zero and C zero. And the relationship between a b and c is

2142
04:34:47,120 --> 04:34:55,440
that b squared is a squared minus c squared. Equivalently, if we add c squared to both sides

2143
04:34:55,440 --> 04:35:01,520
and subtract b squared from both sides, we can write c squared equals a squared minus b squared.

2144
04:35:02,320 --> 04:35:07,200
The way I remember this is that the biggest of the three numbers a b and c is definitely going to

2145
04:35:07,840 --> 04:35:13,600
be a, since a is half the length of the major axis, which is bigger than half the length of

2146
04:35:13,600 --> 04:35:19,360
the minor axis, and definitely bigger than the length between the origin and one of the focuses.

2147
04:35:20,720 --> 04:35:25,200
Since a is the biggest, and we have a Pythagorean theorem relationship between a b and c,

2148
04:35:26,000 --> 04:35:30,720
the equation must be b squared plus c squared equals a squared, which can be rearranged to

2149
04:35:30,800 --> 04:35:37,680
either of these two equations. Now, what happens instead, if we have a bigger than b still,

2150
04:35:37,680 --> 04:35:42,240
but this time we're dividing y squared by the bigger number squared, and x squared by the

2151
04:35:42,240 --> 04:35:47,600
smaller number squared. Well, this basically reverses the roles of x and y in my equation.

2152
04:35:48,720 --> 04:35:54,560
And so we end up with the major axis on the y axis stretching between the points, zero a

2153
04:35:55,520 --> 04:36:01,600
and zero negative a, whereas the minor axis is going to be along the x axis, going in between

2154
04:36:02,160 --> 04:36:08,720
negative b zero and b zero, and the foci are going to be here on the y axis again.

2155
04:36:09,680 --> 04:36:14,080
So in this case, my ellipse is elongated in the vertical direction.

2156
04:36:16,480 --> 04:36:21,040
Our previous ellipses were centered at the origin. What if the ellipse is centered instead

2157
04:36:21,040 --> 04:36:27,680
at an arbitrary point hk? Well, then we need to shift everything over by h in the horizontal

2158
04:36:27,680 --> 04:36:33,520
direction and k in the vertical direction. So instead of the equation x squared over a squared

2159
04:36:33,520 --> 04:36:40,960
plus y squared over b squared equals one, we're going to have to have x minus h squared over a

2160
04:36:40,960 --> 04:36:49,120
squared plus y minus k squared over b squared equals one, where a is bigger than b. That's

2161
04:36:49,120 --> 04:36:54,800
for an ellipse elongated in the horizontal direction. If we want an ellipse elongated in the

2162
04:36:54,800 --> 04:37:01,280
vertical direction, we'll still take a bigger than b, but we'll reverse the roles of x and y. So this

2163
04:37:01,280 --> 04:37:07,360
becomes x squared over b squared plus y squared over a squared equals one for the center at the

2164
04:37:07,360 --> 04:37:15,600
origin. And to shift it over, we get x minus h squared over b squared plus y minus k squared

2165
04:37:15,600 --> 04:37:22,960
over a squared equals one. I'll draw some pictures below. With some thought, we can label key

2166
04:37:22,960 --> 04:37:29,600
points. For example, this vertex must be shifted over by an amount a since a is half the length of

2167
04:37:29,600 --> 04:37:38,800
the major axis. So it'll have coordinates h plus a k, whereas this vertex will be h minus a k. This

2168
04:37:38,800 --> 04:37:52,240
point up here should be h k plus b, and this one h k minus b. The foci are at h plus c k, and h minus

2169
04:37:52,240 --> 04:37:59,120
c k. We can label the points on the ellipse that's elongated vertically. Similarly,

2170
04:38:01,280 --> 04:38:05,280
let's write the equation of the ellipse drawn below, and then we'll find its foci.

2171
04:38:06,160 --> 04:38:12,960
Its major axis is in the vertical direction, right here. Its top vertex is at the point

2172
04:38:13,680 --> 04:38:23,120
for three, as bottom vertex is at the point for negative nine. Its center is halfway between

2173
04:38:23,120 --> 04:38:30,800
its two vertices, which is right here at the point for negative three. Finally, I can read off the

2174
04:38:30,800 --> 04:38:39,520
points at the end of the minor axis. So this one is at nine negative three, and this one is at negative

2175
04:38:39,520 --> 04:38:45,200
one negative three. Since my ellipse is elongated vertically, I know I have an equation of the

2176
04:38:45,200 --> 04:38:53,520
form x minus h squared over b squared plus y minus k squared over a squared equals one with a bigger

2177
04:38:53,520 --> 04:39:02,640
than b. My center is my point h k, and that's equal to four, negative three. A is half the

2178
04:39:02,640 --> 04:39:09,040
length of the major axis. So that's the vertical distance between this point and this point,

2179
04:39:09,040 --> 04:39:15,200
I can just take the difference of y coordinates and see that a is equal to six. B is half the

2180
04:39:15,200 --> 04:39:20,640
length of the minor axis. So looking at the difference in x coordinates of these two points,

2181
04:39:20,720 --> 04:39:28,800
I see that B is equal to five. Throwing that all into my equation, I get that x minus four squared

2182
04:39:28,800 --> 04:39:37,360
over five squared plus y plus three squared over six squared equals one. The foci are going to be

2183
04:39:37,360 --> 04:39:44,720
somewhere along the major axis, somewhere above and below the center. To figure out how far they

2184
04:39:44,720 --> 04:39:51,520
are, I need to use the fact that c squared is equal to a squared minus b squared. So in this case,

2185
04:39:51,520 --> 04:39:57,760
c squared is six squared minus five squared, which is 11, which means that c is a square root of 11,

2186
04:39:57,760 --> 04:40:05,360
which is a little bit bigger than three. So the two foci are distance of square root of 11 above

2187
04:40:05,360 --> 04:40:09,040
and below the center. And so they'll have coordinates

2188
04:40:11,440 --> 04:40:18,880
of four, negative three plus the square root of 11. And four, negative three minus the square

2189
04:40:18,880 --> 04:40:26,960
root of 11. This video detailed the anatomy of ellipse, including its major axis, its minor axis,

2190
04:40:27,920 --> 04:40:35,280
its vertices, and its foci. This video is about hyperbola.

2191
04:40:37,920 --> 04:40:47,600
You might recall that any ellipse is the set of points x, y, such that the sum of the distances

2192
04:40:47,600 --> 04:40:56,800
between x, y, and two fixed points called the foci is a constant. Well, a hyperbola is a set of

2193
04:40:56,800 --> 04:41:10,480
points x, y, such that the difference of the distances between x, y, and each of two fixed

2194
04:41:10,480 --> 04:41:21,120
points, called the foci, is a constant. In this picture on the left, the two blue lines

2195
04:41:21,840 --> 04:41:28,400
are the two branches of the hyperbola. The two red points are the focuses or foci.

2196
04:41:29,760 --> 04:41:37,440
So for a point x, y on the hyperbola, if I look at the distance from x, y to one focus,

2197
04:41:38,080 --> 04:41:44,880
and the distance from x, y to the other focus, the difference of those two distances

2198
04:41:44,880 --> 04:41:51,280
will be the same, no matter which point x, y on the hyperbola that I choose.

2199
04:41:52,720 --> 04:41:55,600
If I draw a line between the two foci,

2200
04:41:57,840 --> 04:42:04,000
that line is called the transverse axis. In this left picture, we have a vertical

2201
04:42:04,000 --> 04:42:10,960
transverse axis. And the hyperbola itself reminds me of a person lying down horizontally.

2202
04:42:11,840 --> 04:42:18,240
Now in the right picture, our transverse axis between the two foci is horizontal.

2203
04:42:19,280 --> 04:42:24,080
And the blue hyperbola itself kind of reminds me of a person standing up vertically.

2204
04:42:25,360 --> 04:42:30,960
It's possible for a hyperbola to be oriented other ways, besides horizontally and vertically,

2205
04:42:30,960 --> 04:42:35,280
but we'll only consider horizontal and vertical orientations in this video.

2206
04:42:36,480 --> 04:42:42,160
If you look at where the transverse axis intersects the blue branches of the hyperbola,

2207
04:42:42,800 --> 04:42:50,240
you'll find these two points. Those points are called the vertices. Notice that the vertices

2208
04:42:50,240 --> 04:42:56,000
are the two points on the two branches that are closest to one another. The point halfway

2209
04:42:56,000 --> 04:43:02,160
between the two vertices, it's also halfway between the two foci, is called the center of the hyperbola.

2210
04:43:03,920 --> 04:43:10,000
The two black dotted lines that I've drawn that form an x are not actually part of the hyperbola.

2211
04:43:10,720 --> 04:43:16,160
They're called the asymptotes. And you can think of them as guidelines for drawing the hyperbola,

2212
04:43:16,160 --> 04:43:20,240
because the hyperbola gets closer and closer to these asymptotes, but doesn't cross them.

2213
04:43:20,800 --> 04:43:22,640
We'll talk more about the asymptotes later.

2214
04:43:23,920 --> 04:43:29,920
Let's find the equation of a hyperbola with foci at negative c zero and c zero,

2215
04:43:29,920 --> 04:43:36,160
and vertices at negative a zero and a zero. This hyperbola will have its center at the origin.

2216
04:43:37,280 --> 04:43:43,360
From the distance definition of hyperbola, we know that if we have a point x y on the hyperbola,

2217
04:43:44,160 --> 04:43:47,840
then if we take the distance from that point to the first focus,

2218
04:43:48,560 --> 04:43:53,360
and the distance to the second focus, and subtract them, we should get a constant.

2219
04:43:54,640 --> 04:43:59,520
We're always taking the positive difference here. So if we're on the right branch, we'll take the

2220
04:43:59,520 --> 04:44:05,520
distance to the left focus minus the shorter distance to the right focus. And if we happen to be

2221
04:44:05,520 --> 04:44:13,280
on the left branch, then we would take the longer distance to the right focus minus the

2222
04:44:13,280 --> 04:44:17,600
shorter distance to the left focus. When we do the differences that way, we should always get

2223
04:44:17,600 --> 04:44:24,560
the same number. And in fact, that difference should equal to a, I'll show you why. The reason is,

2224
04:44:24,560 --> 04:44:31,120
if I take my point to be this vertex here, then its distance to this focus is exactly

2225
04:44:31,840 --> 04:44:40,720
c minus a because c is bigger than a. And this distance to that focus is going to be, well,

2226
04:44:40,720 --> 04:44:48,160
let's see, this is a, this is a, and this is c minus a. So that different distance will be a plus

2227
04:44:48,160 --> 04:44:56,800
a plus c minus a. Now I'm going to do the difference a plus a plus c minus a minus c minus a.

2228
04:44:57,040 --> 04:45:09,440
That simplifies to a plus c minus c plus a, which is to a. Now I'll focus on a point on the right

2229
04:45:09,440 --> 04:45:14,560
branch. And I'll actually write a formula for its distance to this point. That's the distance

2230
04:45:14,560 --> 04:45:23,360
formula. It's going to be x minus negative c squared plus y minus zero squared. That's the

2231
04:45:23,360 --> 04:45:29,360
longer difference distance. Now I subtract the shorter distance, which is the distance

2232
04:45:29,360 --> 04:45:35,760
to this focus. And there the distance formula gives me x minus c squared plus y minus zero

2233
04:45:35,760 --> 04:45:42,560
squared. That should always equal to a for any point on that right branch. I'll clean up the

2234
04:45:42,560 --> 04:45:48,400
inside of the square roots a little bit. After that, a chunk of algebra, which I won't do here

2235
04:45:48,400 --> 04:45:57,520
here, allows you to simplify this equation to c squared minus a squared times x squared minus a

2236
04:45:57,520 --> 04:46:04,080
squared y squared equals a squared times c squared minus a squared. Since this expression, c squared

2237
04:46:04,080 --> 04:46:09,200
minus a squared is appearing a couple times here, I'm going to give it a new name. I'm going to let

2238
04:46:09,200 --> 04:46:15,440
b squared b c squared minus a squared. Now I can rewrite my equation as b squared x squared minus

2239
04:46:15,520 --> 04:46:21,680
a squared y squared equals a squared b squared. And dividing both sides by a squared b squared

2240
04:46:22,800 --> 04:46:29,440
yields the equation x squared over a squared minus y squared over b squared equals one.

2241
04:46:32,000 --> 04:46:38,080
In this equation, notice that a represents the distance from the center to a vertex.

2242
04:46:38,320 --> 04:46:44,480
The quantity c is not directly in this equation, but it's related to a and b

2243
04:46:45,360 --> 04:46:51,360
by this equation, which can also be rewritten as c squared equals a squared plus b squared,

2244
04:46:51,360 --> 04:46:58,320
or if you prefer a squared equals c squared minus b squared. I remember this one. I remember that c,

2245
04:46:58,320 --> 04:47:03,440
which is the distance from the center to the focus, is the largest of the three quantities a b and c.

2246
04:47:04,400 --> 04:47:08,960
So you might be wondering, well, what does b represent? Well, I'm going to draw a box

2247
04:47:09,520 --> 04:47:16,800
whose center is at the center of my hyperbola that stretches out in a from either direction left

2248
04:47:16,800 --> 04:47:25,280
right and stretches up by b in either direction up and down. It turns out that the corners of

2249
04:47:25,280 --> 04:47:33,840
such a box will be exactly on these two asymptote lines. In other words, the slope of this asymptote,

2250
04:47:34,400 --> 04:47:42,160
its rise over its run is b over a. And for this asymptote that's slipping downwards,

2251
04:47:42,160 --> 04:47:49,280
its rise over its run is negative b over a. So I can actually write the equations of the asymptotes

2252
04:47:50,000 --> 04:48:02,640
for this hyperbola centered at the origin as y equals b over a x and y equals negative b over a x.

2253
04:48:03,680 --> 04:48:08,880
We did all this work for a standing up hyperbola with its transverse axis oriented horizontally.

2254
04:48:10,240 --> 04:48:14,880
Let me rearrange things and we'll see what changes if the hyperbola is oriented the other way.

2255
04:48:15,840 --> 04:48:19,120
In this case, where we have a vertical transverse axis,

2256
04:48:19,840 --> 04:48:25,600
the roles of x and y are completely switched. So our equation, which we could derive the same way

2257
04:48:26,400 --> 04:48:32,160
becomes y squared over a squared minus x squared over b squared equals one.

2258
04:48:32,960 --> 04:48:38,400
We still have the same formulas c squared equals a squared plus b squared. And the two related

2259
04:48:38,400 --> 04:48:43,680
formulas b squared equals c squared minus a squared and a squared equals c squared minus b squared.

2260
04:48:43,680 --> 04:48:50,480
A is still the distance from the center to the vertex. And C still represents the distance

2261
04:48:50,480 --> 04:48:58,640
from the center to a focus. Now our box will extend up and down by a units and left and right by b

2262
04:48:58,640 --> 04:49:07,680
units. So this time, the slope of the asymptote, the rise over the run is going to be a over b

2263
04:49:08,640 --> 04:49:14,960
for the line that's sloped up, and negative a over b for the line that's sloped down.

2264
04:49:15,840 --> 04:49:21,520
This means our asymptotes, which go through the center at the origin will be given by the

2265
04:49:21,520 --> 04:49:29,360
equations y equals a over b x and y equals negative a over b x. I want to point out that in this

2266
04:49:29,360 --> 04:49:36,720
notation, a is going with x in one form of the equation and y in the other form of the equation,

2267
04:49:36,800 --> 04:49:42,560
but it always goes with the positive term, the term that's added instead of subtracted, whereas b

2268
04:49:43,440 --> 04:49:50,000
goes with the negative term, the term that's subtracted. Which term is positive, the x squared

2269
04:49:50,000 --> 04:49:56,000
or the y squared determines the orientation of the hyperbola this way or that way.

2270
04:49:57,200 --> 04:50:01,600
So far, we've been considering only hyperbola centered at the origin, and we had these two

2271
04:50:01,600 --> 04:50:10,640
equations for them. If we center at an arbitrary point, hk instead, we just subtract h from the x

2272
04:50:10,640 --> 04:50:21,600
term and subtract k from the y term. The graphs are shifted over by h and up by k. And to get to

2273
04:50:21,600 --> 04:50:34,480
the vertices, we just start at the center and go left and right by a or up and down by a, depending

2274
04:50:34,480 --> 04:50:44,880
on which way the hyperbola is oriented. So the vertices here are at h plus a k and h minus a k,

2275
04:50:45,600 --> 04:50:53,280
whereas over here, the vertices are at hk plus a and hk minus a.

2276
04:50:55,120 --> 04:51:03,760
To get to the focuses, we have to go over by C, or up and down by C,

2277
04:51:05,120 --> 04:51:11,200
where c squared equals a squared plus b squared. Finally, the asymptotes

2278
04:51:11,200 --> 04:51:18,160
still have the same slopes as before. But this time, they have to go through the center, which is at

2279
04:51:18,160 --> 04:51:26,320
hk instead of zero zero, their equations are going to be given by y minus k equals b over a x minus h.

2280
04:51:26,960 --> 04:51:35,920
And y minus k is negative b over a x minus h. Or with the other orientation, the analogous thing,

2281
04:51:35,920 --> 04:51:44,640
y minus k equals a over b x minus h, and y minus k equals a over b negative a over b x minus h.

2282
04:51:46,240 --> 04:51:51,520
We've done all the abstract theory. Let's do one example with numbers. If we're given this

2283
04:51:51,520 --> 04:52:00,640
hyperbola, we can read off its center as six negative three. Since the x term is positive,

2284
04:52:00,720 --> 04:52:05,120
I'm going to let a be the square root of four, and b will be the square root of 25.

2285
04:52:06,800 --> 04:52:12,160
Since the x term is positive, and the y term is negative, the hyperbola is going to be oriented

2286
04:52:12,160 --> 04:52:23,280
standing up like this, with a horizontal transverse axis. The distance from the center to each vertex

2287
04:52:23,280 --> 04:52:31,040
is given by the number a, which is two. So the left vertex will have coordinates for negative

2288
04:52:31,040 --> 04:52:39,200
three, and the right vertex will have coordinates, eight, negative three. To find the foci, I need

2289
04:52:39,200 --> 04:52:48,080
to figure out c squared, which is a squared plus b squared, or four plus 2529. So c is the square

2290
04:52:48,080 --> 04:52:55,840
root of 29. I'll sketch ballpark position of my foci here. And the coordinates are going to be

2291
04:52:56,960 --> 04:53:04,480
at, let's see, the center is six, so six minus square root of 29, same y coordinate of negative

2292
04:53:04,480 --> 04:53:12,960
three, and six plus square root of 29, negative three. Finally, the asymptotes will form an x

2293
04:53:12,960 --> 04:53:23,920
going through the center with slope given by b over a, which is five halves, and negative b over a,

2294
04:53:23,920 --> 04:53:31,920
negative five halves. The equations for those lines will be y plus three, coming from the center,

2295
04:53:31,920 --> 04:53:39,120
equals five halves, x minus six, and y plus three equals negative five halves, x minus six.

2296
04:53:40,080 --> 04:53:44,080
This gives a decent rough sketch of the hyperbola. If I want to be a little more accurate, I could

2297
04:53:44,080 --> 04:53:51,120
also plot some points by plugging in values of x and solving for y or vice versa. In this video,

2298
04:53:51,120 --> 04:53:58,480
we gave two equations for hyperbolas, which one you use depends on how the hyperbola is oriented.

2299
04:53:59,600 --> 04:54:06,320
A has to do with the distance between the center and the vertex, the number c, which can be figured

2300
04:54:06,560 --> 04:54:11,760
out from the equation c squared equals a squared plus b squared, is going to represent the distance

2301
04:54:11,760 --> 04:54:22,000
from the center to the focus. And b and a together help determine the slope of the asymptotes.

2302
04:54:23,360 --> 04:54:29,440
This video introduces the idea of polar coordinates. Polar coordinates give an alternative way of

2303
04:54:29,440 --> 04:54:36,160
describing the location of points on the plane. Instead of describing a point in terms of its x

2304
04:54:36,160 --> 04:54:42,720
and y coordinates, those are the Cartesian coordinates of the point. When using polar

2305
04:54:42,720 --> 04:54:49,040
coordinates, we instead describe the point in terms of a radius r and an angle theta.

2306
04:54:49,920 --> 04:54:58,160
r is the distance of the point from the origin, and theta is the angle that radius line makes

2307
04:54:58,160 --> 04:55:08,960
with the positive x axis. Let's plot these points given in polar coordinates. So the eight here

2308
04:55:08,960 --> 04:55:15,120
is the value of the radius, and the negative two thirds pi is the value of the angle theta.

2309
04:55:16,000 --> 04:55:21,120
The negative angle means that I need to go clockwise from the positive x axis,

2310
04:55:21,120 --> 04:55:24,560
instead of counterclockwise like I normally would for a positive angle.

2311
04:55:24,560 --> 04:55:35,120
So here, a negative two thirds pi means that I need to go to this line right here. And the eight

2312
04:55:35,120 --> 04:55:40,240
of for the radius means I need to go eight lines out from the origin. So my point should be around

2313
04:55:40,240 --> 04:55:50,160
right here. The next point has a radius of five and an angle of three pi. The angle of positive

2314
04:55:50,160 --> 04:55:56,960
three pi means that I go counterclockwise starting at the positive x axis. Here, I've gone around by

2315
04:55:56,960 --> 04:56:04,160
two pi. And here, I've got an extra pi to make three pi. Now the radius of five means I need to go

2316
04:56:04,160 --> 04:56:12,080
five units out from the origin. So that puts me about right here. Notice that I could have also

2317
04:56:12,080 --> 04:56:18,480
labeled this point with the polar coordinates of five pi. There's more than one way to assign

2318
04:56:18,480 --> 04:56:27,440
polar coordinates to a point. The next point has an angle of pi over four, and a radius of negative

2319
04:56:27,440 --> 04:56:34,000
12. The negative radius means that I need to jump to the other side of the circle before I plot the

2320
04:56:34,000 --> 04:56:42,240
point. In other words, instead of plotting the point at an angle of pi over four and a radius of 12,

2321
04:56:43,200 --> 04:56:49,360
which would be about right here, I go to the opposite side of the circle and plot it at the same

2322
04:56:49,360 --> 04:56:56,640
distance from the origin, but 180 degrees or pi radians around the circle over here.

2323
04:56:58,960 --> 04:57:06,800
Now I could have also labeled this point using a positive radius of 12, and using an angle of pi

2324
04:57:07,040 --> 04:57:16,320
over four plus pi, or five pi over four. And in general, a point with polar coordinates of negative

2325
04:57:16,320 --> 04:57:25,520
r theta means the same point as the point with polar coordinates are theta plus pi. Adding pi

2326
04:57:25,520 --> 04:57:34,560
just makes us jump around to the opposite side of the circle. To convert between polar and Cartesian

2327
04:57:34,560 --> 04:57:43,600
coordinates, it's handy to use the following equations. First, x is equal to r cosine theta,

2328
04:57:44,400 --> 04:57:55,760
y is equal to r sine theta, r squared is equal to x squared plus y squared, which means that r

2329
04:57:55,760 --> 04:58:03,520
is plus or minus the square root of x squared plus y squared. And tangent theta is equal to y

2330
04:58:03,520 --> 04:58:12,880
divided by x. Let's see where these equations come from. If we draw a point with coordinates x, y,

2331
04:58:13,600 --> 04:58:21,760
and draw lines to make a right triangle, the height of that triangle is y, the length of the base

2332
04:58:22,320 --> 04:58:30,080
is x, and the hypotenuse has length r theta is the measure of this interior angle.

2333
04:58:30,080 --> 04:58:40,960
From trig, we know that cosine theta is equal to adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's x over r,

2334
04:58:41,520 --> 04:58:51,200
which means that x is equal to r cosine theta. Similarly, sine theta is opposite over hypotenuse,

2335
04:58:51,200 --> 04:58:59,920
that's y over r, which means that y is equal to r sine theta. That gives us the first two equations.

2336
04:59:00,080 --> 04:59:09,040
The Pythagorean theorem tells us that x squared plus y squared is equal to r squared, and that

2337
04:59:09,040 --> 04:59:20,080
gives us the third equation. Finally, tangent theta is opposite over adjacent. So that's y over x,

2338
04:59:20,080 --> 04:59:27,920
which is the fourth equation. To convert five negative pi over six from polar to Cartesian

2339
04:59:27,920 --> 04:59:36,400
coordinates, we just use the fact that x equals r cosine theta, and y equals r sine theta. So in

2340
04:59:36,400 --> 04:59:45,600
this case, x is equal to five times cosine of negative pi over six, that's five times square root

2341
04:59:45,600 --> 04:59:55,120
of three over two, and y is equal to five sine negative pi over six. So that's equal to negative

2342
04:59:55,120 --> 05:00:02,560
five halves. To convert negative one negative one from Cartesian to polar coordinates,

2343
05:00:03,840 --> 05:00:09,520
we know that negative one and negative one are x and y values. So we need to use the fact that

2344
05:00:09,520 --> 05:00:19,280
r squared is x squared plus y squared, that is, r squared is negative one squared plus negative

2345
05:00:19,280 --> 05:00:30,240
one squared, or two. Also, tangent theta is y over x. So that's negative one over negative one,

2346
05:00:30,240 --> 05:00:37,760
or one. Now there's several values of r and theta that satisfy these equations. r could be

2347
05:00:37,760 --> 05:00:46,400
squared of two, or negative the square root of two, and theta could be pi over four, or five pi

2348
05:00:46,400 --> 05:00:55,600
over four, or we could add multiples of two pi to either of these answers. But not all combinations

2349
05:00:55,600 --> 05:01:02,880
of r and theta get us to the right point. The point with Cartesian coordinates, negative one,

2350
05:01:02,880 --> 05:01:11,040
negative one, lies in the third quadrant. But if we use a theta value of say pi over four,

2351
05:01:11,040 --> 05:01:16,720
and an r value of square root of two, that would get us to the first quadrant. So instead,

2352
05:01:17,360 --> 05:01:26,400
we need to use the polar coordinates of square root of two, and five pi over four, or if we prefer

2353
05:01:27,120 --> 05:01:34,000
negative square root of two, and pi over four. We could also add any multiple of two pi to either

2354
05:01:34,000 --> 05:01:39,360
of these values of theta, and get yet another way of representing the point in polar coordinates.

2355
05:01:41,920 --> 05:01:47,920
This video talked about polar coordinates, and converting in between Cartesian coordinates

2356
05:01:47,920 --> 05:01:51,440
and polar coordinates using some familiar equations from trig.

2357
05:01:55,360 --> 05:02:02,000
This video introduces the idea of parametric equations. Instead of describing a curve as y

2358
05:02:02,000 --> 05:02:09,200
equals f of x, we can describe the x coordinates and y coordinates separately in terms of a third

2359
05:02:09,200 --> 05:02:20,640
variable, t, usually thought of as time. So we can write x as a function of t, and y as a separate

2360
05:02:20,640 --> 05:02:28,080
function of t. This is especially useful as a way to describe curves that don't satisfy the vertical

2361
05:02:28,080 --> 05:02:34,240
line test, and therefore can't be described traditionally as functions of y in terms of x.

2362
05:02:34,640 --> 05:02:42,720
A Cartesian equation for a curve is an equation in terms of x and y only. Parametric equations

2363
05:02:43,280 --> 05:02:49,920
for a curve give both x and y as functions of a third variable, usually t. The third variable

2364
05:02:49,920 --> 05:02:56,880
is called the parameter. As our first example, let's graph the parametric equations given here

2365
05:02:57,440 --> 05:03:06,560
on an x y coordinate axis. We'll do this by finding x and y coordinates that correspond to the same

2366
05:03:06,560 --> 05:03:15,520
value of t. For example, when t is negative two, you can calculate that x by plugging in negative

2367
05:03:15,520 --> 05:03:21,760
two for t gives you five, and y when you plug in negative two for t gives you eight.

2368
05:03:21,920 --> 05:03:27,280
Please pause the video for a moment and fill in some additional values of x and y for some additional

2369
05:03:27,280 --> 05:03:35,200
values of t. Your chart should look like this. And when we plot the x y pairs and connect the dots,

2370
05:03:35,200 --> 05:03:42,720
we get something like this. Notice that this point over here corresponds to a t value of negative two,

2371
05:03:42,720 --> 05:03:51,120
and this point over here corresponds to the t value of two. So if we think of t as time,

2372
05:03:51,200 --> 05:03:59,840
we're traversing the curve in this direction. To find a Cartesian equation for this curve,

2373
05:03:59,840 --> 05:04:06,320
we need to eliminate the variable t from these equations. One way to do this is to solve for t

2374
05:04:06,320 --> 05:04:15,440
in one equation, say the first equation. So two t is equal to one minus x, which means that t

2375
05:04:16,160 --> 05:04:24,240
is one half minus x over two, then we can plug that expression for t into the second equation

2376
05:04:24,240 --> 05:04:33,760
and get y equals one half minus x over two squared plus four, which simplifies to the quadratic

2377
05:04:33,760 --> 05:04:45,440
equation y equals one fourth x squared minus one half x plus 17 fourths. Let's try some more

2378
05:04:45,440 --> 05:04:53,360
examples. A table of values for the first example helps us draw the familiar graph of a circle

2379
05:04:54,000 --> 05:05:02,160
of radius one. This should come as no surprise, since the equations x equals cosine t and y equals

2380
05:05:02,160 --> 05:05:09,360
sine t are familiar from trig as a way of describing the x and y coordinates of a point on the unit

2381
05:05:09,360 --> 05:05:18,720
circle. Notice that when t equals zero, our curve lies on the positive x axis. And as t increases

2382
05:05:18,720 --> 05:05:24,560
from zero to two pi, we traverse the curve once in the counterclockwise direction.

2383
05:05:24,800 --> 05:05:32,960
A Cartesian equation for this unit circle is given by the equation x squared plus y squared

2384
05:05:32,960 --> 05:05:41,280
equals one. This follows from the trig identity cosine squared t plus sine squared t equals one

2385
05:05:41,280 --> 05:05:49,680
by substituting in x for cosine t and y for sine t. Please pause the video for a moment

2386
05:05:49,680 --> 05:05:54,480
to graph the second curve and rewrite it as a Cartesian equation.

2387
05:05:56,160 --> 05:06:02,880
A table of values should help you see that the graph is again a unit circle. But this time,

2388
05:06:03,520 --> 05:06:10,640
as t increases from zero to two pi, we actually traverse the circle twice in the clockwise

2389
05:06:10,640 --> 05:06:18,160
direction. I'll draw this with a double arrow moving clockwise. The Cartesian equation for this

2390
05:06:18,160 --> 05:06:26,560
graph is still x squared plus y squared equals one. And so we found two different

2391
05:06:26,560 --> 05:06:34,160
parameterizations for the same graph on the x y axis. Let's take a look at the third equation.

2392
05:06:35,440 --> 05:06:40,880
There's no interval of value specified for t here. So let's just assume that t can be any real number.

2393
05:06:41,280 --> 05:06:48,240
Now as t ranges from negative infinity to infinity, our y values, which are given by cosine t,

2394
05:06:48,240 --> 05:06:56,800
oscillate between one and negative one. Our x values are always the square of our y values.

2395
05:06:56,800 --> 05:07:05,680
So the graph of this curve has to lie on the graph of x equals y squared, which is a sideways

2396
05:07:05,760 --> 05:07:12,240
parabola. But our parametrically defined curve doesn't cover this whole parabola.

2397
05:07:12,800 --> 05:07:19,120
Remember that y is given by cosine of t. So y can only range between negative one and one.

2398
05:07:19,120 --> 05:07:23,280
And so we're only getting the portion of the parabola that I shade in here.

2399
05:07:24,960 --> 05:07:32,080
As t varies from say zero to pi, I traverse this parabola one time. And then as t goes from pi to

2400
05:07:32,080 --> 05:07:39,120
two pi, I go back again in the other direction. And as t continues to increase, I traverse this

2401
05:07:39,120 --> 05:07:46,000
parabola infinitely many times. The Cartesian equation for this curve is the equation x equals

2402
05:07:46,000 --> 05:07:51,840
y squared with the restriction that y is between negative one and one.

2403
05:07:55,280 --> 05:07:59,760
We've seen several examples where we went from parametric equations to Cartesian equations.

2404
05:08:00,400 --> 05:08:05,520
Now let's start with a Cartesian equation and rewrite it as a parametric equation.

2405
05:08:06,800 --> 05:08:13,040
In this example, y is already given as a function of x. So an easy way to parameterize this curve

2406
05:08:13,040 --> 05:08:23,760
is to just let x equal t, and then y is equal to the square root of t squared minus t, substituting

2407
05:08:23,760 --> 05:08:32,160
in t for x. The domain restriction in terms of x just translates into a restriction in terms of t.

2408
05:08:34,480 --> 05:08:39,280
I call this the copycat parameterization. Since we've successfully introduced the

2409
05:08:39,280 --> 05:08:47,200
new variable t, but t just copies whatever x does. In the second example, we could try setting x

2410
05:08:47,200 --> 05:08:57,200
equal to t, then we get 25 t squared plus 36 y squared is equal to 900. And solving for y,

2411
05:08:57,200 --> 05:09:04,400
we'd have y squared equals 900 minus 25 t squared over 36.

2412
05:09:06,080 --> 05:09:15,120
So y is plus or minus the square root of this quantity. This is a very awkward looking expression.

2413
05:09:15,120 --> 05:09:19,120
In fact, why is not even a function of t here because of the plus and minus signs.

2414
05:09:20,160 --> 05:09:22,880
So let's look for a better way to parametrize this curve.

2415
05:09:24,880 --> 05:09:30,160
Because of the x squared and the y squared, this equation is a good candidate for parametrizing

2416
05:09:30,160 --> 05:09:37,520
using sine and cosine. In fact, if we divide both sides of the equation by 900, we get

2417
05:09:38,160 --> 05:09:45,760
25 x squared over 900 plus 36 y squared over 900 is equal to one,

2418
05:09:47,120 --> 05:09:53,920
which simplifies to x squared over 36 plus y squared over 25 is equal to one.

2419
05:09:55,200 --> 05:10:02,640
If I rewrite this as x over six squared plus y over five squared equals one,

2420
05:10:03,600 --> 05:10:12,160
then I can set x over six equal to cosine of t and y over five equal to sine of t.

2421
05:10:12,160 --> 05:10:20,320
And I can see that for any value of t, x over six and y over five will satisfy this equation

2422
05:10:20,320 --> 05:10:27,840
simply because cosine squared plus sine squared equals one. This gives me the parameterization

2423
05:10:28,560 --> 05:10:38,560
x equals six cosine of t, y equals five sine of t, which is a handy way to describe an ellipse.

2424
05:10:41,840 --> 05:10:49,280
As a final example, let's describe a general circle of radius r and center hk.

2425
05:10:50,160 --> 05:10:59,120
For any point x y on the circle, we know that the distance from that point x y to the center

2426
05:10:59,120 --> 05:11:08,480
of the circle is equal to r. So using the distance formula, we know that the square root of x minus

2427
05:11:08,720 --> 05:11:18,160
x minus h squared plus y minus k squared has to equal r. Squaring both sides,

2428
05:11:18,160 --> 05:11:24,560
this gives us the equation for the circle in Cartesian coordinates. So for example,

2429
05:11:25,280 --> 05:11:34,240
if our circle has radius five and has center at the point negative three, 17, then its equation

2430
05:11:34,240 --> 05:11:43,840
would be x minus negative three, that's x plus three squared plus y minus 17 squared is equal to 25.

2431
05:11:45,520 --> 05:11:52,400
One way to find the equation of a general circle in parametric equations is to start with the

2432
05:11:52,400 --> 05:12:00,560
unit circle and work our way up. We know that the unit circle with radius one centered at the origin

2433
05:12:00,640 --> 05:12:06,720
is given by the equation x equals cosine t and y equals sine t.

2434
05:12:09,120 --> 05:12:13,760
If we want a circle of radius r centered around the origin instead,

2435
05:12:15,120 --> 05:12:21,760
then we need to expand everything by a factor of r. So we multiply our x and y coordinates by r.

2436
05:12:22,720 --> 05:12:32,560
If we now want the center to be at hk instead of at the origin, then we need to add h to all our x

2437
05:12:32,560 --> 05:12:40,400
coordinates and add k to all our y coordinates. This gives us the general equation for a circle

2438
05:12:41,120 --> 05:12:48,080
in parametric equations to match the Cartesian equation above. We can write our same example

2439
05:12:48,720 --> 05:13:02,560
circle in parametric equations as x equals five cosine t minus three, y equals five sine t plus 17.

2440
05:13:05,120 --> 05:13:10,400
In this video, we translated back and forth in between Cartesian equations

2441
05:13:10,960 --> 05:13:17,120
and parametric equations with a special emphasis on the equations for circles.

2442
05:13:18,240 --> 05:13:27,360
This video is about the difference quotient and the average rate of change.

2443
05:13:29,120 --> 05:13:32,800
These are topics that are related to the concept of derivative in calculus.

2444
05:13:34,160 --> 05:13:38,720
For a function y equals f of x, like the function who's graphed right here,

2445
05:13:39,440 --> 05:13:46,880
a secant line is a line that stretches between two points on the graph of the function.

2446
05:13:49,040 --> 05:13:56,880
I'm going to label this x value as a and this x value as b. So this point here on the graph is

2447
05:13:56,880 --> 05:14:06,160
going to have an x value of a and a y value given by f of a. The second point will have x value b

2448
05:14:06,160 --> 05:14:15,040
and y value f of b. Now the average rate of change for a function on the interval from a to b

2449
05:14:15,760 --> 05:14:21,680
can be defined as the slope of the secant line

2450
05:14:25,120 --> 05:14:26,480
between the two points,

2451
05:14:28,480 --> 05:14:40,080
a f of a and b f of b. In symbols, that slope m is the rise over the run or the change in y

2452
05:14:40,080 --> 05:14:49,120
over the change in x, which is the difference in y coordinates f of b minus f of a over the

2453
05:14:49,120 --> 05:14:54,560
difference in x coordinates b minus a. So this is the average rate of change.

2454
05:14:55,760 --> 05:15:01,920
To put this in context, if for example, f of x represents the height of a tree

2455
05:15:02,080 --> 05:15:12,160
and x represents time in years, then f of b minus f of a represents a difference in height or the

2456
05:15:12,160 --> 05:15:19,840
amount the tree grows. And b minus a represents a difference in in years. So a time period. So this

2457
05:15:19,840 --> 05:15:24,880
average rate of change is the amount the tree grows in a certain time period. For example, if it grows

2458
05:15:25,520 --> 05:15:32,800
10 inches in two years, that would be 10 inches per two years or five inches per year would be its

2459
05:15:32,800 --> 05:15:38,560
average rate of change, its average rate of growth. Let's compute the average rate of change for the

2460
05:15:38,560 --> 05:15:45,680
function f of x equals square root of x on the interval for one to four. So the average rate of

2461
05:15:45,680 --> 05:15:55,680
change is f of four minus f of one over four minus one. Well, f of four is the square root of four

2462
05:15:56,400 --> 05:16:03,520
of one square root of one. So that's going to be two minus one over three or one third.

2463
05:16:05,360 --> 05:16:13,200
Instead of calling these two locations on the x axis, a and b, this time I'm going to call the

2464
05:16:13,200 --> 05:16:23,360
first location just x and the second location x plus h. The idea is that h represents the horizontal

2465
05:16:23,360 --> 05:16:31,840
distance between these two locations on the x axis. In this notation, if I want to label this

2466
05:16:31,840 --> 05:16:39,520
point on the graph of y equals f of x, it'll have an x coordinate of x and a y coordinate of f of x.

2467
05:16:39,520 --> 05:16:47,200
The second point will have an x coordinate of x plus h and a y coordinate of f of x plus h.

2468
05:16:48,640 --> 05:16:55,680
A difference quotient is simply the average rate of change using this x x plus h notation.

2469
05:16:56,800 --> 05:17:00,560
So a difference quotient represents the average rate of change

2470
05:17:00,960 --> 05:17:14,560
of a function f of x on the interval from x to x plus h. Equivalently, the difference quotient

2471
05:17:14,560 --> 05:17:23,200
represents the slope of the secant line for the graph of y equals f of x between the points

2472
05:17:23,520 --> 05:17:34,640
with coordinates x f of x and x plus h f of x plus h. Let's work out a formula for the difference

2473
05:17:34,640 --> 05:17:40,960
quotient. Remember that the formula for the average rate of change could be written as f of b

2474
05:17:41,520 --> 05:17:48,880
minus f of a over b minus a, where a and b are the two locations on the x axis.

2475
05:17:48,880 --> 05:17:56,800
But now I'm calling instead of a I'm using x instead of b I'm using x plus h. So I can rewrite

2476
05:17:56,800 --> 05:18:05,760
this average rate of change as f of x plus h minus f of x over x plus h minus x.

2477
05:18:07,120 --> 05:18:14,960
That simplifies a little bit on the denominator. Because x plus h minus x, I can cancel the x's

2478
05:18:15,520 --> 05:18:22,320
and I get the difference quotient formula f of x plus h minus f of x over h.

2479
05:18:24,400 --> 05:18:29,360
The quantity h on this denominator looks like a single entity, but it still represents

2480
05:18:29,360 --> 05:18:36,800
a difference in x values. Let's find and simplify the difference quotient for this function given.

2481
05:18:38,000 --> 05:18:41,120
First, I'll write down the general formula for the difference quotient.

2482
05:18:41,360 --> 05:18:50,480
That's f of x plus h minus f of x over h. I'm going to compute f of x plus h first,

2483
05:18:51,040 --> 05:18:57,200
I do this by shoving in x plus h everywhere I see an x in the formula for the function.

2484
05:18:58,560 --> 05:19:07,760
So that's going to give me two times x plus h squared minus x plus h plus three.

2485
05:19:07,760 --> 05:19:13,520
Notice how I use parentheses here. That's important because I need to make sure

2486
05:19:13,520 --> 05:19:19,520
I shove in the entire x plus h for x. So the entire x plus h needs to be subtracted,

2487
05:19:19,520 --> 05:19:22,560
not just the x part. So the parentheses are mandatory.

2488
05:19:23,920 --> 05:19:30,000
Similarly, the parentheses here signal that the entire x plus h is squared as it needs to be.

2489
05:19:30,480 --> 05:19:38,320
I'm going to go ahead and simplify a bit right now. I can multiply out the x plus h squared.

2490
05:19:39,040 --> 05:19:47,440
I can go ahead and distribute the negative sign. So if I multiply out, I'm going to get x squared

2491
05:19:47,440 --> 05:19:57,280
plus xh plus hx plus h squared. Now I can distribute the two to get two x squared plus

2492
05:19:57,760 --> 05:20:06,160
two xh plus two hx plus two h squared minus x minus h plus three. These two terms are actually the

2493
05:20:06,160 --> 05:20:15,600
same. I can add them up to get four xh. And I think that's as simple as I can get that part.

2494
05:20:16,640 --> 05:20:21,920
Now I'm going to write out f of x plus h minus f of x. So that's going to be

2495
05:20:22,640 --> 05:20:30,880
this thing right here minus f of x. Again, I need to put the f of x formula in parentheses to make

2496
05:20:30,880 --> 05:20:37,440
sure I subtract the whole thing. I'll distribute the negative. And now I notice that a bunch of

2497
05:20:37,440 --> 05:20:43,680
things cancel out. So the two x squared and the minus two x squared add to zero, the minus x and

2498
05:20:43,680 --> 05:20:54,800
the x add to zero, and the three and the minus three add to zero. So I'm left with four xh plus

2499
05:20:54,800 --> 05:21:04,240
two h squared minus h. Finally, I'll write out the whole difference quotient by dividing everything

2500
05:21:04,240 --> 05:21:10,640
by h. I can simplify this further because notice that there's an h in every single term of the

2501
05:21:10,640 --> 05:21:18,640
numerator. If I factor out this h, h times four x plus two h minus one divided by h,

2502
05:21:19,280 --> 05:21:25,840
these two h's cancel. And I'm left with a difference quotient of four x plus two h minus one.

2503
05:21:27,440 --> 05:21:32,240
This difference quotient will become important in calculus. When we calculate a difference quotient

2504
05:21:32,240 --> 05:21:37,120
for smaller and smaller values of h, eventually letting h go to zero and ending up with an

2505
05:21:37,120 --> 05:21:43,120
expression that has no h is in it and represents the derivative or slope of the function itself.

2506
05:21:44,560 --> 05:21:51,920
In this video, we use the formula f of b minus f of a over b minus a to calculate an average rate

2507
05:21:51,920 --> 05:22:00,160
of change and the related formula f of x plus h minus f of x over h to calculate and simplify a

2508
05:22:00,160 --> 05:22:09,200
difference quotient.
