0	22560	This video introduces functions and their domains and ranges.
23200	30400	A function is a correspondence between input numbers, usually the x values, and output numbers,
30400	37680	usually the y values, that sends each input number to exactly one output number. Sometimes a
37680	46720	function is thought of as a rule or machine in which you can feed in x values as input and get
46720	53840	out y values as output. So a non-mathematical example of a function might be the biological
53840	61280	mother function, which takes as input any person and gives as output their biological mother.
62400	68960	This function satisfies the condition that each input number object person in this case
69760	76400	gets sent to exactly one output person, because if you take any person they just have
76400	82320	one biological mother. So that rule does give you a function, but if I change things around
82960	90640	and just use the mother function, which sends to each person their mother, that's no longer
90640	94560	going to be a function because there are some people who have more than one mother, right? They
94560	99360	could have a biological mother and adopted mother or a mother and a stepmother or any
99360	105520	number of situations. So since there's at least some people who you would put it as input and then
105520	112080	you'd get like more than one possible output, that violates this rule of functions. It would not be a
112080	117040	function. Now most of the time we'll work with functions that are described with equations,
117040	122480	not in terms of mothers. So for example, we could have the function y equals x squared plus one.
122640	129200	This can also be written as f of x equals x squared plus one. Here f of x is function notation
129200	137120	that stands for the output value of y. Notice that this notation is not representing multiplication.
137120	144000	We're not multiplying f by x. Instead, we're going to be putting in a value for x's input
144000	151360	and getting out a value of f of x or y. For example, if we want to evaluate f of two,
151600	158800	we're plugging in two as input for x either in this equation or in that equation. Since
160000	169360	f of two means two squared plus one f of two is going to equal five. Similarly, f of five means
169360	178560	I plug in five for x. So that's going to be five squared plus one or 26. Sometimes it's useful
178560	183680	to evaluate a function on a more complicated expression involving other variables. In this
183680	189200	case, remember, the functions value on any expression is just when you what you get when you
189200	198480	plug in that whole expression for x. So f of a plus three is going to be the quantity a plus
198480	208080	three squared plus one. We could rewrite that as a squared plus six a plus nine plus one,
208080	215600	or a squared plus six a plus 10. When evaluating a function on a complex expression, it's important
215600	222480	to keep the parentheses when you plug in for x. That way, you evaluate the function on the whole
222480	232960	expression. For example, it would be wrong to write f of a plus three equals a plus three
232960	236800	squared plus one without the parentheses, because that would imply that we were just
236800	246000	squaring the three and not the whole expression a plus three. Sometimes a function is described
246000	252160	with a graph instead of an equation. In this example, this graph is supposed to represent
252880	259680	the function g of x. Not all graphs actually represent functions. For example, the graph
259680	265680	of a circle doesn't represent a function. That's because the graph of a circle violates the vertical
265680	270720	line test, you can draw a vertical line, and I'll intersect the graph in more than one point.
271440	276320	But our graph at left satisfies the vertical line test, any vertical line intersects the graph and
276320	282320	at most one point. That means it's a function, because every x value will have at most one y
282320	291280	value that corresponds to it. Let's evaluate g of two. Note that two is an x value. And we'll use
291280	298800	the graph to find the corresponding y value. So I look for two on the x axis, and find the point
298800	306560	on the graph that has that x value. That's right here. Now I can look at the y value of that point,
306560	313920	looks like three, and therefore g of two is equal to three. If I try to do the same thing to evaluate
313920	321520	g of five, I run into trouble. Five is an x value, I look for it on the x axis, but there's no point
322480	331200	on the graph that has that x value. Therefore, g of five is undefined, or we can say it does not
331200	337440	exist. The question of what x values and y values make sense for a function leads us to a discussion
337440	344240	of domain and range. The domain of a function is all possible x values that make sense for that
344240	350800	function. The range is the y values that make sense for the function. In this example, we saw
350800	357760	that the x value of five didn't have a corresponding y value for this function. So the x value of five
357760	364240	is not in the domain of our function g. To find the x values in the domain, we have to look at
364240	370720	the x values that correspond to points on the graph. When we do that is to take the shadow
370720	378560	or projection of the graph onto the x axis, and see what x values are hit. It looks like we're
378560	386560	hitting all x values starting at negative eight and continuing up to four. So our domain
387920	393920	is the x's between negative eight and four, including those endpoints, or we can write this
393920	400720	in interval notation as negative eight comma four with square brackets. To find the range of the
400720	406160	function, we look for the y values corresponding to points on this graph. We can do that
406560	412080	by taking the shadow or projection of the graph onto the y axis.
415360	424880	We seem to be hitting all y values from negative five up through three. So our range
426240	433040	is wise between negative five and three, or an interval notation negative five three
433040	438720	with square brackets. If we meet a function that's described as an equation instead of a graph,
439520	445280	one way to find the domain and range are to graph the function. But it's often possible to find the
445280	451280	domain at least more quickly by using algebraic considerations. We think about what x values
451280	456480	it makes sense to plug into this expression, and what x values need to be excluded because they
456480	462320	make the algebraic expression impossible to evaluate. Specifically, to find the domain of a function,
463280	470960	we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero, since we can't divide by zero.
472160	479760	We also need to exclude x values that make an expression inside a square root sign negative,
479760	484320	since we can't take the square root of a negative number. In fact, we need to exclude
484320	490800	values that make expression inside any even root negative, because we can't take an even root of
490800	495120	a negative number, even though we can take an odd root like a cube root of a negative number.
495840	500240	Later, when we look at logarithmic functions, we'll have some additional exclusions that we
500240	506240	have to make. But for now, these two principles should handle all functions we'll see. So let's
506240	513200	apply them to a couple examples. For the function in part a, we don't have any square root signs,
513200	519440	but we do have a denominator. So we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero. In other
519440	528960	words, we need x squared minus four x plus three to not be equal to zero. If we solve x squared minus
528960	537040	four x plus three equal to zero, we can do that by factoring. And that gives us x equals three or
537040	543920	x equals one. So we need to exclude these values. All other x values should be fine. So if I draw
543920	551280	the number line, I can put on one and three and just dig out a hole at both of those. And
551280	558080	my domain includes everything else on the number line. In interval notation, this means my domain
558080	564160	is everything from negative infinity to one together with everything from one to three together
564160	571040	with everything from three to infinity. In this second example, we don't have any
571040	578240	denominator to worry about, but we do have a square root sign. So we need to exclude any x values
578240	585840	that make three minus two x less than zero. In other words, we can include all x values for
585840	592240	which three minus two x is greater than or equal to zero. Solving that inequality gives us three is
592240	600960	greater than or equal to two x. In other words, x is less than or equal to three halves. I can
600960	608800	draw this on the number line, or write it in interval notation. Notice that three halves is
608800	615120	included. And that's because three minus two x is allowed to be zero, I can take the square root of
615120	621200	zero, it's just zero. And that's not a problem. Finally, let's look at a more complicated function
621200	626080	that involves both a square root and a denominator. Now there are two things I need to worry about.
627440	636240	I need the denominator to not be equal to zero. And I need the stuff inside the square root sign
636240	641760	to be greater than or equal to zero. From our earlier work, we know that the first condition
641760	648160	means that x is not equal to three, and x is not equal to one. And the second condition
648160	653920	means that x is less than or equal to three halves. Let's draw both of those conditions
653920	661600	on the number line. x is not equal to three and x is not equal to one means we've got everything
662640	668880	except those two dug out points. And the other condition x is less than or equal to three halves
668880	675760	means we can have three halves and everything to the left of it. Now to be in our domain and to be
675760	680000	legit for our function, we need both of these conditions to be true. So I'm going to connect
680000	685200	these conditions with an and. And that means we're looking for numbers on the number line that are
685200	692160	colored both red and blue. So I'll draw that above in purple. So that's everything from three halves
692160	698240	to one, I have to dig out one because one was a problem for the denominator. And then I can continue
698240	704160	for all the things that are colored both, both colors red and blue. So my final domain is going
704160	712880	to be, let's see, negative infinity up to but not including one together with one, but not including
712880	718160	it to three halves and I include three halves since that was colored both red and blue also.
719280	724480	In this video, we talked about functions, how to evaluate them, and how to find domains and ranges.
726240	731040	This video is a brief introduction to increasing and decreasing functions based on their graphs.
731440	737360	In this first example, I've graphed two lines. The first line is an increasing function.
738640	744960	Because as the x values go from left to right, the y values are going up.
747040	753440	This can be written more formally by saying if x two is bigger than x one, these are supposed to
753440	759680	be x values. So that means that x two is some x value that's to the right, so that it's bigger.
761040	768320	The next one. So whenever we have an x value x two that's bigger than x one, increasing means
768320	778080	that f of x two has to be bigger than f of x one, so that the y values are getting bigger
778080	784800	when the x values are bigger. The second line is an example of a decreasing function.
785360	792960	Because here as the x values increase from left to right, the y values are going down.
793920	800880	So again, we can write this more formally by saying that whenever we have an x value x two
800880	807120	that's bigger than x one, for example, this might be x two and this might be x one, then
807840	816560	the y value f of x two is less than f of x one this time, because here, when we have a bigger x
816560	824320	value, we want to have a smaller y value to be decreasing. This second example gives the graph
824320	830480	of a function that's increasing in some places, but decreasing in others. This part of the graph,
831120	837360	here, the function's decreasing, because as the x values increase from left to right, the y values
837360	845360	go down. Over here, we also have a part of the graph where the function is decreasing. Now, this
845360	850160	part of the graph, the function's increasing, because as x goes from left to right, the y values
850160	857200	are going up. I'll mark that one in green for increasing. And finally, on this part of the
857760	863440	graph, the functions neither increasing nor decreasing is completely flat or constant.
864640	868720	Now, we're asked to describe the intervals on which the graph is increasing or decreasing.
868720	875440	So we describe those intervals in terms of the x values. It wouldn't make sense to describe them
875440	879520	in terms of the y values, because the y values can be the same for different parts of the graph,
879520	885680	but the x values are always unique. To describe where this function is decreasing,
888080	894480	that's for x values between negative four and negative two, and between four and seven.
895440	901360	I can write this using inequalities as negative four less than x less than negative two,
902400	908400	four less than x less than seven. It's not important whether I use less than or less than
908400	915280	or equal to signs here. I'm going to use less than or equal to signs at the end points of the
915280	920880	function's domain, where the function stops existing altogether. And I'll use strict less
920880	926800	than signs, just where the function starts or stops decreasing in the middle of its domain.
926800	932560	But again, that's not important. To describe where the function is increasing,
935200	943680	that's for x values in between negative two and one. So I can write that as an inequality as negative
943680	951120	two less than x less than one. I can also describe these intervals in interval notation. So that would
951120	960080	be close bracket negative four negative two open bracket, a cup sign for union, and then four comma
960080	968000	seven for the decreasing part and the increasing part is negative two comma one. I'm going to modify
968000	973600	my graph just a little bit now by putting arrows on the end. When I have arrows instead of
973600	980160	dots or just hard stops, that signifies that the function continues in the same direction forever.
980800	986800	So if I write it like that, then the place where the function is increasing is still the same,
986800	994320	it's still going to be from x values going from negative two to one. But now the decreasing part
994320	1001600	of the function extends further. So this section, these x values extend all the way out to infinity
1001600	1006320	and it we assume that it keeps going keeps decreasing here. So I would write that as
1008960	1016400	for infinity. And similarly, the left part, I would write as negative infinity, negative two,
1017040	1022320	because the function is going on forever in this direction to set x values go all the way to negative
1022320	1028400	infinity on that chunk. So when talking about increasing and decreasing parts of functions
1028400	1034080	based on graphs, the thing to remember is that x is going to be heading from
1035200	1043280	left to right. As long as you do that increasing just means that y goes up. Decreasing means that
1043280	1052480	y goes down. And if you're describing the intervals, you have to do that in terms of x values.
1052480	1061200	This video is about identifying maximums and minimums for functions from their graphs.
1062560	1064080	We'll start with some definitions.
1066000	1073120	A function f of x has an absolute maximum at the x value of x equals C, if the y value
1073120	1081120	at x equals C is as big as it ever gets. We can write this more precisely by saying that
1081840	1089920	f of C, that's the y value at x equals C is bigger than or equal to f of x, that's the y value at
1089920	1104800	some other x value. For all x values in the domain of f, that biggest y value f of C is called the
1104800	1113600	absolute maximum value for f. And the point with an x value and a y value given is called an
1113600	1122480	absolute maximum point. If I have a graph of a function, then the absolute maximum value
1123200	1129840	f of C is the highest value that function ever achieves. And the absolute maximum point
1130400	1137120	is the point where it achieves that value. Now it's possible for a function to have more than one
1137120	1143040	absolute maximum point, if there happens to be a tie where that highest value is achieved.
1143840	1148560	But a function can only have at most one absolute maximum value.
1149120	1156960	A function f of x has an absolute minimum at x equals C, if the y value
1158960	1167200	at x equals C is as small as it ever gets. We can write this more precisely by saying that
1167200	1176720	f of C is less than or equal to f of x for all x values in the domain of f.
1179280	1190240	The y value f of C is called the absolute minimum value of f. And the point C f of C
1190880	1196320	is called an absolute minimum point. In the graph of f of x,
1198160	1206720	f of C is now the lowest y value that the graph ever achieves. And the point C f of C
1206720	1213040	is the point where it achieves this very low y value. For example, this function
1213600	1220720	has an absolute minimum value of about negative eight. And it has an absolute minimum point
1222160	1230480	with coordinates three negative eight. If this function stops here and has domain from x values
1230480	1238320	just from zero to four, then the function will have an absolute maximum value of 10
1239200	1247680	achieved at the point with coordinates for 10. If however, the function keeps going on forever,
1248400	1251360	then it will have no absolute maximum value at all.
1252000	1262080	Absolute maximum minimum values can also be called global maximum and minimum values.
1264480	1273040	A function f of x has a local maximum at x equals C. If the y value at the x value of C
1273040	1280000	is bigger than any y values nearby, it doesn't have to be the biggest y value anywhere in the domain.
1280480	1285600	There's bigger y values up here. It just has to be the biggest y value nearby,
1285600	1290320	or more precisely, in an open interval of x values around C.
1291760	1299440	We can write this by saying that f of C is bigger than or equal to f of x for all x values
1299680	1313040	in an open interval around C. The y value f of C is called a local maximum value for f,
1313840	1319440	and the point with coordinates C f of C is called a local maximum point.
1319680	1330720	A function f of x has a local minimum at x equals C, if f of C is less than or equal to f of x
1331360	1342240	for all x values in an open interval around C. The y value f of C is called a local minimum value,
1342240	1349600	and the point with coordinates C f of C is called a local minimum point.
1351360	1354400	A function might have many local minimum values.
1358160	1368800	In this example, assuming that the domain is from zero to four, we have a local minimum point
1368800	1377440	at x equals three, because this point here is the lowest point anywhere nearby. It also happens
1377440	1384160	to be an absolute minimum point. Turning our attention to local maximum points, this function
1384160	1392080	has a local maximum point at one, two, say, because this point here is the highest point
1392080	1396560	anywhere nearby, even though it's not the highest point anywhere in the domain since
1396560	1404480	they're highest points, higher points over here. So we have a local max point at one,
1404480	1412400	two, which is not an absolute max. Different sources use different conventions as far as
1412400	1418640	whether the point four, 10 up here counts as a local maximum point or not. Some sources do
1418640	1423840	consider it a local maximum, since it's the highest point anywhere nearby. But other sources
1423840	1429360	say that it doesn't count as a local maximum, for the technical reason that you can't get an
1429360	1435760	open interval of values around four, because the function is not defined in an open interval around
1435760	1442240	four, because its domain stops at four. So I'll just write this as a caution that some sources
1442400	1447040	do not consider
1449360	1461280	for 10 to be a local max point, because f is not defined in an open interval
1462080	1474480	around x equals four. Local maximum and minimum values can also be called relative maximum and
1474480	1483760	minimum values. Please pause the video for a moment to mark all local maximum minimum points
1483760	1487600	on the graph of this function, as well as all absolute maximum points.
1487920	1496480	The function has a local max point here, at the point with coordinates approximately say 2.7,
1496480	1504480	3.3. It's a local max point, because it's the highest point anywhere nearby. There's a local min
1504480	1510880	point right here, at the point with coordinates two, two, since this is the lowest point anywhere
1511040	1517200	nearby. If this point actually existed, it would also be a local min point, as well as an absolute
1517200	1522560	min point. But this drilled out circle means that point is not actually part of the graph.
1523360	1531120	So there's no local min point here, and no absolute min point. The point here, with coordinates 0,4,
1531120	1536960	is considered by some sources to be a local max point. But by other sources, it's not considered
1537520	1544560	a local max point, since the function is not defined in an open interval around zero.
1545520	1550000	Turning our attention to absolute maximum min points, while there's no absolute max point,
1550000	1557920	since the function keeps going up and up and up forever. There's also no absolute min point,
1557920	1563760	because the function just keeps going down and down a little by a little and never actually
1563760	1569840	achieves the lowest value. Now, if we're talking about local max and min values, that's just the
1569840	1577120	y values of the local max and min points. So there's a local max value at this y value of 3.3.
1577920	1584880	And there's a local min value of two, this points y value. There are no absolute max or
1584880	1594560	min values for this function. In this video, we defined absolute and local max and min
1596000	1601680	points and values. This video is about symmetry of graphs and functions.
1603280	1608000	We say that a graph is symmetric with respect to the x axis, if
1608480	1619760	the graph has mirror symmetry with the x axis as the mirror line. This graph here is an example.
1619760	1629120	Here is the mirror line. Notice that the point five, three is on this graph. And so it's mirror image
1629120	1636240	and so it's mirror image five negative three is also on the graph. Similarly, the point
1636960	1644160	two two is on the graph and its mirror image two negative two is on the graph. For any point
1644880	1652000	x y on a graph, its mirror image when you flip over the x axis will have coordinates,
1652560	1659920	the same x coordinate, and the opposite of the y coordinate. Therefore, we can say that
1659920	1665600	a graph is symmetric with respect to the x axis. If whenever a point x y is on the graph,
1665600	1673120	the point x negative y is also on the graph. We say that a graph is symmetric with respect to
1673120	1684480	the y axis if it has mirror symmetry with the y axis as the mirror line. This graph is symmetric
1684480	1692960	with respect to the y axis. Here is the mirror line. Notice that the point with coordinates two
1692960	1699360	three is on this graph. It's mirror image, which is also on the graph has coordinates
1700000	1707120	negative two three. So the same y coordinate, but the opposite x coordinate. And in fact,
1708880	1716000	if I take any point with coordinates x y, and I want its mirror image with the y axis as a
1716000	1724560	mirror line, I'm going to get a point with the same height, the same y coordinate, but the opposite
1724560	1730160	x coordinate. So I can say that a graph is symmetric with respect to the y axis. If whenever
1730160	1738480	a point x y is on the graph, the point negative x y is also on the graph. Finally, a graph is
1738480	1750720	symmetric with respect to the origin, if it has 180 degree rotational symmetry around the origin.
1751440	1761120	This means that if I spin it by 180 degrees, the graph should line up exactly with itself.
1762560	1767520	Rotating a graph by 180 degrees is the same thing as turning it upside down. So one way to see if
1767520	1773280	a graph has symmetry respect to the origin is to turn it upside down and see if it looks exactly
1773280	1779600	the same. This one does. Playing around with points, I noticed that the point
1780960	1788320	one negative two is on this graph. If I rotate that point around the origin by 180 degrees,
1789760	1797920	I get to the point with coordinates negative one two. If I start with the point on the graph
1797920	1804000	with coordinates two three, and I rotate by 180 degrees, I get the point with coordinates
1805600	1815040	negative two negative three. And in general, if I start with a point x y, and I rotate that 180
1815040	1822960	degrees around the origin, I get the point with coordinates negative x negative y. So we can say
1822960	1828480	that a graph is symmetric with respect to the origin. If whenever a point x y is on the graph,
1828480	1835120	the point negative x negative y is also on the graph. Please pause the video for a moment and
1835120	1840560	decide which of these graphs are symmetric with respect to the x axis, the y axis, and the origin.
1841120	1847840	Some graphs may have more than one type of symmetry. Graph a is symmetric with respect to the origin.
1848800	1853760	Because if you rotate it by 180 degrees, that is, you turn it upside down, it looks exactly the
1853760	1858720	same. It does not have any mirror symmetry. So it's not symmetric with respect to the x axis or the
1858720	1867360	y axis. Graph B does have mirror symmetry. I'll draw on the two mirror lines. So it's both symmetric
1867360	1874400	with respect to the x axis, and symmetric with respect to the y axis. It also looks exactly
1874400	1881520	the same upside down. So it's also symmetric with respect to the origin. Graph C is symmetric
1881520	1887840	with respect to the y axis, but has no other symmetry. And graph D is symmetric with respect
1887840	1898400	to the x axis with no other symmetry. We use the words even and odd to describe functions whose
1898400	1904640	graphs have certain kinds of symmetry. A function is even if its graph is symmetric
1905920	1912000	with respect to the y axis. Remember that being symmetric with respect to the y axis
1912000	1919920	means that whenever a point x y is on the graph, its mirror image negative x y is also on the graph.
1919920	1932160	That is, the y values corresponding to x and negative x are the same. Using function notation,
1932160	1940560	I can write these points as the points with coordinates x, f of x, and negative x, f of
1940560	1948960	negative x, since the y value of her function is given by f of its x value. So we can say that a
1948960	1958080	function f of x is even if f of negative x equals f of x for all x values in its domain.
1959360	1966640	The function has the same height at x and negative x. For example, we can see that function f of x
1966640	1971360	equals x squared plus three is even. And one way to see this is by looking at its graph,
1971360	1976640	which looks pretty much like the graph I've drawn. And noticing that its graph is symmetric
1976720	1982720	across the y axis. But we can also check that this function is even algebraically
1982720	1989440	without knowing anything about its graph. All we have to do is check that f of negative x is equal
1989440	1998880	to f of x. So if we plug in negative x for x into this formula, that's negative x squared plus three,
1998880	2005600	but negative x squared is the same thing as x squared. And so this is exactly the same thing
2005600	2013040	as f of x. And the property of being even is satisfied. We say that a function f of x is odd
2013760	2022000	if its graph is symmetric with respect to the origin. Recall that a graph is symmetric with
2022000	2030160	respect to the origin means that whenever a point x y is on the graph, it's 180 degree
2030160	2036880	80 degree rotation point, negative x, negative y is also on the graph. That is,
2037600	2044080	the graphs y value at x, and the graphs y value at negative x are the opposites of each other,
2044880	2051200	same magnitude, but opposite sign. If we use function notation for the coordinates of these
2051200	2059440	points, this one is x, f of x. And this one is negative x, f of negative x, right, because
2060160	2068080	the y value for a function at the x value of negative x is just f of negative x. So for a
2068080	2077680	function to be odd, we see that f of negative x, that y value has to be the opposite of f of x,
2077680	2086800	the other guy's y value. A function f of x is odd if f of negative x is the negative of f of x
2087440	2095680	for all x in its domain. Let's look at this example, we could draw its graph and verify
2095680	2101280	the functions odd by seeing that rotational symmetry around the origin on its graph. But we
2101280	2107520	can also figure it out algebraically by checking to see that f of negative x is equal to negative
2107680	2114560	of f of x. So let's plug in negative x for x in the formula for f that gives us five times negative
2114560	2123360	x minus one over negative x, that simplifies to negative five x plus one over x. And we can see
2123360	2130640	that that is actually the negative of five x minus one over x by factoring out a negative sign,
2131280	2141520	which is negative f of x. So the property for being odd holds. In this video, we talked about
2141520	2149280	symmetry with respect to the x axis, symmetry with respect to the y axis, and symmetry with
2149280	2155280	respect to the origin. Functions that are symmetric with respect to the y axis are even
2155360	2160080	functions, and functions that are symmetric with respect to the origin are odd functions.
2160960	2165680	There's no word for functions that are symmetric with respect to the x axis. And that's because
2165680	2170160	if your graph is symmetric with respect to the x axis, it's not going to be a function.
2171760	2176720	This video gives the graphs of some commonly used functions that I call the toolkit functions.
2177600	2183280	The first function is the function y equals x. Let's plot a few points on the graph of this
2183280	2193440	function. If x is zero, y zero, if x is one, y is one, and so on, y is always equal to x,
2194160	2198960	doesn't have to just be an integer, it can be any real number. And we're connecting the dots,
2198960	2206480	we get a straight line through the origin. Let's look at the graph of y equals x squared. If x is
2206480	2216000	zero, y is zero, so we go through the origin again, if x is one, y is one. And if x is negative one,
2216000	2223760	y is also one. The x value of two gives a y value of four and the x value of negative two gives a
2223760	2232480	y value of four also. Connecting the dots, we get a parabola. Notice this this function
2232480	2240720	is an even function. That means it has mirror symmetry across the y axis, the left side looks
2240720	2246320	like exactly like the mirror image of the right side. That happens because when you square a
2246320	2254000	positive number like two, you get the exact same y value as when you square its mirror image x value
2254000	2262160	of negative two. The next function y equals x cubed, I'll call that a cubic. Let's plot a few
2262160	2270320	points when x is zero, y is zero, when x is one, y is one, when x is negative one, y is negative one,
2271040	2276640	two goes with the point eight way up here and an x value of negative two is going to give us
2276640	2281840	negative eight. If I connect the dots, I get something that looks kind of like this.
2283680	2292640	This function is what's called an odd function, because it has 180 degree rotational symmetry
2292640	2297840	around the origin. If I rotate this whole graph by 180 degrees, or in other words, turn the paper
2297840	2304720	upside down, I'll get exactly the same shape. The reason this function has this odd symmetry
2304720	2312560	is because when I cube a positive number and get its y value, I get and cube the corresponding
2312560	2318800	negative number to get its y value, the negative number cubed gives us exactly the negative of
2318800	2325840	the the y value we get with cubing the positive number. Let's look at the next example, y equals
2325840	2334880	a square root of x. Notice that the domain of this function is just x values bigger than or
2334880	2339760	equal to zero, because we can't take the square root of a negative number. Let's plug in a few
2339760	2347360	x values, x is zero gives y is zero, x is one, square root of one is one, square root of four is two.
2348240	2351440	And connecting the dots, I get a function that looks like this.
2351600	2358400	The absolute value function is next. Again, if we plug in a few points,
2359600	2367120	x is zero goes with y equals zero, x is one gives us one, the absolute value of negative one is one
2368800	2374960	to two is on the graph and the absolute value of negative two is two. I'm ending up getting
2375680	2381040	a v shaped graph. It also has even or mirror symmetry.
2382960	2389040	y equals two to the x is what's known as an exponential function. That's because the variable
2389040	2392720	x is in the exponent. If I plot a few points,
2392800	2406400	two to the zero is one, two to the one is two, two squared is four, two to the minus one is one
2406400	2413200	half. I'll plot these on my graph. And let me fill in a few more points. So let's see,
2413840	2420320	two cubed is eight, that's way up here. And negative two gives me one fourth, one eighth.
2420880	2423920	Connecting the dots, I get something that's shaped like this.
2425760	2430640	You might have heard the expression exponential growth, when talking about, for example, population
2430640	2438000	growth. This is function is represents exponential growth, it grows very, very steeply. Every time
2438000	2442800	we increase the x coordinate by one, we double the y coordinate.
2442800	2451680	We could also look at a function like y equals three to the x or sometimes y equals e to the x,
2451680	2459840	where e is just a number about 2.7. These functions look very similar. It's just the bigger base
2459840	2466880	makes us rise a little more steeply. Now let's look at the function y equals one over x.
2467840	2474720	It's not defined when x is zero, but I can plug in x equals one half, one over one half is two,
2476640	2484480	one over one is one, and one over two is one half. If I connect the dots, I get this shape
2485120	2489920	in the first quadrant, but I haven't looked at negative values of x, when x is negative,
2490000	2494800	one over negative one is negative one, one over negative a half is negative two.
2495600	2503280	And I get a similar looking piece in the third quadrant. This is an example of a hyperbola.
2505840	2513200	And it's also an odd function, because it has that 180 degree rotational symmetry.
2513200	2515920	If I turn the page upside down, it'll look exactly the same.
2516880	2523520	Finally, let's look at y equals one over x squared. Again, it's not defined when x is zero,
2523520	2531600	but I can plug in points like one half or x, let's see one over one half squared is one over one
2531600	2541600	fourth, which is four. And one over one squared, one over two squared is a fourth. It's pretty much
2541600	2546560	like the previous function, it's just a little bit more extreme rises a little more steeply,
2546560	2551520	falls a little more dramatically. But for negative values of x, something a little bit different
2551520	2557840	goes on. For example, one over negative two squared is just one over four, which is a fourth.
2558400	2565120	So I can plot that point there. And one over negative one squared, that's just one.
2566160	2570480	So my curve for negative values of x is going to lie in the second quadrant,
2570480	2574720	not the third quadrant. This is an example of an even function.
2576480	2580640	Because it has perfect mirror symmetry across the y axis.
2582000	2586880	These are the toolkit functions. And I recommend you memorize the shape of each of them.
2588160	2593360	That way you can draw at least a rough sketch very quickly without having to plug in points.
2594480	2597040	That's all for the graphs of the toolkit functions.
2597040	2605600	If we change the equation of a function, then the graph of the function changes or transforms
2605600	2611680	in predictable ways. This video gives some rules and examples for transformations of functions.
2612400	2617280	To get the most out of this video, it's helpful if you're already familiar with the graph of some
2617280	2623920	typical functions, I call them toolkit functions, like y equals square root of x, y equals x squared,
2623920	2628480	y equals the absolute value of x and so on. If you're not familiar with those graphs,
2629040	2634080	I encourage you to watch my video called toolkit functions first before watching this one.
2635440	2641520	I want to start by reviewing function notation. If g of x represents the function the square root
2641520	2649280	of x, then we can rewrite these expressions in terms of square roots. For example, g of x minus
2649280	2659440	two is the same thing as the square root of x minus two. g of quantity x minus two means we plug
2659440	2667680	in x minus two everywhere we see an x. So that would be the same thing as the square root of
2667680	2674560	quantity x minus two. In the second example, I say that we're subtracting two on the inside of the
2674560	2680160	function because we're subtracting two before we apply the square root function. Whereas on the
2680160	2685760	first example, I say that the minus two is on the outside of the function, we're doing the square root
2685760	2692240	function first and then subtracting two. In this third example, g of three x, we're multiplying by
2692240	2698000	three on the inside of the function. To evaluate this in terms of square root, we plug in the entire
2698000	2705840	three x for x and the square root function. That gives us the square root of three x. In the next
2705840	2712000	example, we're multiplying by three on the outside of the function. This is just three times the square
2712000	2720720	root of x. Finally, g of minus x means the square root of minus x. This might look a little odd
2720720	2725200	because we're not used to taking the square root of a negative number. But remember that if x itself
2725200	2731280	is negative, like negative two, then negative x will be negative negative two or positive two. So
2731280	2736640	we'll really be taking the square root of a positive number in that case. Let me record which of these
2736640	2742240	are inside and which of these are outside of my function. In this next set of examples, we're using
2742240	2746720	the same function g of x a square root of x. But this time we're starting with an expression with
2746720	2754800	square roots in it and trying to write it in terms of g of x. So the first example, the plus 17 is
2754800	2760800	on the outside of my function, because I'm taking the square root of x first, and then adding 17. So
2760800	2770960	I can write this as g of x plus 17. In the second example, I'm taking x and adding 12 first, then
2770960	2776000	I take the square root of the whole thing. Since I'm adding the 12 to x first, that's on the inside
2776000	2784160	of my function. So I write that as g of the quantity x plus 12. Remember that this notation means
2784240	2790160	I plug in the entire x plus 12 into the square root sign, which gives me exactly square root of x
2790160	2797280	plus 12. In this next example, I'm doing the square root first and then multiply by negative 36. So my
2797280	2804400	minus 36 multiplication is outside my function. I can rewrite this as minus 36 times g of x.
2805520	2811360	Finally, in this last example, I take x multiply by a fourth and then apply the square root of x.
2811360	2818800	So that's the same thing as g of one fourth x, my one fourth x is on the inside of my function.
2818800	2822560	In other words, it's inside the parentheses when I use function notation.
2824400	2828160	Let's graph the square root of x and two transformations of this function.
2829280	2835200	y equals the square root of x goes through the points 0011 and 42, since the square root of
2835200	2842480	four is two, and looks something like this. In order to graph y equals the square root of x minus
2842480	2848080	two, notice that the minus two is on the outside of the function. That means we're going to take
2848080	2854960	the square root of x first and then subtract two. So for example, if we start with the x value of zero
2854960	2860640	and compute the square root of zero, that's zero, then we subtract two to give us a y value of negative
2860640	2868480	two. An x value of one, which under the square root function had a y value of one, now has a y
2868480	2876400	value that's decreased by two, one minus two is negative one. And finally, an x value of four,
2876400	2882800	which under the square root function had a y value of two, now has a y value of two minus two or zero,
2882800	2890240	its y value was also decreased by two. If I plot these new points, zero goes with negative two,
2890640	2896480	one goes with negative one, and four goes with zero, I have my transformed graph.
2898320	2904240	Because I subtracted two on the outside of my function, my y values were decreased by two,
2904240	2911440	which brought my graph down by two units. Next, let's look at y equals the square root of quantity
2911440	2916480	x minus two. Now we're subtracting two on the inside of our function, which means we subtract
2916480	2922160	two from x first and then take the square root. In order to get the same y value of zero as we
2922160	2928640	had in our blue graph, we need our x minus two to be zero. So we need our original x to be two.
2930080	2933520	In order to get the y value of one that we had in our blue graph,
2934400	2939120	we need to be taking the square root of one. So we need x minus two to be one,
2939120	2941840	which means that we need to start with an x value of three.
2942800	2949520	And in order to reproduce our y value of two from our original graph, we need the square root
2949520	2955520	of x minus two to be two, which means we need to start out by taking the square root of four,
2955520	2961040	which means our x minus two is four. So our x should be up there at six.
2962560	2968880	If I plot my x values with my corresponding y values of square root of x minus two,
2968960	2976000	I get the following graph. Notice that the graph has moved horizontally to the right by two units.
2977520	2984160	To me, moving down by two units makes sense because we're subtracting two. So we're decreasing
2984160	2989520	y's by two units. But the minus two on the inside, that kind of does the opposite of what I expect.
2989520	2996160	I might expect it to move the graph left. I might expect the x values to be going down by two units.
2996160	3002720	But instead, it moves the graph to the right because the x units have to go up by two units
3002720	3007040	in order to get the right square root when I then subtract two units again.
3007840	3010800	The observations we made for these transformations of functions
3011520	3018240	hold in general, according to the following rules. First of all, numbers on the outside of the function,
3018240	3024800	like in our example, y equals the square root of x minus two, those numbers affect the y values
3024800	3030560	and result in vertical motions, like we saw. These motions are in the direction you expect,
3030560	3036960	so subtracting two moves just down by two. If we were adding two instead, that would move us up by two.
3038240	3042000	Numbers on the inside of the function, that's like our example,
3042000	3048160	y equals the square root of quantity x minus two, those affect the x values and result in a
3048160	3053920	horizontal motion. These motions go in the opposite direction from what you expect. Remember,
3053920	3059360	the minus two on the inside actually shifted our graph to the right. If it had a plus two on the
3059360	3066720	inside, that would actually shift our graph to the left. Adding results in a shift, those are
3066720	3073840	called translations, but multiplying like something like y equals three times the square root of x,
3073840	3080720	that would result in a stretch or shrink. In other words, if I start with the square root of x,
3081040	3086640	and then want to graph y equals three times the square root of x, that stretches my graph
3086640	3095440	vertically by a factor of three, like this. If I want to graph y equals one third times the square
3095440	3103120	root of x, that shrinks my graph vertically by a factor of one third. Finally, a negative sign
3103120	3108800	results in reflection. For example, if I start with a graph of y equals the square root of x,
3109280	3115360	and then want to graph y equals the square root of negative x, that's going to do a reflection in
3115360	3121040	the horizontal direction because the negative is on the inside of the square root sign. A reflection
3121040	3128160	in the horizontal direction means a reflection across the y axis. If instead, I want to graph
3128160	3133280	y equals negative the square root of x, that negative sign on the outside means a vertical
3134240	3142080	reflection, a reflection across the x axis. Pause the video for a moment and see if you
3142080	3147760	could describe what happens in these four transformations. In the first example, we're
3147760	3153440	subtracting four on the outside of the function. Adding and subtracting means a translation or
3153440	3158720	shift. And since we're on the outside of the function that affects the y values, that's moving
3158720	3166000	us vertically. So this transformation should take the square root of graph and move it down
3166000	3174400	by four units. That would look something like this. In the next example, we're adding 12 on the
3174400	3180960	inside. That's still a translation, but now we're moving horizontally. And so since we go the
3180960	3186800	opposite direction we expect, we are going to go to the left by 12 units. That's going to look
3186800	3193040	something like this. In the next example, we're multiplying by three and introducing a negative
3193040	3199120	sign, both on the outside of our function. Outside our function means we're affecting the y values.
3199120	3206080	So and multiplication means we're stretching by a factor of three, the negative sign means we reflect
3206080	3212160	in the vertical direction. Here's stretching by a factor of three vertically, before I applied
3212160	3219920	the minus sign. And now the minus sign reflects in the vertical direction. Finally, in this last
3219920	3225760	example, we're multiplying by one quarter on the inside of our function. We know that multiplication
3225760	3232320	means stretch or shrink. And since we're on the inside, it's a horizontal motion. And it does the
3232320	3237840	opposite of what we expect. So instead of shrinking by a factor of one fourth horizontally, it's
3237840	3244400	actually going to stretch by the reciprocal, a factor of four horizontally. That'll look something
3244400	3250960	like this. Notice that stretching horizontally by a factor of four looks kind of like shrinking
3250960	3257120	vertically by a factor of one half. And that's actually borne out by the algebra, because the
3257120	3262080	square root of one fourth x is the same thing as the square root of one fourth times the square root
3262080	3268080	of x, which is the same thing as one half times the square root of x. And so now we can see
3268080	3274880	algebraically, that a vertical shrink by a factor of one half is the same as a horizontal
3274880	3279200	stretch by a factor of four, at least for this function, the square root function.
3280800	3285120	This video gave some rules for transformations of functions, which I'll repeat below.
3286080	3294000	Numbers on the outside correspond to changes in the y values, or vertical motions.
3295280	3301520	Numbers on the inside of the function affect the x values and result in horizontal motions.
3302640	3308240	Adding and subtracting corresponds to translations or shifts.
3308880	3313680	Multiplying and dividing by numbers corresponds to stretches and shrinks.
3314960	3322880	And putting in a negative sign corresponds to a reflection, a horizontal reflection,
3323600	3328480	if the negative sign is on the inside, and a vertical reflection, if the negative sign is on
3328480	3334480	the outside. Knowing these basic rules about transformations empowers you to be able to
3335440	3341520	sketch graphs of much more complicated functions, like y equals three times the square root of x
3341520	3349680	plus two, by simply considering the transformations one at a time. This video introduces piecewise
3349680	3358080	functions. A piecewise function is a function who's defined in pieces by two or more different rules
3358160	3364480	that apply for different x values. The rule for calculating this function is you calculate
3364480	3370960	negative x squared, if x is less than one, but you calculate negative two x plus three, if x is
3370960	3377760	greater than or equal to one. So if we want to find f of negative two, well, negative two is less
3377760	3386160	than one. So the first rule applies. And we compute f of negative two by plugging in negative two
3386160	3392320	for x in the first rule. So that's negative four. Next, if we want to find f of one,
3393280	3399200	well, one is right on the border in between the two rules. But because we have a greater than or
3399200	3406880	equal to here, when x is equal to one, we apply this rule. And so we can plug one into the formula
3406880	3412800	negative two x plus three, so that's negative two times one plus three, which gives us one as our
3412800	3419280	output. Finally, if we want to compute f of three, since three is bigger than or equal to one,
3419280	3426960	the second rule applies, and we plug three into that rule. That gives us an answer of negative three.
3427760	3433520	To graph f, it makes sense to also draw the graph in pieces. First, I'm going to draw the graph of
3433520	3441280	minus x squared. Just x squared would be a parabola opening up. So minus x squared is a parabola
3441280	3450800	opening down goes through the points negative one, negative one and one negative one. So it looks
3450800	3458000	something like this. Now I've drawn the whole parabola, but the rule actually only applies
3458000	3463920	when x is less than one. So I'll keep the part of the parabola when x is less than one, and I'll
3463920	3470400	erase the part of the parabola when x is greater than or equal to one. I'll leave an open circle
3470400	3477040	here when x equals one, since that point is not included in this definition either. Next, I'm going
3477040	3483680	to draw the second piece, the line y equals minus two x plus three. So that's a line with slope
3483680	3489920	negative two and intercept y intercept three, so it goes through this point zero three. And then it
3489920	3498800	goes over by one and down by two. So it goes through the point one one over by one down by two.
3499680	3502720	And I can continue and draw this straight line.
3506160	3510800	Again, we only want part of this graph, the part where x is greater than or equal to one. So I'll
3511440	3517440	erase the part where x is less than one, this part here. This time, I'm going to leave a closed
3517440	3524320	circle where x is equal to one, since that point is included on that graph. When drawing this graph,
3524320	3529760	it's good to think about what happens when x equals one, the border point, both in the
3530480	3535440	second rule, where we actually include that point, and in the first rule, where we don't
3535440	3539760	actually include that point, but we kind of have to draw it in order anyway to draw the open circle
3539760	3546640	here. Now the last question asks us if this function is continuous. The informal definition of
3546640	3550080	continuity that I'm going to use is that a function is continuous if you can draw the whole
3550080	3555360	thing without picking up your pencil. In this case, we can't, because we have to pick up our
3555360	3561920	pencil to get from the jump here up to here. So this function is not continuous, it's got a
3561920	3568400	discontinuity when x is one, which is exactly the border port between the two rules. Often,
3568400	3573920	piecewise functions will have discontinuities, where they transition from one rule to the next.
3574480	3578800	However, it's possible to have a piecewise defined function that has no discontinuity,
3578880	3584880	if the two pieces happen to line up perfectly. For example, if we've changed the function's
3584880	3590080	definition slightly, I'll call it g of x's time to still be the negative x squared,
3590080	3596320	when x is less than one, but this time, negative two x plus one, if x is bigger than or equal to one.
3597120	3605520	Then when we graph it, the parabola piece will look the same. But the linear piece will be two
3605520	3612400	units lower than before. And so it'll actually start right here at one negative one and go down,
3612400	3618160	and our function will be continuous. That's all for this introduction to piecewise functions.
3620160	3625840	The inverse of a function undoes what the function does. So the inverse of tying your shoes
3626480	3632720	would be to untie them. And the inverse of the function that adds two to a number
3633520	3640480	would be the function that subtracts two from a number. This video introduces inverses and
3640480	3647520	their properties. Suppose f of x is the function defined by this chart. In other words, f of two
3647520	3657040	is three, f of three is five, f of four is six, and f of five is one. The inverse function for f,
3657040	3665120	written f superscript negative one x undoes what f does. Since f takes two to three,
3666240	3674160	f inverse takes three back to two. So we write this f superscript negative one of three is two.
3676080	3683280	Similarly, since f takes three to five, f inverse takes five to three.
3683280	3693440	And since f takes four to six, f inverse of six is four. And since f takes five to one,
3693440	3701040	f inverse of one is five. I'll use these numbers to fill in the chart. Notice that the chart of
3701040	3707680	values when y equals f of x and the chart of values when y equals f inverse of x are closely
3707680	3715200	related. They share the same numbers, but the x values for f of x correspond to the y values
3715200	3722480	for f inverse of x. And the y values for f of x correspond to the x values for f inverse of x.
3723520	3728800	That leads us to the first key fact, inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x.
3730400	3733680	I'm going to plot the points for y equals f of x in blue.
3734320	3741120	Next, I'll plot the points for y equals f inverse of x in red. Pause the video for a moment and see
3741120	3746320	what kind of symmetry you observe in this graph. How are the blue points related to the red points?
3747680	3752800	You might have noticed that the blue points and the red points are mirror images over the mirror
3752800	3762320	line, y equals x. So our second key fact is that the graph of y equals f inverse of x can be obtained
3762320	3770800	from the graph of y equals f of x by reflecting over the line y equals x. This makes sense because
3770800	3780240	inverses reverse the roles of y and x. In the same example, let's compute f inverse of f of 2.
3780240	3789280	This open circle means composition. In other words, we're computing f inverse of f of 2. We compute
3789760	3800080	we compute this from the inside out. So that's f inverse of 3, since f of 2 is 3, and f inverse
3800080	3813280	of 3, we see as 2. Similarly, we can compute f of f inverse of 3. And that means we take f of f
3813280	3823200	inverse of 3. Since f inverse of 3 is 2, that's the same thing as computing f of 2, which is 3.
3825200	3829760	Please pause the video for a moment and compute these other compositions.
3834000	3840080	You should have found that in every case, if you take f inverse of f of a number, you get back to
3840080	3845200	the very same number you started with. And similarly, if you take f of f inverse of any number,
3845840	3854160	you get back to the same number you started with. So in general, f inverse of f of x is equal to x,
3854160	3860720	and f of f inverse of x is also equal to x. This is the mathematical way of saying that f and
3860720	3868000	inverse f inverse undo each other. Let's look at a different example. Suppose that f of x is x cubed.
3868080	3873920	Pause the video for a moment and guess what the inverse of f should be. Remember, f inverse undoes
3873920	3883280	the work that f does. You might have guessed that f inverse of x is going to be the cube root function.
3884480	3892080	Now we can check that this is true by looking at f of f inverse of x, that's f of the cube root of
3892160	3898480	of the cube root of function, which means the cube root function cubed, which gets us back to x.
3899360	3905680	Similarly, if we compute f inverse of f of x, that's the cube root of x cubed,
3906320	3912800	and we get back to x again. So the cube root function really is the inverse of the cubing
3912800	3917920	function. When we compose the two functions, we get back to the number that we started with.
3917920	3925200	It'd be nice to have a more systematic way of finding inverses of functions besides guessing
3925200	3933680	and checking. One method uses the fact that inverses reverse the roles of y and x. So if we
3933680	3940160	want to find the inverse of the function f of x equals five minus x over three x, we can write it
3940160	3950800	as y equals five minus x over three x, reverse the roles of y and x to get x equals five minus y
3950800	3958560	over three y, and then solve for y. To solve for y, let's multiply both sides by three y,
3961200	3967440	bring all terms with y's in them to the left side, and all terms without y's in them to the
3967440	3982960	right side, factor out the y and divide to isolate y. This gives us f inverse of x as five over three
3982960	3991120	x plus one. Notice that our original function f and our inverse function f inverse are both
3991120	3998240	rational functions, but they're not the reciprocals of each other. And in general, f inverse of x is
3998240	4006880	not usually equal to one over f of x. This can be confusing, because when we write two to the minus
4006880	4014960	one, that does mean one over two, but f to the minus one of x means the inverse function and not the
4014960	4022880	reciprocal. It's natural to ask if all functions have inverse functions. That is, for any function
4022880	4030480	you might encounter, is there always a function that is it is its inverse? In fact, the answer is no.
4032960	4037840	See if you can come up with an example of a function that does not have an inverse function.
4038160	4044560	The word function here is key. Remember, that a function is a relationship between x values and y
4044560	4053840	values, such that for each x value in the domain, there's only one corresponding y value.
4056960	4064640	One example of a function that does not have an inverse function is the function f of x equals x
4064640	4074160	squared. To see that the inverse of this function is not a function, note that for the x squared
4074160	4083440	function, the number two, and the number negative two, both go to the number four. So if I had an
4083440	4091680	inverse, it would have to send four to both two and negative two. The inverse would not be a function.
4092560	4097280	It might be easier to understand the problem. When you look at a graph of y equals x squared.
4099680	4108160	Recall that inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x and flip the graph over the line y equals x.
4109120	4115600	But when I flip the green graph over the line y equals x, I get this red graph. This red graph
4115600	4119920	is not the graph of a function, because it violates the vertical line test.
4121920	4126080	The reason that violates the vertical line test is because the original green function
4126640	4133840	violates the horizontal line test and has two x values with the same y value.
4135520	4141200	In general, a function f has an inverse function, if and only if the graph of f satisfies the
4141200	4146960	horizontal line test, i.e. every horizontal line intersects the graph in at most one point.
4146960	4153120	Pause the video for a moment and see which of these four graphs satisfy the horizontal line
4153120	4158720	test. In other words, which of the four corresponding functions would have an inverse function?
4161200	4168960	You may have found that graphs a and b violate the horizontal line test. So their functions
4168960	4176000	would not have inverse functions. But graphs C and D satisfy the horizontal line test. So these
4176000	4183120	graphs represent functions that do have inverses. Functions that satisfy the horizontal line test
4183120	4190400	are sometimes called one to one functions. Equivalently, a function is one to one,
4190400	4199600	if for any two different x values, x one and x two, the y values f of x one and f of x two
4199680	4208240	are different numbers. Sometimes this is said, f is one to one, if whenever f of x one is equal
4208240	4217040	to f of x two, then x one has to equal x two. As our last example, let's try to find p inverse
4217040	4224800	of x, where p of x is the square root of x minus two drawn here. If we graph p inverse on the same
4224800	4231840	axis as p of x, we get the following graph, simply by flipping over the line y equals x.
4233040	4239440	If we try to solve the problem algebraically, we can write y equal to square root of x minus two,
4240240	4247840	reverse the roles of y and x and solve for y by squaring both sides and adding two.
4248240	4254880	Now, if we were to graph y equals x squared plus two, that would look like a parabola. It would
4254880	4262720	look like the red graph, we've already drawn together with another arm on the left side.
4264160	4268640	But we know that our actual inverse function consists only of this right arm.
4269280	4276560	We can specify this algebraically by making the restriction that x has to be bigger than or equal
4276560	4285200	to zero. This corresponds to the fact that on the original graph for the square root of x, y was
4285200	4292320	only greater than or equal to zero. Looking more closely at the domain and range of p and p inverse,
4292400	4297600	we know that the domain of p is all values of x such that x minus two is greater than or equal to
4297600	4303600	zero, since we can't take the square root of a negative number. This corresponds to x values
4303600	4308880	being greater than or equal to two, or an interval notation, the interval from two to infinity.
4310400	4316880	The range of p, we can see here is greater than or equal to zero, since we can't take the square
4316880	4324720	interval from two to infinity. The range of p, we can see from the graph is all y values greater
4324720	4332960	than or equal to zero, or the interval from zero to infinity. Similarly, based on the graph,
4332960	4339600	we see the domain of p inverse is x values greater than or equal to zero, the interval from zero to
4339600	4346960	infinity, and the range of p inverse is y values greater than or equal to two, or the interval
4346960	4353360	from two to infinity. If you look closely at these domains and ranges, you'll notice that the domain of
4353360	4361840	p corresponds exactly to the range of p inverse, and the range of p corresponds to the domain of p
4361840	4371280	inverse. This makes sense, because inverse functions reverse the rules of y and x. The domain of f
4371280	4378240	inverse of x is the x values for f inverse, which corresponds to the y values, or the range of f.
4379200	4385680	The range of f inverse is the y values for f inverse, which correspond to the x values, or the
4385680	4393200	domain of f. In this video, we discussed five key properties of inverse functions.
4395040	4406000	Inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x. The graph of y equals f inverse of x is the graph
4406000	4415760	of y equals f of x reflected over the line y equals x. When we compose f with f inverse,
4416400	4423760	we get the identity function y equals x. And similarly, when we compose f inverse with f,
4424800	4428880	that brings x to x. In other words, f and f inverse undo each other.
4429280	4441920	The function f of x has an inverse function, if and only if the graph of y equals f of x
4442800	4455840	satisfies the horizontal line test. And finally, the domain of f is the range of f inverse,
4455840	4466400	and the range of f is the domain of f inverse. These properties of inverse functions will be
4466400	4472080	important when we study exponential functions and their inverses logarithmic functions.
4474000	4479520	There are different ways of describing the size of an angle. This video explains how to convert
4479520	4490400	between them. Angles are commonly measured using either degrees or radians. If we're talking about
4490400	4502160	degrees, then a full circle by convention is 360 degrees. A half circle then would be 180 degrees.
4502160	4509440	And if I wanted to do say a third of a circle, that would be a third of 360 degrees or 120 degrees.
4509920	4516000	If we're using radians instead, then going all the way around the circle
4517600	4525280	is called two pi radians. The two pi was chosen because that's the circumference of a circle
4525920	4533760	with radius of one. A half circle is then half of two pi radians, which is pi radians.
4533760	4544160	And if I wanted to do say a quarter of a circle, that would be a quarter of my two pi radians,
4544160	4553200	a quarter of two pi is pi over two. To convert between degrees and radians, it's handy to use
4553200	4562240	the fact that 180 degrees corresponds to pi radians. Both of these represent half of a circle.
4563840	4569760	Let's convert negative 135 degrees to radians. Now you might be wondering, what does a negative
4569760	4574720	angle even mean? Well, by convention, if we go in the counterclockwise direction,
4577040	4584160	that's considered a positive angle. And if we go in the clockwise direction,
4585120	4592880	that's considered a negative angle. To convert negative 135 degrees to radians,
4592880	4603040	I could multiply by pi radians per 180 degrees. Notice that the degrees cancel here. And I end up
4603040	4617680	with negative 135 pi over 180 radians. That simplifies to negative three pi over four radians.
4618400	4628560	Or if I convert pi to a decimal, that's negative 2.3562 radians up to four decimal places. But
4628560	4635200	usually if the answer is a simple fraction times pi, it's better to leave it in that form rather
4635200	4641040	than convert it to a decimal. I can also go the other direction and convert radians to degrees.
4641600	4649920	Five pi over four radians. Now, again, I need to use the fact that pi radians is 180 degrees. But
4649920	4656160	if I write it like this, with radians on the top, and degrees on the bottom, then the radians won't
4656160	4665120	cancel. So that doesn't work. Instead, instead, I need to multiply by 180 degrees over pi radians,
4665440	4675440	so that I can cancel the radians that way, the radians cancel. And I get five pi times 180 over
4675440	4684880	four pi degrees. Now the pies also cancel. And this simplifies to 225 degrees. Converting seven
4684880	4692960	radians to degrees is similar. I need to multiply by 180 degrees over pi radians. If I work out seven
4692960	4702640	times 180 over pi on my calculator, I get 401.07 degrees up to two decimal places.
4704160	4710000	Notice that my answer, a little more than 400 is more than 360 degrees. So this is more than a full
4710000	4717760	circle. That makes sense, since seven radians is more than two pi radians, since pi is itself a
4717760	4724880	little more than three. Sometimes angles are given in terms of degrees, minutes and seconds, as in
4725920	4739120	32 degrees, 17 minutes, and 25 seconds. A minute is defined as one sixtieth of a degree.
4740240	4747040	A second is defined as one sixtieth of a minute. But since a minute is itself one sixtieth of a
4747040	4756320	degree, this is one sixtieth of one sixtieth of a degree, or one over 3600 of a degree.
4757280	4763840	You can also think of this by saying that they're 60 minutes in one degree,
4765200	4770880	and they're 3600 seconds in one degree.
4771120	4778560	Let's convert this number of degrees, minutes and seconds to a decimal number of degrees.
4779760	4788080	We know that we have 32 degrees plus 17 minutes plus 25 seconds.
4789840	4796000	I'm going to copy down the 32 degrees, but I need to convert the minutes to degrees.
4796800	4802080	I know that there's 60 minutes in one degree. If I want the units to cancel, I better put the
4802080	4812000	degrees on the top. So one degree corresponds to 60 minutes. Similarly, if I want to convert
4812000	4821040	seconds to degrees, 25 seconds, I know that they're 3600 seconds in one degree. I want the degrees to
4821040	4827280	end up on the top and I want the seconds on the bottom to cancel with the 25 seconds. So I need
4827280	4837440	to write it this way. Okay, now I can write this as 32 degrees plus 17 over 60 degrees plus 25 over
4837440	4846400	3600 degrees. And because the minutes canceled, and the seconds canceled. If I add this all up on
4846400	4856240	my calculator, I get 32.2903 degrees up to four decimal places. I can also go the other direction
4856240	4863280	and convert a decimal number of degrees into degrees minutes and seconds. I'm starting out
4863920	4875840	with 247 degrees, plus a decimal number of degrees left over. If I want to convert 0.3486
4875840	4883440	degrees to minutes, well, I know that I have 60 minutes in one degree. This time I want the
4883440	4890880	minutes on the top and the degrees on the bottom, so that my degrees will cancel. So I just multiply
4890880	4902880	my decimal by 60. And I end up with 20.916 minutes. Let me copy this down. And now I'm going to take
4902880	4912800	the 0.916 minutes and convert those to seconds. So I know that they're 60 seconds in one minute.
4913520	4926640	So canceling my units again, I just multiply by 60, which gives me 54.96 minutes. I can copy this down
4926640	4936000	as is, or I can round off my seconds and get 247 degrees, 20 minutes, and 55 seconds.
4936400	4941520	Converting between different ways of measuring angles is all about unit conversion. To convert
4941520	4948720	between radians and degrees, we use the fact that pi radians corresponds to 180 degrees.
4950480	4957040	To convert between minutes and seconds and degrees, we use the fact that 60 minutes
4957840	4963360	corresponds to one degree, and 60 seconds corresponds to one minute.
4966880	4974880	If you have a circle, a piece of the circumference is called an arc. And
4976000	4984000	a wedge of pi for that circle is called a sector. This video explains how to calculate
4984000	4991360	the length of the arc and the area of the sector in terms of the angle and the radius of the circle.
4992240	4998960	The circumference of a circle is given by the formula, the circumference equals 2 pi
4999600	5007760	times the radius. Let's use that to solve the following problem. A circular pool has a radius
5007760	5016160	of 8 meters. Find the arc length spanned by a central angle of 2.5 radians. So this angle
5016240	5023200	from the center of the circle is supposed to be 2.5 radians. I've drawn the angle as a little bit
5023200	5028960	less than half the circle because half the circle would be pi radians, which is 3.141 radians.
5029760	5037840	So I want to find the length of this arc. I know that the total circumference is going to be 2 pi
5037920	5045760	times 8 meters. But I just want a fraction of the circumference. The arc length I want
5046400	5054720	is going to be given by the fraction of the circle that the angle makes times the circumference of
5054720	5062880	the circle. The fraction of the circle that I want is given by the ratio of 2.5 radians
5063680	5070400	over the total number of radians in the circle, which is 2 pi radians. Multiply that by this
5070400	5077600	circumference, which we said was 2 pi times 8 meters. Notice that the two pies cancel.
5078800	5090560	And I'm left with just 2.5 times 8 meters, which is 10 meters. In general, the arc length that's
5090560	5097360	related to the angle it spans by considering the arc length to be the fraction of the circle
5097360	5104400	you get by taking the angle over the total angle of the circle of 2 pi times the circumference,
5104400	5111360	which is 2 pi r. Since the two pies cancel, as they did in our example, that means that arc length
5112080	5121680	is given by theta times r. Here, r is the radius of the circle. And theta is the angle. It's
5121680	5128960	important to note that theta needs to be measured in radians, not degrees for this to work. That's
5128960	5135840	because when I took this ratio, I was using 2 pi radians for the total measure of the circle. So
5135840	5142160	it's important that theta also be in radians. The area of a circle is given by the formula
5142720	5150160	pi r squared, where r is the radius. Let's use that fact to find the area of the sector of a
5150160	5160720	circle of radius 10 meters that spans an angle of pi over six radians. We know that the total
5160720	5169920	area of the circle is given by pi times 10 meter squared, or 100 pi meter squared.
5171120	5176480	But we just want a fraction of that area to give us the area of our sector.
5177920	5187760	So we want to take the fraction of the circle that the sector makes times the area of the circle.
5188240	5196080	Well, the fraction of the circle is given by the angle of pi or six over the total angle in the
5196080	5205600	whole circle of two pi. And we'll times that by the 100 pi meter squared. That simplifies
5206560	5220400	to 100 pi over 12 meters squared, or 25 thirds pi meters squared. As a decimal, that's 26.18
5221680	5227280	meters squared up to two decimal places. In general, if you want to find the area of a sector,
5228080	5238320	you can take the fraction of the circle that the sector spans out times the area of the circle
5238960	5245920	pi r squared. Notice that the fraction of the circle is given by the angle that the sector makes
5245920	5251120	in radians, divided by the two pi radians in the circle.
5252000	5262720	Since the pies cancel, we can simplify this formula by saying the area is given by theta
5262720	5273120	over two times r squared, where theta is the angle of the sector in radians. Again, it's
5273120	5278560	important that this angle be in radians, since that's how we're doing our fraction of our circle
5278560	5286240	comparison. As usual, r represents the radius of the circle. Notice that if you don't have your
5286240	5291680	angle in radians, if it's in degrees instead, not a big deal, because we can always convert from
5291680	5299280	degrees to radians first, before using our formula. In this video, we saw that for a sector of angle
5299280	5312320	theta given in radians, the arc length is given by the formula theta times r. And the area of the
5312320	5321360	sector is given by theta over two times r squared, where r is the radius of the circle. This video
5321360	5328400	defines linear and radial speed for a rotating circle and explains how to convert between them.
5329720	5339600	Consider a spinning wheel. The angular speed is the angle it goes through in a unit of time. I can
5339600	5349360	write that as angle per time. The units will be something like radians per second, if the angle
5349360	5354880	is measured in radians and the times measured in seconds, or I guess we could do degrees per minute,
5354880	5364880	etc. The linear speed is the speed of a point on the rim of the wheel. So that is the distance
5366320	5374880	a point on the rim of the wheel travels in a unit of time.
5375280	5382800	I can think of that as distance per time. And so it has units of something like meters per second,
5382800	5392880	for example, or it could be feet per minute, etc. Suppose we have a ferrous wheel with radius 20 meters,
5394880	5402320	that's making one revolution every two minutes. We want to find its angular speed and the linear
5402320	5410560	speed of a point on its rim. Now the ferrous wheel is going one revolution every two minutes. So
5410560	5417920	that's one half revolution per minute. I want to I want to find the angular speed, which is the
5417920	5424480	angle it goes through in a unit of time. I've already got a unit of time in the denominator
5424480	5430080	minutes, but I've got to somehow convert revolutions to angle. So my angular speed is
5430640	5438080	one half revolutions per minute. One revolution, I'll put that on the bottom, so the units will
5438080	5447280	cancel out, one revolution is going through an angle of two pi radians. That means my angular speed
5447280	5456640	is going to be one half times two pi radians per minute, or pi radians per minute. So that's
5456720	5465920	the linear speed, the speed of a point on the rim. Well, the wheel is going pi radians per minute.
5466880	5476800	I got to somehow convert radians into distance. So I know that when I go to pi radians, so that's all
5476800	5483360	the way around the circle, I'm going all the way around the circle. So I'm going all the way around
5484000	5488560	the circle, I'm going all the way around the circumference and distance. So that would be
5488560	5499600	two pi times the radius or two pi times 20 meters. The two pies cancel, as do the radians. And I'm
5499600	5509440	left with 20 pi meters per minute. Let's review how we got from angular speed to linear speed in
5509440	5516560	order to get a more general formula. I'll call the angular speed, omega looks like a w, and I'll
5516560	5525120	call the linear speed V. In the previous problem, we found the linear speed V by starting with the
5525120	5534000	angular speed, omega, and multiplying it by the circumference divided by two pi. That's because
5534720	5542240	the point on the rim travels the whole circumference as it goes through an angle of two pi all the way
5542240	5552400	around the circle. So I'll write that down here, circumference over two pi. But since I know that
5552400	5559840	my circumference is given by the formula two pi r, and the two pies cancel, as they did in the
5559840	5567680	previous problem, that shows that the linear speed is the angular speed times r, where r is
5567680	5577200	the radius of the circle. In this video, we defined linear speed and radial speed, and found that
5577200	5584480	linear speed was radial speed times the radius of the circle. This video introduces the trig
5584480	5596320	functions, sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent for right triangles.
5600240	5609040	For a right triangle, with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle theta as drawn, we define
5609360	5620000	sine of theta as the length of the opposite side over the hypotenuse. The side that's opposite to
5620000	5627280	our angle theta has measure a and the hypotenuse is this side here with measure C. So that would be
5628080	5636160	a over C for this triangle. cosine of theta is defined as the length of the adjacent side
5636240	5643200	over the length of hypotenuse. This side here is the side adjacent to theta. Of course, the
5643200	5647360	hypotenuse is also adjacent to theta, but it's special as the hypotenuse. So we don't think of
5647360	5655760	it as the adjacent side. So that would be b over C tangent of theta is the opposite side length
5656320	5664000	over the adjacent side length. So that would be a over b. The mnemonic to remember this
5664720	5677520	is so catoa, that's sine is opposite over hypotenuse, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse,
5678160	5687600	and tangent is opposite over adjacent. In fact, there's a relationship between tangent and sine
5687600	5696720	and cosine, namely, tangent of theta is equal to sine of theta over cosine of theta. If you
5696720	5704640	want to see why that's that's because sine of theta over cosine of theta is given by sine,
5704640	5711440	which is opposite over hypotenuse, divided by cosine, which is adjacent over hypotenuse.
5712320	5717520	If we compute these fractions by flipping and multiplying
5719520	5727680	the hypotenuse length cancels, and we just get opposite over adjacent, which is by definition
5727680	5733920	tangent of theta. There are three more trig functions that are defined in terms of sine,
5733920	5741280	cosine and tangent. First of all, they're secant of theta by definition, that's one over
5741360	5748320	cosine of theta. So it's going to be one over the adjacent over the hypotenuse, which is the
5748320	5754240	hypotenuse over the adjacent, which in this triangle is C over B.
5755920	5763360	cosecant of theta is defined as one over sine theta. So that's one over the opposite
5763360	5769120	over the hypotenuse, which is the hypotenuse over the opposite. And for this triangle,
5769120	5777280	that's going to be C over a. Finally, cotangent of theta is defined as one over tan theta. So
5777280	5784720	that's going to be one over opposite over adjacent, flip and multiply, I get adjacent over
5784720	5794800	opposite for which in this case is B over a. So notice that the values for cotangent,
5794800	5804080	cosecant and secant are the reciprocals of the values for tangent, sine and cosine, respectively.
5805840	5811680	Let's use these definitions to find the exact values of all six trig functions for the angle
5811680	5819440	theta in this triangle. I'll start with sine of theta, that's opposite over hypotenuse.
5820240	5826640	Well, for this angle theta, the opposite side is down here and has measured to the hypotenuse
5826640	5836080	has measure five. So sine theta is two over five. cosine theta is adjacent over hypotenuse,
5836080	5842800	but I don't know the value of this side length. But fortunately, I can find it using Pythagorean
5842800	5848160	theorem. So as I have a right triangle here, I know that a squared, I'll call the this side
5848160	5857040	length a plus b squared, where b is this other leg of the triangle is equal to c squared, where c is
5857040	5863440	the hypotenuse. So here I have a squared plus two squared equals five squared, which means that a
5863440	5872160	squared plus four equals 25, a squared is 21. So a is plus or minus the square root of 21. But
5872160	5876640	since I'm talking about the length of a side of a triangle, I can just use the positive answer.
5877600	5885200	Returning to my computation of cosine theta, I can write it as adjacent, which is the square root
5885200	5895120	of 21 over hypotenuse, which is five. tangent theta is the opposite over the adjacent. So that's
5895120	5905200	going to be two over the square root of 21. To compute secant of theta, that's one over cosine
5905200	5911760	theta. So that's going to be one over square root of 21 over five, which is five over the
5911760	5922240	square root of 21, the reciprocal of my cosine value. cosecant theta is one over sine theta,
5922240	5929120	that's going to be the reciprocal of my sine, so five halves. And cotangent theta is one over
5929120	5936720	tan theta. So it's going to be the reciprocal of my tan value, square root of 21 over two. Finally,
5936720	5944000	we'll do an application. So if we have a kite that's flying at an angle of elevation, that's the
5944000	5953200	angle from the horizontal of 75 degrees, with a kite length string of 100 meters, we want to find
5953200	5963280	out how high it is. I'll call the height y. Well, we want to relate the known quantities, this angle
5963280	5969520	and this hypotenuse, to the unknown quantity. The unknown quantity is the opposite side of our
5969520	5980240	triangle. So if we use sine of theta equals opposite over hypotenuse, then we can relate these known
5980240	5987600	amounts sine of 75 degrees to our unknown amount y, which is the opposite and our known amount of 100
5987600	5996080	meters. solving for why this gives that y is 100 meters times sine of 75 degrees, we can use a
5996080	6003280	calculator to compute sine of 75 degrees, be sure you use degree mode, and not radiant mode,
6004240	6014800	when you type in the 75. When I do the computation, I get a final answer of 96.59 meters up to two
6014800	6020160	decimal places. Notice that we're ignoring the height of the person in this problem.
6020400	6024560	To remember the definitions of the trig functions, you can use the mnemonic
6024560	6032960	Soca Toa, and the fact that secant is the reciprocal of cosine, cosecant the reciprocal of sine,
6032960	6040480	and cotangent the reciprocal of tangent. In this video, I'll use geometry to compute the sine and
6040480	6048960	cosine of a 30 degree angle, a 45 degree angle, and a 60 degree angle. One way to compute the
6049120	6055760	one way to compute the sine of a 45 degree angle is to use a right triangle with a 45 degree angle.
6056400	6060560	This particular right triangle has a hypotenuse of length one.
6062400	6068560	Since all the angles of the triangle have to add up to 180 degrees, and we already have 90 degrees
6068560	6076720	and 45 degrees. The remaining angle must also be 45 degrees. So we have an isosceles triangle
6076800	6083760	with two sides the same length. I'll call that side length a. If we want sine of 45 degrees,
6083760	6090160	let's use this 45 degree angle here, then sine is opposite over hypotenuse. So if I can figure
6090160	6096320	out how long this side length is, I'll be able to compute sine of 45 degrees. Now the Pythagorean
6096320	6101200	theorem says this side length squared plus that side length squared equals the hypotenuse squared.
6101680	6108960	So we have that a squared plus a squared equals one squared. Alright, that is two a squared equals
6108960	6117360	one. So a squared is one half, and a is plus or minus the square root of one half. Since we're
6117360	6121680	talking about the lengths of sides of triangles, I can just use the positive square root.
6123680	6128080	It's customary to rewrite this as the square root of one over the square root of two,
6128880	6133520	which is one over the square root of two, and then rationalize the denominator by multiplying
6133520	6138240	the top and the bottom by the square root of two. That gives me a square root of two in the numerator,
6138880	6143680	and the square root of two squared in the denominator, which is the square root of two over
6143680	6151040	two. So these side lengths are the square root of two over two. Now I can figure out the sine
6151040	6158880	of 45 degrees by computing the opposite over the hypotenuse. That's, I'm looking at this angle,
6158880	6162240	so opposite is square root of two over two, hypotenuse is one.
6166400	6173520	So the sine of 45 degrees is the square root of two over two cosine of 45 degrees is adjacent
6173520	6180160	over hypotenuse. That's this side length over this hypotenuse. So that's the square root of two
6180160	6188320	over two over one again. What would happen if instead of using this triangle with hypotenuse one,
6188320	6195200	we use this triangle, also a 45 45 90 triangle, but with hypotenuse five, not quite drawn to scale.
6196240	6200480	Please pause the video for a moment and repeat the computation with this triangle.
6201840	6208480	This time I'll call the side lengths B, Pythagorean theorem tells me B squared plus B squared equals
6208480	6217120	five squared. So two B squared equals 25. And B squared equals 25 over two. B is going to be
6217760	6222640	the plus or minus the square root of 25 over two. Again, I can just use the positive version.
6223280	6229680	And so B is the square root of 25 over the square root of two, which is five over the square root of
6229680	6238800	two rationalizing the denominator, I get five root two over two. Now sine of my 45 degree angle
6241120	6249040	is opposite over hypotenuse, which is five square root of two over two divided by five.
6249760	6256160	That simplifies to the square root of two over two as before. And a similar computation shows
6256160	6263840	that cosine of 45 degrees is also squared of two over two as before. This makes sense because
6263840	6270320	sine and cosine are based on ratios of sides. And since these two triangles are similar triangles,
6270320	6276960	they'll have the same ratios of sides. To find the sine and cosine of 30 degrees,
6276960	6284480	let's use this 30 60 90 right triangle with hypotenuse one. If we double the triangle
6286400	6294960	we get an angle of 30 here, so a total angle of 60 degrees here. And this angle is also 60 degrees.
6295600	6300960	So we have a 60 60 60 triangle, that's an equilateral triangle, all side lengths are the same.
6302320	6307360	Since this side length has length one. This side length is also one.
6308960	6315440	This entire side length is one, which means the short side of our original triangle has length one
6315440	6322640	half. Going back to my original triangle, let's use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length
6322640	6332560	of its longer side x. Pythagorean theorem says x squared plus one half squared equals one squared.
6332560	6340480	So x squared plus a fourth equals one x squared is three fourths. And so x is plus or minus the
6340480	6346800	square root of three fourths, use the positive version, and get the square root of three over the
6346800	6352960	square root of four, which is the square root of three over two. Now using our original triangle
6352960	6362560	again, let's compute the sine of this 30 degree angle here. We know that sine of 30 degrees is
6362560	6369520	opposite over hypotenuse. The opposite of this angle is one half and the hypotenuse is one.
6371280	6379200	So we get a sine of one half over one, which is one half cosine of 30 degrees is adjacent over
6379200	6387600	hypotenuse. So that's the square root of three over two divided by one. To find sine of 60 degrees
6387600	6393920	and cosine of 60 degrees, we can actually use the same green triangle and just focus on this
6394720	6400320	upper corner angle of 60 degrees instead. So sine of 60 degrees,
6402000	6408400	opposite over hypotenuse, but this time the opposite to this angle is a square root of three over two.
6410880	6418560	Cosine of 60 degrees, adjacent over hypotenuse gives us one half.
6418560	6427120	I'll summarize the results in this table below. Notice that a 30 degree angle corresponds to
6427920	6439040	pi over six radians since 30 degrees times pi over 180 is pi over six. Similarly, 45 degrees
6439040	6444080	corresponds to pi over four radians and 60 degrees corresponds to pi over three radians.
6445040	6452560	I recommend that you memorize the three numbers one half root two over two and root three over two
6453200	6456640	and the fact that one half and root three over two go together.
6458240	6466560	And root two over two goes with itself. From that information, it's not hard to reconstruct
6467200	6474320	the triangles. You know that a 45 45 90 triangle is an isosceles triangle. So it must have
6474320	6480400	the side lengths where the same number goes with itself. And a 30 60 90 triangle
6481840	6488160	has one side length smaller than the other. So the smaller side must be one half and the
6488160	6494160	larger side must be root three over two since root three is bigger than one. And so root three over
6494160	6501760	two is bigger than one half. Doing a visual check, you can easily fill in the angles,
6502400	6507760	the smaller angle must be the 30 degree angle, and the larger one must be the 60 degree one.
6508960	6514960	In this video, we computed the sine and cosine of three special angles, 30 degrees,
6515920	6525840	45 degrees, and 60 degrees. This video defines sine and cosine in terms of points on the unit
6525840	6535040	circle. A unit circle is a circle with radius one. Up to now, we define sine and cosine and tangent
6535040	6541840	in terms of right triangles. For example, to find sine of 14 degrees in theory, you could draw a
6541840	6551680	right triangle with an angle of 14 degrees, and then calculate the sine as the length of the opposite
6551680	6560640	side over the length of the hypotenuse. But if we use this method to try to compute sine of 120
6560640	6569920	degrees, things go horribly wrong. When we draw this 120 degree angle, and this right angle,
6569920	6575600	there's no way to complete this picture to get a right triangle. So instead, we're going to use a
6575600	6583040	unit circle, that is, a circle of radius one. The figure below illustrates how right triangles
6583040	6589120	and the unit circle are related. If you draw right triangles, with larger of hypotenuse one,
6589680	6595600	with larger and larger angles, then the top vertex sweeps out part of a unit circle.
6595920	6602320	Let's look at this relationship in more detail. In this figure, I've drawn a right triangle
6603120	6609920	inside a unit circle. The hypotenuse of the triangle is the radius of the circle, which is one.
6611600	6617200	One vertex of the right triangle is at the origin. Another vertex of the right triangle
6617600	6623600	is at the edge of the circle. I'm going to call the coordinates of that vertex a
6624320	6634560	b. Now the base of this right triangle has length a the x coordinate, and the height of the right
6634560	6644080	triangle is b the y coordinate. If I use the right triangle definition of sine and cosine of theta,
6644640	6653280	this right here is the angle theta, then cosine of theta is adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's
6653360	6664080	a over one, or a. Notice that a also represents the x coordinate of this point on the unit circle
6664640	6672960	at angle theta from the x axis. I'll write that down. For sine of theta, if I use the right triangle
6672960	6684400	definition, that's opposite over hypotenuse. So b over one, which is just b. But b also represents
6684400	6692160	the y coordinate of this point in the on the unit circle at angle theta. For tangent theta,
6692160	6698480	if we use the right sine triangle definition, it's opposite over adjacent. So that's b over a.
6698480	6704160	I can think of that as the y coordinate of the point over the x coordinate of the point.
6705680	6710320	Now for angles theta that can't be part of a right triangle, because they're too big,
6710320	6716960	they're bigger than 90 degrees, like now I'll call this angle here theta. I can still use this
6716960	6726480	idea of x and y coordinates to calculate sine and cosine of theta. So if I just mark this point
6727120	6733200	on the end of this line at angle theta, if I mark that to have coordinates x and y,
6734000	6742240	then cosine theta, I'm still going to define as the x coordinate of this point, sine theta as the y
6742240	6749840	coordinate, and tangent theta as the ratio of the y coordinate over the x coordinate.
6750720	6757280	When we use this unit circle definition, we always draw theta starting from the positive x axis
6758160	6760400	and going counterclockwise.
6763760	6769680	Let's use this unit circle definition to calculate sine cosine and tangent of this angle phi.
6772400	6777280	In our figure, we have a unit circle, and these numbers are supposed to represent the x and y
6777440	6787440	coordinates of this point on the unit circle at the end point of this line segment that lies at
6787440	6799600	angle phi from the positive x axis. Sine phi is equal to the y coordinate. Cosine phi is equal to
6799600	6805840	the x coordinate. And tangent of phi is given by the ratio of the two,
6807280	6812800	which works out to negative 0.3639 up to four decimal places.
6814720	6820560	This video gives a method for calculating sine cosine and tangent in terms of the unit circle.
6821920	6827840	Starting from the positive x axis, you draw the angle theta going counterclockwise.
6830160	6837200	You look at the coordinates of the point on the unit circle where that angle ends.
6839200	6846800	And cosine of that angle theta is the x coordinate, sine of theta is the y coordinate,
6847440	6855120	and tangent of theta is the ratio. This video gives three properties of the trig function
6855200	6858960	sine and cosine that can be deduced from the unit circle definition.
6860240	6866320	Recall that the unit circle definition of sine and cosine for an angle theta
6868000	6875600	is that cosine theta is the x coordinate, and sine of theta is the y coordinate for the point
6875600	6884160	on the unit circle at angle theta. The first property is what I call the periodic property.
6885120	6892320	This says that the values of cosine and sine are periodic with period two pi. And what that means
6892320	6898640	is that if you take cosine of an angle plus two pi, you get the same thing as just if you took
6898640	6906320	cosine of the angle. So when we write this down, we're assuming that theta is measured in radians.
6907760	6913440	If we want to measure theta in degrees, the similar statement is that cosine of theta plus
6913440	6920640	360 degrees is equal to cosine of theta. We can make the same statements for sine,
6921200	6928480	sine of an angle plus two pi is equal to sine of the original angle here, the angle being measured
6928480	6935440	in radians. If we want to measure the angle in degrees, the statement is that sine of theta plus
6935440	6943680	360 is equal to sine of theta. We can see why this is true from the unit circle definition
6943680	6952800	of sine and cosine. This is our angle theta, then theta plus two pi, the plus two pi adds
6953440	6958160	a full turn around the unit circle to our angle. So we end up at the same place.
6958320	6964800	Theta, and theta plus two pi are just two different names for the same location on the unit circle.
6965680	6970640	And since sine and cosine give you the y and x coordinates of that point on the unit circle,
6970640	6978320	they have to have the same value. Similarly, if we consider an angle theta, and an angle theta
6978320	6986240	minus two pi, the minus two pi means we go the other direction around the unit circle, clockwise,
6986640	6992240	clockwise, we still end up in the same place. And therefore, cosine of theta minus two pi,
6992240	6999440	the x coordinate of that position is the same thing as cosine of theta, sine of theta minus two pi
6999440	7005120	is the same thing as sine of theta. The same statements hold if we add or subtract multiples
7005120	7012000	of two pi, for example, cosine of theta plus four pi is still the same thing as cosine of theta.
7012480	7018320	This time, we've just gone two turns around the unit circle and still gotten back to the same place.
7019760	7027360	So if we want to find cosine of five pi, that's the same thing as cosine of pi plus four pi,
7027360	7034960	which is the same thing as cosine of pi. Thinking about the unit circle, pi is halfway around the
7035120	7042640	unit circle. So cosine of pi means the x coordinate of this point right here. Well, that point has
7042640	7050000	coordinates negative one zero. So cosine of pi must be negative one. If I want to take sine of
7050000	7060960	negative 420 degrees, or that sine of negative 360 degrees, minus 60 degrees, which is the same thing
7061440	7069200	which is the same thing as sine of minus 60 degrees. Thinking about the unit circle, minus 60
7069200	7077200	degrees means I start at the positive x axis and go clockwise by 60 degrees. That lands me about
7077200	7084960	right here. And so that's one of the special angles that has an x coordinate of one half,
7085040	7091760	a y coordinate of negative root three over two. And therefore sine of negative 60 is negative
7092480	7097520	root three over two, the y coordinate. The next property I call the even odd property.
7098480	7105040	It says that cosine is an even function, which means that cosine of negative theta is the same
7105040	7113520	thing as cosine of theta. While sine is an odd function, which means that sine of negative theta
7113520	7120480	is the negative of sine of theta. To see why this is true, let's look at an angle theta.
7122080	7128080	And the angle negative theta, a negative angle means you go in the clockwise instead of counter
7128080	7135600	clockwise direction from the positive x axis. The coordinates of this point by definition
7135600	7140080	are cosine theta sine theta, whereas the coordinates of this point
7140320	7145360	are cosine negative theta, sine of negative theta.
7148240	7155760	But by symmetry, these two points have the exact same x coordinate. And therefore cosine of theta
7155760	7162400	must equal cosine of negative theta. While their y coordinates have the same magnitude,
7162400	7165360	but opposite signs, this one's positive and this one's negative.
7165680	7171760	Therefore, sine of negative theta is the negative of sine of theta.
7173280	7176640	Let's figure out if tan of theta is an even or odd function.
7177520	7186720	Well, we know that tan of negative theta tangent by definition is sine over cosine.
7188560	7191840	Well, we know that sine of negative theta is the negative
7192560	7197920	of sine of theta, whereas cosine of negative theta is cosine of theta.
7199120	7208320	Therefore, we're getting negative sine theta over cosine theta, which is negative tan of theta.
7209760	7217280	Since tan of negative theta is the negative of tan of theta, tan theta is an odd function.
7217680	7223600	The last property on this video is the Pythagorean property, which says that cosine of theta squared
7223600	7230880	plus sine of theta squared is equal to one. A lot of times this property is written with the
7230880	7239920	shorthand notation, cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one. But this notation,
7240160	7248640	cosine squared theta just means you take cosine of theta and square it. This property is called the
7248640	7255040	Pythagorean property because it comes from the Pythagorean theorem. Let me draw a right triangle
7255040	7261760	on the unit circle. I'll call this angle theta. So the coordinates of this endpoint here are
7261760	7267440	cosine theta, sine theta. Since this is supposed to be a unit circle,
7268000	7273280	since this is supposed to be a unit circle, the hypotenuse of my right triangle has length one.
7274480	7280880	The base of my right triangle is just cosine theta, same thing as the x coordinate of this point.
7281840	7288720	And the height of my triangle is the y coordinate of the point sine theta. Now the Pythagorean
7288720	7295280	theorem says that this side length squared plus that side length squared equals one squared.
7295520	7301200	Since one squared is the same thing as one, that gives me the Pythagorean property.
7302480	7308080	The Pythagorean property is handy for computing values of cosine given values of sine and vice
7308080	7313920	versa. In this problem, we're told that sine of t is negative two sevenths, and t is an angle that
7313920	7320960	lies in quadrant three. When we say the angle lies in quadrant three, that means the terminal
7320960	7330240	side of the angle lies here in quadrant three. One way to find cosine of t is to use the fact that
7330240	7343280	cosine squared t plus sine squared t is equal to one. That is cosine of t squared plus negative two
7344000	7351440	seventh squared is equal to one. I can write this as cosine of t squared plus four,
7352560	7361120	forty ninths is equal to one. And so cosine of t squared is equal to one minus four forty ninths,
7361120	7368960	which is 45, forty ninths. Taking the square root of both sides, that gives me the cosine t
7368960	7377040	is plus or minus the square root of 45 over 49. That's plus or minus the square root of 45 over
7377040	7383440	seven. Now, since we're in the third quadrant, we know that cosine of t, which represents the x
7383440	7392000	coordinate of this point, must also be negative. Therefore, cosine of t is going to be negative
7392000	7399360	squared of 45 over seven. It's also possible to solve this problem using the Pythagorean
7399360	7406000	theorem for right triangles directly. If we look at the fact that sine of t is negative two sevenths
7406000	7411600	and ignore the negative sign for now, we can think of this information as telling us that we have a
7411600	7418960	right triangle angle theta, whose opposite side is two, and whose hypotenuse is seven.
7419280	7425920	If we call this side here a, then Pythagorean theorem says this a squared plus two squared
7425920	7435200	is seven squared. So a squared plus four is 49. So a squared is 45. And a is plus or minus the
7435200	7441840	square root of 45. Since I'm worrying about a triangle, I'm going to use the positive value.
7442480	7455280	Now, cosine of t is going to be adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's going to be the square root
7455280	7463120	of 45 over seven. Now I go back to thinking about positive and negative signs. And I noticed that
7463120	7469920	since I'm in the third quadrant, my cosine needs to be negative. So I just stick a negative sign in
7470400	7475520	this alternative solution uses many of the same ideas as the previous solution,
7475520	7481360	and ultimately gets us the same answer. This video gives three properties of trig functions.
7482160	7488400	The periodic property, the even odd property, and the Pythagorean property.
7490400	7493200	This video is about the graphs of sine and cosine.
7493360	7500080	I want to graph the functions y equals cosine t and y equals sine t, where t is in radians.
7500800	7507280	I'm going to think of this being the t axis, and this being the y axis. One way to do this is to
7507280	7513600	plot points. So I'll fill in this chart using my knowledge of special angles on the unit circle.
7514880	7518240	These points will be easier to graph if I convert them all to decimals.
7518560	7525840	Now I'll plot the points for cosine and connect the dots to get a graph of y equals cosine t from t
7525840	7533520	equals zero to t equals two pi. To continue the graph for t values less than zero or bigger than
7533520	7539360	two pi, I could plot more points, or I could just use the fact that the cosine values repeat.
7539360	7546640	If I add or subtract two pi to the my angle t, I'll be at the same place on the unit circle,
7546640	7552640	so my cosine will be exactly the same. Therefore, my values of cosine, which are represented by
7552640	7560400	my y values on this graph, repeat themselves. For example, when my t value is two pi plus pi
7560400	7566560	over six about like here, it's cosine is the same as the cosine of just pi over six. So I'll
7567040	7575120	take this dot here and repeat it over here. Similarly, the one t is like two pi plus pi over
7575120	7580480	four, I get the same value of cosine is when it's just pi over four. So this dot is going to repeat.
7581520	7588000	And I can continue repeating all my dots. This one repeats over here at two pi plus say pi over
7588320	7597920	three. And so my whole graph will repeat something like this. It also repeats on this side, something
7597920	7606720	like this. Since subtracting two pi from my t values will also give me the same value of cosine.
7607920	7613760	We can also plot points to get a graph for sine and extend it by repetition.
7614000	7615600	And extend it by repetition.
7617520	7624800	Going forward, I'll usually write the function sine and cosine as y equals cosine of x and y
7624800	7633680	equals sine of x. When I write it this way, notice that x now refers to an angle, while y refers to
7633680	7641200	a value of cosine or sine. That's a different meaning of x and y compared to when we're talking
7642160	7646960	about the unit circle, where x refers to the cosine value and y refers to the sine value.
7648320	7651360	Now let's look at some properties of the graphs of sine and cosine.
7652560	7658000	The first thing you might notice is that the graph of cosine and the graph of sine are super
7658000	7663120	similar to each other. In fact, you can think of the graph of cosine as just being the graph of
7663200	7672080	sine shifted to the left by pi over two. So we can write cosine of x as the sine function
7673120	7682800	of x plus pi over two, since adding pi over two on the inside moves the graph horizontally to the
7682800	7690240	left by pi over two. Or we can think of the graph of sine as being constructed from the
7690240	7695920	graph of cosine by shifting the cosine graph right by pi over two. That means we can write sine
7695920	7703920	of x as equal to cosine of x minus pi over two, since subtracting pi over two on the inside shifts
7703920	7711440	the cosine graph to the right by pi over two. Next, let's look at domain and range. The domain
7711440	7716800	of sine and cosine is all real numbers. I'll write that as negative infinity to infinity,
7716800	7723680	but the range is just from negative one to one. That makes sense, because sine and cosine come
7723680	7730160	from the unit circle. The input values for the domain come from angles. And you can use any
7730160	7734560	number as an angle positive negative as big as you want, just by wrapping a lot of times around
7734560	7740880	the circle. The output values for the range that is the actual values of sine and cosine come from
7740880	7745440	the coordinates on the unit circle. And those coordinates can't be any bigger than one or
7745440	7751600	any smaller than negative one. So that gives us our range. As far as even and odd behavior,
7751600	7757040	you can tell from the graph, here's cosine, that it's symmetric with respect to the y axis. And so
7757040	7762320	it must be even. Whereas the graph of sine is symmetric with respect to the origin and must
7762320	7769920	be odd. The absolute maximum values of these two functions is one and the absolute minimum value
7769920	7777840	is negative one. We can also use the words midline amplitude and period to describe these
7777840	7786000	two functions. The midline is the horizontal line halfway in between the maximum and minimum points.
7786800	7795520	Here, the midline is y equals zero. The amplitude is the vertical distance between a maximum point
7795520	7801120	and the midline. You can also think of the amplitude as the vertical distance between a
7801120	7807360	minimum point and the midline, or as half the vertical distance between a min point and a max
7807360	7815280	point. For the cosine function and sine function, the amplitude is one. A periodic function is a
7815280	7821040	function that repeats at regular horizontal intervals. The horizontal length of the smallest
7821040	7830640	repeating unit is called the period. For y equals cosine of x, the period is two pi. Notice that the
7830640	7837280	period is the horizontal distance between successive peaks, or maximum points, or between
7837280	7847440	successive troughs, or minimum points. Algebraically, we can write cosine of x plus two pi equals cosine
7847440	7856400	of x and sine of x plus two pi equals sine of x to indicate that the functions repeat themselves
7856400	7864640	over an interval of two pi and have a period of two pi. In this video, we graphed y equals cosine of x
7865200	7875360	and y equals sine of x. And observe that they both have a midline at y equals zero, an amplitude
7876240	7879760	of one, and a period of two pi.
7882560	7888560	Sine use of all functions are functions that are related to sine and cosine by transformations,
7889280	7894720	like stretching and shrinking and shifting. This video is about graphing these functions.
7895680	7903120	Let's start by graphing the function y equals three sine of two x. This function is related to
7903120	7909360	the function y equals sine x. So I'll graph that first. Now the three on the outside
7910160	7916880	stretches this graph vertically by a factor of three. While the two on the inside
7917600	7924800	compresses it horizontally by a factor of one half. If instead I want to graph y equals three
7924800	7931520	sine two x plus one, this plus one on the outside shifts everything up by one unit.
7933280	7937120	Let's compare the midline amplitude.
7937840	7945520	And period of our original y equals sine x, our transformed y equals three sine two x and our
7945520	7952240	further transformed y equals three sine two x plus one. The original sign has a midline
7953120	7957600	at y equals zero, an amplitude of one and a period of two pi.
7957600	7964240	For the transformed function, y equals three times sine of two x, the two on the inside
7964240	7971440	shrinks everything horizontally by a factor of one half. So it changes the period of two pi
7972080	7980960	into a period of one half times two pi, which is pi. Since the two on the inside only affects x values
7981120	7986000	and horizontal distances, it doesn't affect the midline, which is a y value, or the amplitude,
7986000	7992320	which is a vertical distance. But the three on the outside does affect these things. Well, in
7992320	7997520	particular, it affects the amplitude, since everything is stretched out vertically by a
7997520	8003840	factor of three, the amplitude of one gets stretched to an amplitude of three. Now,
8004560	8010160	the midline doesn't actually change because multiplying a y value of zero by three is still a y
8010160	8018560	value of zero. Now, on the third function, we've taken the second function and added one on the
8018560	8023760	outside. So that shifts everything up by one. Therefore, instead of having a midline at y equals
8023760	8029760	zero, we now have a midline at y equals zero. So we have a midline at y equals zero, and we
8029760	8035440	therefore, instead of having a midline at y equals zero, we now have a midline at y equals one.
8036560	8041040	The amplitude doesn't change, though, it's still three, because shifting everything up by one doesn't
8041040	8047680	affect the distance between the midline and the and the maximum point. Also, the period is still
8047680	8053280	pi, since the period is a horizontal measure, and adding one on the outside only affects vertical
8053280	8060800	things. Next, let's graph the function y equals three times sine of two times quantity x minus
8060800	8066800	pi over four. This function is very closely related to the first function we graphed on the previous
8066800	8076400	page, that was y equals three sine of two x. In fact, if we give the name f of x to that function,
8076960	8086880	and maybe we can call g of x, this other function, then we can get g of x by taking f of x and
8086880	8097280	plugging in x minus pi over four in prex. In other words, g of x is f of x minus pi over four.
8098720	8104720	This relationship gives me an idea for graphing g of x the function we want to graph. We can first
8105360	8111520	graph f of x, we already did that on the previous page, and then we can shift its graph
8113360	8121440	to the right by pi over four, because that's what you do when you subtract a number on the
8121440	8129600	inside of a function. So here's the graph of y equals three sine two x. Recall that it's just
8129600	8135040	the graph of sine stretched vertically by a factor of three and shrunk horizontally by a factor of
8135040	8142560	one half. Now to graph the function that I want, I'm going to shift this graph over by pi over four
8142560	8149760	to the right. Notice that since I had my function written in factored form, I could just read off
8149840	8160880	the horizontal shift. But if I had written it instead, as y equals three sine two x minus pi
8160880	8167440	over two, which is algebraically equivalent, it would be easy to get confused and think that I
8167440	8175600	needed to shift over by pi over two. So it's best to factor first before figuring out what the shift
8175600	8181440	is, we're factoring out the coefficient of x. If instead we wanted to graph this function,
8182080	8186880	same as the one we just graphed, it's just with a minus one on the outside, that minus one would
8186880	8197120	just bring everything down by one. Let's take a moment to look at midline amplitude and period
8198080	8205440	for the original parent function y equals sine of x, and our final transformed function
8205440	8211360	y equals three sine of two times quantity x minus pi over four minus one.
8212400	8218640	Our original sine function has midline at y equals zero amplitude of one and period of two pi.
8218880	8226480	For our transformed function, the three on the outside stretches vertically, so it makes the
8226480	8237040	amplitude three. The minus one on the outside shifts everything down by one. So it brings the
8237040	8245920	midline y equals zero down to y equals negative one. The two on the inside,
8246800	8254480	shrinks everything horizontally by a factor of one half. So the period becomes one half times two
8254480	8260560	pi, which is pi. Finally, there's a horizontal shift going on.
8263840	8272560	Our transformed function shifts to the right by pi over four. This horizontal shift is sometimes
8272560	8284080	called the phase shift. The function we just analyzed was y equals three sine two x minus
8284080	8293360	pi over four minus one, which could also be written as y equals three sine two x minus pi over two
8293920	8301520	minus one. This is a function of the form y equals a sine b x minus c plus D,
8302320	8308560	where B is positive. If we have a function of this form or the similar function with cosine in it,
8309440	8318240	then we know that the midline is going to be at y equals D. That's because the original midline of
8318240	8326960	sine or cosine at y equals zero gets shifted up by D. We know that the amplitude is going to be
8327760	8334400	a because this a multiplied on the outside stretches everything vertically by a factor of a
8335920	8340000	to be a little more accurate, we should say the amplitude is the absolute value of a
8340000	8346720	in case a is negative. If a is negative, then that amounts to a vertical reflection or reflection
8346720	8354800	over the x axis. We know that the period of the original sine or cosine is two pi. And we know
8354800	8362880	that this factor of B amounts to a horizontal shrink by a factor of one over B, or I guess it
8362880	8369520	could be a horizontal stretch by a factor of one over B, if B is less than one. So because we're
8369520	8377520	starting with a period of two pi, and we're multiplying by one over B, our new period is going
8377520	8386880	to be two pi over B. The trickiest thing is the horizontal shift. And to get that right, I like
8386880	8397200	to factor out this B for my equation. So instead of writing y equals a cosine b x minus c plus D,
8397280	8405360	I'm going to write y equals a cosine B times quantity x minus C over B plus D. Similarly,
8405360	8411920	if it's a sine function, I write y equals a sine B times x minus quantity C over B plus D.
8412960	8421120	Then I can read off the horizontal shift as C over B. And that'll be a shift to the right
8421120	8426560	if C over B is positive and a shift to the left if C over B is negative. This might seem backwards
8426560	8429920	from what you're used to, but it's because we have that minus sign there. So if C over B is
8429920	8435440	positive, we're actually subtracting on the inside. So that shifts right, if C of B over B is negative,
8435440	8439120	minus a negative is actually adding something. And that's why it shifts it to the left.
8440000	8449440	So as one final example, say I wanted to graph y equals one third cosine of one half x plus
8450240	8462400	three minus five, that would have a midline at y equals minus five, an amplitude of one third,
8463120	8473520	a period of two pi divided by one half, which is four pi, and a horizontal shift.
8474160	8483440	Hmm, better rewrite this. A horizontal shift of six units to the left.
8485440	8489200	The horizontal shift is sometimes called the phase shift.
8492160	8494640	And that's all for graphs of sine and swivel functions.
8496080	8501920	This video is about graphing the trig functions tangent, secant, cotangent and cosecant.
8502160	8510080	To gain an intuition for the graph of y equals tangent of x, I think it's handy to look at
8510080	8519680	the slope of a line at angle theta on the unit circle. The slope of this line is the rise over
8519680	8530000	the run. But the rise is given by sine of theta. And the run is given by cosine of theta. So the
8530000	8541440	slope is given by sine theta over cosine theta, which is simply tan of theta. So if I want to graph
8541440	8551520	y equals tan of x, I can think of x as being the angle and y as being the slope of the line
8552480	8565520	at that angle. Notice that if the angle is zero, the slope is zero. But as the angle increases
8566640	8572480	towards pi over two, the slope gets bigger and bigger heading towards infinity.
8572480	8583520	As the angle goes from zero towards negative pi over two, the slope is getting negative
8583520	8590240	and heading towards negative infinity. At exactly pi over two and negative pi over two,
8591040	8596240	we have a vertical line. And so the slope is undefined.
8596240	8605040	Using this information, let's graph a rough sketch of y equals tan x. Remember, we're thinking of x
8605040	8613760	as the angle and y as the slope, we're going to go between an angle of negative pi over two and pi over
8613760	8622800	two. So we said that the slope was zero, when the angle is zero, and then it heads up towards
8623360	8629120	positive infinity as we go towards the angle goes towards pi over two with an undefined value
8629120	8635040	at pi over two, it goes negative heading towards negative infinity as the angle heads towards
8635040	8641760	negative pi over two, also with an undefined value at negative pi over two. You can also verify
8642400	8647600	that for angles slightly bigger than pi over two, we have the same line
8648000	8656240	as for angles that are approaching negative pi over two. And therefore, this picture repeats.
8660320	8663120	And it turns out that tangent is periodic
8666160	8666960	with period
8669440	8676480	not two pi like sine and cosine, but just pi. The period of pi makes sense because if you take
8676480	8683600	a line and rotate it by 180 degrees, it's the same line with the same slope and therefore has the
8683600	8692080	same value of tangent. In this graph of y equals tan x, notice that the x intercepts
8693840	8703520	are at values of x of the form negative two pi negative pi zero pi two pi, etc.
8704400	8713680	You can write that as pi times k, where k is an integer, that is a positive or negative
8713680	8722880	whole number or zero. This makes a lot of sense because tangent of x is sine of x over cosine
8722880	8729200	of x. And so you're going to get x intercepts. That's where y is zero, which is where the
8729200	8739760	numerator is zero. And sine x is zero at values of the form pi to pi, and so on.
8741440	8746240	From the graph, you can see the vertical asymptotes are at values like negative three pi over two,
8746960	8753920	negative pi over two, pi over two, and three pi over two. These values can be written as
8753920	8762880	pi over two times k, where k is an odd integer. Again, this makes sense from the definition
8762880	8769360	of tangent since the vertical asymptotes will occur where the denominator is zero and cosine x is
8769360	8778000	zero at numbers like negative pi over two, pi over two, three pi over two, and so on. The domain of
8778000	8782720	tangent is the exact case for which it's defined. So that's going to be everything except for the
8782720	8790720	vertical asymptotes, we can write that as x such that x is not equal to pi over two times k for k
8790720	8799120	and odd integer. The range or the y values go all the way from negative infinity to infinity.
8799840	8807360	And the period as we mentioned previously is pi. Since the smallest repeating unit
8808240	8817120	has a horizontal width of pi. To graph y equals secant x, I'm going to remember that secant
8817680	8826960	is one over cosine. So if I start with a graph of cosine, I can take the reciprocal of the y values
8826960	8835200	to get the graph of secant. The reciprocal of one is one, the reciprocal of zero is undefined. So
8835200	8843520	I'm not going to have a value at pi over two, negative pi over two, three pi over two, or negative
8843520	8849440	three pi over two. When I take the reciprocal of numbers, just less than one, I'm going to get
8849440	8855280	numbers just greater than one. But if I take the reciprocal of positive numbers, getting close to
8855280	8863280	zero, I'm going to get really big positive numbers going up towards infinity. Similarly, on the other
8863280	8871600	side. Over here, I have numbers close to zero but negative. So their reciprocals will be negative
8871600	8878000	numbers heading towards negative infinity. The reciprocal of negative one is negative one.
8878000	8884640	And similarly here. So I'm getting kind of positive and negative buckets and upside down
8884640	8894960	buckets as the graph of my secant. Notice that secant has a period of two pi, which makes sense
8894960	8902000	since cosine has a period of two pi. It has a range that goes from negative infinity to negative one
8902000	8908080	inclusive. And from one to infinity, that makes sense because the range of cosine is between
8908720	8914960	one and negative one. And we're taking the reciprocal of those values. The domain is everything
8914960	8919440	except for the vertical asymptotes. Now the vertical asymptotes are where cosine is zero.
8923600	8932960	So that is at values of the form pi over two, three pi over two, etc. That's values of the form
8932960	8943360	pi over two k, where k is an odd integer. So the domain is going to be x values such that x is not
8943360	8954080	equal to pi over two k, for k, an odd integer. The x intercepts of secant, well, it doesn't have any,
8954640	8960160	because you can't take one over something and get the number zero for your y value.
8962960	8973040	We've seen the graphs of y equals tan x, and y equals secant x. This is the graph of y equals
8973040	8979520	cotangent x. It looks similar to the graph of tangent x is just a decreasing function instead
8979520	8986640	of an increasing one, and it has its vertical asymptotes, and its x intercepts in different places.
8986640	8997120	Finally, this green graph is the graph of y equals cosecant x. It's related to the graph
8997120	9005120	of sine x since cosecant is one over sine x. And in fact, if I draw the graph of sine x in between,
9005120	9009440	you can see how it kind of bounces off because it's the reciprocal.
9011760	9016080	I encourage you to memorize the general shape of these graphs. You can always figure out the
9016080	9026720	details by thinking about how they're related to the graphs of cosine of x and sine x.
9029520	9036640	This video is about the graphs of transformations of tangent secant cotangent cosecant. Before I
9036640	9044000	graph this fancy function, I'm going to graph the related parent function y equals cosecant of x.
9044240	9054080	Recall that cosecant of x is one over sine of x. So the graph of cosecant of x has a vertical
9054080	9064480	asymptotes where sine of x is zero. That puts the vertical asymptotes at pi to pi, zero, and so on.
9065200	9073520	Cosecant of x is one where sine is one. So here. And so it looks something like this.
9074560	9081280	Now, when I graph my fancy function, I know that the two on the outside does a vertical stretch
9081680	9095280	by two, the plus one shifts up by one. The pi means everything shrinks horizontally
9097120	9104080	by one over pi. And so the period, instead of being two pi, like it is for cosecant,
9104080	9112880	it's going to be two pi divided by pi, which is two. Finally, this pi over two has to do with a
9112880	9119280	horizontal shift. But in order to see by how much we horizontal shift, we need to factor out the pi
9119280	9129360	first. So if I rewrite my function as two times cosecant pi times x plus a half plus one, I can
9129360	9136400	see that the horizontal shift is one half to the left. Let me do those transformations in pieces.
9136400	9143280	First, I'll do the vertical motions. So I'll leave the horizontal axis as is. I'll stretch by a factor
9143280	9151680	of two. And now I'll shift up by one. Next, I'll worry about the horizontal motion. Instead of a
9151680	9158640	period of two pi, I'm going to have a period of two. But in addition, everything is going to be
9158640	9167120	shifted left by one half. So instead of having my vertical asymptotes at zero pi, two pi, and so on,
9167120	9180800	they would be at zero, one, two, and so on, except everything's shifted over by one half. So that
9180800	9191200	means the vertical asymptotes will actually be at negative a half, a half, one and a half, and so
9191200	9201920	on. Another way to find the vertical asymptotes is by noting that cosecant is one over a sign. So
9201920	9217760	therefore, cosecant pi x plus one half does not exist when sine pi x plus one half equals zero,
9218480	9231120	i.e. when pi times x plus one half is equal to a multiple of pi. Canceling the pies and solving
9231120	9242640	for x, that's when x is some number minus a half. So those are exactly the values of say one half,
9242640	9248320	three halves, five halves, and so on that we've drawn. So once we've got the vertical asymptotes in
9248320	9257120	place, we can see that our graph fits in between them. This purple piece got shrunk horizontally
9257120	9263200	and shifted by a half. So it ends up hugging the x axis. I'll draw it in right here.
9265120	9271680	And all the other pieces also get shrunk horizontally and shifted. So my final graph
9271680	9280560	looks something like this. In this next problem, we're given the graph and we need to find the
9280560	9287440	equation. The shape of the graph and the fact that it's increasing tells us it must be a tangent
9287440	9299120	graph. But y equals tan x by itself would have a period of pi. Let's check what our graph has a
9299120	9306640	period of. We need to find the horizontal width of one complete cycle. It's probably easiest to
9306640	9313680	measure if I sketch in the vertical asymptotes, which seem to run from an x value of negative three
9313680	9321120	to an x value of one. So that's a horizontal distance of four. So our graph might be something
9321120	9335440	more like tan of b x, where pi over b has to be four. That means that pi equals four b. And so b is
9335440	9342880	pi over four. So our graph is probably more closely related to y equals tan of pi over four x.
9343840	9352320	But if it were exactly y equals tan of pi over four x, then that middle point right here would be at
9352320	9360720	the origin. And instead, that middle point is at negative one one. That means my tangent graph is
9360880	9372480	is shifted left by one and up by one. The left by one I can accomplish by writing x plus one,
9373280	9380080	when I have the pi over four factored out the up by one, I get by writing a plus one on the outside.
9381280	9387360	Now, it's possible there might also be a vertical stretch factor out front. An easy way to check for
9387360	9393920	that is by plugging in x equals zero, and seeing whether what kind of number out in front I might
9393920	9403040	need to get this y intercept of two. So I'm going to write y equals a tan pi over four quantity x plus
9403040	9416720	one plus one, plug in the point zero two. So that's two equals a tan pi over four zero plus one plus
9416720	9428160	one. And I can solve for a since tan of pi over four is just one, this equation simplifies to two
9428160	9436320	equals a times one plus one, which means that a has to be one. So in fact, this equation here is our
9436320	9445040	final answer for this graph. To summarize, if we have a function of the form y equals a tan bx minus
9445040	9457680	c plus D, the number a accomplishes a vertical stretch. The number B changes the period
9457920	9475920	from pi to pi over B, the number D shifts vertically by D. And finally, to figure out what the number C
9475920	9485600	is, we have to rewrite our equation in factored form factoring out the B. And so we see that there's
9486320	9498400	a phase shift right by C over B. The same things hold if instead of tangent, we have a graph of
9498400	9506400	cotangent. We can say the same things for a graph of secant and a graph of cosecant. The only thing
9506400	9519200	to be careful of is that B now changes the period from two pi to two pi over B, simply because the
9519200	9533440	original period of secant and cosecant is two pi, whereas the original period of tan and cotan is just
9533440	9541040	pi. If you know what the original graphs of tan secant cotangent and cosecant look like, you can
9541040	9548800	use your knowledge of transformations to graph more complicated functions. This video defines the
9548800	9559760	standard inverse trig functions, sine inverse, cosine inverse, and tan inverse. In this crazy
9559760	9565440	looking graph, please focus first on the thin black line. This is a graph of y equals sine x.
9566720	9572240	The graph of the inverse of a function can be found by flipping the graph of the original function
9572240	9578320	over the line y equals x. I've drawn the flipped graph with this blue dotted line.
9579760	9584400	But you'll notice that the blue dotted line is not the graph of a function because it violates the
9584480	9592080	vertical line test. So in order to get a function that's the inverse of y equals sine x, we need to
9592080	9599840	restrict the domain of sine of x. We'll restrict it to this piece that's drawn with a thick black line.
9600480	9606160	If I invert that piece by flipping it over the line y equals x, I get the piece drawn
9606160	9612240	with a red dotted line here. And that piece does satisfy the vertical line test. So it is in fact
9612240	9619920	a function. Although regular sine x has domain from negative infinity to infinity, our restricted
9619920	9630480	sine x has domain from negative pi over two to pi over two. It's, it's range is still from negative
9630480	9636240	one to one, just like the regular sine x, because I've taken the biggest possible piece
9636240	9643040	of the graph, whose flipped version is still a function. The inverse sine function
9645040	9652320	is often written as arc sine of x. And since inverting a function reverses the roles of y and x,
9652880	9660320	it reverses the domain and the range. So arc sine of x, the inverse function has domain
9660320	9665120	from negative one to one and range from negative pi over two to pi over two,
9666320	9672720	which seems plausible from the graph. Now an inverse function undoes the work of a function.
9673920	9679200	So if the function sine takes angles theta to numbers x,
9682000	9688640	then the inverse sine or arc sine takes numbers x to angles theta.
9691280	9698640	For example, since sine of pi over two is one arc sine of one is pi over two.
9700480	9707520	And in general, the output of arc sine of x is the angle between negative pi over two and pi over
9707520	9719120	two, whose sine is x. y is equal to arc sine x means that x is equal to sine of y. But since
9719120	9725040	there are many angles y whose sine is x, right, they all differ by multiples of two pi, we specify
9725040	9733120	also that y is between negative pi over two and pi over two. That was the whole point of doing this
9733120	9740400	domain restriction in order to get a well defined inverse value. There's an alternate notation
9740400	9744800	for inverse sine. Sometimes it's written as sine to the negative one of x.
9745200	9755280	But this notation can be confusing. So be careful. In particular, sine to the negative one of x
9755280	9763760	does not equal one over sine of x. One over sine of x, the reciprocal function is another word for
9763760	9772160	cosecant of x. But sine to the negative one of x is another word for arc sine of x, the inverse
9773040	9775920	which is not the same thing as the reciprocal function.
9778960	9782240	Let's go through the same process to build an inverse cosine function.
9782960	9790400	We start with a graph of cosine of x. We flip it over the line y equals x to get the blue dotted
9790400	9796160	line. But the blue dotted line is not a function. So we go back and restrict the domain for our
9796160	9804800	original cosine of x to just be between zero and pi. The resulting red graph now satisfies the
9804800	9810960	vertical line test. So it's a proper inverse function. Our restricted cosine has domain from
9810960	9820880	zero to pi and range from negative one to one. And so our inverse function arc cosine has domain
9820880	9829600	from negative one to one and range from zero to pi. Since cosine takes us from angles to numbers,
9831040	9840240	arc cosine takes us from numbers back to angles. For example, cosine of pi over four is a square
9840560	9847520	root of two over two. So arc cosine of the square root of two over two is equal to pi over four.
9850000	9857680	Arc cosine of x is the angle between zero and pi whose cosine is x.
9859520	9866160	In other words, y equals arc cosine of x means that x is equal to cosine of y.
9866880	9874720	And y is between zero and pi. Since otherwise there'd be lots of possible answers for an angle y
9874720	9881200	whose cosine is x. The alternative notation for arc cosine is cosine inverse.
9883040	9890000	And again, we have to be careful. Cosine to the negative one x is not the same thing
9890000	9895520	as one over cosine of x. One over cosine of x is also called secant of x.
9896800	9903920	Cosine to the negative one x means arc cosine, the inverse function, and these two things are not the
9903920	9913920	same. Finally, let's take a look at inverse tangent function. Here's a graph of tangent
9914640	9919920	in black, these vertical lines aren't really part of the function, they're just vertical asymptotes.
9920880	9926640	So in order to get an actual function, when we flip over the line y equals x,
9927520	9932960	we take just one piece of the tangent function. Here we've taken the piece marked in black.
9933920	9940800	When we flip that over the line y equals x, we get this piece in red, which is actually a function
9940800	9947280	because it satisfies the vertical line test. Now you might ask, would it be possible to pick
9947280	9954240	a different piece of the tangent function to invert? And the answer is yes, we could do that.
9954240	9960000	And on another planet, maybe mathematicians do that. But on our planet, we use the convention
9960000	9967280	that we pick this piece of tangent to invert, which is kind of a convenient choice since it's
9967840	9974160	centered here around the origin. In the previous two examples, our choice of restricted domain for
9974160	9979680	sine and per cosine was also a convention that led to a conveniently defined inverse function.
9981360	9988240	In any case, based on our choice, our restricted tan function has domain from negative pi over two
9988880	9994960	to pi over two. We don't include the endpoints in that interval, because our restricted tan
9994960	10000640	function has vertical asymptotes at negative pi over two, pi over two, so it's not defined there.
10002320	10007520	The range of our restricted tan function is from negative infinity to infinity.
10009280	10016640	Therefore, arc tan of x has domain from negative infinity to infinity and range
10016640	10024400	from negative pi over two to pi over two. Once again, tangent is taking us from angles
10024400	10034560	to numbers. So arc tan is taking us from numbers to angles. For example, tangent of pi over four
10035200	10047840	is one. And therefore arc tan of one is pi over four. So arc tan of x means the angle between
10047840	10058960	negative pi over two and pi over two, whose tangent is x. y is equal to arc tan x means that x is
10058960	10068080	equal to tangent of y. And that y is between negative pi over two and pi over two.
10070800	10078560	The inverse tan function can also be written as tan to the minus one of x. And once again,
10079520	10093600	tan inverse of x means the inverse trig function arc tan of x. And it's not equal to one over
10093600	10097440	tan of x, which is called cotangent of x.
10101760	10105680	And that's all for this video on the three basic inverse trig functions.
10106560	10114960	Sin inverse x, also known as arc sine of x, cosine inverse x, also known as arc cosine x and tan
10114960	10123200	inverse x, also known as arc tan x. This video is an introduction to solving trig equations.
10124640	10130560	Let's start with the equation to cosine x plus one equals zero. I want to find all the solutions
10130560	10136480	in the interval from zero to two pi, and then get a general formula for all solutions, not just
10136480	10144000	those in that interval. Let me start by rewriting this equation to isolate the tricky part, which is
10144000	10153040	cosine of x. So I'm going to write two cosine x equals negative one, and then divide both sides
10153040	10161760	by two. Now I'm looking for the angles x between zero and two pi, whose cosine is negative one half.
10163840	10167520	Since negative one half is one of the special values on the unit circle,
10169280	10175760	I can use my knowledge of the unit circle to see that the angle between zero and two pi
10176480	10186160	must be either two pi over three, or four pi over three. My answer needs to include both of these
10186160	10192960	values. There are no other spots on the unit circle whose cosine is negative one half. But there are
10192960	10198720	more angles, because we can always take one of these angles and add multiples of two pi to it.
10199280	10204160	So if I want to find all solutions, I can take these two principle solutions,
10204960	10211200	two pi over three, and four pi over three, and simply add multiples of two pi to them.
10212000	10220000	For example, two pi over three plus two pi or two pi over three minus two pi, two pi over three plus
10220000	10229760	four pi, and so on. A much more efficient way to write this is to write two pi over three plus
10230480	10240320	two pi times K, for K, any integer, that is any positive or negative whole number or zero.
10241280	10245680	Similarly, I can write four pi over three plus two pi K
10247600	10252480	to capture all solutions based on the principle solution four pi over three by adding and
10252480	10256960	subtracting multiples of two pi. This is my final solution.
10260560	10266720	Next, let's look at a Triggy equation involving tangent. As usual, I'm going to start out by
10266720	10270560	cleaning things up and isolating the tricky part, which in this case is tangent.
10271200	10282000	So let me add tangent to both sides. That'll give me three tan x equals the square root of three.
10282000	10288880	And so tan x is the square root of three over three. The square root of three over three looks
10288880	10294480	suspiciously similar to value the value of square root of three over two, which is a special value
10294480	10301120	on my unit circle. So my suspicion is that my unit circle will again help me find this value of x
10301120	10312320	without a calculator. Recall that tan x is sine x over cosine x. So I'm looking for angles on the
10312320	10317440	unit circle between zero and two pi, where the ratio of sine over cosine will give me
10318240	10325040	square root of three over three. I actually only need to look in the first quadrant and the third
10325040	10330960	quadrant, because those are the quadrants where tangent is positive. And I really only need to
10330960	10339280	look at angles whose either sine or cosine has a square root of three in it. So by trial and error,
10339280	10350720	I can see that tan pi over six, which is sine pi over six over cosine pi over six,
10351600	10358880	will give me one half over root three over two. That's the same thing as one half times two over
10358880	10365760	root three, which is one over root three. If I rationalize that, I get root three over three.
10365760	10372720	So that value works. If I try tan of pi over three instead,
10374400	10380560	I get root three, which is not equal to root three over three. So pi over three doesn't work.
10381360	10390080	Similarly, I can work out some the values in the third quadrant, and see that seven pi over six
10390080	10399280	works. But four pi over three does not. So my answer to part a includes just the two values,
10400400	10409440	pi over six, and seven pi over six. Now, if I want to find all solutions, not just those
10409440	10414880	in the interval from zero to two pi, I noticed that I can take one of these principal solutions,
10415440	10419440	and add multiples of two pi to it, because that'll give me the same angle.
10421040	10432320	So I get pi over six plus two pi k, and pi over six, sorry, seven pi over six plus two pi k for
10433440	10441280	k, any integer. This is a correct answer, but it's not as simple as it could be.
10442240	10449440	Notice that seven pi over six over here on the unit circle is exactly pi more than pi over six.
10449440	10454000	So instead of taking both of these and adding multiples of two pi to them,
10454000	10459280	I could get all the same answers by just taking one of them and adding multiples of pi to it.
10461040	10468320	So a more efficient answer is to say that x equals pi over six plus pi times k
10469200	10476960	for k, any integer. This will still capture all the same solutions, because when k is even,
10477600	10483680	I'll get this family of solutions. And when k is odd, I'll get this family. For example, when k is one,
10485200	10489840	pi over six plus one times pi is just the original seven pi over six.
10491360	10497360	If you think about the fact that tangent has a period of pi, instead of two pi, it makes a lot
10497360	10503920	of sense that you should be able to write the solutions in this form. In this video,
10503920	10513360	we solved basic trig equations by first isolating sine or tangent, or the same thing would work
10513360	10522080	with cosine, and then using the unit circle to find principal solutions.
10523040	10528640	Principal solutions are just solutions between zero and two pi.
10530480	10540160	And then adding multiples of two pi to these principal solutions to get all solutions.
10541520	10545840	For tangent, we notice that it was equivalent to just use one principal solution
10545840	10553840	and add multiples of pi instead of two pi. In a previous video, we looked at trig equations
10553840	10559520	that could be solved using the unit circle. In this video, we'll solve trig equations that
10559520	10564720	don't involve special values on the unit circle, and require a calculator instead to solve.
10566480	10570800	Let's look at the equation to cosine t equals one minus cosine t.
10571040	10577280	As usual, I'll start by simplifying and isolating cosine. Adding cosine to both sides, I get three
10577280	10586160	cosine t equals one, dividing by three gives cosine t equals one third. Now, one third is not one of
10586160	10594640	my special values on the unit circle. But I can locate it approximately, cosine represents the x
10594640	10599920	value of a point on the unit circle. So I'm looking for a point on the universe circle whose x
10600880	10608160	coordinate is approximately one third. So maybe right here, and the symmetric angle right here,
10608160	10614000	those are angles in the first and fourth quadrants. To get a decimal approximation
10614000	10618560	for one of these angles, I can take our cosine of both sides of my equation.
10620240	10627680	This gives me t equals our cosine of one third, which using my calculator on radian mode,
10627760	10635920	I get a decimal approximation of 1.2310 up to four decimal places. It's important to use
10635920	10643920	radian mode here. Since by convention, the answers to trig equations are expected to be in radians
10643920	10651280	unless otherwise specified. It's also important to notice that these two equations are not precisely
10651280	10657920	the same thing. Since cosine t equals one third has infinitely many solutions.
10659360	10663760	If we don't restrict to a certain interval, and even if we restrict to the interval zero to two
10663760	10671680	pi, it still has two different solutions. On the other hand, our t equals our cosine of one third
10672320	10681520	has only one solution. And that solution lies between the angles of zero and pi.
10682880	10689600	So this angle here, the 1.2310 radians must be giving us this angle, since it's got to be an
10689600	10696560	angle between zero and pi. And to get the other angle, this one, we can use the symmetry of the
10696560	10704320	situation. This angle and this angle are the same size. So to get all the way around to here,
10704320	10713280	we can go all the way to pi minus our 1.2310 radians. Using our calculator again, we can compute
10713280	10725280	that two pi minus 1.2310 radians is equal to 5.0522 radians. So our two solutions on our interval
10725280	10737600	from zero to two pi are given by 1.2310 and 5.0522 radians. Let me emphasize that we found the
10737600	10748560	second solution by taking two pi minus the first solution. Now it's straightforward to find all
10748560	10755280	solutions. We can just take our two principal solutions and add multiples of two pi.
10757520	10760320	It could be helpful to look at this solution graphically.
10761360	10768160	To solve our equation cosine t equals one third, we want to know where this graph
10769440	10776000	of y equals cosine of t intersects the horizontal line at y equals one third.
10776000	10784640	This intersection point here corresponds to our first solution of 1.2310 radians.
10785600	10792480	This intersection point here corresponds to our second solution. Notice that it occurs at a t
10792480	10801920	value that's two pi minus this t value here. And all the other intersection points correspond to
10801920	10810160	those first two intersection points shifted over by multiples of two pi. Next, let's look at the
10810160	10820320	equation for sine x minus one equals two. I'll start by rewriting this as four sine x equals three,
10820320	10827040	which is equivalent to sine x equals three fourths. Although three fourths is not a special value on
10827040	10832320	the unit circle, we can still use the unit circle to get oriented and see how many solutions
10832320	10838320	there should be in the interval from zero to two pi. Since sine represents the y coordinate of a
10838320	10842720	point on the unit circle, we're looking for points on the unit circle whose y coordinate is three
10842720	10848240	fourths. So that might be three fourths might be about here. So that would be an angle about right
10848240	10857680	here, and about right here. So in the first and second quadrants. Let's take the arc sine of both
10857680	10866400	sides to find one of those angles. I'm getting one of the angles to be arc sine of three fourths,
10866400	10876560	which my calculator says is 0.8481 radians. That must be this angle here. To get the other angle,
10876560	10886560	I can use symmetry. Since this angle here, you can get by going a full pi minus my previous angle.
10888000	10896160	Pi minus 0.8481 is equal to 2.2935. So that's my second angle.
10898000	10905040	Notice that this time, to get the second angle, we use pi minus the first angle.
10905200	10911440	Not to pi minus the first angle, like we did for cosine. Once again, we can find all solutions
10911440	10918960	simply by adding multiples of two pi. We can also locate these solutions on a graph of sine.
10919920	10928000	We're looking for where the graph of y equals sine of x intersects with the horizontal line at y
10928800	10934320	equals three fourths. And we can see that we have these two solutions.
10937520	10944880	Where the second one, its x value is pi minus the x value of this one. And then we have all these
10944880	10951520	additional solutions that we can get by shifting over by positive and negative multiples of two
10951520	10957760	pi from the first two. Finally, let's solve the equation tan x equals four.
10959280	10963280	If we simply take x to be tan inverse of four,
10965120	10970800	which is 1.3258 radians, we'll get a single solution.
10972800	10979680	But thinking about the graph of tangent and intersecting that graph with the horizontal
10979680	10989760	line y equals four, we see that there should actually be two solutions in the interval from zero
10989760	10996240	to two pi. This makes sense because the period of tangent is pi.
10998240	11006000	So any one solution will get repeated by intervals of pi. It also makes sense by thinking about the
11006000	11014880	unit circle tangent, which can be thought of as the slope of a line at angle theta takes on all
11014880	11021440	positive real values, both in the first quadrant and the third quadrant. So there are going to be
11021440	11028080	two places on the unit circle where the tangent is four. We've already found this one.
11029200	11031760	To find the other one, we just need to add pi.
11031760	11039360	This gives us our answer for the interval zero to two pi, and we can add multiples of two pi to get all
11039360	11045280	other solutions. Or if we want to be more efficient, we can just write the first solution
11047280	11053600	plus multiples of pi instead of two pi. Because these two solutions differ by exactly pi,
11055120	11061360	taking the first solution and then adding multiples of pi will capture all solutions,
11061440	11064240	corresponding to both of these principle solutions.
11066400	11075840	To summarize, to find all solutions to cosine t equals m, we need to find first cosine inverse of m,
11077520	11084880	then take two pi minus this solution and add multiples of two pi to both of those.
11085840	11094480	To find solutions to the equation, sine t equals n, we can start by taking sine inverse of n,
11095440	11100480	using pi minus this, and adding multiples of two pi.
11102640	11111840	To find all solutions to tangent t equals p, we can take t equal tan inverse of p and
11112240	11122160	tan inverse of p plus pi and add multiples of two pi. Or we can just take tan inverse of p
11122160	11129680	and add multiples of pi. Although the examples that we saw were more simple than some, because
11129680	11135920	for the examples we saw, the inverse trig function always landed us in the first quadrant. These
11136880	11142720	methods will work more generally. That's all for this video on solving trig equations that
11142720	11150160	require a calculator. This video is about identities involving trig functions, like sine and cosine.
11151200	11155040	But I want to start with some examples that just involve quadratic functions.
11156880	11164800	If I want to find the solutions to this equation, I can rewrite it x squared minus six x minus seven
11164800	11174480	equals zero, factor it x minus seven times x plus one equals zero, set the factors equal to zero,
11175120	11182640	x minus seven equals zero, or x plus one equals zero. And that gives me the solutions x equals seven
11183280	11190000	or x equals negative one. Next, let's look at this more complicated equation.
11190000	11196720	I'm going to try to solve that for x by multiplying out the right hand side.
11198560	11205760	Next, I'll combine terms on the right hand side. So that gives me x squared minus six x
11206880	11214320	on both sides. Well, x squared minus six x is equal to x squared minus six x. That's true no
11214320	11221200	matter what I plug in for x. And therefore, all values of x satisfy this equation.
11222240	11225280	We can say that the solution set is all real numbers.
11227920	11232320	The second equation is called an identity because it holds
11234240	11241600	for all values of the variable. The first equation on the other hand is not an identity
11241600	11245200	because it only holds for some values of x and not all values.
11246800	11252400	Please pause the video for a moment and try to decide which of the following three equations
11252400	11258160	are identities, that is, which of these equations hold for all values of the variable.
11259840	11264720	To start out, you might want to test them by plugging in a few values of the variable and
11264800	11272160	see if the equation holds. The first equation is not an identity.
11273840	11280800	It does hold for some values of x. For example, if x equals zero, then sine of two times zero
11281440	11288400	is zero, and two times sine of zero is also zero. So it does hold when x is zero.
11289120	11296720	However, when x is say pi over two, then sine of two times pi over two, that's the same thing as
11296720	11305840	sine of pi, which is zero, but two times sine of pi over two, that's two times one or two.
11306560	11312640	And zero is not equal to two. So the equation does not hold for x equals pi over two.
11312640	11317760	Since it doesn't hold for all values of the variable, it's not an identity.
11319440	11327280	The second equation is an identity. You can build some evidence for this by plugging in numbers,
11327280	11334160	for example, cosine of zero plus pi, which is negative one is the same thing as negative of
11334160	11341280	cosine of zero. You can also check, for example, that cosine of pi over six plus pi is the same
11341280	11347280	thing as negative cosine of pi over six. But even if we check a zillion examples, that's just
11347280	11351360	evidence, it's not a proof that the identity holds, we could have just gotten lucky with the
11351360	11357840	values we picked. We can build a little bit stronger evidence by looking at graphs.
11359280	11368240	I'm going to put theta on the x axis. And if I graph y equals cosine of theta plus pi,
11368240	11375040	that's just like the graph of cosine shifted over to the left by pi. On the other hand,
11375040	11380960	if I graph y equals negative cosine theta, that's the graph of cosine theta,
11382240	11387360	reflected across the x axis, which gives us the exact same graph.
11388960	11394160	So graphing both sides gives us strong evidence that this equation is an identity,
11394160	11399840	it holds for all values of theta. Now the strongest evidence of all would be an algebraic
11399840	11405760	proof, which we'll do later in the course, once we have a formula for the cosine of a sum of two
11405760	11415120	angles. In the meantime, let's look at equation C. It turns out equation C is an identity.
11416400	11420640	And we could build evidence for it again by plugging in values for x or by graphing the
11420640	11426160	left side and the right side separately and checking to see that the graphs coincided.
11426880	11431120	But for this example, I'm going to go ahead and do an algebraic verification.
11432400	11435440	In particular, I'm going to start with the left side of the equation,
11436560	11440800	and rewrite things and rewrite things until I get to the right side of the equation.
11441920	11447760	The first thing I'll rewrite is secant and tangent in terms of their constituent functions,
11447760	11456000	sine and cosine. Since secant of x is one over cosine x and tangent of x is sine x over cosine x,
11456000	11466640	I can rewrite this expression as one over cosine x minus sine x times sine x over cosine x.
11468800	11476880	I can clean up those fractions and write this as one over cosine x minus sine squared x
11476880	11482880	over cosine x. Now I notice that I have two fractions with the same denominator.
11483600	11490240	So I can pull them together as one minus sine squared x over cosine x.
11492320	11499360	Next, I'm going to rewrite the numerator one minus sine squared x using the Pythagorean identity
11499360	11507120	that says that cosine squared x plus sine squared x equals one. And therefore,
11508000	11516800	one minus sine squared x is equal to cosine squared x, just by subtracting sine squared x from both
11516800	11526320	sides. So I can replace my numerator one minus sine squared x with cosine squared x
11529600	11536160	and canceling one cosine from the top and from the bottom. That's the same thing as cosine of x,
11536160	11541920	which is the right hand side that I was trying to get to. So a combination of a bunch of algebra
11542560	11549600	and the Pythagorean identity allows me to prove that this equation is true for all values of x,
11549600	11554800	it's an identity. The best way to prove that an equation is an identity
11556080	11563520	is to use algebra and to use other identities like the Pythagorean identity
11564640	11569200	to rewrite one side of the equation till it looks like the other side.
11569520	11574720	The best way to prove that an equation is not an identity is to plug in numbers
11575600	11582320	that break the identity that is make the equation not true. Now, if you're just trying to decide if
11582320	11588320	an equation is an identity or not, and not worried about proving it, then I recommend plugging in
11588320	11593440	numbers or graphing the left and right sides to see if those graphs are the same.
11593440	11601760	Recall that an identity is an equation that holds for all values of the variable.
11602880	11607520	This video states and proves three identities called the Pythagorean identities.
11608400	11615760	The first one is the familiar cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one.
11615760	11623680	The second one says tan squared theta plus one equals secant squared theta.
11624480	11631280	And the third one goes cotangent squared theta plus one equals cosecant squared theta.
11632720	11637520	Let's start by proving that cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one.
11638960	11643520	I'll do this by drawing the unit circle with the right triangle inside it.
11644480	11649600	By the definition of sine and cosine, the x and y coordinates of this top point
11650320	11658160	are cosine theta and sine theta. The hypotenuse of my triangle is one, since that's the radius
11658160	11666880	of my unit circle. Now, the length of the base of my triangle is the same thing as the x coordinate
11667680	11677120	of this point. So that's equal to cosine theta. The height of this triangle is the same thing as
11677120	11685680	the y coordinate of this point. So that's sine theta. Now, the Pythagorean theorem for right
11685680	11691920	triangles says this side length squared plus that side length squared is equal to the hypotenuse squared.
11692880	11702640	So by the Pythagorean theorem, we have that cosine theta squared plus sine theta squared
11702640	11711200	equals one squared. I can rewrite that as cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one,
11711760	11718320	since one squared is one and cosine squared theta is just a shorthand notation for cosine theta squared.
11718320	11724720	That completes the proof of the first Pythagorean identity, at least in the case when the angle
11724720	11730400	theta is in the first quadrant. In the case when the angle lies in a different quadrant,
11730960	11736800	you can use symmetry to argue the same identity holds. But I won't give the details here.
11737920	11743760	To prove the next Pythagorean identity tan squared theta plus one equals secant squared theta,
11743760	11750160	let's use the first Pythagorean identity, which said that cosine squared theta plus sine squared
11750160	11758320	theta equals one. I'm going to divide both sides of this equation by cosine squared theta.
11760000	11763440	Now I'm going to rewrite the left side by breaking apart the fraction
11764240	11772080	into cosine squared theta over cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta over cosine squared theta.
11772320	11779040	Now cosine squared theta over cosine squared theta is just one. And I can rewrite the next
11779040	11788480	fraction as sine of theta over cosine of theta squared. That's because when I square a fraction,
11788480	11794080	I can just square the numerator and square the denominator. And sine squared theta is
11794080	11798000	shorthand for sine of theta squared, similarly for cosine squared theta.
11798160	11807120	Now on the other side of the equal sign, I can rewrite this fraction as one over cosine theta
11807120	11814000	squared. Again, that's because when I square the fraction, I just get the one squared, which is one
11814000	11820080	divided by the cosine theta squared, which is this. I'm almost done.
11820880	11824480	Sine theta over cosine theta is the same thing as tangent theta.
11824800	11833920	And one over cosine theta is the same thing as secant theta. Using the shorthand notation,
11834480	11842560	this says one plus tan squared theta equals secant squared theta, which after rearranging
11844160	11849760	is exactly the identity that we were looking for. The proof of the third
11849760	11855920	for that green identity is very similar. Once again, I'll start with the identity cosine
11855920	11862560	squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one. And this time I'll divide both sides by sine
11862560	11870880	squared theta. I'll break up the fraction on the left. And now I'll rewrite my fractions as cosine
11870880	11881840	theta over sine theta squared plus one equals one over sine theta squared. Cosine over sine can be
11881840	11894640	written as cotangent. And one over sine can be written as cosecant. That gives me the identity
11894640	11902640	that I'm looking for. We've now proved three trig identities. The first one, we proved using the
11902640	11913440	unit circle and the Pythagorean theorem. The second and third identities, we proved by using the first
11913440	11920960	identity and a bit of algebra. The sum and difference formulas are formulas for computing
11920960	11929200	the sine of a sum of two angles, the cosine of a sum of two angles, the sine of a difference of
11929200	11936560	two angles, and the cosine of a difference of two angles. Please pause the video for a moment to
11936560	11944000	think about this question. Is it true that the sine of a plus b is equal to the sine of a plus the
11944000	11956000	sine of b? No, it's not true. And we can see by an example, if we plug in say a equals pi over two
11956000	11964240	and b equals pi, then the sine of pi over two plus pi is the same thing as a sine of three pi over
11964320	11974240	two, which is negative one, whereas the sine of pi over two plus the sine of pi is equal to one plus
11974240	11982240	zero, which is one negative one is not equal to one. So this equation does not hold for all values
11982240	11989280	of a and b. There are a few values of a and b for which it does hold. For example, if a is zero and
11989280	11997440	b is zero, but it's not true in general. Instead, we need more complicated formulas. It turns out
11997440	12008560	that the sine of the sum of two angles a plus b is given by sine of a cosine of b plus cosine of a
12009280	12020560	sine of b. The cosine of a plus b is given by cosine a cosine b minus sine a sine b.
12021760	12029680	I like to remember these with a song, sine cosine cosine sine cosine cosine minus sine sine.
12031040	12033520	Please feel free to back up the video and sing along with me.
12033760	12039760	I encourage you to memorize the two formulas for the sine of a sum of angles and the cosine of a
12039760	12046000	sum of angles. Once you do, it's easy to figure out the sine and cosine of a difference of two
12046000	12054560	angles. One way to do this is to think of sine of a minus b as sine of a plus negative b,
12054560	12066800	and then use the angle sum formula. So this works out to sine cosine plus cosine
12068560	12077440	sine. And now, if I use the fact that cosine is even, I know that cosine of negative b is cosine of
12077440	12088800	b. And since sine is odd, sine of negative b is negative sine of b. So I can rewrite this as
12088800	12098160	sine of a cosine of b minus cosine of a sine of b. Notice that this new formula for the difference
12098160	12103360	is the same as the formula for the sum is just that plus sign turned into a minus sign.
12103920	12110640	We can do the same trick for cosine of a minus b, that's cosine of a plus minus b,
12112000	12123040	which is cosine a cosine minus b minus sine of a sine of negative b. Again, using even an odd
12123120	12134000	properties, this gives us cosine a cosine b plus sine a sine b. Once again, the formula for the
12134000	12139360	difference is almost exactly like the formula for the sum, just that minus sign has switched to a
12139360	12147280	plus sign. Now let's use the angle sum formulas to find the exact value for the sine of 105 degrees.
12147760	12154480	Now 105 degrees is not a special angle on the unit circle. But I can write it as the sum
12154480	12164080	of two special angles, I can write it as 60 degrees plus 45 degrees. Therefore, the sine of 105 degrees
12164400	12177760	is the sine of 68 plus 45. And now by the angle sum formula, this is sine, cosine, cosine,
12179120	12187600	sine. And I for my unit circle, I can figure out that sine of 60 degrees is root three over two,
12187680	12195360	cosine of 45 degrees, root two over two, cosine of 60 degrees is one half, and sine of 45 degrees
12195360	12203120	is root two over two. So this simplifies to root six plus root two over four.
12205440	12212800	For our last example, let's find the cosine of v plus w, given the values of cosine v and cosine
12212800	12220400	w, and the fact that v and w are angles in the first quadrant. Remember, to compute the cosine
12220400	12225280	of a sum, we can't just add together the two cosines, that wouldn't even make sense in this case,
12225280	12228800	because adding point nine and point seven would give something bigger than one,
12228800	12234720	and the cosine of something's never bigger than one. Instead, we have to use the angle sum formula
12234720	12247200	for cosine. So that goes cosine of v plus w equals cosine, cosine, minus sine, sine. Now,
12247200	12252320	I'm already know the cosine of v and the cosine of w, so I could just plug those in. But I have
12252320	12258800	to figure out the sine of v and the sine of w from the given information. And one way to do that is
12258880	12264720	to draw right triangles. So here I'm going to draw a right triangle with angle v,
12266000	12269280	and another right triangle with angle w.
12271600	12279360	Since I know that the cosine of v is point nine, I can think of that as nine over 10,
12279360	12285120	and I can think of that as adjacent over hypotenuse in my right triangle. So I'll
12285120	12289680	decorate my triangles adjacent side with the number nine and the hypotenuse with 10.
12290960	12296080	Similarly, since I know that the cosine of w is point seven, which is seven tenths,
12296080	12300480	I can put a seven on this adjacent side, and a 10 on this hypotenuse.
12302560	12306640	Now the Pythagorean theorem, let's me compute the length of the unlabeled side.
12307760	12312000	So this one is going to be the square root of 10 squared minus nine squared,
12312720	12318640	that's going to be the square root of 19. And here I have the square root of 10 squared minus
12318640	12327280	seven squared. So that's the square root of 51. I can now find the sine of v as the opposite
12327280	12333120	over the hypotenuse. So that's the square root of 19 over 10. And the sine of w
12334160	12341520	will be the square root of 51 over 10. Because we're assuming v and w are in the first quadrant,
12342000	12347360	we know the values of sine need to be positive. So we don't need to jimmy around with positive
12347360	12353760	or negative signs in our answers, we can just leave them as is. Now we're ready to plug into our
12353760	12364640	formula. So we have that cosine of v plus w is equal to point nine times point seven minus the
12364640	12372960	square root of 19 over 10 times the square root of 51 over 10. Using a calculator, this works out
12372960	12382720	to a decimal approximation of 0.3187. This video gave the angle sum and difference formulas
12384000	12389920	and use them to compute some values. To see a proof for why the sum formulas hold,
12390640	12397840	please watch my other video. Remember the angle sum formulas? Those are the formulas for computing
12397840	12410000	sine of a plus b and cosine of a plus b. I like to sing them sine cosine cosine sine
12411760	12423360	cosine cosine minus sine sine. This video gives a geometric proof of those formulas.
12424320	12428320	There are many great proofs of the angle sum formulas, but I'd like to share with you one of my
12428320	12434080	favorites for those who are interested. I'll write the angle sum formulas up here. So we'll
12434080	12440480	know what we're trying to prove. To prove these formulas, let me start by drawing an angle a
12443280	12445440	and an angle b on top of that.
12446320	12453120	Next, I'm going to draw a line perpendicular to this middle line. And I'm going to extend the top
12453120	12460960	line until it meets that perpendicular, making a right triangle. Finally, I'll draw a rectangle
12460960	12468240	around that right triangle that just touches its vertices. My rectangle is now divided up into
12468240	12473360	four right triangles. And I'm going to choose units of measurement so that the hypotenuse
12473440	12480080	of my middle triangle has length one. Now let's stop for a minute to think about the angles of
12480080	12487200	these other triangles. Since the top and the bottom edge of the rectangle are parallel lines,
12488480	12497440	and this hypotenuse is a transversal, this angle up here must have the same measure as a plus b
12497840	12506160	down here. Also, this skinny angle here must have the same measure as a down here.
12508000	12517680	Because this angle is 180 degrees minus 90 degrees minus this angle here. And this angle a is also
12517680	12524640	180 degrees, the measure of the angles in the triangle minus 90 degrees minus that same angle.
12524640	12532480	So I'll label this skinny angle with a. Next, let's figure out as many side lengths as we can.
12533520	12539760	Based on the middle right triangle with hypotenuse one, we know that this side length down here
12539760	12547200	must be cosine of b. Since adjacent over hypotenuse is cosine b. Similarly, this side length here
12547200	12565760	must be sine of b. Since opposite over hypotenuse is sine of b. Now we see that sine of b is the
12566320	12576800	of this right triangle, which means that this little side here has measure sine a times sine b.
12579440	12585520	That's because the opposite over the hypotenuse of this angle has to equal sine a.
12587040	12592880	A similar argument shows that this side has to have measure cosine a times sine b.
12593440	12598400	Please pause the video and take a moment to fill in the side lengths of this right triangle
12599680	12611840	and this right triangle. You should be getting sine a cosine b cosine a cosine b
12612800	12615680	sine of a plus b
12618480	12620320	and cosine of a plus b.
12625200	12630400	But remember, we have a rectangle here. So the opposite sides have equal lengths.
12631120	12640000	This tells us that sine of a plus b has to equal sine of a cosine of b plus cosine of a sine of b,
12640000	12648720	which is exactly the first angle sum formula. Also, cosine of a plus b, which is this side length,
12648720	12656720	is exactly the difference of this side length cosine a cosine b minus this side length sine of a
12656720	12664080	sine b. And that's the second angle sum formula. So I think that's a pretty great geometric proof
12664080	12673760	of the angle sum formulas. This video gives formulas for sine of two theta and cosine of two theta.
12674960	12680640	Please pause the video for a moment and see if you think this equation sine of two theta equals
12680720	12688720	sine theta is true or false. Remember that true means always true for all values of theta,
12688720	12691200	where false means sometimes are always false.
12693680	12698080	This equation is false because it's not true for all values of theta.
12698880	12704960	One way to see this is graphically. If I graph y equals sine of two theta,
12705520	12713360	that's like the graph of sine theta squished in horizontally by a factor of one half.
12714640	12721680	On the other hand, if I graph y equals to sine theta, that's like the graph of sine theta
12721680	12726960	stretched vertically by a factor of two. These two graphs are not the same.
12728240	12732560	So instead, we need a more complicated formula for sine of two theta.
12733280	12740880	And that formula is sine of two theta is two sine theta cosine theta.
12742000	12746480	It's not hard to see why that formula works based on the angle sum formula.
12747440	12757280	Recall that sine of a plus b is equal to sine a cosine b plus cosine a sine b.
12757760	12766960	Sine b. Therefore, sine of two theta, which is sine of theta plus theta is going to be sine theta
12767520	12775360	cosine theta plus cosine theta sine theta, simply plugging in theta for a and theta for b
12776160	12783600	in this angle sum formula. Well, sine theta cosine theta is the same thing as cosine theta sine theta.
12783600	12793120	So I can rewrite this as twice sine theta cosine theta. That gives me this formula.
12795200	12803040	There's also a formula for cosine of two theta. And that formula is cosine squared theta minus
12803040	12810720	sine squared theta. Again, we can use the angle sum formula to see where this comes from.
12811680	12821600	Cosine of a plus b is equal to cosine of a cosine of b minus sine a sine b. So if we want cosine
12821600	12829200	of two theta, that's just cosine of theta plus theta, which is cosine theta cosine theta minus
12829200	12834880	sine theta sine theta by plugging in theta for a and b.
12835760	12841760	This can be rewritten as cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta, which is exactly the formula
12841760	12848960	above. Now there are a couple other formulas for cosine of two theta that are also popular. One
12848960	12858080	of them is one minus two sine squared theta. And the other one is cosine of two theta is two
12858160	12868880	cosine squared theta minus one. You can get each of these two formulas from the original one
12869600	12876000	using the Pythagorean identity. We know that cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta
12876000	12884000	is one. So cosine squared theta is one minus sine squared theta. If I plug that into my original
12884000	12892640	formula, which I've copied here, so I'm plugging in instead of cosine squared, I'm going to write
12892640	12898880	one minus sine squared theta, I still have another minus sine squared theta. So that's the same thing
12898880	12906720	as one minus twice sine squared theta, which is exactly what I'm looking for. Similarly,
12907520	12914400	I can use the Pythagorean identity to write sine squared theta as one minus cosine squared theta.
12916000	12923680	Again, I'll take this equation and copy it below. But this time I'm going to plug in for sine
12923680	12931520	squared right here. So that gives me cosine of two theta is cosine squared theta minus the quantity
12932080	12940400	one minus cosine squared theta. That simplifies to two cosine squared theta minus one after
12940400	12947280	distributing the negative sign and combining like terms. So I have one double angle formula
12947280	12952000	for sine of two theta, and I have three versions of the double angle formula for cosine of two
12952000	12959360	theta. Now let's use these formulas in some examples. Let's find the cosine of two theta
12959360	12965680	if we know that cosine theta is negative one over root 10, and theta terminates in quadrant three.
12966880	12973760	We have a choice of three formulas for cosine of two theta. I'm going to choose the second one,
12973760	12979200	because it only involves cosine of theta on the right side. And I already know my value for cosine
12979200	12985120	theta. Of course, I could use one of the other ones, but then I'd have to work out the value of
12985120	12993280	sine theta. So plugging in, I get cosine of two theta is twice negative one over root 10
12993280	13002000	squared minus one, which simplifies to two tenths minus one or negative eight tenths, negative
13002000	13009600	four fifths. Finally, let's solve the equation to cosine x plus sine of two x equals zero.
13009600	13016240	What makes this equation tricky is that one of the trig functions has the argument of just x,
13016240	13021360	but the other trig function has the argument of two x. So I want to use my double angle formula
13021360	13030400	to rewrite sine of two x. I'll copy down the two cosine x, and now sine of two x is equal to two
13031120	13041040	sine x cosine x. At this point, I see a way to factor my equation, I can factor out a two cosine
13041040	13052800	x from both of these two terms. That gives me one plus sine x, and the product there is equal to
13052800	13061200	zero. That means that either two cosine x is equal to zero, or one plus sine x is equal to zero.
13062080	13069440	That simplifies to cosine x equals zero, or sine x is negative one. Using my unit circle,
13069440	13080800	I see that cosine of x is zero at pi over two, and three pi over two, while sine of x is negative
13080800	13090240	one at three pi over two. There's some redundancy here, but my solution set is going to be pi over
13090240	13099920	two plus multiples of two pi, and three pi over two plus multiples of two pi. This video proved
13099920	13106800	the double angle formulas sine of two theta is two sine theta cosine theta. And cosine of two
13106800	13114560	theta is cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta. It also proved two alternate versions
13115520	13123440	of the equation for cosine of two theta. This video is about the half angle formulas for computing
13123440	13133840	cosine of theta over two, and sine of theta over two. Cosine of theta over two is either plus or minus
13133840	13143120	the square root of one plus cosine theta all over two. To figure out whether to use plus or minus,
13143280	13149040	you need to know something about what quadrant the angle theta over two is. If you're expecting
13149040	13153920	cosine theta over two to be negative, then you're going to need the negative sign. You're expecting
13153920	13158080	this cosine to be positive. Then of course you want the positive sign since the square root of
13158080	13164240	something is always positive. Notice that this formula always makes sense, because the inside
13164240	13169680	of the square root sign is always going to be positive or zero, since cosine theta can't be
13169680	13176400	any more negative than negative one. We have a similar formula for sine of theta over two. And
13176400	13185280	that's plus or minus the square root of one minus cosine theta over two. Notice that the formulas for
13185280	13191680	both cosine of a half angle and sine of a half angle, both have cosine in them, they just differ
13191680	13199040	by the positive or negative sign in the inside of the square root. To see why these formulas hold,
13199040	13207440	let's recall the formulas for double angles. We know that cosine of two x is equal to two
13207440	13217280	cosine squared x minus one, or we can write cosine of two x as one minus two sine squared of x. Of
13217280	13225200	course, we can also write cosine of two x as cosine squared x minus sine squared x, but this one
13225200	13231840	won't be relevant to our discussion right now. So I'm going to start with this first formula.
13232560	13239520	And I'm going to make the substitution theta equals two x. That allows me to write cosine theta
13240080	13249280	is two cosine squared theta over two minus one, since if theta is two x, then x is theta over two.
13249520	13259040	So now I'm going to solve for cosine of theta over two. So I'll add one to both sides,
13262480	13264000	divide both sides by two,
13268800	13274880	and take the square root of both sides. That gives me that cosine of theta over two is going to be
13274880	13280720	plus or minus the square root of cosine theta plus one over two, which is the formula we're looking
13280720	13289280	for. I can carry a similar process out with the second formula. I'll substitute theta for two x,
13289280	13296800	which means that x is theta over two, that gives me cosine theta is one minus two sine squared theta
13296800	13307200	over two. Now I'll solve for sine of theta over two. I'll start by adding two sine squared theta
13307200	13316400	over two to both sides. Next, I'll subtract cosine theta from both sides. Next, I'll divide both sides
13316400	13325200	by two. And finally, I'll take the square root of both sides. That gives me sine of theta over two
13325200	13331680	is plus or minus the square root of one minus cosine theta over two, which is the formula I was
13331680	13338240	looking for. Now that we've got our formulas, and know where they come from, let's use them in an
13338240	13344720	example. Let's suppose that sine theta is four fifths, and theta is between pi over two and pi.
13345920	13353440	That means it's in the second quadrant. We want to find the exact values of cosine theta over two
13353440	13361120	and sine theta over two. Since theta is between pi over two and pi, theta over two will be between
13361120	13371200	pi over four and pi over two. So theta over two is somewhere in the first quadrant. That means
13371200	13378240	that cosine theta over two and sine theta over two will both be positive. Let me write down my
13378240	13384240	half angle formulas. And I know I could ignore the negative version and just use the positive
13384240	13389360	version. Now, unfortunately, I'm just given the value of sine theta, not cosine theta. So I can't
13389360	13395840	plug in directly. First, I have to use this value to figure out what cosine might be. I'll draw a
13395840	13403760	right triangle with angle theta. And since sine of theta is four fifths, I'll decorate the triangle
13403760	13410480	with a four and a five on the hypotenuse. That means that this side length is going to be five
13410480	13416160	squared, square root of five squared minus four squared, which is the square root of nine, which
13416160	13426320	is three. That means that cosine theta is going to be either plus or minus three fifths, because
13426320	13433760	it's adjacent over hypotenuse. Now, since I'm in the angle, the second quadrant for my angle theta,
13434320	13440960	cosine is actually going to be negative three fifths. Now I can plug into my formulas.
13441840	13448080	I get that cosine of theta over two is going to be the square root of one minus three fifths
13448080	13454880	over two. That simplifies to the square root of two fifths divided by two, which is the square
13454880	13463360	root of one fifth, or one over the square to five. sine of theta over two is the square root of one
13463360	13471760	minus cosine theta. So that's one minus negative three fifths over two. That's the square root of
13472960	13479440	one plus three fifths, or eight fifths over two, the square root of four fifths, or two over the
13479520	13486720	square root of five. In this video, we found formulas for the cosine of a half angle, and the
13486720	13494720	sine of a half angle, and use them in an example. Solving a right triangle means finding the lengths
13494720	13502960	of all the sides, and the measures of the angles, given partial information. In this example,
13503520	13509520	we're given the length of one side, and the measure of one angle, plus we know the measure
13509520	13516160	of this right angle is 90 degrees. We need to find the measure of the third angle, labeled
13516160	13523760	capital A, and the lengths of the two sides labeled lowercase b and lowercase c. To find the measure
13523760	13530480	of angle a, let's use the fact that the measures of the three angles of a triangle add up to 180
13530480	13542240	degrees. So that means that 49 degrees plus 90 degrees plus a is equal to 180 degrees. So a is
13542240	13550000	equal to 180 degrees minus 90 degrees minus 49 degrees, which works out to 41 degrees.
13551680	13555120	To find the length of the side B, we have a couple possible options.
13555280	13564400	We could use the fact that tan of 49 degrees, which is opposite over adjacent, is B over 23.
13564400	13577840	So B is 23 times tan 49 degrees, which works out to 26.46 units. Alternatively, we could use the fact
13577840	13586080	we could use the fact that tan of 41 degrees is 23 over B. Since now, if we're looking at the
13586080	13592400	angle here, 23 is our opposite and B is in our adjacent. That's a little bit harder to solve
13592400	13602960	algebraically. But we can write B tan 41 degrees equals 23, which means that B is 23 divided by
13602960	13611360	tan 41 degrees with a calculator that works out again to 26.46. The reason we want to use tan in
13611360	13619520	this problem and not say sine or cosine is because tan of say 49 degrees relates and the unknown side
13619520	13625760	that we're looking for B to the side that we know the measure of. If we had used sine instead, we'd
13625760	13632320	be saying that sine of 49 is B over C, and we'd have two unknowns, which would make it difficult to
13632320	13641520	solve. Next, to find the side length C, we can have a few options. We could use a trig function
13641520	13650240	again. For example, we could use the cosine of 49 degrees. That's adjacent over hypotenuse,
13650960	13667360	which is 23 over C. Solving for C, we get that C is 23 over cosine 49, which works out to 35.06 units.
13669120	13674800	Another option would be to use the Pythagorean theorem to find C. Since we know 23 squared
13675760	13683360	plus B squared equals C squared, in other words, that's 23 squared plus 26.46 squared
13683360	13692880	equals C squared, which means that C is the square root of that sum, which works out again
13692880	13700640	to 35.06. To review, the ideas we used were the sum of the angles
13700880	13710400	is equal to 180 degrees. We used facts like tangent of an angle being opposite over adjacent,
13710400	13715440	and similar facts about sine and cosine. And we use the Pythagorean theorem.
13716400	13721120	This allowed us to find all the angles and side lengths of the triangle, knowing just
13721120	13727600	the side length of one side and the angle of one of the non right angles to begin with.
13727840	13733680	In this next example, we don't know any of the angles, except for the right angle. But we know
13733680	13741360	two of the side lengths. To find the unknown angle theta, we can use the fact that cosine theta
13741360	13749520	is adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's 10 over 15. Cosine is a good trig function to use here,
13749520	13756480	because this equation relates our unknown angle to our two known sides. So we just have
13756480	13763200	one unknown in our equation to solve for. To solve for theta, we just take the cosine inverse
13763200	13778880	of 10 15ths, which is 0.8411 radians, or 48.19 degrees. To find the measure of angle fee,
13778880	13785360	we could use the fact that sine of fee is 10 over 15, and take sine inverse of 10 15ths,
13786320	13790800	but probably a little easier as just to use the fact that these three angles add to 180 degrees.
13792080	13801600	That tells us that fee plus 90 plus 48.19 is equal to 180, which means that fee
13803760	13814560	is 41.81. Finally, we can find x either using a trig function, or by using the Pythagorean theorem.
13816160	13823360	To find it using a trig function, we could write down something like tan of 48.19 degrees
13823360	13830240	is x over 10. To find it using Pythagorean theorem, we'd write down 10 squared plus x squared equals
13830240	13837360	15 squared. I'll use a Pythagorean theorem and find that x by doing the square root of 15 squared
13837360	13846640	minus 10 squared. That gives me an answer of 11.18. Notice that we use many of the same ideas as in
13846640	13854320	the previous problem. For example, the fact that the sum of the angles is 180, the Pythagorean theorem,
13855280	13862240	and the trig functions like tan, sine and cosine. We also use the inverse trig functions
13863200	13866480	to get from an equation like this one to the angle.
13868240	13872480	This video showed how it's possible to find the lengths of all the sides of a right triangle
13872480	13879280	and the measures of all the angles given partial information. For example, the measure of one angle
13879280	13882720	and one side, or from two sides.
13885440	13891920	Recall that solving a triangle means finding all the lengths of the sides and all the measures of
13891920	13899040	the angles from partial information. The law of cosines is a tool that can help us solve triangles
13899040	13905920	that are not necessarily right triangles. Recall that the Pythagorean theorem says that for our
13905920	13913760	right triangle, like this one, the length of the hypotenuse is related to the lengths of the sides
13913760	13921600	by the formula c squared equals a squared plus b squared. I like to think of the law of cosines
13921600	13927120	as a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to triangles that are not necessarily right triangles.
13928480	13935440	Loosely speaking, the law of cosines says that c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared
13935440	13943360	plus a correction factor, where the correction factor depends on the size of the angle that's
13943360	13953120	opposite to side c. For this first triangle, on the left, the angle that's opposite to side c
13953120	13960400	is exactly a right angle. So we know that c squared is exactly equal to a squared plus b squared.
13962080	13969280	But in this next triangle, the angle opposite to side c prime is a little bit less than a right
13969280	13976880	angle. So we expect the side length c prime should be a little bit shorter than the side length c
13976880	13984560	in the previous triangle that had the same side lengths a and b for its legs. Therefore, c prime
13984560	13991120	squared should be less than a squared plus b squared. Or in other words, c prime squared
13991120	13998640	should equal a squared plus b squared minus a little bit. In this third triangle, the angle
13998640	14005360	opposite c double prime is a little bigger than 90 degrees. So this side length c double prime
14005360	14011520	should be a little bit longer than the side length c in the right triangle with the same size legs.
14013200	14020400	So c double prime squared should be bigger than a squared plus b squared. We can write this as c
14020400	14027680	double prime squared is equal to a squared plus b squared plus a little bit. The law of cosines
14027680	14034240	says precisely what this little correction factor is. It says that for any triangle with sides a,
14034240	14045120	b, and c, an angle capital C opposite side c side c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared
14045120	14052400	minus two a, b cosine angle C. Let's analyze what happens in this equation
14053200	14058400	when angle C is equal to 90 degrees less than 90 degrees and greater than 90 degrees.
14060720	14070000	If angle C is equal to 90 degrees, then cosine of angle C is equal to zero. So we have that c
14070000	14075760	squared is equal to a squared plus b squared, the ordinary Pythagorean theorem. If on the other
14075760	14083280	hand, angle C is less than 90 degrees, then from the unit circle, we know that cosine of c is positive.
14084240	14093200	So to a b cosine C is a positive number, and we'll be subtracting a little bit from our a squared
14093200	14101200	plus b squared, just like we saw in the picture. Finally, if angle C is bigger than 90 degrees,
14101200	14108640	then we can see from the unit circle that cosine of c is negative. So two a, b cosine
14109360	14115280	capital C is going to be less than zero. And we're going to be subtracting a negative number,
14115280	14119520	which means we're actually adding a little bit, just like we saw in the third picture.
14119920	14126320	When labeling a triangle, the convention is to use capital letters for the angles and lowercase
14126320	14133600	letters for the side lengths, and to put side a opposite angle a and so on. When we wrote the law
14133600	14142000	of cosines on the previous page, we wrote c squared equals a squared plus b squared minus two a b
14142480	14150560	cosine angle C. But it doesn't matter which side we call a, which side we call b, and which side
14150560	14157280	we call C, all that matters is that this angle is opposite to this side, and between these two sides.
14158720	14165120	So we could have just as easily written a squared is equal to b squared plus c squared
14165200	14174400	minus two b c cosine a. All we've done is replace C with a, a with b,
14175680	14183600	and b with C in our labeling scheme. Or instead, we could put the b squared on the left side and
14183600	14192400	write b squared equals a squared plus c squared minus two ac cosine b. We can use whichever of these
14192480	14198960	three forms is most convenient for the problem at hand. Let's use the law of cosines to find all
14198960	14205840	the side lengths and angles in this triangle. By convention, I'll call the side opposite to angle
14205840	14218240	a little a and the side opposite angle b little b. Notice that we know two side lengths and the
14218240	14228560	angle between them. So that's an s a s side angle side triangle. If we write down the law of cosines
14228560	14236000	with the unknown side, c squared on the left side, then we have all the values for the variables on
14236000	14243680	the right side. So let's plug them in. I'll use a calculator in degree mode to find that c squared
14243680	14255360	is equal to 44.44. Taking the square root, I get that C is equal to 6.67. Next, I'll use the law
14255360	14262960	of cosines to find the angle b. I'll need to use a version of the law of cosines that has cosine b
14262960	14270880	right here. That's the version that has little b squared on the left side. And goes b squared
14270880	14280000	equals a squared plus c squared minus two ac cosine b. I can plug in values for all my side
14280000	14289840	lengths. And now I can solve for cosine b. To do that, I'll subtract eight squared and 6.67 squared
14289840	14298400	from both sides. And now I'll divide both sides by negative two times eight times 6.67. Using a
14298400	14307840	calculator, this gives me that cosine of b is equal to negative 0.1172. The negative value of
14307840	14317120	cosine indicates that my angle b must be greater than 90 degrees, which agrees with a figure. Next,
14317120	14326720	I can take cosine inverse of both sides to get that b is equal to cosine inverse negative 0.1172,
14326720	14335840	which works out to 96.73 degrees. The last thing I need to do is solve for angle a. I could use the
14335840	14342720	law of cosines again, and work out angle a just like I worked out angle b here. But a simpler
14342720	14349280	thing to do is to use the fact that the sum of the three angles equals 180 degrees. In other words,
14349840	14362000	a plus 37 degrees plus 96.73 degrees equals 180 degrees. So a is going to be 180 minus 37 minus
14362000	14374560	96.73, which works out to 46.27 degrees. In the previous example, we were given two sides and the
14374560	14382800	angle between them. In this example, instead, we're given three side lengths. So I'll call this an s s s
14382800	14391040	side side side triangle. We need to find all three angles. Although there are a lot of computations
14391040	14398720	involved, the ideas are the same as in the previous problem. To find angle capital C, we need the form
14398720	14405920	of the law of cosines that has cosine of c on the right side, and little c on the left side,
14406960	14414480	to find angle a, we need the form of the law of cosines that has cosine a on the right side and
14414480	14421360	little a on the left side. And to find angle d, we need the form of the law of cosines that has
14421360	14429520	cosine of b on the right side, and little b squared on the left side. For each of
14429520	14435520	these three equations, I'll plug in the side lengths, solve for the cosines, and
14435520	14442880	use inverse cosine to find my angles. Notice that my three angles, 60 degrees,
14443280	14453520	32.20 degrees, and 87.79 degrees add up to just almost 180 degrees. The difference is just due
14453520	14459600	to a round off error. In fact, I could have saved myself some work by just finding the
14459600	14465600	measure of angle C, and the measure of angle A, and then subtracting them from 180 degrees
14465600	14471200	to get the measure of angle B. In this video, we stated the law of cosines,
14472160	14477680	and used it to solve some triangles. The law of cosines can be thought of as the
14477680	14483440	Pythagorean theorem with a correction factor to account for triangles that aren't right triangles.
14485440	14490320	Recall that solving a right triangle means finding all the lengths of the sides and all
14490320	14496240	the measures of the angles from partial information. The law of cosines is a tool that can help us
14496240	14502720	solve triangles that are not necessarily right triangles. Recall that the Pythagorean theorem
14502720	14512160	says that for a right triangle, like this one, C squared is equal to A squared plus B squared.
14513920	14518560	I like to think of the law of cosines as a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem
14518560	14521440	to triangles that are not necessarily right triangles.
14522400	14529680	Loosely speaking, the law of cosines says that C squared is equal to A squared plus B squared
14529680	14536720	plus a correction factor, where the correction factor depends on the size of the angle that's
14536720	14544800	opposite size C. In this first triangle on the left, the angle opposite to side C is a right
14544800	14551760	angle. So we know that C squared is equal to exactly A squared plus B squared.
14553360	14560640	But in the next triangle, the angle opposite to side C prime is a little bit less than a
14560640	14567920	right angle. So this side C prime should be a little shorter than A squared plus B squared.
14568880	14576160	I'll write C prime squared is equal to A squared plus B squared minus a bit.
14579280	14586000	In this third triangle, since the angle opposite to side C double prime is a little bit bigger
14586000	14591440	than 90 degrees, this side length should be a little bit bigger than A squared plus B squared.
14592080	14595680	So I'll write it as A squared plus B squared plus a little bit.
14597040	14603120	The law of cosines says exactly what this little correction factor is. It says that for any triangle
14603120	14611680	with sides A, B, and C, an angle capital C opposite to side C, C squared is equal to A squared plus B
14611680	14621520	squared minus two AB cosine of angle C. Notice that if the angle C is less than 90 degrees,
14622400	14625520	cosine of C is going to be a positive number.
14628160	14634960	And so we'll be subtracting a positive quantity, just like we saw in the picture above.
14635920	14644080	If, however, angle C is bigger than 90 degrees, then cosine of C is negative. So by subtracting
14644880	14651200	to AB cosine C, we're actually adding a little bit, and we get a longer side, as in this picture.
14653120	14658560	When labeling a triangle, the convention is to use lowercase letters for the side lengths
14658560	14664080	and uppercase letters for the angles, and to put angle A opposite side A and so on.
14665440	14671680	When we wrote the law of cosines on the previous page, we wrote C squared equals A squared plus
14671680	14681040	B squared minus two AB cosine C. But it doesn't matter which side we call A, which side we call
14681040	14687680	B, and which side we call C. All that matters is that this angle is opposite to this side
14687680	14695040	and between these two sides. So we could have just as easily written A squared equals
14695040	14706400	B squared plus C squared minus two BC cosine A, or B squared equals A squared plus C squared
14706400	14715200	minus two AC cosine B. We can use whichever of these three forms is most convenient for the
14715200	14721840	problem at hand. Let's use the law of cosines to find the side lengths and angles of this triangle.
14722800	14731120	By convention, I'm going to call the side opposite angle B side little B, and the side
14731120	14739360	opposite angle A side little A. Since we know two side lengths and the angle between them,
14739920	14746320	we have all the information on the right side of the law of cosines. So I'll plug that in
14748560	14757760	and use a calculator in degree mode to find that C squared equals 44.44. Taking the square root,
14757760	14766800	I get that C equals 6.67. Next, I'll use the law of cosines to find the angle B.
14767760	14774400	I'll need to use a version of the law of cosines that mentions cosine of angle B here. So it'll need
14774400	14781520	to mention side length little B here. So that'll be the form B squared on the left.
14782320	14791840	I'll get A squared plus C squared minus two AC cosine B on the right. I'll plug in values
14791840	14800240	for all my side lengths. And now I can solve for cosine B by subtracting 8 squared and 6.67
14800240	14808480	squared from both sides, and now dividing both sides by negative 2 times 8 times 6.67. Using a
14808480	14819280	calculator, this gives me that cosine of B is equal to negative 0.1172. The negative value
14819280	14825360	of cosine indicates that my angle B must be greater than 90 degrees, which agrees with the picture.
14827040	14836480	Next, I can take cosine inverse of both sides to get that B is equal to cosine inverse of negative
14836480	14847440	0.1172, which works out to 96.73 degrees. The last thing I have to do is solve for angle A.
14848400	14853760	I could use law of cosines again and work it out just like I did here for angle B.
14854720	14860560	But a simpler method is to just use the fact that the sum of the three angles is 180 degrees.
14862000	14876080	So A must be 180 degrees minus 37 degrees minus 96.73 degrees. This works out to 46.27 degrees.
14877920	14882080	In the previous example, we were given two sides and the angle between them.
14882960	14888560	In this angle, we're given instead three side lengths, and we need to find all three angles.
14889760	14894640	Although there are a lot of computations involved, the ideas are the same as in the previous problem.
14895440	14903280	To find angle C, we need the form of the law of cosines that has cosine of C on the right side.
14903280	14909200	To find capital B, we need to use the form of the law of cosines that has cosine of B
14909200	14914800	on the right side and little b on the left side. So it'll be b squared equals a squared plus c
14914800	14923360	squared minus 2ac cosine b. And to find angle A, we need little a squared on the left side
14924880	14932560	so that we'll get cosine of angle A on the right side. For each of these three equations,
14932560	14939520	I'll plug in the side lengths, solve for the cosine of the angle, and use inverse cosine to
14939520	14949760	find my angles. Notice that my three angles, 60 degrees, 87.79 degrees, and 32.20 degrees,
14949760	14956560	add up to almost exactly 180 degrees. It's just a tiny bit off due to round off error. In fact,
14956560	14961520	I could have saved myself some work by just finding the measure of angle C and the measure of angle
14961520	14967040	B, for example, and then subtracting their sum from 180 degrees to get angle A.
14968640	14976240	In this video, we stated the law of cosines and used it to solve some triangles. The law of cosines
14976240	14981760	can be thought of as the Pythagorean theorem with an adjustment factor to account for triangles
14981760	14988000	that aren't right triangles. The law of signs is a tool that can be used to solve triangles that
14988000	14994240	are not necessarily right triangles. It's especially useful when we know two angles and one side.
14995520	15000640	And it can also be used in the situation where we know two sides and an angle that's not between
15000640	15009360	them. The law of signs says that for a triangle with angles A, B, and C opposite to sides,
15010160	15019440	locates A, B, and C respectively, the sign of angle A divided by the length of side A
15019440	15026800	is equal to the sign of B over B, which is also equal to the sign of C over C.
15028160	15034640	Notice that we're taking the sign of the three angles and dividing by the three opposite side
15034640	15045360	lengths. Suppose we know that angle A is 55 degrees, angle C is 67 degrees, and side B is 20 degrees.
15046640	15051520	We want to solve the triangle, that is, find the lengths of the other sides and the measure
15051520	15058560	of the third angle. Since we know two angles already, we can find the third angle by subtracting
15058560	15067520	from 180 degrees. So angle B is 58 degrees. Now I can use the law of signs to find my
15067520	15078160	remaining side lengths. To find side A, I'll use the fact that sign of angle A over side
15078160	15085760	length A is equal to sign of angle B over side length B. Since I already know three of these
15085760	15093360	quantities, angle A, angle B, and side length B, I can plug in and solve for the unknown
15094400	15102320	side length A. To solve, I'll multiply both sides by A and then multiply both sides by 20 over the
15102320	15114640	sign of 58 degrees. That gives me that A is equal to 20 sine 55 over sine 58, which works out to
15114640	15124400	19.32. Please pause the video and use the same method to find side length C. This time, we need to
15124400	15134720	involve sine of C and side length C in our equation. And we could use either the B's or the A's,
15134720	15143440	since they're both known for the other side. I'll plug in values as I can and solve for C. C works out
15143440	15154720	to 21.71. In the previous example, we used the law of signs to find the side lengths of a triangle,
15154720	15161040	because we already knew the angles. In this next example, we're given some side lengths,
15161840	15167760	and we're going to need to solve for some angles. This can be tricky, because when we write down the
15167760	15176560	law of signs and start solving for an angle, we first solve for sine of the angle. But there can be
15176560	15184640	two plausible angles that both have the same sign. For example, if sine of the angle happens to be
15184640	15197440	one half, then the angle could be either 30 degrees or 150 degrees. In some cases,
15197440	15204000	this can lead to two possible triangles that both have the conditions given. When this happens,
15204000	15209600	and there are two possible solutions, I call this an ambiguous case. With that warning,
15209600	15216000	let's figure out the details of this example. Plugging in my given information into the law
15216000	15222320	of signs, I'll focus on this portion of the equation where there's only one unknown to solve for.
15223360	15230080	First, I'll solve for sine of A, which is 8 times sine 40 degrees over 7,
15230960	15241920	which works out to 0.7346. From the unit circle, I can see that there'll be two possible angles
15241920	15249440	with this sine, one in the first quadrant and one in the second quadrant. If I take sine inverse
15249440	15260240	of both sides of my equation, I get the solution in the first quadrant, which is 47.27 degrees.
15261680	15269840	Since this angle right here is 47.27 degrees, so is this angle here. And so the angle
15269840	15276000	that I want in the second quadrant, I can get by going 180 minus 47.27 degrees,
15276880	15285840	which works out to 132.73. One of these possible angles, it's an acute angle,
15285840	15291120	the other one at obtuse angle, but both are possible configurations. I'll sketch the possible
15291120	15300480	triangles. In both triangles, side length A and B are the same, and angle B is the same,
15300480	15305600	but everything else is different. We can continue to solve for the other angle
15305600	15310800	and side in each case. In the left side, I'll call this case one.
15312720	15320560	We can solve for angle C by taking 180 degrees minus angle B minus angle A.
15321440	15331760	That gives us an angle just over 90 degrees, 92.73 degrees. Now we can use either the law of
15331760	15337360	sines or the law of cosines to find the final side length C. I'll use the law of sines again.
15338480	15343280	So I'll plug in the value of angle C into this part of my equation
15344240	15355200	and solve for C to get C equals sine 92.73 degrees times seven over sine 40 degrees,
15356320	15365120	which works out to 10.88. For the right-hand triangle, we can carry out the same steps
15365200	15372560	to get angle C and now plug into the law of sines to get side length C.
15374240	15380560	We finish solving for the two possible triangles with these given side lengths and angle.
15382160	15387680	In this video, we used the law of sines to solve a triangle in two different situations. In the
15387680	15398160	first situation, we had two angles and the side between them. So that's an ASA triangle for angle
15398160	15405040	side angle. In that situation, we ended up just using the law of sines to solve for side lengths
15405040	15411440	and there was no ambiguity. In the second situation, we had a triangle where we knew two
15411440	15418240	side lengths and an angle that was not between them. So I'll call that SSA and in that case,
15418240	15426800	we did find two possible triangles that would work. The SSA situation doesn't always give two
15426800	15433040	possible triangles. Sometimes when you go through the two cases and figure out all the other angles
15433040	15438240	and side lengths, you'll get an impossible situation and the angle, for example, that's
15438240	15444080	has to be negative because the other two angles add up to more than 180 degrees.
15445680	15449920	But you do have to be on the lookout for two possible triangles when you're solving
15449920	15457280	a triangle with the SSA information given. This video describes some of the features of a parabola.
15458080	15465440	It's vertex, focus and directrix. I want to start by finding the equation of all points
15465520	15474080	that are equidistant the same distance from a point zero P on the y axis and the horizontal line
15474080	15479520	y equals negative P. I'm assuming here that P is positive for starters.
15480960	15486160	Certainly the origin will be among those points as it has a distance of P from the point
15486800	15493840	and P from the line. But the other points on the x axis will be closer to the line
15493840	15498560	than they are to the point. So if I want the set of points that are the same distance from the
15498560	15505680	point in the line, that's going to be a curve that curves upwards, something like this. So for
15505680	15512000	example, a point out here will be the same distance from the point as it is from the line.
15513280	15519360	So our intuition is suggesting that this set of points should be the shape of a parabola.
15519360	15526800	Let's confirm this with some algebra. If we take an arbitrary point with coordinates x y,
15527760	15536080	its distance from the point zero P is given by the distance formula x minus zero squared plus
15536080	15545280	y minus p squared. Its distance from the line y equals negative P is just given by its difference
15545280	15555120	in y coordinates. So that's going to be y minus negative P or y plus P.
15556720	15559120	Let me set these two quantities equal to each other.
15560720	15567680	And simplify, I can square both sides. To get on the left x minus zero squared with the same
15567680	15575760	thing as x squared plus y minus p squared equals y plus p squared. Now I'll distribute out that gives
15575760	15588800	me x squared plus y squared minus 2 p y plus p squared equals y squared plus 2 p y plus p squared.
15589040	15598480	The p squareds cancel out as do the y squareds. And I'm left with x squared equals 4 p y after
15598480	15607760	moving this negative 2 p y to the other side. I could also write this as y equals one over 4 p x
15607760	15614960	squared. And you might recognize this as the standard parabola y equals x squared, transformed by
15614960	15621360	vertically stretched stretching or shrinking it by this factor of one over 4 p. You might recall that
15621360	15629680	this lowest point of the parabola is called the vertex. This point here is called its focus. And
15629680	15638800	the line here is called the directrix. Notice that the number P in this equation represents the
15638800	15645680	distance between the vertex and the focus and also represents the distance between the vertex and
15645680	15652640	the directrix line. For this reason, if you're interested in the focus and the vertex, this form
15652640	15659680	of the equation might be more useful than the equivalent form, something like y equals ax squared,
15659680	15666880	where the that distance p is more hidden. Now so far, we've just considered the case when p is greater
15667520	15673520	than zero. Let's look for a moment at what happens when p is less than zero. Then when we draw the point
15673520	15683040	zero p is going to be below the x axis. And the directrix y equals negative p is going to be above
15683040	15688000	the x axis because we're taking the negative of a negative number makes it a positive y value.
15689040	15691360	Our parabola will also be upside down.
15691360	15700560	All the algebra works out the same, it's just in our equation, this coefficient of y will now be a
15700560	15706080	negative number instead of a positive one. Or if we write it in this other form, which might be more
15706080	15711280	familiar, our coefficient of x squared will be negative instead of positive, which signifies that
15711280	15718320	the parabola is pointing down. Since p is now a negative number, if we want to talk about distances,
15718400	15726640	we should write absolute value of p instead of p. Next, let's turn things sideways by looking at the
15726640	15734320	equation for all points equidistance from point p zero, on the x axis, here we're assuming for
15734320	15740560	starters that p is bigger than zero, and a vertical line at x equals negative p.
15742320	15746080	Our intuition suggests that this should be a parabola pointing sideways.
15746320	15750880	And we can work out the same algebra steps to get an equation for it.
15752160	15757280	Starting with an arbitrary point x, y, the distance from the point
15758640	15766160	p zero is going to be given by x minus p squared plus y minus zero squared. The distance from the
15766160	15774720	line x equals negative p is going to be given by the difference in x coordinates. So that's going
15774720	15783920	to be x minus negative p, or just x plus p. I'll set these two distances equal to each other,
15784720	15792240	square both sides like before, and simplify. This gives me the equation y squared equals four px,
15793440	15801200	which I could also rewrite as x equals one over four p y squared, or x equals a y squared,
15801200	15807520	where my a corresponds to my one over four p. Once again, if p is negative,
15808720	15813280	then my parabola will be pointing the opposite direction. But my equation will still be the
15813280	15818560	same, it'll just have a negative coefficient of x instead of a positive one, the negative number
15818560	15827440	being hidden inside this variable p. As before, the absolute value of p gives me the distance
15827440	15834240	between the vertex and the focus, and also gives me the distance between the vertex and the
15834240	15841440	directrix. Now let's find the equation for parabola with a vertex at some arbitrary point hk
15841440	15850080	instead of the origin, assuming that the parabola opens up or down. If the parabola had its vertex
15850080	15856240	at the origin, we know it would be given by the equation x squared equals four p y, or I could
15856240	15864160	rewrite that as y equals one over four p x squared. So this parabola should just be shifted
15865200	15872640	to the right by h and up by k. From transformations of functions, we know we can accomplish this
15872640	15884320	by sticking a x minus h on the inside, and putting a plus k on the outside. In other words,
15884320	15894480	we have y minus k equals one over four p times x minus h squared, or we can write this as x minus
15894480	15905280	h squared equals four p times y minus k. So this is the original with the vertex at the origin. And
15905280	15916560	here is the transformed by shifting right and up to have a vertex at hk. Notice that the equations
15916560	15924560	are exactly the same. It's just you stuck in a minus h and a minus k near the x and near the y.
15926080	15932480	This transform parabola will have its focus, a distance of p up from the vertex. So that's
15932480	15941680	going to be the point h k plus p. And it's going to have its directrix at a distance p down from
15941680	15951200	the vertex. So that's going to be the line y equals k minus p. Everything's the same for this other
15951200	15957760	parabola pointing downwards, we just have p is negative in that case. The same story holds for
15957760	15965680	the parabola is pointing right and left. The original equation, y squared equals four p x
15966400	15974560	gets transformed when we ship the parabola over into y minus k squared equals four p x minus h.
15975760	15983200	This time, the vertex is a distance p to the left or right of my vertex. So here it would be
15984000	15992320	h plus p k. And the directrix would be shifted over by p also from the vertex. So this would be
15992320	16001120	the vertical line x equals h minus p. It works the same way when the parabola is opening left
16001120	16007920	instead of right. It's just in this case p is negative. Let's use this information to find the
16007920	16014880	equation of a parabola with vertex at 24 and focus at negative 14. I'll start with a quick sketch,
16015440	16021040	which will help me see how the parabola is lined up. So here's the vertex at 24.
16022800	16027280	And the focus is at negative 14. So here's the focus here.
16029840	16035520	Now, since the parabola always hugs its focus, that means that this parabola must be pointing
16035520	16042560	left and look something like this. The directrix is going to be on the other side of the parabola,
16042560	16048240	the same distance as the distance between the vertex and the focus. Since this distance is
16048880	16056320	a distance of three to minus negative one is three, the directrix must be three units
16056320	16063360	over here to the right. And so that would be the line x equals five.
16065600	16069200	Since my parabola is open to the left, I know I need to use the form of the equation
16070080	16079200	y minus k squared equals four p x minus h, where h k is the vertex. So that's 24.
16079840	16086000	I also know that p is going to be negative. And since the absolute value of p represents
16086000	16092160	the distance between the vertex and the focus, I know that p must be negative three.
16092960	16100080	So filling on all these numbers, I get y minus four squared equals four times negative three
16100080	16108320	times x minus two. I'll simplify that to y minus four squared equals negative 12 x minus two.
16110080	16114000	In this video, we looked at special forms of the equation for a parabola.
16114000	16123920	The forms y minus k squared equals four p x minus h and x minus h squared equals four p y minus k.
16124960	16132400	In these equations, h k represents the vertex. And p's absolute value gives the distance
16132400	16144640	between the vertex and the focus and between the vertex and the directrix.
16146560	16155680	Parabolas in this form are opening right if p is bigger than zero and left if p is less than zero.
16155680	16163200	And parabolas in this form are opening up if p is bigger than zero and down if p is less than zero.
16164400	16171440	This video is about ellipses. Recall that a circle can be defined as a set of points
16171440	16178800	whose distance from a fixed point is a constant. Any ellipse can be defined as a set of points
16179440	16184000	such that the sum of the distances
16187120	16188800	from two fixed points
16191120	16197760	is a constant. The two fixed points are called focuses or foci.
16200000	16205920	And the sum of the distances to the two foci is the total length of the string,
16205920	16211040	which is held constant as I draw the ellipse. Let's examine the features of an ellipse in more
16211040	16220960	detail. In these pictures, the two black dots are the focuses or foci. The red line segment
16220960	16226000	that cuts through the middle of the ellipse in the long direction and passes through the foci
16226000	16231360	is called the major axis. The line segment that cuts through the middle of the ellipse
16231360	16237920	in the shorter direction is called the minor axis. And the two points at the tips of the ellipse,
16237920	16241760	where the major axis actually touches the ellipse, are called the vertices.
16243920	16249040	An ellipse could be elongated in any direction, but we'll only consider ellipses that are elongated
16249040	16255280	either in the horizontal direction, or the vertical direction. Let's find the equation of an ellipse
16256240	16266960	whose foci are at negative C, zero, and C zero, and whose vertices are at negative a zero,
16267920	16273520	and a zero. This will be an ellipse that's elongated in the horizontal direction.
16274880	16282240	For any point x y on the ellipse, the sum of the distance from x y to the first focus,
16282880	16288880	plus its distance to the second focus has to be some constant. And in fact,
16288880	16295920	it turns out that constant has to equal to a, I'll show you why. If you look at this point
16295920	16303200	right here on the far right tip of the ellipse, its distance from the first focus is going to be
16303920	16312720	two C plus a minus C. And its distance from the second focus is just going to be a minus C.
16313440	16320960	If you add up C plus C plus a minus C plus a minus C, you get exactly two a.
16322400	16328160	So let me write out my formulas for distances. The distance from a point x y to the first focus,
16328240	16335840	the point negative C zero is going to be the square root of x minus negative C squared
16335840	16342320	plus y minus zero squared. And the distance from x y to the second focus, the point C zero,
16342960	16349360	is going to be the square root of x minus C squared plus y minus zero squared. That
16349360	16356400	sum needs to add up to two a. After a fair amount of algebra, this simplifies to the expression
16356800	16365680	a squared minus C squared, x squared plus a squared y squared equals a squared times a squared
16365680	16373760	minus C squared. If we let b squared equal a squared minus C squared, then we can rewrite this
16373760	16381520	as b squared x squared plus a squared y squared equals a squared b squared. And dividing both sides
16381520	16387760	by a squared b squared, this gives us the form of the equation for the ellipse x squared over a
16387760	16396640	squared plus y squared over b squared equals one. Since we got b squared as a squared minus C squared,
16396640	16404960	it follows that b is less than a. In fact, b is half the length of the minor axis. In other words,
16404960	16411760	this point right here is the point zero b. And this point is the point zero negative b.
16413200	16419840	To see why this is true, let's draw these two right triangles. The sum of the side lengths
16419840	16426080	that I've drawn has to be the total length of the string. So that equals two a, which means each of
16426080	16433600	these side lengths must be a. Now the base of this triangle is C. So by the Pythagorean theorem,
16434320	16440880	this height squared must be a squared minus C squared. Since b squared is defined as a squared
16440880	16448720	minus C squared, this height must be b. To summarize, for a number a bigger than b,
16448720	16455120	the equation x squared over a squared plus y squared over b squared equals one represents
16455120	16458880	an ellipse that's elongated
16461280	16470320	in the horizontal direction, whose major axis terminates in the points minus a zero and a zero,
16471040	16478000	and whose minor axis terminates in the points zero b and zero minus b.
16478160	16487120	It's foci are at the points negative C zero and C zero. And the relationship between a b and c is
16487120	16495440	that b squared is a squared minus c squared. Equivalently, if we add c squared to both sides
16495440	16501520	and subtract b squared from both sides, we can write c squared equals a squared minus b squared.
16502320	16507200	The way I remember this is that the biggest of the three numbers a b and c is definitely going to
16507840	16513600	be a, since a is half the length of the major axis, which is bigger than half the length of
16513600	16519360	the minor axis, and definitely bigger than the length between the origin and one of the focuses.
16520720	16525200	Since a is the biggest, and we have a Pythagorean theorem relationship between a b and c,
16526000	16530720	the equation must be b squared plus c squared equals a squared, which can be rearranged to
16530800	16537680	either of these two equations. Now, what happens instead, if we have a bigger than b still,
16537680	16542240	but this time we're dividing y squared by the bigger number squared, and x squared by the
16542240	16547600	smaller number squared. Well, this basically reverses the roles of x and y in my equation.
16548720	16554560	And so we end up with the major axis on the y axis stretching between the points, zero a
16555520	16561600	and zero negative a, whereas the minor axis is going to be along the x axis, going in between
16562160	16568720	negative b zero and b zero, and the foci are going to be here on the y axis again.
16569680	16574080	So in this case, my ellipse is elongated in the vertical direction.
16576480	16581040	Our previous ellipses were centered at the origin. What if the ellipse is centered instead
16581040	16587680	at an arbitrary point hk? Well, then we need to shift everything over by h in the horizontal
16587680	16593520	direction and k in the vertical direction. So instead of the equation x squared over a squared
16593520	16600960	plus y squared over b squared equals one, we're going to have to have x minus h squared over a
16600960	16609120	squared plus y minus k squared over b squared equals one, where a is bigger than b. That's
16609120	16614800	for an ellipse elongated in the horizontal direction. If we want an ellipse elongated in the
16614800	16621280	vertical direction, we'll still take a bigger than b, but we'll reverse the roles of x and y. So this
16621280	16627360	becomes x squared over b squared plus y squared over a squared equals one for the center at the
16627360	16635600	origin. And to shift it over, we get x minus h squared over b squared plus y minus k squared
16635600	16642960	over a squared equals one. I'll draw some pictures below. With some thought, we can label key
16642960	16649600	points. For example, this vertex must be shifted over by an amount a since a is half the length of
16649600	16658800	the major axis. So it'll have coordinates h plus a k, whereas this vertex will be h minus a k. This
16658800	16672240	point up here should be h k plus b, and this one h k minus b. The foci are at h plus c k, and h minus
16672240	16679120	c k. We can label the points on the ellipse that's elongated vertically. Similarly,
16681280	16685280	let's write the equation of the ellipse drawn below, and then we'll find its foci.
16686160	16692960	Its major axis is in the vertical direction, right here. Its top vertex is at the point
16693680	16703120	for three, as bottom vertex is at the point for negative nine. Its center is halfway between
16703120	16710800	its two vertices, which is right here at the point for negative three. Finally, I can read off the
16710800	16719520	points at the end of the minor axis. So this one is at nine negative three, and this one is at negative
16719520	16725200	one negative three. Since my ellipse is elongated vertically, I know I have an equation of the
16725200	16733520	form x minus h squared over b squared plus y minus k squared over a squared equals one with a bigger
16733520	16742640	than b. My center is my point h k, and that's equal to four, negative three. A is half the
16742640	16749040	length of the major axis. So that's the vertical distance between this point and this point,
16749040	16755200	I can just take the difference of y coordinates and see that a is equal to six. B is half the
16755200	16760640	length of the minor axis. So looking at the difference in x coordinates of these two points,
16760720	16768800	I see that B is equal to five. Throwing that all into my equation, I get that x minus four squared
16768800	16777360	over five squared plus y plus three squared over six squared equals one. The foci are going to be
16777360	16784720	somewhere along the major axis, somewhere above and below the center. To figure out how far they
16784720	16791520	are, I need to use the fact that c squared is equal to a squared minus b squared. So in this case,
16791520	16797760	c squared is six squared minus five squared, which is 11, which means that c is a square root of 11,
16797760	16805360	which is a little bit bigger than three. So the two foci are distance of square root of 11 above
16805360	16809040	and below the center. And so they'll have coordinates
16811440	16818880	of four, negative three plus the square root of 11. And four, negative three minus the square
16818880	16826960	root of 11. This video detailed the anatomy of ellipse, including its major axis, its minor axis,
16827920	16835280	its vertices, and its foci. This video is about hyperbola.
16837920	16847600	You might recall that any ellipse is the set of points x, y, such that the sum of the distances
16847600	16856800	between x, y, and two fixed points called the foci is a constant. Well, a hyperbola is a set of
16856800	16870480	points x, y, such that the difference of the distances between x, y, and each of two fixed
16870480	16881120	points, called the foci, is a constant. In this picture on the left, the two blue lines
16881840	16888400	are the two branches of the hyperbola. The two red points are the focuses or foci.
16889760	16897440	So for a point x, y on the hyperbola, if I look at the distance from x, y to one focus,
16898080	16904880	and the distance from x, y to the other focus, the difference of those two distances
16904880	16911280	will be the same, no matter which point x, y on the hyperbola that I choose.
16912720	16915600	If I draw a line between the two foci,
16917840	16924000	that line is called the transverse axis. In this left picture, we have a vertical
16924000	16930960	transverse axis. And the hyperbola itself reminds me of a person lying down horizontally.
16931840	16938240	Now in the right picture, our transverse axis between the two foci is horizontal.
16939280	16944080	And the blue hyperbola itself kind of reminds me of a person standing up vertically.
16945360	16950960	It's possible for a hyperbola to be oriented other ways, besides horizontally and vertically,
16950960	16955280	but we'll only consider horizontal and vertical orientations in this video.
16956480	16962160	If you look at where the transverse axis intersects the blue branches of the hyperbola,
16962800	16970240	you'll find these two points. Those points are called the vertices. Notice that the vertices
16970240	16976000	are the two points on the two branches that are closest to one another. The point halfway
16976000	16982160	between the two vertices, it's also halfway between the two foci, is called the center of the hyperbola.
16983920	16990000	The two black dotted lines that I've drawn that form an x are not actually part of the hyperbola.
16990720	16996160	They're called the asymptotes. And you can think of them as guidelines for drawing the hyperbola,
16996160	17000240	because the hyperbola gets closer and closer to these asymptotes, but doesn't cross them.
17000800	17002640	We'll talk more about the asymptotes later.
17003920	17009920	Let's find the equation of a hyperbola with foci at negative c zero and c zero,
17009920	17016160	and vertices at negative a zero and a zero. This hyperbola will have its center at the origin.
17017280	17023360	From the distance definition of hyperbola, we know that if we have a point x y on the hyperbola,
17024160	17027840	then if we take the distance from that point to the first focus,
17028560	17033360	and the distance to the second focus, and subtract them, we should get a constant.
17034640	17039520	We're always taking the positive difference here. So if we're on the right branch, we'll take the
17039520	17045520	distance to the left focus minus the shorter distance to the right focus. And if we happen to be
17045520	17053280	on the left branch, then we would take the longer distance to the right focus minus the
17053280	17057600	shorter distance to the left focus. When we do the differences that way, we should always get
17057600	17064560	the same number. And in fact, that difference should equal to a, I'll show you why. The reason is,
17064560	17071120	if I take my point to be this vertex here, then its distance to this focus is exactly
17071840	17080720	c minus a because c is bigger than a. And this distance to that focus is going to be, well,
17080720	17088160	let's see, this is a, this is a, and this is c minus a. So that different distance will be a plus
17088160	17096800	a plus c minus a. Now I'm going to do the difference a plus a plus c minus a minus c minus a.
17097040	17109440	That simplifies to a plus c minus c plus a, which is to a. Now I'll focus on a point on the right
17109440	17114560	branch. And I'll actually write a formula for its distance to this point. That's the distance
17114560	17123360	formula. It's going to be x minus negative c squared plus y minus zero squared. That's the
17123360	17129360	longer difference distance. Now I subtract the shorter distance, which is the distance
17129360	17135760	to this focus. And there the distance formula gives me x minus c squared plus y minus zero
17135760	17142560	squared. That should always equal to a for any point on that right branch. I'll clean up the
17142560	17148400	inside of the square roots a little bit. After that, a chunk of algebra, which I won't do here
17148400	17157520	here, allows you to simplify this equation to c squared minus a squared times x squared minus a
17157520	17164080	squared y squared equals a squared times c squared minus a squared. Since this expression, c squared
17164080	17169200	minus a squared is appearing a couple times here, I'm going to give it a new name. I'm going to let
17169200	17175440	b squared b c squared minus a squared. Now I can rewrite my equation as b squared x squared minus
17175520	17181680	a squared y squared equals a squared b squared. And dividing both sides by a squared b squared
17182800	17189440	yields the equation x squared over a squared minus y squared over b squared equals one.
17192000	17198080	In this equation, notice that a represents the distance from the center to a vertex.
17198320	17204480	The quantity c is not directly in this equation, but it's related to a and b
17205360	17211360	by this equation, which can also be rewritten as c squared equals a squared plus b squared,
17211360	17218320	or if you prefer a squared equals c squared minus b squared. I remember this one. I remember that c,
17218320	17223440	which is the distance from the center to the focus, is the largest of the three quantities a b and c.
17224400	17228960	So you might be wondering, well, what does b represent? Well, I'm going to draw a box
17229520	17236800	whose center is at the center of my hyperbola that stretches out in a from either direction left
17236800	17245280	right and stretches up by b in either direction up and down. It turns out that the corners of
17245280	17253840	such a box will be exactly on these two asymptote lines. In other words, the slope of this asymptote,
17254400	17262160	its rise over its run is b over a. And for this asymptote that's slipping downwards,
17262160	17269280	its rise over its run is negative b over a. So I can actually write the equations of the asymptotes
17270000	17282640	for this hyperbola centered at the origin as y equals b over a x and y equals negative b over a x.
17283680	17288880	We did all this work for a standing up hyperbola with its transverse axis oriented horizontally.
17290240	17294880	Let me rearrange things and we'll see what changes if the hyperbola is oriented the other way.
17295840	17299120	In this case, where we have a vertical transverse axis,
17299840	17305600	the roles of x and y are completely switched. So our equation, which we could derive the same way
17306400	17312160	becomes y squared over a squared minus x squared over b squared equals one.
17312960	17318400	We still have the same formulas c squared equals a squared plus b squared. And the two related
17318400	17323680	formulas b squared equals c squared minus a squared and a squared equals c squared minus b squared.
17323680	17330480	A is still the distance from the center to the vertex. And C still represents the distance
17330480	17338640	from the center to a focus. Now our box will extend up and down by a units and left and right by b
17338640	17347680	units. So this time, the slope of the asymptote, the rise over the run is going to be a over b
17348640	17354960	for the line that's sloped up, and negative a over b for the line that's sloped down.
17355840	17361520	This means our asymptotes, which go through the center at the origin will be given by the
17361520	17369360	equations y equals a over b x and y equals negative a over b x. I want to point out that in this
17369360	17376720	notation, a is going with x in one form of the equation and y in the other form of the equation,
17376800	17382560	but it always goes with the positive term, the term that's added instead of subtracted, whereas b
17383440	17390000	goes with the negative term, the term that's subtracted. Which term is positive, the x squared
17390000	17396000	or the y squared determines the orientation of the hyperbola this way or that way.
17397200	17401600	So far, we've been considering only hyperbola centered at the origin, and we had these two
17401600	17410640	equations for them. If we center at an arbitrary point, hk instead, we just subtract h from the x
17410640	17421600	term and subtract k from the y term. The graphs are shifted over by h and up by k. And to get to
17421600	17434480	the vertices, we just start at the center and go left and right by a or up and down by a, depending
17434480	17444880	on which way the hyperbola is oriented. So the vertices here are at h plus a k and h minus a k,
17445600	17453280	whereas over here, the vertices are at hk plus a and hk minus a.
17455120	17463760	To get to the focuses, we have to go over by C, or up and down by C,
17465120	17471200	where c squared equals a squared plus b squared. Finally, the asymptotes
17471200	17478160	still have the same slopes as before. But this time, they have to go through the center, which is at
17478160	17486320	hk instead of zero zero, their equations are going to be given by y minus k equals b over a x minus h.
17486960	17495920	And y minus k is negative b over a x minus h. Or with the other orientation, the analogous thing,
17495920	17504640	y minus k equals a over b x minus h, and y minus k equals a over b negative a over b x minus h.
17506240	17511520	We've done all the abstract theory. Let's do one example with numbers. If we're given this
17511520	17520640	hyperbola, we can read off its center as six negative three. Since the x term is positive,
17520720	17525120	I'm going to let a be the square root of four, and b will be the square root of 25.
17526800	17532160	Since the x term is positive, and the y term is negative, the hyperbola is going to be oriented
17532160	17543280	standing up like this, with a horizontal transverse axis. The distance from the center to each vertex
17543280	17551040	is given by the number a, which is two. So the left vertex will have coordinates for negative
17551040	17559200	three, and the right vertex will have coordinates, eight, negative three. To find the foci, I need
17559200	17568080	to figure out c squared, which is a squared plus b squared, or four plus 2529. So c is the square
17568080	17575840	root of 29. I'll sketch ballpark position of my foci here. And the coordinates are going to be
17576960	17584480	at, let's see, the center is six, so six minus square root of 29, same y coordinate of negative
17584480	17592960	three, and six plus square root of 29, negative three. Finally, the asymptotes will form an x
17592960	17603920	going through the center with slope given by b over a, which is five halves, and negative b over a,
17603920	17611920	negative five halves. The equations for those lines will be y plus three, coming from the center,
17611920	17619120	equals five halves, x minus six, and y plus three equals negative five halves, x minus six.
17620080	17624080	This gives a decent rough sketch of the hyperbola. If I want to be a little more accurate, I could
17624080	17631120	also plot some points by plugging in values of x and solving for y or vice versa. In this video,
17631120	17638480	we gave two equations for hyperbolas, which one you use depends on how the hyperbola is oriented.
17639600	17646320	A has to do with the distance between the center and the vertex, the number c, which can be figured
17646560	17651760	out from the equation c squared equals a squared plus b squared, is going to represent the distance
17651760	17662000	from the center to the focus. And b and a together help determine the slope of the asymptotes.
17663360	17669440	This video introduces the idea of polar coordinates. Polar coordinates give an alternative way of
17669440	17676160	describing the location of points on the plane. Instead of describing a point in terms of its x
17676160	17682720	and y coordinates, those are the Cartesian coordinates of the point. When using polar
17682720	17689040	coordinates, we instead describe the point in terms of a radius r and an angle theta.
17689920	17698160	r is the distance of the point from the origin, and theta is the angle that radius line makes
17698160	17708960	with the positive x axis. Let's plot these points given in polar coordinates. So the eight here
17708960	17715120	is the value of the radius, and the negative two thirds pi is the value of the angle theta.
17716000	17721120	The negative angle means that I need to go clockwise from the positive x axis,
17721120	17724560	instead of counterclockwise like I normally would for a positive angle.
17724560	17735120	So here, a negative two thirds pi means that I need to go to this line right here. And the eight
17735120	17740240	of for the radius means I need to go eight lines out from the origin. So my point should be around
17740240	17750160	right here. The next point has a radius of five and an angle of three pi. The angle of positive
17750160	17756960	three pi means that I go counterclockwise starting at the positive x axis. Here, I've gone around by
17756960	17764160	two pi. And here, I've got an extra pi to make three pi. Now the radius of five means I need to go
17764160	17772080	five units out from the origin. So that puts me about right here. Notice that I could have also
17772080	17778480	labeled this point with the polar coordinates of five pi. There's more than one way to assign
17778480	17787440	polar coordinates to a point. The next point has an angle of pi over four, and a radius of negative
17787440	17794000	12. The negative radius means that I need to jump to the other side of the circle before I plot the
17794000	17802240	point. In other words, instead of plotting the point at an angle of pi over four and a radius of 12,
17803200	17809360	which would be about right here, I go to the opposite side of the circle and plot it at the same
17809360	17816640	distance from the origin, but 180 degrees or pi radians around the circle over here.
17818960	17826800	Now I could have also labeled this point using a positive radius of 12, and using an angle of pi
17827040	17836320	over four plus pi, or five pi over four. And in general, a point with polar coordinates of negative
17836320	17845520	r theta means the same point as the point with polar coordinates are theta plus pi. Adding pi
17845520	17854560	just makes us jump around to the opposite side of the circle. To convert between polar and Cartesian
17854560	17863600	coordinates, it's handy to use the following equations. First, x is equal to r cosine theta,
17864400	17875760	y is equal to r sine theta, r squared is equal to x squared plus y squared, which means that r
17875760	17883520	is plus or minus the square root of x squared plus y squared. And tangent theta is equal to y
17883520	17892880	divided by x. Let's see where these equations come from. If we draw a point with coordinates x, y,
17893600	17901760	and draw lines to make a right triangle, the height of that triangle is y, the length of the base
17902320	17910080	is x, and the hypotenuse has length r theta is the measure of this interior angle.
17910080	17920960	From trig, we know that cosine theta is equal to adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's x over r,
17921520	17931200	which means that x is equal to r cosine theta. Similarly, sine theta is opposite over hypotenuse,
17931200	17939920	that's y over r, which means that y is equal to r sine theta. That gives us the first two equations.
17940080	17949040	The Pythagorean theorem tells us that x squared plus y squared is equal to r squared, and that
17949040	17960080	gives us the third equation. Finally, tangent theta is opposite over adjacent. So that's y over x,
17960080	17967920	which is the fourth equation. To convert five negative pi over six from polar to Cartesian
17967920	17976400	coordinates, we just use the fact that x equals r cosine theta, and y equals r sine theta. So in
17976400	17985600	this case, x is equal to five times cosine of negative pi over six, that's five times square root
17985600	17995120	of three over two, and y is equal to five sine negative pi over six. So that's equal to negative
17995120	18002560	five halves. To convert negative one negative one from Cartesian to polar coordinates,
18003840	18009520	we know that negative one and negative one are x and y values. So we need to use the fact that
18009520	18019280	r squared is x squared plus y squared, that is, r squared is negative one squared plus negative
18019280	18030240	one squared, or two. Also, tangent theta is y over x. So that's negative one over negative one,
18030240	18037760	or one. Now there's several values of r and theta that satisfy these equations. r could be
18037760	18046400	squared of two, or negative the square root of two, and theta could be pi over four, or five pi
18046400	18055600	over four, or we could add multiples of two pi to either of these answers. But not all combinations
18055600	18062880	of r and theta get us to the right point. The point with Cartesian coordinates, negative one,
18062880	18071040	negative one, lies in the third quadrant. But if we use a theta value of say pi over four,
18071040	18076720	and an r value of square root of two, that would get us to the first quadrant. So instead,
18077360	18086400	we need to use the polar coordinates of square root of two, and five pi over four, or if we prefer
18087120	18094000	negative square root of two, and pi over four. We could also add any multiple of two pi to either
18094000	18099360	of these values of theta, and get yet another way of representing the point in polar coordinates.
18101920	18107920	This video talked about polar coordinates, and converting in between Cartesian coordinates
18107920	18111440	and polar coordinates using some familiar equations from trig.
18115360	18122000	This video introduces the idea of parametric equations. Instead of describing a curve as y
18122000	18129200	equals f of x, we can describe the x coordinates and y coordinates separately in terms of a third
18129200	18140640	variable, t, usually thought of as time. So we can write x as a function of t, and y as a separate
18140640	18148080	function of t. This is especially useful as a way to describe curves that don't satisfy the vertical
18148080	18154240	line test, and therefore can't be described traditionally as functions of y in terms of x.
18154640	18162720	A Cartesian equation for a curve is an equation in terms of x and y only. Parametric equations
18163280	18169920	for a curve give both x and y as functions of a third variable, usually t. The third variable
18169920	18176880	is called the parameter. As our first example, let's graph the parametric equations given here
18177440	18186560	on an x y coordinate axis. We'll do this by finding x and y coordinates that correspond to the same
18186560	18195520	value of t. For example, when t is negative two, you can calculate that x by plugging in negative
18195520	18201760	two for t gives you five, and y when you plug in negative two for t gives you eight.
18201920	18207280	Please pause the video for a moment and fill in some additional values of x and y for some additional
18207280	18215200	values of t. Your chart should look like this. And when we plot the x y pairs and connect the dots,
18215200	18222720	we get something like this. Notice that this point over here corresponds to a t value of negative two,
18222720	18231120	and this point over here corresponds to the t value of two. So if we think of t as time,
18231200	18239840	we're traversing the curve in this direction. To find a Cartesian equation for this curve,
18239840	18246320	we need to eliminate the variable t from these equations. One way to do this is to solve for t
18246320	18255440	in one equation, say the first equation. So two t is equal to one minus x, which means that t
18256160	18264240	is one half minus x over two, then we can plug that expression for t into the second equation
18264240	18273760	and get y equals one half minus x over two squared plus four, which simplifies to the quadratic
18273760	18285440	equation y equals one fourth x squared minus one half x plus 17 fourths. Let's try some more
18285440	18293360	examples. A table of values for the first example helps us draw the familiar graph of a circle
18294000	18302160	of radius one. This should come as no surprise, since the equations x equals cosine t and y equals
18302160	18309360	sine t are familiar from trig as a way of describing the x and y coordinates of a point on the unit
18309360	18318720	circle. Notice that when t equals zero, our curve lies on the positive x axis. And as t increases
18318720	18324560	from zero to two pi, we traverse the curve once in the counterclockwise direction.
18324800	18332960	A Cartesian equation for this unit circle is given by the equation x squared plus y squared
18332960	18341280	equals one. This follows from the trig identity cosine squared t plus sine squared t equals one
18341280	18349680	by substituting in x for cosine t and y for sine t. Please pause the video for a moment
18349680	18354480	to graph the second curve and rewrite it as a Cartesian equation.
18356160	18362880	A table of values should help you see that the graph is again a unit circle. But this time,
18363520	18370640	as t increases from zero to two pi, we actually traverse the circle twice in the clockwise
18370640	18378160	direction. I'll draw this with a double arrow moving clockwise. The Cartesian equation for this
18378160	18386560	graph is still x squared plus y squared equals one. And so we found two different
18386560	18394160	parameterizations for the same graph on the x y axis. Let's take a look at the third equation.
18395440	18400880	There's no interval of value specified for t here. So let's just assume that t can be any real number.
18401280	18408240	Now as t ranges from negative infinity to infinity, our y values, which are given by cosine t,
18408240	18416800	oscillate between one and negative one. Our x values are always the square of our y values.
18416800	18425680	So the graph of this curve has to lie on the graph of x equals y squared, which is a sideways
18425760	18432240	parabola. But our parametrically defined curve doesn't cover this whole parabola.
18432800	18439120	Remember that y is given by cosine of t. So y can only range between negative one and one.
18439120	18443280	And so we're only getting the portion of the parabola that I shade in here.
18444960	18452080	As t varies from say zero to pi, I traverse this parabola one time. And then as t goes from pi to
18452080	18459120	two pi, I go back again in the other direction. And as t continues to increase, I traverse this
18459120	18466000	parabola infinitely many times. The Cartesian equation for this curve is the equation x equals
18466000	18471840	y squared with the restriction that y is between negative one and one.
18475280	18479760	We've seen several examples where we went from parametric equations to Cartesian equations.
18480400	18485520	Now let's start with a Cartesian equation and rewrite it as a parametric equation.
18486800	18493040	In this example, y is already given as a function of x. So an easy way to parameterize this curve
18493040	18503760	is to just let x equal t, and then y is equal to the square root of t squared minus t, substituting
18503760	18512160	in t for x. The domain restriction in terms of x just translates into a restriction in terms of t.
18514480	18519280	I call this the copycat parameterization. Since we've successfully introduced the
18519280	18527200	new variable t, but t just copies whatever x does. In the second example, we could try setting x
18527200	18537200	equal to t, then we get 25 t squared plus 36 y squared is equal to 900. And solving for y,
18537200	18544400	we'd have y squared equals 900 minus 25 t squared over 36.
18546080	18555120	So y is plus or minus the square root of this quantity. This is a very awkward looking expression.
18555120	18559120	In fact, why is not even a function of t here because of the plus and minus signs.
18560160	18562880	So let's look for a better way to parametrize this curve.
18564880	18570160	Because of the x squared and the y squared, this equation is a good candidate for parametrizing
18570160	18577520	using sine and cosine. In fact, if we divide both sides of the equation by 900, we get
18578160	18585760	25 x squared over 900 plus 36 y squared over 900 is equal to one,
18587120	18593920	which simplifies to x squared over 36 plus y squared over 25 is equal to one.
18595200	18602640	If I rewrite this as x over six squared plus y over five squared equals one,
18603600	18612160	then I can set x over six equal to cosine of t and y over five equal to sine of t.
18612160	18620320	And I can see that for any value of t, x over six and y over five will satisfy this equation
18620320	18627840	simply because cosine squared plus sine squared equals one. This gives me the parameterization
18628560	18638560	x equals six cosine of t, y equals five sine of t, which is a handy way to describe an ellipse.
18641840	18649280	As a final example, let's describe a general circle of radius r and center hk.
18650160	18659120	For any point x y on the circle, we know that the distance from that point x y to the center
18659120	18668480	of the circle is equal to r. So using the distance formula, we know that the square root of x minus
18668720	18678160	x minus h squared plus y minus k squared has to equal r. Squaring both sides,
18678160	18684560	this gives us the equation for the circle in Cartesian coordinates. So for example,
18685280	18694240	if our circle has radius five and has center at the point negative three, 17, then its equation
18694240	18703840	would be x minus negative three, that's x plus three squared plus y minus 17 squared is equal to 25.
18705520	18712400	One way to find the equation of a general circle in parametric equations is to start with the
18712400	18720560	unit circle and work our way up. We know that the unit circle with radius one centered at the origin
18720640	18726720	is given by the equation x equals cosine t and y equals sine t.
18729120	18733760	If we want a circle of radius r centered around the origin instead,
18735120	18741760	then we need to expand everything by a factor of r. So we multiply our x and y coordinates by r.
18742720	18752560	If we now want the center to be at hk instead of at the origin, then we need to add h to all our x
18752560	18760400	coordinates and add k to all our y coordinates. This gives us the general equation for a circle
18761120	18768080	in parametric equations to match the Cartesian equation above. We can write our same example
18768720	18782560	circle in parametric equations as x equals five cosine t minus three, y equals five sine t plus 17.
18785120	18790400	In this video, we translated back and forth in between Cartesian equations
18790960	18797120	and parametric equations with a special emphasis on the equations for circles.
18798240	18807360	This video is about the difference quotient and the average rate of change.
18809120	18812800	These are topics that are related to the concept of derivative in calculus.
18814160	18818720	For a function y equals f of x, like the function who's graphed right here,
18819440	18826880	a secant line is a line that stretches between two points on the graph of the function.
18829040	18836880	I'm going to label this x value as a and this x value as b. So this point here on the graph is
18836880	18846160	going to have an x value of a and a y value given by f of a. The second point will have x value b
18846160	18855040	and y value f of b. Now the average rate of change for a function on the interval from a to b
18855760	18861680	can be defined as the slope of the secant line
18865120	18866480	between the two points,
18868480	18880080	a f of a and b f of b. In symbols, that slope m is the rise over the run or the change in y
18880080	18889120	over the change in x, which is the difference in y coordinates f of b minus f of a over the
18889120	18894560	difference in x coordinates b minus a. So this is the average rate of change.
18895760	18901920	To put this in context, if for example, f of x represents the height of a tree
18902080	18912160	and x represents time in years, then f of b minus f of a represents a difference in height or the
18912160	18919840	amount the tree grows. And b minus a represents a difference in in years. So a time period. So this
18919840	18924880	average rate of change is the amount the tree grows in a certain time period. For example, if it grows
18925520	18932800	10 inches in two years, that would be 10 inches per two years or five inches per year would be its
18932800	18938560	average rate of change, its average rate of growth. Let's compute the average rate of change for the
18938560	18945680	function f of x equals square root of x on the interval for one to four. So the average rate of
18945680	18955680	change is f of four minus f of one over four minus one. Well, f of four is the square root of four
18956400	18963520	of one square root of one. So that's going to be two minus one over three or one third.
18965360	18973200	Instead of calling these two locations on the x axis, a and b, this time I'm going to call the
18973200	18983360	first location just x and the second location x plus h. The idea is that h represents the horizontal
18983360	18991840	distance between these two locations on the x axis. In this notation, if I want to label this
18991840	18999520	point on the graph of y equals f of x, it'll have an x coordinate of x and a y coordinate of f of x.
18999520	19007200	The second point will have an x coordinate of x plus h and a y coordinate of f of x plus h.
19008640	19015680	A difference quotient is simply the average rate of change using this x x plus h notation.
19016800	19020560	So a difference quotient represents the average rate of change
19020960	19034560	of a function f of x on the interval from x to x plus h. Equivalently, the difference quotient
19034560	19043200	represents the slope of the secant line for the graph of y equals f of x between the points
19043520	19054640	with coordinates x f of x and x plus h f of x plus h. Let's work out a formula for the difference
19054640	19060960	quotient. Remember that the formula for the average rate of change could be written as f of b
19061520	19068880	minus f of a over b minus a, where a and b are the two locations on the x axis.
19068880	19076800	But now I'm calling instead of a I'm using x instead of b I'm using x plus h. So I can rewrite
19076800	19085760	this average rate of change as f of x plus h minus f of x over x plus h minus x.
19087120	19094960	That simplifies a little bit on the denominator. Because x plus h minus x, I can cancel the x's
19095520	19102320	and I get the difference quotient formula f of x plus h minus f of x over h.
19104400	19109360	The quantity h on this denominator looks like a single entity, but it still represents
19109360	19116800	a difference in x values. Let's find and simplify the difference quotient for this function given.
19118000	19121120	First, I'll write down the general formula for the difference quotient.
19121360	19130480	That's f of x plus h minus f of x over h. I'm going to compute f of x plus h first,
19131040	19137200	I do this by shoving in x plus h everywhere I see an x in the formula for the function.
19138560	19147760	So that's going to give me two times x plus h squared minus x plus h plus three.
19147760	19153520	Notice how I use parentheses here. That's important because I need to make sure
19153520	19159520	I shove in the entire x plus h for x. So the entire x plus h needs to be subtracted,
19159520	19162560	not just the x part. So the parentheses are mandatory.
19163920	19170000	Similarly, the parentheses here signal that the entire x plus h is squared as it needs to be.
19170480	19178320	I'm going to go ahead and simplify a bit right now. I can multiply out the x plus h squared.
19179040	19187440	I can go ahead and distribute the negative sign. So if I multiply out, I'm going to get x squared
19187440	19197280	plus xh plus hx plus h squared. Now I can distribute the two to get two x squared plus
19197760	19206160	two xh plus two hx plus two h squared minus x minus h plus three. These two terms are actually the
19206160	19215600	same. I can add them up to get four xh. And I think that's as simple as I can get that part.
19216640	19221920	Now I'm going to write out f of x plus h minus f of x. So that's going to be
19222640	19230880	this thing right here minus f of x. Again, I need to put the f of x formula in parentheses to make
19230880	19237440	sure I subtract the whole thing. I'll distribute the negative. And now I notice that a bunch of
19237440	19243680	things cancel out. So the two x squared and the minus two x squared add to zero, the minus x and
19243680	19254800	the x add to zero, and the three and the minus three add to zero. So I'm left with four xh plus
19254800	19264240	two h squared minus h. Finally, I'll write out the whole difference quotient by dividing everything
19264240	19270640	by h. I can simplify this further because notice that there's an h in every single term of the
19270640	19278640	numerator. If I factor out this h, h times four x plus two h minus one divided by h,
19279280	19285840	these two h's cancel. And I'm left with a difference quotient of four x plus two h minus one.
19287440	19292240	This difference quotient will become important in calculus. When we calculate a difference quotient
19292240	19297120	for smaller and smaller values of h, eventually letting h go to zero and ending up with an
19297120	19303120	expression that has no h is in it and represents the derivative or slope of the function itself.
19304560	19311920	In this video, we use the formula f of b minus f of a over b minus a to calculate an average rate
19311920	19320160	of change and the related formula f of x plus h minus f of x over h to calculate and simplify a
19320160	19329200	difference quotient.
