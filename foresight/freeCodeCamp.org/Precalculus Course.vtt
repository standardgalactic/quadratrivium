00:00.000 --> 00:22.560
This video introduces functions and their domains and ranges.

00:23.200 --> 00:30.400
A function is a correspondence between input numbers, usually the x values, and output numbers,

00:30.400 --> 00:37.680
usually the y values, that sends each input number to exactly one output number. Sometimes a

00:37.680 --> 00:46.720
function is thought of as a rule or machine in which you can feed in x values as input and get

00:46.720 --> 00:53.840
out y values as output. So a non-mathematical example of a function might be the biological

00:53.840 --> 01:01.280
mother function, which takes as input any person and gives as output their biological mother.

01:02.400 --> 01:08.960
This function satisfies the condition that each input number object person in this case

01:09.760 --> 01:16.400
gets sent to exactly one output person, because if you take any person they just have

01:16.400 --> 01:22.320
one biological mother. So that rule does give you a function, but if I change things around

01:22.960 --> 01:30.640
and just use the mother function, which sends to each person their mother, that's no longer

01:30.640 --> 01:34.560
going to be a function because there are some people who have more than one mother, right? They

01:34.560 --> 01:39.360
could have a biological mother and adopted mother or a mother and a stepmother or any

01:39.360 --> 01:45.520
number of situations. So since there's at least some people who you would put it as input and then

01:45.520 --> 01:52.080
you'd get like more than one possible output, that violates this rule of functions. It would not be a

01:52.080 --> 01:57.040
function. Now most of the time we'll work with functions that are described with equations,

01:57.040 --> 02:02.480
not in terms of mothers. So for example, we could have the function y equals x squared plus one.

02:02.640 --> 02:09.200
This can also be written as f of x equals x squared plus one. Here f of x is function notation

02:09.200 --> 02:17.120
that stands for the output value of y. Notice that this notation is not representing multiplication.

02:17.120 --> 02:24.000
We're not multiplying f by x. Instead, we're going to be putting in a value for x's input

02:24.000 --> 02:31.360
and getting out a value of f of x or y. For example, if we want to evaluate f of two,

02:31.600 --> 02:38.800
we're plugging in two as input for x either in this equation or in that equation. Since

02:40.000 --> 02:49.360
f of two means two squared plus one f of two is going to equal five. Similarly, f of five means

02:49.360 --> 02:58.560
I plug in five for x. So that's going to be five squared plus one or 26. Sometimes it's useful

02:58.560 --> 03:03.680
to evaluate a function on a more complicated expression involving other variables. In this

03:03.680 --> 03:09.200
case, remember, the functions value on any expression is just when you what you get when you

03:09.200 --> 03:18.480
plug in that whole expression for x. So f of a plus three is going to be the quantity a plus

03:18.480 --> 03:28.080
three squared plus one. We could rewrite that as a squared plus six a plus nine plus one,

03:28.080 --> 03:35.600
or a squared plus six a plus 10. When evaluating a function on a complex expression, it's important

03:35.600 --> 03:42.480
to keep the parentheses when you plug in for x. That way, you evaluate the function on the whole

03:42.480 --> 03:52.960
expression. For example, it would be wrong to write f of a plus three equals a plus three

03:52.960 --> 03:56.800
squared plus one without the parentheses, because that would imply that we were just

03:56.800 --> 04:06.000
squaring the three and not the whole expression a plus three. Sometimes a function is described

04:06.000 --> 04:12.160
with a graph instead of an equation. In this example, this graph is supposed to represent

04:12.880 --> 04:19.680
the function g of x. Not all graphs actually represent functions. For example, the graph

04:19.680 --> 04:25.680
of a circle doesn't represent a function. That's because the graph of a circle violates the vertical

04:25.680 --> 04:30.720
line test, you can draw a vertical line, and I'll intersect the graph in more than one point.

04:31.440 --> 04:36.320
But our graph at left satisfies the vertical line test, any vertical line intersects the graph and

04:36.320 --> 04:42.320
at most one point. That means it's a function, because every x value will have at most one y

04:42.320 --> 04:51.280
value that corresponds to it. Let's evaluate g of two. Note that two is an x value. And we'll use

04:51.280 --> 04:58.800
the graph to find the corresponding y value. So I look for two on the x axis, and find the point

04:58.800 --> 05:06.560
on the graph that has that x value. That's right here. Now I can look at the y value of that point,

05:06.560 --> 05:13.920
looks like three, and therefore g of two is equal to three. If I try to do the same thing to evaluate

05:13.920 --> 05:21.520
g of five, I run into trouble. Five is an x value, I look for it on the x axis, but there's no point

05:22.480 --> 05:31.200
on the graph that has that x value. Therefore, g of five is undefined, or we can say it does not

05:31.200 --> 05:37.440
exist. The question of what x values and y values make sense for a function leads us to a discussion

05:37.440 --> 05:44.240
of domain and range. The domain of a function is all possible x values that make sense for that

05:44.240 --> 05:50.800
function. The range is the y values that make sense for the function. In this example, we saw

05:50.800 --> 05:57.760
that the x value of five didn't have a corresponding y value for this function. So the x value of five

05:57.760 --> 06:04.240
is not in the domain of our function g. To find the x values in the domain, we have to look at

06:04.240 --> 06:10.720
the x values that correspond to points on the graph. When we do that is to take the shadow

06:10.720 --> 06:18.560
or projection of the graph onto the x axis, and see what x values are hit. It looks like we're

06:18.560 --> 06:26.560
hitting all x values starting at negative eight and continuing up to four. So our domain

06:27.920 --> 06:33.920
is the x's between negative eight and four, including those endpoints, or we can write this

06:33.920 --> 06:40.720
in interval notation as negative eight comma four with square brackets. To find the range of the

06:40.720 --> 06:46.160
function, we look for the y values corresponding to points on this graph. We can do that

06:46.560 --> 06:52.080
by taking the shadow or projection of the graph onto the y axis.

06:55.360 --> 07:04.880
We seem to be hitting all y values from negative five up through three. So our range

07:06.240 --> 07:13.040
is wise between negative five and three, or an interval notation negative five three

07:13.040 --> 07:18.720
with square brackets. If we meet a function that's described as an equation instead of a graph,

07:19.520 --> 07:25.280
one way to find the domain and range are to graph the function. But it's often possible to find the

07:25.280 --> 07:31.280
domain at least more quickly by using algebraic considerations. We think about what x values

07:31.280 --> 07:36.480
it makes sense to plug into this expression, and what x values need to be excluded because they

07:36.480 --> 07:42.320
make the algebraic expression impossible to evaluate. Specifically, to find the domain of a function,

07:43.280 --> 07:50.960
we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero, since we can't divide by zero.

07:52.160 --> 07:59.760
We also need to exclude x values that make an expression inside a square root sign negative,

07:59.760 --> 08:04.320
since we can't take the square root of a negative number. In fact, we need to exclude

08:04.320 --> 08:10.800
values that make expression inside any even root negative, because we can't take an even root of

08:10.800 --> 08:15.120
a negative number, even though we can take an odd root like a cube root of a negative number.

08:15.840 --> 08:20.240
Later, when we look at logarithmic functions, we'll have some additional exclusions that we

08:20.240 --> 08:26.240
have to make. But for now, these two principles should handle all functions we'll see. So let's

08:26.240 --> 08:33.200
apply them to a couple examples. For the function in part a, we don't have any square root signs,

08:33.200 --> 08:39.440
but we do have a denominator. So we need to exclude x values that make the denominator zero. In other

08:39.440 --> 08:48.960
words, we need x squared minus four x plus three to not be equal to zero. If we solve x squared minus

08:48.960 --> 08:57.040
four x plus three equal to zero, we can do that by factoring. And that gives us x equals three or

08:57.040 --> 09:03.920
x equals one. So we need to exclude these values. All other x values should be fine. So if I draw

09:03.920 --> 09:11.280
the number line, I can put on one and three and just dig out a hole at both of those. And

09:11.280 --> 09:18.080
my domain includes everything else on the number line. In interval notation, this means my domain

09:18.080 --> 09:24.160
is everything from negative infinity to one together with everything from one to three together

09:24.160 --> 09:31.040
with everything from three to infinity. In this second example, we don't have any

09:31.040 --> 09:38.240
denominator to worry about, but we do have a square root sign. So we need to exclude any x values

09:38.240 --> 09:45.840
that make three minus two x less than zero. In other words, we can include all x values for

09:45.840 --> 09:52.240
which three minus two x is greater than or equal to zero. Solving that inequality gives us three is

09:52.240 --> 10:00.960
greater than or equal to two x. In other words, x is less than or equal to three halves. I can

10:00.960 --> 10:08.800
draw this on the number line, or write it in interval notation. Notice that three halves is

10:08.800 --> 10:15.120
included. And that's because three minus two x is allowed to be zero, I can take the square root of

10:15.120 --> 10:21.200
zero, it's just zero. And that's not a problem. Finally, let's look at a more complicated function

10:21.200 --> 10:26.080
that involves both a square root and a denominator. Now there are two things I need to worry about.

10:27.440 --> 10:36.240
I need the denominator to not be equal to zero. And I need the stuff inside the square root sign

10:36.240 --> 10:41.760
to be greater than or equal to zero. From our earlier work, we know that the first condition

10:41.760 --> 10:48.160
means that x is not equal to three, and x is not equal to one. And the second condition

10:48.160 --> 10:53.920
means that x is less than or equal to three halves. Let's draw both of those conditions

10:53.920 --> 11:01.600
on the number line. x is not equal to three and x is not equal to one means we've got everything

11:02.640 --> 11:08.880
except those two dug out points. And the other condition x is less than or equal to three halves

11:08.880 --> 11:15.760
means we can have three halves and everything to the left of it. Now to be in our domain and to be

11:15.760 --> 11:20.000
legit for our function, we need both of these conditions to be true. So I'm going to connect

11:20.000 --> 11:25.200
these conditions with an and. And that means we're looking for numbers on the number line that are

11:25.200 --> 11:32.160
colored both red and blue. So I'll draw that above in purple. So that's everything from three halves

11:32.160 --> 11:38.240
to one, I have to dig out one because one was a problem for the denominator. And then I can continue

11:38.240 --> 11:44.160
for all the things that are colored both, both colors red and blue. So my final domain is going

11:44.160 --> 11:52.880
to be, let's see, negative infinity up to but not including one together with one, but not including

11:52.880 --> 11:58.160
it to three halves and I include three halves since that was colored both red and blue also.

11:59.280 --> 12:04.480
In this video, we talked about functions, how to evaluate them, and how to find domains and ranges.

12:06.240 --> 12:11.040
This video is a brief introduction to increasing and decreasing functions based on their graphs.

12:11.440 --> 12:17.360
In this first example, I've graphed two lines. The first line is an increasing function.

12:18.640 --> 12:24.960
Because as the x values go from left to right, the y values are going up.

12:27.040 --> 12:33.440
This can be written more formally by saying if x two is bigger than x one, these are supposed to

12:33.440 --> 12:39.680
be x values. So that means that x two is some x value that's to the right, so that it's bigger.

12:41.040 --> 12:48.320
The next one. So whenever we have an x value x two that's bigger than x one, increasing means

12:48.320 --> 12:58.080
that f of x two has to be bigger than f of x one, so that the y values are getting bigger

12:58.080 --> 13:04.800
when the x values are bigger. The second line is an example of a decreasing function.

13:05.360 --> 13:12.960
Because here as the x values increase from left to right, the y values are going down.

13:13.920 --> 13:20.880
So again, we can write this more formally by saying that whenever we have an x value x two

13:20.880 --> 13:27.120
that's bigger than x one, for example, this might be x two and this might be x one, then

13:27.840 --> 13:36.560
the y value f of x two is less than f of x one this time, because here, when we have a bigger x

13:36.560 --> 13:44.320
value, we want to have a smaller y value to be decreasing. This second example gives the graph

13:44.320 --> 13:50.480
of a function that's increasing in some places, but decreasing in others. This part of the graph,

13:51.120 --> 13:57.360
here, the function's decreasing, because as the x values increase from left to right, the y values

13:57.360 --> 14:05.360
go down. Over here, we also have a part of the graph where the function is decreasing. Now, this

14:05.360 --> 14:10.160
part of the graph, the function's increasing, because as x goes from left to right, the y values

14:10.160 --> 14:17.200
are going up. I'll mark that one in green for increasing. And finally, on this part of the

14:17.760 --> 14:23.440
graph, the functions neither increasing nor decreasing is completely flat or constant.

14:24.640 --> 14:28.720
Now, we're asked to describe the intervals on which the graph is increasing or decreasing.

14:28.720 --> 14:35.440
So we describe those intervals in terms of the x values. It wouldn't make sense to describe them

14:35.440 --> 14:39.520
in terms of the y values, because the y values can be the same for different parts of the graph,

14:39.520 --> 14:45.680
but the x values are always unique. To describe where this function is decreasing,

14:48.080 --> 14:54.480
that's for x values between negative four and negative two, and between four and seven.

14:55.440 --> 15:01.360
I can write this using inequalities as negative four less than x less than negative two,

15:02.400 --> 15:08.400
four less than x less than seven. It's not important whether I use less than or less than

15:08.400 --> 15:15.280
or equal to signs here. I'm going to use less than or equal to signs at the end points of the

15:15.280 --> 15:20.880
function's domain, where the function stops existing altogether. And I'll use strict less

15:20.880 --> 15:26.800
than signs, just where the function starts or stops decreasing in the middle of its domain.

15:26.800 --> 15:32.560
But again, that's not important. To describe where the function is increasing,

15:35.200 --> 15:43.680
that's for x values in between negative two and one. So I can write that as an inequality as negative

15:43.680 --> 15:51.120
two less than x less than one. I can also describe these intervals in interval notation. So that would

15:51.120 --> 16:00.080
be close bracket negative four negative two open bracket, a cup sign for union, and then four comma

16:00.080 --> 16:08.000
seven for the decreasing part and the increasing part is negative two comma one. I'm going to modify

16:08.000 --> 16:13.600
my graph just a little bit now by putting arrows on the end. When I have arrows instead of

16:13.600 --> 16:20.160
dots or just hard stops, that signifies that the function continues in the same direction forever.

16:20.800 --> 16:26.800
So if I write it like that, then the place where the function is increasing is still the same,

16:26.800 --> 16:34.320
it's still going to be from x values going from negative two to one. But now the decreasing part

16:34.320 --> 16:41.600
of the function extends further. So this section, these x values extend all the way out to infinity

16:41.600 --> 16:46.320
and it we assume that it keeps going keeps decreasing here. So I would write that as

16:48.960 --> 16:56.400
for infinity. And similarly, the left part, I would write as negative infinity, negative two,

16:57.040 --> 17:02.320
because the function is going on forever in this direction to set x values go all the way to negative

17:02.320 --> 17:08.400
infinity on that chunk. So when talking about increasing and decreasing parts of functions

17:08.400 --> 17:14.080
based on graphs, the thing to remember is that x is going to be heading from

17:15.200 --> 17:23.280
left to right. As long as you do that increasing just means that y goes up. Decreasing means that

17:23.280 --> 17:32.480
y goes down. And if you're describing the intervals, you have to do that in terms of x values.

17:32.480 --> 17:41.200
This video is about identifying maximums and minimums for functions from their graphs.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.080
We'll start with some definitions.

17:46.000 --> 17:53.120
A function f of x has an absolute maximum at the x value of x equals C, if the y value

17:53.120 --> 18:01.120
at x equals C is as big as it ever gets. We can write this more precisely by saying that

18:01.840 --> 18:09.920
f of C, that's the y value at x equals C is bigger than or equal to f of x, that's the y value at

18:09.920 --> 18:24.800
some other x value. For all x values in the domain of f, that biggest y value f of C is called the

18:24.800 --> 18:33.600
absolute maximum value for f. And the point with an x value and a y value given is called an

18:33.600 --> 18:42.480
absolute maximum point. If I have a graph of a function, then the absolute maximum value

18:43.200 --> 18:49.840
f of C is the highest value that function ever achieves. And the absolute maximum point

18:50.400 --> 18:57.120
is the point where it achieves that value. Now it's possible for a function to have more than one

18:57.120 --> 19:03.040
absolute maximum point, if there happens to be a tie where that highest value is achieved.

19:03.840 --> 19:08.560
But a function can only have at most one absolute maximum value.

19:09.120 --> 19:16.960
A function f of x has an absolute minimum at x equals C, if the y value

19:18.960 --> 19:27.200
at x equals C is as small as it ever gets. We can write this more precisely by saying that

19:27.200 --> 19:36.720
f of C is less than or equal to f of x for all x values in the domain of f.

19:39.280 --> 19:50.240
The y value f of C is called the absolute minimum value of f. And the point C f of C

19:50.880 --> 19:56.320
is called an absolute minimum point. In the graph of f of x,

19:58.160 --> 20:06.720
f of C is now the lowest y value that the graph ever achieves. And the point C f of C

20:06.720 --> 20:13.040
is the point where it achieves this very low y value. For example, this function

20:13.600 --> 20:20.720
has an absolute minimum value of about negative eight. And it has an absolute minimum point

20:22.160 --> 20:30.480
with coordinates three negative eight. If this function stops here and has domain from x values

20:30.480 --> 20:38.320
just from zero to four, then the function will have an absolute maximum value of 10

20:39.200 --> 20:47.680
achieved at the point with coordinates for 10. If however, the function keeps going on forever,

20:48.400 --> 20:51.360
then it will have no absolute maximum value at all.

20:52.000 --> 21:02.080
Absolute maximum minimum values can also be called global maximum and minimum values.

21:04.480 --> 21:13.040
A function f of x has a local maximum at x equals C. If the y value at the x value of C

21:13.040 --> 21:20.000
is bigger than any y values nearby, it doesn't have to be the biggest y value anywhere in the domain.

21:20.480 --> 21:25.600
There's bigger y values up here. It just has to be the biggest y value nearby,

21:25.600 --> 21:30.320
or more precisely, in an open interval of x values around C.

21:31.760 --> 21:39.440
We can write this by saying that f of C is bigger than or equal to f of x for all x values

21:39.680 --> 21:53.040
in an open interval around C. The y value f of C is called a local maximum value for f,

21:53.840 --> 21:59.440
and the point with coordinates C f of C is called a local maximum point.

21:59.680 --> 22:10.720
A function f of x has a local minimum at x equals C, if f of C is less than or equal to f of x

22:11.360 --> 22:22.240
for all x values in an open interval around C. The y value f of C is called a local minimum value,

22:22.240 --> 22:29.600
and the point with coordinates C f of C is called a local minimum point.

22:31.360 --> 22:34.400
A function might have many local minimum values.

22:38.160 --> 22:48.800
In this example, assuming that the domain is from zero to four, we have a local minimum point

22:48.800 --> 22:57.440
at x equals three, because this point here is the lowest point anywhere nearby. It also happens

22:57.440 --> 23:04.160
to be an absolute minimum point. Turning our attention to local maximum points, this function

23:04.160 --> 23:12.080
has a local maximum point at one, two, say, because this point here is the highest point

23:12.080 --> 23:16.560
anywhere nearby, even though it's not the highest point anywhere in the domain since

23:16.560 --> 23:24.480
they're highest points, higher points over here. So we have a local max point at one,

23:24.480 --> 23:32.400
two, which is not an absolute max. Different sources use different conventions as far as

23:32.400 --> 23:38.640
whether the point four, 10 up here counts as a local maximum point or not. Some sources do

23:38.640 --> 23:43.840
consider it a local maximum, since it's the highest point anywhere nearby. But other sources

23:43.840 --> 23:49.360
say that it doesn't count as a local maximum, for the technical reason that you can't get an

23:49.360 --> 23:55.760
open interval of values around four, because the function is not defined in an open interval around

23:55.760 --> 24:02.240
four, because its domain stops at four. So I'll just write this as a caution that some sources

24:02.400 --> 24:07.040
do not consider

24:09.360 --> 24:21.280
for 10 to be a local max point, because f is not defined in an open interval

24:22.080 --> 24:34.480
around x equals four. Local maximum and minimum values can also be called relative maximum and

24:34.480 --> 24:43.760
minimum values. Please pause the video for a moment to mark all local maximum minimum points

24:43.760 --> 24:47.600
on the graph of this function, as well as all absolute maximum points.

24:47.920 --> 24:56.480
The function has a local max point here, at the point with coordinates approximately say 2.7,

24:56.480 --> 25:04.480
3.3. It's a local max point, because it's the highest point anywhere nearby. There's a local min

25:04.480 --> 25:10.880
point right here, at the point with coordinates two, two, since this is the lowest point anywhere

25:11.040 --> 25:17.200
nearby. If this point actually existed, it would also be a local min point, as well as an absolute

25:17.200 --> 25:22.560
min point. But this drilled out circle means that point is not actually part of the graph.

25:23.360 --> 25:31.120
So there's no local min point here, and no absolute min point. The point here, with coordinates 0,4,

25:31.120 --> 25:36.960
is considered by some sources to be a local max point. But by other sources, it's not considered

25:37.520 --> 25:44.560
a local max point, since the function is not defined in an open interval around zero.

25:45.520 --> 25:50.000
Turning our attention to absolute maximum min points, while there's no absolute max point,

25:50.000 --> 25:57.920
since the function keeps going up and up and up forever. There's also no absolute min point,

25:57.920 --> 26:03.760
because the function just keeps going down and down a little by a little and never actually

26:03.760 --> 26:09.840
achieves the lowest value. Now, if we're talking about local max and min values, that's just the

26:09.840 --> 26:17.120
y values of the local max and min points. So there's a local max value at this y value of 3.3.

26:17.920 --> 26:24.880
And there's a local min value of two, this points y value. There are no absolute max or

26:24.880 --> 26:34.560
min values for this function. In this video, we defined absolute and local max and min

26:36.000 --> 26:41.680
points and values. This video is about symmetry of graphs and functions.

26:43.280 --> 26:48.000
We say that a graph is symmetric with respect to the x axis, if

26:48.480 --> 26:59.760
the graph has mirror symmetry with the x axis as the mirror line. This graph here is an example.

26:59.760 --> 27:09.120
Here is the mirror line. Notice that the point five, three is on this graph. And so it's mirror image

27:09.120 --> 27:16.240
and so it's mirror image five negative three is also on the graph. Similarly, the point

27:16.960 --> 27:24.160
two two is on the graph and its mirror image two negative two is on the graph. For any point

27:24.880 --> 27:32.000
x y on a graph, its mirror image when you flip over the x axis will have coordinates,

27:32.560 --> 27:39.920
the same x coordinate, and the opposite of the y coordinate. Therefore, we can say that

27:39.920 --> 27:45.600
a graph is symmetric with respect to the x axis. If whenever a point x y is on the graph,

27:45.600 --> 27:53.120
the point x negative y is also on the graph. We say that a graph is symmetric with respect to

27:53.120 --> 28:04.480
the y axis if it has mirror symmetry with the y axis as the mirror line. This graph is symmetric

28:04.480 --> 28:12.960
with respect to the y axis. Here is the mirror line. Notice that the point with coordinates two

28:12.960 --> 28:19.360
three is on this graph. It's mirror image, which is also on the graph has coordinates

28:20.000 --> 28:27.120
negative two three. So the same y coordinate, but the opposite x coordinate. And in fact,

28:28.880 --> 28:36.000
if I take any point with coordinates x y, and I want its mirror image with the y axis as a

28:36.000 --> 28:44.560
mirror line, I'm going to get a point with the same height, the same y coordinate, but the opposite

28:44.560 --> 28:50.160
x coordinate. So I can say that a graph is symmetric with respect to the y axis. If whenever

28:50.160 --> 28:58.480
a point x y is on the graph, the point negative x y is also on the graph. Finally, a graph is

28:58.480 --> 29:10.720
symmetric with respect to the origin, if it has 180 degree rotational symmetry around the origin.

29:11.440 --> 29:21.120
This means that if I spin it by 180 degrees, the graph should line up exactly with itself.

29:22.560 --> 29:27.520
Rotating a graph by 180 degrees is the same thing as turning it upside down. So one way to see if

29:27.520 --> 29:33.280
a graph has symmetry respect to the origin is to turn it upside down and see if it looks exactly

29:33.280 --> 29:39.600
the same. This one does. Playing around with points, I noticed that the point

29:40.960 --> 29:48.320
one negative two is on this graph. If I rotate that point around the origin by 180 degrees,

29:49.760 --> 29:57.920
I get to the point with coordinates negative one two. If I start with the point on the graph

29:57.920 --> 30:04.000
with coordinates two three, and I rotate by 180 degrees, I get the point with coordinates

30:05.600 --> 30:15.040
negative two negative three. And in general, if I start with a point x y, and I rotate that 180

30:15.040 --> 30:22.960
degrees around the origin, I get the point with coordinates negative x negative y. So we can say

30:22.960 --> 30:28.480
that a graph is symmetric with respect to the origin. If whenever a point x y is on the graph,

30:28.480 --> 30:35.120
the point negative x negative y is also on the graph. Please pause the video for a moment and

30:35.120 --> 30:40.560
decide which of these graphs are symmetric with respect to the x axis, the y axis, and the origin.

30:41.120 --> 30:47.840
Some graphs may have more than one type of symmetry. Graph a is symmetric with respect to the origin.

30:48.800 --> 30:53.760
Because if you rotate it by 180 degrees, that is, you turn it upside down, it looks exactly the

30:53.760 --> 30:58.720
same. It does not have any mirror symmetry. So it's not symmetric with respect to the x axis or the

30:58.720 --> 31:07.360
y axis. Graph B does have mirror symmetry. I'll draw on the two mirror lines. So it's both symmetric

31:07.360 --> 31:14.400
with respect to the x axis, and symmetric with respect to the y axis. It also looks exactly

31:14.400 --> 31:21.520
the same upside down. So it's also symmetric with respect to the origin. Graph C is symmetric

31:21.520 --> 31:27.840
with respect to the y axis, but has no other symmetry. And graph D is symmetric with respect

31:27.840 --> 31:38.400
to the x axis with no other symmetry. We use the words even and odd to describe functions whose

31:38.400 --> 31:44.640
graphs have certain kinds of symmetry. A function is even if its graph is symmetric

31:45.920 --> 31:52.000
with respect to the y axis. Remember that being symmetric with respect to the y axis

31:52.000 --> 31:59.920
means that whenever a point x y is on the graph, its mirror image negative x y is also on the graph.

31:59.920 --> 32:12.160
That is, the y values corresponding to x and negative x are the same. Using function notation,

32:12.160 --> 32:20.560
I can write these points as the points with coordinates x, f of x, and negative x, f of

32:20.560 --> 32:28.960
negative x, since the y value of her function is given by f of its x value. So we can say that a

32:28.960 --> 32:38.080
function f of x is even if f of negative x equals f of x for all x values in its domain.

32:39.360 --> 32:46.640
The function has the same height at x and negative x. For example, we can see that function f of x

32:46.640 --> 32:51.360
equals x squared plus three is even. And one way to see this is by looking at its graph,

32:51.360 --> 32:56.640
which looks pretty much like the graph I've drawn. And noticing that its graph is symmetric

32:56.720 --> 33:02.720
across the y axis. But we can also check that this function is even algebraically

33:02.720 --> 33:09.440
without knowing anything about its graph. All we have to do is check that f of negative x is equal

33:09.440 --> 33:18.880
to f of x. So if we plug in negative x for x into this formula, that's negative x squared plus three,

33:18.880 --> 33:25.600
but negative x squared is the same thing as x squared. And so this is exactly the same thing

33:25.600 --> 33:33.040
as f of x. And the property of being even is satisfied. We say that a function f of x is odd

33:33.760 --> 33:42.000
if its graph is symmetric with respect to the origin. Recall that a graph is symmetric with

33:42.000 --> 33:50.160
respect to the origin means that whenever a point x y is on the graph, it's 180 degree

33:50.160 --> 33:56.880
80 degree rotation point, negative x, negative y is also on the graph. That is,

33:57.600 --> 34:04.080
the graphs y value at x, and the graphs y value at negative x are the opposites of each other,

34:04.880 --> 34:11.200
same magnitude, but opposite sign. If we use function notation for the coordinates of these

34:11.200 --> 34:19.440
points, this one is x, f of x. And this one is negative x, f of negative x, right, because

34:20.160 --> 34:28.080
the y value for a function at the x value of negative x is just f of negative x. So for a

34:28.080 --> 34:37.680
function to be odd, we see that f of negative x, that y value has to be the opposite of f of x,

34:37.680 --> 34:46.800
the other guy's y value. A function f of x is odd if f of negative x is the negative of f of x

34:47.440 --> 34:55.680
for all x in its domain. Let's look at this example, we could draw its graph and verify

34:55.680 --> 35:01.280
the functions odd by seeing that rotational symmetry around the origin on its graph. But we

35:01.280 --> 35:07.520
can also figure it out algebraically by checking to see that f of negative x is equal to negative

35:07.680 --> 35:14.560
of f of x. So let's plug in negative x for x in the formula for f that gives us five times negative

35:14.560 --> 35:23.360
x minus one over negative x, that simplifies to negative five x plus one over x. And we can see

35:23.360 --> 35:30.640
that that is actually the negative of five x minus one over x by factoring out a negative sign,

35:31.280 --> 35:41.520
which is negative f of x. So the property for being odd holds. In this video, we talked about

35:41.520 --> 35:49.280
symmetry with respect to the x axis, symmetry with respect to the y axis, and symmetry with

35:49.280 --> 35:55.280
respect to the origin. Functions that are symmetric with respect to the y axis are even

35:55.360 --> 36:00.080
functions, and functions that are symmetric with respect to the origin are odd functions.

36:00.960 --> 36:05.680
There's no word for functions that are symmetric with respect to the x axis. And that's because

36:05.680 --> 36:10.160
if your graph is symmetric with respect to the x axis, it's not going to be a function.

36:11.760 --> 36:16.720
This video gives the graphs of some commonly used functions that I call the toolkit functions.

36:17.600 --> 36:23.280
The first function is the function y equals x. Let's plot a few points on the graph of this

36:23.280 --> 36:33.440
function. If x is zero, y zero, if x is one, y is one, and so on, y is always equal to x,

36:34.160 --> 36:38.960
doesn't have to just be an integer, it can be any real number. And we're connecting the dots,

36:38.960 --> 36:46.480
we get a straight line through the origin. Let's look at the graph of y equals x squared. If x is

36:46.480 --> 36:56.000
zero, y is zero, so we go through the origin again, if x is one, y is one. And if x is negative one,

36:56.000 --> 37:03.760
y is also one. The x value of two gives a y value of four and the x value of negative two gives a

37:03.760 --> 37:12.480
y value of four also. Connecting the dots, we get a parabola. Notice this this function

37:12.480 --> 37:20.720
is an even function. That means it has mirror symmetry across the y axis, the left side looks

37:20.720 --> 37:26.320
like exactly like the mirror image of the right side. That happens because when you square a

37:26.320 --> 37:34.000
positive number like two, you get the exact same y value as when you square its mirror image x value

37:34.000 --> 37:42.160
of negative two. The next function y equals x cubed, I'll call that a cubic. Let's plot a few

37:42.160 --> 37:50.320
points when x is zero, y is zero, when x is one, y is one, when x is negative one, y is negative one,

37:51.040 --> 37:56.640
two goes with the point eight way up here and an x value of negative two is going to give us

37:56.640 --> 38:01.840
negative eight. If I connect the dots, I get something that looks kind of like this.

38:03.680 --> 38:12.640
This function is what's called an odd function, because it has 180 degree rotational symmetry

38:12.640 --> 38:17.840
around the origin. If I rotate this whole graph by 180 degrees, or in other words, turn the paper

38:17.840 --> 38:24.720
upside down, I'll get exactly the same shape. The reason this function has this odd symmetry

38:24.720 --> 38:32.560
is because when I cube a positive number and get its y value, I get and cube the corresponding

38:32.560 --> 38:38.800
negative number to get its y value, the negative number cubed gives us exactly the negative of

38:38.800 --> 38:45.840
the the y value we get with cubing the positive number. Let's look at the next example, y equals

38:45.840 --> 38:54.880
a square root of x. Notice that the domain of this function is just x values bigger than or

38:54.880 --> 38:59.760
equal to zero, because we can't take the square root of a negative number. Let's plug in a few

38:59.760 --> 39:07.360
x values, x is zero gives y is zero, x is one, square root of one is one, square root of four is two.

39:08.240 --> 39:11.440
And connecting the dots, I get a function that looks like this.

39:11.600 --> 39:18.400
The absolute value function is next. Again, if we plug in a few points,

39:19.600 --> 39:27.120
x is zero goes with y equals zero, x is one gives us one, the absolute value of negative one is one

39:28.800 --> 39:34.960
to two is on the graph and the absolute value of negative two is two. I'm ending up getting

39:35.680 --> 39:41.040
a v shaped graph. It also has even or mirror symmetry.

39:42.960 --> 39:49.040
y equals two to the x is what's known as an exponential function. That's because the variable

39:49.040 --> 39:52.720
x is in the exponent. If I plot a few points,

39:52.800 --> 40:06.400
two to the zero is one, two to the one is two, two squared is four, two to the minus one is one

40:06.400 --> 40:13.200
half. I'll plot these on my graph. And let me fill in a few more points. So let's see,

40:13.840 --> 40:20.320
two cubed is eight, that's way up here. And negative two gives me one fourth, one eighth.

40:20.880 --> 40:23.920
Connecting the dots, I get something that's shaped like this.

40:25.760 --> 40:30.640
You might have heard the expression exponential growth, when talking about, for example, population

40:30.640 --> 40:38.000
growth. This is function is represents exponential growth, it grows very, very steeply. Every time

40:38.000 --> 40:42.800
we increase the x coordinate by one, we double the y coordinate.

40:42.800 --> 40:51.680
We could also look at a function like y equals three to the x or sometimes y equals e to the x,

40:51.680 --> 40:59.840
where e is just a number about 2.7. These functions look very similar. It's just the bigger base

40:59.840 --> 41:06.880
makes us rise a little more steeply. Now let's look at the function y equals one over x.

41:07.840 --> 41:14.720
It's not defined when x is zero, but I can plug in x equals one half, one over one half is two,

41:16.640 --> 41:24.480
one over one is one, and one over two is one half. If I connect the dots, I get this shape

41:25.120 --> 41:29.920
in the first quadrant, but I haven't looked at negative values of x, when x is negative,

41:30.000 --> 41:34.800
one over negative one is negative one, one over negative a half is negative two.

41:35.600 --> 41:43.280
And I get a similar looking piece in the third quadrant. This is an example of a hyperbola.

41:45.840 --> 41:53.200
And it's also an odd function, because it has that 180 degree rotational symmetry.

41:53.200 --> 41:55.920
If I turn the page upside down, it'll look exactly the same.

41:56.880 --> 42:03.520
Finally, let's look at y equals one over x squared. Again, it's not defined when x is zero,

42:03.520 --> 42:11.600
but I can plug in points like one half or x, let's see one over one half squared is one over one

42:11.600 --> 42:21.600
fourth, which is four. And one over one squared, one over two squared is a fourth. It's pretty much

42:21.600 --> 42:26.560
like the previous function, it's just a little bit more extreme rises a little more steeply,

42:26.560 --> 42:31.520
falls a little more dramatically. But for negative values of x, something a little bit different

42:31.520 --> 42:37.840
goes on. For example, one over negative two squared is just one over four, which is a fourth.

42:38.400 --> 42:45.120
So I can plot that point there. And one over negative one squared, that's just one.

42:46.160 --> 42:50.480
So my curve for negative values of x is going to lie in the second quadrant,

42:50.480 --> 42:54.720
not the third quadrant. This is an example of an even function.

42:56.480 --> 43:00.640
Because it has perfect mirror symmetry across the y axis.

43:02.000 --> 43:06.880
These are the toolkit functions. And I recommend you memorize the shape of each of them.

43:08.160 --> 43:13.360
That way you can draw at least a rough sketch very quickly without having to plug in points.

43:14.480 --> 43:17.040
That's all for the graphs of the toolkit functions.

43:17.040 --> 43:25.600
If we change the equation of a function, then the graph of the function changes or transforms

43:25.600 --> 43:31.680
in predictable ways. This video gives some rules and examples for transformations of functions.

43:32.400 --> 43:37.280
To get the most out of this video, it's helpful if you're already familiar with the graph of some

43:37.280 --> 43:43.920
typical functions, I call them toolkit functions, like y equals square root of x, y equals x squared,

43:43.920 --> 43:48.480
y equals the absolute value of x and so on. If you're not familiar with those graphs,

43:49.040 --> 43:54.080
I encourage you to watch my video called toolkit functions first before watching this one.

43:55.440 --> 44:01.520
I want to start by reviewing function notation. If g of x represents the function the square root

44:01.520 --> 44:09.280
of x, then we can rewrite these expressions in terms of square roots. For example, g of x minus

44:09.280 --> 44:19.440
two is the same thing as the square root of x minus two. g of quantity x minus two means we plug

44:19.440 --> 44:27.680
in x minus two everywhere we see an x. So that would be the same thing as the square root of

44:27.680 --> 44:34.560
quantity x minus two. In the second example, I say that we're subtracting two on the inside of the

44:34.560 --> 44:40.160
function because we're subtracting two before we apply the square root function. Whereas on the

44:40.160 --> 44:45.760
first example, I say that the minus two is on the outside of the function, we're doing the square root

44:45.760 --> 44:52.240
function first and then subtracting two. In this third example, g of three x, we're multiplying by

44:52.240 --> 44:58.000
three on the inside of the function. To evaluate this in terms of square root, we plug in the entire

44:58.000 --> 45:05.840
three x for x and the square root function. That gives us the square root of three x. In the next

45:05.840 --> 45:12.000
example, we're multiplying by three on the outside of the function. This is just three times the square

45:12.000 --> 45:20.720
root of x. Finally, g of minus x means the square root of minus x. This might look a little odd

45:20.720 --> 45:25.200
because we're not used to taking the square root of a negative number. But remember that if x itself

45:25.200 --> 45:31.280
is negative, like negative two, then negative x will be negative negative two or positive two. So

45:31.280 --> 45:36.640
we'll really be taking the square root of a positive number in that case. Let me record which of these

45:36.640 --> 45:42.240
are inside and which of these are outside of my function. In this next set of examples, we're using

45:42.240 --> 45:46.720
the same function g of x a square root of x. But this time we're starting with an expression with

45:46.720 --> 45:54.800
square roots in it and trying to write it in terms of g of x. So the first example, the plus 17 is

45:54.800 --> 46:00.800
on the outside of my function, because I'm taking the square root of x first, and then adding 17. So

46:00.800 --> 46:10.960
I can write this as g of x plus 17. In the second example, I'm taking x and adding 12 first, then

46:10.960 --> 46:16.000
I take the square root of the whole thing. Since I'm adding the 12 to x first, that's on the inside

46:16.000 --> 46:24.160
of my function. So I write that as g of the quantity x plus 12. Remember that this notation means

46:24.240 --> 46:30.160
I plug in the entire x plus 12 into the square root sign, which gives me exactly square root of x

46:30.160 --> 46:37.280
plus 12. In this next example, I'm doing the square root first and then multiply by negative 36. So my

46:37.280 --> 46:44.400
minus 36 multiplication is outside my function. I can rewrite this as minus 36 times g of x.

46:45.520 --> 46:51.360
Finally, in this last example, I take x multiply by a fourth and then apply the square root of x.

46:51.360 --> 46:58.800
So that's the same thing as g of one fourth x, my one fourth x is on the inside of my function.

46:58.800 --> 47:02.560
In other words, it's inside the parentheses when I use function notation.

47:04.400 --> 47:08.160
Let's graph the square root of x and two transformations of this function.

47:09.280 --> 47:15.200
y equals the square root of x goes through the points 0011 and 42, since the square root of

47:15.200 --> 47:22.480
four is two, and looks something like this. In order to graph y equals the square root of x minus

47:22.480 --> 47:28.080
two, notice that the minus two is on the outside of the function. That means we're going to take

47:28.080 --> 47:34.960
the square root of x first and then subtract two. So for example, if we start with the x value of zero

47:34.960 --> 47:40.640
and compute the square root of zero, that's zero, then we subtract two to give us a y value of negative

47:40.640 --> 47:48.480
two. An x value of one, which under the square root function had a y value of one, now has a y

47:48.480 --> 47:56.400
value that's decreased by two, one minus two is negative one. And finally, an x value of four,

47:56.400 --> 48:02.800
which under the square root function had a y value of two, now has a y value of two minus two or zero,

48:02.800 --> 48:10.240
its y value was also decreased by two. If I plot these new points, zero goes with negative two,

48:10.640 --> 48:16.480
one goes with negative one, and four goes with zero, I have my transformed graph.

48:18.320 --> 48:24.240
Because I subtracted two on the outside of my function, my y values were decreased by two,

48:24.240 --> 48:31.440
which brought my graph down by two units. Next, let's look at y equals the square root of quantity

48:31.440 --> 48:36.480
x minus two. Now we're subtracting two on the inside of our function, which means we subtract

48:36.480 --> 48:42.160
two from x first and then take the square root. In order to get the same y value of zero as we

48:42.160 --> 48:48.640
had in our blue graph, we need our x minus two to be zero. So we need our original x to be two.

48:50.080 --> 48:53.520
In order to get the y value of one that we had in our blue graph,

48:54.400 --> 48:59.120
we need to be taking the square root of one. So we need x minus two to be one,

48:59.120 --> 49:01.840
which means that we need to start with an x value of three.

49:02.800 --> 49:09.520
And in order to reproduce our y value of two from our original graph, we need the square root

49:09.520 --> 49:15.520
of x minus two to be two, which means we need to start out by taking the square root of four,

49:15.520 --> 49:21.040
which means our x minus two is four. So our x should be up there at six.

49:22.560 --> 49:28.880
If I plot my x values with my corresponding y values of square root of x minus two,

49:28.960 --> 49:36.000
I get the following graph. Notice that the graph has moved horizontally to the right by two units.

49:37.520 --> 49:44.160
To me, moving down by two units makes sense because we're subtracting two. So we're decreasing

49:44.160 --> 49:49.520
y's by two units. But the minus two on the inside, that kind of does the opposite of what I expect.

49:49.520 --> 49:56.160
I might expect it to move the graph left. I might expect the x values to be going down by two units.

49:56.160 --> 50:02.720
But instead, it moves the graph to the right because the x units have to go up by two units

50:02.720 --> 50:07.040
in order to get the right square root when I then subtract two units again.

50:07.840 --> 50:10.800
The observations we made for these transformations of functions

50:11.520 --> 50:18.240
hold in general, according to the following rules. First of all, numbers on the outside of the function,

50:18.240 --> 50:24.800
like in our example, y equals the square root of x minus two, those numbers affect the y values

50:24.800 --> 50:30.560
and result in vertical motions, like we saw. These motions are in the direction you expect,

50:30.560 --> 50:36.960
so subtracting two moves just down by two. If we were adding two instead, that would move us up by two.

50:38.240 --> 50:42.000
Numbers on the inside of the function, that's like our example,

50:42.000 --> 50:48.160
y equals the square root of quantity x minus two, those affect the x values and result in a

50:48.160 --> 50:53.920
horizontal motion. These motions go in the opposite direction from what you expect. Remember,

50:53.920 --> 50:59.360
the minus two on the inside actually shifted our graph to the right. If it had a plus two on the

50:59.360 --> 51:06.720
inside, that would actually shift our graph to the left. Adding results in a shift, those are

51:06.720 --> 51:13.840
called translations, but multiplying like something like y equals three times the square root of x,

51:13.840 --> 51:20.720
that would result in a stretch or shrink. In other words, if I start with the square root of x,

51:21.040 --> 51:26.640
and then want to graph y equals three times the square root of x, that stretches my graph

51:26.640 --> 51:35.440
vertically by a factor of three, like this. If I want to graph y equals one third times the square

51:35.440 --> 51:43.120
root of x, that shrinks my graph vertically by a factor of one third. Finally, a negative sign

51:43.120 --> 51:48.800
results in reflection. For example, if I start with a graph of y equals the square root of x,

51:49.280 --> 51:55.360
and then want to graph y equals the square root of negative x, that's going to do a reflection in

51:55.360 --> 52:01.040
the horizontal direction because the negative is on the inside of the square root sign. A reflection

52:01.040 --> 52:08.160
in the horizontal direction means a reflection across the y axis. If instead, I want to graph

52:08.160 --> 52:13.280
y equals negative the square root of x, that negative sign on the outside means a vertical

52:14.240 --> 52:22.080
reflection, a reflection across the x axis. Pause the video for a moment and see if you

52:22.080 --> 52:27.760
could describe what happens in these four transformations. In the first example, we're

52:27.760 --> 52:33.440
subtracting four on the outside of the function. Adding and subtracting means a translation or

52:33.440 --> 52:38.720
shift. And since we're on the outside of the function that affects the y values, that's moving

52:38.720 --> 52:46.000
us vertically. So this transformation should take the square root of graph and move it down

52:46.000 --> 52:54.400
by four units. That would look something like this. In the next example, we're adding 12 on the

52:54.400 --> 53:00.960
inside. That's still a translation, but now we're moving horizontally. And so since we go the

53:00.960 --> 53:06.800
opposite direction we expect, we are going to go to the left by 12 units. That's going to look

53:06.800 --> 53:13.040
something like this. In the next example, we're multiplying by three and introducing a negative

53:13.040 --> 53:19.120
sign, both on the outside of our function. Outside our function means we're affecting the y values.

53:19.120 --> 53:26.080
So and multiplication means we're stretching by a factor of three, the negative sign means we reflect

53:26.080 --> 53:32.160
in the vertical direction. Here's stretching by a factor of three vertically, before I applied

53:32.160 --> 53:39.920
the minus sign. And now the minus sign reflects in the vertical direction. Finally, in this last

53:39.920 --> 53:45.760
example, we're multiplying by one quarter on the inside of our function. We know that multiplication

53:45.760 --> 53:52.320
means stretch or shrink. And since we're on the inside, it's a horizontal motion. And it does the

53:52.320 --> 53:57.840
opposite of what we expect. So instead of shrinking by a factor of one fourth horizontally, it's

53:57.840 --> 54:04.400
actually going to stretch by the reciprocal, a factor of four horizontally. That'll look something

54:04.400 --> 54:10.960
like this. Notice that stretching horizontally by a factor of four looks kind of like shrinking

54:10.960 --> 54:17.120
vertically by a factor of one half. And that's actually borne out by the algebra, because the

54:17.120 --> 54:22.080
square root of one fourth x is the same thing as the square root of one fourth times the square root

54:22.080 --> 54:28.080
of x, which is the same thing as one half times the square root of x. And so now we can see

54:28.080 --> 54:34.880
algebraically, that a vertical shrink by a factor of one half is the same as a horizontal

54:34.880 --> 54:39.200
stretch by a factor of four, at least for this function, the square root function.

54:40.800 --> 54:45.120
This video gave some rules for transformations of functions, which I'll repeat below.

54:46.080 --> 54:54.000
Numbers on the outside correspond to changes in the y values, or vertical motions.

54:55.280 --> 55:01.520
Numbers on the inside of the function affect the x values and result in horizontal motions.

55:02.640 --> 55:08.240
Adding and subtracting corresponds to translations or shifts.

55:08.880 --> 55:13.680
Multiplying and dividing by numbers corresponds to stretches and shrinks.

55:14.960 --> 55:22.880
And putting in a negative sign corresponds to a reflection, a horizontal reflection,

55:23.600 --> 55:28.480
if the negative sign is on the inside, and a vertical reflection, if the negative sign is on

55:28.480 --> 55:34.480
the outside. Knowing these basic rules about transformations empowers you to be able to

55:35.440 --> 55:41.520
sketch graphs of much more complicated functions, like y equals three times the square root of x

55:41.520 --> 55:49.680
plus two, by simply considering the transformations one at a time. This video introduces piecewise

55:49.680 --> 55:58.080
functions. A piecewise function is a function who's defined in pieces by two or more different rules

55:58.160 --> 56:04.480
that apply for different x values. The rule for calculating this function is you calculate

56:04.480 --> 56:10.960
negative x squared, if x is less than one, but you calculate negative two x plus three, if x is

56:10.960 --> 56:17.760
greater than or equal to one. So if we want to find f of negative two, well, negative two is less

56:17.760 --> 56:26.160
than one. So the first rule applies. And we compute f of negative two by plugging in negative two

56:26.160 --> 56:32.320
for x in the first rule. So that's negative four. Next, if we want to find f of one,

56:33.280 --> 56:39.200
well, one is right on the border in between the two rules. But because we have a greater than or

56:39.200 --> 56:46.880
equal to here, when x is equal to one, we apply this rule. And so we can plug one into the formula

56:46.880 --> 56:52.800
negative two x plus three, so that's negative two times one plus three, which gives us one as our

56:52.800 --> 56:59.280
output. Finally, if we want to compute f of three, since three is bigger than or equal to one,

56:59.280 --> 57:06.960
the second rule applies, and we plug three into that rule. That gives us an answer of negative three.

57:07.760 --> 57:13.520
To graph f, it makes sense to also draw the graph in pieces. First, I'm going to draw the graph of

57:13.520 --> 57:21.280
minus x squared. Just x squared would be a parabola opening up. So minus x squared is a parabola

57:21.280 --> 57:30.800
opening down goes through the points negative one, negative one and one negative one. So it looks

57:30.800 --> 57:38.000
something like this. Now I've drawn the whole parabola, but the rule actually only applies

57:38.000 --> 57:43.920
when x is less than one. So I'll keep the part of the parabola when x is less than one, and I'll

57:43.920 --> 57:50.400
erase the part of the parabola when x is greater than or equal to one. I'll leave an open circle

57:50.400 --> 57:57.040
here when x equals one, since that point is not included in this definition either. Next, I'm going

57:57.040 --> 58:03.680
to draw the second piece, the line y equals minus two x plus three. So that's a line with slope

58:03.680 --> 58:09.920
negative two and intercept y intercept three, so it goes through this point zero three. And then it

58:09.920 --> 58:18.800
goes over by one and down by two. So it goes through the point one one over by one down by two.

58:19.680 --> 58:22.720
And I can continue and draw this straight line.

58:26.160 --> 58:30.800
Again, we only want part of this graph, the part where x is greater than or equal to one. So I'll

58:31.440 --> 58:37.440
erase the part where x is less than one, this part here. This time, I'm going to leave a closed

58:37.440 --> 58:44.320
circle where x is equal to one, since that point is included on that graph. When drawing this graph,

58:44.320 --> 58:49.760
it's good to think about what happens when x equals one, the border point, both in the

58:50.480 --> 58:55.440
second rule, where we actually include that point, and in the first rule, where we don't

58:55.440 --> 58:59.760
actually include that point, but we kind of have to draw it in order anyway to draw the open circle

58:59.760 --> 59:06.640
here. Now the last question asks us if this function is continuous. The informal definition of

59:06.640 --> 59:10.080
continuity that I'm going to use is that a function is continuous if you can draw the whole

59:10.080 --> 59:15.360
thing without picking up your pencil. In this case, we can't, because we have to pick up our

59:15.360 --> 59:21.920
pencil to get from the jump here up to here. So this function is not continuous, it's got a

59:21.920 --> 59:28.400
discontinuity when x is one, which is exactly the border port between the two rules. Often,

59:28.400 --> 59:33.920
piecewise functions will have discontinuities, where they transition from one rule to the next.

59:34.480 --> 59:38.800
However, it's possible to have a piecewise defined function that has no discontinuity,

59:38.880 --> 59:44.880
if the two pieces happen to line up perfectly. For example, if we've changed the function's

59:44.880 --> 59:50.080
definition slightly, I'll call it g of x's time to still be the negative x squared,

59:50.080 --> 59:56.320
when x is less than one, but this time, negative two x plus one, if x is bigger than or equal to one.

59:57.120 --> 01:00:05.520
Then when we graph it, the parabola piece will look the same. But the linear piece will be two

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:12.400
units lower than before. And so it'll actually start right here at one negative one and go down,

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:18.160
and our function will be continuous. That's all for this introduction to piecewise functions.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:25.840
The inverse of a function undoes what the function does. So the inverse of tying your shoes

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:32.720
would be to untie them. And the inverse of the function that adds two to a number

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:40.480
would be the function that subtracts two from a number. This video introduces inverses and

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:47.520
their properties. Suppose f of x is the function defined by this chart. In other words, f of two

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:57.040
is three, f of three is five, f of four is six, and f of five is one. The inverse function for f,

01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:05.120
written f superscript negative one x undoes what f does. Since f takes two to three,

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:14.160
f inverse takes three back to two. So we write this f superscript negative one of three is two.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:23.280
Similarly, since f takes three to five, f inverse takes five to three.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:33.440
And since f takes four to six, f inverse of six is four. And since f takes five to one,

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:41.040
f inverse of one is five. I'll use these numbers to fill in the chart. Notice that the chart of

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:47.680
values when y equals f of x and the chart of values when y equals f inverse of x are closely

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:55.200
related. They share the same numbers, but the x values for f of x correspond to the y values

01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:02.480
for f inverse of x. And the y values for f of x correspond to the x values for f inverse of x.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:08.800
That leads us to the first key fact, inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.680
I'm going to plot the points for y equals f of x in blue.

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:21.120
Next, I'll plot the points for y equals f inverse of x in red. Pause the video for a moment and see

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:26.320
what kind of symmetry you observe in this graph. How are the blue points related to the red points?

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.800
You might have noticed that the blue points and the red points are mirror images over the mirror

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:42.320
line, y equals x. So our second key fact is that the graph of y equals f inverse of x can be obtained

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:50.800
from the graph of y equals f of x by reflecting over the line y equals x. This makes sense because

01:02:50.800 --> 01:03:00.240
inverses reverse the roles of y and x. In the same example, let's compute f inverse of f of 2.

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:09.280
This open circle means composition. In other words, we're computing f inverse of f of 2. We compute

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:20.080
we compute this from the inside out. So that's f inverse of 3, since f of 2 is 3, and f inverse

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:33.280
of 3, we see as 2. Similarly, we can compute f of f inverse of 3. And that means we take f of f

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:43.200
inverse of 3. Since f inverse of 3 is 2, that's the same thing as computing f of 2, which is 3.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:49.760
Please pause the video for a moment and compute these other compositions.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:04:00.080
You should have found that in every case, if you take f inverse of f of a number, you get back to

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:05.200
the very same number you started with. And similarly, if you take f of f inverse of any number,

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:14.160
you get back to the same number you started with. So in general, f inverse of f of x is equal to x,

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:20.720
and f of f inverse of x is also equal to x. This is the mathematical way of saying that f and

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:28.000
inverse f inverse undo each other. Let's look at a different example. Suppose that f of x is x cubed.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:33.920
Pause the video for a moment and guess what the inverse of f should be. Remember, f inverse undoes

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:43.280
the work that f does. You might have guessed that f inverse of x is going to be the cube root function.

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:52.080
Now we can check that this is true by looking at f of f inverse of x, that's f of the cube root of

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:58.480
of the cube root of function, which means the cube root function cubed, which gets us back to x.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:05.680
Similarly, if we compute f inverse of f of x, that's the cube root of x cubed,

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:12.800
and we get back to x again. So the cube root function really is the inverse of the cubing

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:17.920
function. When we compose the two functions, we get back to the number that we started with.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:25.200
It'd be nice to have a more systematic way of finding inverses of functions besides guessing

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:33.680
and checking. One method uses the fact that inverses reverse the roles of y and x. So if we

01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:40.160
want to find the inverse of the function f of x equals five minus x over three x, we can write it

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:50.800
as y equals five minus x over three x, reverse the roles of y and x to get x equals five minus y

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:58.560
over three y, and then solve for y. To solve for y, let's multiply both sides by three y,

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:07.440
bring all terms with y's in them to the left side, and all terms without y's in them to the

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:22.960
right side, factor out the y and divide to isolate y. This gives us f inverse of x as five over three

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:31.120
x plus one. Notice that our original function f and our inverse function f inverse are both

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:38.240
rational functions, but they're not the reciprocals of each other. And in general, f inverse of x is

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:46.880
not usually equal to one over f of x. This can be confusing, because when we write two to the minus

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:54.960
one, that does mean one over two, but f to the minus one of x means the inverse function and not the

01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:02.880
reciprocal. It's natural to ask if all functions have inverse functions. That is, for any function

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:10.480
you might encounter, is there always a function that is it is its inverse? In fact, the answer is no.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:17.840
See if you can come up with an example of a function that does not have an inverse function.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:24.560
The word function here is key. Remember, that a function is a relationship between x values and y

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:33.840
values, such that for each x value in the domain, there's only one corresponding y value.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:44.640
One example of a function that does not have an inverse function is the function f of x equals x

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:54.160
squared. To see that the inverse of this function is not a function, note that for the x squared

01:07:54.160 --> 01:08:03.440
function, the number two, and the number negative two, both go to the number four. So if I had an

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:11.680
inverse, it would have to send four to both two and negative two. The inverse would not be a function.

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:17.280
It might be easier to understand the problem. When you look at a graph of y equals x squared.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:28.160
Recall that inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x and flip the graph over the line y equals x.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:35.600
But when I flip the green graph over the line y equals x, I get this red graph. This red graph

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:39.920
is not the graph of a function, because it violates the vertical line test.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:46.080
The reason that violates the vertical line test is because the original green function

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:53.840
violates the horizontal line test and has two x values with the same y value.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:01.200
In general, a function f has an inverse function, if and only if the graph of f satisfies the

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:06.960
horizontal line test, i.e. every horizontal line intersects the graph in at most one point.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:13.120
Pause the video for a moment and see which of these four graphs satisfy the horizontal line

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:18.720
test. In other words, which of the four corresponding functions would have an inverse function?

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:28.960
You may have found that graphs a and b violate the horizontal line test. So their functions

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:36.000
would not have inverse functions. But graphs C and D satisfy the horizontal line test. So these

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:43.120
graphs represent functions that do have inverses. Functions that satisfy the horizontal line test

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:50.400
are sometimes called one to one functions. Equivalently, a function is one to one,

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:59.600
if for any two different x values, x one and x two, the y values f of x one and f of x two

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:08.240
are different numbers. Sometimes this is said, f is one to one, if whenever f of x one is equal

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:17.040
to f of x two, then x one has to equal x two. As our last example, let's try to find p inverse

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:24.800
of x, where p of x is the square root of x minus two drawn here. If we graph p inverse on the same

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:31.840
axis as p of x, we get the following graph, simply by flipping over the line y equals x.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:39.440
If we try to solve the problem algebraically, we can write y equal to square root of x minus two,

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:47.840
reverse the roles of y and x and solve for y by squaring both sides and adding two.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:54.880
Now, if we were to graph y equals x squared plus two, that would look like a parabola. It would

01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:02.720
look like the red graph, we've already drawn together with another arm on the left side.

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:08.640
But we know that our actual inverse function consists only of this right arm.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:16.560
We can specify this algebraically by making the restriction that x has to be bigger than or equal

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:25.200
to zero. This corresponds to the fact that on the original graph for the square root of x, y was

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:32.320
only greater than or equal to zero. Looking more closely at the domain and range of p and p inverse,

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:37.600
we know that the domain of p is all values of x such that x minus two is greater than or equal to

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:43.600
zero, since we can't take the square root of a negative number. This corresponds to x values

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.880
being greater than or equal to two, or an interval notation, the interval from two to infinity.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:56.880
The range of p, we can see here is greater than or equal to zero, since we can't take the square

01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:04.720
interval from two to infinity. The range of p, we can see from the graph is all y values greater

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:12.960
than or equal to zero, or the interval from zero to infinity. Similarly, based on the graph,

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:19.600
we see the domain of p inverse is x values greater than or equal to zero, the interval from zero to

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:26.960
infinity, and the range of p inverse is y values greater than or equal to two, or the interval

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:33.360
from two to infinity. If you look closely at these domains and ranges, you'll notice that the domain of

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:41.840
p corresponds exactly to the range of p inverse, and the range of p corresponds to the domain of p

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:51.280
inverse. This makes sense, because inverse functions reverse the rules of y and x. The domain of f

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:58.240
inverse of x is the x values for f inverse, which corresponds to the y values, or the range of f.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:05.680
The range of f inverse is the y values for f inverse, which correspond to the x values, or the

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:13.200
domain of f. In this video, we discussed five key properties of inverse functions.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:26.000
Inverse functions reverse the roles of y and x. The graph of y equals f inverse of x is the graph

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:35.760
of y equals f of x reflected over the line y equals x. When we compose f with f inverse,

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:43.760
we get the identity function y equals x. And similarly, when we compose f inverse with f,

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:48.880
that brings x to x. In other words, f and f inverse undo each other.

01:13:49.280 --> 01:14:01.920
The function f of x has an inverse function, if and only if the graph of y equals f of x

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:15.840
satisfies the horizontal line test. And finally, the domain of f is the range of f inverse,

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:26.400
and the range of f is the domain of f inverse. These properties of inverse functions will be

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:32.080
important when we study exponential functions and their inverses logarithmic functions.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.520
There are different ways of describing the size of an angle. This video explains how to convert

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:50.400
between them. Angles are commonly measured using either degrees or radians. If we're talking about

01:14:50.400 --> 01:15:02.160
degrees, then a full circle by convention is 360 degrees. A half circle then would be 180 degrees.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:09.440
And if I wanted to do say a third of a circle, that would be a third of 360 degrees or 120 degrees.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:16.000
If we're using radians instead, then going all the way around the circle

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:25.280
is called two pi radians. The two pi was chosen because that's the circumference of a circle

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:33.760
with radius of one. A half circle is then half of two pi radians, which is pi radians.

01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:44.160
And if I wanted to do say a quarter of a circle, that would be a quarter of my two pi radians,

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:53.200
a quarter of two pi is pi over two. To convert between degrees and radians, it's handy to use

01:15:53.200 --> 01:16:02.240
the fact that 180 degrees corresponds to pi radians. Both of these represent half of a circle.

01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:09.760
Let's convert negative 135 degrees to radians. Now you might be wondering, what does a negative

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:14.720
angle even mean? Well, by convention, if we go in the counterclockwise direction,

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:24.160
that's considered a positive angle. And if we go in the clockwise direction,

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:32.880
that's considered a negative angle. To convert negative 135 degrees to radians,

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:43.040
I could multiply by pi radians per 180 degrees. Notice that the degrees cancel here. And I end up

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:57.680
with negative 135 pi over 180 radians. That simplifies to negative three pi over four radians.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:08.560
Or if I convert pi to a decimal, that's negative 2.3562 radians up to four decimal places. But

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:15.200
usually if the answer is a simple fraction times pi, it's better to leave it in that form rather

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:21.040
than convert it to a decimal. I can also go the other direction and convert radians to degrees.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:29.920
Five pi over four radians. Now, again, I need to use the fact that pi radians is 180 degrees. But

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:36.160
if I write it like this, with radians on the top, and degrees on the bottom, then the radians won't

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:45.120
cancel. So that doesn't work. Instead, instead, I need to multiply by 180 degrees over pi radians,

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:55.440
so that I can cancel the radians that way, the radians cancel. And I get five pi times 180 over

01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:04.880
four pi degrees. Now the pies also cancel. And this simplifies to 225 degrees. Converting seven

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:12.960
radians to degrees is similar. I need to multiply by 180 degrees over pi radians. If I work out seven

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:22.640
times 180 over pi on my calculator, I get 401.07 degrees up to two decimal places.

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:30.000
Notice that my answer, a little more than 400 is more than 360 degrees. So this is more than a full

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:37.760
circle. That makes sense, since seven radians is more than two pi radians, since pi is itself a

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:44.880
little more than three. Sometimes angles are given in terms of degrees, minutes and seconds, as in

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:59.120
32 degrees, 17 minutes, and 25 seconds. A minute is defined as one sixtieth of a degree.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:07.040
A second is defined as one sixtieth of a minute. But since a minute is itself one sixtieth of a

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:16.320
degree, this is one sixtieth of one sixtieth of a degree, or one over 3600 of a degree.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:23.840
You can also think of this by saying that they're 60 minutes in one degree,

01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:30.880
and they're 3600 seconds in one degree.

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:38.560
Let's convert this number of degrees, minutes and seconds to a decimal number of degrees.

01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:48.080
We know that we have 32 degrees plus 17 minutes plus 25 seconds.

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:56.000
I'm going to copy down the 32 degrees, but I need to convert the minutes to degrees.

01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:02.080
I know that there's 60 minutes in one degree. If I want the units to cancel, I better put the

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:12.000
degrees on the top. So one degree corresponds to 60 minutes. Similarly, if I want to convert

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:21.040
seconds to degrees, 25 seconds, I know that they're 3600 seconds in one degree. I want the degrees to

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:27.280
end up on the top and I want the seconds on the bottom to cancel with the 25 seconds. So I need

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:37.440
to write it this way. Okay, now I can write this as 32 degrees plus 17 over 60 degrees plus 25 over

01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:46.400
3600 degrees. And because the minutes canceled, and the seconds canceled. If I add this all up on

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:56.240
my calculator, I get 32.2903 degrees up to four decimal places. I can also go the other direction

01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:03.280
and convert a decimal number of degrees into degrees minutes and seconds. I'm starting out

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:15.840
with 247 degrees, plus a decimal number of degrees left over. If I want to convert 0.3486

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:23.440
degrees to minutes, well, I know that I have 60 minutes in one degree. This time I want the

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:30.880
minutes on the top and the degrees on the bottom, so that my degrees will cancel. So I just multiply

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:42.880
my decimal by 60. And I end up with 20.916 minutes. Let me copy this down. And now I'm going to take

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:52.800
the 0.916 minutes and convert those to seconds. So I know that they're 60 seconds in one minute.

01:21:53.520 --> 01:22:06.640
So canceling my units again, I just multiply by 60, which gives me 54.96 minutes. I can copy this down

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:16.000
as is, or I can round off my seconds and get 247 degrees, 20 minutes, and 55 seconds.

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:21.520
Converting between different ways of measuring angles is all about unit conversion. To convert

01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:28.720
between radians and degrees, we use the fact that pi radians corresponds to 180 degrees.

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:37.040
To convert between minutes and seconds and degrees, we use the fact that 60 minutes

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:43.360
corresponds to one degree, and 60 seconds corresponds to one minute.

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:54.880
If you have a circle, a piece of the circumference is called an arc. And

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:04.000
a wedge of pi for that circle is called a sector. This video explains how to calculate

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:11.360
the length of the arc and the area of the sector in terms of the angle and the radius of the circle.

01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:18.960
The circumference of a circle is given by the formula, the circumference equals 2 pi

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:27.760
times the radius. Let's use that to solve the following problem. A circular pool has a radius

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:36.160
of 8 meters. Find the arc length spanned by a central angle of 2.5 radians. So this angle

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:43.200
from the center of the circle is supposed to be 2.5 radians. I've drawn the angle as a little bit

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:48.960
less than half the circle because half the circle would be pi radians, which is 3.141 radians.

01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:57.840
So I want to find the length of this arc. I know that the total circumference is going to be 2 pi

01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:05.760
times 8 meters. But I just want a fraction of the circumference. The arc length I want

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:14.720
is going to be given by the fraction of the circle that the angle makes times the circumference of

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:22.880
the circle. The fraction of the circle that I want is given by the ratio of 2.5 radians

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:30.400
over the total number of radians in the circle, which is 2 pi radians. Multiply that by this

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:37.600
circumference, which we said was 2 pi times 8 meters. Notice that the two pies cancel.

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:50.560
And I'm left with just 2.5 times 8 meters, which is 10 meters. In general, the arc length that's

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:57.360
related to the angle it spans by considering the arc length to be the fraction of the circle

01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:04.400
you get by taking the angle over the total angle of the circle of 2 pi times the circumference,

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:11.360
which is 2 pi r. Since the two pies cancel, as they did in our example, that means that arc length

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:21.680
is given by theta times r. Here, r is the radius of the circle. And theta is the angle. It's

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:28.960
important to note that theta needs to be measured in radians, not degrees for this to work. That's

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:35.840
because when I took this ratio, I was using 2 pi radians for the total measure of the circle. So

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:42.160
it's important that theta also be in radians. The area of a circle is given by the formula

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:50.160
pi r squared, where r is the radius. Let's use that fact to find the area of the sector of a

01:25:50.160 --> 01:26:00.720
circle of radius 10 meters that spans an angle of pi over six radians. We know that the total

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:09.920
area of the circle is given by pi times 10 meter squared, or 100 pi meter squared.

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:16.480
But we just want a fraction of that area to give us the area of our sector.

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:27.760
So we want to take the fraction of the circle that the sector makes times the area of the circle.

01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:36.080
Well, the fraction of the circle is given by the angle of pi or six over the total angle in the

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:45.600
whole circle of two pi. And we'll times that by the 100 pi meter squared. That simplifies

01:26:46.560 --> 01:27:00.400
to 100 pi over 12 meters squared, or 25 thirds pi meters squared. As a decimal, that's 26.18

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:07.280
meters squared up to two decimal places. In general, if you want to find the area of a sector,

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:18.320
you can take the fraction of the circle that the sector spans out times the area of the circle

01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:25.920
pi r squared. Notice that the fraction of the circle is given by the angle that the sector makes

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:31.120
in radians, divided by the two pi radians in the circle.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:42.720
Since the pies cancel, we can simplify this formula by saying the area is given by theta

01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:53.120
over two times r squared, where theta is the angle of the sector in radians. Again, it's

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:58.560
important that this angle be in radians, since that's how we're doing our fraction of our circle

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:06.240
comparison. As usual, r represents the radius of the circle. Notice that if you don't have your

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:11.680
angle in radians, if it's in degrees instead, not a big deal, because we can always convert from

01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:19.280
degrees to radians first, before using our formula. In this video, we saw that for a sector of angle

01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:32.320
theta given in radians, the arc length is given by the formula theta times r. And the area of the

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:41.360
sector is given by theta over two times r squared, where r is the radius of the circle. This video

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:48.400
defines linear and radial speed for a rotating circle and explains how to convert between them.

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:59.600
Consider a spinning wheel. The angular speed is the angle it goes through in a unit of time. I can

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:09.360
write that as angle per time. The units will be something like radians per second, if the angle

01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:14.880
is measured in radians and the times measured in seconds, or I guess we could do degrees per minute,

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:24.880
etc. The linear speed is the speed of a point on the rim of the wheel. So that is the distance

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:34.880
a point on the rim of the wheel travels in a unit of time.

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:42.800
I can think of that as distance per time. And so it has units of something like meters per second,

01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:52.880
for example, or it could be feet per minute, etc. Suppose we have a ferrous wheel with radius 20 meters,

01:29:54.880 --> 01:30:02.320
that's making one revolution every two minutes. We want to find its angular speed and the linear

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:10.560
speed of a point on its rim. Now the ferrous wheel is going one revolution every two minutes. So

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:17.920
that's one half revolution per minute. I want to I want to find the angular speed, which is the

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:24.480
angle it goes through in a unit of time. I've already got a unit of time in the denominator

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:30.080
minutes, but I've got to somehow convert revolutions to angle. So my angular speed is

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:38.080
one half revolutions per minute. One revolution, I'll put that on the bottom, so the units will

01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:47.280
cancel out, one revolution is going through an angle of two pi radians. That means my angular speed

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:56.640
is going to be one half times two pi radians per minute, or pi radians per minute. So that's

01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:05.920
the linear speed, the speed of a point on the rim. Well, the wheel is going pi radians per minute.

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:16.800
I got to somehow convert radians into distance. So I know that when I go to pi radians, so that's all

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:23.360
the way around the circle, I'm going all the way around the circle. So I'm going all the way around

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.560
the circle, I'm going all the way around the circumference and distance. So that would be

01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:39.600
two pi times the radius or two pi times 20 meters. The two pies cancel, as do the radians. And I'm

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:49.440
left with 20 pi meters per minute. Let's review how we got from angular speed to linear speed in

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:56.560
order to get a more general formula. I'll call the angular speed, omega looks like a w, and I'll

01:31:56.560 --> 01:32:05.120
call the linear speed V. In the previous problem, we found the linear speed V by starting with the

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:14.000
angular speed, omega, and multiplying it by the circumference divided by two pi. That's because

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:22.240
the point on the rim travels the whole circumference as it goes through an angle of two pi all the way

01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:32.400
around the circle. So I'll write that down here, circumference over two pi. But since I know that

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:39.840
my circumference is given by the formula two pi r, and the two pies cancel, as they did in the

01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:47.680
previous problem, that shows that the linear speed is the angular speed times r, where r is

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:57.200
the radius of the circle. In this video, we defined linear speed and radial speed, and found that

01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:04.480
linear speed was radial speed times the radius of the circle. This video introduces the trig

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:16.320
functions, sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent for right triangles.

01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:29.040
For a right triangle, with sides of length a, b, and c, and an angle theta as drawn, we define

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:40.000
sine of theta as the length of the opposite side over the hypotenuse. The side that's opposite to

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:47.280
our angle theta has measure a and the hypotenuse is this side here with measure C. So that would be

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:56.160
a over C for this triangle. cosine of theta is defined as the length of the adjacent side

01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:03.200
over the length of hypotenuse. This side here is the side adjacent to theta. Of course, the

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:07.360
hypotenuse is also adjacent to theta, but it's special as the hypotenuse. So we don't think of

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:15.760
it as the adjacent side. So that would be b over C tangent of theta is the opposite side length

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:24.000
over the adjacent side length. So that would be a over b. The mnemonic to remember this

01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:37.520
is so catoa, that's sine is opposite over hypotenuse, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse,

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:47.600
and tangent is opposite over adjacent. In fact, there's a relationship between tangent and sine

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:56.720
and cosine, namely, tangent of theta is equal to sine of theta over cosine of theta. If you

01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:04.640
want to see why that's that's because sine of theta over cosine of theta is given by sine,

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:11.440
which is opposite over hypotenuse, divided by cosine, which is adjacent over hypotenuse.

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:17.520
If we compute these fractions by flipping and multiplying

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:27.680
the hypotenuse length cancels, and we just get opposite over adjacent, which is by definition

01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:33.920
tangent of theta. There are three more trig functions that are defined in terms of sine,

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:41.280
cosine and tangent. First of all, they're secant of theta by definition, that's one over

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:48.320
cosine of theta. So it's going to be one over the adjacent over the hypotenuse, which is the

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:54.240
hypotenuse over the adjacent, which in this triangle is C over B.

01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:03.360
cosecant of theta is defined as one over sine theta. So that's one over the opposite

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:09.120
over the hypotenuse, which is the hypotenuse over the opposite. And for this triangle,

01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:17.280
that's going to be C over a. Finally, cotangent of theta is defined as one over tan theta. So

01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:24.720
that's going to be one over opposite over adjacent, flip and multiply, I get adjacent over

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:34.800
opposite for which in this case is B over a. So notice that the values for cotangent,

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:44.080
cosecant and secant are the reciprocals of the values for tangent, sine and cosine, respectively.

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:51.680
Let's use these definitions to find the exact values of all six trig functions for the angle

01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:59.440
theta in this triangle. I'll start with sine of theta, that's opposite over hypotenuse.

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:06.640
Well, for this angle theta, the opposite side is down here and has measured to the hypotenuse

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:16.080
has measure five. So sine theta is two over five. cosine theta is adjacent over hypotenuse,

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:22.800
but I don't know the value of this side length. But fortunately, I can find it using Pythagorean

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:28.160
theorem. So as I have a right triangle here, I know that a squared, I'll call the this side

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:37.040
length a plus b squared, where b is this other leg of the triangle is equal to c squared, where c is

01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:43.440
the hypotenuse. So here I have a squared plus two squared equals five squared, which means that a

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:52.160
squared plus four equals 25, a squared is 21. So a is plus or minus the square root of 21. But

01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:56.640
since I'm talking about the length of a side of a triangle, I can just use the positive answer.

01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:05.200
Returning to my computation of cosine theta, I can write it as adjacent, which is the square root

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:15.120
of 21 over hypotenuse, which is five. tangent theta is the opposite over the adjacent. So that's

01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:25.200
going to be two over the square root of 21. To compute secant of theta, that's one over cosine

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:31.760
theta. So that's going to be one over square root of 21 over five, which is five over the

01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:42.240
square root of 21, the reciprocal of my cosine value. cosecant theta is one over sine theta,

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:49.120
that's going to be the reciprocal of my sine, so five halves. And cotangent theta is one over

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:56.720
tan theta. So it's going to be the reciprocal of my tan value, square root of 21 over two. Finally,

01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:04.000
we'll do an application. So if we have a kite that's flying at an angle of elevation, that's the

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:13.200
angle from the horizontal of 75 degrees, with a kite length string of 100 meters, we want to find

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:23.280
out how high it is. I'll call the height y. Well, we want to relate the known quantities, this angle

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:29.520
and this hypotenuse, to the unknown quantity. The unknown quantity is the opposite side of our

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:40.240
triangle. So if we use sine of theta equals opposite over hypotenuse, then we can relate these known

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:47.600
amounts sine of 75 degrees to our unknown amount y, which is the opposite and our known amount of 100

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:56.080
meters. solving for why this gives that y is 100 meters times sine of 75 degrees, we can use a

01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:03.280
calculator to compute sine of 75 degrees, be sure you use degree mode, and not radiant mode,

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:14.800
when you type in the 75. When I do the computation, I get a final answer of 96.59 meters up to two

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:20.160
decimal places. Notice that we're ignoring the height of the person in this problem.

01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:24.560
To remember the definitions of the trig functions, you can use the mnemonic

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:32.960
Soca Toa, and the fact that secant is the reciprocal of cosine, cosecant the reciprocal of sine,

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:40.480
and cotangent the reciprocal of tangent. In this video, I'll use geometry to compute the sine and

01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:48.960
cosine of a 30 degree angle, a 45 degree angle, and a 60 degree angle. One way to compute the

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:55.760
one way to compute the sine of a 45 degree angle is to use a right triangle with a 45 degree angle.

01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:00.560
This particular right triangle has a hypotenuse of length one.

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:08.560
Since all the angles of the triangle have to add up to 180 degrees, and we already have 90 degrees

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:16.720
and 45 degrees. The remaining angle must also be 45 degrees. So we have an isosceles triangle

01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:23.760
with two sides the same length. I'll call that side length a. If we want sine of 45 degrees,

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:30.160
let's use this 45 degree angle here, then sine is opposite over hypotenuse. So if I can figure

01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:36.320
out how long this side length is, I'll be able to compute sine of 45 degrees. Now the Pythagorean

01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:41.200
theorem says this side length squared plus that side length squared equals the hypotenuse squared.

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:48.960
So we have that a squared plus a squared equals one squared. Alright, that is two a squared equals

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:57.360
one. So a squared is one half, and a is plus or minus the square root of one half. Since we're

01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:01.680
talking about the lengths of sides of triangles, I can just use the positive square root.

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:08.080
It's customary to rewrite this as the square root of one over the square root of two,

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:13.520
which is one over the square root of two, and then rationalize the denominator by multiplying

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:18.240
the top and the bottom by the square root of two. That gives me a square root of two in the numerator,

01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:23.680
and the square root of two squared in the denominator, which is the square root of two over

01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:31.040
two. So these side lengths are the square root of two over two. Now I can figure out the sine

01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:38.880
of 45 degrees by computing the opposite over the hypotenuse. That's, I'm looking at this angle,

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:42.240
so opposite is square root of two over two, hypotenuse is one.

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:53.520
So the sine of 45 degrees is the square root of two over two cosine of 45 degrees is adjacent

01:42:53.520 --> 01:43:00.160
over hypotenuse. That's this side length over this hypotenuse. So that's the square root of two

01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:08.320
over two over one again. What would happen if instead of using this triangle with hypotenuse one,

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:15.200
we use this triangle, also a 45 45 90 triangle, but with hypotenuse five, not quite drawn to scale.

01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:20.480
Please pause the video for a moment and repeat the computation with this triangle.

01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:28.480
This time I'll call the side lengths B, Pythagorean theorem tells me B squared plus B squared equals

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:37.120
five squared. So two B squared equals 25. And B squared equals 25 over two. B is going to be

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:42.640
the plus or minus the square root of 25 over two. Again, I can just use the positive version.

01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:49.680
And so B is the square root of 25 over the square root of two, which is five over the square root of

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:58.800
two rationalizing the denominator, I get five root two over two. Now sine of my 45 degree angle

01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:09.040
is opposite over hypotenuse, which is five square root of two over two divided by five.

01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:16.160
That simplifies to the square root of two over two as before. And a similar computation shows

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:23.840
that cosine of 45 degrees is also squared of two over two as before. This makes sense because

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:30.320
sine and cosine are based on ratios of sides. And since these two triangles are similar triangles,

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:36.960
they'll have the same ratios of sides. To find the sine and cosine of 30 degrees,

01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:44.480
let's use this 30 60 90 right triangle with hypotenuse one. If we double the triangle

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:54.960
we get an angle of 30 here, so a total angle of 60 degrees here. And this angle is also 60 degrees.

01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:00.960
So we have a 60 60 60 triangle, that's an equilateral triangle, all side lengths are the same.

01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:07.360
Since this side length has length one. This side length is also one.

01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:15.440
This entire side length is one, which means the short side of our original triangle has length one

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:22.640
half. Going back to my original triangle, let's use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length

01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:32.560
of its longer side x. Pythagorean theorem says x squared plus one half squared equals one squared.

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:40.480
So x squared plus a fourth equals one x squared is three fourths. And so x is plus or minus the

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:46.800
square root of three fourths, use the positive version, and get the square root of three over the

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:52.960
square root of four, which is the square root of three over two. Now using our original triangle

01:45:52.960 --> 01:46:02.560
again, let's compute the sine of this 30 degree angle here. We know that sine of 30 degrees is

01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:09.520
opposite over hypotenuse. The opposite of this angle is one half and the hypotenuse is one.

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:19.200
So we get a sine of one half over one, which is one half cosine of 30 degrees is adjacent over

01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:27.600
hypotenuse. So that's the square root of three over two divided by one. To find sine of 60 degrees

01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:33.920
and cosine of 60 degrees, we can actually use the same green triangle and just focus on this

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:40.320
upper corner angle of 60 degrees instead. So sine of 60 degrees,

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:48.400
opposite over hypotenuse, but this time the opposite to this angle is a square root of three over two.

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:58.560
Cosine of 60 degrees, adjacent over hypotenuse gives us one half.

01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:07.120
I'll summarize the results in this table below. Notice that a 30 degree angle corresponds to

01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:19.040
pi over six radians since 30 degrees times pi over 180 is pi over six. Similarly, 45 degrees

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:24.080
corresponds to pi over four radians and 60 degrees corresponds to pi over three radians.

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:32.560
I recommend that you memorize the three numbers one half root two over two and root three over two

01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:36.640
and the fact that one half and root three over two go together.

01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:46.560
And root two over two goes with itself. From that information, it's not hard to reconstruct

01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:54.320
the triangles. You know that a 45 45 90 triangle is an isosceles triangle. So it must have

01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:00.400
the side lengths where the same number goes with itself. And a 30 60 90 triangle

01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:08.160
has one side length smaller than the other. So the smaller side must be one half and the

01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:14.160
larger side must be root three over two since root three is bigger than one. And so root three over

01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:21.760
two is bigger than one half. Doing a visual check, you can easily fill in the angles,

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:27.760
the smaller angle must be the 30 degree angle, and the larger one must be the 60 degree one.

01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:34.960
In this video, we computed the sine and cosine of three special angles, 30 degrees,

01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:45.840
45 degrees, and 60 degrees. This video defines sine and cosine in terms of points on the unit

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:55.040
circle. A unit circle is a circle with radius one. Up to now, we define sine and cosine and tangent

01:48:55.040 --> 01:49:01.840
in terms of right triangles. For example, to find sine of 14 degrees in theory, you could draw a

01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:11.680
right triangle with an angle of 14 degrees, and then calculate the sine as the length of the opposite

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:20.640
side over the length of the hypotenuse. But if we use this method to try to compute sine of 120

01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:29.920
degrees, things go horribly wrong. When we draw this 120 degree angle, and this right angle,

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:35.600
there's no way to complete this picture to get a right triangle. So instead, we're going to use a

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:43.040
unit circle, that is, a circle of radius one. The figure below illustrates how right triangles

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:49.120
and the unit circle are related. If you draw right triangles, with larger of hypotenuse one,

01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:55.600
with larger and larger angles, then the top vertex sweeps out part of a unit circle.

01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:02.320
Let's look at this relationship in more detail. In this figure, I've drawn a right triangle

01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:09.920
inside a unit circle. The hypotenuse of the triangle is the radius of the circle, which is one.

01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:17.200
One vertex of the right triangle is at the origin. Another vertex of the right triangle

01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:23.600
is at the edge of the circle. I'm going to call the coordinates of that vertex a

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:34.560
b. Now the base of this right triangle has length a the x coordinate, and the height of the right

01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:44.080
triangle is b the y coordinate. If I use the right triangle definition of sine and cosine of theta,

01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:53.280
this right here is the angle theta, then cosine of theta is adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's

01:50:53.360 --> 01:51:04.080
a over one, or a. Notice that a also represents the x coordinate of this point on the unit circle

01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:12.960
at angle theta from the x axis. I'll write that down. For sine of theta, if I use the right triangle

01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:24.400
definition, that's opposite over hypotenuse. So b over one, which is just b. But b also represents

01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:32.160
the y coordinate of this point in the on the unit circle at angle theta. For tangent theta,

01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:38.480
if we use the right sine triangle definition, it's opposite over adjacent. So that's b over a.

01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:44.160
I can think of that as the y coordinate of the point over the x coordinate of the point.

01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:50.320
Now for angles theta that can't be part of a right triangle, because they're too big,

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:56.960
they're bigger than 90 degrees, like now I'll call this angle here theta. I can still use this

01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:06.480
idea of x and y coordinates to calculate sine and cosine of theta. So if I just mark this point

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:13.200
on the end of this line at angle theta, if I mark that to have coordinates x and y,

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:22.240
then cosine theta, I'm still going to define as the x coordinate of this point, sine theta as the y

01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:29.840
coordinate, and tangent theta as the ratio of the y coordinate over the x coordinate.

01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:37.280
When we use this unit circle definition, we always draw theta starting from the positive x axis

01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:40.400
and going counterclockwise.

01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:49.680
Let's use this unit circle definition to calculate sine cosine and tangent of this angle phi.

01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:57.280
In our figure, we have a unit circle, and these numbers are supposed to represent the x and y

01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:07.440
coordinates of this point on the unit circle at the end point of this line segment that lies at

01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:19.600
angle phi from the positive x axis. Sine phi is equal to the y coordinate. Cosine phi is equal to

01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:25.840
the x coordinate. And tangent of phi is given by the ratio of the two,

01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:32.800
which works out to negative 0.3639 up to four decimal places.

01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:40.560
This video gives a method for calculating sine cosine and tangent in terms of the unit circle.

01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:47.840
Starting from the positive x axis, you draw the angle theta going counterclockwise.

01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:57.200
You look at the coordinates of the point on the unit circle where that angle ends.

01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:06.800
And cosine of that angle theta is the x coordinate, sine of theta is the y coordinate,

01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:15.120
and tangent of theta is the ratio. This video gives three properties of the trig function

01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:18.960
sine and cosine that can be deduced from the unit circle definition.

01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:26.320
Recall that the unit circle definition of sine and cosine for an angle theta

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:35.600
is that cosine theta is the x coordinate, and sine of theta is the y coordinate for the point

01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:44.160
on the unit circle at angle theta. The first property is what I call the periodic property.

01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:52.320
This says that the values of cosine and sine are periodic with period two pi. And what that means

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:58.640
is that if you take cosine of an angle plus two pi, you get the same thing as just if you took

01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:06.320
cosine of the angle. So when we write this down, we're assuming that theta is measured in radians.

01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:13.440
If we want to measure theta in degrees, the similar statement is that cosine of theta plus

01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:20.640
360 degrees is equal to cosine of theta. We can make the same statements for sine,

01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:28.480
sine of an angle plus two pi is equal to sine of the original angle here, the angle being measured

01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:35.440
in radians. If we want to measure the angle in degrees, the statement is that sine of theta plus

01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:43.680
360 is equal to sine of theta. We can see why this is true from the unit circle definition

01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:52.800
of sine and cosine. This is our angle theta, then theta plus two pi, the plus two pi adds

01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:58.160
a full turn around the unit circle to our angle. So we end up at the same place.

01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:04.800
Theta, and theta plus two pi are just two different names for the same location on the unit circle.

01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:10.640
And since sine and cosine give you the y and x coordinates of that point on the unit circle,

01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:18.320
they have to have the same value. Similarly, if we consider an angle theta, and an angle theta

01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:26.240
minus two pi, the minus two pi means we go the other direction around the unit circle, clockwise,

01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:32.240
clockwise, we still end up in the same place. And therefore, cosine of theta minus two pi,

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:39.440
the x coordinate of that position is the same thing as cosine of theta, sine of theta minus two pi

01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:45.120
is the same thing as sine of theta. The same statements hold if we add or subtract multiples

01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:52.000
of two pi, for example, cosine of theta plus four pi is still the same thing as cosine of theta.

01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:58.320
This time, we've just gone two turns around the unit circle and still gotten back to the same place.

01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:07.360
So if we want to find cosine of five pi, that's the same thing as cosine of pi plus four pi,

01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:14.960
which is the same thing as cosine of pi. Thinking about the unit circle, pi is halfway around the

01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:22.640
unit circle. So cosine of pi means the x coordinate of this point right here. Well, that point has

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:30.000
coordinates negative one zero. So cosine of pi must be negative one. If I want to take sine of

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:40.960
negative 420 degrees, or that sine of negative 360 degrees, minus 60 degrees, which is the same thing

01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:49.200
which is the same thing as sine of minus 60 degrees. Thinking about the unit circle, minus 60

01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:57.200
degrees means I start at the positive x axis and go clockwise by 60 degrees. That lands me about

01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:04.960
right here. And so that's one of the special angles that has an x coordinate of one half,

01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:11.760
a y coordinate of negative root three over two. And therefore sine of negative 60 is negative

01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:17.520
root three over two, the y coordinate. The next property I call the even odd property.

01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:25.040
It says that cosine is an even function, which means that cosine of negative theta is the same

01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:33.520
thing as cosine of theta. While sine is an odd function, which means that sine of negative theta

01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:40.480
is the negative of sine of theta. To see why this is true, let's look at an angle theta.

01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:48.080
And the angle negative theta, a negative angle means you go in the clockwise instead of counter

01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:55.600
clockwise direction from the positive x axis. The coordinates of this point by definition

01:58:55.600 --> 01:59:00.080
are cosine theta sine theta, whereas the coordinates of this point

01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:05.360
are cosine negative theta, sine of negative theta.

01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:15.760
But by symmetry, these two points have the exact same x coordinate. And therefore cosine of theta

01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:22.400
must equal cosine of negative theta. While their y coordinates have the same magnitude,

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:25.360
but opposite signs, this one's positive and this one's negative.

01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:31.760
Therefore, sine of negative theta is the negative of sine of theta.

01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:36.640
Let's figure out if tan of theta is an even or odd function.

01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:46.720
Well, we know that tan of negative theta tangent by definition is sine over cosine.

01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:51.840
Well, we know that sine of negative theta is the negative

01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:57.920
of sine of theta, whereas cosine of negative theta is cosine of theta.

01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:08.320
Therefore, we're getting negative sine theta over cosine theta, which is negative tan of theta.

02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:17.280
Since tan of negative theta is the negative of tan of theta, tan theta is an odd function.

02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:23.600
The last property on this video is the Pythagorean property, which says that cosine of theta squared

02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:30.880
plus sine of theta squared is equal to one. A lot of times this property is written with the

02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:39.920
shorthand notation, cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one. But this notation,

02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:48.640
cosine squared theta just means you take cosine of theta and square it. This property is called the

02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:55.040
Pythagorean property because it comes from the Pythagorean theorem. Let me draw a right triangle

02:00:55.040 --> 02:01:01.760
on the unit circle. I'll call this angle theta. So the coordinates of this endpoint here are

02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:07.440
cosine theta, sine theta. Since this is supposed to be a unit circle,

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:13.280
since this is supposed to be a unit circle, the hypotenuse of my right triangle has length one.

02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:20.880
The base of my right triangle is just cosine theta, same thing as the x coordinate of this point.

02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:28.720
And the height of my triangle is the y coordinate of the point sine theta. Now the Pythagorean

02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:35.280
theorem says that this side length squared plus that side length squared equals one squared.

02:01:35.520 --> 02:01:41.200
Since one squared is the same thing as one, that gives me the Pythagorean property.

02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:48.080
The Pythagorean property is handy for computing values of cosine given values of sine and vice

02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:53.920
versa. In this problem, we're told that sine of t is negative two sevenths, and t is an angle that

02:01:53.920 --> 02:02:00.960
lies in quadrant three. When we say the angle lies in quadrant three, that means the terminal

02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:10.240
side of the angle lies here in quadrant three. One way to find cosine of t is to use the fact that

02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:23.280
cosine squared t plus sine squared t is equal to one. That is cosine of t squared plus negative two

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:31.440
seventh squared is equal to one. I can write this as cosine of t squared plus four,

02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:41.120
forty ninths is equal to one. And so cosine of t squared is equal to one minus four forty ninths,

02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:48.960
which is 45, forty ninths. Taking the square root of both sides, that gives me the cosine t

02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:57.040
is plus or minus the square root of 45 over 49. That's plus or minus the square root of 45 over

02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:03.440
seven. Now, since we're in the third quadrant, we know that cosine of t, which represents the x

02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:12.000
coordinate of this point, must also be negative. Therefore, cosine of t is going to be negative

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:19.360
squared of 45 over seven. It's also possible to solve this problem using the Pythagorean

02:03:19.360 --> 02:03:26.000
theorem for right triangles directly. If we look at the fact that sine of t is negative two sevenths

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:31.600
and ignore the negative sign for now, we can think of this information as telling us that we have a

02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:38.960
right triangle angle theta, whose opposite side is two, and whose hypotenuse is seven.

02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:45.920
If we call this side here a, then Pythagorean theorem says this a squared plus two squared

02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:55.200
is seven squared. So a squared plus four is 49. So a squared is 45. And a is plus or minus the

02:03:55.200 --> 02:04:01.840
square root of 45. Since I'm worrying about a triangle, I'm going to use the positive value.

02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:15.280
Now, cosine of t is going to be adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's going to be the square root

02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:23.120
of 45 over seven. Now I go back to thinking about positive and negative signs. And I noticed that

02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:29.920
since I'm in the third quadrant, my cosine needs to be negative. So I just stick a negative sign in

02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:35.520
this alternative solution uses many of the same ideas as the previous solution,

02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:41.360
and ultimately gets us the same answer. This video gives three properties of trig functions.

02:04:42.160 --> 02:04:48.400
The periodic property, the even odd property, and the Pythagorean property.

02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:53.200
This video is about the graphs of sine and cosine.

02:04:53.360 --> 02:05:00.080
I want to graph the functions y equals cosine t and y equals sine t, where t is in radians.

02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:07.280
I'm going to think of this being the t axis, and this being the y axis. One way to do this is to

02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:13.600
plot points. So I'll fill in this chart using my knowledge of special angles on the unit circle.

02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:18.240
These points will be easier to graph if I convert them all to decimals.

02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:25.840
Now I'll plot the points for cosine and connect the dots to get a graph of y equals cosine t from t

02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:33.520
equals zero to t equals two pi. To continue the graph for t values less than zero or bigger than

02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:39.360
two pi, I could plot more points, or I could just use the fact that the cosine values repeat.

02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:46.640
If I add or subtract two pi to the my angle t, I'll be at the same place on the unit circle,

02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:52.640
so my cosine will be exactly the same. Therefore, my values of cosine, which are represented by

02:05:52.640 --> 02:06:00.400
my y values on this graph, repeat themselves. For example, when my t value is two pi plus pi

02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:06.560
over six about like here, it's cosine is the same as the cosine of just pi over six. So I'll

02:06:07.040 --> 02:06:15.120
take this dot here and repeat it over here. Similarly, the one t is like two pi plus pi over

02:06:15.120 --> 02:06:20.480
four, I get the same value of cosine is when it's just pi over four. So this dot is going to repeat.

02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:28.000
And I can continue repeating all my dots. This one repeats over here at two pi plus say pi over

02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:37.920
three. And so my whole graph will repeat something like this. It also repeats on this side, something

02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:46.720
like this. Since subtracting two pi from my t values will also give me the same value of cosine.

02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:53.760
We can also plot points to get a graph for sine and extend it by repetition.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:55.600
And extend it by repetition.

02:06:57.520 --> 02:07:04.800
Going forward, I'll usually write the function sine and cosine as y equals cosine of x and y

02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:13.680
equals sine of x. When I write it this way, notice that x now refers to an angle, while y refers to

02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:21.200
a value of cosine or sine. That's a different meaning of x and y compared to when we're talking

02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:26.960
about the unit circle, where x refers to the cosine value and y refers to the sine value.

02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:31.360
Now let's look at some properties of the graphs of sine and cosine.

02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:38.000
The first thing you might notice is that the graph of cosine and the graph of sine are super

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:43.120
similar to each other. In fact, you can think of the graph of cosine as just being the graph of

02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:52.080
sine shifted to the left by pi over two. So we can write cosine of x as the sine function

02:07:53.120 --> 02:08:02.800
of x plus pi over two, since adding pi over two on the inside moves the graph horizontally to the

02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:10.240
left by pi over two. Or we can think of the graph of sine as being constructed from the

02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:15.920
graph of cosine by shifting the cosine graph right by pi over two. That means we can write sine

02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:23.920
of x as equal to cosine of x minus pi over two, since subtracting pi over two on the inside shifts

02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:31.440
the cosine graph to the right by pi over two. Next, let's look at domain and range. The domain

02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:36.800
of sine and cosine is all real numbers. I'll write that as negative infinity to infinity,

02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:43.680
but the range is just from negative one to one. That makes sense, because sine and cosine come

02:08:43.680 --> 02:08:50.160
from the unit circle. The input values for the domain come from angles. And you can use any

02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:54.560
number as an angle positive negative as big as you want, just by wrapping a lot of times around

02:08:54.560 --> 02:09:00.880
the circle. The output values for the range that is the actual values of sine and cosine come from

02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:05.440
the coordinates on the unit circle. And those coordinates can't be any bigger than one or

02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:11.600
any smaller than negative one. So that gives us our range. As far as even and odd behavior,

02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:17.040
you can tell from the graph, here's cosine, that it's symmetric with respect to the y axis. And so

02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:22.320
it must be even. Whereas the graph of sine is symmetric with respect to the origin and must

02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:29.920
be odd. The absolute maximum values of these two functions is one and the absolute minimum value

02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:37.840
is negative one. We can also use the words midline amplitude and period to describe these

02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:46.000
two functions. The midline is the horizontal line halfway in between the maximum and minimum points.

02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:55.520
Here, the midline is y equals zero. The amplitude is the vertical distance between a maximum point

02:09:55.520 --> 02:10:01.120
and the midline. You can also think of the amplitude as the vertical distance between a

02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:07.360
minimum point and the midline, or as half the vertical distance between a min point and a max

02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:15.280
point. For the cosine function and sine function, the amplitude is one. A periodic function is a

02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:21.040
function that repeats at regular horizontal intervals. The horizontal length of the smallest

02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:30.640
repeating unit is called the period. For y equals cosine of x, the period is two pi. Notice that the

02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:37.280
period is the horizontal distance between successive peaks, or maximum points, or between

02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:47.440
successive troughs, or minimum points. Algebraically, we can write cosine of x plus two pi equals cosine

02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:56.400
of x and sine of x plus two pi equals sine of x to indicate that the functions repeat themselves

02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:04.640
over an interval of two pi and have a period of two pi. In this video, we graphed y equals cosine of x

02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:15.360
and y equals sine of x. And observe that they both have a midline at y equals zero, an amplitude

02:11:16.240 --> 02:11:19.760
of one, and a period of two pi.

02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:28.560
Sine use of all functions are functions that are related to sine and cosine by transformations,

02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:34.720
like stretching and shrinking and shifting. This video is about graphing these functions.

02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:43.120
Let's start by graphing the function y equals three sine of two x. This function is related to

02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:49.360
the function y equals sine x. So I'll graph that first. Now the three on the outside

02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:56.880
stretches this graph vertically by a factor of three. While the two on the inside

02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:04.800
compresses it horizontally by a factor of one half. If instead I want to graph y equals three

02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:11.520
sine two x plus one, this plus one on the outside shifts everything up by one unit.

02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:17.120
Let's compare the midline amplitude.

02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:25.520
And period of our original y equals sine x, our transformed y equals three sine two x and our

02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:32.240
further transformed y equals three sine two x plus one. The original sign has a midline

02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:37.600
at y equals zero, an amplitude of one and a period of two pi.

02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:44.240
For the transformed function, y equals three times sine of two x, the two on the inside

02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:51.440
shrinks everything horizontally by a factor of one half. So it changes the period of two pi

02:12:52.080 --> 02:13:00.960
into a period of one half times two pi, which is pi. Since the two on the inside only affects x values

02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:06.000
and horizontal distances, it doesn't affect the midline, which is a y value, or the amplitude,

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:12.320
which is a vertical distance. But the three on the outside does affect these things. Well, in

02:13:12.320 --> 02:13:17.520
particular, it affects the amplitude, since everything is stretched out vertically by a

02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:23.840
factor of three, the amplitude of one gets stretched to an amplitude of three. Now,

02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:30.160
the midline doesn't actually change because multiplying a y value of zero by three is still a y

02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:38.560
value of zero. Now, on the third function, we've taken the second function and added one on the

02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:43.760
outside. So that shifts everything up by one. Therefore, instead of having a midline at y equals

02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:49.760
zero, we now have a midline at y equals zero. So we have a midline at y equals zero, and we

02:13:49.760 --> 02:13:55.440
therefore, instead of having a midline at y equals zero, we now have a midline at y equals one.

02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:01.040
The amplitude doesn't change, though, it's still three, because shifting everything up by one doesn't

02:14:01.040 --> 02:14:07.680
affect the distance between the midline and the and the maximum point. Also, the period is still

02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:13.280
pi, since the period is a horizontal measure, and adding one on the outside only affects vertical

02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:20.800
things. Next, let's graph the function y equals three times sine of two times quantity x minus

02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:26.800
pi over four. This function is very closely related to the first function we graphed on the previous

02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:36.400
page, that was y equals three sine of two x. In fact, if we give the name f of x to that function,

02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:46.880
and maybe we can call g of x, this other function, then we can get g of x by taking f of x and

02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:57.280
plugging in x minus pi over four in prex. In other words, g of x is f of x minus pi over four.

02:14:58.720 --> 02:15:04.720
This relationship gives me an idea for graphing g of x the function we want to graph. We can first

02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:11.520
graph f of x, we already did that on the previous page, and then we can shift its graph

02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:21.440
to the right by pi over four, because that's what you do when you subtract a number on the

02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:29.600
inside of a function. So here's the graph of y equals three sine two x. Recall that it's just

02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:35.040
the graph of sine stretched vertically by a factor of three and shrunk horizontally by a factor of

02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:42.560
one half. Now to graph the function that I want, I'm going to shift this graph over by pi over four

02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:49.760
to the right. Notice that since I had my function written in factored form, I could just read off

02:15:49.840 --> 02:16:00.880
the horizontal shift. But if I had written it instead, as y equals three sine two x minus pi

02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:07.440
over two, which is algebraically equivalent, it would be easy to get confused and think that I

02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:15.600
needed to shift over by pi over two. So it's best to factor first before figuring out what the shift

02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:21.440
is, we're factoring out the coefficient of x. If instead we wanted to graph this function,

02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:26.880
same as the one we just graphed, it's just with a minus one on the outside, that minus one would

02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:37.120
just bring everything down by one. Let's take a moment to look at midline amplitude and period

02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:45.440
for the original parent function y equals sine of x, and our final transformed function

02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:51.360
y equals three sine of two times quantity x minus pi over four minus one.

02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:58.640
Our original sine function has midline at y equals zero amplitude of one and period of two pi.

02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:06.480
For our transformed function, the three on the outside stretches vertically, so it makes the

02:17:06.480 --> 02:17:17.040
amplitude three. The minus one on the outside shifts everything down by one. So it brings the

02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:25.920
midline y equals zero down to y equals negative one. The two on the inside,

02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:34.480
shrinks everything horizontally by a factor of one half. So the period becomes one half times two

02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:40.560
pi, which is pi. Finally, there's a horizontal shift going on.

02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:52.560
Our transformed function shifts to the right by pi over four. This horizontal shift is sometimes

02:17:52.560 --> 02:18:04.080
called the phase shift. The function we just analyzed was y equals three sine two x minus

02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:13.360
pi over four minus one, which could also be written as y equals three sine two x minus pi over two

02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:21.520
minus one. This is a function of the form y equals a sine b x minus c plus D,

02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:28.560
where B is positive. If we have a function of this form or the similar function with cosine in it,

02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:38.240
then we know that the midline is going to be at y equals D. That's because the original midline of

02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:46.960
sine or cosine at y equals zero gets shifted up by D. We know that the amplitude is going to be

02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:54.400
a because this a multiplied on the outside stretches everything vertically by a factor of a

02:18:55.920 --> 02:19:00.000
to be a little more accurate, we should say the amplitude is the absolute value of a

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:06.720
in case a is negative. If a is negative, then that amounts to a vertical reflection or reflection

02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:14.800
over the x axis. We know that the period of the original sine or cosine is two pi. And we know

02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:22.880
that this factor of B amounts to a horizontal shrink by a factor of one over B, or I guess it

02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:29.520
could be a horizontal stretch by a factor of one over B, if B is less than one. So because we're

02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:37.520
starting with a period of two pi, and we're multiplying by one over B, our new period is going

02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:46.880
to be two pi over B. The trickiest thing is the horizontal shift. And to get that right, I like

02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:57.200
to factor out this B for my equation. So instead of writing y equals a cosine b x minus c plus D,

02:19:57.280 --> 02:20:05.360
I'm going to write y equals a cosine B times quantity x minus C over B plus D. Similarly,

02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:11.920
if it's a sine function, I write y equals a sine B times x minus quantity C over B plus D.

02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:21.120
Then I can read off the horizontal shift as C over B. And that'll be a shift to the right

02:20:21.120 --> 02:20:26.560
if C over B is positive and a shift to the left if C over B is negative. This might seem backwards

02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:29.920
from what you're used to, but it's because we have that minus sign there. So if C over B is

02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:35.440
positive, we're actually subtracting on the inside. So that shifts right, if C of B over B is negative,

02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:39.120
minus a negative is actually adding something. And that's why it shifts it to the left.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:49.440
So as one final example, say I wanted to graph y equals one third cosine of one half x plus

02:20:50.240 --> 02:21:02.400
three minus five, that would have a midline at y equals minus five, an amplitude of one third,

02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:13.520
a period of two pi divided by one half, which is four pi, and a horizontal shift.

02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:23.440
Hmm, better rewrite this. A horizontal shift of six units to the left.

02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:29.200
The horizontal shift is sometimes called the phase shift.

02:21:32.160 --> 02:21:34.640
And that's all for graphs of sine and swivel functions.

02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:41.920
This video is about graphing the trig functions tangent, secant, cotangent and cosecant.

02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:50.080
To gain an intuition for the graph of y equals tangent of x, I think it's handy to look at

02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:59.680
the slope of a line at angle theta on the unit circle. The slope of this line is the rise over

02:21:59.680 --> 02:22:10.000
the run. But the rise is given by sine of theta. And the run is given by cosine of theta. So the

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:21.440
slope is given by sine theta over cosine theta, which is simply tan of theta. So if I want to graph

02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:31.520
y equals tan of x, I can think of x as being the angle and y as being the slope of the line

02:22:32.480 --> 02:22:45.520
at that angle. Notice that if the angle is zero, the slope is zero. But as the angle increases

02:22:46.640 --> 02:22:52.480
towards pi over two, the slope gets bigger and bigger heading towards infinity.

02:22:52.480 --> 02:23:03.520
As the angle goes from zero towards negative pi over two, the slope is getting negative

02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:10.240
and heading towards negative infinity. At exactly pi over two and negative pi over two,

02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:16.240
we have a vertical line. And so the slope is undefined.

02:23:16.240 --> 02:23:25.040
Using this information, let's graph a rough sketch of y equals tan x. Remember, we're thinking of x

02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:33.760
as the angle and y as the slope, we're going to go between an angle of negative pi over two and pi over

02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:42.800
two. So we said that the slope was zero, when the angle is zero, and then it heads up towards

02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:49.120
positive infinity as we go towards the angle goes towards pi over two with an undefined value

02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:55.040
at pi over two, it goes negative heading towards negative infinity as the angle heads towards

02:23:55.040 --> 02:24:01.760
negative pi over two, also with an undefined value at negative pi over two. You can also verify

02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:07.600
that for angles slightly bigger than pi over two, we have the same line

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:16.240
as for angles that are approaching negative pi over two. And therefore, this picture repeats.

02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:23.120
And it turns out that tangent is periodic

02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:26.960
with period

02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:36.480
not two pi like sine and cosine, but just pi. The period of pi makes sense because if you take

02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:43.600
a line and rotate it by 180 degrees, it's the same line with the same slope and therefore has the

02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:52.080
same value of tangent. In this graph of y equals tan x, notice that the x intercepts

02:24:53.840 --> 02:25:03.520
are at values of x of the form negative two pi negative pi zero pi two pi, etc.

02:25:04.400 --> 02:25:13.680
You can write that as pi times k, where k is an integer, that is a positive or negative

02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:22.880
whole number or zero. This makes a lot of sense because tangent of x is sine of x over cosine

02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:29.200
of x. And so you're going to get x intercepts. That's where y is zero, which is where the

02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:39.760
numerator is zero. And sine x is zero at values of the form pi to pi, and so on.

02:25:41.440 --> 02:25:46.240
From the graph, you can see the vertical asymptotes are at values like negative three pi over two,

02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:53.920
negative pi over two, pi over two, and three pi over two. These values can be written as

02:25:53.920 --> 02:26:02.880
pi over two times k, where k is an odd integer. Again, this makes sense from the definition

02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:09.360
of tangent since the vertical asymptotes will occur where the denominator is zero and cosine x is

02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:18.000
zero at numbers like negative pi over two, pi over two, three pi over two, and so on. The domain of

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:22.720
tangent is the exact case for which it's defined. So that's going to be everything except for the

02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:30.720
vertical asymptotes, we can write that as x such that x is not equal to pi over two times k for k

02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:39.120
and odd integer. The range or the y values go all the way from negative infinity to infinity.

02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:47.360
And the period as we mentioned previously is pi. Since the smallest repeating unit

02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:57.120
has a horizontal width of pi. To graph y equals secant x, I'm going to remember that secant

02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:06.960
is one over cosine. So if I start with a graph of cosine, I can take the reciprocal of the y values

02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:15.200
to get the graph of secant. The reciprocal of one is one, the reciprocal of zero is undefined. So

02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:23.520
I'm not going to have a value at pi over two, negative pi over two, three pi over two, or negative

02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:29.440
three pi over two. When I take the reciprocal of numbers, just less than one, I'm going to get

02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:35.280
numbers just greater than one. But if I take the reciprocal of positive numbers, getting close to

02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:43.280
zero, I'm going to get really big positive numbers going up towards infinity. Similarly, on the other

02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:51.600
side. Over here, I have numbers close to zero but negative. So their reciprocals will be negative

02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:58.000
numbers heading towards negative infinity. The reciprocal of negative one is negative one.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:04.640
And similarly here. So I'm getting kind of positive and negative buckets and upside down

02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:14.960
buckets as the graph of my secant. Notice that secant has a period of two pi, which makes sense

02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:22.000
since cosine has a period of two pi. It has a range that goes from negative infinity to negative one

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:28.080
inclusive. And from one to infinity, that makes sense because the range of cosine is between

02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:34.960
one and negative one. And we're taking the reciprocal of those values. The domain is everything

02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:39.440
except for the vertical asymptotes. Now the vertical asymptotes are where cosine is zero.

02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:52.960
So that is at values of the form pi over two, three pi over two, etc. That's values of the form

02:28:52.960 --> 02:29:03.360
pi over two k, where k is an odd integer. So the domain is going to be x values such that x is not

02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:14.080
equal to pi over two k, for k, an odd integer. The x intercepts of secant, well, it doesn't have any,

02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:20.160
because you can't take one over something and get the number zero for your y value.

02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:33.040
We've seen the graphs of y equals tan x, and y equals secant x. This is the graph of y equals

02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:39.520
cotangent x. It looks similar to the graph of tangent x is just a decreasing function instead

02:29:39.520 --> 02:29:46.640
of an increasing one, and it has its vertical asymptotes, and its x intercepts in different places.

02:29:46.640 --> 02:29:57.120
Finally, this green graph is the graph of y equals cosecant x. It's related to the graph

02:29:57.120 --> 02:30:05.120
of sine x since cosecant is one over sine x. And in fact, if I draw the graph of sine x in between,

02:30:05.120 --> 02:30:09.440
you can see how it kind of bounces off because it's the reciprocal.

02:30:11.760 --> 02:30:16.080
I encourage you to memorize the general shape of these graphs. You can always figure out the

02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:26.720
details by thinking about how they're related to the graphs of cosine of x and sine x.

02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:36.640
This video is about the graphs of transformations of tangent secant cotangent cosecant. Before I

02:30:36.640 --> 02:30:44.000
graph this fancy function, I'm going to graph the related parent function y equals cosecant of x.

02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:54.080
Recall that cosecant of x is one over sine of x. So the graph of cosecant of x has a vertical

02:30:54.080 --> 02:31:04.480
asymptotes where sine of x is zero. That puts the vertical asymptotes at pi to pi, zero, and so on.

02:31:05.200 --> 02:31:13.520
Cosecant of x is one where sine is one. So here. And so it looks something like this.

02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:21.280
Now, when I graph my fancy function, I know that the two on the outside does a vertical stretch

02:31:21.680 --> 02:31:35.280
by two, the plus one shifts up by one. The pi means everything shrinks horizontally

02:31:37.120 --> 02:31:44.080
by one over pi. And so the period, instead of being two pi, like it is for cosecant,

02:31:44.080 --> 02:31:52.880
it's going to be two pi divided by pi, which is two. Finally, this pi over two has to do with a

02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:59.280
horizontal shift. But in order to see by how much we horizontal shift, we need to factor out the pi

02:31:59.280 --> 02:32:09.360
first. So if I rewrite my function as two times cosecant pi times x plus a half plus one, I can

02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:16.400
see that the horizontal shift is one half to the left. Let me do those transformations in pieces.

02:32:16.400 --> 02:32:23.280
First, I'll do the vertical motions. So I'll leave the horizontal axis as is. I'll stretch by a factor

02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:31.680
of two. And now I'll shift up by one. Next, I'll worry about the horizontal motion. Instead of a

02:32:31.680 --> 02:32:38.640
period of two pi, I'm going to have a period of two. But in addition, everything is going to be

02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:47.120
shifted left by one half. So instead of having my vertical asymptotes at zero pi, two pi, and so on,

02:32:47.120 --> 02:33:00.800
they would be at zero, one, two, and so on, except everything's shifted over by one half. So that

02:33:00.800 --> 02:33:11.200
means the vertical asymptotes will actually be at negative a half, a half, one and a half, and so

02:33:11.200 --> 02:33:21.920
on. Another way to find the vertical asymptotes is by noting that cosecant is one over a sign. So

02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:37.760
therefore, cosecant pi x plus one half does not exist when sine pi x plus one half equals zero,

02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:51.120
i.e. when pi times x plus one half is equal to a multiple of pi. Canceling the pies and solving

02:33:51.120 --> 02:34:02.640
for x, that's when x is some number minus a half. So those are exactly the values of say one half,

02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:08.320
three halves, five halves, and so on that we've drawn. So once we've got the vertical asymptotes in

02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:17.120
place, we can see that our graph fits in between them. This purple piece got shrunk horizontally

02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:23.200
and shifted by a half. So it ends up hugging the x axis. I'll draw it in right here.

02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:31.680
And all the other pieces also get shrunk horizontally and shifted. So my final graph

02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:40.560
looks something like this. In this next problem, we're given the graph and we need to find the

02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:47.440
equation. The shape of the graph and the fact that it's increasing tells us it must be a tangent

02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:59.120
graph. But y equals tan x by itself would have a period of pi. Let's check what our graph has a

02:34:59.120 --> 02:35:06.640
period of. We need to find the horizontal width of one complete cycle. It's probably easiest to

02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:13.680
measure if I sketch in the vertical asymptotes, which seem to run from an x value of negative three

02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:21.120
to an x value of one. So that's a horizontal distance of four. So our graph might be something

02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:35.440
more like tan of b x, where pi over b has to be four. That means that pi equals four b. And so b is

02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:42.880
pi over four. So our graph is probably more closely related to y equals tan of pi over four x.

02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:52.320
But if it were exactly y equals tan of pi over four x, then that middle point right here would be at

02:35:52.320 --> 02:36:00.720
the origin. And instead, that middle point is at negative one one. That means my tangent graph is

02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:12.480
is shifted left by one and up by one. The left by one I can accomplish by writing x plus one,

02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:20.080
when I have the pi over four factored out the up by one, I get by writing a plus one on the outside.

02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:27.360
Now, it's possible there might also be a vertical stretch factor out front. An easy way to check for

02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:33.920
that is by plugging in x equals zero, and seeing whether what kind of number out in front I might

02:36:33.920 --> 02:36:43.040
need to get this y intercept of two. So I'm going to write y equals a tan pi over four quantity x plus

02:36:43.040 --> 02:36:56.720
one plus one, plug in the point zero two. So that's two equals a tan pi over four zero plus one plus

02:36:56.720 --> 02:37:08.160
one. And I can solve for a since tan of pi over four is just one, this equation simplifies to two

02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:16.320
equals a times one plus one, which means that a has to be one. So in fact, this equation here is our

02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:25.040
final answer for this graph. To summarize, if we have a function of the form y equals a tan bx minus

02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:37.680
c plus D, the number a accomplishes a vertical stretch. The number B changes the period

02:37:37.920 --> 02:37:55.920
from pi to pi over B, the number D shifts vertically by D. And finally, to figure out what the number C

02:37:55.920 --> 02:38:05.600
is, we have to rewrite our equation in factored form factoring out the B. And so we see that there's

02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:18.400
a phase shift right by C over B. The same things hold if instead of tangent, we have a graph of

02:38:18.400 --> 02:38:26.400
cotangent. We can say the same things for a graph of secant and a graph of cosecant. The only thing

02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:39.200
to be careful of is that B now changes the period from two pi to two pi over B, simply because the

02:38:39.200 --> 02:38:53.440
original period of secant and cosecant is two pi, whereas the original period of tan and cotan is just

02:38:53.440 --> 02:39:01.040
pi. If you know what the original graphs of tan secant cotangent and cosecant look like, you can

02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:08.800
use your knowledge of transformations to graph more complicated functions. This video defines the

02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:19.760
standard inverse trig functions, sine inverse, cosine inverse, and tan inverse. In this crazy

02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:25.440
looking graph, please focus first on the thin black line. This is a graph of y equals sine x.

02:39:26.720 --> 02:39:32.240
The graph of the inverse of a function can be found by flipping the graph of the original function

02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:38.320
over the line y equals x. I've drawn the flipped graph with this blue dotted line.

02:39:39.760 --> 02:39:44.400
But you'll notice that the blue dotted line is not the graph of a function because it violates the

02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:52.080
vertical line test. So in order to get a function that's the inverse of y equals sine x, we need to

02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:59.840
restrict the domain of sine of x. We'll restrict it to this piece that's drawn with a thick black line.

02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:06.160
If I invert that piece by flipping it over the line y equals x, I get the piece drawn

02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:12.240
with a red dotted line here. And that piece does satisfy the vertical line test. So it is in fact

02:40:12.240 --> 02:40:19.920
a function. Although regular sine x has domain from negative infinity to infinity, our restricted

02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:30.480
sine x has domain from negative pi over two to pi over two. It's, it's range is still from negative

02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:36.240
one to one, just like the regular sine x, because I've taken the biggest possible piece

02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:43.040
of the graph, whose flipped version is still a function. The inverse sine function

02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:52.320
is often written as arc sine of x. And since inverting a function reverses the roles of y and x,

02:40:52.880 --> 02:41:00.320
it reverses the domain and the range. So arc sine of x, the inverse function has domain

02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:05.120
from negative one to one and range from negative pi over two to pi over two,

02:41:06.320 --> 02:41:12.720
which seems plausible from the graph. Now an inverse function undoes the work of a function.

02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:19.200
So if the function sine takes angles theta to numbers x,

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:28.640
then the inverse sine or arc sine takes numbers x to angles theta.

02:41:31.280 --> 02:41:38.640
For example, since sine of pi over two is one arc sine of one is pi over two.

02:41:40.480 --> 02:41:47.520
And in general, the output of arc sine of x is the angle between negative pi over two and pi over

02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:59.120
two, whose sine is x. y is equal to arc sine x means that x is equal to sine of y. But since

02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:05.040
there are many angles y whose sine is x, right, they all differ by multiples of two pi, we specify

02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:13.120
also that y is between negative pi over two and pi over two. That was the whole point of doing this

02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:20.400
domain restriction in order to get a well defined inverse value. There's an alternate notation

02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:24.800
for inverse sine. Sometimes it's written as sine to the negative one of x.

02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:35.280
But this notation can be confusing. So be careful. In particular, sine to the negative one of x

02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:43.760
does not equal one over sine of x. One over sine of x, the reciprocal function is another word for

02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:52.160
cosecant of x. But sine to the negative one of x is another word for arc sine of x, the inverse

02:42:53.040 --> 02:42:55.920
which is not the same thing as the reciprocal function.

02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:02.240
Let's go through the same process to build an inverse cosine function.

02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:10.400
We start with a graph of cosine of x. We flip it over the line y equals x to get the blue dotted

02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:16.160
line. But the blue dotted line is not a function. So we go back and restrict the domain for our

02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:24.800
original cosine of x to just be between zero and pi. The resulting red graph now satisfies the

02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:30.960
vertical line test. So it's a proper inverse function. Our restricted cosine has domain from

02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:40.880
zero to pi and range from negative one to one. And so our inverse function arc cosine has domain

02:43:40.880 --> 02:43:49.600
from negative one to one and range from zero to pi. Since cosine takes us from angles to numbers,

02:43:51.040 --> 02:44:00.240
arc cosine takes us from numbers back to angles. For example, cosine of pi over four is a square

02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:07.520
root of two over two. So arc cosine of the square root of two over two is equal to pi over four.

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:17.680
Arc cosine of x is the angle between zero and pi whose cosine is x.

02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:26.160
In other words, y equals arc cosine of x means that x is equal to cosine of y.

02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:34.720
And y is between zero and pi. Since otherwise there'd be lots of possible answers for an angle y

02:44:34.720 --> 02:44:41.200
whose cosine is x. The alternative notation for arc cosine is cosine inverse.

02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:50.000
And again, we have to be careful. Cosine to the negative one x is not the same thing

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:55.520
as one over cosine of x. One over cosine of x is also called secant of x.

02:44:56.800 --> 02:45:03.920
Cosine to the negative one x means arc cosine, the inverse function, and these two things are not the

02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:13.920
same. Finally, let's take a look at inverse tangent function. Here's a graph of tangent

02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:19.920
in black, these vertical lines aren't really part of the function, they're just vertical asymptotes.

02:45:20.880 --> 02:45:26.640
So in order to get an actual function, when we flip over the line y equals x,

02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:32.960
we take just one piece of the tangent function. Here we've taken the piece marked in black.

02:45:33.920 --> 02:45:40.800
When we flip that over the line y equals x, we get this piece in red, which is actually a function

02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:47.280
because it satisfies the vertical line test. Now you might ask, would it be possible to pick

02:45:47.280 --> 02:45:54.240
a different piece of the tangent function to invert? And the answer is yes, we could do that.

02:45:54.240 --> 02:46:00.000
And on another planet, maybe mathematicians do that. But on our planet, we use the convention

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:07.280
that we pick this piece of tangent to invert, which is kind of a convenient choice since it's

02:46:07.840 --> 02:46:14.160
centered here around the origin. In the previous two examples, our choice of restricted domain for

02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:19.680
sine and per cosine was also a convention that led to a conveniently defined inverse function.

02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:28.240
In any case, based on our choice, our restricted tan function has domain from negative pi over two

02:46:28.880 --> 02:46:34.960
to pi over two. We don't include the endpoints in that interval, because our restricted tan

02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:40.640
function has vertical asymptotes at negative pi over two, pi over two, so it's not defined there.

02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:47.520
The range of our restricted tan function is from negative infinity to infinity.

02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:56.640
Therefore, arc tan of x has domain from negative infinity to infinity and range

02:46:56.640 --> 02:47:04.400
from negative pi over two to pi over two. Once again, tangent is taking us from angles

02:47:04.400 --> 02:47:14.560
to numbers. So arc tan is taking us from numbers to angles. For example, tangent of pi over four

02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:27.840
is one. And therefore arc tan of one is pi over four. So arc tan of x means the angle between

02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:38.960
negative pi over two and pi over two, whose tangent is x. y is equal to arc tan x means that x is

02:47:38.960 --> 02:47:48.080
equal to tangent of y. And that y is between negative pi over two and pi over two.

02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:58.560
The inverse tan function can also be written as tan to the minus one of x. And once again,

02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:13.600
tan inverse of x means the inverse trig function arc tan of x. And it's not equal to one over

02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:17.440
tan of x, which is called cotangent of x.

02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:25.680
And that's all for this video on the three basic inverse trig functions.

02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:34.960
Sin inverse x, also known as arc sine of x, cosine inverse x, also known as arc cosine x and tan

02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:43.200
inverse x, also known as arc tan x. This video is an introduction to solving trig equations.

02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:50.560
Let's start with the equation to cosine x plus one equals zero. I want to find all the solutions

02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:56.480
in the interval from zero to two pi, and then get a general formula for all solutions, not just

02:48:56.480 --> 02:49:04.000
those in that interval. Let me start by rewriting this equation to isolate the tricky part, which is

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:13.040
cosine of x. So I'm going to write two cosine x equals negative one, and then divide both sides

02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:21.760
by two. Now I'm looking for the angles x between zero and two pi, whose cosine is negative one half.

02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:27.520
Since negative one half is one of the special values on the unit circle,

02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:35.760
I can use my knowledge of the unit circle to see that the angle between zero and two pi

02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:46.160
must be either two pi over three, or four pi over three. My answer needs to include both of these

02:49:46.160 --> 02:49:52.960
values. There are no other spots on the unit circle whose cosine is negative one half. But there are

02:49:52.960 --> 02:49:58.720
more angles, because we can always take one of these angles and add multiples of two pi to it.

02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:04.160
So if I want to find all solutions, I can take these two principle solutions,

02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:11.200
two pi over three, and four pi over three, and simply add multiples of two pi to them.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:20.000
For example, two pi over three plus two pi or two pi over three minus two pi, two pi over three plus

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:29.760
four pi, and so on. A much more efficient way to write this is to write two pi over three plus

02:50:30.480 --> 02:50:40.320
two pi times K, for K, any integer, that is any positive or negative whole number or zero.

02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:45.680
Similarly, I can write four pi over three plus two pi K

02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:52.480
to capture all solutions based on the principle solution four pi over three by adding and

02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:56.960
subtracting multiples of two pi. This is my final solution.

02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:06.720
Next, let's look at a Triggy equation involving tangent. As usual, I'm going to start out by

02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:10.560
cleaning things up and isolating the tricky part, which in this case is tangent.

02:51:11.200 --> 02:51:22.000
So let me add tangent to both sides. That'll give me three tan x equals the square root of three.

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:28.880
And so tan x is the square root of three over three. The square root of three over three looks

02:51:28.880 --> 02:51:34.480
suspiciously similar to value the value of square root of three over two, which is a special value

02:51:34.480 --> 02:51:41.120
on my unit circle. So my suspicion is that my unit circle will again help me find this value of x

02:51:41.120 --> 02:51:52.320
without a calculator. Recall that tan x is sine x over cosine x. So I'm looking for angles on the

02:51:52.320 --> 02:51:57.440
unit circle between zero and two pi, where the ratio of sine over cosine will give me

02:51:58.240 --> 02:52:05.040
square root of three over three. I actually only need to look in the first quadrant and the third

02:52:05.040 --> 02:52:10.960
quadrant, because those are the quadrants where tangent is positive. And I really only need to

02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:19.280
look at angles whose either sine or cosine has a square root of three in it. So by trial and error,

02:52:19.280 --> 02:52:30.720
I can see that tan pi over six, which is sine pi over six over cosine pi over six,

02:52:31.600 --> 02:52:38.880
will give me one half over root three over two. That's the same thing as one half times two over

02:52:38.880 --> 02:52:45.760
root three, which is one over root three. If I rationalize that, I get root three over three.

02:52:45.760 --> 02:52:52.720
So that value works. If I try tan of pi over three instead,

02:52:54.400 --> 02:53:00.560
I get root three, which is not equal to root three over three. So pi over three doesn't work.

02:53:01.360 --> 02:53:10.080
Similarly, I can work out some the values in the third quadrant, and see that seven pi over six

02:53:10.080 --> 02:53:19.280
works. But four pi over three does not. So my answer to part a includes just the two values,

02:53:20.400 --> 02:53:29.440
pi over six, and seven pi over six. Now, if I want to find all solutions, not just those

02:53:29.440 --> 02:53:34.880
in the interval from zero to two pi, I noticed that I can take one of these principal solutions,

02:53:35.440 --> 02:53:39.440
and add multiples of two pi to it, because that'll give me the same angle.

02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:52.320
So I get pi over six plus two pi k, and pi over six, sorry, seven pi over six plus two pi k for

02:53:53.440 --> 02:54:01.280
k, any integer. This is a correct answer, but it's not as simple as it could be.

02:54:02.240 --> 02:54:09.440
Notice that seven pi over six over here on the unit circle is exactly pi more than pi over six.

02:54:09.440 --> 02:54:14.000
So instead of taking both of these and adding multiples of two pi to them,

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:19.280
I could get all the same answers by just taking one of them and adding multiples of pi to it.

02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:28.320
So a more efficient answer is to say that x equals pi over six plus pi times k

02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:36.960
for k, any integer. This will still capture all the same solutions, because when k is even,

02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:43.680
I'll get this family of solutions. And when k is odd, I'll get this family. For example, when k is one,

02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:49.840
pi over six plus one times pi is just the original seven pi over six.

02:54:51.360 --> 02:54:57.360
If you think about the fact that tangent has a period of pi, instead of two pi, it makes a lot

02:54:57.360 --> 02:55:03.920
of sense that you should be able to write the solutions in this form. In this video,

02:55:03.920 --> 02:55:13.360
we solved basic trig equations by first isolating sine or tangent, or the same thing would work

02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:22.080
with cosine, and then using the unit circle to find principal solutions.

02:55:23.040 --> 02:55:28.640
Principal solutions are just solutions between zero and two pi.

02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:40.160
And then adding multiples of two pi to these principal solutions to get all solutions.

02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:45.840
For tangent, we notice that it was equivalent to just use one principal solution

02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:53.840
and add multiples of pi instead of two pi. In a previous video, we looked at trig equations

02:55:53.840 --> 02:55:59.520
that could be solved using the unit circle. In this video, we'll solve trig equations that

02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:04.720
don't involve special values on the unit circle, and require a calculator instead to solve.

02:56:06.480 --> 02:56:10.800
Let's look at the equation to cosine t equals one minus cosine t.

02:56:11.040 --> 02:56:17.280
As usual, I'll start by simplifying and isolating cosine. Adding cosine to both sides, I get three

02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:26.160
cosine t equals one, dividing by three gives cosine t equals one third. Now, one third is not one of

02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:34.640
my special values on the unit circle. But I can locate it approximately, cosine represents the x

02:56:34.640 --> 02:56:39.920
value of a point on the unit circle. So I'm looking for a point on the universe circle whose x

02:56:40.880 --> 02:56:48.160
coordinate is approximately one third. So maybe right here, and the symmetric angle right here,

02:56:48.160 --> 02:56:54.000
those are angles in the first and fourth quadrants. To get a decimal approximation

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:58.560
for one of these angles, I can take our cosine of both sides of my equation.

02:57:00.240 --> 02:57:07.680
This gives me t equals our cosine of one third, which using my calculator on radian mode,

02:57:07.760 --> 02:57:15.920
I get a decimal approximation of 1.2310 up to four decimal places. It's important to use

02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:23.920
radian mode here. Since by convention, the answers to trig equations are expected to be in radians

02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:31.280
unless otherwise specified. It's also important to notice that these two equations are not precisely

02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:37.920
the same thing. Since cosine t equals one third has infinitely many solutions.

02:57:39.360 --> 02:57:43.760
If we don't restrict to a certain interval, and even if we restrict to the interval zero to two

02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:51.680
pi, it still has two different solutions. On the other hand, our t equals our cosine of one third

02:57:52.320 --> 02:58:01.520
has only one solution. And that solution lies between the angles of zero and pi.

02:58:02.880 --> 02:58:09.600
So this angle here, the 1.2310 radians must be giving us this angle, since it's got to be an

02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:16.560
angle between zero and pi. And to get the other angle, this one, we can use the symmetry of the

02:58:16.560 --> 02:58:24.320
situation. This angle and this angle are the same size. So to get all the way around to here,

02:58:24.320 --> 02:58:33.280
we can go all the way to pi minus our 1.2310 radians. Using our calculator again, we can compute

02:58:33.280 --> 02:58:45.280
that two pi minus 1.2310 radians is equal to 5.0522 radians. So our two solutions on our interval

02:58:45.280 --> 02:58:57.600
from zero to two pi are given by 1.2310 and 5.0522 radians. Let me emphasize that we found the

02:58:57.600 --> 02:59:08.560
second solution by taking two pi minus the first solution. Now it's straightforward to find all

02:59:08.560 --> 02:59:15.280
solutions. We can just take our two principal solutions and add multiples of two pi.

02:59:17.520 --> 02:59:20.320
It could be helpful to look at this solution graphically.

02:59:21.360 --> 02:59:28.160
To solve our equation cosine t equals one third, we want to know where this graph

02:59:29.440 --> 02:59:36.000
of y equals cosine of t intersects the horizontal line at y equals one third.

02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:44.640
This intersection point here corresponds to our first solution of 1.2310 radians.

02:59:45.600 --> 02:59:52.480
This intersection point here corresponds to our second solution. Notice that it occurs at a t

02:59:52.480 --> 03:00:01.920
value that's two pi minus this t value here. And all the other intersection points correspond to

03:00:01.920 --> 03:00:10.160
those first two intersection points shifted over by multiples of two pi. Next, let's look at the

03:00:10.160 --> 03:00:20.320
equation for sine x minus one equals two. I'll start by rewriting this as four sine x equals three,

03:00:20.320 --> 03:00:27.040
which is equivalent to sine x equals three fourths. Although three fourths is not a special value on

03:00:27.040 --> 03:00:32.320
the unit circle, we can still use the unit circle to get oriented and see how many solutions

03:00:32.320 --> 03:00:38.320
there should be in the interval from zero to two pi. Since sine represents the y coordinate of a

03:00:38.320 --> 03:00:42.720
point on the unit circle, we're looking for points on the unit circle whose y coordinate is three

03:00:42.720 --> 03:00:48.240
fourths. So that might be three fourths might be about here. So that would be an angle about right

03:00:48.240 --> 03:00:57.680
here, and about right here. So in the first and second quadrants. Let's take the arc sine of both

03:00:57.680 --> 03:01:06.400
sides to find one of those angles. I'm getting one of the angles to be arc sine of three fourths,

03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:16.560
which my calculator says is 0.8481 radians. That must be this angle here. To get the other angle,

03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:26.560
I can use symmetry. Since this angle here, you can get by going a full pi minus my previous angle.

03:01:28.000 --> 03:01:36.160
Pi minus 0.8481 is equal to 2.2935. So that's my second angle.

03:01:38.000 --> 03:01:45.040
Notice that this time, to get the second angle, we use pi minus the first angle.

03:01:45.200 --> 03:01:51.440
Not to pi minus the first angle, like we did for cosine. Once again, we can find all solutions

03:01:51.440 --> 03:01:58.960
simply by adding multiples of two pi. We can also locate these solutions on a graph of sine.

03:01:59.920 --> 03:02:08.000
We're looking for where the graph of y equals sine of x intersects with the horizontal line at y

03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:14.320
equals three fourths. And we can see that we have these two solutions.

03:02:17.520 --> 03:02:24.880
Where the second one, its x value is pi minus the x value of this one. And then we have all these

03:02:24.880 --> 03:02:31.520
additional solutions that we can get by shifting over by positive and negative multiples of two

03:02:31.520 --> 03:02:37.760
pi from the first two. Finally, let's solve the equation tan x equals four.

03:02:39.280 --> 03:02:43.280
If we simply take x to be tan inverse of four,

03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:50.800
which is 1.3258 radians, we'll get a single solution.

03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:59.680
But thinking about the graph of tangent and intersecting that graph with the horizontal

03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:09.760
line y equals four, we see that there should actually be two solutions in the interval from zero

03:03:09.760 --> 03:03:16.240
to two pi. This makes sense because the period of tangent is pi.

03:03:18.240 --> 03:03:26.000
So any one solution will get repeated by intervals of pi. It also makes sense by thinking about the

03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:34.880
unit circle tangent, which can be thought of as the slope of a line at angle theta takes on all

03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:41.440
positive real values, both in the first quadrant and the third quadrant. So there are going to be

03:03:41.440 --> 03:03:48.080
two places on the unit circle where the tangent is four. We've already found this one.

03:03:49.200 --> 03:03:51.760
To find the other one, we just need to add pi.

03:03:51.760 --> 03:03:59.360
This gives us our answer for the interval zero to two pi, and we can add multiples of two pi to get all

03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:05.280
other solutions. Or if we want to be more efficient, we can just write the first solution

03:04:07.280 --> 03:04:13.600
plus multiples of pi instead of two pi. Because these two solutions differ by exactly pi,

03:04:15.120 --> 03:04:21.360
taking the first solution and then adding multiples of pi will capture all solutions,

03:04:21.440 --> 03:04:24.240
corresponding to both of these principle solutions.

03:04:26.400 --> 03:04:35.840
To summarize, to find all solutions to cosine t equals m, we need to find first cosine inverse of m,

03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:44.880
then take two pi minus this solution and add multiples of two pi to both of those.

03:04:45.840 --> 03:04:54.480
To find solutions to the equation, sine t equals n, we can start by taking sine inverse of n,

03:04:55.440 --> 03:05:00.480
using pi minus this, and adding multiples of two pi.

03:05:02.640 --> 03:05:11.840
To find all solutions to tangent t equals p, we can take t equal tan inverse of p and

03:05:12.240 --> 03:05:22.160
tan inverse of p plus pi and add multiples of two pi. Or we can just take tan inverse of p

03:05:22.160 --> 03:05:29.680
and add multiples of pi. Although the examples that we saw were more simple than some, because

03:05:29.680 --> 03:05:35.920
for the examples we saw, the inverse trig function always landed us in the first quadrant. These

03:05:36.880 --> 03:05:42.720
methods will work more generally. That's all for this video on solving trig equations that

03:05:42.720 --> 03:05:50.160
require a calculator. This video is about identities involving trig functions, like sine and cosine.

03:05:51.200 --> 03:05:55.040
But I want to start with some examples that just involve quadratic functions.

03:05:56.880 --> 03:06:04.800
If I want to find the solutions to this equation, I can rewrite it x squared minus six x minus seven

03:06:04.800 --> 03:06:14.480
equals zero, factor it x minus seven times x plus one equals zero, set the factors equal to zero,

03:06:15.120 --> 03:06:22.640
x minus seven equals zero, or x plus one equals zero. And that gives me the solutions x equals seven

03:06:23.280 --> 03:06:30.000
or x equals negative one. Next, let's look at this more complicated equation.

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:36.720
I'm going to try to solve that for x by multiplying out the right hand side.

03:06:38.560 --> 03:06:45.760
Next, I'll combine terms on the right hand side. So that gives me x squared minus six x

03:06:46.880 --> 03:06:54.320
on both sides. Well, x squared minus six x is equal to x squared minus six x. That's true no

03:06:54.320 --> 03:07:01.200
matter what I plug in for x. And therefore, all values of x satisfy this equation.

03:07:02.240 --> 03:07:05.280
We can say that the solution set is all real numbers.

03:07:07.920 --> 03:07:12.320
The second equation is called an identity because it holds

03:07:14.240 --> 03:07:21.600
for all values of the variable. The first equation on the other hand is not an identity

03:07:21.600 --> 03:07:25.200
because it only holds for some values of x and not all values.

03:07:26.800 --> 03:07:32.400
Please pause the video for a moment and try to decide which of the following three equations

03:07:32.400 --> 03:07:38.160
are identities, that is, which of these equations hold for all values of the variable.

03:07:39.840 --> 03:07:44.720
To start out, you might want to test them by plugging in a few values of the variable and

03:07:44.800 --> 03:07:52.160
see if the equation holds. The first equation is not an identity.

03:07:53.840 --> 03:08:00.800
It does hold for some values of x. For example, if x equals zero, then sine of two times zero

03:08:01.440 --> 03:08:08.400
is zero, and two times sine of zero is also zero. So it does hold when x is zero.

03:08:09.120 --> 03:08:16.720
However, when x is say pi over two, then sine of two times pi over two, that's the same thing as

03:08:16.720 --> 03:08:25.840
sine of pi, which is zero, but two times sine of pi over two, that's two times one or two.

03:08:26.560 --> 03:08:32.640
And zero is not equal to two. So the equation does not hold for x equals pi over two.

03:08:32.640 --> 03:08:37.760
Since it doesn't hold for all values of the variable, it's not an identity.

03:08:39.440 --> 03:08:47.280
The second equation is an identity. You can build some evidence for this by plugging in numbers,

03:08:47.280 --> 03:08:54.160
for example, cosine of zero plus pi, which is negative one is the same thing as negative of

03:08:54.160 --> 03:09:01.280
cosine of zero. You can also check, for example, that cosine of pi over six plus pi is the same

03:09:01.280 --> 03:09:07.280
thing as negative cosine of pi over six. But even if we check a zillion examples, that's just

03:09:07.280 --> 03:09:11.360
evidence, it's not a proof that the identity holds, we could have just gotten lucky with the

03:09:11.360 --> 03:09:17.840
values we picked. We can build a little bit stronger evidence by looking at graphs.

03:09:19.280 --> 03:09:28.240
I'm going to put theta on the x axis. And if I graph y equals cosine of theta plus pi,

03:09:28.240 --> 03:09:35.040
that's just like the graph of cosine shifted over to the left by pi. On the other hand,

03:09:35.040 --> 03:09:40.960
if I graph y equals negative cosine theta, that's the graph of cosine theta,

03:09:42.240 --> 03:09:47.360
reflected across the x axis, which gives us the exact same graph.

03:09:48.960 --> 03:09:54.160
So graphing both sides gives us strong evidence that this equation is an identity,

03:09:54.160 --> 03:09:59.840
it holds for all values of theta. Now the strongest evidence of all would be an algebraic

03:09:59.840 --> 03:10:05.760
proof, which we'll do later in the course, once we have a formula for the cosine of a sum of two

03:10:05.760 --> 03:10:15.120
angles. In the meantime, let's look at equation C. It turns out equation C is an identity.

03:10:16.400 --> 03:10:20.640
And we could build evidence for it again by plugging in values for x or by graphing the

03:10:20.640 --> 03:10:26.160
left side and the right side separately and checking to see that the graphs coincided.

03:10:26.880 --> 03:10:31.120
But for this example, I'm going to go ahead and do an algebraic verification.

03:10:32.400 --> 03:10:35.440
In particular, I'm going to start with the left side of the equation,

03:10:36.560 --> 03:10:40.800
and rewrite things and rewrite things until I get to the right side of the equation.

03:10:41.920 --> 03:10:47.760
The first thing I'll rewrite is secant and tangent in terms of their constituent functions,

03:10:47.760 --> 03:10:56.000
sine and cosine. Since secant of x is one over cosine x and tangent of x is sine x over cosine x,

03:10:56.000 --> 03:11:06.640
I can rewrite this expression as one over cosine x minus sine x times sine x over cosine x.

03:11:08.800 --> 03:11:16.880
I can clean up those fractions and write this as one over cosine x minus sine squared x

03:11:16.880 --> 03:11:22.880
over cosine x. Now I notice that I have two fractions with the same denominator.

03:11:23.600 --> 03:11:30.240
So I can pull them together as one minus sine squared x over cosine x.

03:11:32.320 --> 03:11:39.360
Next, I'm going to rewrite the numerator one minus sine squared x using the Pythagorean identity

03:11:39.360 --> 03:11:47.120
that says that cosine squared x plus sine squared x equals one. And therefore,

03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:56.800
one minus sine squared x is equal to cosine squared x, just by subtracting sine squared x from both

03:11:56.800 --> 03:12:06.320
sides. So I can replace my numerator one minus sine squared x with cosine squared x

03:12:09.600 --> 03:12:16.160
and canceling one cosine from the top and from the bottom. That's the same thing as cosine of x,

03:12:16.160 --> 03:12:21.920
which is the right hand side that I was trying to get to. So a combination of a bunch of algebra

03:12:22.560 --> 03:12:29.600
and the Pythagorean identity allows me to prove that this equation is true for all values of x,

03:12:29.600 --> 03:12:34.800
it's an identity. The best way to prove that an equation is an identity

03:12:36.080 --> 03:12:43.520
is to use algebra and to use other identities like the Pythagorean identity

03:12:44.640 --> 03:12:49.200
to rewrite one side of the equation till it looks like the other side.

03:12:49.520 --> 03:12:54.720
The best way to prove that an equation is not an identity is to plug in numbers

03:12:55.600 --> 03:13:02.320
that break the identity that is make the equation not true. Now, if you're just trying to decide if

03:13:02.320 --> 03:13:08.320
an equation is an identity or not, and not worried about proving it, then I recommend plugging in

03:13:08.320 --> 03:13:13.440
numbers or graphing the left and right sides to see if those graphs are the same.

03:13:13.440 --> 03:13:21.760
Recall that an identity is an equation that holds for all values of the variable.

03:13:22.880 --> 03:13:27.520
This video states and proves three identities called the Pythagorean identities.

03:13:28.400 --> 03:13:35.760
The first one is the familiar cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one.

03:13:35.760 --> 03:13:43.680
The second one says tan squared theta plus one equals secant squared theta.

03:13:44.480 --> 03:13:51.280
And the third one goes cotangent squared theta plus one equals cosecant squared theta.

03:13:52.720 --> 03:13:57.520
Let's start by proving that cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one.

03:13:58.960 --> 03:14:03.520
I'll do this by drawing the unit circle with the right triangle inside it.

03:14:04.480 --> 03:14:09.600
By the definition of sine and cosine, the x and y coordinates of this top point

03:14:10.320 --> 03:14:18.160
are cosine theta and sine theta. The hypotenuse of my triangle is one, since that's the radius

03:14:18.160 --> 03:14:26.880
of my unit circle. Now, the length of the base of my triangle is the same thing as the x coordinate

03:14:27.680 --> 03:14:37.120
of this point. So that's equal to cosine theta. The height of this triangle is the same thing as

03:14:37.120 --> 03:14:45.680
the y coordinate of this point. So that's sine theta. Now, the Pythagorean theorem for right

03:14:45.680 --> 03:14:51.920
triangles says this side length squared plus that side length squared is equal to the hypotenuse squared.

03:14:52.880 --> 03:15:02.640
So by the Pythagorean theorem, we have that cosine theta squared plus sine theta squared

03:15:02.640 --> 03:15:11.200
equals one squared. I can rewrite that as cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one,

03:15:11.760 --> 03:15:18.320
since one squared is one and cosine squared theta is just a shorthand notation for cosine theta squared.

03:15:18.320 --> 03:15:24.720
That completes the proof of the first Pythagorean identity, at least in the case when the angle

03:15:24.720 --> 03:15:30.400
theta is in the first quadrant. In the case when the angle lies in a different quadrant,

03:15:30.960 --> 03:15:36.800
you can use symmetry to argue the same identity holds. But I won't give the details here.

03:15:37.920 --> 03:15:43.760
To prove the next Pythagorean identity tan squared theta plus one equals secant squared theta,

03:15:43.760 --> 03:15:50.160
let's use the first Pythagorean identity, which said that cosine squared theta plus sine squared

03:15:50.160 --> 03:15:58.320
theta equals one. I'm going to divide both sides of this equation by cosine squared theta.

03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:03.440
Now I'm going to rewrite the left side by breaking apart the fraction

03:16:04.240 --> 03:16:12.080
into cosine squared theta over cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta over cosine squared theta.

03:16:12.320 --> 03:16:19.040
Now cosine squared theta over cosine squared theta is just one. And I can rewrite the next

03:16:19.040 --> 03:16:28.480
fraction as sine of theta over cosine of theta squared. That's because when I square a fraction,

03:16:28.480 --> 03:16:34.080
I can just square the numerator and square the denominator. And sine squared theta is

03:16:34.080 --> 03:16:38.000
shorthand for sine of theta squared, similarly for cosine squared theta.

03:16:38.160 --> 03:16:47.120
Now on the other side of the equal sign, I can rewrite this fraction as one over cosine theta

03:16:47.120 --> 03:16:54.000
squared. Again, that's because when I square the fraction, I just get the one squared, which is one

03:16:54.000 --> 03:17:00.080
divided by the cosine theta squared, which is this. I'm almost done.

03:17:00.880 --> 03:17:04.480
Sine theta over cosine theta is the same thing as tangent theta.

03:17:04.800 --> 03:17:13.920
And one over cosine theta is the same thing as secant theta. Using the shorthand notation,

03:17:14.480 --> 03:17:22.560
this says one plus tan squared theta equals secant squared theta, which after rearranging

03:17:24.160 --> 03:17:29.760
is exactly the identity that we were looking for. The proof of the third

03:17:29.760 --> 03:17:35.920
for that green identity is very similar. Once again, I'll start with the identity cosine

03:17:35.920 --> 03:17:42.560
squared theta plus sine squared theta equals one. And this time I'll divide both sides by sine

03:17:42.560 --> 03:17:50.880
squared theta. I'll break up the fraction on the left. And now I'll rewrite my fractions as cosine

03:17:50.880 --> 03:18:01.840
theta over sine theta squared plus one equals one over sine theta squared. Cosine over sine can be

03:18:01.840 --> 03:18:14.640
written as cotangent. And one over sine can be written as cosecant. That gives me the identity

03:18:14.640 --> 03:18:22.640
that I'm looking for. We've now proved three trig identities. The first one, we proved using the

03:18:22.640 --> 03:18:33.440
unit circle and the Pythagorean theorem. The second and third identities, we proved by using the first

03:18:33.440 --> 03:18:40.960
identity and a bit of algebra. The sum and difference formulas are formulas for computing

03:18:40.960 --> 03:18:49.200
the sine of a sum of two angles, the cosine of a sum of two angles, the sine of a difference of

03:18:49.200 --> 03:18:56.560
two angles, and the cosine of a difference of two angles. Please pause the video for a moment to

03:18:56.560 --> 03:19:04.000
think about this question. Is it true that the sine of a plus b is equal to the sine of a plus the

03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:16.000
sine of b? No, it's not true. And we can see by an example, if we plug in say a equals pi over two

03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:24.240
and b equals pi, then the sine of pi over two plus pi is the same thing as a sine of three pi over

03:19:24.320 --> 03:19:34.240
two, which is negative one, whereas the sine of pi over two plus the sine of pi is equal to one plus

03:19:34.240 --> 03:19:42.240
zero, which is one negative one is not equal to one. So this equation does not hold for all values

03:19:42.240 --> 03:19:49.280
of a and b. There are a few values of a and b for which it does hold. For example, if a is zero and

03:19:49.280 --> 03:19:57.440
b is zero, but it's not true in general. Instead, we need more complicated formulas. It turns out

03:19:57.440 --> 03:20:08.560
that the sine of the sum of two angles a plus b is given by sine of a cosine of b plus cosine of a

03:20:09.280 --> 03:20:20.560
sine of b. The cosine of a plus b is given by cosine a cosine b minus sine a sine b.

03:20:21.760 --> 03:20:29.680
I like to remember these with a song, sine cosine cosine sine cosine cosine minus sine sine.

03:20:31.040 --> 03:20:33.520
Please feel free to back up the video and sing along with me.

03:20:33.760 --> 03:20:39.760
I encourage you to memorize the two formulas for the sine of a sum of angles and the cosine of a

03:20:39.760 --> 03:20:46.000
sum of angles. Once you do, it's easy to figure out the sine and cosine of a difference of two

03:20:46.000 --> 03:20:54.560
angles. One way to do this is to think of sine of a minus b as sine of a plus negative b,

03:20:54.560 --> 03:21:06.800
and then use the angle sum formula. So this works out to sine cosine plus cosine

03:21:08.560 --> 03:21:17.440
sine. And now, if I use the fact that cosine is even, I know that cosine of negative b is cosine of

03:21:17.440 --> 03:21:28.800
b. And since sine is odd, sine of negative b is negative sine of b. So I can rewrite this as

03:21:28.800 --> 03:21:38.160
sine of a cosine of b minus cosine of a sine of b. Notice that this new formula for the difference

03:21:38.160 --> 03:21:43.360
is the same as the formula for the sum is just that plus sign turned into a minus sign.

03:21:43.920 --> 03:21:50.640
We can do the same trick for cosine of a minus b, that's cosine of a plus minus b,

03:21:52.000 --> 03:22:03.040
which is cosine a cosine minus b minus sine of a sine of negative b. Again, using even an odd

03:22:03.120 --> 03:22:14.000
properties, this gives us cosine a cosine b plus sine a sine b. Once again, the formula for the

03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:19.360
difference is almost exactly like the formula for the sum, just that minus sign has switched to a

03:22:19.360 --> 03:22:27.280
plus sign. Now let's use the angle sum formulas to find the exact value for the sine of 105 degrees.

03:22:27.760 --> 03:22:34.480
Now 105 degrees is not a special angle on the unit circle. But I can write it as the sum

03:22:34.480 --> 03:22:44.080
of two special angles, I can write it as 60 degrees plus 45 degrees. Therefore, the sine of 105 degrees

03:22:44.400 --> 03:22:57.760
is the sine of 68 plus 45. And now by the angle sum formula, this is sine, cosine, cosine,

03:22:59.120 --> 03:23:07.600
sine. And I for my unit circle, I can figure out that sine of 60 degrees is root three over two,

03:23:07.680 --> 03:23:15.360
cosine of 45 degrees, root two over two, cosine of 60 degrees is one half, and sine of 45 degrees

03:23:15.360 --> 03:23:23.120
is root two over two. So this simplifies to root six plus root two over four.

03:23:25.440 --> 03:23:32.800
For our last example, let's find the cosine of v plus w, given the values of cosine v and cosine

03:23:32.800 --> 03:23:40.400
w, and the fact that v and w are angles in the first quadrant. Remember, to compute the cosine

03:23:40.400 --> 03:23:45.280
of a sum, we can't just add together the two cosines, that wouldn't even make sense in this case,

03:23:45.280 --> 03:23:48.800
because adding point nine and point seven would give something bigger than one,

03:23:48.800 --> 03:23:54.720
and the cosine of something's never bigger than one. Instead, we have to use the angle sum formula

03:23:54.720 --> 03:24:07.200
for cosine. So that goes cosine of v plus w equals cosine, cosine, minus sine, sine. Now,

03:24:07.200 --> 03:24:12.320
I'm already know the cosine of v and the cosine of w, so I could just plug those in. But I have

03:24:12.320 --> 03:24:18.800
to figure out the sine of v and the sine of w from the given information. And one way to do that is

03:24:18.880 --> 03:24:24.720
to draw right triangles. So here I'm going to draw a right triangle with angle v,

03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:29.280
and another right triangle with angle w.

03:24:31.600 --> 03:24:39.360
Since I know that the cosine of v is point nine, I can think of that as nine over 10,

03:24:39.360 --> 03:24:45.120
and I can think of that as adjacent over hypotenuse in my right triangle. So I'll

03:24:45.120 --> 03:24:49.680
decorate my triangles adjacent side with the number nine and the hypotenuse with 10.

03:24:50.960 --> 03:24:56.080
Similarly, since I know that the cosine of w is point seven, which is seven tenths,

03:24:56.080 --> 03:25:00.480
I can put a seven on this adjacent side, and a 10 on this hypotenuse.

03:25:02.560 --> 03:25:06.640
Now the Pythagorean theorem, let's me compute the length of the unlabeled side.

03:25:07.760 --> 03:25:12.000
So this one is going to be the square root of 10 squared minus nine squared,

03:25:12.720 --> 03:25:18.640
that's going to be the square root of 19. And here I have the square root of 10 squared minus

03:25:18.640 --> 03:25:27.280
seven squared. So that's the square root of 51. I can now find the sine of v as the opposite

03:25:27.280 --> 03:25:33.120
over the hypotenuse. So that's the square root of 19 over 10. And the sine of w

03:25:34.160 --> 03:25:41.520
will be the square root of 51 over 10. Because we're assuming v and w are in the first quadrant,

03:25:42.000 --> 03:25:47.360
we know the values of sine need to be positive. So we don't need to jimmy around with positive

03:25:47.360 --> 03:25:53.760
or negative signs in our answers, we can just leave them as is. Now we're ready to plug into our

03:25:53.760 --> 03:26:04.640
formula. So we have that cosine of v plus w is equal to point nine times point seven minus the

03:26:04.640 --> 03:26:12.960
square root of 19 over 10 times the square root of 51 over 10. Using a calculator, this works out

03:26:12.960 --> 03:26:22.720
to a decimal approximation of 0.3187. This video gave the angle sum and difference formulas

03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:29.920
and use them to compute some values. To see a proof for why the sum formulas hold,

03:26:30.640 --> 03:26:37.840
please watch my other video. Remember the angle sum formulas? Those are the formulas for computing

03:26:37.840 --> 03:26:50.000
sine of a plus b and cosine of a plus b. I like to sing them sine cosine cosine sine

03:26:51.760 --> 03:27:03.360
cosine cosine minus sine sine. This video gives a geometric proof of those formulas.

03:27:04.320 --> 03:27:08.320
There are many great proofs of the angle sum formulas, but I'd like to share with you one of my

03:27:08.320 --> 03:27:14.080
favorites for those who are interested. I'll write the angle sum formulas up here. So we'll

03:27:14.080 --> 03:27:20.480
know what we're trying to prove. To prove these formulas, let me start by drawing an angle a

03:27:23.280 --> 03:27:25.440
and an angle b on top of that.

03:27:26.320 --> 03:27:33.120
Next, I'm going to draw a line perpendicular to this middle line. And I'm going to extend the top

03:27:33.120 --> 03:27:40.960
line until it meets that perpendicular, making a right triangle. Finally, I'll draw a rectangle

03:27:40.960 --> 03:27:48.240
around that right triangle that just touches its vertices. My rectangle is now divided up into

03:27:48.240 --> 03:27:53.360
four right triangles. And I'm going to choose units of measurement so that the hypotenuse

03:27:53.440 --> 03:28:00.080
of my middle triangle has length one. Now let's stop for a minute to think about the angles of

03:28:00.080 --> 03:28:07.200
these other triangles. Since the top and the bottom edge of the rectangle are parallel lines,

03:28:08.480 --> 03:28:17.440
and this hypotenuse is a transversal, this angle up here must have the same measure as a plus b

03:28:17.840 --> 03:28:26.160
down here. Also, this skinny angle here must have the same measure as a down here.

03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:37.680
Because this angle is 180 degrees minus 90 degrees minus this angle here. And this angle a is also

03:28:37.680 --> 03:28:44.640
180 degrees, the measure of the angles in the triangle minus 90 degrees minus that same angle.

03:28:44.640 --> 03:28:52.480
So I'll label this skinny angle with a. Next, let's figure out as many side lengths as we can.

03:28:53.520 --> 03:28:59.760
Based on the middle right triangle with hypotenuse one, we know that this side length down here

03:28:59.760 --> 03:29:07.200
must be cosine of b. Since adjacent over hypotenuse is cosine b. Similarly, this side length here

03:29:07.200 --> 03:29:25.760
must be sine of b. Since opposite over hypotenuse is sine of b. Now we see that sine of b is the

03:29:26.320 --> 03:29:36.800
of this right triangle, which means that this little side here has measure sine a times sine b.

03:29:39.440 --> 03:29:45.520
That's because the opposite over the hypotenuse of this angle has to equal sine a.

03:29:47.040 --> 03:29:52.880
A similar argument shows that this side has to have measure cosine a times sine b.

03:29:53.440 --> 03:29:58.400
Please pause the video and take a moment to fill in the side lengths of this right triangle

03:29:59.680 --> 03:30:11.840
and this right triangle. You should be getting sine a cosine b cosine a cosine b

03:30:12.800 --> 03:30:15.680
sine of a plus b

03:30:18.480 --> 03:30:20.320
and cosine of a plus b.

03:30:25.200 --> 03:30:30.400
But remember, we have a rectangle here. So the opposite sides have equal lengths.

03:30:31.120 --> 03:30:40.000
This tells us that sine of a plus b has to equal sine of a cosine of b plus cosine of a sine of b,

03:30:40.000 --> 03:30:48.720
which is exactly the first angle sum formula. Also, cosine of a plus b, which is this side length,

03:30:48.720 --> 03:30:56.720
is exactly the difference of this side length cosine a cosine b minus this side length sine of a

03:30:56.720 --> 03:31:04.080
sine b. And that's the second angle sum formula. So I think that's a pretty great geometric proof

03:31:04.080 --> 03:31:13.760
of the angle sum formulas. This video gives formulas for sine of two theta and cosine of two theta.

03:31:14.960 --> 03:31:20.640
Please pause the video for a moment and see if you think this equation sine of two theta equals

03:31:20.720 --> 03:31:28.720
sine theta is true or false. Remember that true means always true for all values of theta,

03:31:28.720 --> 03:31:31.200
where false means sometimes are always false.

03:31:33.680 --> 03:31:38.080
This equation is false because it's not true for all values of theta.

03:31:38.880 --> 03:31:44.960
One way to see this is graphically. If I graph y equals sine of two theta,

03:31:45.520 --> 03:31:53.360
that's like the graph of sine theta squished in horizontally by a factor of one half.

03:31:54.640 --> 03:32:01.680
On the other hand, if I graph y equals to sine theta, that's like the graph of sine theta

03:32:01.680 --> 03:32:06.960
stretched vertically by a factor of two. These two graphs are not the same.

03:32:08.240 --> 03:32:12.560
So instead, we need a more complicated formula for sine of two theta.

03:32:13.280 --> 03:32:20.880
And that formula is sine of two theta is two sine theta cosine theta.

03:32:22.000 --> 03:32:26.480
It's not hard to see why that formula works based on the angle sum formula.

03:32:27.440 --> 03:32:37.280
Recall that sine of a plus b is equal to sine a cosine b plus cosine a sine b.

03:32:37.760 --> 03:32:46.960
Sine b. Therefore, sine of two theta, which is sine of theta plus theta is going to be sine theta

03:32:47.520 --> 03:32:55.360
cosine theta plus cosine theta sine theta, simply plugging in theta for a and theta for b

03:32:56.160 --> 03:33:03.600
in this angle sum formula. Well, sine theta cosine theta is the same thing as cosine theta sine theta.

03:33:03.600 --> 03:33:13.120
So I can rewrite this as twice sine theta cosine theta. That gives me this formula.

03:33:15.200 --> 03:33:23.040
There's also a formula for cosine of two theta. And that formula is cosine squared theta minus

03:33:23.040 --> 03:33:30.720
sine squared theta. Again, we can use the angle sum formula to see where this comes from.

03:33:31.680 --> 03:33:41.600
Cosine of a plus b is equal to cosine of a cosine of b minus sine a sine b. So if we want cosine

03:33:41.600 --> 03:33:49.200
of two theta, that's just cosine of theta plus theta, which is cosine theta cosine theta minus

03:33:49.200 --> 03:33:54.880
sine theta sine theta by plugging in theta for a and b.

03:33:55.760 --> 03:34:01.760
This can be rewritten as cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta, which is exactly the formula

03:34:01.760 --> 03:34:08.960
above. Now there are a couple other formulas for cosine of two theta that are also popular. One

03:34:08.960 --> 03:34:18.080
of them is one minus two sine squared theta. And the other one is cosine of two theta is two

03:34:18.160 --> 03:34:28.880
cosine squared theta minus one. You can get each of these two formulas from the original one

03:34:29.600 --> 03:34:36.000
using the Pythagorean identity. We know that cosine squared theta plus sine squared theta

03:34:36.000 --> 03:34:44.000
is one. So cosine squared theta is one minus sine squared theta. If I plug that into my original

03:34:44.000 --> 03:34:52.640
formula, which I've copied here, so I'm plugging in instead of cosine squared, I'm going to write

03:34:52.640 --> 03:34:58.880
one minus sine squared theta, I still have another minus sine squared theta. So that's the same thing

03:34:58.880 --> 03:35:06.720
as one minus twice sine squared theta, which is exactly what I'm looking for. Similarly,

03:35:07.520 --> 03:35:14.400
I can use the Pythagorean identity to write sine squared theta as one minus cosine squared theta.

03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:23.680
Again, I'll take this equation and copy it below. But this time I'm going to plug in for sine

03:35:23.680 --> 03:35:31.520
squared right here. So that gives me cosine of two theta is cosine squared theta minus the quantity

03:35:32.080 --> 03:35:40.400
one minus cosine squared theta. That simplifies to two cosine squared theta minus one after

03:35:40.400 --> 03:35:47.280
distributing the negative sign and combining like terms. So I have one double angle formula

03:35:47.280 --> 03:35:52.000
for sine of two theta, and I have three versions of the double angle formula for cosine of two

03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:59.360
theta. Now let's use these formulas in some examples. Let's find the cosine of two theta

03:35:59.360 --> 03:36:05.680
if we know that cosine theta is negative one over root 10, and theta terminates in quadrant three.

03:36:06.880 --> 03:36:13.760
We have a choice of three formulas for cosine of two theta. I'm going to choose the second one,

03:36:13.760 --> 03:36:19.200
because it only involves cosine of theta on the right side. And I already know my value for cosine

03:36:19.200 --> 03:36:25.120
theta. Of course, I could use one of the other ones, but then I'd have to work out the value of

03:36:25.120 --> 03:36:33.280
sine theta. So plugging in, I get cosine of two theta is twice negative one over root 10

03:36:33.280 --> 03:36:42.000
squared minus one, which simplifies to two tenths minus one or negative eight tenths, negative

03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:49.600
four fifths. Finally, let's solve the equation to cosine x plus sine of two x equals zero.

03:36:49.600 --> 03:36:56.240
What makes this equation tricky is that one of the trig functions has the argument of just x,

03:36:56.240 --> 03:37:01.360
but the other trig function has the argument of two x. So I want to use my double angle formula

03:37:01.360 --> 03:37:10.400
to rewrite sine of two x. I'll copy down the two cosine x, and now sine of two x is equal to two

03:37:11.120 --> 03:37:21.040
sine x cosine x. At this point, I see a way to factor my equation, I can factor out a two cosine

03:37:21.040 --> 03:37:32.800
x from both of these two terms. That gives me one plus sine x, and the product there is equal to

03:37:32.800 --> 03:37:41.200
zero. That means that either two cosine x is equal to zero, or one plus sine x is equal to zero.

03:37:42.080 --> 03:37:49.440
That simplifies to cosine x equals zero, or sine x is negative one. Using my unit circle,

03:37:49.440 --> 03:38:00.800
I see that cosine of x is zero at pi over two, and three pi over two, while sine of x is negative

03:38:00.800 --> 03:38:10.240
one at three pi over two. There's some redundancy here, but my solution set is going to be pi over

03:38:10.240 --> 03:38:19.920
two plus multiples of two pi, and three pi over two plus multiples of two pi. This video proved

03:38:19.920 --> 03:38:26.800
the double angle formulas sine of two theta is two sine theta cosine theta. And cosine of two

03:38:26.800 --> 03:38:34.560
theta is cosine squared theta minus sine squared theta. It also proved two alternate versions

03:38:35.520 --> 03:38:43.440
of the equation for cosine of two theta. This video is about the half angle formulas for computing

03:38:43.440 --> 03:38:53.840
cosine of theta over two, and sine of theta over two. Cosine of theta over two is either plus or minus

03:38:53.840 --> 03:39:03.120
the square root of one plus cosine theta all over two. To figure out whether to use plus or minus,

03:39:03.280 --> 03:39:09.040
you need to know something about what quadrant the angle theta over two is. If you're expecting

03:39:09.040 --> 03:39:13.920
cosine theta over two to be negative, then you're going to need the negative sign. You're expecting

03:39:13.920 --> 03:39:18.080
this cosine to be positive. Then of course you want the positive sign since the square root of

03:39:18.080 --> 03:39:24.240
something is always positive. Notice that this formula always makes sense, because the inside

03:39:24.240 --> 03:39:29.680
of the square root sign is always going to be positive or zero, since cosine theta can't be

03:39:29.680 --> 03:39:36.400
any more negative than negative one. We have a similar formula for sine of theta over two. And

03:39:36.400 --> 03:39:45.280
that's plus or minus the square root of one minus cosine theta over two. Notice that the formulas for

03:39:45.280 --> 03:39:51.680
both cosine of a half angle and sine of a half angle, both have cosine in them, they just differ

03:39:51.680 --> 03:39:59.040
by the positive or negative sign in the inside of the square root. To see why these formulas hold,

03:39:59.040 --> 03:40:07.440
let's recall the formulas for double angles. We know that cosine of two x is equal to two

03:40:07.440 --> 03:40:17.280
cosine squared x minus one, or we can write cosine of two x as one minus two sine squared of x. Of

03:40:17.280 --> 03:40:25.200
course, we can also write cosine of two x as cosine squared x minus sine squared x, but this one

03:40:25.200 --> 03:40:31.840
won't be relevant to our discussion right now. So I'm going to start with this first formula.

03:40:32.560 --> 03:40:39.520
And I'm going to make the substitution theta equals two x. That allows me to write cosine theta

03:40:40.080 --> 03:40:49.280
is two cosine squared theta over two minus one, since if theta is two x, then x is theta over two.

03:40:49.520 --> 03:40:59.040
So now I'm going to solve for cosine of theta over two. So I'll add one to both sides,

03:41:02.480 --> 03:41:04.000
divide both sides by two,

03:41:08.800 --> 03:41:14.880
and take the square root of both sides. That gives me that cosine of theta over two is going to be

03:41:14.880 --> 03:41:20.720
plus or minus the square root of cosine theta plus one over two, which is the formula we're looking

03:41:20.720 --> 03:41:29.280
for. I can carry a similar process out with the second formula. I'll substitute theta for two x,

03:41:29.280 --> 03:41:36.800
which means that x is theta over two, that gives me cosine theta is one minus two sine squared theta

03:41:36.800 --> 03:41:47.200
over two. Now I'll solve for sine of theta over two. I'll start by adding two sine squared theta

03:41:47.200 --> 03:41:56.400
over two to both sides. Next, I'll subtract cosine theta from both sides. Next, I'll divide both sides

03:41:56.400 --> 03:42:05.200
by two. And finally, I'll take the square root of both sides. That gives me sine of theta over two

03:42:05.200 --> 03:42:11.680
is plus or minus the square root of one minus cosine theta over two, which is the formula I was

03:42:11.680 --> 03:42:18.240
looking for. Now that we've got our formulas, and know where they come from, let's use them in an

03:42:18.240 --> 03:42:24.720
example. Let's suppose that sine theta is four fifths, and theta is between pi over two and pi.

03:42:25.920 --> 03:42:33.440
That means it's in the second quadrant. We want to find the exact values of cosine theta over two

03:42:33.440 --> 03:42:41.120
and sine theta over two. Since theta is between pi over two and pi, theta over two will be between

03:42:41.120 --> 03:42:51.200
pi over four and pi over two. So theta over two is somewhere in the first quadrant. That means

03:42:51.200 --> 03:42:58.240
that cosine theta over two and sine theta over two will both be positive. Let me write down my

03:42:58.240 --> 03:43:04.240
half angle formulas. And I know I could ignore the negative version and just use the positive

03:43:04.240 --> 03:43:09.360
version. Now, unfortunately, I'm just given the value of sine theta, not cosine theta. So I can't

03:43:09.360 --> 03:43:15.840
plug in directly. First, I have to use this value to figure out what cosine might be. I'll draw a

03:43:15.840 --> 03:43:23.760
right triangle with angle theta. And since sine of theta is four fifths, I'll decorate the triangle

03:43:23.760 --> 03:43:30.480
with a four and a five on the hypotenuse. That means that this side length is going to be five

03:43:30.480 --> 03:43:36.160
squared, square root of five squared minus four squared, which is the square root of nine, which

03:43:36.160 --> 03:43:46.320
is three. That means that cosine theta is going to be either plus or minus three fifths, because

03:43:46.320 --> 03:43:53.760
it's adjacent over hypotenuse. Now, since I'm in the angle, the second quadrant for my angle theta,

03:43:54.320 --> 03:44:00.960
cosine is actually going to be negative three fifths. Now I can plug into my formulas.

03:44:01.840 --> 03:44:08.080
I get that cosine of theta over two is going to be the square root of one minus three fifths

03:44:08.080 --> 03:44:14.880
over two. That simplifies to the square root of two fifths divided by two, which is the square

03:44:14.880 --> 03:44:23.360
root of one fifth, or one over the square to five. sine of theta over two is the square root of one

03:44:23.360 --> 03:44:31.760
minus cosine theta. So that's one minus negative three fifths over two. That's the square root of

03:44:32.960 --> 03:44:39.440
one plus three fifths, or eight fifths over two, the square root of four fifths, or two over the

03:44:39.520 --> 03:44:46.720
square root of five. In this video, we found formulas for the cosine of a half angle, and the

03:44:46.720 --> 03:44:54.720
sine of a half angle, and use them in an example. Solving a right triangle means finding the lengths

03:44:54.720 --> 03:45:02.960
of all the sides, and the measures of the angles, given partial information. In this example,

03:45:03.520 --> 03:45:09.520
we're given the length of one side, and the measure of one angle, plus we know the measure

03:45:09.520 --> 03:45:16.160
of this right angle is 90 degrees. We need to find the measure of the third angle, labeled

03:45:16.160 --> 03:45:23.760
capital A, and the lengths of the two sides labeled lowercase b and lowercase c. To find the measure

03:45:23.760 --> 03:45:30.480
of angle a, let's use the fact that the measures of the three angles of a triangle add up to 180

03:45:30.480 --> 03:45:42.240
degrees. So that means that 49 degrees plus 90 degrees plus a is equal to 180 degrees. So a is

03:45:42.240 --> 03:45:50.000
equal to 180 degrees minus 90 degrees minus 49 degrees, which works out to 41 degrees.

03:45:51.680 --> 03:45:55.120
To find the length of the side B, we have a couple possible options.

03:45:55.280 --> 03:46:04.400
We could use the fact that tan of 49 degrees, which is opposite over adjacent, is B over 23.

03:46:04.400 --> 03:46:17.840
So B is 23 times tan 49 degrees, which works out to 26.46 units. Alternatively, we could use the fact

03:46:17.840 --> 03:46:26.080
we could use the fact that tan of 41 degrees is 23 over B. Since now, if we're looking at the

03:46:26.080 --> 03:46:32.400
angle here, 23 is our opposite and B is in our adjacent. That's a little bit harder to solve

03:46:32.400 --> 03:46:42.960
algebraically. But we can write B tan 41 degrees equals 23, which means that B is 23 divided by

03:46:42.960 --> 03:46:51.360
tan 41 degrees with a calculator that works out again to 26.46. The reason we want to use tan in

03:46:51.360 --> 03:46:59.520
this problem and not say sine or cosine is because tan of say 49 degrees relates and the unknown side

03:46:59.520 --> 03:47:05.760
that we're looking for B to the side that we know the measure of. If we had used sine instead, we'd

03:47:05.760 --> 03:47:12.320
be saying that sine of 49 is B over C, and we'd have two unknowns, which would make it difficult to

03:47:12.320 --> 03:47:21.520
solve. Next, to find the side length C, we can have a few options. We could use a trig function

03:47:21.520 --> 03:47:30.240
again. For example, we could use the cosine of 49 degrees. That's adjacent over hypotenuse,

03:47:30.960 --> 03:47:47.360
which is 23 over C. Solving for C, we get that C is 23 over cosine 49, which works out to 35.06 units.

03:47:49.120 --> 03:47:54.800
Another option would be to use the Pythagorean theorem to find C. Since we know 23 squared

03:47:55.760 --> 03:48:03.360
plus B squared equals C squared, in other words, that's 23 squared plus 26.46 squared

03:48:03.360 --> 03:48:12.880
equals C squared, which means that C is the square root of that sum, which works out again

03:48:12.880 --> 03:48:20.640
to 35.06. To review, the ideas we used were the sum of the angles

03:48:20.880 --> 03:48:30.400
is equal to 180 degrees. We used facts like tangent of an angle being opposite over adjacent,

03:48:30.400 --> 03:48:35.440
and similar facts about sine and cosine. And we use the Pythagorean theorem.

03:48:36.400 --> 03:48:41.120
This allowed us to find all the angles and side lengths of the triangle, knowing just

03:48:41.120 --> 03:48:47.600
the side length of one side and the angle of one of the non right angles to begin with.

03:48:47.840 --> 03:48:53.680
In this next example, we don't know any of the angles, except for the right angle. But we know

03:48:53.680 --> 03:49:01.360
two of the side lengths. To find the unknown angle theta, we can use the fact that cosine theta

03:49:01.360 --> 03:49:09.520
is adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's 10 over 15. Cosine is a good trig function to use here,

03:49:09.520 --> 03:49:16.480
because this equation relates our unknown angle to our two known sides. So we just have

03:49:16.480 --> 03:49:23.200
one unknown in our equation to solve for. To solve for theta, we just take the cosine inverse

03:49:23.200 --> 03:49:38.880
of 10 15ths, which is 0.8411 radians, or 48.19 degrees. To find the measure of angle fee,

03:49:38.880 --> 03:49:45.360
we could use the fact that sine of fee is 10 over 15, and take sine inverse of 10 15ths,

03:49:46.320 --> 03:49:50.800
but probably a little easier as just to use the fact that these three angles add to 180 degrees.

03:49:52.080 --> 03:50:01.600
That tells us that fee plus 90 plus 48.19 is equal to 180, which means that fee

03:50:03.760 --> 03:50:14.560
is 41.81. Finally, we can find x either using a trig function, or by using the Pythagorean theorem.

03:50:16.160 --> 03:50:23.360
To find it using a trig function, we could write down something like tan of 48.19 degrees

03:50:23.360 --> 03:50:30.240
is x over 10. To find it using Pythagorean theorem, we'd write down 10 squared plus x squared equals

03:50:30.240 --> 03:50:37.360
15 squared. I'll use a Pythagorean theorem and find that x by doing the square root of 15 squared

03:50:37.360 --> 03:50:46.640
minus 10 squared. That gives me an answer of 11.18. Notice that we use many of the same ideas as in

03:50:46.640 --> 03:50:54.320
the previous problem. For example, the fact that the sum of the angles is 180, the Pythagorean theorem,

03:50:55.280 --> 03:51:02.240
and the trig functions like tan, sine and cosine. We also use the inverse trig functions

03:51:03.200 --> 03:51:06.480
to get from an equation like this one to the angle.

03:51:08.240 --> 03:51:12.480
This video showed how it's possible to find the lengths of all the sides of a right triangle

03:51:12.480 --> 03:51:19.280
and the measures of all the angles given partial information. For example, the measure of one angle

03:51:19.280 --> 03:51:22.720
and one side, or from two sides.

03:51:25.440 --> 03:51:31.920
Recall that solving a triangle means finding all the lengths of the sides and all the measures of

03:51:31.920 --> 03:51:39.040
the angles from partial information. The law of cosines is a tool that can help us solve triangles

03:51:39.040 --> 03:51:45.920
that are not necessarily right triangles. Recall that the Pythagorean theorem says that for our

03:51:45.920 --> 03:51:53.760
right triangle, like this one, the length of the hypotenuse is related to the lengths of the sides

03:51:53.760 --> 03:52:01.600
by the formula c squared equals a squared plus b squared. I like to think of the law of cosines

03:52:01.600 --> 03:52:07.120
as a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to triangles that are not necessarily right triangles.

03:52:08.480 --> 03:52:15.440
Loosely speaking, the law of cosines says that c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared

03:52:15.440 --> 03:52:23.360
plus a correction factor, where the correction factor depends on the size of the angle that's

03:52:23.360 --> 03:52:33.120
opposite to side c. For this first triangle, on the left, the angle that's opposite to side c

03:52:33.120 --> 03:52:40.400
is exactly a right angle. So we know that c squared is exactly equal to a squared plus b squared.

03:52:42.080 --> 03:52:49.280
But in this next triangle, the angle opposite to side c prime is a little bit less than a right

03:52:49.280 --> 03:52:56.880
angle. So we expect the side length c prime should be a little bit shorter than the side length c

03:52:56.880 --> 03:53:04.560
in the previous triangle that had the same side lengths a and b for its legs. Therefore, c prime

03:53:04.560 --> 03:53:11.120
squared should be less than a squared plus b squared. Or in other words, c prime squared

03:53:11.120 --> 03:53:18.640
should equal a squared plus b squared minus a little bit. In this third triangle, the angle

03:53:18.640 --> 03:53:25.360
opposite c double prime is a little bigger than 90 degrees. So this side length c double prime

03:53:25.360 --> 03:53:31.520
should be a little bit longer than the side length c in the right triangle with the same size legs.

03:53:33.200 --> 03:53:40.400
So c double prime squared should be bigger than a squared plus b squared. We can write this as c

03:53:40.400 --> 03:53:47.680
double prime squared is equal to a squared plus b squared plus a little bit. The law of cosines

03:53:47.680 --> 03:53:54.240
says precisely what this little correction factor is. It says that for any triangle with sides a,

03:53:54.240 --> 03:54:05.120
b, and c, an angle capital C opposite side c side c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared

03:54:05.120 --> 03:54:12.400
minus two a, b cosine angle C. Let's analyze what happens in this equation

03:54:13.200 --> 03:54:18.400
when angle C is equal to 90 degrees less than 90 degrees and greater than 90 degrees.

03:54:20.720 --> 03:54:30.000
If angle C is equal to 90 degrees, then cosine of angle C is equal to zero. So we have that c

03:54:30.000 --> 03:54:35.760
squared is equal to a squared plus b squared, the ordinary Pythagorean theorem. If on the other

03:54:35.760 --> 03:54:43.280
hand, angle C is less than 90 degrees, then from the unit circle, we know that cosine of c is positive.

03:54:44.240 --> 03:54:53.200
So to a b cosine C is a positive number, and we'll be subtracting a little bit from our a squared

03:54:53.200 --> 03:55:01.200
plus b squared, just like we saw in the picture. Finally, if angle C is bigger than 90 degrees,

03:55:01.200 --> 03:55:08.640
then we can see from the unit circle that cosine of c is negative. So two a, b cosine

03:55:09.360 --> 03:55:15.280
capital C is going to be less than zero. And we're going to be subtracting a negative number,

03:55:15.280 --> 03:55:19.520
which means we're actually adding a little bit, just like we saw in the third picture.

03:55:19.920 --> 03:55:26.320
When labeling a triangle, the convention is to use capital letters for the angles and lowercase

03:55:26.320 --> 03:55:33.600
letters for the side lengths, and to put side a opposite angle a and so on. When we wrote the law

03:55:33.600 --> 03:55:42.000
of cosines on the previous page, we wrote c squared equals a squared plus b squared minus two a b

03:55:42.480 --> 03:55:50.560
cosine angle C. But it doesn't matter which side we call a, which side we call b, and which side

03:55:50.560 --> 03:55:57.280
we call C, all that matters is that this angle is opposite to this side, and between these two sides.

03:55:58.720 --> 03:56:05.120
So we could have just as easily written a squared is equal to b squared plus c squared

03:56:05.200 --> 03:56:14.400
minus two b c cosine a. All we've done is replace C with a, a with b,

03:56:15.680 --> 03:56:23.600
and b with C in our labeling scheme. Or instead, we could put the b squared on the left side and

03:56:23.600 --> 03:56:32.400
write b squared equals a squared plus c squared minus two ac cosine b. We can use whichever of these

03:56:32.480 --> 03:56:38.960
three forms is most convenient for the problem at hand. Let's use the law of cosines to find all

03:56:38.960 --> 03:56:45.840
the side lengths and angles in this triangle. By convention, I'll call the side opposite to angle

03:56:45.840 --> 03:56:58.240
a little a and the side opposite angle b little b. Notice that we know two side lengths and the

03:56:58.240 --> 03:57:08.560
angle between them. So that's an s a s side angle side triangle. If we write down the law of cosines

03:57:08.560 --> 03:57:16.000
with the unknown side, c squared on the left side, then we have all the values for the variables on

03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:23.680
the right side. So let's plug them in. I'll use a calculator in degree mode to find that c squared

03:57:23.680 --> 03:57:35.360
is equal to 44.44. Taking the square root, I get that C is equal to 6.67. Next, I'll use the law

03:57:35.360 --> 03:57:42.960
of cosines to find the angle b. I'll need to use a version of the law of cosines that has cosine b

03:57:42.960 --> 03:57:50.880
right here. That's the version that has little b squared on the left side. And goes b squared

03:57:50.880 --> 03:58:00.000
equals a squared plus c squared minus two ac cosine b. I can plug in values for all my side

03:58:00.000 --> 03:58:09.840
lengths. And now I can solve for cosine b. To do that, I'll subtract eight squared and 6.67 squared

03:58:09.840 --> 03:58:18.400
from both sides. And now I'll divide both sides by negative two times eight times 6.67. Using a

03:58:18.400 --> 03:58:27.840
calculator, this gives me that cosine of b is equal to negative 0.1172. The negative value of

03:58:27.840 --> 03:58:37.120
cosine indicates that my angle b must be greater than 90 degrees, which agrees with a figure. Next,

03:58:37.120 --> 03:58:46.720
I can take cosine inverse of both sides to get that b is equal to cosine inverse negative 0.1172,

03:58:46.720 --> 03:58:55.840
which works out to 96.73 degrees. The last thing I need to do is solve for angle a. I could use the

03:58:55.840 --> 03:59:02.720
law of cosines again, and work out angle a just like I worked out angle b here. But a simpler

03:59:02.720 --> 03:59:09.280
thing to do is to use the fact that the sum of the three angles equals 180 degrees. In other words,

03:59:09.840 --> 03:59:22.000
a plus 37 degrees plus 96.73 degrees equals 180 degrees. So a is going to be 180 minus 37 minus

03:59:22.000 --> 03:59:34.560
96.73, which works out to 46.27 degrees. In the previous example, we were given two sides and the

03:59:34.560 --> 03:59:42.800
angle between them. In this example, instead, we're given three side lengths. So I'll call this an s s s

03:59:42.800 --> 03:59:51.040
side side side triangle. We need to find all three angles. Although there are a lot of computations

03:59:51.040 --> 03:59:58.720
involved, the ideas are the same as in the previous problem. To find angle capital C, we need the form

03:59:58.720 --> 04:00:05.920
of the law of cosines that has cosine of c on the right side, and little c on the left side,

04:00:06.960 --> 04:00:14.480
to find angle a, we need the form of the law of cosines that has cosine a on the right side and

04:00:14.480 --> 04:00:21.360
little a on the left side. And to find angle d, we need the form of the law of cosines that has

04:00:21.360 --> 04:00:29.520
cosine of b on the right side, and little b squared on the left side. For each of

04:00:29.520 --> 04:00:35.520
these three equations, I'll plug in the side lengths, solve for the cosines, and

04:00:35.520 --> 04:00:42.880
use inverse cosine to find my angles. Notice that my three angles, 60 degrees,

04:00:43.280 --> 04:00:53.520
32.20 degrees, and 87.79 degrees add up to just almost 180 degrees. The difference is just due

04:00:53.520 --> 04:00:59.600
to a round off error. In fact, I could have saved myself some work by just finding the

04:00:59.600 --> 04:01:05.600
measure of angle C, and the measure of angle A, and then subtracting them from 180 degrees

04:01:05.600 --> 04:01:11.200
to get the measure of angle B. In this video, we stated the law of cosines,

04:01:12.160 --> 04:01:17.680
and used it to solve some triangles. The law of cosines can be thought of as the

04:01:17.680 --> 04:01:23.440
Pythagorean theorem with a correction factor to account for triangles that aren't right triangles.

04:01:25.440 --> 04:01:30.320
Recall that solving a right triangle means finding all the lengths of the sides and all

04:01:30.320 --> 04:01:36.240
the measures of the angles from partial information. The law of cosines is a tool that can help us

04:01:36.240 --> 04:01:42.720
solve triangles that are not necessarily right triangles. Recall that the Pythagorean theorem

04:01:42.720 --> 04:01:52.160
says that for a right triangle, like this one, C squared is equal to A squared plus B squared.

04:01:53.920 --> 04:01:58.560
I like to think of the law of cosines as a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem

04:01:58.560 --> 04:02:01.440
to triangles that are not necessarily right triangles.

04:02:02.400 --> 04:02:09.680
Loosely speaking, the law of cosines says that C squared is equal to A squared plus B squared

04:02:09.680 --> 04:02:16.720
plus a correction factor, where the correction factor depends on the size of the angle that's

04:02:16.720 --> 04:02:24.800
opposite size C. In this first triangle on the left, the angle opposite to side C is a right

04:02:24.800 --> 04:02:31.760
angle. So we know that C squared is equal to exactly A squared plus B squared.

04:02:33.360 --> 04:02:40.640
But in the next triangle, the angle opposite to side C prime is a little bit less than a

04:02:40.640 --> 04:02:47.920
right angle. So this side C prime should be a little shorter than A squared plus B squared.

04:02:48.880 --> 04:02:56.160
I'll write C prime squared is equal to A squared plus B squared minus a bit.

04:02:59.280 --> 04:03:06.000
In this third triangle, since the angle opposite to side C double prime is a little bit bigger

04:03:06.000 --> 04:03:11.440
than 90 degrees, this side length should be a little bit bigger than A squared plus B squared.

04:03:12.080 --> 04:03:15.680
So I'll write it as A squared plus B squared plus a little bit.

04:03:17.040 --> 04:03:23.120
The law of cosines says exactly what this little correction factor is. It says that for any triangle

04:03:23.120 --> 04:03:31.680
with sides A, B, and C, an angle capital C opposite to side C, C squared is equal to A squared plus B

04:03:31.680 --> 04:03:41.520
squared minus two AB cosine of angle C. Notice that if the angle C is less than 90 degrees,

04:03:42.400 --> 04:03:45.520
cosine of C is going to be a positive number.

04:03:48.160 --> 04:03:54.960
And so we'll be subtracting a positive quantity, just like we saw in the picture above.

04:03:55.920 --> 04:04:04.080
If, however, angle C is bigger than 90 degrees, then cosine of C is negative. So by subtracting

04:04:04.880 --> 04:04:11.200
to AB cosine C, we're actually adding a little bit, and we get a longer side, as in this picture.

04:04:13.120 --> 04:04:18.560
When labeling a triangle, the convention is to use lowercase letters for the side lengths

04:04:18.560 --> 04:04:24.080
and uppercase letters for the angles, and to put angle A opposite side A and so on.

04:04:25.440 --> 04:04:31.680
When we wrote the law of cosines on the previous page, we wrote C squared equals A squared plus

04:04:31.680 --> 04:04:41.040
B squared minus two AB cosine C. But it doesn't matter which side we call A, which side we call

04:04:41.040 --> 04:04:47.680
B, and which side we call C. All that matters is that this angle is opposite to this side

04:04:47.680 --> 04:04:55.040
and between these two sides. So we could have just as easily written A squared equals

04:04:55.040 --> 04:05:06.400
B squared plus C squared minus two BC cosine A, or B squared equals A squared plus C squared

04:05:06.400 --> 04:05:15.200
minus two AC cosine B. We can use whichever of these three forms is most convenient for the

04:05:15.200 --> 04:05:21.840
problem at hand. Let's use the law of cosines to find the side lengths and angles of this triangle.

04:05:22.800 --> 04:05:31.120
By convention, I'm going to call the side opposite angle B side little B, and the side

04:05:31.120 --> 04:05:39.360
opposite angle A side little A. Since we know two side lengths and the angle between them,

04:05:39.920 --> 04:05:46.320
we have all the information on the right side of the law of cosines. So I'll plug that in

04:05:48.560 --> 04:05:57.760
and use a calculator in degree mode to find that C squared equals 44.44. Taking the square root,

04:05:57.760 --> 04:06:06.800
I get that C equals 6.67. Next, I'll use the law of cosines to find the angle B.

04:06:07.760 --> 04:06:14.400
I'll need to use a version of the law of cosines that mentions cosine of angle B here. So it'll need

04:06:14.400 --> 04:06:21.520
to mention side length little B here. So that'll be the form B squared on the left.

04:06:22.320 --> 04:06:31.840
I'll get A squared plus C squared minus two AC cosine B on the right. I'll plug in values

04:06:31.840 --> 04:06:40.240
for all my side lengths. And now I can solve for cosine B by subtracting 8 squared and 6.67

04:06:40.240 --> 04:06:48.480
squared from both sides, and now dividing both sides by negative 2 times 8 times 6.67. Using a

04:06:48.480 --> 04:06:59.280
calculator, this gives me that cosine of B is equal to negative 0.1172. The negative value

04:06:59.280 --> 04:07:05.360
of cosine indicates that my angle B must be greater than 90 degrees, which agrees with the picture.

04:07:07.040 --> 04:07:16.480
Next, I can take cosine inverse of both sides to get that B is equal to cosine inverse of negative

04:07:16.480 --> 04:07:27.440
0.1172, which works out to 96.73 degrees. The last thing I have to do is solve for angle A.

04:07:28.400 --> 04:07:33.760
I could use law of cosines again and work it out just like I did here for angle B.

04:07:34.720 --> 04:07:40.560
But a simpler method is to just use the fact that the sum of the three angles is 180 degrees.

04:07:42.000 --> 04:07:56.080
So A must be 180 degrees minus 37 degrees minus 96.73 degrees. This works out to 46.27 degrees.

04:07:57.920 --> 04:08:02.080
In the previous example, we were given two sides and the angle between them.

04:08:02.960 --> 04:08:08.560
In this angle, we're given instead three side lengths, and we need to find all three angles.

04:08:09.760 --> 04:08:14.640
Although there are a lot of computations involved, the ideas are the same as in the previous problem.

04:08:15.440 --> 04:08:23.280
To find angle C, we need the form of the law of cosines that has cosine of C on the right side.

04:08:23.280 --> 04:08:29.200
To find capital B, we need to use the form of the law of cosines that has cosine of B

04:08:29.200 --> 04:08:34.800
on the right side and little b on the left side. So it'll be b squared equals a squared plus c

04:08:34.800 --> 04:08:43.360
squared minus 2ac cosine b. And to find angle A, we need little a squared on the left side

04:08:44.880 --> 04:08:52.560
so that we'll get cosine of angle A on the right side. For each of these three equations,

04:08:52.560 --> 04:08:59.520
I'll plug in the side lengths, solve for the cosine of the angle, and use inverse cosine to

04:08:59.520 --> 04:09:09.760
find my angles. Notice that my three angles, 60 degrees, 87.79 degrees, and 32.20 degrees,

04:09:09.760 --> 04:09:16.560
add up to almost exactly 180 degrees. It's just a tiny bit off due to round off error. In fact,

04:09:16.560 --> 04:09:21.520
I could have saved myself some work by just finding the measure of angle C and the measure of angle

04:09:21.520 --> 04:09:27.040
B, for example, and then subtracting their sum from 180 degrees to get angle A.

04:09:28.640 --> 04:09:36.240
In this video, we stated the law of cosines and used it to solve some triangles. The law of cosines

04:09:36.240 --> 04:09:41.760
can be thought of as the Pythagorean theorem with an adjustment factor to account for triangles

04:09:41.760 --> 04:09:48.000
that aren't right triangles. The law of signs is a tool that can be used to solve triangles that

04:09:48.000 --> 04:09:54.240
are not necessarily right triangles. It's especially useful when we know two angles and one side.

04:09:55.520 --> 04:10:00.640
And it can also be used in the situation where we know two sides and an angle that's not between

04:10:00.640 --> 04:10:09.360
them. The law of signs says that for a triangle with angles A, B, and C opposite to sides,

04:10:10.160 --> 04:10:19.440
locates A, B, and C respectively, the sign of angle A divided by the length of side A

04:10:19.440 --> 04:10:26.800
is equal to the sign of B over B, which is also equal to the sign of C over C.

04:10:28.160 --> 04:10:34.640
Notice that we're taking the sign of the three angles and dividing by the three opposite side

04:10:34.640 --> 04:10:45.360
lengths. Suppose we know that angle A is 55 degrees, angle C is 67 degrees, and side B is 20 degrees.

04:10:46.640 --> 04:10:51.520
We want to solve the triangle, that is, find the lengths of the other sides and the measure

04:10:51.520 --> 04:10:58.560
of the third angle. Since we know two angles already, we can find the third angle by subtracting

04:10:58.560 --> 04:11:07.520
from 180 degrees. So angle B is 58 degrees. Now I can use the law of signs to find my

04:11:07.520 --> 04:11:18.160
remaining side lengths. To find side A, I'll use the fact that sign of angle A over side

04:11:18.160 --> 04:11:25.760
length A is equal to sign of angle B over side length B. Since I already know three of these

04:11:25.760 --> 04:11:33.360
quantities, angle A, angle B, and side length B, I can plug in and solve for the unknown

04:11:34.400 --> 04:11:42.320
side length A. To solve, I'll multiply both sides by A and then multiply both sides by 20 over the

04:11:42.320 --> 04:11:54.640
sign of 58 degrees. That gives me that A is equal to 20 sine 55 over sine 58, which works out to

04:11:54.640 --> 04:12:04.400
19.32. Please pause the video and use the same method to find side length C. This time, we need to

04:12:04.400 --> 04:12:14.720
involve sine of C and side length C in our equation. And we could use either the B's or the A's,

04:12:14.720 --> 04:12:23.440
since they're both known for the other side. I'll plug in values as I can and solve for C. C works out

04:12:23.440 --> 04:12:34.720
to 21.71. In the previous example, we used the law of signs to find the side lengths of a triangle,

04:12:34.720 --> 04:12:41.040
because we already knew the angles. In this next example, we're given some side lengths,

04:12:41.840 --> 04:12:47.760
and we're going to need to solve for some angles. This can be tricky, because when we write down the

04:12:47.760 --> 04:12:56.560
law of signs and start solving for an angle, we first solve for sine of the angle. But there can be

04:12:56.560 --> 04:13:04.640
two plausible angles that both have the same sign. For example, if sine of the angle happens to be

04:13:04.640 --> 04:13:17.440
one half, then the angle could be either 30 degrees or 150 degrees. In some cases,

04:13:17.440 --> 04:13:24.000
this can lead to two possible triangles that both have the conditions given. When this happens,

04:13:24.000 --> 04:13:29.600
and there are two possible solutions, I call this an ambiguous case. With that warning,

04:13:29.600 --> 04:13:36.000
let's figure out the details of this example. Plugging in my given information into the law

04:13:36.000 --> 04:13:42.320
of signs, I'll focus on this portion of the equation where there's only one unknown to solve for.

04:13:43.360 --> 04:13:50.080
First, I'll solve for sine of A, which is 8 times sine 40 degrees over 7,

04:13:50.960 --> 04:14:01.920
which works out to 0.7346. From the unit circle, I can see that there'll be two possible angles

04:14:01.920 --> 04:14:09.440
with this sine, one in the first quadrant and one in the second quadrant. If I take sine inverse

04:14:09.440 --> 04:14:20.240
of both sides of my equation, I get the solution in the first quadrant, which is 47.27 degrees.

04:14:21.680 --> 04:14:29.840
Since this angle right here is 47.27 degrees, so is this angle here. And so the angle

04:14:29.840 --> 04:14:36.000
that I want in the second quadrant, I can get by going 180 minus 47.27 degrees,

04:14:36.880 --> 04:14:45.840
which works out to 132.73. One of these possible angles, it's an acute angle,

04:14:45.840 --> 04:14:51.120
the other one at obtuse angle, but both are possible configurations. I'll sketch the possible

04:14:51.120 --> 04:15:00.480
triangles. In both triangles, side length A and B are the same, and angle B is the same,

04:15:00.480 --> 04:15:05.600
but everything else is different. We can continue to solve for the other angle

04:15:05.600 --> 04:15:10.800
and side in each case. In the left side, I'll call this case one.

04:15:12.720 --> 04:15:20.560
We can solve for angle C by taking 180 degrees minus angle B minus angle A.

04:15:21.440 --> 04:15:31.760
That gives us an angle just over 90 degrees, 92.73 degrees. Now we can use either the law of

04:15:31.760 --> 04:15:37.360
sines or the law of cosines to find the final side length C. I'll use the law of sines again.

04:15:38.480 --> 04:15:43.280
So I'll plug in the value of angle C into this part of my equation

04:15:44.240 --> 04:15:55.200
and solve for C to get C equals sine 92.73 degrees times seven over sine 40 degrees,

04:15:56.320 --> 04:16:05.120
which works out to 10.88. For the right-hand triangle, we can carry out the same steps

04:16:05.200 --> 04:16:12.560
to get angle C and now plug into the law of sines to get side length C.

04:16:14.240 --> 04:16:20.560
We finish solving for the two possible triangles with these given side lengths and angle.

04:16:22.160 --> 04:16:27.680
In this video, we used the law of sines to solve a triangle in two different situations. In the

04:16:27.680 --> 04:16:38.160
first situation, we had two angles and the side between them. So that's an ASA triangle for angle

04:16:38.160 --> 04:16:45.040
side angle. In that situation, we ended up just using the law of sines to solve for side lengths

04:16:45.040 --> 04:16:51.440
and there was no ambiguity. In the second situation, we had a triangle where we knew two

04:16:51.440 --> 04:16:58.240
side lengths and an angle that was not between them. So I'll call that SSA and in that case,

04:16:58.240 --> 04:17:06.800
we did find two possible triangles that would work. The SSA situation doesn't always give two

04:17:06.800 --> 04:17:13.040
possible triangles. Sometimes when you go through the two cases and figure out all the other angles

04:17:13.040 --> 04:17:18.240
and side lengths, you'll get an impossible situation and the angle, for example, that's

04:17:18.240 --> 04:17:24.080
has to be negative because the other two angles add up to more than 180 degrees.

04:17:25.680 --> 04:17:29.920
But you do have to be on the lookout for two possible triangles when you're solving

04:17:29.920 --> 04:17:37.280
a triangle with the SSA information given. This video describes some of the features of a parabola.

04:17:38.080 --> 04:17:45.440
It's vertex, focus and directrix. I want to start by finding the equation of all points

04:17:45.520 --> 04:17:54.080
that are equidistant the same distance from a point zero P on the y axis and the horizontal line

04:17:54.080 --> 04:17:59.520
y equals negative P. I'm assuming here that P is positive for starters.

04:18:00.960 --> 04:18:06.160
Certainly the origin will be among those points as it has a distance of P from the point

04:18:06.800 --> 04:18:13.840
and P from the line. But the other points on the x axis will be closer to the line

04:18:13.840 --> 04:18:18.560
than they are to the point. So if I want the set of points that are the same distance from the

04:18:18.560 --> 04:18:25.680
point in the line, that's going to be a curve that curves upwards, something like this. So for

04:18:25.680 --> 04:18:32.000
example, a point out here will be the same distance from the point as it is from the line.

04:18:33.280 --> 04:18:39.360
So our intuition is suggesting that this set of points should be the shape of a parabola.

04:18:39.360 --> 04:18:46.800
Let's confirm this with some algebra. If we take an arbitrary point with coordinates x y,

04:18:47.760 --> 04:18:56.080
its distance from the point zero P is given by the distance formula x minus zero squared plus

04:18:56.080 --> 04:19:05.280
y minus p squared. Its distance from the line y equals negative P is just given by its difference

04:19:05.280 --> 04:19:15.120
in y coordinates. So that's going to be y minus negative P or y plus P.

04:19:16.720 --> 04:19:19.120
Let me set these two quantities equal to each other.

04:19:20.720 --> 04:19:27.680
And simplify, I can square both sides. To get on the left x minus zero squared with the same

04:19:27.680 --> 04:19:35.760
thing as x squared plus y minus p squared equals y plus p squared. Now I'll distribute out that gives

04:19:35.760 --> 04:19:48.800
me x squared plus y squared minus 2 p y plus p squared equals y squared plus 2 p y plus p squared.

04:19:49.040 --> 04:19:58.480
The p squareds cancel out as do the y squareds. And I'm left with x squared equals 4 p y after

04:19:58.480 --> 04:20:07.760
moving this negative 2 p y to the other side. I could also write this as y equals one over 4 p x

04:20:07.760 --> 04:20:14.960
squared. And you might recognize this as the standard parabola y equals x squared, transformed by

04:20:14.960 --> 04:20:21.360
vertically stretched stretching or shrinking it by this factor of one over 4 p. You might recall that

04:20:21.360 --> 04:20:29.680
this lowest point of the parabola is called the vertex. This point here is called its focus. And

04:20:29.680 --> 04:20:38.800
the line here is called the directrix. Notice that the number P in this equation represents the

04:20:38.800 --> 04:20:45.680
distance between the vertex and the focus and also represents the distance between the vertex and

04:20:45.680 --> 04:20:52.640
the directrix line. For this reason, if you're interested in the focus and the vertex, this form

04:20:52.640 --> 04:20:59.680
of the equation might be more useful than the equivalent form, something like y equals ax squared,

04:20:59.680 --> 04:21:06.880
where the that distance p is more hidden. Now so far, we've just considered the case when p is greater

04:21:07.520 --> 04:21:13.520
than zero. Let's look for a moment at what happens when p is less than zero. Then when we draw the point

04:21:13.520 --> 04:21:23.040
zero p is going to be below the x axis. And the directrix y equals negative p is going to be above

04:21:23.040 --> 04:21:28.000
the x axis because we're taking the negative of a negative number makes it a positive y value.

04:21:29.040 --> 04:21:31.360
Our parabola will also be upside down.

04:21:31.360 --> 04:21:40.560
All the algebra works out the same, it's just in our equation, this coefficient of y will now be a

04:21:40.560 --> 04:21:46.080
negative number instead of a positive one. Or if we write it in this other form, which might be more

04:21:46.080 --> 04:21:51.280
familiar, our coefficient of x squared will be negative instead of positive, which signifies that

04:21:51.280 --> 04:21:58.320
the parabola is pointing down. Since p is now a negative number, if we want to talk about distances,

04:21:58.400 --> 04:22:06.640
we should write absolute value of p instead of p. Next, let's turn things sideways by looking at the

04:22:06.640 --> 04:22:14.320
equation for all points equidistance from point p zero, on the x axis, here we're assuming for

04:22:14.320 --> 04:22:20.560
starters that p is bigger than zero, and a vertical line at x equals negative p.

04:22:22.320 --> 04:22:26.080
Our intuition suggests that this should be a parabola pointing sideways.

04:22:26.320 --> 04:22:30.880
And we can work out the same algebra steps to get an equation for it.

04:22:32.160 --> 04:22:37.280
Starting with an arbitrary point x, y, the distance from the point

04:22:38.640 --> 04:22:46.160
p zero is going to be given by x minus p squared plus y minus zero squared. The distance from the

04:22:46.160 --> 04:22:54.720
line x equals negative p is going to be given by the difference in x coordinates. So that's going

04:22:54.720 --> 04:23:03.920
to be x minus negative p, or just x plus p. I'll set these two distances equal to each other,

04:23:04.720 --> 04:23:12.240
square both sides like before, and simplify. This gives me the equation y squared equals four px,

04:23:13.440 --> 04:23:21.200
which I could also rewrite as x equals one over four p y squared, or x equals a y squared,

04:23:21.200 --> 04:23:27.520
where my a corresponds to my one over four p. Once again, if p is negative,

04:23:28.720 --> 04:23:33.280
then my parabola will be pointing the opposite direction. But my equation will still be the

04:23:33.280 --> 04:23:38.560
same, it'll just have a negative coefficient of x instead of a positive one, the negative number

04:23:38.560 --> 04:23:47.440
being hidden inside this variable p. As before, the absolute value of p gives me the distance

04:23:47.440 --> 04:23:54.240
between the vertex and the focus, and also gives me the distance between the vertex and the

04:23:54.240 --> 04:24:01.440
directrix. Now let's find the equation for parabola with a vertex at some arbitrary point hk

04:24:01.440 --> 04:24:10.080
instead of the origin, assuming that the parabola opens up or down. If the parabola had its vertex

04:24:10.080 --> 04:24:16.240
at the origin, we know it would be given by the equation x squared equals four p y, or I could

04:24:16.240 --> 04:24:24.160
rewrite that as y equals one over four p x squared. So this parabola should just be shifted

04:24:25.200 --> 04:24:32.640
to the right by h and up by k. From transformations of functions, we know we can accomplish this

04:24:32.640 --> 04:24:44.320
by sticking a x minus h on the inside, and putting a plus k on the outside. In other words,

04:24:44.320 --> 04:24:54.480
we have y minus k equals one over four p times x minus h squared, or we can write this as x minus

04:24:54.480 --> 04:25:05.280
h squared equals four p times y minus k. So this is the original with the vertex at the origin. And

04:25:05.280 --> 04:25:16.560
here is the transformed by shifting right and up to have a vertex at hk. Notice that the equations

04:25:16.560 --> 04:25:24.560
are exactly the same. It's just you stuck in a minus h and a minus k near the x and near the y.

04:25:26.080 --> 04:25:32.480
This transform parabola will have its focus, a distance of p up from the vertex. So that's

04:25:32.480 --> 04:25:41.680
going to be the point h k plus p. And it's going to have its directrix at a distance p down from

04:25:41.680 --> 04:25:51.200
the vertex. So that's going to be the line y equals k minus p. Everything's the same for this other

04:25:51.200 --> 04:25:57.760
parabola pointing downwards, we just have p is negative in that case. The same story holds for

04:25:57.760 --> 04:26:05.680
the parabola is pointing right and left. The original equation, y squared equals four p x

04:26:06.400 --> 04:26:14.560
gets transformed when we ship the parabola over into y minus k squared equals four p x minus h.

04:26:15.760 --> 04:26:23.200
This time, the vertex is a distance p to the left or right of my vertex. So here it would be

04:26:24.000 --> 04:26:32.320
h plus p k. And the directrix would be shifted over by p also from the vertex. So this would be

04:26:32.320 --> 04:26:41.120
the vertical line x equals h minus p. It works the same way when the parabola is opening left

04:26:41.120 --> 04:26:47.920
instead of right. It's just in this case p is negative. Let's use this information to find the

04:26:47.920 --> 04:26:54.880
equation of a parabola with vertex at 24 and focus at negative 14. I'll start with a quick sketch,

04:26:55.440 --> 04:27:01.040
which will help me see how the parabola is lined up. So here's the vertex at 24.

04:27:02.800 --> 04:27:07.280
And the focus is at negative 14. So here's the focus here.

04:27:09.840 --> 04:27:15.520
Now, since the parabola always hugs its focus, that means that this parabola must be pointing

04:27:15.520 --> 04:27:22.560
left and look something like this. The directrix is going to be on the other side of the parabola,

04:27:22.560 --> 04:27:28.240
the same distance as the distance between the vertex and the focus. Since this distance is

04:27:28.880 --> 04:27:36.320
a distance of three to minus negative one is three, the directrix must be three units

04:27:36.320 --> 04:27:43.360
over here to the right. And so that would be the line x equals five.

04:27:45.600 --> 04:27:49.200
Since my parabola is open to the left, I know I need to use the form of the equation

04:27:50.080 --> 04:27:59.200
y minus k squared equals four p x minus h, where h k is the vertex. So that's 24.

04:27:59.840 --> 04:28:06.000
I also know that p is going to be negative. And since the absolute value of p represents

04:28:06.000 --> 04:28:12.160
the distance between the vertex and the focus, I know that p must be negative three.

04:28:12.960 --> 04:28:20.080
So filling on all these numbers, I get y minus four squared equals four times negative three

04:28:20.080 --> 04:28:28.320
times x minus two. I'll simplify that to y minus four squared equals negative 12 x minus two.

04:28:30.080 --> 04:28:34.000
In this video, we looked at special forms of the equation for a parabola.

04:28:34.000 --> 04:28:43.920
The forms y minus k squared equals four p x minus h and x minus h squared equals four p y minus k.

04:28:44.960 --> 04:28:52.400
In these equations, h k represents the vertex. And p's absolute value gives the distance

04:28:52.400 --> 04:29:04.640
between the vertex and the focus and between the vertex and the directrix.

04:29:06.560 --> 04:29:15.680
Parabolas in this form are opening right if p is bigger than zero and left if p is less than zero.

04:29:15.680 --> 04:29:23.200
And parabolas in this form are opening up if p is bigger than zero and down if p is less than zero.

04:29:24.400 --> 04:29:31.440
This video is about ellipses. Recall that a circle can be defined as a set of points

04:29:31.440 --> 04:29:38.800
whose distance from a fixed point is a constant. Any ellipse can be defined as a set of points

04:29:39.440 --> 04:29:44.000
such that the sum of the distances

04:29:47.120 --> 04:29:48.800
from two fixed points

04:29:51.120 --> 04:29:57.760
is a constant. The two fixed points are called focuses or foci.

04:30:00.000 --> 04:30:05.920
And the sum of the distances to the two foci is the total length of the string,

04:30:05.920 --> 04:30:11.040
which is held constant as I draw the ellipse. Let's examine the features of an ellipse in more

04:30:11.040 --> 04:30:20.960
detail. In these pictures, the two black dots are the focuses or foci. The red line segment

04:30:20.960 --> 04:30:26.000
that cuts through the middle of the ellipse in the long direction and passes through the foci

04:30:26.000 --> 04:30:31.360
is called the major axis. The line segment that cuts through the middle of the ellipse

04:30:31.360 --> 04:30:37.920
in the shorter direction is called the minor axis. And the two points at the tips of the ellipse,

04:30:37.920 --> 04:30:41.760
where the major axis actually touches the ellipse, are called the vertices.

04:30:43.920 --> 04:30:49.040
An ellipse could be elongated in any direction, but we'll only consider ellipses that are elongated

04:30:49.040 --> 04:30:55.280
either in the horizontal direction, or the vertical direction. Let's find the equation of an ellipse

04:30:56.240 --> 04:31:06.960
whose foci are at negative C, zero, and C zero, and whose vertices are at negative a zero,

04:31:07.920 --> 04:31:13.520
and a zero. This will be an ellipse that's elongated in the horizontal direction.

04:31:14.880 --> 04:31:22.240
For any point x y on the ellipse, the sum of the distance from x y to the first focus,

04:31:22.880 --> 04:31:28.880
plus its distance to the second focus has to be some constant. And in fact,

04:31:28.880 --> 04:31:35.920
it turns out that constant has to equal to a, I'll show you why. If you look at this point

04:31:35.920 --> 04:31:43.200
right here on the far right tip of the ellipse, its distance from the first focus is going to be

04:31:43.920 --> 04:31:52.720
two C plus a minus C. And its distance from the second focus is just going to be a minus C.

04:31:53.440 --> 04:32:00.960
If you add up C plus C plus a minus C plus a minus C, you get exactly two a.

04:32:02.400 --> 04:32:08.160
So let me write out my formulas for distances. The distance from a point x y to the first focus,

04:32:08.240 --> 04:32:15.840
the point negative C zero is going to be the square root of x minus negative C squared

04:32:15.840 --> 04:32:22.320
plus y minus zero squared. And the distance from x y to the second focus, the point C zero,

04:32:22.960 --> 04:32:29.360
is going to be the square root of x minus C squared plus y minus zero squared. That

04:32:29.360 --> 04:32:36.400
sum needs to add up to two a. After a fair amount of algebra, this simplifies to the expression

04:32:36.800 --> 04:32:45.680
a squared minus C squared, x squared plus a squared y squared equals a squared times a squared

04:32:45.680 --> 04:32:53.760
minus C squared. If we let b squared equal a squared minus C squared, then we can rewrite this

04:32:53.760 --> 04:33:01.520
as b squared x squared plus a squared y squared equals a squared b squared. And dividing both sides

04:33:01.520 --> 04:33:07.760
by a squared b squared, this gives us the form of the equation for the ellipse x squared over a

04:33:07.760 --> 04:33:16.640
squared plus y squared over b squared equals one. Since we got b squared as a squared minus C squared,

04:33:16.640 --> 04:33:24.960
it follows that b is less than a. In fact, b is half the length of the minor axis. In other words,

04:33:24.960 --> 04:33:31.760
this point right here is the point zero b. And this point is the point zero negative b.

04:33:33.200 --> 04:33:39.840
To see why this is true, let's draw these two right triangles. The sum of the side lengths

04:33:39.840 --> 04:33:46.080
that I've drawn has to be the total length of the string. So that equals two a, which means each of

04:33:46.080 --> 04:33:53.600
these side lengths must be a. Now the base of this triangle is C. So by the Pythagorean theorem,

04:33:54.320 --> 04:34:00.880
this height squared must be a squared minus C squared. Since b squared is defined as a squared

04:34:00.880 --> 04:34:08.720
minus C squared, this height must be b. To summarize, for a number a bigger than b,

04:34:08.720 --> 04:34:15.120
the equation x squared over a squared plus y squared over b squared equals one represents

04:34:15.120 --> 04:34:18.880
an ellipse that's elongated

04:34:21.280 --> 04:34:30.320
in the horizontal direction, whose major axis terminates in the points minus a zero and a zero,

04:34:31.040 --> 04:34:38.000
and whose minor axis terminates in the points zero b and zero minus b.

04:34:38.160 --> 04:34:47.120
It's foci are at the points negative C zero and C zero. And the relationship between a b and c is

04:34:47.120 --> 04:34:55.440
that b squared is a squared minus c squared. Equivalently, if we add c squared to both sides

04:34:55.440 --> 04:35:01.520
and subtract b squared from both sides, we can write c squared equals a squared minus b squared.

04:35:02.320 --> 04:35:07.200
The way I remember this is that the biggest of the three numbers a b and c is definitely going to

04:35:07.840 --> 04:35:13.600
be a, since a is half the length of the major axis, which is bigger than half the length of

04:35:13.600 --> 04:35:19.360
the minor axis, and definitely bigger than the length between the origin and one of the focuses.

04:35:20.720 --> 04:35:25.200
Since a is the biggest, and we have a Pythagorean theorem relationship between a b and c,

04:35:26.000 --> 04:35:30.720
the equation must be b squared plus c squared equals a squared, which can be rearranged to

04:35:30.800 --> 04:35:37.680
either of these two equations. Now, what happens instead, if we have a bigger than b still,

04:35:37.680 --> 04:35:42.240
but this time we're dividing y squared by the bigger number squared, and x squared by the

04:35:42.240 --> 04:35:47.600
smaller number squared. Well, this basically reverses the roles of x and y in my equation.

04:35:48.720 --> 04:35:54.560
And so we end up with the major axis on the y axis stretching between the points, zero a

04:35:55.520 --> 04:36:01.600
and zero negative a, whereas the minor axis is going to be along the x axis, going in between

04:36:02.160 --> 04:36:08.720
negative b zero and b zero, and the foci are going to be here on the y axis again.

04:36:09.680 --> 04:36:14.080
So in this case, my ellipse is elongated in the vertical direction.

04:36:16.480 --> 04:36:21.040
Our previous ellipses were centered at the origin. What if the ellipse is centered instead

04:36:21.040 --> 04:36:27.680
at an arbitrary point hk? Well, then we need to shift everything over by h in the horizontal

04:36:27.680 --> 04:36:33.520
direction and k in the vertical direction. So instead of the equation x squared over a squared

04:36:33.520 --> 04:36:40.960
plus y squared over b squared equals one, we're going to have to have x minus h squared over a

04:36:40.960 --> 04:36:49.120
squared plus y minus k squared over b squared equals one, where a is bigger than b. That's

04:36:49.120 --> 04:36:54.800
for an ellipse elongated in the horizontal direction. If we want an ellipse elongated in the

04:36:54.800 --> 04:37:01.280
vertical direction, we'll still take a bigger than b, but we'll reverse the roles of x and y. So this

04:37:01.280 --> 04:37:07.360
becomes x squared over b squared plus y squared over a squared equals one for the center at the

04:37:07.360 --> 04:37:15.600
origin. And to shift it over, we get x minus h squared over b squared plus y minus k squared

04:37:15.600 --> 04:37:22.960
over a squared equals one. I'll draw some pictures below. With some thought, we can label key

04:37:22.960 --> 04:37:29.600
points. For example, this vertex must be shifted over by an amount a since a is half the length of

04:37:29.600 --> 04:37:38.800
the major axis. So it'll have coordinates h plus a k, whereas this vertex will be h minus a k. This

04:37:38.800 --> 04:37:52.240
point up here should be h k plus b, and this one h k minus b. The foci are at h plus c k, and h minus

04:37:52.240 --> 04:37:59.120
c k. We can label the points on the ellipse that's elongated vertically. Similarly,

04:38:01.280 --> 04:38:05.280
let's write the equation of the ellipse drawn below, and then we'll find its foci.

04:38:06.160 --> 04:38:12.960
Its major axis is in the vertical direction, right here. Its top vertex is at the point

04:38:13.680 --> 04:38:23.120
for three, as bottom vertex is at the point for negative nine. Its center is halfway between

04:38:23.120 --> 04:38:30.800
its two vertices, which is right here at the point for negative three. Finally, I can read off the

04:38:30.800 --> 04:38:39.520
points at the end of the minor axis. So this one is at nine negative three, and this one is at negative

04:38:39.520 --> 04:38:45.200
one negative three. Since my ellipse is elongated vertically, I know I have an equation of the

04:38:45.200 --> 04:38:53.520
form x minus h squared over b squared plus y minus k squared over a squared equals one with a bigger

04:38:53.520 --> 04:39:02.640
than b. My center is my point h k, and that's equal to four, negative three. A is half the

04:39:02.640 --> 04:39:09.040
length of the major axis. So that's the vertical distance between this point and this point,

04:39:09.040 --> 04:39:15.200
I can just take the difference of y coordinates and see that a is equal to six. B is half the

04:39:15.200 --> 04:39:20.640
length of the minor axis. So looking at the difference in x coordinates of these two points,

04:39:20.720 --> 04:39:28.800
I see that B is equal to five. Throwing that all into my equation, I get that x minus four squared

04:39:28.800 --> 04:39:37.360
over five squared plus y plus three squared over six squared equals one. The foci are going to be

04:39:37.360 --> 04:39:44.720
somewhere along the major axis, somewhere above and below the center. To figure out how far they

04:39:44.720 --> 04:39:51.520
are, I need to use the fact that c squared is equal to a squared minus b squared. So in this case,

04:39:51.520 --> 04:39:57.760
c squared is six squared minus five squared, which is 11, which means that c is a square root of 11,

04:39:57.760 --> 04:40:05.360
which is a little bit bigger than three. So the two foci are distance of square root of 11 above

04:40:05.360 --> 04:40:09.040
and below the center. And so they'll have coordinates

04:40:11.440 --> 04:40:18.880
of four, negative three plus the square root of 11. And four, negative three minus the square

04:40:18.880 --> 04:40:26.960
root of 11. This video detailed the anatomy of ellipse, including its major axis, its minor axis,

04:40:27.920 --> 04:40:35.280
its vertices, and its foci. This video is about hyperbola.

04:40:37.920 --> 04:40:47.600
You might recall that any ellipse is the set of points x, y, such that the sum of the distances

04:40:47.600 --> 04:40:56.800
between x, y, and two fixed points called the foci is a constant. Well, a hyperbola is a set of

04:40:56.800 --> 04:41:10.480
points x, y, such that the difference of the distances between x, y, and each of two fixed

04:41:10.480 --> 04:41:21.120
points, called the foci, is a constant. In this picture on the left, the two blue lines

04:41:21.840 --> 04:41:28.400
are the two branches of the hyperbola. The two red points are the focuses or foci.

04:41:29.760 --> 04:41:37.440
So for a point x, y on the hyperbola, if I look at the distance from x, y to one focus,

04:41:38.080 --> 04:41:44.880
and the distance from x, y to the other focus, the difference of those two distances

04:41:44.880 --> 04:41:51.280
will be the same, no matter which point x, y on the hyperbola that I choose.

04:41:52.720 --> 04:41:55.600
If I draw a line between the two foci,

04:41:57.840 --> 04:42:04.000
that line is called the transverse axis. In this left picture, we have a vertical

04:42:04.000 --> 04:42:10.960
transverse axis. And the hyperbola itself reminds me of a person lying down horizontally.

04:42:11.840 --> 04:42:18.240
Now in the right picture, our transverse axis between the two foci is horizontal.

04:42:19.280 --> 04:42:24.080
And the blue hyperbola itself kind of reminds me of a person standing up vertically.

04:42:25.360 --> 04:42:30.960
It's possible for a hyperbola to be oriented other ways, besides horizontally and vertically,

04:42:30.960 --> 04:42:35.280
but we'll only consider horizontal and vertical orientations in this video.

04:42:36.480 --> 04:42:42.160
If you look at where the transverse axis intersects the blue branches of the hyperbola,

04:42:42.800 --> 04:42:50.240
you'll find these two points. Those points are called the vertices. Notice that the vertices

04:42:50.240 --> 04:42:56.000
are the two points on the two branches that are closest to one another. The point halfway

04:42:56.000 --> 04:43:02.160
between the two vertices, it's also halfway between the two foci, is called the center of the hyperbola.

04:43:03.920 --> 04:43:10.000
The two black dotted lines that I've drawn that form an x are not actually part of the hyperbola.

04:43:10.720 --> 04:43:16.160
They're called the asymptotes. And you can think of them as guidelines for drawing the hyperbola,

04:43:16.160 --> 04:43:20.240
because the hyperbola gets closer and closer to these asymptotes, but doesn't cross them.

04:43:20.800 --> 04:43:22.640
We'll talk more about the asymptotes later.

04:43:23.920 --> 04:43:29.920
Let's find the equation of a hyperbola with foci at negative c zero and c zero,

04:43:29.920 --> 04:43:36.160
and vertices at negative a zero and a zero. This hyperbola will have its center at the origin.

04:43:37.280 --> 04:43:43.360
From the distance definition of hyperbola, we know that if we have a point x y on the hyperbola,

04:43:44.160 --> 04:43:47.840
then if we take the distance from that point to the first focus,

04:43:48.560 --> 04:43:53.360
and the distance to the second focus, and subtract them, we should get a constant.

04:43:54.640 --> 04:43:59.520
We're always taking the positive difference here. So if we're on the right branch, we'll take the

04:43:59.520 --> 04:44:05.520
distance to the left focus minus the shorter distance to the right focus. And if we happen to be

04:44:05.520 --> 04:44:13.280
on the left branch, then we would take the longer distance to the right focus minus the

04:44:13.280 --> 04:44:17.600
shorter distance to the left focus. When we do the differences that way, we should always get

04:44:17.600 --> 04:44:24.560
the same number. And in fact, that difference should equal to a, I'll show you why. The reason is,

04:44:24.560 --> 04:44:31.120
if I take my point to be this vertex here, then its distance to this focus is exactly

04:44:31.840 --> 04:44:40.720
c minus a because c is bigger than a. And this distance to that focus is going to be, well,

04:44:40.720 --> 04:44:48.160
let's see, this is a, this is a, and this is c minus a. So that different distance will be a plus

04:44:48.160 --> 04:44:56.800
a plus c minus a. Now I'm going to do the difference a plus a plus c minus a minus c minus a.

04:44:57.040 --> 04:45:09.440
That simplifies to a plus c minus c plus a, which is to a. Now I'll focus on a point on the right

04:45:09.440 --> 04:45:14.560
branch. And I'll actually write a formula for its distance to this point. That's the distance

04:45:14.560 --> 04:45:23.360
formula. It's going to be x minus negative c squared plus y minus zero squared. That's the

04:45:23.360 --> 04:45:29.360
longer difference distance. Now I subtract the shorter distance, which is the distance

04:45:29.360 --> 04:45:35.760
to this focus. And there the distance formula gives me x minus c squared plus y minus zero

04:45:35.760 --> 04:45:42.560
squared. That should always equal to a for any point on that right branch. I'll clean up the

04:45:42.560 --> 04:45:48.400
inside of the square roots a little bit. After that, a chunk of algebra, which I won't do here

04:45:48.400 --> 04:45:57.520
here, allows you to simplify this equation to c squared minus a squared times x squared minus a

04:45:57.520 --> 04:46:04.080
squared y squared equals a squared times c squared minus a squared. Since this expression, c squared

04:46:04.080 --> 04:46:09.200
minus a squared is appearing a couple times here, I'm going to give it a new name. I'm going to let

04:46:09.200 --> 04:46:15.440
b squared b c squared minus a squared. Now I can rewrite my equation as b squared x squared minus

04:46:15.520 --> 04:46:21.680
a squared y squared equals a squared b squared. And dividing both sides by a squared b squared

04:46:22.800 --> 04:46:29.440
yields the equation x squared over a squared minus y squared over b squared equals one.

04:46:32.000 --> 04:46:38.080
In this equation, notice that a represents the distance from the center to a vertex.

04:46:38.320 --> 04:46:44.480
The quantity c is not directly in this equation, but it's related to a and b

04:46:45.360 --> 04:46:51.360
by this equation, which can also be rewritten as c squared equals a squared plus b squared,

04:46:51.360 --> 04:46:58.320
or if you prefer a squared equals c squared minus b squared. I remember this one. I remember that c,

04:46:58.320 --> 04:47:03.440
which is the distance from the center to the focus, is the largest of the three quantities a b and c.

04:47:04.400 --> 04:47:08.960
So you might be wondering, well, what does b represent? Well, I'm going to draw a box

04:47:09.520 --> 04:47:16.800
whose center is at the center of my hyperbola that stretches out in a from either direction left

04:47:16.800 --> 04:47:25.280
right and stretches up by b in either direction up and down. It turns out that the corners of

04:47:25.280 --> 04:47:33.840
such a box will be exactly on these two asymptote lines. In other words, the slope of this asymptote,

04:47:34.400 --> 04:47:42.160
its rise over its run is b over a. And for this asymptote that's slipping downwards,

04:47:42.160 --> 04:47:49.280
its rise over its run is negative b over a. So I can actually write the equations of the asymptotes

04:47:50.000 --> 04:48:02.640
for this hyperbola centered at the origin as y equals b over a x and y equals negative b over a x.

04:48:03.680 --> 04:48:08.880
We did all this work for a standing up hyperbola with its transverse axis oriented horizontally.

04:48:10.240 --> 04:48:14.880
Let me rearrange things and we'll see what changes if the hyperbola is oriented the other way.

04:48:15.840 --> 04:48:19.120
In this case, where we have a vertical transverse axis,

04:48:19.840 --> 04:48:25.600
the roles of x and y are completely switched. So our equation, which we could derive the same way

04:48:26.400 --> 04:48:32.160
becomes y squared over a squared minus x squared over b squared equals one.

04:48:32.960 --> 04:48:38.400
We still have the same formulas c squared equals a squared plus b squared. And the two related

04:48:38.400 --> 04:48:43.680
formulas b squared equals c squared minus a squared and a squared equals c squared minus b squared.

04:48:43.680 --> 04:48:50.480
A is still the distance from the center to the vertex. And C still represents the distance

04:48:50.480 --> 04:48:58.640
from the center to a focus. Now our box will extend up and down by a units and left and right by b

04:48:58.640 --> 04:49:07.680
units. So this time, the slope of the asymptote, the rise over the run is going to be a over b

04:49:08.640 --> 04:49:14.960
for the line that's sloped up, and negative a over b for the line that's sloped down.

04:49:15.840 --> 04:49:21.520
This means our asymptotes, which go through the center at the origin will be given by the

04:49:21.520 --> 04:49:29.360
equations y equals a over b x and y equals negative a over b x. I want to point out that in this

04:49:29.360 --> 04:49:36.720
notation, a is going with x in one form of the equation and y in the other form of the equation,

04:49:36.800 --> 04:49:42.560
but it always goes with the positive term, the term that's added instead of subtracted, whereas b

04:49:43.440 --> 04:49:50.000
goes with the negative term, the term that's subtracted. Which term is positive, the x squared

04:49:50.000 --> 04:49:56.000
or the y squared determines the orientation of the hyperbola this way or that way.

04:49:57.200 --> 04:50:01.600
So far, we've been considering only hyperbola centered at the origin, and we had these two

04:50:01.600 --> 04:50:10.640
equations for them. If we center at an arbitrary point, hk instead, we just subtract h from the x

04:50:10.640 --> 04:50:21.600
term and subtract k from the y term. The graphs are shifted over by h and up by k. And to get to

04:50:21.600 --> 04:50:34.480
the vertices, we just start at the center and go left and right by a or up and down by a, depending

04:50:34.480 --> 04:50:44.880
on which way the hyperbola is oriented. So the vertices here are at h plus a k and h minus a k,

04:50:45.600 --> 04:50:53.280
whereas over here, the vertices are at hk plus a and hk minus a.

04:50:55.120 --> 04:51:03.760
To get to the focuses, we have to go over by C, or up and down by C,

04:51:05.120 --> 04:51:11.200
where c squared equals a squared plus b squared. Finally, the asymptotes

04:51:11.200 --> 04:51:18.160
still have the same slopes as before. But this time, they have to go through the center, which is at

04:51:18.160 --> 04:51:26.320
hk instead of zero zero, their equations are going to be given by y minus k equals b over a x minus h.

04:51:26.960 --> 04:51:35.920
And y minus k is negative b over a x minus h. Or with the other orientation, the analogous thing,

04:51:35.920 --> 04:51:44.640
y minus k equals a over b x minus h, and y minus k equals a over b negative a over b x minus h.

04:51:46.240 --> 04:51:51.520
We've done all the abstract theory. Let's do one example with numbers. If we're given this

04:51:51.520 --> 04:52:00.640
hyperbola, we can read off its center as six negative three. Since the x term is positive,

04:52:00.720 --> 04:52:05.120
I'm going to let a be the square root of four, and b will be the square root of 25.

04:52:06.800 --> 04:52:12.160
Since the x term is positive, and the y term is negative, the hyperbola is going to be oriented

04:52:12.160 --> 04:52:23.280
standing up like this, with a horizontal transverse axis. The distance from the center to each vertex

04:52:23.280 --> 04:52:31.040
is given by the number a, which is two. So the left vertex will have coordinates for negative

04:52:31.040 --> 04:52:39.200
three, and the right vertex will have coordinates, eight, negative three. To find the foci, I need

04:52:39.200 --> 04:52:48.080
to figure out c squared, which is a squared plus b squared, or four plus 2529. So c is the square

04:52:48.080 --> 04:52:55.840
root of 29. I'll sketch ballpark position of my foci here. And the coordinates are going to be

04:52:56.960 --> 04:53:04.480
at, let's see, the center is six, so six minus square root of 29, same y coordinate of negative

04:53:04.480 --> 04:53:12.960
three, and six plus square root of 29, negative three. Finally, the asymptotes will form an x

04:53:12.960 --> 04:53:23.920
going through the center with slope given by b over a, which is five halves, and negative b over a,

04:53:23.920 --> 04:53:31.920
negative five halves. The equations for those lines will be y plus three, coming from the center,

04:53:31.920 --> 04:53:39.120
equals five halves, x minus six, and y plus three equals negative five halves, x minus six.

04:53:40.080 --> 04:53:44.080
This gives a decent rough sketch of the hyperbola. If I want to be a little more accurate, I could

04:53:44.080 --> 04:53:51.120
also plot some points by plugging in values of x and solving for y or vice versa. In this video,

04:53:51.120 --> 04:53:58.480
we gave two equations for hyperbolas, which one you use depends on how the hyperbola is oriented.

04:53:59.600 --> 04:54:06.320
A has to do with the distance between the center and the vertex, the number c, which can be figured

04:54:06.560 --> 04:54:11.760
out from the equation c squared equals a squared plus b squared, is going to represent the distance

04:54:11.760 --> 04:54:22.000
from the center to the focus. And b and a together help determine the slope of the asymptotes.

04:54:23.360 --> 04:54:29.440
This video introduces the idea of polar coordinates. Polar coordinates give an alternative way of

04:54:29.440 --> 04:54:36.160
describing the location of points on the plane. Instead of describing a point in terms of its x

04:54:36.160 --> 04:54:42.720
and y coordinates, those are the Cartesian coordinates of the point. When using polar

04:54:42.720 --> 04:54:49.040
coordinates, we instead describe the point in terms of a radius r and an angle theta.

04:54:49.920 --> 04:54:58.160
r is the distance of the point from the origin, and theta is the angle that radius line makes

04:54:58.160 --> 04:55:08.960
with the positive x axis. Let's plot these points given in polar coordinates. So the eight here

04:55:08.960 --> 04:55:15.120
is the value of the radius, and the negative two thirds pi is the value of the angle theta.

04:55:16.000 --> 04:55:21.120
The negative angle means that I need to go clockwise from the positive x axis,

04:55:21.120 --> 04:55:24.560
instead of counterclockwise like I normally would for a positive angle.

04:55:24.560 --> 04:55:35.120
So here, a negative two thirds pi means that I need to go to this line right here. And the eight

04:55:35.120 --> 04:55:40.240
of for the radius means I need to go eight lines out from the origin. So my point should be around

04:55:40.240 --> 04:55:50.160
right here. The next point has a radius of five and an angle of three pi. The angle of positive

04:55:50.160 --> 04:55:56.960
three pi means that I go counterclockwise starting at the positive x axis. Here, I've gone around by

04:55:56.960 --> 04:56:04.160
two pi. And here, I've got an extra pi to make three pi. Now the radius of five means I need to go

04:56:04.160 --> 04:56:12.080
five units out from the origin. So that puts me about right here. Notice that I could have also

04:56:12.080 --> 04:56:18.480
labeled this point with the polar coordinates of five pi. There's more than one way to assign

04:56:18.480 --> 04:56:27.440
polar coordinates to a point. The next point has an angle of pi over four, and a radius of negative

04:56:27.440 --> 04:56:34.000
12. The negative radius means that I need to jump to the other side of the circle before I plot the

04:56:34.000 --> 04:56:42.240
point. In other words, instead of plotting the point at an angle of pi over four and a radius of 12,

04:56:43.200 --> 04:56:49.360
which would be about right here, I go to the opposite side of the circle and plot it at the same

04:56:49.360 --> 04:56:56.640
distance from the origin, but 180 degrees or pi radians around the circle over here.

04:56:58.960 --> 04:57:06.800
Now I could have also labeled this point using a positive radius of 12, and using an angle of pi

04:57:07.040 --> 04:57:16.320
over four plus pi, or five pi over four. And in general, a point with polar coordinates of negative

04:57:16.320 --> 04:57:25.520
r theta means the same point as the point with polar coordinates are theta plus pi. Adding pi

04:57:25.520 --> 04:57:34.560
just makes us jump around to the opposite side of the circle. To convert between polar and Cartesian

04:57:34.560 --> 04:57:43.600
coordinates, it's handy to use the following equations. First, x is equal to r cosine theta,

04:57:44.400 --> 04:57:55.760
y is equal to r sine theta, r squared is equal to x squared plus y squared, which means that r

04:57:55.760 --> 04:58:03.520
is plus or minus the square root of x squared plus y squared. And tangent theta is equal to y

04:58:03.520 --> 04:58:12.880
divided by x. Let's see where these equations come from. If we draw a point with coordinates x, y,

04:58:13.600 --> 04:58:21.760
and draw lines to make a right triangle, the height of that triangle is y, the length of the base

04:58:22.320 --> 04:58:30.080
is x, and the hypotenuse has length r theta is the measure of this interior angle.

04:58:30.080 --> 04:58:40.960
From trig, we know that cosine theta is equal to adjacent over hypotenuse. So that's x over r,

04:58:41.520 --> 04:58:51.200
which means that x is equal to r cosine theta. Similarly, sine theta is opposite over hypotenuse,

04:58:51.200 --> 04:58:59.920
that's y over r, which means that y is equal to r sine theta. That gives us the first two equations.

04:59:00.080 --> 04:59:09.040
The Pythagorean theorem tells us that x squared plus y squared is equal to r squared, and that

04:59:09.040 --> 04:59:20.080
gives us the third equation. Finally, tangent theta is opposite over adjacent. So that's y over x,

04:59:20.080 --> 04:59:27.920
which is the fourth equation. To convert five negative pi over six from polar to Cartesian

04:59:27.920 --> 04:59:36.400
coordinates, we just use the fact that x equals r cosine theta, and y equals r sine theta. So in

04:59:36.400 --> 04:59:45.600
this case, x is equal to five times cosine of negative pi over six, that's five times square root

04:59:45.600 --> 04:59:55.120
of three over two, and y is equal to five sine negative pi over six. So that's equal to negative

04:59:55.120 --> 05:00:02.560
five halves. To convert negative one negative one from Cartesian to polar coordinates,

05:00:03.840 --> 05:00:09.520
we know that negative one and negative one are x and y values. So we need to use the fact that

05:00:09.520 --> 05:00:19.280
r squared is x squared plus y squared, that is, r squared is negative one squared plus negative

05:00:19.280 --> 05:00:30.240
one squared, or two. Also, tangent theta is y over x. So that's negative one over negative one,

05:00:30.240 --> 05:00:37.760
or one. Now there's several values of r and theta that satisfy these equations. r could be

05:00:37.760 --> 05:00:46.400
squared of two, or negative the square root of two, and theta could be pi over four, or five pi

05:00:46.400 --> 05:00:55.600
over four, or we could add multiples of two pi to either of these answers. But not all combinations

05:00:55.600 --> 05:01:02.880
of r and theta get us to the right point. The point with Cartesian coordinates, negative one,

05:01:02.880 --> 05:01:11.040
negative one, lies in the third quadrant. But if we use a theta value of say pi over four,

05:01:11.040 --> 05:01:16.720
and an r value of square root of two, that would get us to the first quadrant. So instead,

05:01:17.360 --> 05:01:26.400
we need to use the polar coordinates of square root of two, and five pi over four, or if we prefer

05:01:27.120 --> 05:01:34.000
negative square root of two, and pi over four. We could also add any multiple of two pi to either

05:01:34.000 --> 05:01:39.360
of these values of theta, and get yet another way of representing the point in polar coordinates.

05:01:41.920 --> 05:01:47.920
This video talked about polar coordinates, and converting in between Cartesian coordinates

05:01:47.920 --> 05:01:51.440
and polar coordinates using some familiar equations from trig.

05:01:55.360 --> 05:02:02.000
This video introduces the idea of parametric equations. Instead of describing a curve as y

05:02:02.000 --> 05:02:09.200
equals f of x, we can describe the x coordinates and y coordinates separately in terms of a third

05:02:09.200 --> 05:02:20.640
variable, t, usually thought of as time. So we can write x as a function of t, and y as a separate

05:02:20.640 --> 05:02:28.080
function of t. This is especially useful as a way to describe curves that don't satisfy the vertical

05:02:28.080 --> 05:02:34.240
line test, and therefore can't be described traditionally as functions of y in terms of x.

05:02:34.640 --> 05:02:42.720
A Cartesian equation for a curve is an equation in terms of x and y only. Parametric equations

05:02:43.280 --> 05:02:49.920
for a curve give both x and y as functions of a third variable, usually t. The third variable

05:02:49.920 --> 05:02:56.880
is called the parameter. As our first example, let's graph the parametric equations given here

05:02:57.440 --> 05:03:06.560
on an x y coordinate axis. We'll do this by finding x and y coordinates that correspond to the same

05:03:06.560 --> 05:03:15.520
value of t. For example, when t is negative two, you can calculate that x by plugging in negative

05:03:15.520 --> 05:03:21.760
two for t gives you five, and y when you plug in negative two for t gives you eight.

05:03:21.920 --> 05:03:27.280
Please pause the video for a moment and fill in some additional values of x and y for some additional

05:03:27.280 --> 05:03:35.200
values of t. Your chart should look like this. And when we plot the x y pairs and connect the dots,

05:03:35.200 --> 05:03:42.720
we get something like this. Notice that this point over here corresponds to a t value of negative two,

05:03:42.720 --> 05:03:51.120
and this point over here corresponds to the t value of two. So if we think of t as time,

05:03:51.200 --> 05:03:59.840
we're traversing the curve in this direction. To find a Cartesian equation for this curve,

05:03:59.840 --> 05:04:06.320
we need to eliminate the variable t from these equations. One way to do this is to solve for t

05:04:06.320 --> 05:04:15.440
in one equation, say the first equation. So two t is equal to one minus x, which means that t

05:04:16.160 --> 05:04:24.240
is one half minus x over two, then we can plug that expression for t into the second equation

05:04:24.240 --> 05:04:33.760
and get y equals one half minus x over two squared plus four, which simplifies to the quadratic

05:04:33.760 --> 05:04:45.440
equation y equals one fourth x squared minus one half x plus 17 fourths. Let's try some more

05:04:45.440 --> 05:04:53.360
examples. A table of values for the first example helps us draw the familiar graph of a circle

05:04:54.000 --> 05:05:02.160
of radius one. This should come as no surprise, since the equations x equals cosine t and y equals

05:05:02.160 --> 05:05:09.360
sine t are familiar from trig as a way of describing the x and y coordinates of a point on the unit

05:05:09.360 --> 05:05:18.720
circle. Notice that when t equals zero, our curve lies on the positive x axis. And as t increases

05:05:18.720 --> 05:05:24.560
from zero to two pi, we traverse the curve once in the counterclockwise direction.

05:05:24.800 --> 05:05:32.960
A Cartesian equation for this unit circle is given by the equation x squared plus y squared

05:05:32.960 --> 05:05:41.280
equals one. This follows from the trig identity cosine squared t plus sine squared t equals one

05:05:41.280 --> 05:05:49.680
by substituting in x for cosine t and y for sine t. Please pause the video for a moment

05:05:49.680 --> 05:05:54.480
to graph the second curve and rewrite it as a Cartesian equation.

05:05:56.160 --> 05:06:02.880
A table of values should help you see that the graph is again a unit circle. But this time,

05:06:03.520 --> 05:06:10.640
as t increases from zero to two pi, we actually traverse the circle twice in the clockwise

05:06:10.640 --> 05:06:18.160
direction. I'll draw this with a double arrow moving clockwise. The Cartesian equation for this

05:06:18.160 --> 05:06:26.560
graph is still x squared plus y squared equals one. And so we found two different

05:06:26.560 --> 05:06:34.160
parameterizations for the same graph on the x y axis. Let's take a look at the third equation.

05:06:35.440 --> 05:06:40.880
There's no interval of value specified for t here. So let's just assume that t can be any real number.

05:06:41.280 --> 05:06:48.240
Now as t ranges from negative infinity to infinity, our y values, which are given by cosine t,

05:06:48.240 --> 05:06:56.800
oscillate between one and negative one. Our x values are always the square of our y values.

05:06:56.800 --> 05:07:05.680
So the graph of this curve has to lie on the graph of x equals y squared, which is a sideways

05:07:05.760 --> 05:07:12.240
parabola. But our parametrically defined curve doesn't cover this whole parabola.

05:07:12.800 --> 05:07:19.120
Remember that y is given by cosine of t. So y can only range between negative one and one.

05:07:19.120 --> 05:07:23.280
And so we're only getting the portion of the parabola that I shade in here.

05:07:24.960 --> 05:07:32.080
As t varies from say zero to pi, I traverse this parabola one time. And then as t goes from pi to

05:07:32.080 --> 05:07:39.120
two pi, I go back again in the other direction. And as t continues to increase, I traverse this

05:07:39.120 --> 05:07:46.000
parabola infinitely many times. The Cartesian equation for this curve is the equation x equals

05:07:46.000 --> 05:07:51.840
y squared with the restriction that y is between negative one and one.

05:07:55.280 --> 05:07:59.760
We've seen several examples where we went from parametric equations to Cartesian equations.

05:08:00.400 --> 05:08:05.520
Now let's start with a Cartesian equation and rewrite it as a parametric equation.

05:08:06.800 --> 05:08:13.040
In this example, y is already given as a function of x. So an easy way to parameterize this curve

05:08:13.040 --> 05:08:23.760
is to just let x equal t, and then y is equal to the square root of t squared minus t, substituting

05:08:23.760 --> 05:08:32.160
in t for x. The domain restriction in terms of x just translates into a restriction in terms of t.

05:08:34.480 --> 05:08:39.280
I call this the copycat parameterization. Since we've successfully introduced the

05:08:39.280 --> 05:08:47.200
new variable t, but t just copies whatever x does. In the second example, we could try setting x

05:08:47.200 --> 05:08:57.200
equal to t, then we get 25 t squared plus 36 y squared is equal to 900. And solving for y,

05:08:57.200 --> 05:09:04.400
we'd have y squared equals 900 minus 25 t squared over 36.

05:09:06.080 --> 05:09:15.120
So y is plus or minus the square root of this quantity. This is a very awkward looking expression.

05:09:15.120 --> 05:09:19.120
In fact, why is not even a function of t here because of the plus and minus signs.

05:09:20.160 --> 05:09:22.880
So let's look for a better way to parametrize this curve.

05:09:24.880 --> 05:09:30.160
Because of the x squared and the y squared, this equation is a good candidate for parametrizing

05:09:30.160 --> 05:09:37.520
using sine and cosine. In fact, if we divide both sides of the equation by 900, we get

05:09:38.160 --> 05:09:45.760
25 x squared over 900 plus 36 y squared over 900 is equal to one,

05:09:47.120 --> 05:09:53.920
which simplifies to x squared over 36 plus y squared over 25 is equal to one.

05:09:55.200 --> 05:10:02.640
If I rewrite this as x over six squared plus y over five squared equals one,

05:10:03.600 --> 05:10:12.160
then I can set x over six equal to cosine of t and y over five equal to sine of t.

05:10:12.160 --> 05:10:20.320
And I can see that for any value of t, x over six and y over five will satisfy this equation

05:10:20.320 --> 05:10:27.840
simply because cosine squared plus sine squared equals one. This gives me the parameterization

05:10:28.560 --> 05:10:38.560
x equals six cosine of t, y equals five sine of t, which is a handy way to describe an ellipse.

05:10:41.840 --> 05:10:49.280
As a final example, let's describe a general circle of radius r and center hk.

05:10:50.160 --> 05:10:59.120
For any point x y on the circle, we know that the distance from that point x y to the center

05:10:59.120 --> 05:11:08.480
of the circle is equal to r. So using the distance formula, we know that the square root of x minus

05:11:08.720 --> 05:11:18.160
x minus h squared plus y minus k squared has to equal r. Squaring both sides,

05:11:18.160 --> 05:11:24.560
this gives us the equation for the circle in Cartesian coordinates. So for example,

05:11:25.280 --> 05:11:34.240
if our circle has radius five and has center at the point negative three, 17, then its equation

05:11:34.240 --> 05:11:43.840
would be x minus negative three, that's x plus three squared plus y minus 17 squared is equal to 25.

05:11:45.520 --> 05:11:52.400
One way to find the equation of a general circle in parametric equations is to start with the

05:11:52.400 --> 05:12:00.560
unit circle and work our way up. We know that the unit circle with radius one centered at the origin

05:12:00.640 --> 05:12:06.720
is given by the equation x equals cosine t and y equals sine t.

05:12:09.120 --> 05:12:13.760
If we want a circle of radius r centered around the origin instead,

05:12:15.120 --> 05:12:21.760
then we need to expand everything by a factor of r. So we multiply our x and y coordinates by r.

05:12:22.720 --> 05:12:32.560
If we now want the center to be at hk instead of at the origin, then we need to add h to all our x

05:12:32.560 --> 05:12:40.400
coordinates and add k to all our y coordinates. This gives us the general equation for a circle

05:12:41.120 --> 05:12:48.080
in parametric equations to match the Cartesian equation above. We can write our same example

05:12:48.720 --> 05:13:02.560
circle in parametric equations as x equals five cosine t minus three, y equals five sine t plus 17.

05:13:05.120 --> 05:13:10.400
In this video, we translated back and forth in between Cartesian equations

05:13:10.960 --> 05:13:17.120
and parametric equations with a special emphasis on the equations for circles.

05:13:18.240 --> 05:13:27.360
This video is about the difference quotient and the average rate of change.

05:13:29.120 --> 05:13:32.800
These are topics that are related to the concept of derivative in calculus.

05:13:34.160 --> 05:13:38.720
For a function y equals f of x, like the function who's graphed right here,

05:13:39.440 --> 05:13:46.880
a secant line is a line that stretches between two points on the graph of the function.

05:13:49.040 --> 05:13:56.880
I'm going to label this x value as a and this x value as b. So this point here on the graph is

05:13:56.880 --> 05:14:06.160
going to have an x value of a and a y value given by f of a. The second point will have x value b

05:14:06.160 --> 05:14:15.040
and y value f of b. Now the average rate of change for a function on the interval from a to b

05:14:15.760 --> 05:14:21.680
can be defined as the slope of the secant line

05:14:25.120 --> 05:14:26.480
between the two points,

05:14:28.480 --> 05:14:40.080
a f of a and b f of b. In symbols, that slope m is the rise over the run or the change in y

05:14:40.080 --> 05:14:49.120
over the change in x, which is the difference in y coordinates f of b minus f of a over the

05:14:49.120 --> 05:14:54.560
difference in x coordinates b minus a. So this is the average rate of change.

05:14:55.760 --> 05:15:01.920
To put this in context, if for example, f of x represents the height of a tree

05:15:02.080 --> 05:15:12.160
and x represents time in years, then f of b minus f of a represents a difference in height or the

05:15:12.160 --> 05:15:19.840
amount the tree grows. And b minus a represents a difference in in years. So a time period. So this

05:15:19.840 --> 05:15:24.880
average rate of change is the amount the tree grows in a certain time period. For example, if it grows

05:15:25.520 --> 05:15:32.800
10 inches in two years, that would be 10 inches per two years or five inches per year would be its

05:15:32.800 --> 05:15:38.560
average rate of change, its average rate of growth. Let's compute the average rate of change for the

05:15:38.560 --> 05:15:45.680
function f of x equals square root of x on the interval for one to four. So the average rate of

05:15:45.680 --> 05:15:55.680
change is f of four minus f of one over four minus one. Well, f of four is the square root of four

05:15:56.400 --> 05:16:03.520
of one square root of one. So that's going to be two minus one over three or one third.

05:16:05.360 --> 05:16:13.200
Instead of calling these two locations on the x axis, a and b, this time I'm going to call the

05:16:13.200 --> 05:16:23.360
first location just x and the second location x plus h. The idea is that h represents the horizontal

05:16:23.360 --> 05:16:31.840
distance between these two locations on the x axis. In this notation, if I want to label this

05:16:31.840 --> 05:16:39.520
point on the graph of y equals f of x, it'll have an x coordinate of x and a y coordinate of f of x.

05:16:39.520 --> 05:16:47.200
The second point will have an x coordinate of x plus h and a y coordinate of f of x plus h.

05:16:48.640 --> 05:16:55.680
A difference quotient is simply the average rate of change using this x x plus h notation.

05:16:56.800 --> 05:17:00.560
So a difference quotient represents the average rate of change

05:17:00.960 --> 05:17:14.560
of a function f of x on the interval from x to x plus h. Equivalently, the difference quotient

05:17:14.560 --> 05:17:23.200
represents the slope of the secant line for the graph of y equals f of x between the points

05:17:23.520 --> 05:17:34.640
with coordinates x f of x and x plus h f of x plus h. Let's work out a formula for the difference

05:17:34.640 --> 05:17:40.960
quotient. Remember that the formula for the average rate of change could be written as f of b

05:17:41.520 --> 05:17:48.880
minus f of a over b minus a, where a and b are the two locations on the x axis.

05:17:48.880 --> 05:17:56.800
But now I'm calling instead of a I'm using x instead of b I'm using x plus h. So I can rewrite

05:17:56.800 --> 05:18:05.760
this average rate of change as f of x plus h minus f of x over x plus h minus x.

05:18:07.120 --> 05:18:14.960
That simplifies a little bit on the denominator. Because x plus h minus x, I can cancel the x's

05:18:15.520 --> 05:18:22.320
and I get the difference quotient formula f of x plus h minus f of x over h.

05:18:24.400 --> 05:18:29.360
The quantity h on this denominator looks like a single entity, but it still represents

05:18:29.360 --> 05:18:36.800
a difference in x values. Let's find and simplify the difference quotient for this function given.

05:18:38.000 --> 05:18:41.120
First, I'll write down the general formula for the difference quotient.

05:18:41.360 --> 05:18:50.480
That's f of x plus h minus f of x over h. I'm going to compute f of x plus h first,

05:18:51.040 --> 05:18:57.200
I do this by shoving in x plus h everywhere I see an x in the formula for the function.

05:18:58.560 --> 05:19:07.760
So that's going to give me two times x plus h squared minus x plus h plus three.

05:19:07.760 --> 05:19:13.520
Notice how I use parentheses here. That's important because I need to make sure

05:19:13.520 --> 05:19:19.520
I shove in the entire x plus h for x. So the entire x plus h needs to be subtracted,

05:19:19.520 --> 05:19:22.560
not just the x part. So the parentheses are mandatory.

05:19:23.920 --> 05:19:30.000
Similarly, the parentheses here signal that the entire x plus h is squared as it needs to be.

05:19:30.480 --> 05:19:38.320
I'm going to go ahead and simplify a bit right now. I can multiply out the x plus h squared.

05:19:39.040 --> 05:19:47.440
I can go ahead and distribute the negative sign. So if I multiply out, I'm going to get x squared

05:19:47.440 --> 05:19:57.280
plus xh plus hx plus h squared. Now I can distribute the two to get two x squared plus

05:19:57.760 --> 05:20:06.160
two xh plus two hx plus two h squared minus x minus h plus three. These two terms are actually the

05:20:06.160 --> 05:20:15.600
same. I can add them up to get four xh. And I think that's as simple as I can get that part.

05:20:16.640 --> 05:20:21.920
Now I'm going to write out f of x plus h minus f of x. So that's going to be

05:20:22.640 --> 05:20:30.880
this thing right here minus f of x. Again, I need to put the f of x formula in parentheses to make

05:20:30.880 --> 05:20:37.440
sure I subtract the whole thing. I'll distribute the negative. And now I notice that a bunch of

05:20:37.440 --> 05:20:43.680
things cancel out. So the two x squared and the minus two x squared add to zero, the minus x and

05:20:43.680 --> 05:20:54.800
the x add to zero, and the three and the minus three add to zero. So I'm left with four xh plus

05:20:54.800 --> 05:21:04.240
two h squared minus h. Finally, I'll write out the whole difference quotient by dividing everything

05:21:04.240 --> 05:21:10.640
by h. I can simplify this further because notice that there's an h in every single term of the

05:21:10.640 --> 05:21:18.640
numerator. If I factor out this h, h times four x plus two h minus one divided by h,

05:21:19.280 --> 05:21:25.840
these two h's cancel. And I'm left with a difference quotient of four x plus two h minus one.

05:21:27.440 --> 05:21:32.240
This difference quotient will become important in calculus. When we calculate a difference quotient

05:21:32.240 --> 05:21:37.120
for smaller and smaller values of h, eventually letting h go to zero and ending up with an

05:21:37.120 --> 05:21:43.120
expression that has no h is in it and represents the derivative or slope of the function itself.

05:21:44.560 --> 05:21:51.920
In this video, we use the formula f of b minus f of a over b minus a to calculate an average rate

05:21:51.920 --> 05:22:00.160
of change and the related formula f of x plus h minus f of x over h to calculate and simplify a

05:22:00.160 --> 05:22:09.200
difference quotient.
