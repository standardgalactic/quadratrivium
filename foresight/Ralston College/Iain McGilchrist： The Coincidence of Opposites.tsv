0	2000	You
30640	36480	Thank you everyone. I'm sorry a little trouble getting my my video to stop there. I'm not yet
36480	42160	the master of the zoom medium. Though you'd think after a year and a half of COVID we would all be
42160	50080	great experts. It's a it's a huge pleasure today to welcome you all to this live lecture with Dr. Ian
50080	54320	McGillchrist. I'm Stephen Blackwood. I'm the president of Ralston College, a new institution of
54320	60960	higher education. I'm streaming live from the beautiful city of Savannah in the state of Georgia
60960	66080	in the United States. I welcome you all here. I know we have a wide range of time zones. So it's
66080	72640	good morning, good afternoon or good evening depending on where you are. I know that Dr. Ian
72640	77840	McGillchrist needs little introduction. We're honored to have him as a visitor of the college.
77920	84480	He is a psychiatrist, a literary scholar, a philosopher in the true sense of the term a
84480	90400	polymath, a man who has learned about many different disciplines and fields of knowledge
91920	97920	in very deep and interconnected ways. And in fact, that interconnection is one of the persistent
97920	104800	themes of his work that I think is sure to come out today. Dr. McGillchrist has written a new book
104800	113440	which is about to be published. It's a landmark work or going to be. It's a very substantial
114000	121200	two volume book called The Matter with Things. And the lecture today is going to be a,
122240	129120	as it were, an introduction to at least some of the themes that are sketched or not sketched,
129120	135680	but argued at length in that book. His title today is called The Coincidence of Opposites.
135680	138960	And those of you who've had the chance perhaps to study philosophy will know that this is an
138960	146000	ancient theme going back to the earliest moments of recorded human thinking. And I know that we're
146000	152080	all looking forward to see just how Dr. McGillchrist introduces this to us. I wanted to note that he
152080	157600	has shared with us a couple of pages of preliminary reading. I know that was shared with all of you
157600	164560	in advance, but it's on our website at www.rollston.ac on the webpage for this event. If you haven't
164560	170160	had a chance to read that, you can do so afterwards. All right. The format today will be that Dr.
170160	175200	McGillchrist, to whom I'll turn things over momentarily, is going to give us a lecture
175200	180640	of somewhere around an hour or thereabouts. And then we're going to open things up for a
180640	186480	conversation and audience questions. So please feel free to shoot as many questions as you like
186480	191440	through the chat. Dr. McGillchrist and I will do our best to get through as many of them as we can,
191440	198160	and to make this as conversational and richly participatory as we can.
198160	203360	Anyway, with that said, Dr. McGillchrist, oh, I need to say one more thing, and that is that
204240	211680	you'll see that Dr. McGillchrist's screen is a little low resolution. Well, I received an email
211680	217360	from him just a couple of hours ago saying that on the Isle of Skye off the northwest coast of
217360	222960	Scotland, where he lives on the Talisker Bay, some of you may know the whiskey Talisker,
222960	228640	if you don't, I encourage you to sample it, that there is a torrential rainstorm currently
228640	235120	underway, a violent bit of weather. And because his internet capabilities are mediated by a
235120	239600	satellite, it is affected by the weather. We're independently recording this lecture
241120	247520	in Ian's office there in both video and audio, so we anticipate having a high level of
248720	254400	production in what we can subsequently share as a podcast and on YouTube. But I must,
255520	260800	Dr. McGillchrist and I both ask for your patience with respect to the what could be some interruptions
260800	267440	today. Stick with us. I know it will be worthwhile. And perhaps there's something good
267440	274640	in being reminded about the insurmountable realities of nature that even our confident
274640	281760	technology cannot ultimately, reliably always tame. Anyway, with that introduction, Ian,
281760	284800	what a great pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us today.
285520	290160	Oh, thank you so much, Stephen. And it's been a great honor to be
291440	297200	accepted as a visitor of Rawson College. And I wish Rawson College and yourself
297200	304080	every conceivable success as it flourishes and goes forward. So thank you for inviting me along
304160	314240	here tonight. As you hear, I have a rather oppositional relationship with technology,
314240	322080	and usually it finds ways of frustrating me. And tonight it's doing so mediated by a good old storm.
322640	332080	So I'll do my best. Now as Stephen was mentioning, I've been spending the last
332080	337840	10, 12 years writing a book called The Matter with Things, which is a pun, as you can possibly
337840	346800	imagine, on several levels. And one of the things that we, in my view, get wrong is that we fail to
346800	354560	understand anymore that things and their opposites are not as irreconcilable and as far apart from
354560	360400	one another as they might seem. That may be a product of a number of things, the history of
360400	366720	philosophy, but it's imaged in our love of straight lines. So the two ends of a straight line, you
366720	372800	think as far as you project them in one direction, they get further and further away from the end
372800	379360	of the line in the opposite, as we call it, direction. Since my teens, I've not thought that
379360	385920	this was actually the case, and that opposites tended eventually to coincide. Anyway, I'll have
385920	394800	some reflections to say about this from a number of viewpoints, and a few reflections on the current
395520	405680	state of things in our society, where I believe if we could grasp the idea that opposites do not have
406400	416960	this linearly irreconcilable relationship, we might produce a happier world and a better
416960	423200	society. What we call opposites are often facets of one and the same thing. So I'm going to talk
423200	429200	about this from a number of angles, and I wanted to start with three quotations, which are actually
429200	437760	also on the little piece that I shared with you earlier, which relates a most extraordinary
438880	447040	Iroquois legend, the legend of the Onondaga people, and I do urge you to read it. It was brought to
447040	453120	my attention by an anthropologist who commented on the extraordinary number of parallels between
453120	460720	it and the thesis of the master and his emissary, and I will refer to it very briefly. But first of
460720	468960	all, I want to mention three sayings. The first is from a philosopher, the second from a physicist,
468960	474160	and the third from a poet, and I find myself in my writing often drawing these three strands
474160	482320	together incidentally. From C. S. Perse, the American pragmatist philosopher,
483520	492160	a thing without oppositions, ipso facto does not exist. Existence lies in opposition.
494000	496720	Existence lies in opposition.
497440	504800	Then from Niels Bohr, it is the hallmark of any deep truth that its negation is also a deep truth.
504800	513680	So that not only things have this contrary constitution, as Perse was pointing out, but
513680	523600	that the things that we see as opposites often are not opposites at a deep level. There are many
523600	531040	superficial truths that are obviously mutually exclusive. Either I had milk in my coffee at
531040	537680	breakfast time or I didn't, and Bohr was very willing to accept that, but he saw more and more
537680	542480	that the deeper you went into the structure of reality, the more it was the case that a thing
542480	551840	and its opposite could be true at the same time. And the third is from the German romantic
551840	558880	poet Friedrich HÃ¶llerlin. The heart's wave would never have risen up so beautifully in its
558880	566880	cloud of spray and become spirit, were it not for the grim old cliff of destiny standing in its way.
568400	574240	Another theme that's very important in my work is that of the creative nature of resistance.
574240	580080	In fact, nothing can be created. Nothing can come into being without resistance.
582480	592640	As you know, if you know anything about my work, I have been involved for 30 years or more
592640	599840	in researching differences between the two brain hemispheres. And these two brain hemispheres
599840	608480	illustrate something rather important that they work together but apart. They co-operate by opposing
608480	615360	one another. And that is actually very much like the way nature in general works. We've
615360	622080	brought into a myth that actually all the history of nature is one of competition.
622640	627520	But it's as much or more, I would argue, and many biologists would argue,
628240	636320	it's more a history of co-operation. And the coming together of competition and co-operation
636320	645280	produces what I call collaboration. And the two hemispheres need to inhibit one another,
645280	650800	to inform one another. They need to stand back and away from one another and at times to work
650800	658160	in unison. They have an interesting relationship which is oppositional but by no means contradictory.
659440	664000	And that is really beautifully brought out in the Iroquois legend of these two brothers that
664000	671760	create the world. And they have this difference of stance. But one knows more than the other and
671760	679120	needs to keep the other one under its aegis, under its watchful eye. And that is, as I argued in the
679120	683680	book The Master and His Emissary, the relationship between the right and the left hemisphere. So
683680	688880	the right hemisphere understands and sees things that the left hemisphere doesn't. And that for
688880	695040	that reason, the left hemisphere should always be in service to the right hemisphere. It makes
695040	706480	a very good servant but a very poor master. Everything that exists could be thought of as
706480	713920	a form of energy. After all, one of the most famous equations in the world, E equals mc2,
713920	721280	tells us that energy and mass are inter-convertible. Energy is always characterized by the coming
721280	727760	together of apparent opposites. Apparent because this is how we've conceived things left hemisphere
727760	735040	fashion. As in the positive and negative poles of electricity, the north and south poles of the
735040	743280	magnet, or in a quite different sense, the merging of male and female gametes in the origin of new
743280	748880	life. And interestingly, if you see cell division under a microscope, it looks extraordinary like
748880	756720	the work of a magnet with iron filings. There are famous illustrations of this and it's been
756720	765760	commented on since the middle of the 19th century. The best known expression of the idea of complementary
765760	775920	opposites is that of the Taijitu symbol, commonly known as the yin yang symbol. And yin yang is
775920	784240	probably the most sophisticated expression of an idea that is existent in cultures all over the world.
785760	792400	From all parts of the world that I know through anthropology, that is a myth of
792400	799840	two opposite forces that need one another. And the fact that it's been somewhat vulgarized is not a
800800	806000	any argument against it any more than the fact that there are mistaken followers of a religion
806000	812400	vitiates the importance of that religion. But we do live a known world in which we want to
813680	821280	try and simplify. And this business of the coming together of opposites frustrates that wish to be
822080	830000	simple. You often hear people of a spiritual bent saying, all is one. And it sounds wonderful,
830000	838480	doesn't it? It sounds so calming. It sounds so deep. All is one. And it's true. But so is it that
838480	848160	all is many. And now what? Neither of these truths is a lesser truth than the other. Indeed,
848160	856000	one of the ways of looking at the whole creative cosmos is of the continuing unfolding, the endless
856000	865280	unfolding of individuation out of union, not so as to thunder or fragment, but so as to enrich
865840	875280	that whole. So I would say the very drive of the cosmos is about distinction without separation.
875280	885440	Gerta said, and Gerta, to me, is one of the all time greatest minds, indeed a true polymath,
886000	896720	a poet, a philosopher, a playwright, a statesman, a scientist, a man of enormous wisdom. And what
896720	904720	he said was dividing the united, uniting the divided is the very life of nature. This is
904720	911520	the eternal sisterly and deasterly, the eternal coalescence and separation, the inhalation and
911520	917840	exhalation of the world in which we live, and where our existence is woven, a very beautiful
917840	924480	and important word that woven about the coming together of different threads in the tapestry or
924480	934000	in the net to create something new. And we think of this idea as essentially one that is
934720	942080	eastern in origin. But as I've just pointed out, it's there in the western tradition,
942080	947120	even Gerta at the time of the Enlightenment was saying it. And in the earliest and in my view
947120	953280	greatest of all the Greek philosophers, Heraclitus, he said many things that are relevant, but I just
953280	960240	want to mention two. They do not understand, he said, how a thing agrees at variance with itself.
961120	967440	It is an attunement turning back on itself, like that of the bow and the liar.
968480	976720	The word he used there is harmonia, the origin of our concept of harmony. And the idea of harmony,
976720	982400	of course, is not that everything is the same, but that everything within the harmony is different,
983040	988240	but is brought into a fruitful union with all the other parts of the harmony.
989200	996160	And the image of the bow and the liar are simple and very powerful. The ends of a
996160	1003280	liar string are pulled apart. Effort is put into torturing that string. And you might think,
1003280	1009360	why pull in opposite directions? Why not just simplify and not pull at all? But then the
1009360	1015840	string goes slack. It's no longer taught. And there is no note that comes forth from the
1015840	1022800	string of the liar. There is no arrow that comes forth from the string of the bow. Its existence
1022800	1032000	depends on exactly this balance of pulling in opposite directions. Harmony in the Greek of
1032000	1038400	Heraclitus had three principal meanings. One was the fitting together of surfaces.
1039440	1045760	As we say, surfaces that are true to one another, or as we say, marry. If you're a carpenter,
1046080	1054720	you talk about a true fit, or a surfaces marrying. The second is the reconciling of warring parties.
1054720	1060880	So Heraclitus famously said that war is the father of all things, but he could have said that
1060880	1067600	peace is the queen of all things, because both this war and peace need to be harmonized.
1068480	1073040	And it's in its most common, modern meaning, the accord of musical strings.
1073760	1080480	The second saying of Heraclitus I'd like to advert to is another one, I think probably the
1080480	1089360	richest and the most difficult to understand. And it begins with the word salipsis, or in his
1089840	1100800	or in his Ionic Greek, Syllapsius. But anyway, we would say salipsis. Graspings, it's translated,
1101760	1110000	hole and not holes, convergent divergent, consonant dissonant, from all things one
1110000	1116800	and from one things all. Now the Greek word salipsis here translated grasping seems again
1117600	1124720	to suggest several ideas, something grasped, perhaps suggesting sudden comprehension,
1125520	1132320	something that brings elements together, and fertility. Aristotle uses the word to mean the
1132320	1140240	sexual generation of life, coming together, as I mentioned earlier, of the male and female gametes.
1141200	1147520	It's hard to overestimate the richness of this fragment, it says so many things at once, that
1147520	1154000	a deep understanding of the nature of reality comes in glimpses, or grasping, moments of insight,
1155120	1161200	that in that insight, which by the way is very robustly associated with the right cerebral
1161200	1169120	hemisphere, particularly with the right superior temporal area, that in those moments of insight,
1169280	1176800	all is neither simply single nor simply manifold, neither simply whole nor simply not whole,
1176800	1183600	neither simply like nor simply unlike, each thing working with and by the same token working against
1183600	1189360	the others, that the one and the many bring one another forth into being, together generating
1189360	1196080	the reality that has this structure at its core. And that despite, or in light of all this perhaps
1196080	1204240	because of the nature of this multiplicity, all is held together in a salipsis, the only word here,
1204240	1211040	not to be paired with its antithesis. And the whole saying is itself, of course, a salipsis,
1211040	1217440	a gathering, which in its fertility births a salipsis, a moment of dawning insight in us.
1218400	1225280	So to move right forward from the sixth century BC, to the last hundred years,
1225280	1233360	we've discovered that not only can small elements in matter manifest either as a wave,
1233360	1240800	or as a particle that seem contrary types of element, but they can manifest as waves and
1240880	1251360	particles simultaneously. And here again is a very important idea that we don't have to see one
1251360	1256880	and then the other, but see them nested within one another. Thus we're used to thinking of the
1256880	1264320	individual and the general, the temporal and the eternal, the embodied and the disembodied as
1264320	1272160	exclusive pairings. But it was possibly Goethe's greatest insight to see that they're present
1272160	1279040	simultaneously in one another. They're found not by turning one's back on the supposed opposite,
1279040	1286800	but by going more deeply into it. Thus the general is found in the individual, the eternal in the
1286880	1295760	temporal, the spiritual in the embodied. This tension is creative, generative. Although a
1295760	1300560	thing and its opposite or a thing and its negative are customarily thought of as separate warring
1300560	1307760	entities, they are, I argue, mutually sustaining, inseparable and intertwined. You cannot have
1307760	1314880	heat without cold or brightness without darkness. We can't keep the mountains, as Alan Watts put
1314880	1323280	it, and get rid of the valleys. And we have one such enigma at the very core of our being,
1323280	1328160	the corpus callosum, the body of fibers that connects the two hemispheres at their base.
1328880	1335920	In connecting, it separates. In separating, it connects. And as if being intuitively aware of
1335920	1342000	this in the Upanishads, we read, in the space within the heart lies the controller of all.
1342640	1348240	He is the bridge that serves as the boundary to keep the different worlds apart.
1349200	1351760	An interesting gloss on the idea of a bridge.
1354560	1361360	Quite a homely example of that, of course, is the eardrum. The eardrum separates one part of
1361360	1367760	the ear from another. But without it, we couldn't hear sound at all. It's actually caused by the
1367760	1375360	vibrations, the reverberations, the to and fro movement of this separative element.
1377440	1385280	Often inhibition releases and creates. Often delimitation is what makes a thing come into
1385280	1392720	being. Indeed, that is what defines anything. And friction is an interesting example of something
1392720	1399680	that is, in a way, in opposition to movement. But in its absence, movement becomes impossible.
1400880	1405680	It's the very constraint, isn't it, on movement, friction. But it's also what makes movement
1405680	1412480	possible at all. It's true in its excess, we're immobilized, yet so we are in its absence. There's
1412480	1419280	nothing to push against. Resistance can put the brakes on motion or cause motion. It can prevent
1419280	1425600	or cause change. It prevents us with an obstacle and thereby forces us to shift our point of view.
1425600	1431840	It helps us shift the plane of focus so that we see something new. In itself, resistance
1431840	1436880	is neither necessarily good nor necessarily bad. It's just necessary.
1439200	1446960	To make a good apple pie, you don't need bland apples. You need nice tart apples and very good
1446960	1455120	sweet honey. William Blake wrote, without contraries is no progression. Attraction and repulsion,
1455760	1463440	reason and energy, love and hate are necessary to human existence. And we shouldn't try to get
1463440	1468800	round this by saying, well, yes, actually, but there's a way of blending them so that we don't
1468800	1475120	have to deal with that. The philosopher Jacob Needleman wrote, stay with the contradiction.
1475120	1480480	If you stay, you will see that there's always something more than two opposing truths. The
1480480	1486720	whole truth always includes a third part, which is the reconciliation. Those of you who are familiar
1486720	1494640	with the philosophy of Hegel will know the concept of Aufhebern, that coming together of two things
1494640	1502080	that appear to be opposite into a fruitful new union. But it's not just Hegel, one of my favorite
1502080	1508240	philosophers, and I believe one of the greatest of the last 100 years is Alfred North Whitehead,
1508240	1516400	again, a great philosopher, mathematician and scientist. To have seen it from one side only
1516400	1524080	is not to have seen it. He also said, by the way, that there are no whole truths, only half
1524080	1530960	truths, is taking the half truths for whole truths that plays the devil. My word, I wish politicians
1531600	1537440	and their over-vocal spokesman on the internet remembered that fact.
1539360	1546640	Opposites, please remember this, genuinely coincide while remaining opposites.
1547760	1552320	Some philosophies tend to collapse into the monism that opposites are identical.
1553040	1559040	Others into the dualism that opposites remain irreconcilable and are merely at most juxtaposed.
1559600	1566000	The important perception is that opposites not only co-indexist, but give rise to and fulfill
1566000	1574800	one another. As Nils Bohr said, Contraria sunt complementa. He took that as his
1574800	1581040	family motto when he was ennobled by the Danish government. Contraries fulfill one another. And
1581040	1586000	they're conjoined, like the poles of a magnet, who can't have one without the other, but without
1586000	1592880	there being any intervening boundary. They nonetheless remain distinct as opposites. This
1592880	1598240	idea of complementarity is foundational in nature. It's foundational certainly in
1598240	1604000	everything in modern physics. I would say in morality and I would say in spirituality.
1605440	1611840	So, for example, to turn one's back on the parts, the work that the left hemisphere brings forward
1611840	1619920	for us, and except only the whole, the work that the right hemisphere gives us, is not to get back
1619920	1626560	to wholeness, because the whole is never an annihilation, but rather a subsumption of the
1626560	1633920	parts. The true whole exists precisely in this relationship, the tension between parts and an
1633920	1646240	apparent whole. Moreover, morally speaking, every angel has his devil. And I wish I could show you,
1646880	1654720	but for copyright reasons, I don't dare show you, a wonderful image by MC Escher called Circle Limit 4,
1656320	1660640	often called Angels and Devils. If you look that up, that up, perhaps later, I hope,
1661360	1665280	you will see why it is a particularly beautiful illustration of what I'm talking about.
1666880	1672960	But you know, in our society we are beset, aren't we, by what we call paradoxes. We pursue happiness
1672960	1679680	and become measurably less happy over time. We privilege autonomy and end up bound by rules
1679680	1684640	to which we never assented and more spied on than any people since the beginning of time.
1685360	1690400	We pursue leisure through technology and discover that the average working day is longer than
1690400	1697680	ever and that we have less time than we had before. The means to our ends are ever more available,
1697680	1702720	while we have less sense of what our end should be or whether there's purpose in anything at all.
1703920	1709120	Economists carefully model and monitor the financial markets in order to avoid any future
1709120	1716240	crash. They promptly crash. We are so eager that all scientific research results in positive findings
1716240	1721440	that has become progressively less adventurous and more predictable and therefore discovers less
1721440	1727280	and less that is a truly significant advance in scientific thinking. We grossly misconceive the
1727280	1734480	nature of study in the humanities as utilitarian in order to get value for money and thus render it
1734480	1741600	pointless and in this form certainly a waste of resource. We improve education by dictating
1741600	1747440	curricula and focusing on exam results to the point where free thinking, arguably an overarching
1747440	1754400	goal of true education, is discouraged. In our universities many students are in any case so
1754400	1759520	frightened that the truth might turn out not to conform to their theoretical model that they
1759520	1764800	demand to be protected from discussions that threaten to examine the model critically
1764800	1770080	and their teachers who should know better in a serious dereliction of duty collude.
1771600	1777760	We over sanitize and cause vulnerability to infection. We overuse antibiotics leading to
1777760	1786400	super bacteria that no antibiotic can kill. We make drugs illegal to protect society and while
1786400	1792640	failing comprehensively to control the use of drugs we create a fertile field for crime. We
1792640	1798400	protect children in such a way that they cannot cope with let alone relish uncertainty or risk
1798400	1803600	and are rendered vulnerable. The left hemisphere's motivation is control
1803600	1809600	and its means of achieving it alarmingly linear as though it could see only one of the arrows
1809600	1816960	in a vastly complex network of recursive interactions at any one time which is all it can.
1820960	1824800	I want to mention something called hormesis it's a term from chemistry
1824800	1830000	and what it refers to is a familiar phenomenon which a very small amount of something may have
1830000	1838240	highly beneficial effects but a larger amount may kill you. Some scientists were rather puzzled
1838880	1843760	when they were trying to account for what happened in an experimental environment called
1843760	1851920	biosphere 2 which is a very large covered sheltered environment in which plants and trees are given
1851920	1857760	what are seen as an optimal environment in which to flourish and it was discovered that trees
1858800	1865520	rarely reached maturity before they fell over. Why was this? Well it turns out that actually being
1865520	1873200	subject to stressful winds is extremely important for the growth and survival of a tree. It produces
1873200	1880400	something called stress wood which is the core strength of it. As so often Nietzsche got there
1880400	1887360	a long time before the 21st century scientists examined the lives he said of the best and most
1887360	1892320	fruitful people and peoples and asked yourself whether a tree which is supposed to grow to a
1892320	1899760	proud height could do without bad weather and storms. Whether misfortune and external resistance
1899760	1906880	whether any kinds of hatred jealousy stubbornness mistrust hardness greed and violence do not belong
1906880	1913440	to the favorable conditions without which any great growth even of virtue is scarcely possible.
1914480	1923040	And there are many examples in medicine digitalis atropine arsenic will be familiar to doctors and
1923040	1932640	to some patients. Even radiation in small amounts can suppress tumors relative to creatures who are
1932880	1939920	raised in an environment in highly free of radiation and a deadly poison called dioxin
1939920	1948000	in very small amounts can heal tumors. I am not by any means please understand me excusing
1948000	1954080	in any sense the pollution of our environment my whole point is that these are highly toxic
1954080	1961520	but that in very small amounts they may be beneficial. Changing of context completely changes
1961520	1967200	what can be said to be true so that something can come to mean its opposite. There are many
1967840	1975360	profound examples of this from religious text and from poetry but one I rather like just because
1975360	1982400	it's so every day is the sizes of cereal packets you know I think in America there are four sizes
1982400	1988720	of cereal packets there's one called jumbo which means very large then there's one called economy
1988720	1997040	which means large then there's one called family which means medium then finally there's one called
1997040	2006160	large which means small. Things change depending on the context which is why taking a statement
2006160	2010640	that anyone says out of the context without everything else that said or even without the
2010640	2016960	tone of voice which may betray a completely different meaning is so treacherous. From any
2016960	2025120	one standpoint also only a part of the picture is possible and I say that not because as it where
2025120	2029920	we might be able to get around this if we had some other way of doing things intrinsically
2029920	2037680	it is possible only to take in one part of a reality at a time and what I conceive objectivity
2037680	2043840	to be is not to affect some cast of mind in which there is nothing human that would be very strange
2044480	2050960	way of looking at things that wouldn't be particularly rich in its ability to reveal
2050960	2056800	the nature of the thing but to instead see as many points of view on something as you possibly can
2058880	2064880	and that's part of what Whitehead meant talking about half truths and you are needing the other
2064880	2071360	half of the truth to see it from one side only is not to have seen it and in fact in Japanese there's
2072240	2079440	a term Tambankan for a person who only sees one side and what it means is somebody who carries
2079440	2084240	a board on their shoulder so that they only see with one half of their field of vision.
2085760	2091360	Also another Japanese image comes to mind that I love one of the greatest of all the Zen gardens
2091360	2098240	Riyanji has I think 15 rocks in it but it is so constructed that there is no place in the garden
2098240	2103600	from which you can see all of the rocks the most you can see at any one point would be 14
2105360	2111440	and in our world I'm afraid we neglect often the dark side everything has its dark side
2112560	2119040	that is really a central message to be taken home there is nothing so good that it cannot
2120720	2126320	have negative consequences and indeed there is nothing so bad that it cannot
2127120	2134480	occasionally give rise to good. Neglecting this unfortunately leads to extremism as a psychiatrist
2134480	2138480	one of the hardest things to deal with is a person who believes they should be
2140160	2146480	perfect and therefore in denial about their imperfections these people become very stressed
2146480	2152720	anxious and unhappy and actually spread anxiety and unhappiness around them in their families
2152720	2157840	trying to control everything for good instead of realizing that actually they can't do that
2157840	2164080	and that they would be better to exercise a wise ability to move flexibly with the flow.
2165760	2176480	I've talked a bit about a straight line the German great highly eccentric painter and architect
2176480	2184160	actually sorry I did him a well not an injustice but I made an error there calling him German he
2184160	2191680	was in fact an Austrian Friedensreich Hundertwasser wrote in 1953 I realized that the straight line
2191680	2197840	leads to the downfall of mankind but the straight line has become an absolute tyranny the straight
2197840	2202880	line is something cowardly drawn with a rule without thought or feeling it is a line which
2202880	2210160	does not exist in nature and that line is the rotten foundation of our doomed civilization
2210160	2216320	the straight line is atheistic and immoral it is the only sterile line the only line which
2216320	2222800	does not suit man as the image of god the straight line is the forbidden fruit the straight line is
2222800	2229680	the curse of our civilization any design undertaken with the straight line will be stillborn today
2229760	2235680	we are witnessing the triumph of rationalist know-how and yet at the same time we find ourselves
2235680	2243360	confronted with emptiness an aesthetic void a desert of uniformity criminal sterility loss
2243360	2251360	of creative power even creativity is prefabricated we have become impotent we are no longer able
2251360	2263680	to create that is our real illiteracy well he certainly put it like it is and I think
2263680	2269280	it's a very fine piece of writing it's not his only words on this topic but I like to put this
2269280	2274240	together with something communicated to me personally by a member of the Swiss parliament
2274240	2281920	Lukas Fiertz who is a founding member of the Green Party in Switzerland who recalled a meeting
2281920	2289360	as a boy with his neighbor Carl Gustav Jung and in the course of conversation Jung told us says
2290080	2297280	Lukas Fiertz about his encounter with a Pueblo chief whose name was Mountain Lake the chief
2297280	2304800	told him that the white man was doomed when asked why the chief took both hands before his eyes and
2304800	2311040	Jung imitating the gesture moved the outstretched index fingers convergingly towards one point
2311040	2318000	before him saying because the white man looks only at one point excluding all other aspects
2319440	2325680	many years later dr. Fiertz who's a physician recalls that a significant adversary of the
2325760	2330960	Green Party movement was a successful industrialist and self-made billionaire
2332560	2338480	I asked him what in his view was the reason for his incredible entrepreneurial and political
2338480	2345280	success he took both hands before his eyes and moved the outstretched index fingers convergingly
2345280	2352160	towards one point before him saying because I am able to concentrate on only one point excluding
2352160	2359360	all other aspects I remember that I had to swallow hard two or three times so as not to say anything
2362640	2368560	so some reflections on this perfect linearity and the structure of reality
2371600	2378400	William Blake thought that there even must be sorrow in heaven if there was to be joy
2379360	2382880	and in a well-known poem he wrote it is right that it should be so
2383440	2391040	man was made for joy and woe joy and woe are woven fine a clothing for the soul divine
2391760	2397120	under every grief and pine runs a joy with silken twine
2397120	2408000	perfection can constitute a flaw in traditional chinese houses the last three
2408000	2413680	tiles are always left off the roof because the saying is even heaven is not perfect
2414800	2420160	and in oriental rug making there is something called the imperfect stitch which is deliberately
2421120	2430000	lacking my first book against criticism was in a way a description of a strange phenomenon
2430000	2435840	why it is that when you start taking apart the qualities of analyzing the greatness of
2435840	2442640	a great literary figure you end up with a handful of things that are in themselves imperfections
2442640	2447360	and yet they put them together they do not in any way account for the greatness of the individual
2448160	2451200	uh i wrote about three of them in that book in particular
2452240	2458800	one the essayist and general philosopher and thinker sam johnson then the novelist lauren
2458800	2468960	stern and then the poet william wordsworth in physics we again have both a combination
2469520	2474320	of order with disorder and it wouldn't be good to have just one without the other
2475200	2482800	as david oliver says a physicist nature is neither inevitably random nor completely lawful
2482800	2490960	and predictable quantum spontaneity is only one half the story the other half is the regularity
2491920	2498560	and that what's often called the edge of chaos is terribly important existence coexistence of
2498560	2506080	order with disorder the critic and poet william empson wrote extremely often in dealing with
2506080	2512320	the world one arrives at two ideas or ways of dealing with things which both work and are needed
2512320	2518320	but which entirely contradict one another and we all experienced this don't be at every level
2518320	2525440	from the most innocently trivial uh or least trivial seeming to the most sublime we need
2525440	2534320	universality and particularity precision and flexibility restriction and openness freedom
2534320	2544320	and constraint simultaneously everything flows from the pairing we as we say lose ourselves
2544320	2552560	and consequently find ourselves in music dance or contemplation of a beautiful painting or landscape
2556240	2561360	there is an innocence the other side of experience and knowledge the other side of
2561360	2568640	knowing a wisdom the other side of folly which is not really its opposite the only simplicity
2568640	2574960	for which i would give a straw said that rather down to earth jurist oliver wendell holmes is
2574960	2582000	that which is on the other side of the complex not that which has never divided and joseph
2582000	2588880	camber writes i think there are three states of being one is the innocent expression of nature
2589600	2596080	another is when you pause analyze think about it then having analyzed there comes a state in
2596080	2603280	which you're able to live as nature again but with more competence more control more flexibility
2603280	2609280	that to me summarizes the proper relationship between the right and the left hemisphere the right
2609280	2616960	seeing the initial hole the left uh taking it apart in certain ways but crucially not ending
2616960	2624560	there but giving it back to the right hemisphere that can understand it now in an enriched unfolded
2624560	2633600	hole according to jung the grand plan on which the unconscious life of the psyche is constructed is so
2634320	2641120	inaccessible to our understanding that we can never know what evil way not evil may not be necessary
2641120	2647200	in order to produce good by what he called enantiadromia which basically means the tendency of
2647200	2655120	things to change into their opposites and what good may very possibly lead to evil a very striking
2655120	2663920	example from the natural sphere is the concept of a keystone keystone species in yellowstone park
2664960	2676240	the wolves were more or less eliminated in the 1930s the uh ecosphere as we now say deteriorated
2676800	2683600	the number of elk dwindled the number of beaver dwindled the number of willow trees dwindled
2684240	2690480	and then it was decided that actually the wolves played a very important part and they were
2690480	2695760	reintroduced and since they were reintroduced there are more elk there are more beavers and there are
2695760	2701360	more willows it sounds paradoxical but the thing is that the presence of the predator keeps the
2701360	2708400	elk's moving so they don't overgraze and destroy the landscape they move and flourish and because
2708480	2714240	the the trees flourish and they're no longer eaten up by the elk the beavers which need the trees
2714240	2720320	come back and flourish and so on and there are many many examples of this in nature where what
2720320	2731840	looks like the evil predator is in fact the key to life so instead of a um a linear model I would
2731840	2739920	prefer one of circularity or to modify that of a spiral the circle simply comes back to the same
2739920	2746800	place and is static a spiral is constantly moving and changing and as you come back around a loop
2746800	2752480	of the spiral you seem to be at the same place you were before but you're not actually you're
2752480	2757920	above it and you see what it was you thought you knew when you were there before but you don't
2757920	2763200	yet anticipate what you will know when you go on yet another loop of the spiral and come back to the
2763760	2769600	cognate point again on a higher loop and what I particularly like about the spiral is images
2769600	2776080	when you look down its axis it images the circularity but when you look at it from the side it images
2776080	2784800	the linearity. Empedocles who was another great uh pre-socratic philosopher thought there were two
2784800	2791680	opposing and equal forces that gave rise to everything love phylotes that is and strife
2791680	2799280	naikot in the presence of love only or strife only nothing could exist these forces for union and for
2799280	2804720	division according to empedocles are present in the very stuff of all things not just in their
2804720	2813200	ultimate origin and they're imaged as a circle not just as a straight line the idea of complementarity
2815040	2821840	coming back to the parts and and the whole again recognizes the nature of the earth's true essence
2822720	2829680	this was something particularly well expressed by the scientist and philosopher shelling
2830320	2836720	who I have come more and more greatly to honor and admire early 19th late 18th early 19th
2836720	2842320	German philosophy he says this about the relationship between the one and the many between
2842320	2848000	the unique and the general which is actually another chapter of my book and could be another talk
2848000	2855040	but not for tonight only in the bond by virtue of which it eternally asserts its unity as the
2855040	2864480	multiplicity of its things and conversely this multiplicity as its unity is the earth expressive
2864480	2869200	of its true essence and it's not that you think that apart from this infinity of things to be
2869200	2874640	found in the earth there's another one which is the unity of these things rather the same
2874640	2880320	that is the multiplicity is also the unity and the same that is the unity is also the multiplicity
2880320	2891440	and so on existence is the conjunction of one with itself as a many and this conjunction of one
2891440	2901840	and many is a very important topic and this process may sound as though it is linear but
2901840	2909040	it's not it is a circular process and this depends on an inter-hemispheric relationship
2909040	2918240	functioning properly in which like the two brothers in the Onondagen myth flint the left
2918320	2924480	hemisphere representative who actually in the story this was before neuroscience could have
2924480	2933920	prompted this has the arrow and speech and the two great things about manipulation using the
2933920	2941840	right hand to grasp things and to use language to pin them down that are the most archetypal I
2941840	2949280	suppose aspects of the hemisphere these were flint characteristics and they are necessary we're
2949280	2955760	enriched by language we're enriched by enabling to use a bow and arrow but only in the service of
2955760	2961600	something greater that the that flint doesn't understand that his brother does understand
2961600	2969280	and his brother sees that he needs to keep relatively close to the the less wise the less
2969280	2974160	intelligent brother in order that the work of that brother should be profitable and good
2974800	2982320	but not too close because he can't afford to lose what it is that he is able to do through
2982320	2993520	his goodness and his greater wisdom in the cabala a great corpus of Jewish mystical literature
2994160	3000240	the structure of human faculties takes the form of a tree with a right hand side and
3000240	3006480	a left hand side very interesting to me humanities task is to integrate them both
3006480	3012960	laterally and vertically specifically it's held that the mind is made up of two faculties wisdom
3012960	3020320	hochma on the right which receives the gestalt of a situation in a single flash and understanding
3020320	3027760	bina opposite it on the left which builds them up in a replicable step by step way this is the
3027760	3033520	distinction between the right and left hemisphere at least one way of looking at it hochma and bina
3033520	3039360	are considered two friends who never part because you cannot have one without the other hochma gives
3039360	3045600	rise to a force for loving fusion with the other while bina gives rise to judgment which is responsible
3045600	3052160	for setting boundaries and limits their integration is another faculty called dart which is a bit like
3052160	3058800	Aristotle's phronesis or even software and embodied overarching intuitive capacity to know
3058800	3065840	what the situation calls for and to do it what is more this tree is a true organism each part
3065840	3074560	reflected in and qualified by co presence with each of the others so what is united is to be
3074560	3082480	divided and what divided is to be united this involves cyclical returns it follows from this
3082480	3088800	cyclical nature that if you go far enough in any one direction you reach not more of what you desired
3088800	3095120	but it's opposite go east and you eventually reach the west and it follows that both of two
3095120	3101280	opposites are simultaneously present and need to be so just as east and west are simultaneously
3101280	3109840	present on the campus and need to be so not just to navigate the world but to have a world to navigate
3113440	3120160	i finally want to reflect on an asymmetry at the heart of the coincidentia positorum
3122480	3128160	union and division which i've mentioned a lot in this talk are asymmetrical
3129040	3135680	the principle for division and the principle for union are both needed but they're needed
3135680	3143280	to be brought together not divided we need the union of union and division not the division
3143280	3156480	of union and division and in our thinking today we need not either both and or either or but we
3156480	3170320	need both both and and either or equally we need not non duality only but we need the non duality
3170880	3181360	of duality and non duality there's also an asymmetry between symmetry and asymmetry
3181360	3190800	not just an asymmetry of quality which obviously is but an inequality of value
3192240	3200240	asymmetry is more important than symmetry actual occurrence of anything involves the
3200240	3208160	breaking of what is considered in the abstract symmetrical small imbalances differences among
3208240	3215680	sameness at all levels in nature make it work starting with the initial inequality of matter
3215680	3222240	and antimatter i'm told by physicists that if there had not been a small inequality between
3222240	3228560	matter and antimatter at the very beginning of things with the big bang the would have been
3228560	3238400	nothing at all and this is nicely referred to by two great late 19th century french scientists
3238400	3246240	one a biologist the other a physicist already in the 1870s Louis Pasteur was writing sentences
3246240	3251840	that would have anguished his enlightenment forebears the universe as a whole he wrote is
3251840	3258320	asymmetrical and i've come to believe that life as it has manifest to us is a function of the
3258320	3264400	asymmetry of the universe without any doubt i repeat of the basic principles of life are
3264400	3270720	asymmetrical it is because asymmetrical forces of the cosmos preside over their unfolding
3271440	3278880	life is dominated by the effects of asymmetrical forces whose enveloping cosmic existence we sense
3278880	3285280	intuitively i would even say that living species are primordially in their structure in their
3285360	3295920	external forms functions of the cosmic asymmetry and here is the physicist Pierre Curie writing
3295920	3305120	in 1894 certain elements of symmetry may coexist with certain phenomena but they're not necessary
3306000	3314000	what is necessary is that certain elements of symmetry do not exist it is asymmetry which
3314000	3322960	creates the phenomenon and he adds the effects produced may be more symmetrical than their causes
3324720	3329760	in terms of the hemispheres it's once more not a symmetrical but an asymmetrical arrangement
3329760	3335200	not just between two dispositions that of the left hemisphere and that of the right towards the world
3335200	3341520	but between the disposition that sees the two dispositions as an antagonism that must ultimately
3341520	3346720	lead to the triumph of one and the annihilation of the other that's the left hemisphere's take on
3346720	3353040	their relation and the disposition that of the right that sees they need to be preserved together
3353840	3359440	neither being allowed to extinguish the other even though they're not of equal value one the
3359440	3365680	disposition of the right overarches and takes into account the other much as he grasps the sky with
3365680	3372400	both hands not just protects flint but enables the fulfillment of flint's contribution
3375360	3379680	here there's an interesting reflection of William James who I think again is one of the great
3379680	3386720	philosophers of the last hundred years and more looking back on my own experiences they all
3386720	3392080	converge towards a kind of insight to which I cannot help ascribing some metaphysical significance
3392640	3398800	the keynote of it is invariably a reconciliation it is as if the opposites of the world whose
3398800	3404880	contradictoryness and conflict make all our difficulties and troubles were melted into unity
3405600	3413440	not only do they as contrasted species belong to one and the same genus but one of the species
3413440	3423120	the nobler and better one is itself the genus and so soaks up and absorbs its opposite into itself
3426080	3434400	that we mentioned sisterly and deasterly and on this nature of asymmetry and irregularity
3434400	3442800	being more important than symmetry and and regularity I just want to mention something about
3442800	3450400	the movement and rhythm of biological processes these are necessarily not entirely
3451040	3458080	rhythmical they have a kind of flexibility built into them which for those of you who are
3458080	3465440	musicians you will recognize as rubato music that is played entirely mechanically loses
3465440	3471360	its soul and it is the ability to make very small differences in the length of notes
3473280	3478640	that makes a great musical performance you may not even be aware of them in fact you're not
3478640	3483840	necessarily aware of them at all but they are what give life and I was very struck when I was
3485520	3492000	a medical student and I was learning obstetrics on the obstetric board when learned that the
3492720	3498880	trace of the fetal heart when it became regular this was a medical emergency and you called the
3498880	3508800	team urgently the when the fetus is thriving the heartbeat has a flexibility and irregularity
3508800	3515280	that also the adult human heart has if it's functioning properly and this is something also
3515280	3524960	like half rhyme the sort of yes and no at the same time I'd like to write a book called yes and no
3525920	3534960	or in a zen saying not always so and I can't resist just quoting because I'm about to conclude
3535680	3545120	that wonderful poem by Wilfred Owen who used half rhyme so effectively visionary spine chilling poem
3545120	3550960	called strange meeting in which he imagines encountering the German soldier that he's killed
3550960	3558000	the other that is not really an other at all and the poem famously ends with the dead soldier's words
3558000	3567600	to Owen I am the enemy you killed my friend I knew you in this dark for so you frowned yesterday
3567600	3576400	through me as you jabbed and killed I parried but my hands were loath and cold let us sleep now
3576880	3584880	those lines couldn't be so great if they had had full rhymes instead of half rhymes
3586480	3591760	it's interesting by the way that the Russian word for other or different to goi has the same
3591760	3599120	etymological root as the word drug which means a friend anyway I'm going to just wrap up in
3599200	3604800	some final words so I've argued that at the origin of everything there lies a
3608320	3615680	coincidence or conjunction of opposites that is profoundly generative indeed necessary for creation
3616400	3621840	gives rise to all that we know and that this coincidence of opposites is by no means contrary
3621840	3628000	to reason I've stressed that we must not be tempted left hemisphere fashion to resolve the
3628000	3633760	necessary tension by pretending one of the pairs of opposites can safely be dispensed with or is
3633760	3640400	not real denying the concealed opposite is dangerous the coincidence of opposites does
3640400	3647040	not compromise their nature as opposites rather they fulfill themselves through one another
3647040	3652080	at the foundation of everything is this opposition recognized from empedocles to girta
3652080	3658800	between love and strife we need the union of division and union the union of multiplicity and
3658800	3666320	unity the left hemisphere needs ultimately to act as servants the right hemisphere since unbridled
3666320	3672880	the left hemisphere is capable of destroying the world which I believe it is engaged in doing now
3672880	3681760	and was foretold in the Iroquois legend moreover what we think of as good may conceal much harm
3681760	3687840	and what we consider harmful may bring something of great value I've suggested two geometrical
3687840	3693840	images we should be wary of linear models in our attempts to understand the world except at the most
3693840	3700800	minutely local level and replace straight lines with helices which incorporate an acknowledgement
3700800	3706640	of the coincidence of opposites with the idea that there's always change and growth not mere
3706640	3712720	repetition as the image of the circle risks suggesting and just as there's an asymmetry
3712720	3719120	in the relationship of the hemispheres there's an asymmetry in the coincidencia opositorum
3719120	3725600	we need not difference in union but the union of the two we need not non-duality but the
3725600	3732240	non-duality of duality with non-duality and we need not just asymmetry alone or symmetry alone
3732240	3739520	but the asymmetry that is symmetry and asymmetry taken together and my last words are those of
3739520	3747920	Rabbi Jonathan Sacks the chief rabbi of Great Britain who died alas recently I heard him by
3747920	3754720	accident one day on the radio and he told the following short story a holy man is reading the
3754720	3764480	Talmud and he reads that Rabbi X says that a certain thing is the case and he reads further
3764480	3770640	and he finds that another equally revered rabbi says that X is absolutely not the case
3772160	3778000	in a sort of spiritual turmoil he does what any spiritual man would do he prays to God
3778640	3789920	which of them is right and God answers both of them are right somewhat exasperated the man says
3789920	3798000	but what do you mean they can't both be right to which God replies all three of you are right thank
3798960	3799760	thank you very much
3804880	3812560	my goodnessy and what and what a beautifully rich lecture you've just given us I know that
3812560	3818800	there would be resounding applause from the from the the the very the significant number
3818800	3825120	we had 150 or so with us here right now people would be there'd be thunderous applause right now
3825120	3832000	and on top of that there would there would be many many hands raised as the digital hands
3832000	3842560	have indeed been raised that was just a splendid not only examination of a very rich philosophical
3842560	3849040	question but you beautifully brought us in to the very complexity and the unity and the division
3849040	3854080	of unity and division that you are the unity of those things that you are seeking to bring about
3854080	3860480	in us as we were sitting here with you there are many questions here and I have some of my own but
3861200	3866480	it's important to say because there have been several people who've asked will this lecture
3866480	3872560	be available later yes absolutely we'll we'll work the audio in the video in post production and
3872560	3878640	release it as a podcast and on YouTube so stay stay tuned for that we'll make sure to alert you
3878640	3884000	if you sign up for our newsletter which you're free to do on our website if you like I also
3884000	3889520	want to say very importantly that this is a reflection that emerges from Dr. McGilchrist's
3889520	3895280	new book the matter with things which will be available if I'm not mistaken on November 9th
3895280	3900960	in the United States perhaps sooner in other locales but do pay attention for that announcement
3900960	3909120	and pick up a copy of this wonderfully rich text when and as you can now there are many questions
3909120	3915760	here as I say and we could spend our whole lives in a way in this question in a way we
3915760	3925520	do spend our whole lives in the reality that you have been making manifest to us in this lecture
3925520	3930960	I mean this is the world this is the this is precisely what we're living in all the time
3931600	3934720	and it is in fact I would say also precisely this
3935360	3943920	insight that in some sense Ralston College as a whole venture aims to help bring about
3944720	3950880	you know there's a kind of post enlightenment conceit that the only thing we can know so
3950880	3958720	as far as we can know anything at all is in kind of empirical propositional manner and in a sense
3958800	3965120	from that standpoint you know beauty or justice or love or indeed properly speaking even truth
3965120	3973760	itself these are incomprehensible and so your lecture has is bringing about the the kind of
3973760	3980800	thinking that is necessary to really think about these deepest realities and so my first question
3981360	3989680	Ian is how must our conception of reason change in order for us to see that a grasp of the unity
3989680	3998240	of opposites is not incompatible with reason a very very good question thank you Stephen
3999440	4005440	takes me to another very important point and there are different meanings to the word reason
4006160	4009680	and in the book I have three chapters on the nature of reason
4010720	4017120	and it will not surprise you that I am a great fan of reason as I am a great fan of empirical
4017120	4024480	science and I do also happen to believe that it's a mistake to try and take empirical science
4024480	4032800	into areas where it simply has no jurisdiction and to take certain kinds of rationalizing
4032800	4040320	into areas where it cannot be illuminating but I believe we need to make a distinction between
4040320	4045040	things that are beyond the grasp of well we need to make two distinctions one is between
4045040	4051040	things that are beyond the grasp of what people commonly conceive of as reason
4052960	4058080	and things that are within its grasp and the other distinction is between kinds of reason
4058720	4070720	on the first one there is nothing irrational about my love for and my defense of a great piece of
4070720	4080960	music I often say Schubert C major quintet because increasingly it has come over my life to be
4082080	4085760	seen as one of the most powerful pieces of music ever written one of the deepest
4086320	4092480	and yet I cannot in any way rationalize why it works or how it works and if I could I'd
4092480	4097840	be only talking about a few mechanisms either in the brain or in the structure of harmonics
4097840	4104640	that would leave the real truth of it what it is doing and what it is untouched so there should be
4104640	4113360	a word for a realm which is trans-rational or supra-rational and that is I think a concept we
4113360	4123200	need to take back into our lives much that we value in in nature in art in music in human life in
4125840	4132720	approach to the sacred is not irrational just because it cannot be stated purely in logical
4132720	4141440	terms and the other is a defense of a different kind of reason so in English unfortunately we
4141440	4147680	don't make much of a distinction but in Greek in Latin and in German there are distinct words for
4147680	4154400	two kinds of reason one is the carrying out of logical procedures in the way that a computer
4154400	4162160	could be taught to do and the other is what was always considered the flower of education and the
4162160	4169920	flower of a civilization the capacity to produce people who were reasonable people my god how
4170400	4176160	nostalgic that makes me when I look at the world around me and how very few voices I hear
4176160	4182720	that I can call reasonable voices and what I mean by reasonable are not consumed with hatred
4182720	4190320	rage misunderstanding malice the ability to take things out of context to understand them in some
4190320	4197280	purely reduced abstracted way but to put together the fruits of being able to think reasonably
4197520	4206640	rationally and and logically together with an understanding of humanity in all its complexity
4206640	4211840	and that life simply isn't a matter of following certain rules and that the more you know the more
4211840	4217360	you understand you don't know that's a very different kind of reasoning one that cannot emerge
4217360	4224320	from a computer but in an age in which everything is increasingly handed over to a system a computerized
4224320	4230000	system with which we have to interact whatever it is we're doing we are encouraged into a black
4230000	4237280	and white either or abstracted disembodied decontextualized this is what it is or it isn't
4237280	4242480	black and white way of thinking which is the precise opposite the precise opposite of everything
4242480	4253200	I've just argued for I am so glad we're recording this um Ian let me uh let me take us back for
4253200	4257280	a minute I want to talk a little bit later in our Q&A and there are several questions pertaining to
4257280	4263840	education and to sort of the question of what can we do but I want to go back for a minute to
4264560	4272720	the ancient Greeks because there's just following the pre-socratics that you described in Greek
4272720	4278960	history we have the Sophists and one of the things the Sophists do and I think people who are paying
4278960	4286160	attention to our current intellectual climate will see this move all around them is they their
4286160	4293280	their expertise is in showing that any particular position is partial that it's insufficient on
4293280	4302400	its own but then to use that apparent insufficiency to conclude essentially that there is no truth at
4302400	4308080	all as a protagonist says man is the measure of all things that is to say there is no there is no
4308160	4315760	coherence to reality itself there is no truth beyond the insufficiency of the particulars and so
4315760	4324400	what I'm what I'm wanting to ask you is this is what does all this mean that truth is that rather
4324400	4330000	than the insufficiency of the particular showing that there is no truth and certainly today the
4330000	4335520	claim is that truth itself is just a a mechanism or construct of the will to power that rather than
4335520	4344880	that that precisely in these particularities in the movement between the opposites is revealed
4344880	4354880	uncovered made real made manifest something larger deeper more sovereign than the insufficiency
4354880	4362960	of the particulars might initially have us believe well you do you do ask the best questions
4363200	4373040	even again a very difficult one I'll try to answer as economically as I can
4374240	4382480	I think the first thing I'd say is behind the title no matter with things is my dissatisfaction
4383040	4390720	with the way in which we think of everything not just material things which the matter with
4390720	4397120	things refers to as things we think about reality as a thing we think about truth as a thing
4398640	4403920	actually interestingly etymologically it begins as a process that involves a relationship between
4403920	4418480	people and I argue that there is truth there is no one truth there is no one single truth
4419120	4424560	and we can never ultimately know the whole of that truth but some things are truer than others
4424560	4430720	otherwise we wouldn't say anything there'd be no reason for saying anything at all or even getting
4430720	4436880	out of bed or moving because really everything would be as worthless or pointless or as meaningful
4436880	4441680	or meaningless as everything else this cannot possibly be the case nobody acts like this
4442560	4451920	so the problem arises from two positions that I call rot and mumbo rot is the acronym reality
4451920	4457760	out there that the justice of reality somewhere out there and it's untouched by us and it's
4457760	4464480	our job to find it and when we do find it it has nothing of us about it the other I call
4465440	4474640	mumbo which is that reality is made up miraculously by ourselves another acronym and what I'm
4474640	4485360	talking about there is the opposite position beloved of some postmodernist that there is no
4485360	4492320	truth because everybody's truth has its own validity I argue from the very word go and
4492400	4498080	if people want to find this they will find what are my my comments on it of course we extended
4498080	4502720	over the entire book which is a very long book but I have something to say about it in the first
4502720	4509760	ten pages also of volume one of the book and what I'm really emphasizing is that it is neither
4509760	4517760	a thing in here nor a thing out there but is a relationship a reverberative relationship between
4517760	4525680	whatever it is I mean by my consciousness and the conscious cosmos outside of what I consider my
4525680	4534960	consciousness and it's in that coming together of my internal sense of myself with whatever it is
4534960	4542240	that exists that is apart from me at least never ultimately separate from me but utterly distinct
4542240	4553360	from me it's in that coming together that we embark on the process of reality of discovering
4553360	4561200	reality and the first volume my books in two volumes the first volume is called the ways
4561200	4567440	to truth so not a suggestion that it is a journey that may never actually be achieved
4568080	4574560	but it's still an important journey and the second volume is called what then is true
4574560	4580640	an open question but effectively what I'm doing in the first part of the book is saying what can
4580640	4586800	we take as a guide on our journey towards truth I think knowing more about what the brain is
4586800	4594160	telling us can help that's part one neuroscience and I think epistemology the business of studying
4594160	4603040	the values of reason science and intuition and imagination their strengths and values
4603040	4608720	that can tell us when we take those together and look at the cosmos what do we find and what I
4608720	4614000	suggest in part three which is metaphysics is that we find the cosmos very different from the one
4614000	4620000	made up of just a heap of bits that we're told is the nature of the universe we find something
4620000	4632320	that has inherent beauty complexity order a drive has is not alien to us has this paradoxical
4632320	4639920	structure that I've alluded to partly here and in which time is very real consciousness is very
4639920	4646160	real foundational indeed an element in the cosmos that cannot be reduced and that values too are
4646160	4656720	foundational so that's where the whole drift goes my goodness we're never going to get through all
4656720	4662080	these questions because they're so they're so difficult and I just want to thank everyone who
4662080	4665520	we do have some time and we're going to get through many of them but I want to thank everyone for
4665520	4670400	sending your questions and I am going to share these afterwards with Dr. McGilchrist in the event
4670400	4676720	he should ever find an occasion or wish to undertake he does have a channel in which he
4676720	4682160	he shares his work called channel McGilchrist and it may be that he will find time to answer some
4682160	4688560	additional questions there beyond our session today here is here's one from Benedict Ian
4689200	4694160	he says I'd be interested to hear more on the origins of your understanding of this idea at
4694160	4698800	what point did the notion of the coincidence of opposites and in particular of the symmetry
4699680	4705440	and asymmetry first occurred to you and how did this awareness come to you and this may this
4705440	4711440	question may lead us a bit later to the many questions on what we can do and what forms of
4711440	4717360	education are adequate to bringing about the reasonable kind of disposition that you were
4717360	4724400	describing and praising a moment ago I think that probably like most
4724400	4730400	of certainly I can only speak for myself but most of the ideas that still
4732400	4740080	inspire me intrigue me and draw me onwards to further attempts at understanding they started
4740080	4748000	in my teens I had a very philosophical education I was very lucky in that respect
4748000	4755840	and I was taught a number of things as not dogmatically that these were true but they were
4755840	4763760	the assumptions behind what I was told one would be that a thing and its opposite are you know
4763760	4774000	irreconcilable and this is an Aristotelian position that's perfectly respectable and another was that
4774640	4780320	history moves in linear trajectories and I thought no I already thought in my teens no it moves in
4780320	4785920	sort of circles or spirals and I thought when you you know one of the things I noticed in politics
4785920	4791040	was that it was more in common between people on either the extreme left or the extreme right than
4791040	4797680	there was with people who might be thought of as in a completely different realm in a much more
4797680	4806240	moderate realm I now incidentally think that it's hard to get a razor blade between fundamentalist
4806240	4812640	atheists and fundamentalist theists and that these people share very left hemisphere assumptions
4812640	4817600	about the nature of the world that are completely foreign to most people who call themselves honest
4817600	4824320	diagnostics or honest believers but there we go that's for another time but I think that what
4824320	4831440	it was perceptions like that that bitterness and sweetness often complemented one another
4831440	4838640	and led into one another that in certain ways pain and pleasure were necessary to one another
4839360	4845520	that you know that as Blake says contrary is fulfill one another I already was feeling that
4845520	4855120	experiencing that as a young person and I thought also that the world is not inert and
4855120	4861920	unresponsive but something that is responsive essentially that all experience all reality
4861920	4868880	is reverberative I can't think of a better word a resonance a coming a responsibility we have a
4868880	4877200	responsibility for it and it for us response of course comes from the root of calling to
4877200	4882720	and calling back and forth so this sound of it this idea of a sound resonance going back and
4882720	4889440	forwards and a movement reverberation or back and forwards between two things that we thought
4889440	4894720	of as distinct and perhaps not not not mutually influencing one another was another profound
4894720	4902480	perception so I think that that together with my rejection of linearity as a useful model for
4902480	4908880	anything living or anything I experienced and the sense that opposites came here and that when you
4908880	4914400	pursued one you soon found that you were achieving the opposite of the thing that the very thing you
4914400	4921040	thought you were trying to achieve that I noticed in my teens and you know when I look around me
4921040	4929440	now I'm astonished that people don't see how in pursuing goals that they would call you know
4929440	4936960	humane goals to do with all kinds of high ideals that the result can be so different from anything
4938720	4945840	resembling those ideals so there you go famously political systems are founded on
4946320	4954000	great ideals of liberty equality and fraternity end up to be illiberal unfraternal and unequal
4956240	4959040	you know I want to ask you want to make this as
4960480	4967040	concrete in a way as I can one of the things that comes out in the lovely Iroquois
4967120	4975360	legend that you shared with us to read is that the he grasps the sky with both hands the the
4975360	4983760	one figure represents as you write one's higher identity in the midst of action in the world and
4985360	4992320	what what the fact that we're able to perceive opposites
4993200	5002720	as we go through time and find our way through them to deeper understanding what that must mean
5002720	5008880	is that our own subjectivity our own souls our own person hoods whatever we are as entities
5009680	5020320	in some sense is in the image of or has access to that unity that is both
5022960	5029280	higher than but also revealed by an in and through division and
5031360	5036560	so I have it of course we're in big matters here but I have a few questions about that
5038000	5042160	and some of these are trying doing my best to gather up the questions that are
5042160	5048160	wonderfully wonderfully expressed let me say in this Q&A we have 55 questions here
5049120	5054320	are beautiful deep questions we're really this is really the question in a way of our time
5057440	5065280	how do we move to a standpoint then which we don't lose ourselves in division and I don't
5065280	5072400	mean simply culturally we can come to that but I mean ourselves how do we ourselves develop
5072640	5079600	habits or practices what are the the the manners and modes according to which we can
5080800	5086880	recollect or come to the awareness that we are in in the whole
5093840	5100800	yes what of course is strange is that we have to talk about that because in most cultures other
5100800	5106160	than our own modern western one it would seem obvious that we were part of a whole
5108400	5114160	one of the most difficult things is the concept of the environment to me I reject the term
5115040	5119840	because it suggests something that is around you but is not you whereas nature is something
5119840	5123920	out of which we are born which is what the word nature means something that is giving birth
5124480	5132160	and back into which we go so being surrounded by nature as well as bringing a host of
5133520	5140960	health benefits incidentally both physical and psychological and spiritual benefits helps us
5140960	5147520	see ourselves not as isolated beings as it were skittering around on the repellent surface of an
5147520	5155120	alien world but actually deeply deeply embedded in a world that has roots and we have roots in it
5157520	5166880	music poetry and painting but for me particularly music and poetry
5168480	5174480	bring us together with other minds and spirits though those of those who made them and those
5174560	5181440	that we can feel respond to them one of the most rewarding things for me during the first year
5181440	5189200	of lockdown was that every day for 365 days I read a new poem not one of mine but a poem
5189200	5195920	I considered a great poem on the internet and I must say I found it very healing myself and a
5195920	5202000	lot of people wrote to me in very moving terms saying that in this spell of isolation that it made
5202720	5210320	them feel more together with humanity then I think there is the whole way in which we conceive
5210320	5217120	what a society is not an agglomeration of atomistic individuals each out to fulfill their
5219360	5224880	whatever they can get for themselves and whatever they can make of themselves but to see that only
5224880	5231680	in the service to society as a whole that what you achieve is only valuable in as much as it
5231680	5238320	goes back to making a society a better place what you what you want you need of course yourself
5238320	5244960	we're not saints we need food and we need a lot more in order to to be happy but we don't need
5244960	5252000	extraordinary amounts of things and in our society our attitudes that our self-esteem
5252000	5258480	our independence of mind our independence of action that we can do what we like
5260480	5272000	is is odd historically it's odd and I know from talking to some people from other oriental cultures
5272000	5279760	that to them this emphasis on self-esteem and self-determination seems literally sick I mean
5279840	5286880	that's the word that's been used I mean that's sick and I would like of course as always to
5286880	5294240	be able to try and see the virtues in um individuation which is very important and I don't
5294240	5299680	think that oriental cultures negate that at all they they believe it's very important but in the
5299680	5305840	service of fulfillment of the whole so once again that force for division that left hemisphere a bit
5305840	5312560	is incredibly creative and important but in service of a bigger differentiated whole so I see the
5312560	5318720	whole business of things coming into being as not splitting apart but rather like some very
5318720	5325120	enfolded flower imagine the sort of infinitely enfolded infinitely rich flower that had florets
5325120	5332800	within florets in some sort of um fractal way and what happened was that they unfolded and within
5332880	5337520	them something else unfolded and so on the flower was still a flower the flower had that
5337520	5344880	potential but now that potential has been fulfilled and you therefore have togetherness with
5344880	5352000	and wholeness but at the same time individuation I hope that's a sort of relatively brief gloss on that
5354000	5361040	yes I want to I want to drive further into the question of what you know if we're if as I think
5361040	5367920	it's clear we're living in a time of very significant alienation and division I mean
5367920	5372800	there are all kinds of metrics according to which we can understand that we can see the proofs or
5372800	5381760	signs of that the the question on many of our questioner's minds is is is what can we do what are
5381760	5389920	the the the forms of life and culture the institutions the the practices that that that
5391440	5403120	bring us or foster the bringing of us both into ourselves more fully precisely by
5403120	5408640	awakening us in the way that you're describing to our place within in the whole what are the
5408640	5413760	you mentioned of course music and poetry and painting in the in the arts I have the sense
5413760	5419440	that some of our questioners are are trying to ask the question of or indeed are asking the
5419440	5425200	question very explicitly at the big picture where have we gone wrong and what can we rebuild and how
5428720	5435840	well of course that is the big question an easy one to ask in the very very difficult one to answer
5436720	5437200	and
5441600	5450080	not just in the sense that it's hard to make a prescription but that the very fact of trying
5450080	5456160	to make a prescription may be the wrong thing to do in that my prescription may close down
5456160	5461680	options rather than open them up and what the left hemisphere always wants is to close down on
5461760	5467840	the certainty whereas the right hemisphere wants to open up into a possibility and I'll just say
5467840	5472240	it very briefly because people may have heard me say it before but as a psychiatrist one of the
5472240	5476480	things you learn very early on is you may know exactly what a person needs to do but you must
5476480	5482640	not tell them not because you're being sort of frustrating but because to begin with you make
5482640	5487440	the mistake of telling people and they go oh no I can't do that that wouldn't make any sense for me
5488080	5492720	and then you have to allow them to come to a place where they see for themselves and sometimes
5492720	5497840	a year or 18 months later they will come to you and say you know I know what it is I need to do
5497840	5503280	and it's exactly what you told them 18 months ago but so it's no good giving a prescription
5503280	5511200	because people won't follow it or they will think if there's a prescription I can relax because then
5511200	5518000	I do these six bullet points that Dr. McGilchrist has mentioned and phew it's all going to be fine
5518000	5523680	again but it isn't all going to be fine again it may be fine but it will never be fine again in the
5523680	5529760	same way the world that we are leaving behind cannot be recreated and cannot and must not be
5529760	5535760	perpetuated and I often say if we could reverse the poisoning of the oceans the felling of the
5535760	5541040	forests and the destruction of the ways of life of indigenous people around the world which I very
5541040	5547040	much hope we can it would all be in vain if we just carry it on being the same dissatisfied
5547040	5553280	unhappy isolated neurotic people that we now are looking for stuff to get oh thank god we
5553280	5558400	haven't destroyed the rainforest that means the world economy won't collapse and the weather
5558400	5564000	patterns won't be damaging no the reason for not destroying the rainforest is that they are
5564560	5572160	the most extraordinary expression of what this whole cosmos is about they are a wonder of complexity
5572160	5578640	and beauty that is valuable in itself not as the left hemisphere always thinks for some utility
5578640	5588720	of its own so having said that is there anything I can say to indicate ways of going well I'm going
5588720	5596080	to say some rather in the tradition of my talk slightly opposite things I think first of all
5596080	5602400	very obviously that education needs to be much more concerned with things like philosophy
5604240	5610160	teaching people how to think which is not done by shoving information in and then seeing whether
5610160	5615760	they've retained it that is the opposite of teaching people how to think one exercise that every
5615760	5622640	school child every school child should do regularly and shouldn't be allowed to be to leave school
5622640	5628080	without knowing how to do this is to take any point of view argue forcibly for it and then
5628080	5634160	immediately turn around and argue more emphatically for the or more convincingly let me say for the
5634160	5640400	opposite point of view because every point of view has its pros and its cons and I think that
5641360	5647040	yes things like poetry music and so on and history in fact the humanities in general how do we
5647040	5652720	understand ourselves if we know nothing about our history and not just a caricature version
5652720	5660560	of history through a filter that happens to be a set of conceptions and preconceptions we have now
5660560	5666800	but more broadly as broadly and generously as we can and one of the things about the humanities
5666800	5672400	is not imposing on it a grid of your own but trying to come to it and see another way of
5672400	5677280	thinking that other people before you had that may be very different from your own but by no
5677280	5683600	means stupid and make and seal values that you yourself don't see so all of that I think but
5683600	5690320	I also think it's very important for education to be rigorous children like to be challenged and
5690320	5696080	they do actually need to learn things that are difficult you know perhaps an ancient language
5696080	5702800	certainly mathematics they do need to understand good science imaginative science science doesn't
5702800	5710080	have to be killingly boring in the way that it's so often taught science is a is an adventure and
5710080	5715360	if science is not taught as an adventure the teachers need to be sacked because it is it's a
5715360	5722720	wonderful exciting adventure just as exciting as learning poetry and music these things are not at
5722720	5728240	war with one another they are part of one another but if we are only soft on ourselves and on our
5728240	5735760	children our civilization won't survive because there's a sort of prisoner's dilemma here is that
5735760	5740880	it's okay for us to go oh well we're just going to be very relaxed and we're going to do tai chi and
5740880	5746800	we you know all of which I you know don't have any problem with and would enrich an education and
5746800	5753280	doing some mindfulness ought to be part of any school day everybody should learn it but we actually
5753280	5761120	also do need to learn some toughness of mind and toughness of body because there are nations in
5761120	5772800	this world who will aren't just waiting peacefully for you know it's the old story that if you if
5772800	5779920	you want peace prepare for war now I'm not this is not a remark about our military strategy at all
5779920	5787040	it's just saying that we can't afford to be off our guard there's a wonderful book um called um
5787680	5795520	immoderate greatness by patrick offles it's only 80 pages long and it's considerably the best 80
5795520	5801520	pages in terms of bang for buck that you could ever read and it's why all civilizations fail
5801520	5806720	eventually and often quite quickly and it has six reasons three of them are sort of more or less
5806720	5812480	environmental ones and to do with the resource issues and the other three are to do with the
5812480	5822000	way we stop behaving and the stop thinking and in amongst them is this inability to think the
5822000	5826880	way you need to think and act the way you need to act if you're going to defend the civilization
5831600	5835840	yes clearly we're dealing with a civilizational matter here and I think it's very important
5835840	5846640	that we underline that these the truths you're pointing to the unity that transcends and is
5847760	5854720	made manifest by the opposites these modes of thinking these are not the mere you know
5854720	5861360	speculations but an uncovering of what is most fundamentally real this is not an exercise
5861920	5873600	simply or a uh a kind of trivial mental show but to uncover most rigorously what is most
5873600	5881440	profound and animating um on a on a kind of optimistic or questioningly optimistic note
5881440	5888880	one questioner uh Rania Rania asks beginning with a quote from what you've said many aspects
5888960	5893840	of our current plight can be related to our complete failure to understand this essential
5893840	5898880	truth of opposites end quote that was from the abstract that you kindly circulated and then
5898880	5905680	the questioner continues but given that we are part of creation slash existence itself is not
5905680	5912560	this failure to understand also part of the journey on a deeper plane that is does not the plight
5912560	5918640	and failure of understanding in itself in and of itself provide an opposite of sorts to actual
5918640	5923680	understanding and from what we might say and thus perhaps we might hope that our encounter
5923680	5930720	with this opposite of privation and division may precisely be a move towards a recovery of
5931440	5939840	a deeper higher more sovereign unity well well that's another fabulous question I mean
5940000	5949360	um they're just coming in thick and fast this is wonderful uh I mean in brief I absolutely agree
5949360	5957760	with that um I think one of my themes was that we do not know out of what apparent um
5958560	5967200	downturns of fortune something good may come and out of what apparent upturns of fortune
5968160	5975840	bad may come and I think we've seen and are seeing both so I absolutely agree with that
5975840	5980720	it's the famous chinese story you know bad luck good luck who knows you can't see what's coming
5980720	5988400	down the line as the outcome of a certain particular set of circumstances and I think I go further and
5988400	5993920	say that actually out of a certain degree of suffering comes a degree of wisdom it's not
5993920	6000880	a popular point of view these days and there is I certainly not an argument for in any sense
6001520	6006720	increasing or not doing what you can to minimize suffering don't misunderstand me but nonetheless
6006720	6013280	suffering will exist and life has a lot of suffering in it for anybody who's at all um alive to
6014320	6020000	the suffering of others for a start but out of it some good can come and that's a
6020000	6026800	profound truth in all spiritual traditions also I think that not knowing is very important
6026800	6036080	a sense of perplexity a sense of I really don't understand this not just because I'm not bright
6036080	6043840	enough to but because actually this is something that is beyond the understanding of any single
6043840	6051680	human individual at this point is a very helpful point of view and I argue in the second part of
6051680	6059760	the book particularly for the wisdom which is hardly a new thing to anyone who understands the
6061440	6068160	wisdom traditions of China and of India and Japan and the Far East in general
6069040	6075840	the wisdom of unknowing and the wisdom of not doing I mean in a way a lot of the questions
6075840	6080720	are going so what do we what do we do you know and I would say well actually one of the first
6080720	6085600	things to do and actually this is true of talking to a psychiatric patient is well have you thought
6085600	6089920	of trying not doing all the things that you currently are doing because they're not making
6089920	6098320	things better are they and the image that I think is useful here is because we think we
6098320	6102960	make everything happen this is the left hemisphere talking it is the one that makes things happen it
6102960	6110880	has an agenda it makes things accord to its will but in fact very little in life can be made to
6110880	6119280	accord to your will again all the wise philosophers and sages have said to this said this the secret
6119360	6124640	of happiness and fulfilment in life is not trying to force the world to your will but according
6124640	6131200	your will to the world and learning how to as it were surf the waves rather than stand there and
6131200	6139200	be smashed to pieces by them so the image that helps me is that of a gardener does a gardener
6139200	6147680	make a plant grow absolutely not a gardener can either make everything as beneficial as it can
6148240	6157440	for that plant to grow to foster the flourishing of the plant or it can stifle the plant those are
6157440	6162960	the options but they can't make the plant grow so when people are talking about so what do we do
6162960	6167520	how do we make the right human beings well the first thing is to stop doing a lot of what we're
6167520	6173600	doing now and listen listen in the space I mean one of the ways to understand things is to stop
6174560	6180080	constantly holding forth I'm sorry I mean by the nature of this thing I'm spending a lot of time
6180080	6186080	holding forth right now but one of the things I try to build into my days is is listening sitting
6186080	6193920	listening and so I don't think we do enough of that it's not a passive process it's what I call
6193920	6200320	active passivity it's putting yourself in a position of readiness receptiveness
6201120	6206160	and often you understand an answer to what needs to be done at this point when you do that whereas
6206160	6211600	if you carry on arguing what in the Oriental tradition is called monkey mind chattering away
6211600	6218000	about what we must do you missus all together so once again it's not that we need to do nothing
6218000	6223040	and that we know nothing but it's that we need to combine our knowingness with unknowingness
6223760	6230640	and we need to combine our idea of action with a kind of active passivity
6230640	6237040	again the conjunction of opposites is important yes and certainly in for example the play by
6237040	6244000	Sophocles, Oedipus Rex in a way that whole play is about the tragedy of what happens when we assume
6244000	6251440	that what we think we know is absolute and in a way that is related to this next question
6251520	6258720	from Elizabeth about the pain and alienation of our moment she asks do you think the suicide
6258720	6264320	crisis amongst young people is partially a result of discouraging creative and critical
6264320	6270160	thinking in the school system thereby imprisoning them in the no exit left brain
6274000	6279760	yes again I'm sorry I don't always say to every question what a wonderful question but it is
6279760	6288160	we're just getting all the important questions um I mean obviously in part I would it is part
6288160	6299840	of the answer yes the undoubtedly the case um however that epidemic of suicide and the underlying
6300720	6309440	angst depression despair emptiness boredom that seemed to characterize
6311440	6318800	the world that young people are inheriting has many causes and really one way of looking at my
6318800	6325120	book the matter with things is I'm trying to say well what is the matter with things
6325840	6333120	um and one is this view that we are nothing but I talk about the school of nothing but
6333760	6338400	in which you know people say oh it's nothing but or we're nothing but and so on this is always
6338400	6344000	fallacious it's always um hiding a piece of shoddy thinking because nothing is ever nothing but
6344000	6352560	anything else um however um I think it comes from many causes I think all the things that
6353200	6359840	what we essentially need is meaning a life without meaning is not a worth living it's not
6359840	6369280	worth life worth living um and I want to get rid of one misconception right away this doesn't
6369280	6374720	mean that we should invent meaning it means that we should discover meaning meaning is there
6374720	6381360	all right beauty is there all right complexity is there all right purpose is there I argue
6381920	6387040	and I can't have time to argue that but I do in the book all right they're there
6389440	6398400	but it is our task to respond to them to see them and to incorporate them and when we do
6399200	6407680	life becomes rich we start to flourish society starts to flourish when we don't the opposite
6407680	6416160	of all those things is the case and what has very much struck me and I referred to one of these
6416160	6422800	in the end of the master and his emissary is the effect of social cohesion so belonging to
6422800	6428720	a cohesive social group which is not just a group of people a bubble sphere on the internet that
6428720	6436080	just happened to share opinions but a living group of people who are able hard at the moment I know
6436080	6444320	but to share their lives you know I refer to the research on close Italian communities in the east
6444320	6450720	coast of America where communities carried on the ways of life that they brought from Italy
6450720	6455920	in which they they had they did all kinds of things that were very bad for their health like
6455920	6462560	eat fatty food drink loads smoke loads not take a huge amount of exercise and they turned out to have
6462560	6468160	lower rates of heart disease and so on and very much happier than the rest of the population
6468160	6474960	and why was this because they had huge what's called social capital social belonging they
6474960	6481760	they all knew where they belong in society that's the first the second is belonging in nature and
6481760	6486720	we've done everything we can to alienate ourselves from nature to treat it as a resource that is to
6486720	6494640	be exploited and many of us don't live surrounded by nature sadly I mean it's have no choice other
6494640	6501600	than to live in this dispossessed concrete world but that that research on this is massive makes a
6501600	6511360	huge difference to cognitive ability to memory but also to sense of happiness and anxiety to
6512320	6521520	sense of worth and to behavior and the third one surprise surprise is spirituality is believing
6522240	6533600	in a spiritual world and preferably being actively involved in the community that
6533600	6540560	worship together so these three things are now rather rare in our world and where they exist
6540640	6546080	they do help but if you really wanted to make a totally miserable world what you'd do is take
6546080	6551280	people as far away from the natural world as possible and surround them by by machines and
6551280	6558400	virtuality you would disrupt society set individual against individual and say everybody has a right
6558400	6564240	to do whatever they want to do quite regardless of what might be good for the well-being of a
6564240	6569600	community in the society and you tell people that religion was all rotten that essentially they
6569600	6573440	didn't mean anything the world didn't mean anything and the sooner it was over the better
6574320	6580240	if you do that you'll make a very very unhappy world and the evidence is that we are I'll finish
6580240	6586000	with just one thing I have to mention because it's so staggering research by American psychologist
6586000	6594000	Jean Twenge on adolescence between the 1930s and now is based on the same test being administered
6594000	6601280	in the same words to the same age group over that period of over 70 years so it's not the
6601280	6607280	retrospective scope and open to interpretation they just ask them the same questions about how
6607280	6613280	happy they were how anxious they were etc etc there's quite a lot of these questions and what it
6613280	6621360	found was that anxiety depression loneliness and a sense of the worthlessness of life was five to
6621920	6628880	eight times higher in 2007 than it had been in 1930 so for all the improvements that we
6628880	6633840	think we've brought about in our world where everybody must be much happier now people are
6633840	6640240	not much happier now that should stop us thinking and it's not five to eight percent higher which
6640240	6644320	would be kind of significant it's five to eight times as many
6645120	6653040	she's there's such deep matters you know I I know our time is is short I want to ask you
6653040	6661760	just a couple of final questions and one of them I want to begin just by reading back this lovely
6661760	6669040	line of of hurtle and that you've given us in the reading the heart's wave would never have
6669040	6676400	risen up so beautifully in its cloud of spray and become spirit were it not for the grim old
6676400	6686240	cliff of destiny standing in its way we have a questioner who is asking about love
6687760	6693440	it does love show away and if I can try to put this together what I
6694240	6696240	want to ask is
6700000	6707040	first you know love in our own personal you know in our lives you know the lives in which we
6707040	6714000	encounter love this does have to do with the unity of the opposites you know we that's what
6714000	6722880	forgiveness is is the overcoming in a way of an opposite it's the the the holding on to someone
6724400	6724880	to
6728000	6736640	to discover in that relationship and in them and for them to discover in themselves a
6738960	6747280	a beauty a unity that abides and that perhaps becomes more beautiful in and through the the
6748080	6753360	the suffering or division or difficulty or hardness of life and
6755680	6763120	and yet I I think one thing that many people struggle with the alienation the the sense of
6766160	6776240	sadness of loneliness somehow at a deep level psychologically that's giving up on belief that
6777680	6788000	they that they are loved that they have in themselves a abiding
6789680	6796480	hole that they are they are connected with a treads call it a transcendent hole that is
6796480	6802640	manifest in themselves but that they something very deep in the nature of things has their back
6803600	6810080	and so I'm wondering if you would say something about love as we move towards concluding
6813600	6822080	yes well of course it's not everybody's gift to be able to feel that they are loved
6823040	6830000	or have the capacity of love or that there is a something that has their back and the
6830960	6837920	the utter terribleness of depression which is something of which I have too much personal
6837920	6843920	experience and of which I've seen so much over 40 years of trying to help other people with it
6844480	6851520	is that you lose the sense that you have any of the things that normally make life worth living
6852400	6859920	it's so terrible that it can well induce despair so
6861920	6868960	obviously that is a pathological state but I'm just saying that to help anybody who's listening
6868960	6877600	who doesn't feel that comfortable feeling that they are not alone in that and that it can be
6877600	6884720	got through and that coming through it can hard as it may seem also be part of enrichment
6886080	6892880	which actually oddly relates to the grim cliff of destiny in a way that your spirit grows through
6892880	6900720	overcoming things it can be crushed and never recover for some people and that of course is
6900720	6908400	a terrible tragedy what you do with your spirit what you do with the oppositions the resistance
6908400	6916080	of which life largely consists is our business it's each person's business what they do with
6916080	6923280	that and how they respond to it and I'm all too aware how very very difficult it is so
6923280	6930320	I wouldn't wish to preach in any sense but if it's possible to get to a position where you
6930320	6941840	can see that love is not annihilated by suffering but often actually incorporate suffering and heal
6941840	6949280	suffering but it's never going to be devoid of suffering then you've reached a position of
6949280	6954560	considerable wisdom and you've said a couple are a kind of opposites and I know what you're
6954560	6961920	getting at but of course they're not really opposites in a bad way that they're individually
6962720	6968560	separate beings but they're also part of one something which is the coming together of them
6969200	6975280	and there I suppose the image that I would leave people with is like two heavenly bodies that are
6975280	6982080	orbiting one another and what you don't want is them to be so alien that they fly off into space
6982080	6988960	but what you don't want either is for them to be so sucked into one another's gravitation
6989520	6996480	that their orbits collapse and they crash together and there are couples who become as we say
6997600	7003680	in the trade fused and this is usually not a good sign and the relationship rarely survives
7004240	7011200	there needs to be a healthful distance but that distance doesn't mean alienation just as
7011200	7018960	distinction doesn't mean separation if we could only get those distinctions right in our own minds
7018960	7027280	then many many good vivifying things would follow so let me leave it at that but love I mean is
7029040	7035760	when I talk about these things and I talk about the union of things the ultimate forces it seems
7035760	7044880	to me that we know of our gravity and love and these are forces that that there are opposite
7044880	7052480	forces to them that cause other movements but that they are what gives the structure the
7052480	7061120	complexity the beauty the shape the order to everything and stop division triumphing over union
7062080	7071120	in the end that unifying force is more powerful than its opposite I don't duck the question of
7071120	7077440	the existence of evil because I think it's it's really having your cake and eat it to say there
7077440	7082640	is good but there is no evil I mean if there's a conjunction of opposites then there will be
7083600	7091120	and no religion tells you that everything is just fine and everything is good and there is no
7091120	7099840	suffering and and so on and Jesus himself didn't pray that we should all just not be quite as bad
7099840	7105760	but played for deliverance from evil I mean that those are the very words of the Lord's prayer
7105760	7111840	if they mean anything it means that there is some counterbalancing force I personally believe that
7112640	7118960	but I also believe in the same spirit that I've said everything tonight that there is an asymmetry
7119680	7124400	and I argue about that much greater length of course in a very long chapter in the book which
7124400	7130160	is like a short book itself on the sense of the sacred but there I would say that in the end it
7130160	7137600	is love that triumphs it is love that holds the day and it is love that grounds the cosmos
7137600	7148640	well those are words I think on which we should conclude today in and in gratitude I
7149360	7158880	just want to return to your image of the of the spiral and seems that these are weighty but also
7158880	7164880	exciting times that we are living in you talked about the way in which the
7165840	7173760	temporal and eternal come together the universal and the particular in a certain sense the universal
7174560	7181920	has its life only in the particulars and what I want to thank you for on behalf of all of those
7181920	7187440	who've been with us today and who and the many who will will will listen to your lecture later online
7188400	7198320	is the way that you have enlightened us to embrace our own particularity and to be open to it
7198320	7208720	as a site of revelation it's been a very very beautiful time of discussion and illumination Ian
7209280	7216720	thank you very much thank you thank you very much Stephen and thank you all of you for listening
7216800	7221360	and for such very good questions I will be sure to send you with the rest of these
7221360	7228960	magnificent questions your way as soon as as soon as we conclude that is all for now everyone thank you bye
