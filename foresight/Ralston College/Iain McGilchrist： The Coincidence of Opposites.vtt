00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
You

00:30.640 --> 00:36.480
Thank you everyone. I'm sorry a little trouble getting my my video to stop there. I'm not yet

00:36.480 --> 00:42.160
the master of the zoom medium. Though you'd think after a year and a half of COVID we would all be

00:42.160 --> 00:50.080
great experts. It's a it's a huge pleasure today to welcome you all to this live lecture with Dr. Ian

00:50.080 --> 00:54.320
McGillchrist. I'm Stephen Blackwood. I'm the president of Ralston College, a new institution of

00:54.320 --> 01:00.960
higher education. I'm streaming live from the beautiful city of Savannah in the state of Georgia

01:00.960 --> 01:06.080
in the United States. I welcome you all here. I know we have a wide range of time zones. So it's

01:06.080 --> 01:12.640
good morning, good afternoon or good evening depending on where you are. I know that Dr. Ian

01:12.640 --> 01:17.840
McGillchrist needs little introduction. We're honored to have him as a visitor of the college.

01:17.920 --> 01:24.480
He is a psychiatrist, a literary scholar, a philosopher in the true sense of the term a

01:24.480 --> 01:30.400
polymath, a man who has learned about many different disciplines and fields of knowledge

01:31.920 --> 01:37.920
in very deep and interconnected ways. And in fact, that interconnection is one of the persistent

01:37.920 --> 01:44.800
themes of his work that I think is sure to come out today. Dr. McGillchrist has written a new book

01:44.800 --> 01:53.440
which is about to be published. It's a landmark work or going to be. It's a very substantial

01:54.000 --> 02:01.200
two volume book called The Matter with Things. And the lecture today is going to be a,

02:02.240 --> 02:09.120
as it were, an introduction to at least some of the themes that are sketched or not sketched,

02:09.120 --> 02:15.680
but argued at length in that book. His title today is called The Coincidence of Opposites.

02:15.680 --> 02:18.960
And those of you who've had the chance perhaps to study philosophy will know that this is an

02:18.960 --> 02:26.000
ancient theme going back to the earliest moments of recorded human thinking. And I know that we're

02:26.000 --> 02:32.080
all looking forward to see just how Dr. McGillchrist introduces this to us. I wanted to note that he

02:32.080 --> 02:37.600
has shared with us a couple of pages of preliminary reading. I know that was shared with all of you

02:37.600 --> 02:44.560
in advance, but it's on our website at www.rollston.ac on the webpage for this event. If you haven't

02:44.560 --> 02:50.160
had a chance to read that, you can do so afterwards. All right. The format today will be that Dr.

02:50.160 --> 02:55.200
McGillchrist, to whom I'll turn things over momentarily, is going to give us a lecture

02:55.200 --> 03:00.640
of somewhere around an hour or thereabouts. And then we're going to open things up for a

03:00.640 --> 03:06.480
conversation and audience questions. So please feel free to shoot as many questions as you like

03:06.480 --> 03:11.440
through the chat. Dr. McGillchrist and I will do our best to get through as many of them as we can,

03:11.440 --> 03:18.160
and to make this as conversational and richly participatory as we can.

03:18.160 --> 03:23.360
Anyway, with that said, Dr. McGillchrist, oh, I need to say one more thing, and that is that

03:24.240 --> 03:31.680
you'll see that Dr. McGillchrist's screen is a little low resolution. Well, I received an email

03:31.680 --> 03:37.360
from him just a couple of hours ago saying that on the Isle of Skye off the northwest coast of

03:37.360 --> 03:42.960
Scotland, where he lives on the Talisker Bay, some of you may know the whiskey Talisker,

03:42.960 --> 03:48.640
if you don't, I encourage you to sample it, that there is a torrential rainstorm currently

03:48.640 --> 03:55.120
underway, a violent bit of weather. And because his internet capabilities are mediated by a

03:55.120 --> 03:59.600
satellite, it is affected by the weather. We're independently recording this lecture

04:01.120 --> 04:07.520
in Ian's office there in both video and audio, so we anticipate having a high level of

04:08.720 --> 04:14.400
production in what we can subsequently share as a podcast and on YouTube. But I must,

04:15.520 --> 04:20.800
Dr. McGillchrist and I both ask for your patience with respect to the what could be some interruptions

04:20.800 --> 04:27.440
today. Stick with us. I know it will be worthwhile. And perhaps there's something good

04:27.440 --> 04:34.640
in being reminded about the insurmountable realities of nature that even our confident

04:34.640 --> 04:41.760
technology cannot ultimately, reliably always tame. Anyway, with that introduction, Ian,

04:41.760 --> 04:44.800
what a great pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for joining us today.

04:45.520 --> 04:50.160
Oh, thank you so much, Stephen. And it's been a great honor to be

04:51.440 --> 04:57.200
accepted as a visitor of Rawson College. And I wish Rawson College and yourself

04:57.200 --> 05:04.080
every conceivable success as it flourishes and goes forward. So thank you for inviting me along

05:04.160 --> 05:14.240
here tonight. As you hear, I have a rather oppositional relationship with technology,

05:14.240 --> 05:22.080
and usually it finds ways of frustrating me. And tonight it's doing so mediated by a good old storm.

05:22.640 --> 05:32.080
So I'll do my best. Now as Stephen was mentioning, I've been spending the last

05:32.080 --> 05:37.840
10, 12 years writing a book called The Matter with Things, which is a pun, as you can possibly

05:37.840 --> 05:46.800
imagine, on several levels. And one of the things that we, in my view, get wrong is that we fail to

05:46.800 --> 05:54.560
understand anymore that things and their opposites are not as irreconcilable and as far apart from

05:54.560 --> 06:00.400
one another as they might seem. That may be a product of a number of things, the history of

06:00.400 --> 06:06.720
philosophy, but it's imaged in our love of straight lines. So the two ends of a straight line, you

06:06.720 --> 06:12.800
think as far as you project them in one direction, they get further and further away from the end

06:12.800 --> 06:19.360
of the line in the opposite, as we call it, direction. Since my teens, I've not thought that

06:19.360 --> 06:25.920
this was actually the case, and that opposites tended eventually to coincide. Anyway, I'll have

06:25.920 --> 06:34.800
some reflections to say about this from a number of viewpoints, and a few reflections on the current

06:35.520 --> 06:45.680
state of things in our society, where I believe if we could grasp the idea that opposites do not have

06:46.400 --> 06:56.960
this linearly irreconcilable relationship, we might produce a happier world and a better

06:56.960 --> 07:03.200
society. What we call opposites are often facets of one and the same thing. So I'm going to talk

07:03.200 --> 07:09.200
about this from a number of angles, and I wanted to start with three quotations, which are actually

07:09.200 --> 07:17.760
also on the little piece that I shared with you earlier, which relates a most extraordinary

07:18.880 --> 07:27.040
Iroquois legend, the legend of the Onondaga people, and I do urge you to read it. It was brought to

07:27.040 --> 07:33.120
my attention by an anthropologist who commented on the extraordinary number of parallels between

07:33.120 --> 07:40.720
it and the thesis of the master and his emissary, and I will refer to it very briefly. But first of

07:40.720 --> 07:48.960
all, I want to mention three sayings. The first is from a philosopher, the second from a physicist,

07:48.960 --> 07:54.160
and the third from a poet, and I find myself in my writing often drawing these three strands

07:54.160 --> 08:02.320
together incidentally. From C. S. Perse, the American pragmatist philosopher,

08:03.520 --> 08:12.160
a thing without oppositions, ipso facto does not exist. Existence lies in opposition.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.720
Existence lies in opposition.

08:17.440 --> 08:24.800
Then from Niels Bohr, it is the hallmark of any deep truth that its negation is also a deep truth.

08:24.800 --> 08:33.680
So that not only things have this contrary constitution, as Perse was pointing out, but

08:33.680 --> 08:43.600
that the things that we see as opposites often are not opposites at a deep level. There are many

08:43.600 --> 08:51.040
superficial truths that are obviously mutually exclusive. Either I had milk in my coffee at

08:51.040 --> 08:57.680
breakfast time or I didn't, and Bohr was very willing to accept that, but he saw more and more

08:57.680 --> 09:02.480
that the deeper you went into the structure of reality, the more it was the case that a thing

09:02.480 --> 09:11.840
and its opposite could be true at the same time. And the third is from the German romantic

09:11.840 --> 09:18.880
poet Friedrich Höllerlin. The heart's wave would never have risen up so beautifully in its

09:18.880 --> 09:26.880
cloud of spray and become spirit, were it not for the grim old cliff of destiny standing in its way.

09:28.400 --> 09:34.240
Another theme that's very important in my work is that of the creative nature of resistance.

09:34.240 --> 09:40.080
In fact, nothing can be created. Nothing can come into being without resistance.

09:42.480 --> 09:52.640
As you know, if you know anything about my work, I have been involved for 30 years or more

09:52.640 --> 09:59.840
in researching differences between the two brain hemispheres. And these two brain hemispheres

09:59.840 --> 10:08.480
illustrate something rather important that they work together but apart. They co-operate by opposing

10:08.480 --> 10:15.360
one another. And that is actually very much like the way nature in general works. We've

10:15.360 --> 10:22.080
brought into a myth that actually all the history of nature is one of competition.

10:22.640 --> 10:27.520
But it's as much or more, I would argue, and many biologists would argue,

10:28.240 --> 10:36.320
it's more a history of co-operation. And the coming together of competition and co-operation

10:36.320 --> 10:45.280
produces what I call collaboration. And the two hemispheres need to inhibit one another,

10:45.280 --> 10:50.800
to inform one another. They need to stand back and away from one another and at times to work

10:50.800 --> 10:58.160
in unison. They have an interesting relationship which is oppositional but by no means contradictory.

10:59.440 --> 11:04.000
And that is really beautifully brought out in the Iroquois legend of these two brothers that

11:04.000 --> 11:11.760
create the world. And they have this difference of stance. But one knows more than the other and

11:11.760 --> 11:19.120
needs to keep the other one under its aegis, under its watchful eye. And that is, as I argued in the

11:19.120 --> 11:23.680
book The Master and His Emissary, the relationship between the right and the left hemisphere. So

11:23.680 --> 11:28.880
the right hemisphere understands and sees things that the left hemisphere doesn't. And that for

11:28.880 --> 11:35.040
that reason, the left hemisphere should always be in service to the right hemisphere. It makes

11:35.040 --> 11:46.480
a very good servant but a very poor master. Everything that exists could be thought of as

11:46.480 --> 11:53.920
a form of energy. After all, one of the most famous equations in the world, E equals mc2,

11:53.920 --> 12:01.280
tells us that energy and mass are inter-convertible. Energy is always characterized by the coming

12:01.280 --> 12:07.760
together of apparent opposites. Apparent because this is how we've conceived things left hemisphere

12:07.760 --> 12:15.040
fashion. As in the positive and negative poles of electricity, the north and south poles of the

12:15.040 --> 12:23.280
magnet, or in a quite different sense, the merging of male and female gametes in the origin of new

12:23.280 --> 12:28.880
life. And interestingly, if you see cell division under a microscope, it looks extraordinary like

12:28.880 --> 12:36.720
the work of a magnet with iron filings. There are famous illustrations of this and it's been

12:36.720 --> 12:45.760
commented on since the middle of the 19th century. The best known expression of the idea of complementary

12:45.760 --> 12:55.920
opposites is that of the Taijitu symbol, commonly known as the yin yang symbol. And yin yang is

12:55.920 --> 13:04.240
probably the most sophisticated expression of an idea that is existent in cultures all over the world.

13:05.760 --> 13:12.400
From all parts of the world that I know through anthropology, that is a myth of

13:12.400 --> 13:19.840
two opposite forces that need one another. And the fact that it's been somewhat vulgarized is not a

13:20.800 --> 13:26.000
any argument against it any more than the fact that there are mistaken followers of a religion

13:26.000 --> 13:32.400
vitiates the importance of that religion. But we do live a known world in which we want to

13:33.680 --> 13:41.280
try and simplify. And this business of the coming together of opposites frustrates that wish to be

13:42.080 --> 13:50.000
simple. You often hear people of a spiritual bent saying, all is one. And it sounds wonderful,

13:50.000 --> 13:58.480
doesn't it? It sounds so calming. It sounds so deep. All is one. And it's true. But so is it that

13:58.480 --> 14:08.160
all is many. And now what? Neither of these truths is a lesser truth than the other. Indeed,

14:08.160 --> 14:16.000
one of the ways of looking at the whole creative cosmos is of the continuing unfolding, the endless

14:16.000 --> 14:25.280
unfolding of individuation out of union, not so as to thunder or fragment, but so as to enrich

14:25.840 --> 14:35.280
that whole. So I would say the very drive of the cosmos is about distinction without separation.

14:35.280 --> 14:45.440
Gerta said, and Gerta, to me, is one of the all time greatest minds, indeed a true polymath,

14:46.000 --> 14:56.720
a poet, a philosopher, a playwright, a statesman, a scientist, a man of enormous wisdom. And what

14:56.720 --> 15:04.720
he said was dividing the united, uniting the divided is the very life of nature. This is

15:04.720 --> 15:11.520
the eternal sisterly and deasterly, the eternal coalescence and separation, the inhalation and

15:11.520 --> 15:17.840
exhalation of the world in which we live, and where our existence is woven, a very beautiful

15:17.840 --> 15:24.480
and important word that woven about the coming together of different threads in the tapestry or

15:24.480 --> 15:34.000
in the net to create something new. And we think of this idea as essentially one that is

15:34.720 --> 15:42.080
eastern in origin. But as I've just pointed out, it's there in the western tradition,

15:42.080 --> 15:47.120
even Gerta at the time of the Enlightenment was saying it. And in the earliest and in my view

15:47.120 --> 15:53.280
greatest of all the Greek philosophers, Heraclitus, he said many things that are relevant, but I just

15:53.280 --> 16:00.240
want to mention two. They do not understand, he said, how a thing agrees at variance with itself.

16:01.120 --> 16:07.440
It is an attunement turning back on itself, like that of the bow and the liar.

16:08.480 --> 16:16.720
The word he used there is harmonia, the origin of our concept of harmony. And the idea of harmony,

16:16.720 --> 16:22.400
of course, is not that everything is the same, but that everything within the harmony is different,

16:23.040 --> 16:28.240
but is brought into a fruitful union with all the other parts of the harmony.

16:29.200 --> 16:36.160
And the image of the bow and the liar are simple and very powerful. The ends of a

16:36.160 --> 16:43.280
liar string are pulled apart. Effort is put into torturing that string. And you might think,

16:43.280 --> 16:49.360
why pull in opposite directions? Why not just simplify and not pull at all? But then the

16:49.360 --> 16:55.840
string goes slack. It's no longer taught. And there is no note that comes forth from the

16:55.840 --> 17:02.800
string of the liar. There is no arrow that comes forth from the string of the bow. Its existence

17:02.800 --> 17:12.000
depends on exactly this balance of pulling in opposite directions. Harmony in the Greek of

17:12.000 --> 17:18.400
Heraclitus had three principal meanings. One was the fitting together of surfaces.

17:19.440 --> 17:25.760
As we say, surfaces that are true to one another, or as we say, marry. If you're a carpenter,

17:26.080 --> 17:34.720
you talk about a true fit, or a surfaces marrying. The second is the reconciling of warring parties.

17:34.720 --> 17:40.880
So Heraclitus famously said that war is the father of all things, but he could have said that

17:40.880 --> 17:47.600
peace is the queen of all things, because both this war and peace need to be harmonized.

17:48.480 --> 17:53.040
And it's in its most common, modern meaning, the accord of musical strings.

17:53.760 --> 18:00.480
The second saying of Heraclitus I'd like to advert to is another one, I think probably the

18:00.480 --> 18:09.360
richest and the most difficult to understand. And it begins with the word salipsis, or in his

18:09.840 --> 18:20.800
or in his Ionic Greek, Syllapsius. But anyway, we would say salipsis. Graspings, it's translated,

18:21.760 --> 18:30.000
hole and not holes, convergent divergent, consonant dissonant, from all things one

18:30.000 --> 18:36.800
and from one things all. Now the Greek word salipsis here translated grasping seems again

18:37.600 --> 18:44.720
to suggest several ideas, something grasped, perhaps suggesting sudden comprehension,

18:45.520 --> 18:52.320
something that brings elements together, and fertility. Aristotle uses the word to mean the

18:52.320 --> 19:00.240
sexual generation of life, coming together, as I mentioned earlier, of the male and female gametes.

19:01.200 --> 19:07.520
It's hard to overestimate the richness of this fragment, it says so many things at once, that

19:07.520 --> 19:14.000
a deep understanding of the nature of reality comes in glimpses, or grasping, moments of insight,

19:15.120 --> 19:21.200
that in that insight, which by the way is very robustly associated with the right cerebral

19:21.200 --> 19:29.120
hemisphere, particularly with the right superior temporal area, that in those moments of insight,

19:29.280 --> 19:36.800
all is neither simply single nor simply manifold, neither simply whole nor simply not whole,

19:36.800 --> 19:43.600
neither simply like nor simply unlike, each thing working with and by the same token working against

19:43.600 --> 19:49.360
the others, that the one and the many bring one another forth into being, together generating

19:49.360 --> 19:56.080
the reality that has this structure at its core. And that despite, or in light of all this perhaps

19:56.080 --> 20:04.240
because of the nature of this multiplicity, all is held together in a salipsis, the only word here,

20:04.240 --> 20:11.040
not to be paired with its antithesis. And the whole saying is itself, of course, a salipsis,

20:11.040 --> 20:17.440
a gathering, which in its fertility births a salipsis, a moment of dawning insight in us.

20:18.400 --> 20:25.280
So to move right forward from the sixth century BC, to the last hundred years,

20:25.280 --> 20:33.360
we've discovered that not only can small elements in matter manifest either as a wave,

20:33.360 --> 20:40.800
or as a particle that seem contrary types of element, but they can manifest as waves and

20:40.880 --> 20:51.360
particles simultaneously. And here again is a very important idea that we don't have to see one

20:51.360 --> 20:56.880
and then the other, but see them nested within one another. Thus we're used to thinking of the

20:56.880 --> 21:04.320
individual and the general, the temporal and the eternal, the embodied and the disembodied as

21:04.320 --> 21:12.160
exclusive pairings. But it was possibly Goethe's greatest insight to see that they're present

21:12.160 --> 21:19.040
simultaneously in one another. They're found not by turning one's back on the supposed opposite,

21:19.040 --> 21:26.800
but by going more deeply into it. Thus the general is found in the individual, the eternal in the

21:26.880 --> 21:35.760
temporal, the spiritual in the embodied. This tension is creative, generative. Although a

21:35.760 --> 21:40.560
thing and its opposite or a thing and its negative are customarily thought of as separate warring

21:40.560 --> 21:47.760
entities, they are, I argue, mutually sustaining, inseparable and intertwined. You cannot have

21:47.760 --> 21:54.880
heat without cold or brightness without darkness. We can't keep the mountains, as Alan Watts put

21:54.880 --> 22:03.280
it, and get rid of the valleys. And we have one such enigma at the very core of our being,

22:03.280 --> 22:08.160
the corpus callosum, the body of fibers that connects the two hemispheres at their base.

22:08.880 --> 22:15.920
In connecting, it separates. In separating, it connects. And as if being intuitively aware of

22:15.920 --> 22:22.000
this in the Upanishads, we read, in the space within the heart lies the controller of all.

22:22.640 --> 22:28.240
He is the bridge that serves as the boundary to keep the different worlds apart.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.760
An interesting gloss on the idea of a bridge.

22:34.560 --> 22:41.360
Quite a homely example of that, of course, is the eardrum. The eardrum separates one part of

22:41.360 --> 22:47.760
the ear from another. But without it, we couldn't hear sound at all. It's actually caused by the

22:47.760 --> 22:55.360
vibrations, the reverberations, the to and fro movement of this separative element.

22:57.440 --> 23:05.280
Often inhibition releases and creates. Often delimitation is what makes a thing come into

23:05.280 --> 23:12.720
being. Indeed, that is what defines anything. And friction is an interesting example of something

23:12.720 --> 23:19.680
that is, in a way, in opposition to movement. But in its absence, movement becomes impossible.

23:20.880 --> 23:25.680
It's the very constraint, isn't it, on movement, friction. But it's also what makes movement

23:25.680 --> 23:32.480
possible at all. It's true in its excess, we're immobilized, yet so we are in its absence. There's

23:32.480 --> 23:39.280
nothing to push against. Resistance can put the brakes on motion or cause motion. It can prevent

23:39.280 --> 23:45.600
or cause change. It prevents us with an obstacle and thereby forces us to shift our point of view.

23:45.600 --> 23:51.840
It helps us shift the plane of focus so that we see something new. In itself, resistance

23:51.840 --> 23:56.880
is neither necessarily good nor necessarily bad. It's just necessary.

23:59.200 --> 24:06.960
To make a good apple pie, you don't need bland apples. You need nice tart apples and very good

24:06.960 --> 24:15.120
sweet honey. William Blake wrote, without contraries is no progression. Attraction and repulsion,

24:15.760 --> 24:23.440
reason and energy, love and hate are necessary to human existence. And we shouldn't try to get

24:23.440 --> 24:28.800
round this by saying, well, yes, actually, but there's a way of blending them so that we don't

24:28.800 --> 24:35.120
have to deal with that. The philosopher Jacob Needleman wrote, stay with the contradiction.

24:35.120 --> 24:40.480
If you stay, you will see that there's always something more than two opposing truths. The

24:40.480 --> 24:46.720
whole truth always includes a third part, which is the reconciliation. Those of you who are familiar

24:46.720 --> 24:54.640
with the philosophy of Hegel will know the concept of Aufhebern, that coming together of two things

24:54.640 --> 25:02.080
that appear to be opposite into a fruitful new union. But it's not just Hegel, one of my favorite

25:02.080 --> 25:08.240
philosophers, and I believe one of the greatest of the last 100 years is Alfred North Whitehead,

25:08.240 --> 25:16.400
again, a great philosopher, mathematician and scientist. To have seen it from one side only

25:16.400 --> 25:24.080
is not to have seen it. He also said, by the way, that there are no whole truths, only half

25:24.080 --> 25:30.960
truths, is taking the half truths for whole truths that plays the devil. My word, I wish politicians

25:31.600 --> 25:37.440
and their over-vocal spokesman on the internet remembered that fact.

25:39.360 --> 25:46.640
Opposites, please remember this, genuinely coincide while remaining opposites.

25:47.760 --> 25:52.320
Some philosophies tend to collapse into the monism that opposites are identical.

25:53.040 --> 25:59.040
Others into the dualism that opposites remain irreconcilable and are merely at most juxtaposed.

25:59.600 --> 26:06.000
The important perception is that opposites not only co-indexist, but give rise to and fulfill

26:06.000 --> 26:14.800
one another. As Nils Bohr said, Contraria sunt complementa. He took that as his

26:14.800 --> 26:21.040
family motto when he was ennobled by the Danish government. Contraries fulfill one another. And

26:21.040 --> 26:26.000
they're conjoined, like the poles of a magnet, who can't have one without the other, but without

26:26.000 --> 26:32.880
there being any intervening boundary. They nonetheless remain distinct as opposites. This

26:32.880 --> 26:38.240
idea of complementarity is foundational in nature. It's foundational certainly in

26:38.240 --> 26:44.000
everything in modern physics. I would say in morality and I would say in spirituality.

26:45.440 --> 26:51.840
So, for example, to turn one's back on the parts, the work that the left hemisphere brings forward

26:51.840 --> 26:59.920
for us, and except only the whole, the work that the right hemisphere gives us, is not to get back

26:59.920 --> 27:06.560
to wholeness, because the whole is never an annihilation, but rather a subsumption of the

27:06.560 --> 27:13.920
parts. The true whole exists precisely in this relationship, the tension between parts and an

27:13.920 --> 27:26.240
apparent whole. Moreover, morally speaking, every angel has his devil. And I wish I could show you,

27:26.880 --> 27:34.720
but for copyright reasons, I don't dare show you, a wonderful image by MC Escher called Circle Limit 4,

27:36.320 --> 27:40.640
often called Angels and Devils. If you look that up, that up, perhaps later, I hope,

27:41.360 --> 27:45.280
you will see why it is a particularly beautiful illustration of what I'm talking about.

27:46.880 --> 27:52.960
But you know, in our society we are beset, aren't we, by what we call paradoxes. We pursue happiness

27:52.960 --> 27:59.680
and become measurably less happy over time. We privilege autonomy and end up bound by rules

27:59.680 --> 28:04.640
to which we never assented and more spied on than any people since the beginning of time.

28:05.360 --> 28:10.400
We pursue leisure through technology and discover that the average working day is longer than

28:10.400 --> 28:17.680
ever and that we have less time than we had before. The means to our ends are ever more available,

28:17.680 --> 28:22.720
while we have less sense of what our end should be or whether there's purpose in anything at all.

28:23.920 --> 28:29.120
Economists carefully model and monitor the financial markets in order to avoid any future

28:29.120 --> 28:36.240
crash. They promptly crash. We are so eager that all scientific research results in positive findings

28:36.240 --> 28:41.440
that has become progressively less adventurous and more predictable and therefore discovers less

28:41.440 --> 28:47.280
and less that is a truly significant advance in scientific thinking. We grossly misconceive the

28:47.280 --> 28:54.480
nature of study in the humanities as utilitarian in order to get value for money and thus render it

28:54.480 --> 29:01.600
pointless and in this form certainly a waste of resource. We improve education by dictating

29:01.600 --> 29:07.440
curricula and focusing on exam results to the point where free thinking, arguably an overarching

29:07.440 --> 29:14.400
goal of true education, is discouraged. In our universities many students are in any case so

29:14.400 --> 29:19.520
frightened that the truth might turn out not to conform to their theoretical model that they

29:19.520 --> 29:24.800
demand to be protected from discussions that threaten to examine the model critically

29:24.800 --> 29:30.080
and their teachers who should know better in a serious dereliction of duty collude.

29:31.600 --> 29:37.760
We over sanitize and cause vulnerability to infection. We overuse antibiotics leading to

29:37.760 --> 29:46.400
super bacteria that no antibiotic can kill. We make drugs illegal to protect society and while

29:46.400 --> 29:52.640
failing comprehensively to control the use of drugs we create a fertile field for crime. We

29:52.640 --> 29:58.400
protect children in such a way that they cannot cope with let alone relish uncertainty or risk

29:58.400 --> 30:03.600
and are rendered vulnerable. The left hemisphere's motivation is control

30:03.600 --> 30:09.600
and its means of achieving it alarmingly linear as though it could see only one of the arrows

30:09.600 --> 30:16.960
in a vastly complex network of recursive interactions at any one time which is all it can.

30:20.960 --> 30:24.800
I want to mention something called hormesis it's a term from chemistry

30:24.800 --> 30:30.000
and what it refers to is a familiar phenomenon which a very small amount of something may have

30:30.000 --> 30:38.240
highly beneficial effects but a larger amount may kill you. Some scientists were rather puzzled

30:38.880 --> 30:43.760
when they were trying to account for what happened in an experimental environment called

30:43.760 --> 30:51.920
biosphere 2 which is a very large covered sheltered environment in which plants and trees are given

30:51.920 --> 30:57.760
what are seen as an optimal environment in which to flourish and it was discovered that trees

30:58.800 --> 31:05.520
rarely reached maturity before they fell over. Why was this? Well it turns out that actually being

31:05.520 --> 31:13.200
subject to stressful winds is extremely important for the growth and survival of a tree. It produces

31:13.200 --> 31:20.400
something called stress wood which is the core strength of it. As so often Nietzsche got there

31:20.400 --> 31:27.360
a long time before the 21st century scientists examined the lives he said of the best and most

31:27.360 --> 31:32.320
fruitful people and peoples and asked yourself whether a tree which is supposed to grow to a

31:32.320 --> 31:39.760
proud height could do without bad weather and storms. Whether misfortune and external resistance

31:39.760 --> 31:46.880
whether any kinds of hatred jealousy stubbornness mistrust hardness greed and violence do not belong

31:46.880 --> 31:53.440
to the favorable conditions without which any great growth even of virtue is scarcely possible.

31:54.480 --> 32:03.040
And there are many examples in medicine digitalis atropine arsenic will be familiar to doctors and

32:03.040 --> 32:12.640
to some patients. Even radiation in small amounts can suppress tumors relative to creatures who are

32:12.880 --> 32:19.920
raised in an environment in highly free of radiation and a deadly poison called dioxin

32:19.920 --> 32:28.000
in very small amounts can heal tumors. I am not by any means please understand me excusing

32:28.000 --> 32:34.080
in any sense the pollution of our environment my whole point is that these are highly toxic

32:34.080 --> 32:41.520
but that in very small amounts they may be beneficial. Changing of context completely changes

32:41.520 --> 32:47.200
what can be said to be true so that something can come to mean its opposite. There are many

32:47.840 --> 32:55.360
profound examples of this from religious text and from poetry but one I rather like just because

32:55.360 --> 33:02.400
it's so every day is the sizes of cereal packets you know I think in America there are four sizes

33:02.400 --> 33:08.720
of cereal packets there's one called jumbo which means very large then there's one called economy

33:08.720 --> 33:17.040
which means large then there's one called family which means medium then finally there's one called

33:17.040 --> 33:26.160
large which means small. Things change depending on the context which is why taking a statement

33:26.160 --> 33:30.640
that anyone says out of the context without everything else that said or even without the

33:30.640 --> 33:36.960
tone of voice which may betray a completely different meaning is so treacherous. From any

33:36.960 --> 33:45.120
one standpoint also only a part of the picture is possible and I say that not because as it where

33:45.120 --> 33:49.920
we might be able to get around this if we had some other way of doing things intrinsically

33:49.920 --> 33:57.680
it is possible only to take in one part of a reality at a time and what I conceive objectivity

33:57.680 --> 34:03.840
to be is not to affect some cast of mind in which there is nothing human that would be very strange

34:04.480 --> 34:10.960
way of looking at things that wouldn't be particularly rich in its ability to reveal

34:10.960 --> 34:16.800
the nature of the thing but to instead see as many points of view on something as you possibly can

34:18.880 --> 34:24.880
and that's part of what Whitehead meant talking about half truths and you are needing the other

34:24.880 --> 34:31.360
half of the truth to see it from one side only is not to have seen it and in fact in Japanese there's

34:32.240 --> 34:39.440
a term Tambankan for a person who only sees one side and what it means is somebody who carries

34:39.440 --> 34:44.240
a board on their shoulder so that they only see with one half of their field of vision.

34:45.760 --> 34:51.360
Also another Japanese image comes to mind that I love one of the greatest of all the Zen gardens

34:51.360 --> 34:58.240
Riyanji has I think 15 rocks in it but it is so constructed that there is no place in the garden

34:58.240 --> 35:03.600
from which you can see all of the rocks the most you can see at any one point would be 14

35:05.360 --> 35:11.440
and in our world I'm afraid we neglect often the dark side everything has its dark side

35:12.560 --> 35:19.040
that is really a central message to be taken home there is nothing so good that it cannot

35:20.720 --> 35:26.320
have negative consequences and indeed there is nothing so bad that it cannot

35:27.120 --> 35:34.480
occasionally give rise to good. Neglecting this unfortunately leads to extremism as a psychiatrist

35:34.480 --> 35:38.480
one of the hardest things to deal with is a person who believes they should be

35:40.160 --> 35:46.480
perfect and therefore in denial about their imperfections these people become very stressed

35:46.480 --> 35:52.720
anxious and unhappy and actually spread anxiety and unhappiness around them in their families

35:52.720 --> 35:57.840
trying to control everything for good instead of realizing that actually they can't do that

35:57.840 --> 36:04.080
and that they would be better to exercise a wise ability to move flexibly with the flow.

36:05.760 --> 36:16.480
I've talked a bit about a straight line the German great highly eccentric painter and architect

36:16.480 --> 36:24.160
actually sorry I did him a well not an injustice but I made an error there calling him German he

36:24.160 --> 36:31.680
was in fact an Austrian Friedensreich Hundertwasser wrote in 1953 I realized that the straight line

36:31.680 --> 36:37.840
leads to the downfall of mankind but the straight line has become an absolute tyranny the straight

36:37.840 --> 36:42.880
line is something cowardly drawn with a rule without thought or feeling it is a line which

36:42.880 --> 36:50.160
does not exist in nature and that line is the rotten foundation of our doomed civilization

36:50.160 --> 36:56.320
the straight line is atheistic and immoral it is the only sterile line the only line which

36:56.320 --> 37:02.800
does not suit man as the image of god the straight line is the forbidden fruit the straight line is

37:02.800 --> 37:09.680
the curse of our civilization any design undertaken with the straight line will be stillborn today

37:09.760 --> 37:15.680
we are witnessing the triumph of rationalist know-how and yet at the same time we find ourselves

37:15.680 --> 37:23.360
confronted with emptiness an aesthetic void a desert of uniformity criminal sterility loss

37:23.360 --> 37:31.360
of creative power even creativity is prefabricated we have become impotent we are no longer able

37:31.360 --> 37:43.680
to create that is our real illiteracy well he certainly put it like it is and I think

37:43.680 --> 37:49.280
it's a very fine piece of writing it's not his only words on this topic but I like to put this

37:49.280 --> 37:54.240
together with something communicated to me personally by a member of the Swiss parliament

37:54.240 --> 38:01.920
Lukas Fiertz who is a founding member of the Green Party in Switzerland who recalled a meeting

38:01.920 --> 38:09.360
as a boy with his neighbor Carl Gustav Jung and in the course of conversation Jung told us says

38:10.080 --> 38:17.280
Lukas Fiertz about his encounter with a Pueblo chief whose name was Mountain Lake the chief

38:17.280 --> 38:24.800
told him that the white man was doomed when asked why the chief took both hands before his eyes and

38:24.800 --> 38:31.040
Jung imitating the gesture moved the outstretched index fingers convergingly towards one point

38:31.040 --> 38:38.000
before him saying because the white man looks only at one point excluding all other aspects

38:39.440 --> 38:45.680
many years later dr. Fiertz who's a physician recalls that a significant adversary of the

38:45.760 --> 38:50.960
Green Party movement was a successful industrialist and self-made billionaire

38:52.560 --> 38:58.480
I asked him what in his view was the reason for his incredible entrepreneurial and political

38:58.480 --> 39:05.280
success he took both hands before his eyes and moved the outstretched index fingers convergingly

39:05.280 --> 39:12.160
towards one point before him saying because I am able to concentrate on only one point excluding

39:12.160 --> 39:19.360
all other aspects I remember that I had to swallow hard two or three times so as not to say anything

39:22.640 --> 39:28.560
so some reflections on this perfect linearity and the structure of reality

39:31.600 --> 39:38.400
William Blake thought that there even must be sorrow in heaven if there was to be joy

39:39.360 --> 39:42.880
and in a well-known poem he wrote it is right that it should be so

39:43.440 --> 39:51.040
man was made for joy and woe joy and woe are woven fine a clothing for the soul divine

39:51.760 --> 39:57.120
under every grief and pine runs a joy with silken twine

39:57.120 --> 40:08.000
perfection can constitute a flaw in traditional chinese houses the last three

40:08.000 --> 40:13.680
tiles are always left off the roof because the saying is even heaven is not perfect

40:14.800 --> 40:20.160
and in oriental rug making there is something called the imperfect stitch which is deliberately

40:21.120 --> 40:30.000
lacking my first book against criticism was in a way a description of a strange phenomenon

40:30.000 --> 40:35.840
why it is that when you start taking apart the qualities of analyzing the greatness of

40:35.840 --> 40:42.640
a great literary figure you end up with a handful of things that are in themselves imperfections

40:42.640 --> 40:47.360
and yet they put them together they do not in any way account for the greatness of the individual

40:48.160 --> 40:51.200
uh i wrote about three of them in that book in particular

40:52.240 --> 40:58.800
one the essayist and general philosopher and thinker sam johnson then the novelist lauren

40:58.800 --> 41:08.960
stern and then the poet william wordsworth in physics we again have both a combination

41:09.520 --> 41:14.320
of order with disorder and it wouldn't be good to have just one without the other

41:15.200 --> 41:22.800
as david oliver says a physicist nature is neither inevitably random nor completely lawful

41:22.800 --> 41:30.960
and predictable quantum spontaneity is only one half the story the other half is the regularity

41:31.920 --> 41:38.560
and that what's often called the edge of chaos is terribly important existence coexistence of

41:38.560 --> 41:46.080
order with disorder the critic and poet william empson wrote extremely often in dealing with

41:46.080 --> 41:52.320
the world one arrives at two ideas or ways of dealing with things which both work and are needed

41:52.320 --> 41:58.320
but which entirely contradict one another and we all experienced this don't be at every level

41:58.320 --> 42:05.440
from the most innocently trivial uh or least trivial seeming to the most sublime we need

42:05.440 --> 42:14.320
universality and particularity precision and flexibility restriction and openness freedom

42:14.320 --> 42:24.320
and constraint simultaneously everything flows from the pairing we as we say lose ourselves

42:24.320 --> 42:32.560
and consequently find ourselves in music dance or contemplation of a beautiful painting or landscape

42:36.240 --> 42:41.360
there is an innocence the other side of experience and knowledge the other side of

42:41.360 --> 42:48.640
knowing a wisdom the other side of folly which is not really its opposite the only simplicity

42:48.640 --> 42:54.960
for which i would give a straw said that rather down to earth jurist oliver wendell holmes is

42:54.960 --> 43:02.000
that which is on the other side of the complex not that which has never divided and joseph

43:02.000 --> 43:08.880
camber writes i think there are three states of being one is the innocent expression of nature

43:09.600 --> 43:16.080
another is when you pause analyze think about it then having analyzed there comes a state in

43:16.080 --> 43:23.280
which you're able to live as nature again but with more competence more control more flexibility

43:23.280 --> 43:29.280
that to me summarizes the proper relationship between the right and the left hemisphere the right

43:29.280 --> 43:36.960
seeing the initial hole the left uh taking it apart in certain ways but crucially not ending

43:36.960 --> 43:44.560
there but giving it back to the right hemisphere that can understand it now in an enriched unfolded

43:44.560 --> 43:53.600
hole according to jung the grand plan on which the unconscious life of the psyche is constructed is so

43:54.320 --> 44:01.120
inaccessible to our understanding that we can never know what evil way not evil may not be necessary

44:01.120 --> 44:07.200
in order to produce good by what he called enantiadromia which basically means the tendency of

44:07.200 --> 44:15.120
things to change into their opposites and what good may very possibly lead to evil a very striking

44:15.120 --> 44:23.920
example from the natural sphere is the concept of a keystone keystone species in yellowstone park

44:24.960 --> 44:36.240
the wolves were more or less eliminated in the 1930s the uh ecosphere as we now say deteriorated

44:36.800 --> 44:43.600
the number of elk dwindled the number of beaver dwindled the number of willow trees dwindled

44:44.240 --> 44:50.480
and then it was decided that actually the wolves played a very important part and they were

44:50.480 --> 44:55.760
reintroduced and since they were reintroduced there are more elk there are more beavers and there are

44:55.760 --> 45:01.360
more willows it sounds paradoxical but the thing is that the presence of the predator keeps the

45:01.360 --> 45:08.400
elk's moving so they don't overgraze and destroy the landscape they move and flourish and because

45:08.480 --> 45:14.240
the the trees flourish and they're no longer eaten up by the elk the beavers which need the trees

45:14.240 --> 45:20.320
come back and flourish and so on and there are many many examples of this in nature where what

45:20.320 --> 45:31.840
looks like the evil predator is in fact the key to life so instead of a um a linear model I would

45:31.840 --> 45:39.920
prefer one of circularity or to modify that of a spiral the circle simply comes back to the same

45:39.920 --> 45:46.800
place and is static a spiral is constantly moving and changing and as you come back around a loop

45:46.800 --> 45:52.480
of the spiral you seem to be at the same place you were before but you're not actually you're

45:52.480 --> 45:57.920
above it and you see what it was you thought you knew when you were there before but you don't

45:57.920 --> 46:03.200
yet anticipate what you will know when you go on yet another loop of the spiral and come back to the

46:03.760 --> 46:09.600
cognate point again on a higher loop and what I particularly like about the spiral is images

46:09.600 --> 46:16.080
when you look down its axis it images the circularity but when you look at it from the side it images

46:16.080 --> 46:24.800
the linearity. Empedocles who was another great uh pre-socratic philosopher thought there were two

46:24.800 --> 46:31.680
opposing and equal forces that gave rise to everything love phylotes that is and strife

46:31.680 --> 46:39.280
naikot in the presence of love only or strife only nothing could exist these forces for union and for

46:39.280 --> 46:44.720
division according to empedocles are present in the very stuff of all things not just in their

46:44.720 --> 46:53.200
ultimate origin and they're imaged as a circle not just as a straight line the idea of complementarity

46:55.040 --> 47:01.840
coming back to the parts and and the whole again recognizes the nature of the earth's true essence

47:02.720 --> 47:09.680
this was something particularly well expressed by the scientist and philosopher shelling

47:10.320 --> 47:16.720
who I have come more and more greatly to honor and admire early 19th late 18th early 19th

47:16.720 --> 47:22.320
German philosophy he says this about the relationship between the one and the many between

47:22.320 --> 47:28.000
the unique and the general which is actually another chapter of my book and could be another talk

47:28.000 --> 47:35.040
but not for tonight only in the bond by virtue of which it eternally asserts its unity as the

47:35.040 --> 47:44.480
multiplicity of its things and conversely this multiplicity as its unity is the earth expressive

47:44.480 --> 47:49.200
of its true essence and it's not that you think that apart from this infinity of things to be

47:49.200 --> 47:54.640
found in the earth there's another one which is the unity of these things rather the same

47:54.640 --> 48:00.320
that is the multiplicity is also the unity and the same that is the unity is also the multiplicity

48:00.320 --> 48:11.440
and so on existence is the conjunction of one with itself as a many and this conjunction of one

48:11.440 --> 48:21.840
and many is a very important topic and this process may sound as though it is linear but

48:21.840 --> 48:29.040
it's not it is a circular process and this depends on an inter-hemispheric relationship

48:29.040 --> 48:38.240
functioning properly in which like the two brothers in the Onondagen myth flint the left

48:38.320 --> 48:44.480
hemisphere representative who actually in the story this was before neuroscience could have

48:44.480 --> 48:53.920
prompted this has the arrow and speech and the two great things about manipulation using the

48:53.920 --> 49:01.840
right hand to grasp things and to use language to pin them down that are the most archetypal I

49:01.840 --> 49:09.280
suppose aspects of the hemisphere these were flint characteristics and they are necessary we're

49:09.280 --> 49:15.760
enriched by language we're enriched by enabling to use a bow and arrow but only in the service of

49:15.760 --> 49:21.600
something greater that the that flint doesn't understand that his brother does understand

49:21.600 --> 49:29.280
and his brother sees that he needs to keep relatively close to the the less wise the less

49:29.280 --> 49:34.160
intelligent brother in order that the work of that brother should be profitable and good

49:34.800 --> 49:42.320
but not too close because he can't afford to lose what it is that he is able to do through

49:42.320 --> 49:53.520
his goodness and his greater wisdom in the cabala a great corpus of Jewish mystical literature

49:54.160 --> 50:00.240
the structure of human faculties takes the form of a tree with a right hand side and

50:00.240 --> 50:06.480
a left hand side very interesting to me humanities task is to integrate them both

50:06.480 --> 50:12.960
laterally and vertically specifically it's held that the mind is made up of two faculties wisdom

50:12.960 --> 50:20.320
hochma on the right which receives the gestalt of a situation in a single flash and understanding

50:20.320 --> 50:27.760
bina opposite it on the left which builds them up in a replicable step by step way this is the

50:27.760 --> 50:33.520
distinction between the right and left hemisphere at least one way of looking at it hochma and bina

50:33.520 --> 50:39.360
are considered two friends who never part because you cannot have one without the other hochma gives

50:39.360 --> 50:45.600
rise to a force for loving fusion with the other while bina gives rise to judgment which is responsible

50:45.600 --> 50:52.160
for setting boundaries and limits their integration is another faculty called dart which is a bit like

50:52.160 --> 50:58.800
Aristotle's phronesis or even software and embodied overarching intuitive capacity to know

50:58.800 --> 51:05.840
what the situation calls for and to do it what is more this tree is a true organism each part

51:05.840 --> 51:14.560
reflected in and qualified by co presence with each of the others so what is united is to be

51:14.560 --> 51:22.480
divided and what divided is to be united this involves cyclical returns it follows from this

51:22.480 --> 51:28.800
cyclical nature that if you go far enough in any one direction you reach not more of what you desired

51:28.800 --> 51:35.120
but it's opposite go east and you eventually reach the west and it follows that both of two

51:35.120 --> 51:41.280
opposites are simultaneously present and need to be so just as east and west are simultaneously

51:41.280 --> 51:49.840
present on the campus and need to be so not just to navigate the world but to have a world to navigate

51:53.440 --> 52:00.160
i finally want to reflect on an asymmetry at the heart of the coincidentia positorum

52:02.480 --> 52:08.160
union and division which i've mentioned a lot in this talk are asymmetrical

52:09.040 --> 52:15.680
the principle for division and the principle for union are both needed but they're needed

52:15.680 --> 52:23.280
to be brought together not divided we need the union of union and division not the division

52:23.280 --> 52:36.480
of union and division and in our thinking today we need not either both and or either or but we

52:36.480 --> 52:50.320
need both both and and either or equally we need not non duality only but we need the non duality

52:50.880 --> 53:01.360
of duality and non duality there's also an asymmetry between symmetry and asymmetry

53:01.360 --> 53:10.800
not just an asymmetry of quality which obviously is but an inequality of value

53:12.240 --> 53:20.240
asymmetry is more important than symmetry actual occurrence of anything involves the

53:20.240 --> 53:28.160
breaking of what is considered in the abstract symmetrical small imbalances differences among

53:28.240 --> 53:35.680
sameness at all levels in nature make it work starting with the initial inequality of matter

53:35.680 --> 53:42.240
and antimatter i'm told by physicists that if there had not been a small inequality between

53:42.240 --> 53:48.560
matter and antimatter at the very beginning of things with the big bang the would have been

53:48.560 --> 53:58.400
nothing at all and this is nicely referred to by two great late 19th century french scientists

53:58.400 --> 54:06.240
one a biologist the other a physicist already in the 1870s Louis Pasteur was writing sentences

54:06.240 --> 54:11.840
that would have anguished his enlightenment forebears the universe as a whole he wrote is

54:11.840 --> 54:18.320
asymmetrical and i've come to believe that life as it has manifest to us is a function of the

54:18.320 --> 54:24.400
asymmetry of the universe without any doubt i repeat of the basic principles of life are

54:24.400 --> 54:30.720
asymmetrical it is because asymmetrical forces of the cosmos preside over their unfolding

54:31.440 --> 54:38.880
life is dominated by the effects of asymmetrical forces whose enveloping cosmic existence we sense

54:38.880 --> 54:45.280
intuitively i would even say that living species are primordially in their structure in their

54:45.360 --> 54:55.920
external forms functions of the cosmic asymmetry and here is the physicist Pierre Curie writing

54:55.920 --> 55:05.120
in 1894 certain elements of symmetry may coexist with certain phenomena but they're not necessary

55:06.000 --> 55:14.000
what is necessary is that certain elements of symmetry do not exist it is asymmetry which

55:14.000 --> 55:22.960
creates the phenomenon and he adds the effects produced may be more symmetrical than their causes

55:24.720 --> 55:29.760
in terms of the hemispheres it's once more not a symmetrical but an asymmetrical arrangement

55:29.760 --> 55:35.200
not just between two dispositions that of the left hemisphere and that of the right towards the world

55:35.200 --> 55:41.520
but between the disposition that sees the two dispositions as an antagonism that must ultimately

55:41.520 --> 55:46.720
lead to the triumph of one and the annihilation of the other that's the left hemisphere's take on

55:46.720 --> 55:53.040
their relation and the disposition that of the right that sees they need to be preserved together

55:53.840 --> 55:59.440
neither being allowed to extinguish the other even though they're not of equal value one the

55:59.440 --> 56:05.680
disposition of the right overarches and takes into account the other much as he grasps the sky with

56:05.680 --> 56:12.400
both hands not just protects flint but enables the fulfillment of flint's contribution

56:15.360 --> 56:19.680
here there's an interesting reflection of William James who I think again is one of the great

56:19.680 --> 56:26.720
philosophers of the last hundred years and more looking back on my own experiences they all

56:26.720 --> 56:32.080
converge towards a kind of insight to which I cannot help ascribing some metaphysical significance

56:32.640 --> 56:38.800
the keynote of it is invariably a reconciliation it is as if the opposites of the world whose

56:38.800 --> 56:44.880
contradictoryness and conflict make all our difficulties and troubles were melted into unity

56:45.600 --> 56:53.440
not only do they as contrasted species belong to one and the same genus but one of the species

56:53.440 --> 57:03.120
the nobler and better one is itself the genus and so soaks up and absorbs its opposite into itself

57:06.080 --> 57:14.400
that we mentioned sisterly and deasterly and on this nature of asymmetry and irregularity

57:14.400 --> 57:22.800
being more important than symmetry and and regularity I just want to mention something about

57:22.800 --> 57:30.400
the movement and rhythm of biological processes these are necessarily not entirely

57:31.040 --> 57:38.080
rhythmical they have a kind of flexibility built into them which for those of you who are

57:38.080 --> 57:45.440
musicians you will recognize as rubato music that is played entirely mechanically loses

57:45.440 --> 57:51.360
its soul and it is the ability to make very small differences in the length of notes

57:53.280 --> 57:58.640
that makes a great musical performance you may not even be aware of them in fact you're not

57:58.640 --> 58:03.840
necessarily aware of them at all but they are what give life and I was very struck when I was

58:05.520 --> 58:12.000
a medical student and I was learning obstetrics on the obstetric board when learned that the

58:12.720 --> 58:18.880
trace of the fetal heart when it became regular this was a medical emergency and you called the

58:18.880 --> 58:28.800
team urgently the when the fetus is thriving the heartbeat has a flexibility and irregularity

58:28.800 --> 58:35.280
that also the adult human heart has if it's functioning properly and this is something also

58:35.280 --> 58:44.960
like half rhyme the sort of yes and no at the same time I'd like to write a book called yes and no

58:45.920 --> 58:54.960
or in a zen saying not always so and I can't resist just quoting because I'm about to conclude

58:55.680 --> 59:05.120
that wonderful poem by Wilfred Owen who used half rhyme so effectively visionary spine chilling poem

59:05.120 --> 59:10.960
called strange meeting in which he imagines encountering the German soldier that he's killed

59:10.960 --> 59:18.000
the other that is not really an other at all and the poem famously ends with the dead soldier's words

59:18.000 --> 59:27.600
to Owen I am the enemy you killed my friend I knew you in this dark for so you frowned yesterday

59:27.600 --> 59:36.400
through me as you jabbed and killed I parried but my hands were loath and cold let us sleep now

59:36.880 --> 59:44.880
those lines couldn't be so great if they had had full rhymes instead of half rhymes

59:46.480 --> 59:51.760
it's interesting by the way that the Russian word for other or different to goi has the same

59:51.760 --> 59:59.120
etymological root as the word drug which means a friend anyway I'm going to just wrap up in

59:59.200 --> 01:00:04.800
some final words so I've argued that at the origin of everything there lies a

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:15.680
coincidence or conjunction of opposites that is profoundly generative indeed necessary for creation

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:21.840
gives rise to all that we know and that this coincidence of opposites is by no means contrary

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:28.000
to reason I've stressed that we must not be tempted left hemisphere fashion to resolve the

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.760
necessary tension by pretending one of the pairs of opposites can safely be dispensed with or is

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:40.400
not real denying the concealed opposite is dangerous the coincidence of opposites does

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:47.040
not compromise their nature as opposites rather they fulfill themselves through one another

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:52.080
at the foundation of everything is this opposition recognized from empedocles to girta

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:58.800
between love and strife we need the union of division and union the union of multiplicity and

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:06.320
unity the left hemisphere needs ultimately to act as servants the right hemisphere since unbridled

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:12.880
the left hemisphere is capable of destroying the world which I believe it is engaged in doing now

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:21.760
and was foretold in the Iroquois legend moreover what we think of as good may conceal much harm

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:27.840
and what we consider harmful may bring something of great value I've suggested two geometrical

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:33.840
images we should be wary of linear models in our attempts to understand the world except at the most

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:40.800
minutely local level and replace straight lines with helices which incorporate an acknowledgement

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:46.640
of the coincidence of opposites with the idea that there's always change and growth not mere

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:52.720
repetition as the image of the circle risks suggesting and just as there's an asymmetry

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:59.120
in the relationship of the hemispheres there's an asymmetry in the coincidencia opositorum

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:05.600
we need not difference in union but the union of the two we need not non-duality but the

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:12.240
non-duality of duality with non-duality and we need not just asymmetry alone or symmetry alone

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:19.520
but the asymmetry that is symmetry and asymmetry taken together and my last words are those of

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:27.920
Rabbi Jonathan Sacks the chief rabbi of Great Britain who died alas recently I heard him by

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:34.720
accident one day on the radio and he told the following short story a holy man is reading the

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:44.480
Talmud and he reads that Rabbi X says that a certain thing is the case and he reads further

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:50.640
and he finds that another equally revered rabbi says that X is absolutely not the case

01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:58.000
in a sort of spiritual turmoil he does what any spiritual man would do he prays to God

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:09.920
which of them is right and God answers both of them are right somewhat exasperated the man says

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:18.000
but what do you mean they can't both be right to which God replies all three of you are right thank

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.760
thank you very much

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:32.560
my goodnessy and what and what a beautifully rich lecture you've just given us I know that

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:38.800
there would be resounding applause from the from the the the very the significant number

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:45.120
we had 150 or so with us here right now people would be there'd be thunderous applause right now

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:52.000
and on top of that there would there would be many many hands raised as the digital hands

01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:02.560
have indeed been raised that was just a splendid not only examination of a very rich philosophical

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:09.040
question but you beautifully brought us in to the very complexity and the unity and the division

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.080
of unity and division that you are the unity of those things that you are seeking to bring about

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:20.480
in us as we were sitting here with you there are many questions here and I have some of my own but

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.480
it's important to say because there have been several people who've asked will this lecture

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:32.560
be available later yes absolutely we'll we'll work the audio in the video in post production and

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:38.640
release it as a podcast and on YouTube so stay stay tuned for that we'll make sure to alert you

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:44.000
if you sign up for our newsletter which you're free to do on our website if you like I also

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.520
want to say very importantly that this is a reflection that emerges from Dr. McGilchrist's

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:55.280
new book the matter with things which will be available if I'm not mistaken on November 9th

01:04:55.280 --> 01:05:00.960
in the United States perhaps sooner in other locales but do pay attention for that announcement

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:09.120
and pick up a copy of this wonderfully rich text when and as you can now there are many questions

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:15.760
here as I say and we could spend our whole lives in a way in this question in a way we

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:25.520
do spend our whole lives in the reality that you have been making manifest to us in this lecture

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:30.960
I mean this is the world this is the this is precisely what we're living in all the time

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.720
and it is in fact I would say also precisely this

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:43.920
insight that in some sense Ralston College as a whole venture aims to help bring about

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:50.880
you know there's a kind of post enlightenment conceit that the only thing we can know so

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:58.720
as far as we can know anything at all is in kind of empirical propositional manner and in a sense

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:05.120
from that standpoint you know beauty or justice or love or indeed properly speaking even truth

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:13.760
itself these are incomprehensible and so your lecture has is bringing about the the kind of

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:20.800
thinking that is necessary to really think about these deepest realities and so my first question

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:29.680
Ian is how must our conception of reason change in order for us to see that a grasp of the unity

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:38.240
of opposites is not incompatible with reason a very very good question thank you Stephen

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:45.440
takes me to another very important point and there are different meanings to the word reason

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:49.680
and in the book I have three chapters on the nature of reason

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:57.120
and it will not surprise you that I am a great fan of reason as I am a great fan of empirical

01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:04.480
science and I do also happen to believe that it's a mistake to try and take empirical science

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:12.800
into areas where it simply has no jurisdiction and to take certain kinds of rationalizing

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:20.320
into areas where it cannot be illuminating but I believe we need to make a distinction between

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:25.040
things that are beyond the grasp of well we need to make two distinctions one is between

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:31.040
things that are beyond the grasp of what people commonly conceive of as reason

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:38.080
and things that are within its grasp and the other distinction is between kinds of reason

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:50.720
on the first one there is nothing irrational about my love for and my defense of a great piece of

01:07:50.720 --> 01:08:00.960
music I often say Schubert C major quintet because increasingly it has come over my life to be

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:05.760
seen as one of the most powerful pieces of music ever written one of the deepest

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:12.480
and yet I cannot in any way rationalize why it works or how it works and if I could I'd

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:17.840
be only talking about a few mechanisms either in the brain or in the structure of harmonics

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:24.640
that would leave the real truth of it what it is doing and what it is untouched so there should be

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:33.360
a word for a realm which is trans-rational or supra-rational and that is I think a concept we

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:43.200
need to take back into our lives much that we value in in nature in art in music in human life in

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:52.720
approach to the sacred is not irrational just because it cannot be stated purely in logical

01:08:52.720 --> 01:09:01.440
terms and the other is a defense of a different kind of reason so in English unfortunately we

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:07.680
don't make much of a distinction but in Greek in Latin and in German there are distinct words for

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:14.400
two kinds of reason one is the carrying out of logical procedures in the way that a computer

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:22.160
could be taught to do and the other is what was always considered the flower of education and the

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:29.920
flower of a civilization the capacity to produce people who were reasonable people my god how

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:36.160
nostalgic that makes me when I look at the world around me and how very few voices I hear

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:42.720
that I can call reasonable voices and what I mean by reasonable are not consumed with hatred

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:50.320
rage misunderstanding malice the ability to take things out of context to understand them in some

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:57.280
purely reduced abstracted way but to put together the fruits of being able to think reasonably

01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:06.640
rationally and and logically together with an understanding of humanity in all its complexity

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:11.840
and that life simply isn't a matter of following certain rules and that the more you know the more

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:17.360
you understand you don't know that's a very different kind of reasoning one that cannot emerge

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:24.320
from a computer but in an age in which everything is increasingly handed over to a system a computerized

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:30.000
system with which we have to interact whatever it is we're doing we are encouraged into a black

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:37.280
and white either or abstracted disembodied decontextualized this is what it is or it isn't

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.480
black and white way of thinking which is the precise opposite the precise opposite of everything

01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:53.200
I've just argued for I am so glad we're recording this um Ian let me uh let me take us back for

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.280
a minute I want to talk a little bit later in our Q&A and there are several questions pertaining to

01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:03.840
education and to sort of the question of what can we do but I want to go back for a minute to

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:12.720
the ancient Greeks because there's just following the pre-socratics that you described in Greek

01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:18.960
history we have the Sophists and one of the things the Sophists do and I think people who are paying

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:26.160
attention to our current intellectual climate will see this move all around them is they their

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:33.280
their expertise is in showing that any particular position is partial that it's insufficient on

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:42.400
its own but then to use that apparent insufficiency to conclude essentially that there is no truth at

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:48.080
all as a protagonist says man is the measure of all things that is to say there is no there is no

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:55.760
coherence to reality itself there is no truth beyond the insufficiency of the particulars and so

01:11:55.760 --> 01:12:04.400
what I'm what I'm wanting to ask you is this is what does all this mean that truth is that rather

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:10.000
than the insufficiency of the particular showing that there is no truth and certainly today the

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.520
claim is that truth itself is just a a mechanism or construct of the will to power that rather than

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:24.880
that that precisely in these particularities in the movement between the opposites is revealed

01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:34.880
uncovered made real made manifest something larger deeper more sovereign than the insufficiency

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:42.960
of the particulars might initially have us believe well you do you do ask the best questions

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:53.040
even again a very difficult one I'll try to answer as economically as I can

01:12:54.240 --> 01:13:02.480
I think the first thing I'd say is behind the title no matter with things is my dissatisfaction

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:10.720
with the way in which we think of everything not just material things which the matter with

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:17.120
things refers to as things we think about reality as a thing we think about truth as a thing

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:23.920
actually interestingly etymologically it begins as a process that involves a relationship between

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:38.480
people and I argue that there is truth there is no one truth there is no one single truth

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.560
and we can never ultimately know the whole of that truth but some things are truer than others

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:50.720
otherwise we wouldn't say anything there'd be no reason for saying anything at all or even getting

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:56.880
out of bed or moving because really everything would be as worthless or pointless or as meaningful

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:01.680
or meaningless as everything else this cannot possibly be the case nobody acts like this

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:11.920
so the problem arises from two positions that I call rot and mumbo rot is the acronym reality

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:17.760
out there that the justice of reality somewhere out there and it's untouched by us and it's

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:24.480
our job to find it and when we do find it it has nothing of us about it the other I call

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:34.640
mumbo which is that reality is made up miraculously by ourselves another acronym and what I'm

01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:45.360
talking about there is the opposite position beloved of some postmodernist that there is no

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:52.320
truth because everybody's truth has its own validity I argue from the very word go and

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:58.080
if people want to find this they will find what are my my comments on it of course we extended

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:02.720
over the entire book which is a very long book but I have something to say about it in the first

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:09.760
ten pages also of volume one of the book and what I'm really emphasizing is that it is neither

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:17.760
a thing in here nor a thing out there but is a relationship a reverberative relationship between

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:25.680
whatever it is I mean by my consciousness and the conscious cosmos outside of what I consider my

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:34.960
consciousness and it's in that coming together of my internal sense of myself with whatever it is

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:42.240
that exists that is apart from me at least never ultimately separate from me but utterly distinct

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:53.360
from me it's in that coming together that we embark on the process of reality of discovering

01:15:53.360 --> 01:16:01.200
reality and the first volume my books in two volumes the first volume is called the ways

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:07.440
to truth so not a suggestion that it is a journey that may never actually be achieved

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:14.560
but it's still an important journey and the second volume is called what then is true

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:20.640
an open question but effectively what I'm doing in the first part of the book is saying what can

01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:26.800
we take as a guide on our journey towards truth I think knowing more about what the brain is

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:34.160
telling us can help that's part one neuroscience and I think epistemology the business of studying

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:43.040
the values of reason science and intuition and imagination their strengths and values

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:48.720
that can tell us when we take those together and look at the cosmos what do we find and what I

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:54.000
suggest in part three which is metaphysics is that we find the cosmos very different from the one

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:00.000
made up of just a heap of bits that we're told is the nature of the universe we find something

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:12.320
that has inherent beauty complexity order a drive has is not alien to us has this paradoxical

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:19.920
structure that I've alluded to partly here and in which time is very real consciousness is very

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:26.160
real foundational indeed an element in the cosmos that cannot be reduced and that values too are

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:36.720
foundational so that's where the whole drift goes my goodness we're never going to get through all

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:42.080
these questions because they're so they're so difficult and I just want to thank everyone who

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:45.520
we do have some time and we're going to get through many of them but I want to thank everyone for

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:50.400
sending your questions and I am going to share these afterwards with Dr. McGilchrist in the event

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:56.720
he should ever find an occasion or wish to undertake he does have a channel in which he

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:02.160
he shares his work called channel McGilchrist and it may be that he will find time to answer some

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:08.560
additional questions there beyond our session today here is here's one from Benedict Ian

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:14.160
he says I'd be interested to hear more on the origins of your understanding of this idea at

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:18.800
what point did the notion of the coincidence of opposites and in particular of the symmetry

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:25.440
and asymmetry first occurred to you and how did this awareness come to you and this may this

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:31.440
question may lead us a bit later to the many questions on what we can do and what forms of

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:37.360
education are adequate to bringing about the reasonable kind of disposition that you were

01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:44.400
describing and praising a moment ago I think that probably like most

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:50.400
of certainly I can only speak for myself but most of the ideas that still

01:18:52.400 --> 01:19:00.080
inspire me intrigue me and draw me onwards to further attempts at understanding they started

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:08.000
in my teens I had a very philosophical education I was very lucky in that respect

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:15.840
and I was taught a number of things as not dogmatically that these were true but they were

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:23.760
the assumptions behind what I was told one would be that a thing and its opposite are you know

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:34.000
irreconcilable and this is an Aristotelian position that's perfectly respectable and another was that

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:40.320
history moves in linear trajectories and I thought no I already thought in my teens no it moves in

01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:45.920
sort of circles or spirals and I thought when you you know one of the things I noticed in politics

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:51.040
was that it was more in common between people on either the extreme left or the extreme right than

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:57.680
there was with people who might be thought of as in a completely different realm in a much more

01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:06.240
moderate realm I now incidentally think that it's hard to get a razor blade between fundamentalist

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:12.640
atheists and fundamentalist theists and that these people share very left hemisphere assumptions

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:17.600
about the nature of the world that are completely foreign to most people who call themselves honest

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:24.320
diagnostics or honest believers but there we go that's for another time but I think that what

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:31.440
it was perceptions like that that bitterness and sweetness often complemented one another

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:38.640
and led into one another that in certain ways pain and pleasure were necessary to one another

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:45.520
that you know that as Blake says contrary is fulfill one another I already was feeling that

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:55.120
experiencing that as a young person and I thought also that the world is not inert and

01:20:55.120 --> 01:21:01.920
unresponsive but something that is responsive essentially that all experience all reality

01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:08.880
is reverberative I can't think of a better word a resonance a coming a responsibility we have a

01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:17.200
responsibility for it and it for us response of course comes from the root of calling to

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:22.720
and calling back and forth so this sound of it this idea of a sound resonance going back and

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:29.440
forwards and a movement reverberation or back and forwards between two things that we thought

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:34.720
of as distinct and perhaps not not not mutually influencing one another was another profound

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:42.480
perception so I think that that together with my rejection of linearity as a useful model for

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:48.880
anything living or anything I experienced and the sense that opposites came here and that when you

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:54.400
pursued one you soon found that you were achieving the opposite of the thing that the very thing you

01:21:54.400 --> 01:22:01.040
thought you were trying to achieve that I noticed in my teens and you know when I look around me

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:09.440
now I'm astonished that people don't see how in pursuing goals that they would call you know

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:16.960
humane goals to do with all kinds of high ideals that the result can be so different from anything

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:25.840
resembling those ideals so there you go famously political systems are founded on

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:34.000
great ideals of liberty equality and fraternity end up to be illiberal unfraternal and unequal

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:39.040
you know I want to ask you want to make this as

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:47.040
concrete in a way as I can one of the things that comes out in the lovely Iroquois

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:55.360
legend that you shared with us to read is that the he grasps the sky with both hands the the

01:22:55.360 --> 01:23:03.760
one figure represents as you write one's higher identity in the midst of action in the world and

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:12.320
what what the fact that we're able to perceive opposites

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:22.720
as we go through time and find our way through them to deeper understanding what that must mean

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:28.880
is that our own subjectivity our own souls our own person hoods whatever we are as entities

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:40.320
in some sense is in the image of or has access to that unity that is both

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:49.280
higher than but also revealed by an in and through division and

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:56.560
so I have it of course we're in big matters here but I have a few questions about that

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.160
and some of these are trying doing my best to gather up the questions that are

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:08.160
wonderfully wonderfully expressed let me say in this Q&A we have 55 questions here

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:14.320
are beautiful deep questions we're really this is really the question in a way of our time

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:25.280
how do we move to a standpoint then which we don't lose ourselves in division and I don't

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:32.400
mean simply culturally we can come to that but I mean ourselves how do we ourselves develop

01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:39.600
habits or practices what are the the the manners and modes according to which we can

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:46.880
recollect or come to the awareness that we are in in the whole

01:24:53.840 --> 01:25:00.800
yes what of course is strange is that we have to talk about that because in most cultures other

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:06.160
than our own modern western one it would seem obvious that we were part of a whole

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:14.160
one of the most difficult things is the concept of the environment to me I reject the term

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:19.840
because it suggests something that is around you but is not you whereas nature is something

01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:23.920
out of which we are born which is what the word nature means something that is giving birth

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:32.160
and back into which we go so being surrounded by nature as well as bringing a host of

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:40.960
health benefits incidentally both physical and psychological and spiritual benefits helps us

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:47.520
see ourselves not as isolated beings as it were skittering around on the repellent surface of an

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:55.120
alien world but actually deeply deeply embedded in a world that has roots and we have roots in it

01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:06.880
music poetry and painting but for me particularly music and poetry

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:14.480
bring us together with other minds and spirits though those of those who made them and those

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:21.440
that we can feel respond to them one of the most rewarding things for me during the first year

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:29.200
of lockdown was that every day for 365 days I read a new poem not one of mine but a poem

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:35.920
I considered a great poem on the internet and I must say I found it very healing myself and a

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:42.000
lot of people wrote to me in very moving terms saying that in this spell of isolation that it made

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:50.320
them feel more together with humanity then I think there is the whole way in which we conceive

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:57.120
what a society is not an agglomeration of atomistic individuals each out to fulfill their

01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:04.880
whatever they can get for themselves and whatever they can make of themselves but to see that only

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:11.680
in the service to society as a whole that what you achieve is only valuable in as much as it

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:18.320
goes back to making a society a better place what you what you want you need of course yourself

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:24.960
we're not saints we need food and we need a lot more in order to to be happy but we don't need

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:32.000
extraordinary amounts of things and in our society our attitudes that our self-esteem

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:38.480
our independence of mind our independence of action that we can do what we like

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:52.000
is is odd historically it's odd and I know from talking to some people from other oriental cultures

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:59.760
that to them this emphasis on self-esteem and self-determination seems literally sick I mean

01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:06.880
that's the word that's been used I mean that's sick and I would like of course as always to

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:14.240
be able to try and see the virtues in um individuation which is very important and I don't

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:19.680
think that oriental cultures negate that at all they they believe it's very important but in the

01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:25.840
service of fulfillment of the whole so once again that force for division that left hemisphere a bit

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:32.560
is incredibly creative and important but in service of a bigger differentiated whole so I see the

01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:38.720
whole business of things coming into being as not splitting apart but rather like some very

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:45.120
enfolded flower imagine the sort of infinitely enfolded infinitely rich flower that had florets

01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:52.800
within florets in some sort of um fractal way and what happened was that they unfolded and within

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.520
them something else unfolded and so on the flower was still a flower the flower had that

01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:04.880
potential but now that potential has been fulfilled and you therefore have togetherness with

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:12.000
and wholeness but at the same time individuation I hope that's a sort of relatively brief gloss on that

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:21.040
yes I want to I want to drive further into the question of what you know if we're if as I think

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:27.920
it's clear we're living in a time of very significant alienation and division I mean

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:32.800
there are all kinds of metrics according to which we can understand that we can see the proofs or

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:41.760
signs of that the the question on many of our questioner's minds is is is what can we do what are

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:49.920
the the the forms of life and culture the institutions the the practices that that that

01:29:51.440 --> 01:30:03.120
bring us or foster the bringing of us both into ourselves more fully precisely by

01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:08.640
awakening us in the way that you're describing to our place within in the whole what are the

01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:13.760
you mentioned of course music and poetry and painting in the in the arts I have the sense

01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:19.440
that some of our questioners are are trying to ask the question of or indeed are asking the

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:25.200
question very explicitly at the big picture where have we gone wrong and what can we rebuild and how

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:35.840
well of course that is the big question an easy one to ask in the very very difficult one to answer

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.200
and

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:50.080
not just in the sense that it's hard to make a prescription but that the very fact of trying

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:56.160
to make a prescription may be the wrong thing to do in that my prescription may close down

01:30:56.160 --> 01:31:01.680
options rather than open them up and what the left hemisphere always wants is to close down on

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:07.840
the certainty whereas the right hemisphere wants to open up into a possibility and I'll just say

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:12.240
it very briefly because people may have heard me say it before but as a psychiatrist one of the

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:16.480
things you learn very early on is you may know exactly what a person needs to do but you must

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:22.640
not tell them not because you're being sort of frustrating but because to begin with you make

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:27.440
the mistake of telling people and they go oh no I can't do that that wouldn't make any sense for me

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:32.720
and then you have to allow them to come to a place where they see for themselves and sometimes

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:37.840
a year or 18 months later they will come to you and say you know I know what it is I need to do

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:43.280
and it's exactly what you told them 18 months ago but so it's no good giving a prescription

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:51.200
because people won't follow it or they will think if there's a prescription I can relax because then

01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:58.000
I do these six bullet points that Dr. McGilchrist has mentioned and phew it's all going to be fine

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.680
again but it isn't all going to be fine again it may be fine but it will never be fine again in the

01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:09.760
same way the world that we are leaving behind cannot be recreated and cannot and must not be

01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:15.760
perpetuated and I often say if we could reverse the poisoning of the oceans the felling of the

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:21.040
forests and the destruction of the ways of life of indigenous people around the world which I very

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:27.040
much hope we can it would all be in vain if we just carry it on being the same dissatisfied

01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:33.280
unhappy isolated neurotic people that we now are looking for stuff to get oh thank god we

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:38.400
haven't destroyed the rainforest that means the world economy won't collapse and the weather

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:44.000
patterns won't be damaging no the reason for not destroying the rainforest is that they are

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:52.160
the most extraordinary expression of what this whole cosmos is about they are a wonder of complexity

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:58.640
and beauty that is valuable in itself not as the left hemisphere always thinks for some utility

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:08.720
of its own so having said that is there anything I can say to indicate ways of going well I'm going

01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:16.080
to say some rather in the tradition of my talk slightly opposite things I think first of all

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:22.400
very obviously that education needs to be much more concerned with things like philosophy

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:30.160
teaching people how to think which is not done by shoving information in and then seeing whether

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:35.760
they've retained it that is the opposite of teaching people how to think one exercise that every

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:42.640
school child every school child should do regularly and shouldn't be allowed to be to leave school

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:48.080
without knowing how to do this is to take any point of view argue forcibly for it and then

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:54.160
immediately turn around and argue more emphatically for the or more convincingly let me say for the

01:33:54.160 --> 01:34:00.400
opposite point of view because every point of view has its pros and its cons and I think that

01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:07.040
yes things like poetry music and so on and history in fact the humanities in general how do we

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:12.720
understand ourselves if we know nothing about our history and not just a caricature version

01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:20.560
of history through a filter that happens to be a set of conceptions and preconceptions we have now

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:26.800
but more broadly as broadly and generously as we can and one of the things about the humanities

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:32.400
is not imposing on it a grid of your own but trying to come to it and see another way of

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:37.280
thinking that other people before you had that may be very different from your own but by no

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:43.600
means stupid and make and seal values that you yourself don't see so all of that I think but

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:50.320
I also think it's very important for education to be rigorous children like to be challenged and

01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:56.080
they do actually need to learn things that are difficult you know perhaps an ancient language

01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:02.800
certainly mathematics they do need to understand good science imaginative science science doesn't

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:10.080
have to be killingly boring in the way that it's so often taught science is a is an adventure and

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:15.360
if science is not taught as an adventure the teachers need to be sacked because it is it's a

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:22.720
wonderful exciting adventure just as exciting as learning poetry and music these things are not at

01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:28.240
war with one another they are part of one another but if we are only soft on ourselves and on our

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:35.760
children our civilization won't survive because there's a sort of prisoner's dilemma here is that

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:40.880
it's okay for us to go oh well we're just going to be very relaxed and we're going to do tai chi and

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:46.800
we you know all of which I you know don't have any problem with and would enrich an education and

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:53.280
doing some mindfulness ought to be part of any school day everybody should learn it but we actually

01:35:53.280 --> 01:36:01.120
also do need to learn some toughness of mind and toughness of body because there are nations in

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:12.800
this world who will aren't just waiting peacefully for you know it's the old story that if you if

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:19.920
you want peace prepare for war now I'm not this is not a remark about our military strategy at all

01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:27.040
it's just saying that we can't afford to be off our guard there's a wonderful book um called um

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:35.520
immoderate greatness by patrick offles it's only 80 pages long and it's considerably the best 80

01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:41.520
pages in terms of bang for buck that you could ever read and it's why all civilizations fail

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:46.720
eventually and often quite quickly and it has six reasons three of them are sort of more or less

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:52.480
environmental ones and to do with the resource issues and the other three are to do with the

01:36:52.480 --> 01:37:02.000
way we stop behaving and the stop thinking and in amongst them is this inability to think the

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.880
way you need to think and act the way you need to act if you're going to defend the civilization

01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:15.840
yes clearly we're dealing with a civilizational matter here and I think it's very important

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:26.640
that we underline that these the truths you're pointing to the unity that transcends and is

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:34.720
made manifest by the opposites these modes of thinking these are not the mere you know

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:41.360
speculations but an uncovering of what is most fundamentally real this is not an exercise

01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:53.600
simply or a uh a kind of trivial mental show but to uncover most rigorously what is most

01:37:53.600 --> 01:38:01.440
profound and animating um on a on a kind of optimistic or questioningly optimistic note

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:08.880
one questioner uh Rania Rania asks beginning with a quote from what you've said many aspects

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:13.840
of our current plight can be related to our complete failure to understand this essential

01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:18.880
truth of opposites end quote that was from the abstract that you kindly circulated and then

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:25.680
the questioner continues but given that we are part of creation slash existence itself is not

01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:32.560
this failure to understand also part of the journey on a deeper plane that is does not the plight

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:38.640
and failure of understanding in itself in and of itself provide an opposite of sorts to actual

01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:43.680
understanding and from what we might say and thus perhaps we might hope that our encounter

01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:50.720
with this opposite of privation and division may precisely be a move towards a recovery of

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:59.840
a deeper higher more sovereign unity well well that's another fabulous question I mean

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:09.360
um they're just coming in thick and fast this is wonderful uh I mean in brief I absolutely agree

01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:17.760
with that um I think one of my themes was that we do not know out of what apparent um

01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:27.200
downturns of fortune something good may come and out of what apparent upturns of fortune

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:35.840
bad may come and I think we've seen and are seeing both so I absolutely agree with that

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:40.720
it's the famous chinese story you know bad luck good luck who knows you can't see what's coming

01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:48.400
down the line as the outcome of a certain particular set of circumstances and I think I go further and

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:53.920
say that actually out of a certain degree of suffering comes a degree of wisdom it's not

01:39:53.920 --> 01:40:00.880
a popular point of view these days and there is I certainly not an argument for in any sense

01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:06.720
increasing or not doing what you can to minimize suffering don't misunderstand me but nonetheless

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:13.280
suffering will exist and life has a lot of suffering in it for anybody who's at all um alive to

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:20.000
the suffering of others for a start but out of it some good can come and that's a

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:26.800
profound truth in all spiritual traditions also I think that not knowing is very important

01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:36.080
a sense of perplexity a sense of I really don't understand this not just because I'm not bright

01:40:36.080 --> 01:40:43.840
enough to but because actually this is something that is beyond the understanding of any single

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:51.680
human individual at this point is a very helpful point of view and I argue in the second part of

01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:59.760
the book particularly for the wisdom which is hardly a new thing to anyone who understands the

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:08.160
wisdom traditions of China and of India and Japan and the Far East in general

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:15.840
the wisdom of unknowing and the wisdom of not doing I mean in a way a lot of the questions

01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:20.720
are going so what do we what do we do you know and I would say well actually one of the first

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:25.600
things to do and actually this is true of talking to a psychiatric patient is well have you thought

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:29.920
of trying not doing all the things that you currently are doing because they're not making

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:38.320
things better are they and the image that I think is useful here is because we think we

01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:42.960
make everything happen this is the left hemisphere talking it is the one that makes things happen it

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:50.880
has an agenda it makes things accord to its will but in fact very little in life can be made to

01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:59.280
accord to your will again all the wise philosophers and sages have said to this said this the secret

01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:04.640
of happiness and fulfilment in life is not trying to force the world to your will but according

01:42:04.640 --> 01:42:11.200
your will to the world and learning how to as it were surf the waves rather than stand there and

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:19.200
be smashed to pieces by them so the image that helps me is that of a gardener does a gardener

01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:27.680
make a plant grow absolutely not a gardener can either make everything as beneficial as it can

01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:37.440
for that plant to grow to foster the flourishing of the plant or it can stifle the plant those are

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:42.960
the options but they can't make the plant grow so when people are talking about so what do we do

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:47.520
how do we make the right human beings well the first thing is to stop doing a lot of what we're

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:53.600
doing now and listen listen in the space I mean one of the ways to understand things is to stop

01:42:54.560 --> 01:43:00.080
constantly holding forth I'm sorry I mean by the nature of this thing I'm spending a lot of time

01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:06.080
holding forth right now but one of the things I try to build into my days is is listening sitting

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:13.920
listening and so I don't think we do enough of that it's not a passive process it's what I call

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:20.320
active passivity it's putting yourself in a position of readiness receptiveness

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:26.160
and often you understand an answer to what needs to be done at this point when you do that whereas

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:31.600
if you carry on arguing what in the Oriental tradition is called monkey mind chattering away

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:38.000
about what we must do you missus all together so once again it's not that we need to do nothing

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:43.040
and that we know nothing but it's that we need to combine our knowingness with unknowingness

01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:50.640
and we need to combine our idea of action with a kind of active passivity

01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:57.040
again the conjunction of opposites is important yes and certainly in for example the play by

01:43:57.040 --> 01:44:04.000
Sophocles, Oedipus Rex in a way that whole play is about the tragedy of what happens when we assume

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:11.440
that what we think we know is absolute and in a way that is related to this next question

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:18.720
from Elizabeth about the pain and alienation of our moment she asks do you think the suicide

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:24.320
crisis amongst young people is partially a result of discouraging creative and critical

01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:30.160
thinking in the school system thereby imprisoning them in the no exit left brain

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.760
yes again I'm sorry I don't always say to every question what a wonderful question but it is

01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:48.160
we're just getting all the important questions um I mean obviously in part I would it is part

01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:59.840
of the answer yes the undoubtedly the case um however that epidemic of suicide and the underlying

01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:09.440
angst depression despair emptiness boredom that seemed to characterize

01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:18.800
the world that young people are inheriting has many causes and really one way of looking at my

01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:25.120
book the matter with things is I'm trying to say well what is the matter with things

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:33.120
um and one is this view that we are nothing but I talk about the school of nothing but

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:38.400
in which you know people say oh it's nothing but or we're nothing but and so on this is always

01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:44.000
fallacious it's always um hiding a piece of shoddy thinking because nothing is ever nothing but

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:52.560
anything else um however um I think it comes from many causes I think all the things that

01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:59.840
what we essentially need is meaning a life without meaning is not a worth living it's not

01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:09.280
worth life worth living um and I want to get rid of one misconception right away this doesn't

01:46:09.280 --> 01:46:14.720
mean that we should invent meaning it means that we should discover meaning meaning is there

01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:21.360
all right beauty is there all right complexity is there all right purpose is there I argue

01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:27.040
and I can't have time to argue that but I do in the book all right they're there

01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:38.400
but it is our task to respond to them to see them and to incorporate them and when we do

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:47.680
life becomes rich we start to flourish society starts to flourish when we don't the opposite

01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:56.160
of all those things is the case and what has very much struck me and I referred to one of these

01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:02.800
in the end of the master and his emissary is the effect of social cohesion so belonging to

01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:08.720
a cohesive social group which is not just a group of people a bubble sphere on the internet that

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:16.080
just happened to share opinions but a living group of people who are able hard at the moment I know

01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:24.320
but to share their lives you know I refer to the research on close Italian communities in the east

01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:30.720
coast of America where communities carried on the ways of life that they brought from Italy

01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:35.920
in which they they had they did all kinds of things that were very bad for their health like

01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:42.560
eat fatty food drink loads smoke loads not take a huge amount of exercise and they turned out to have

01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:48.160
lower rates of heart disease and so on and very much happier than the rest of the population

01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:54.960
and why was this because they had huge what's called social capital social belonging they

01:47:54.960 --> 01:48:01.760
they all knew where they belong in society that's the first the second is belonging in nature and

01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:06.720
we've done everything we can to alienate ourselves from nature to treat it as a resource that is to

01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:14.640
be exploited and many of us don't live surrounded by nature sadly I mean it's have no choice other

01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:21.600
than to live in this dispossessed concrete world but that that research on this is massive makes a

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:31.360
huge difference to cognitive ability to memory but also to sense of happiness and anxiety to

01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:41.520
sense of worth and to behavior and the third one surprise surprise is spirituality is believing

01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:53.600
in a spiritual world and preferably being actively involved in the community that

01:48:53.600 --> 01:49:00.560
worship together so these three things are now rather rare in our world and where they exist

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:06.080
they do help but if you really wanted to make a totally miserable world what you'd do is take

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:11.280
people as far away from the natural world as possible and surround them by by machines and

01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:18.400
virtuality you would disrupt society set individual against individual and say everybody has a right

01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:24.240
to do whatever they want to do quite regardless of what might be good for the well-being of a

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:29.600
community in the society and you tell people that religion was all rotten that essentially they

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:33.440
didn't mean anything the world didn't mean anything and the sooner it was over the better

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:40.240
if you do that you'll make a very very unhappy world and the evidence is that we are I'll finish

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:46.000
with just one thing I have to mention because it's so staggering research by American psychologist

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Jean Twenge on adolescence between the 1930s and now is based on the same test being administered

01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:01.280
in the same words to the same age group over that period of over 70 years so it's not the

01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:07.280
retrospective scope and open to interpretation they just ask them the same questions about how

01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:13.280
happy they were how anxious they were etc etc there's quite a lot of these questions and what it

01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:21.360
found was that anxiety depression loneliness and a sense of the worthlessness of life was five to

01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:28.880
eight times higher in 2007 than it had been in 1930 so for all the improvements that we

01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:33.840
think we've brought about in our world where everybody must be much happier now people are

01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:40.240
not much happier now that should stop us thinking and it's not five to eight percent higher which

01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:44.320
would be kind of significant it's five to eight times as many

01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:53.040
she's there's such deep matters you know I I know our time is is short I want to ask you

01:50:53.040 --> 01:51:01.760
just a couple of final questions and one of them I want to begin just by reading back this lovely

01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:09.040
line of of hurtle and that you've given us in the reading the heart's wave would never have

01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:16.400
risen up so beautifully in its cloud of spray and become spirit were it not for the grim old

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:26.240
cliff of destiny standing in its way we have a questioner who is asking about love

01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:33.440
it does love show away and if I can try to put this together what I

01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:36.240
want to ask is

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:47.040
first you know love in our own personal you know in our lives you know the lives in which we

01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:54.000
encounter love this does have to do with the unity of the opposites you know we that's what

01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:02.880
forgiveness is is the overcoming in a way of an opposite it's the the the holding on to someone

01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:04.880
to

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:16.640
to discover in that relationship and in them and for them to discover in themselves a

01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:27.280
a beauty a unity that abides and that perhaps becomes more beautiful in and through the the

01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:33.360
the suffering or division or difficulty or hardness of life and

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:43.120
and yet I I think one thing that many people struggle with the alienation the the sense of

01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:56.240
sadness of loneliness somehow at a deep level psychologically that's giving up on belief that

01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:08.000
they that they are loved that they have in themselves a abiding

01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:16.480
hole that they are they are connected with a treads call it a transcendent hole that is

01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:22.640
manifest in themselves but that they something very deep in the nature of things has their back

01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:30.080
and so I'm wondering if you would say something about love as we move towards concluding

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:42.080
yes well of course it's not everybody's gift to be able to feel that they are loved

01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:50.000
or have the capacity of love or that there is a something that has their back and the

01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:57.920
the utter terribleness of depression which is something of which I have too much personal

01:53:57.920 --> 01:54:03.920
experience and of which I've seen so much over 40 years of trying to help other people with it

01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:11.520
is that you lose the sense that you have any of the things that normally make life worth living

01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:19.920
it's so terrible that it can well induce despair so

01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:28.960
obviously that is a pathological state but I'm just saying that to help anybody who's listening

01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:37.600
who doesn't feel that comfortable feeling that they are not alone in that and that it can be

01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:44.720
got through and that coming through it can hard as it may seem also be part of enrichment

01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:52.880
which actually oddly relates to the grim cliff of destiny in a way that your spirit grows through

01:54:52.880 --> 01:55:00.720
overcoming things it can be crushed and never recover for some people and that of course is

01:55:00.720 --> 01:55:08.400
a terrible tragedy what you do with your spirit what you do with the oppositions the resistance

01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:16.080
of which life largely consists is our business it's each person's business what they do with

01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:23.280
that and how they respond to it and I'm all too aware how very very difficult it is so

01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:30.320
I wouldn't wish to preach in any sense but if it's possible to get to a position where you

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:41.840
can see that love is not annihilated by suffering but often actually incorporate suffering and heal

01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:49.280
suffering but it's never going to be devoid of suffering then you've reached a position of

01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:54.560
considerable wisdom and you've said a couple are a kind of opposites and I know what you're

01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:01.920
getting at but of course they're not really opposites in a bad way that they're individually

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:08.560
separate beings but they're also part of one something which is the coming together of them

01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:15.280
and there I suppose the image that I would leave people with is like two heavenly bodies that are

01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:22.080
orbiting one another and what you don't want is them to be so alien that they fly off into space

01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:28.960
but what you don't want either is for them to be so sucked into one another's gravitation

01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:36.480
that their orbits collapse and they crash together and there are couples who become as we say

01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:43.680
in the trade fused and this is usually not a good sign and the relationship rarely survives

01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:51.200
there needs to be a healthful distance but that distance doesn't mean alienation just as

01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:58.960
distinction doesn't mean separation if we could only get those distinctions right in our own minds

01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:07.280
then many many good vivifying things would follow so let me leave it at that but love I mean is

01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:15.760
when I talk about these things and I talk about the union of things the ultimate forces it seems

01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:24.880
to me that we know of our gravity and love and these are forces that that there are opposite

01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:32.480
forces to them that cause other movements but that they are what gives the structure the

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:41.120
complexity the beauty the shape the order to everything and stop division triumphing over union

01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:51.120
in the end that unifying force is more powerful than its opposite I don't duck the question of

01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:57.440
the existence of evil because I think it's it's really having your cake and eat it to say there

01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:02.640
is good but there is no evil I mean if there's a conjunction of opposites then there will be

01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:11.120
and no religion tells you that everything is just fine and everything is good and there is no

01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:19.840
suffering and and so on and Jesus himself didn't pray that we should all just not be quite as bad

01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:25.760
but played for deliverance from evil I mean that those are the very words of the Lord's prayer

01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:31.840
if they mean anything it means that there is some counterbalancing force I personally believe that

01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:38.960
but I also believe in the same spirit that I've said everything tonight that there is an asymmetry

01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:44.400
and I argue about that much greater length of course in a very long chapter in the book which

01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:50.160
is like a short book itself on the sense of the sacred but there I would say that in the end it

01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:57.600
is love that triumphs it is love that holds the day and it is love that grounds the cosmos

01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:08.640
well those are words I think on which we should conclude today in and in gratitude I

01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:18.880
just want to return to your image of the of the spiral and seems that these are weighty but also

01:59:18.880 --> 01:59:24.880
exciting times that we are living in you talked about the way in which the

01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:33.760
temporal and eternal come together the universal and the particular in a certain sense the universal

01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:41.920
has its life only in the particulars and what I want to thank you for on behalf of all of those

01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:47.440
who've been with us today and who and the many who will will will listen to your lecture later online

01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:58.320
is the way that you have enlightened us to embrace our own particularity and to be open to it

01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:08.720
as a site of revelation it's been a very very beautiful time of discussion and illumination Ian

02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:16.720
thank you very much thank you thank you very much Stephen and thank you all of you for listening

02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:21.360
and for such very good questions I will be sure to send you with the rest of these

02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:28.960
magnificent questions your way as soon as as soon as we conclude that is all for now everyone thank you bye
