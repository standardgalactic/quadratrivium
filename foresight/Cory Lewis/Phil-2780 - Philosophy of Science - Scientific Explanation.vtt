WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.160
Okay, so welcome back. Right, so we've kind of finished a broad arc in this

00:08.160 --> 00:12.800
course that I was kind of setting up from the beginning and finished with our

00:12.800 --> 00:18.960
discussion of social construction, broadly trying to motivate the idea that

00:18.960 --> 00:24.400
there's both values influence on science, especially in the sense of deciding

00:24.400 --> 00:29.560
which questions we ask and how we ask them, but that nonetheless science can

00:29.560 --> 00:34.920
come up with reliable and in some sense objective knowledge in the sense that

00:34.920 --> 00:39.160
it's at least intersubjectively reliable. So that was kind of the point of that

00:39.160 --> 00:45.400
the course so far. We're going to shift gears a little bit now, so the rest of

00:45.400 --> 00:50.520
the course is basically just taking a look at a couple of various issues in

00:50.520 --> 00:55.240
philosophy of science. Today we're going to shift to doing more philosophy-ish

00:55.320 --> 00:59.960
philosophy, so less. We've been doing a kind of integrated history and philosophy

00:59.960 --> 01:04.680
of science largely for the course, so lots of interest in actual scientific

01:04.680 --> 01:08.600
practice and that sort of thing. Now at least today we're going to start talking

01:08.600 --> 01:12.760
about kind of more pure philosophy of science, so we're going to take a step

01:12.760 --> 01:17.080
back historically, start talking about stuff that happened in the 40s in

01:17.080 --> 01:21.960
philosophy of science and move on to more modern stuff. Specifically we're going

01:21.960 --> 01:25.640
to start talking about explanation. One of my favorite topics in philosophy of

01:25.640 --> 01:32.840
science is something I dealt with a lot in my PhD thesis. So if we think about

01:32.840 --> 01:40.040
what we want out of science, so consider what we're after. We want to be

01:40.040 --> 01:43.560
able to predict things, of course. You want to be able to know what's going to

01:43.560 --> 01:49.560
happen next, but you also want some capacity. I would insist that

01:49.560 --> 01:52.520
these are two different things. You also want to be able to explain things.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.520
So if you think about how long it's been the case that we were able to predict

01:56.520 --> 02:01.000
that the sun was going to rise tomorrow, I mean we've been able to predict that

02:01.000 --> 02:05.640
for ever. I mean as long as we've been able to predict things, we've been able

02:05.640 --> 02:10.120
to predict that the sun would rise tomorrow. But when would you say that

02:10.120 --> 02:12.440
we have a correct explanation for that fact?

02:20.040 --> 02:27.560
When you can explain why we didn't have a...

02:27.560 --> 02:33.160
So when did we learn how to explain that the sun's rising tomorrow?

02:33.160 --> 02:43.400
Like where we infer, because if the sun has come up every time, every 24 hours.

02:43.400 --> 02:48.360
Yeah, but that's the prediction part. So this is, I mean there's the prediction

02:48.360 --> 02:51.560
that it's going to come up tomorrow, which we've been very reliably right about

02:51.560 --> 02:55.880
for a very, very long time. Probably before language, we had this figure there.

03:02.680 --> 03:07.800
Yeah, yeah, that's where I would roughly put it. There might be some gray areas there where like

03:07.800 --> 03:12.200
Copernicus had a, you know, here's why the sun rises, it's because the earth is spinning

03:12.200 --> 03:15.240
round and round. I take it that that's the correct explanation, roughly.

03:15.960 --> 03:22.680
So we didn't have that until 500 years ago, something like that. So there's this vast

03:22.680 --> 03:26.840
difference between being able to, historically at least, being able to predict that the sun's

03:26.840 --> 03:33.000
going to rise and actually understanding why it rises. Like we had previous explanations,

03:33.000 --> 03:40.680
one of which was that the sun is spinning round and round us, or that the chariots of the gods

03:40.680 --> 03:45.800
are dragging it across the heavens. That was a previous explanation. I take those are attempts

03:45.800 --> 03:52.120
at explanation, but we might want to require that our explanations be true. Like an explanation in

03:52.120 --> 03:57.960
some sense is a, it's a success term, right? You say you've explained something when your

03:57.960 --> 04:06.040
explanation is both good and true, rather than just trying to explain. Yeah. So let's distinguish

04:06.040 --> 04:10.280
prediction from explanation. Explanation might say you have explanations when you

04:11.000 --> 04:17.960
understand something in some deep way. So there's a, typically there's a connection made between

04:17.960 --> 04:25.160
explanation and understanding. And philosophers have spent a whole bunch of time and energy trying

04:25.160 --> 04:31.000
to understand specifically scientific explanations, that there might be something different about

04:31.000 --> 04:37.560
scientific explanations than other kinds of explanations, not just sort of pseudoscientific

04:37.560 --> 04:44.040
explanations, but the style of explanation that scientists are interested in seems to be different

04:44.040 --> 04:50.040
than other types of explanation. So let me give you a contrast for scientific explanation,

04:50.040 --> 04:57.480
which is something like historical explanation. Okay, now I don't want to insist that historical

04:57.480 --> 05:03.000
explanation has to have this character, but I'll tell you as a matter of fact, the kind of explanation

05:03.000 --> 05:07.720
that professional academic historians have been interested in, since like the 70s or 80s or

05:07.720 --> 05:16.280
something like that, has been less focused on grand overarching theories of history. Something

05:16.280 --> 05:22.120
happened in the 70s where historians noticed that their explanations had a specific character,

05:22.120 --> 05:28.920
they call it wig history, where, you know, they developed these grand historical stories that

05:30.040 --> 05:38.040
basically had the narrative structure of Europe saves the universe, that the grand march of

05:38.040 --> 05:43.320
history was all heading towards the modern European nation state, and that that's where it was all

05:43.320 --> 05:48.840
leading the whole time. They noticed that their stories had this character and got really uncomfortable

05:48.840 --> 05:55.480
with that fact, probably rightly so. A, because it was politically bad, and B, because it was

05:55.480 --> 06:01.000
simply distorting how things happen, like that's not how history works, it doesn't head specifically

06:01.000 --> 06:06.520
towards some outcome, it's things happen and there's a bunch of reasons why they happen. So

06:07.640 --> 06:13.720
they got really nervous about these grand historical narratives and started telling historical stories

06:13.720 --> 06:21.480
that were very specific in their time and place. So a historian now will focus on like medical history

06:21.480 --> 06:28.440
in Italy in 1450 to 1470 in this specific social class or something like that, right? They'll get

06:28.440 --> 06:34.760
these really, really specific things that they want to explain and the style of explanation that

06:34.760 --> 06:40.040
historians tend to use, again this is not a fact of nature, this is just the historians that I hang

06:40.120 --> 06:47.800
it with. They want to understand things not by trying to fit them into kinds and categories of

06:47.800 --> 06:55.160
events. What they want to do is understand all of the detailed specifics of that moment in time

06:55.160 --> 07:02.840
and space. They understand the event more deeply by layering in more and more context so that you

07:02.840 --> 07:10.440
can see what's absolutely unique about that thing that they're trying to understand. So this is a

07:10.440 --> 07:16.520
way of explaining and understanding the world. It's a kind of contextual specific focused and

07:16.520 --> 07:22.760
detailed way of understanding and the explanations they give are kind of long detailed stories about

07:22.760 --> 07:29.880
that time and place. And I want to suggest that this contrasts with the way that scientists are

07:29.880 --> 07:36.840
typically interested in explaining and understanding things. So in scientific explanation the tendency

07:36.840 --> 07:42.920
is to be focused more on understanding the similarities between different things than

07:42.920 --> 07:49.480
understanding one thing in its kind of complex context. So every single snowflake is of course unique

07:50.280 --> 07:56.760
but that's the uniqueness of the snowflake is not what somebody who's doing a scientific study on

07:56.760 --> 08:02.760
it wants to understand. They want to understand the general regularities of all snowflakes. What

08:02.760 --> 08:08.200
are the rules of construction that snowflakes follow? What are the general principles that

08:08.200 --> 08:14.120
describe their geometry? These are the kind of things that scientists try to understand. So their

08:14.120 --> 08:20.120
explanations are not pitched at the level of why does this specific snowflake have this specific

08:20.120 --> 08:26.040
structure? It's an extreme example but I think it kind of carries over. Scientific explanations

08:26.040 --> 08:32.840
typically more interested in the general features of the world rather than zooming in and getting

08:32.840 --> 08:39.320
the very detailed understanding of one specific thing. Does that contrast make some sense? Good.

08:39.320 --> 08:45.080
So again these are not, I mean it's not a fact of, it's not a fact about nature that these different

08:45.080 --> 08:50.360
disciplines have to have these different interests but there's certainly an actual fact about what

08:50.360 --> 08:55.640
these groups are interested in today and that seems to be the distinction. So yeah.

08:56.200 --> 09:02.680
Maybe it's the difference between memorizing all the code for a piece of software versus

09:03.400 --> 09:08.040
knowing the principles of how to code. Something like that. Yeah. And knowing the

09:08.040 --> 09:14.040
principles of how to code would be more valuable than just memorizing an individual piece of software.

09:14.040 --> 09:20.040
What depends what you're interested in, right? Like I take it that these are two different ways

09:20.040 --> 09:25.880
of processing the world actually. So there's different styles of understanding and each

09:25.880 --> 09:30.520
style of understanding is more appropriate for some context than for others. So for example,

09:30.520 --> 09:37.000
when you're dealing with human beings on a one-to-one basis, you probably don't want to go,

09:37.000 --> 09:40.680
ah well here are the general categories that you fall under and I'm going to just

09:40.680 --> 09:44.520
understand you in terms of those general categories. Most people, if you're dealing with

09:44.520 --> 09:49.160
somebody on a one-to-one basis, prefer for you to be interested in the specifics and details of

09:49.160 --> 09:53.880
their actual life, right? Like you don't want to just reduce somebody to a category, you want them

09:53.880 --> 09:59.560
to meet you as a unique individual with unique properties that have to be understood in terms

09:59.560 --> 10:05.800
of your life history and context. I don't know, that's how I prefer to be met and understood.

10:06.360 --> 10:12.040
So depending on your project, depending on your interests, one or the other of those styles of

10:12.040 --> 10:16.280
understanding might be more appropriate and we kind of mix and match them, right? So it's not the

10:16.280 --> 10:21.560
case that all scientific explanation is purely general. I mean if you're doing paleontology,

10:21.560 --> 10:25.960
you're interested in history, if you're doing some types of history, you're interested in

10:25.960 --> 10:31.400
generalities, but this is a this is the broad trend and there are these two sort of semi-separate

10:31.400 --> 10:36.600
but interacting ways of getting at the world. And today we're going to talk about just one of them,

10:36.600 --> 10:41.800
we're really going to focus on the scientific style, the general style of explanation, okay?

10:43.320 --> 10:50.680
Okay, so as I said, scientific explanation tends to be interested in classes and categories,

10:50.680 --> 10:55.080
right? You want to find the kinds of things and understand the kind of thing that you're looking

10:55.160 --> 11:01.320
at. A political scientist, for example, kind of science, might want to try to understand

11:01.320 --> 11:06.840
revolutions in general, right? So political revolutions, say under what conditions do

11:06.840 --> 11:11.800
revolutions arise? And to understand that and to answer that question, what you do is

11:12.440 --> 11:18.200
try to find all the conditions that are similar across revolutions in history, right? And then

11:18.200 --> 11:23.560
if you have that, maybe you'll be able to do things like predict future revolutions and

11:23.560 --> 11:29.800
understand the causes and factors that lead to one coming about. Whereas a historian, somebody in

11:29.800 --> 11:35.000
a more historical mode, doesn't want to understand, so they say they're looking at the French

11:35.000 --> 11:39.160
Revolution, they don't want to understand the similarity between the French Revolution and

11:39.160 --> 11:45.480
all the other revolutions. They want to understand that moment, what exactly was going on in France

11:45.480 --> 11:51.400
at that time, you know, kind of very detailed way without really worrying too much about whether

11:51.480 --> 11:58.200
it generalizes. So it's about the difference between understanding the class kind or category of thing

11:58.200 --> 12:05.960
that you're interested in versus trying to understand this specific object. Okay, so

12:08.040 --> 12:15.720
and the way that this has usually been formulated by philosophers of science is trying to understand

12:15.720 --> 12:22.600
things in terms of the laws of nature. So for most of the 20th century, philosophers assumed

12:23.320 --> 12:29.560
that scientific knowledge takes the form of laws of nature. And the assumption was that they'd be

12:29.560 --> 12:34.520
universal laws of nature. We've had some debate about that since, but for our purposes, this is a

12:34.520 --> 12:42.360
good place to start. So laws have the form, the following form, all members of the category X

12:42.440 --> 12:47.560
have the property Y. That's a universal claim. It's a claim of all members of the category.

12:47.560 --> 12:53.000
And it's attributing to all members of the category, some property. So all copper is

12:53.000 --> 12:59.160
conductive. That's a classic, for philosophers, that's a classic law of nature, or all electrons

12:59.160 --> 13:05.640
have negative charge, all massive objects attract each other gravitation. These are the kind of

13:05.640 --> 13:10.840
laws that philosophers are interested in. You can see how they are categorical in the sense that they

13:10.840 --> 13:20.760
try to understand the properties of a category. Just saying that it's got this form is probably

13:20.760 --> 13:27.640
not sufficient. So just having universal form doesn't make something a law of nature. Philosophers

13:27.640 --> 13:35.560
spend a lot of time trying to figure out what the extra secret sauce is. But here's the problem. So

13:35.640 --> 13:43.320
compare the following three claims, and they all have that universal form. They all attribute to

13:43.320 --> 13:51.000
all members of a category the property. So there are no spheres of uranium bigger than one kilometer

13:51.000 --> 13:56.440
in diameter. And I'm pretty confident that that one's true. I've never been to most of the universe,

13:56.440 --> 14:02.440
but if you put that much uranium all in one place, it explodes. Like it has a very strong

14:02.440 --> 14:11.880
tendency to undergo a nuclear reaction. So you can't have a sphere of uranium bigger than one

14:11.880 --> 14:19.240
kilometer. Okay. Probably there's also no spheres of gold bigger than one kilometer in diameter.

14:20.040 --> 14:28.040
I don't know of any. But I can't say that with the same certainty. Because there's no law, I don't

14:28.040 --> 14:34.760
think this one is a law of nature. Some bizarrely motivated alien species could go around and collect

14:34.760 --> 14:41.240
just an unbelievable amount of gold and put it all into a sphere. It's not impossible in the same way.

14:49.720 --> 14:55.080
I think there's no naturally occurring ones. Very probable. But again, there's a sort of

14:55.080 --> 15:00.600
difference in character here where one's very unlikely and one is just not going to happen.

15:02.360 --> 15:08.280
Like if you studied all the asteroids in the universe, you might find one that just has

15:08.280 --> 15:13.400
a ridiculous amount of gold in it? It could. I mean, it's extremely unlikely.

15:14.520 --> 15:18.840
But even if both of this, so let's for the for the minute, for the for now, let's assume that

15:18.840 --> 15:23.320
both of these are actually true. I think it's not unreasonable to say that there's probably no spheres

15:23.320 --> 15:29.880
of gold bigger than a kilometer. But one of them has to be true. One of them kind of happens to be

15:29.880 --> 15:37.400
true. Consider this one, all the coins in Corey's pocket on March 9th are quarters. I should have

15:37.400 --> 15:40.920
brought some quarters to make this true. This is I have no change in my pocket right now. But

15:40.920 --> 15:47.080
suppose I've got a couple of quarters in my pocket, that sentence is true of the entire

15:47.080 --> 15:52.680
class or category of things that it's describing. But that could definitely be some other way,

15:52.680 --> 15:56.360
right? Like if I put a loony in my pocket, it wouldn't suddenly turn into a quarter.

15:57.080 --> 16:03.880
So all of these have got the structure that I just described. So it's attributing so all

16:03.880 --> 16:11.480
members of the category X have the property Y. If you put these in logical form, they actually

16:11.480 --> 16:16.040
apply to every object in the universe because they say, if something is a coin in Corey's

16:16.040 --> 16:21.320
pocket on March 9th, then it is a quarter. And that's true of literally every object of the

16:21.320 --> 16:26.600
universe. You say that's the chair, it's not a coin in Corey's pocket. Therefore, it's true that

16:26.600 --> 16:32.840
if it's a coin, then it's a quarter, that kind of thing. So these in the kind of logical form that

16:32.840 --> 16:40.120
philosophers like to phrase these things, these are all true of literally every object in the

16:40.120 --> 16:48.120
universe. But only the top one, only this one about uranium seems to have the sometimes talk

16:48.120 --> 16:53.640
about the modal force of a law of nature. Laws of nature are not supposed to be coincidentally

16:53.640 --> 16:59.720
true generalizations. They're supposed to be things that have to be true. Not in a logical sense,

16:59.720 --> 17:05.240
but in a physical, the physical properties of the universe preclude something from being

17:05.240 --> 17:09.720
a uranium sphere bigger than a kilometer. Whereas there's nothing in the laws of nature,

17:09.720 --> 17:16.120
as far as I can tell, that requires that there can't be a one kilometer sphere of gold,

17:16.200 --> 17:20.840
or that I could have a coin in my pocket that's not a quarter. That one I'm very confident about.

17:22.200 --> 17:27.000
So these laws are supposed to be universal generalizations, and they're supposed to have this

17:27.000 --> 17:33.320
kind of sort of necessity. So this is the thing that philosophers, I won't spend too much time

17:33.320 --> 17:40.680
troubling you about this, but trying to characterize what property this top one has that these other

17:40.760 --> 17:47.480
two don't has been a bone of contention. Because if you're an empiricist, if you believe that

17:47.480 --> 17:52.920
all of our knowledge comes through our senses, all you ever observe is something never happening.

17:53.880 --> 18:01.880
Like, I never see any gold spheres bigger than a kilometer. That's a true observation,

18:01.880 --> 18:08.280
and you don't see the necessity of this, of this uranium thing. Necessity is not something you

18:08.360 --> 18:14.760
can observe. You just see that it never happens. So trying to describe what makes one of these

18:14.760 --> 18:20.200
necessary, an actual law, and the other two not laws, is we've been working on it. There's some

18:20.200 --> 18:27.800
debate. Okay, so there's laws of nature. The classic view of scientific explanation is that

18:27.800 --> 18:34.920
your explanation should involve a law of nature, of this form. So I'd like to introduce you to the

18:34.920 --> 18:41.960
deductive, nomological account of explanation. So Carl Hempel and Paul Oppenheim wrote this up in

18:41.960 --> 18:50.600
the 40s, mid 40s, presented this as a trying to kind of very clearly say what counts as a scientific

18:50.600 --> 18:57.640
explanation. And the basics, the basic idea is a scientific explanation deduces the thing that

18:57.640 --> 19:05.800
you want explained from a law of nature and some initial conditions. So what an explanation does is

19:05.800 --> 19:11.240
take a law of nature and some specific facts about the world and then deduces the thing you want

19:11.240 --> 19:16.360
explained from that pair. That's what makes something a good scientific explanation.

19:18.760 --> 19:24.520
Here's the general form of it. There's a condition or fact. There's a general law,

19:24.600 --> 19:30.040
and then you just deduce that from that, from the conditional condition or in general law.

19:30.920 --> 19:35.240
In the explanation literature, we separate the parts of an explanation into

19:35.800 --> 19:42.680
explanands and explanandum. I won't make you memorize that, but this is if you want to refer to

19:42.680 --> 19:49.320
the thing you want explained, that's the explanandum, and the thing doing the explaining is the explanands.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.320
Okay, so here's an example very similar to the one

19:54.120 --> 20:00.360
Hempel and Oppenheim give. So the explanandum is why did the pipes in my house burst? So you go

20:00.360 --> 20:08.200
to your kitchen and you see water pouring out, and you say why, why? Well, here's a condition,

20:08.200 --> 20:12.360
here's a fact of the world. The pipes are made of metal and they're filled with water and it's

20:12.360 --> 20:18.680
freezing. So you're allowed to give yourself several facts, but like metal pipes, water in them,

20:18.680 --> 20:27.720
freezing cold. And here's two general laws. When water freezes, it expands. When metal gets cold,

20:27.720 --> 20:33.560
it contracts. And you can put those facts and those rules together to get that the pipes are

20:33.560 --> 20:39.320
going to break. Hempel's one was like a radiator, but I don't know if I think it's more familiar

20:39.320 --> 20:45.880
now than having a radiator filled with water. Okay, so this is what a scientific explanation is,

20:45.880 --> 20:50.520
according to Hempel and Oppenheim. Here's the picture. Here's what it is to explain something

20:50.520 --> 20:56.120
scientifically. You take some facts, you take some laws, and you use them to deduce the thing that

20:56.120 --> 21:03.240
you're interested in. Yeah, pretty good, right? And then we figured it out and it was all over

21:03.240 --> 21:08.520
and nobody talks about it again. Hey, like it always happens in philosophy. We just come straight

21:08.520 --> 21:14.280
to the correct answer and then nobody talks about it anymore. Okay, not really. All right.

21:14.280 --> 21:20.760
Okay, so that was their first pass at this, the deductive nomological account, deductive in

21:20.760 --> 21:27.240
that you deduce things nomological in that it's law based. Of course, a lot of our scientific

21:27.240 --> 21:33.240
knowledge is not universal in that way, right? The laws of nature that I just showed you are

21:33.240 --> 21:38.920
kind of exceptions because most of our scientific knowledge takes the form of statistical facts.

21:38.920 --> 21:43.640
We know something happens a lot of the time or most of the time or regularly, something like that.

21:44.680 --> 21:51.960
So they developed a second model to kind of handle the second style of laws of nature,

21:51.960 --> 21:58.520
the inductive statistical method. So instead of deducing the thing to explain what you get,

21:58.520 --> 22:04.920
so in a deduction, if you haven't done sort of philosophy stuff, in deductions, you get the

22:04.920 --> 22:10.360
conclusion with certainty. So if the premises are true, the conclusion is certain to be true.

22:11.000 --> 22:16.280
In induction, what you say is, if the premises are true, then the conclusion is likely to be

22:16.280 --> 22:23.320
true. So you get a high probability or something like that. So you suppose you've got a tank of

22:23.320 --> 22:30.040
water and you drop an ink drop in it, and it spreads out. So why does that happen? Why does

22:30.040 --> 22:38.600
the ink spread out? And you can give a really good statistical answer to this. So if you characterize

22:38.600 --> 22:45.880
the number of possible states of the system, so all of the ways that the ink can be distributed,

22:45.880 --> 22:51.320
there's just way, way more ways in which it's evenly distributed than if it's like clumped up

22:51.320 --> 22:57.880
in one little spot. So if you say the system is randomly chugging through states, it's just going

22:57.880 --> 23:03.960
to go to some random state, there's almost infinitely more states in which it's randomly and

23:03.960 --> 23:08.600
evenly distributed than there are states in which it's clumped up in one corner or something. So

23:08.600 --> 23:14.840
if you drop an ink drop in a thing of water and it all zooms to just one spot, that's super weird.

23:14.840 --> 23:22.440
It's not impossible. Statistically speaking, that is a thing that it could do, but it's exceptionally

23:22.440 --> 23:27.560
unlikely. This is by the way the same kind of explanation you'd give if you want to know why

23:27.560 --> 23:32.920
is the air in this room roughly evenly distributed? Like why isn't it all pressed down against the

23:33.000 --> 23:39.480
floor or against one wall? The answer is because there's just way, way, way more ways for it to

23:39.480 --> 23:46.040
be roughly evenly distributed than there are for it to be pressed up against one wall. And the system

23:46.040 --> 23:53.560
is just randomly going through states. If you sat in this room for a trillion, trillion, trillion

23:53.560 --> 23:59.240
years, maybe for one second, it would be unevenly distributed. It would mostly be on this side as

23:59.320 --> 24:03.480
it just kind of randomly goes through its states. But you can get that the air is not going to do

24:03.480 --> 24:09.320
that with extremely high probability by doing this kind of statistical explanation. Okay,

24:10.200 --> 24:14.920
so good. We've got the deductive account for things that are always true. We've got the

24:14.920 --> 24:20.440
inductive account for things that are mostly or usually true. Yeah. So in that situation,

24:21.080 --> 24:28.760
wouldn't the vacuum created destroy the room? Maybe. It could only be, it could happen for a

24:28.760 --> 24:36.920
split second and not destroy the room. I don't know. It's extremely, I'm not super worried about

24:36.920 --> 24:42.280
what would happen because it's so hilariously unlikely to happen. We could sit here for many

24:42.280 --> 24:50.280
times the age of the universe and it would never happen. Yeah. If you're laying in bed waiting,

24:50.280 --> 24:53.960
worried at night that the air might all suddenly rush to one side of your room,

24:54.680 --> 25:02.680
it's you'll be fine. Don't worry. Okay. Okay. So let's do some problems with this. So this,

25:02.680 --> 25:07.080
this was the kind of first pass at this stuff comes out in the 40s. People pretty quickly

25:07.080 --> 25:13.800
noticed that there are some issues with both of these accounts. So I started by saying that

25:13.800 --> 25:17.880
there's some big difference between explanation and prediction. Temple actually just goes ahead

25:17.880 --> 25:21.560
and denies this. He says, no, no, no, that's basically the same thing. Because if you can

25:21.560 --> 25:26.120
deduce that something's going to happen, then you've got a prediction that it's going to happen.

25:26.120 --> 25:30.680
The only real difference between an explanation and a prediction for temple is that an explanation,

25:30.680 --> 25:35.960
the thing has already happened. Whereas in a prediction is still in the future. That's it.

25:35.960 --> 25:44.920
That's the only difference. But that produces some weird results for his view. For example,

25:44.920 --> 25:52.280
the famous flagpole. So if I want to explanation, so we got a flagpole, we got the sun and the

25:52.280 --> 25:59.720
flagpole is casting a shadow. So on Hempel's account, you can explain the length of the shadow

25:59.720 --> 26:05.800
by citing the specific position of the sun, and then some universal laws about geometry.

26:05.800 --> 26:12.120
You just your, your, you know, grade A geometry lets you predict how long that shadow is going to be.

26:15.160 --> 26:22.920
But you can do this the other way as well. Suppose you ask, why is the sun where it is?

26:23.960 --> 26:30.040
I want an explanation for the position of the sun in the sky. Well, I know the length of the shadow

26:30.040 --> 26:37.560
and the height of the flagpole. And I know some geometry. And I can deduce where the sun is.

26:37.560 --> 26:46.120
Now, it's perfectly fine to say you can predict where the sun is based on those facts. That's no

26:46.120 --> 26:52.440
worry. But can you explain basis? So say, can you explain to me why the sun is right there? And you

26:52.440 --> 26:58.760
say, well, there's a flagpole, it's this high, and there's a shadow, it's this long. Therefore,

26:58.760 --> 27:06.520
that's why the sun is where it is. That's weird, right? That's not why the sun is where it is.

27:06.840 --> 27:14.200
But on Hempel's account, that comes out as a good explanation, as good as the other way around.

27:14.200 --> 27:19.080
Like, I'm real happy with like, why is the shadow that long? Like, well, the sun's there and had

27:19.080 --> 27:25.320
flagpoles this high. Why is the sun there? You shouldn't know facts about the flagpole are helpful

27:25.320 --> 27:31.480
for understanding why the sun is where it is, right? Predicting yes, explaining people like,

27:31.480 --> 27:37.240
no, no, no, no, no, that's not that's not going to work. Okay, so the famous flagpole example,

27:38.360 --> 27:44.520
people get pretty worried about that. They also get worried about things being cited that are

27:44.520 --> 27:50.920
kind of irrelevant. So here's John Jones, John Jones does not have a uterus. But every day,

27:50.920 --> 27:56.760
John Jones takes a birth control pill. And John Jones does not get pregnant.

27:57.720 --> 28:00.920
Good for him. He's very careful. He's very cautious.

28:02.440 --> 28:07.080
He's got no uterus, but he does take birth controls. John Jones fails to get pregnant.

28:08.360 --> 28:12.840
Well, here's a good, here's a good deductive explanation for that.

28:13.720 --> 28:17.800
Anybody who doesn't have a uterus and takes birth control pills will not get pregnant.

28:18.520 --> 28:22.920
John Jones does not have a uterus. He takes birth control pills. Therefore, he does not get pregnant.

28:23.640 --> 28:25.640
Yeah.

28:35.320 --> 28:43.560
It's not recommended. Okay, it's not generally recommended. Yeah. But if you're going to ask,

28:43.560 --> 28:49.480
why does John Jones not get pregnant, the birth control pills are really a super important

28:49.480 --> 28:54.040
part of the story, right? I mean, maybe the problem is his boyfriend isn't for time.

28:57.080 --> 29:04.840
Right. Thank you. Thank you for that. That's okay. So you can cite, so following

29:04.840 --> 29:10.680
Hempel's model to the letter, you can cite stuff that's irrelevant. You can put it into the story,

29:11.240 --> 29:13.960
and it still counts as part of the explanation.

29:14.600 --> 29:22.280
Yeah. So you can cite irrelevancies. Another example that he uses, critics of Hempel use,

29:22.840 --> 29:27.800
every morning I have a cup of coffee and I say a magical ritual over it, and then I drink the

29:27.800 --> 29:34.680
coffee and it wakes me up. Therefore, saying a magical ritual over my coffee and drinking it

29:34.680 --> 29:41.720
is responsible for explains why the coffee wakes me up. Like, yeah, no, it doesn't. You can deduce

29:41.720 --> 29:46.120
it, right? So there's a very strong regularity. Every time you drink a cup of coffee that you

29:46.120 --> 29:50.200
set a little magical ritual over, it does wake you up. So that's a universal regularity.

29:51.320 --> 29:56.440
You can say a law of nature about it if you want. But that's not an explanation.

29:57.800 --> 30:06.760
Okay. So diagnosing these problems, philosopher said, okay, here's what you messed up,

30:06.760 --> 30:15.000
Hempel, here's what you left out. You can't just cite the universal laws to explain something.

30:15.000 --> 30:22.040
You need to cite the causes of that thing, right? You have to cite the things that caused it to

30:22.040 --> 30:29.160
happen. That's the problem with these examples, right? What you're citing are true universal

30:29.160 --> 30:36.360
regularities, but you're not citing the causes of things. So yeah, you can explain the length of the

30:36.360 --> 30:40.760
shadow by citing the position of the sun and the height because they caused the length of the

30:40.760 --> 30:48.200
shadow. That's what caused the shadow to be where it is, the sun and the flagpole and geometry, I

30:48.200 --> 30:54.920
guess. But the length of the shadow doesn't cause the sun to do anything, right? There's no, if you

30:54.920 --> 31:01.240
somehow manipulate the length of the shadow, you're not manipulating the sun, right? So that's the

31:01.240 --> 31:06.120
problem with that example. Say, look, you cited a universal regularity, but you didn't cite the

31:06.120 --> 31:11.400
causes. You can explain stuff, you got to tell me what caused it. That's the critique.

31:13.400 --> 31:16.280
And again, you can't explain why John Jones feels to get pregnant

31:17.960 --> 31:23.640
because that's not what caused it. That's not the causal story about John Jones not getting pregnant.

31:24.360 --> 31:28.520
If he hadn't taken the pills, he still wouldn't have gotten pregnant. So this is one of the tests

31:28.520 --> 31:33.640
that you do for something being a cause. If it's there, then you get the effect. If you take it

31:33.640 --> 31:42.520
away, then you shouldn't get the effect anymore, right? And similar problems appear for the

31:43.080 --> 31:49.560
inductive statistical explanations. You get similar issues. So let me, I don't expect I can do this

31:49.560 --> 31:55.640
better than the article. Right. So this is an old-timey example. I don't think

31:56.760 --> 32:01.480
syphilis gets talked a lot about anymore, but here's the classic example.

32:02.280 --> 32:11.160
Okay. Okay. Then this is topical. All right. All right. So the town mayor suffers from a

32:11.160 --> 32:15.880
motor deficiency characterized by the limitation of certain movements and a loss in muscular strength,

32:15.880 --> 32:21.000
which is called peresis. And we know roughly a quarter of patients with untreated latent syphilis

32:21.000 --> 32:26.120
are victim to peresis. And we know that the mayor has precisely such latent syphilis,

32:26.120 --> 32:29.720
the condition he was not aware of and was constantly not having, consequently not having

32:29.720 --> 32:35.960
treated. Intuitively, what we have here is an explanation of the mayor's peresis, right? Why

32:35.960 --> 32:44.280
did the mayor have this muscular condition? Because he had syphilis. However, the law linking

32:44.280 --> 32:50.840
syphilis to peresis only brings the, and the fact that the mayor's got syphilis, only brings the

32:50.840 --> 32:58.760
mayor's probability up to 25%. And the inductive statistical account doesn't tell us exactly what

32:58.760 --> 33:06.760
counts as high probability, but 25% doesn't sound about, doesn't sound right. That doesn't sound

33:06.760 --> 33:12.680
like a high probability. It's actually odds are lower than even that he's going to get this condition.

33:13.320 --> 33:18.760
So inductive statistical account said, you explain something by showing how it was very likely.

33:19.480 --> 33:25.240
I mean, the ink blot thing is the ink spreading in water is unimaginably likely. It's so close to

33:26.040 --> 33:32.120
100% probable that there's kind of no difference. But this time it's like less than half. It's a quarter.

33:33.800 --> 33:42.440
Nonetheless, seems like we can explain why he has peresis based on citing the fact that he's got

33:42.440 --> 33:46.920
untreated syphilis. Yeah? Okay.

33:53.800 --> 34:00.680
Would it depend on there being another way of explaining, like if there was another medical

34:00.680 --> 34:07.720
condition that could? Well, in this scenario, so supposing this scenario, this is the cause of

34:07.720 --> 34:17.240
his peresis. We know for a fact that syphilis caused his peresis. So if what we wanted of our

34:17.240 --> 34:25.560
explanations is the causes, then this is fine as an explanation. And intuitively, most people say,

34:25.560 --> 34:31.560
yeah, that's a good explanation. Why is this guy got peresis? Because he had untreated syphilis.

34:32.520 --> 34:36.280
But on the inductive statistical account, this doesn't work as an explanation because you're

34:36.280 --> 34:47.400
supposed to get out that it's got a high probability. So that's weird, right? It's worrisome for the

34:47.400 --> 34:54.920
inductive statistical account. Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

34:55.560 --> 34:58.440
They didn't do it that everyone got syphilis in the town.

34:59.320 --> 35:05.800
Then you could say, I think it was 100% or it was very likely that 25% would have syphilis.

35:05.800 --> 35:09.960
Good. Okay. So interesting. Now, what you've done is shift the

35:09.960 --> 35:16.360
explanandum there. So you say, why is it the case that 25 people, so if there's 100 people in

35:16.360 --> 35:22.280
town with syphilis, why is it the case that there's 25 people with peresis? Now you've got

35:22.280 --> 35:29.080
this nice statistical explanation, 25% of cases develop into peresis, and you've got 100 cases,

35:29.080 --> 35:33.400
therefore it's very likely that 25 people will have it. Yeah. So if you shift the thing you're

35:33.400 --> 35:40.120
trying to explain to the population, then that works nicely. Yeah. But if we're just interested

35:40.120 --> 35:45.080
in the mayor, then the inductive statistics, it seems like intuitively, it should still explain

35:45.080 --> 35:55.480
why this one specific guy got peresis, and it doesn't seem to do that. Yeah. Good. Okay.

35:56.760 --> 36:04.520
So all of the examples I've shown you so far are pretty neatly resolved by just looking at

36:05.400 --> 36:11.000
the causes. Say, how do you explain something? Well, you cite the causes that brought it about.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.600
Ta-da. Pretty good, right?

36:18.120 --> 36:24.680
So, but that gets us into some weird and tricky issues. So,

36:27.880 --> 36:33.000
like, what does it mean for one thing to cause another thing? It turns out there's a

36:33.560 --> 36:39.000
humongous debate about this, especially in complex cases. Yeah.

36:39.320 --> 36:45.000
One of the issues is that something always causes another thing to cause effects. So

36:46.120 --> 36:52.920
you might know how snow is caused, temperature and stuff, but then you have to ask why. Like,

36:52.920 --> 36:57.560
if there's another, once you know how snow is made, you ask why does water create this, and then

36:59.320 --> 37:05.320
why does it just keep going? There is, there is, this is how people end up being philosophers.

37:05.320 --> 37:09.080
They do this, like, why is, okay, say, why is it, why does snow create it? Oh, because

37:09.080 --> 37:12.600
water freezes. Why does water freeze? Because chemical properties. Why does it have those

37:12.600 --> 37:15.960
chemical properties? And then eventually you get to metaphysical questions and

37:16.840 --> 37:21.720
A, people stop talking to you and B, you end up doing philosophy degree. So careful, careful

37:21.720 --> 37:28.680
about that. Yeah. In order to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first recreate the universe.

37:28.680 --> 37:32.360
Close Carl Sagan. Very good. That was my best Carl Sagan person.

37:35.480 --> 37:41.400
Okay. But even absent this kind of regressive why questions, we've got serious and difficult

37:41.400 --> 37:46.920
questions about assigning causes to things that were pretty sure happened. So what are, what would

37:46.920 --> 37:53.560
you say are the causes of the weather today? I mean, you obvious things. There's pressure. There's

37:53.640 --> 38:04.760
season. There's geography. But what we know about weather is that it's unimaginably sensitive to

38:04.760 --> 38:14.760
small changes. So if you make an incredibly tiny difference 100 years ago, it, or even 10, 10 days

38:14.760 --> 38:19.240
ago, sometimes it translates into big, big changes in the overall system. So this is one of the

38:19.240 --> 38:24.200
things we learned by studying weather simulations. For example, when you run a weather simulation,

38:24.200 --> 38:31.400
and you change one variable at the like 10th significant digit, you run it for a little while,

38:31.400 --> 38:35.480
it very quickly diverges to some other state. Yeah, yeah.

38:40.920 --> 38:43.640
That's right. Yeah. So this is the sometimes called the butterfly effect.

38:44.600 --> 38:49.080
It's the idea that a butterfly flaps its wings in the Andes. And then two weeks later,

38:49.080 --> 38:55.160
there's rain instead of sun across the world. And that's, I mean, so it's a general property of

38:55.160 --> 38:59.880
complex nonlinear dynamical systems that that's going to be true, or at least some class of them.

38:59.880 --> 39:04.840
And we're pretty confident that it's true of the weather. So if you want to ask, okay, so what's

39:04.840 --> 39:11.800
the weather? Why is the weather the way it is today? You might have to talk about the weather on

39:11.800 --> 39:19.240
Jupiter 10 years ago. You might have to talk about an errant comet passing beyond the bounds

39:19.240 --> 39:26.200
of our solar system. Like, you might have to talk about random quantum mechanical fluctuations in the

39:26.200 --> 39:39.960
sun. Like, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So the, the number of factors and the numbers factors, if you say,

39:39.960 --> 39:46.360
I want to explain something, okay, great. So just cite the causes. Well, that makes the explanation

39:47.640 --> 39:54.840
very quickly expand out to include the whole history of the universe, which is kind of inconvenient.

39:55.880 --> 40:01.160
I take it that I mean, the assumption in this is that my assumption is typically that an explanation

40:01.160 --> 40:06.360
is something that a human being could give or receive, right? Explanation is something that

40:06.360 --> 40:11.880
we do amongst people. And if you have to cite the entire history of the universe since the Big Bang,

40:12.920 --> 40:18.680
that's not going to work for us in any practical sense, right? I take it the scientific explanation

40:18.680 --> 40:22.680
is something that we can do. And if it's suddenly the case that, okay, we figured out that it's

40:22.680 --> 40:26.760
got to be causes, but now we just figured out that we can't explain anything because you'd have to

40:26.760 --> 40:34.760
describe the entire history of the universe. That's kind of worrying. So Hempel notices this

40:34.760 --> 40:41.640
actually. And one way, one way of dealing with this is to just say, look, we got too many causes.

40:42.360 --> 40:51.080
The real explanation of any event is actually infinitely complex or practically, for our

40:51.880 --> 40:57.720
practical purposes, it's infinitely complex. And that all that you've ever received or given

40:57.720 --> 41:05.560
are what you might call explanation sketches, tiny, tiny, tiny little slices of the real

41:05.560 --> 41:14.680
explanation, something like that. Yeah, so it's a weird, it's a weird philosophers move that

41:14.680 --> 41:21.560
they get kind of pushed into here. So this, you start out from, hey, people explain things.

41:21.880 --> 41:25.720
I know that you know that we explain things, explain things all the time.

41:27.560 --> 41:32.680
How does that work? Well, here's a story. Okay, that story doesn't work. Here's another story.

41:33.240 --> 41:36.920
That story has the consequence that that thing that we started off trying to understand

41:38.200 --> 41:45.240
is kind of impossible. In the sense that you can't ever actually explain so you can't give

41:45.240 --> 41:52.120
the whole explanation for anything. All you can ever give is the tiniest infinitesimal fraction

41:52.120 --> 41:59.560
of the explanatory story. I don't know how you I don't know how you feel about that. I'm a little

41:59.560 --> 42:04.920
uncomfortable with this as a move to sort of turn something very normal and ordinary into something

42:04.920 --> 42:11.640
inconceivably complex and unrelated to any human activity. I don't know, you could be okay with

42:11.640 --> 42:23.080
that. So this is, yeah, this is the human activity, this end of the front end of the

42:23.080 --> 42:27.720
horse. And then the back end is what the universe is like. It's got much more detail and complexity

42:27.720 --> 42:31.800
than this is what happened. What happened if I tried to draw a horse the front, the front half.

42:32.760 --> 42:39.640
Okay, yeah, yeah, okay, so you could have a reverse situation where like the truth is

42:39.640 --> 42:45.880
this stranger or sorry, sometimes fiction is stranger than truth, where you have a very boring

42:45.880 --> 42:51.480
event that's exaggerated in a way to appear more complex than what actually happened. Okay,

42:51.480 --> 42:59.400
that's a possibility, but that's not what's happening here, right? Okay, so causes as explanatory.

43:00.360 --> 43:02.920
They got some issues. There's some serious questions about

43:05.080 --> 43:10.760
whether this story is acceptable. They kind of hang on what you mean by cause.

43:11.960 --> 43:17.480
So maybe you're willing to consider something much smaller as the cause of today's weather. So

43:17.480 --> 43:22.040
you might say, look, I'm not going to talk about the weather on Jupiter 10 years ago. That's not

43:22.040 --> 43:27.320
part of the story. It's not a big enough factor or an interesting enough factor, something like that.

43:27.320 --> 43:31.880
But now we have to be sort of somewhat more selective. Once again, our interests have kind

43:31.880 --> 43:37.080
of come back into the story. Once again, we've sort of been unable to get this clear. I mean,

43:37.080 --> 43:43.000
what Hemple was going for was a clear objective criteria for what counts as an explanation.

43:43.000 --> 43:48.040
The story he told us was too simple. And as soon as you start trying to complexify it are

43:48.920 --> 43:55.480
what we're interested in gets back into the story. And we'll all develop this a little more next

43:55.480 --> 44:00.120
time. We'll talk a little bit more about causes, what counts as a cause, what counts as a causal

44:00.120 --> 44:05.560
explanation. We'll also talk a little bit about whether all scientific explanations have to cite

44:05.560 --> 44:12.200
causes. So it might be the case that there are non-causal explanations. So that's our topic for

44:12.200 --> 44:15.320
next time. Okay, that's it for today. Thanks everyone.
