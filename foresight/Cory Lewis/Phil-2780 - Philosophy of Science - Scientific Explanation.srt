1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Okay, so welcome back. Right, so we've kind of finished a broad arc in this

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,800
course that I was kind of setting up from the beginning and finished with our

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,960
discussion of social construction, broadly trying to motivate the idea that

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,400
there's both values influence on science, especially in the sense of deciding

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,560
which questions we ask and how we ask them, but that nonetheless science can

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,920
come up with reliable and in some sense objective knowledge in the sense that

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,160
it's at least intersubjectively reliable. So that was kind of the point of that

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,400
the course so far. We're going to shift gears a little bit now, so the rest of

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,520
the course is basically just taking a look at a couple of various issues in

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,240
philosophy of science. Today we're going to shift to doing more philosophy-ish

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,960
philosophy, so less. We've been doing a kind of integrated history and philosophy

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,680
of science largely for the course, so lots of interest in actual scientific

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,600
practice and that sort of thing. Now at least today we're going to start talking

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,760
about kind of more pure philosophy of science, so we're going to take a step

15
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,080
back historically, start talking about stuff that happened in the 40s in

16
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,960
philosophy of science and move on to more modern stuff. Specifically we're going

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,640
to start talking about explanation. One of my favorite topics in philosophy of

18
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,840
science is something I dealt with a lot in my PhD thesis. So if we think about

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:40,040
what we want out of science, so consider what we're after. We want to be

20
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,560
able to predict things, of course. You want to be able to know what's going to

21
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,560
happen next, but you also want some capacity. I would insist that

22
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,520
these are two different things. You also want to be able to explain things.

23
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,520
So if you think about how long it's been the case that we were able to predict

24
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,000
that the sun was going to rise tomorrow, I mean we've been able to predict that

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,640
for ever. I mean as long as we've been able to predict things, we've been able

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,120
to predict that the sun would rise tomorrow. But when would you say that

27
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,440
we have a correct explanation for that fact?

28
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:27,560
When you can explain why we didn't have a...

29
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,160
So when did we learn how to explain that the sun's rising tomorrow?

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:43,400
Like where we infer, because if the sun has come up every time, every 24 hours.

31
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,360
Yeah, but that's the prediction part. So this is, I mean there's the prediction

32
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,560
that it's going to come up tomorrow, which we've been very reliably right about

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,880
for a very, very long time. Probably before language, we had this figure there.

34
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,800
Yeah, yeah, that's where I would roughly put it. There might be some gray areas there where like

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,200
Copernicus had a, you know, here's why the sun rises, it's because the earth is spinning

36
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,240
round and round. I take it that that's the correct explanation, roughly.

37
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:22,680
So we didn't have that until 500 years ago, something like that. So there's this vast

38
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,840
difference between being able to, historically at least, being able to predict that the sun's

39
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,000
going to rise and actually understanding why it rises. Like we had previous explanations,

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,680
one of which was that the sun is spinning round and round us, or that the chariots of the gods

41
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,800
are dragging it across the heavens. That was a previous explanation. I take those are attempts

42
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:52,120
at explanation, but we might want to require that our explanations be true. Like an explanation in

43
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,960
some sense is a, it's a success term, right? You say you've explained something when your

44
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:06,040
explanation is both good and true, rather than just trying to explain. Yeah. So let's distinguish

45
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,280
prediction from explanation. Explanation might say you have explanations when you

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,960
understand something in some deep way. So there's a, typically there's a connection made between

47
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:25,160
explanation and understanding. And philosophers have spent a whole bunch of time and energy trying

48
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,000
to understand specifically scientific explanations, that there might be something different about

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,560
scientific explanations than other kinds of explanations, not just sort of pseudoscientific

50
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,040
explanations, but the style of explanation that scientists are interested in seems to be different

51
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,040
than other types of explanation. So let me give you a contrast for scientific explanation,

52
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:57,480
which is something like historical explanation. Okay, now I don't want to insist that historical

53
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,000
explanation has to have this character, but I'll tell you as a matter of fact, the kind of explanation

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,720
that professional academic historians have been interested in, since like the 70s or 80s or

55
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:16,280
something like that, has been less focused on grand overarching theories of history. Something

56
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,120
happened in the 70s where historians noticed that their explanations had a specific character,

57
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,920
they call it wig history, where, you know, they developed these grand historical stories that

58
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:38,040
basically had the narrative structure of Europe saves the universe, that the grand march of

59
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,320
history was all heading towards the modern European nation state, and that that's where it was all

60
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,840
leading the whole time. They noticed that their stories had this character and got really uncomfortable

61
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:55,480
with that fact, probably rightly so. A, because it was politically bad, and B, because it was

62
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,000
simply distorting how things happen, like that's not how history works, it doesn't head specifically

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,520
towards some outcome, it's things happen and there's a bunch of reasons why they happen. So

64
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:13,720
they got really nervous about these grand historical narratives and started telling historical stories

65
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:21,480
that were very specific in their time and place. So a historian now will focus on like medical history

66
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:28,440
in Italy in 1450 to 1470 in this specific social class or something like that, right? They'll get

67
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,760
these really, really specific things that they want to explain and the style of explanation that

68
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,040
historians tend to use, again this is not a fact of nature, this is just the historians that I hang

69
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:47,800
it with. They want to understand things not by trying to fit them into kinds and categories of

70
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:55,160
events. What they want to do is understand all of the detailed specifics of that moment in time

71
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:02,840
and space. They understand the event more deeply by layering in more and more context so that you

72
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:10,440
can see what's absolutely unique about that thing that they're trying to understand. So this is a

73
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,520
way of explaining and understanding the world. It's a kind of contextual specific focused and

74
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,760
detailed way of understanding and the explanations they give are kind of long detailed stories about

75
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:29,880
that time and place. And I want to suggest that this contrasts with the way that scientists are

76
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:36,840
typically interested in explaining and understanding things. So in scientific explanation the tendency

77
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,920
is to be focused more on understanding the similarities between different things than

78
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:49,480
understanding one thing in its kind of complex context. So every single snowflake is of course unique

79
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:56,760
but that's the uniqueness of the snowflake is not what somebody who's doing a scientific study on

80
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,760
it wants to understand. They want to understand the general regularities of all snowflakes. What

81
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,200
are the rules of construction that snowflakes follow? What are the general principles that

82
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:14,120
describe their geometry? These are the kind of things that scientists try to understand. So their

83
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,120
explanations are not pitched at the level of why does this specific snowflake have this specific

84
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,040
structure? It's an extreme example but I think it kind of carries over. Scientific explanations

85
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:32,840
typically more interested in the general features of the world rather than zooming in and getting

86
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,320
the very detailed understanding of one specific thing. Does that contrast make some sense? Good.

87
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,080
So again these are not, I mean it's not a fact of, it's not a fact about nature that these different

88
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,360
disciplines have to have these different interests but there's certainly an actual fact about what

89
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,640
these groups are interested in today and that seems to be the distinction. So yeah.

90
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:02,680
Maybe it's the difference between memorizing all the code for a piece of software versus

91
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,040
knowing the principles of how to code. Something like that. Yeah. And knowing the

92
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,040
principles of how to code would be more valuable than just memorizing an individual piece of software.

93
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,040
What depends what you're interested in, right? Like I take it that these are two different ways

94
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,880
of processing the world actually. So there's different styles of understanding and each

95
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,520
style of understanding is more appropriate for some context than for others. So for example,

96
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:37,000
when you're dealing with human beings on a one-to-one basis, you probably don't want to go,

97
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,680
ah well here are the general categories that you fall under and I'm going to just

98
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,520
understand you in terms of those general categories. Most people, if you're dealing with

99
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,160
somebody on a one-to-one basis, prefer for you to be interested in the specifics and details of

100
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,880
their actual life, right? Like you don't want to just reduce somebody to a category, you want them

101
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,560
to meet you as a unique individual with unique properties that have to be understood in terms

102
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,800
of your life history and context. I don't know, that's how I prefer to be met and understood.

103
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,040
So depending on your project, depending on your interests, one or the other of those styles of

104
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,280
understanding might be more appropriate and we kind of mix and match them, right? So it's not the

105
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,560
case that all scientific explanation is purely general. I mean if you're doing paleontology,

106
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,960
you're interested in history, if you're doing some types of history, you're interested in

107
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:31,400
generalities, but this is a this is the broad trend and there are these two sort of semi-separate

108
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,600
but interacting ways of getting at the world. And today we're going to talk about just one of them,

109
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,800
we're really going to focus on the scientific style, the general style of explanation, okay?

110
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:50,680
Okay, so as I said, scientific explanation tends to be interested in classes and categories,

111
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,080
right? You want to find the kinds of things and understand the kind of thing that you're looking

112
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,320
at. A political scientist, for example, kind of science, might want to try to understand

113
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,840
revolutions in general, right? So political revolutions, say under what conditions do

114
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,800
revolutions arise? And to understand that and to answer that question, what you do is

115
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,200
try to find all the conditions that are similar across revolutions in history, right? And then

116
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:23,560
if you have that, maybe you'll be able to do things like predict future revolutions and

117
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,800
understand the causes and factors that lead to one coming about. Whereas a historian, somebody in

118
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,000
a more historical mode, doesn't want to understand, so they say they're looking at the French

119
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,160
Revolution, they don't want to understand the similarity between the French Revolution and

120
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:45,480
all the other revolutions. They want to understand that moment, what exactly was going on in France

121
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,400
at that time, you know, kind of very detailed way without really worrying too much about whether

122
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,200
it generalizes. So it's about the difference between understanding the class kind or category of thing

123
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:05,960
that you're interested in versus trying to understand this specific object. Okay, so

124
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:15,720
and the way that this has usually been formulated by philosophers of science is trying to understand

125
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,600
things in terms of the laws of nature. So for most of the 20th century, philosophers assumed

126
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:29,560
that scientific knowledge takes the form of laws of nature. And the assumption was that they'd be

127
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,520
universal laws of nature. We've had some debate about that since, but for our purposes, this is a

128
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:42,360
good place to start. So laws have the form, the following form, all members of the category X

129
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,560
have the property Y. That's a universal claim. It's a claim of all members of the category.

130
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,000
And it's attributing to all members of the category, some property. So all copper is

131
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,160
conductive. That's a classic, for philosophers, that's a classic law of nature, or all electrons

132
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:05,640
have negative charge, all massive objects attract each other gravitation. These are the kind of

133
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,840
laws that philosophers are interested in. You can see how they are categorical in the sense that they

134
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:20,760
try to understand the properties of a category. Just saying that it's got this form is probably

135
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:27,640
not sufficient. So just having universal form doesn't make something a law of nature. Philosophers

136
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:35,560
spend a lot of time trying to figure out what the extra secret sauce is. But here's the problem. So

137
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:43,320
compare the following three claims, and they all have that universal form. They all attribute to

138
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:51,000
all members of a category the property. So there are no spheres of uranium bigger than one kilometer

139
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,440
in diameter. And I'm pretty confident that that one's true. I've never been to most of the universe,

140
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:02,440
but if you put that much uranium all in one place, it explodes. Like it has a very strong

141
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:11,880
tendency to undergo a nuclear reaction. So you can't have a sphere of uranium bigger than one

142
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:19,240
kilometer. Okay. Probably there's also no spheres of gold bigger than one kilometer in diameter.

143
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:28,040
I don't know of any. But I can't say that with the same certainty. Because there's no law, I don't

144
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:34,760
think this one is a law of nature. Some bizarrely motivated alien species could go around and collect

145
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:41,240
just an unbelievable amount of gold and put it all into a sphere. It's not impossible in the same way.

146
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,080
I think there's no naturally occurring ones. Very probable. But again, there's a sort of

147
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,600
difference in character here where one's very unlikely and one is just not going to happen.

148
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:08,280
Like if you studied all the asteroids in the universe, you might find one that just has

149
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:13,400
a ridiculous amount of gold in it? It could. I mean, it's extremely unlikely.

150
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,840
But even if both of this, so let's for the for the minute, for the for now, let's assume that

151
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,320
both of these are actually true. I think it's not unreasonable to say that there's probably no spheres

152
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:29,880
of gold bigger than a kilometer. But one of them has to be true. One of them kind of happens to be

153
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:37,400
true. Consider this one, all the coins in Corey's pocket on March 9th are quarters. I should have

154
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,920
brought some quarters to make this true. This is I have no change in my pocket right now. But

155
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:47,080
suppose I've got a couple of quarters in my pocket, that sentence is true of the entire

156
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,680
class or category of things that it's describing. But that could definitely be some other way,

157
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,360
right? Like if I put a loony in my pocket, it wouldn't suddenly turn into a quarter.

158
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:03,880
So all of these have got the structure that I just described. So it's attributing so all

159
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:11,480
members of the category X have the property Y. If you put these in logical form, they actually

160
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,040
apply to every object in the universe because they say, if something is a coin in Corey's

161
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,320
pocket on March 9th, then it is a quarter. And that's true of literally every object of the

162
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,600
universe. You say that's the chair, it's not a coin in Corey's pocket. Therefore, it's true that

163
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,840
if it's a coin, then it's a quarter, that kind of thing. So these in the kind of logical form that

164
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:40,120
philosophers like to phrase these things, these are all true of literally every object in the

165
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:48,120
universe. But only the top one, only this one about uranium seems to have the sometimes talk

166
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,640
about the modal force of a law of nature. Laws of nature are not supposed to be coincidentally

167
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:59,720
true generalizations. They're supposed to be things that have to be true. Not in a logical sense,

168
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,240
but in a physical, the physical properties of the universe preclude something from being

169
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,720
a uranium sphere bigger than a kilometer. Whereas there's nothing in the laws of nature,

170
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:16,120
as far as I can tell, that requires that there can't be a one kilometer sphere of gold,

171
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,840
or that I could have a coin in my pocket that's not a quarter. That one I'm very confident about.

172
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,000
So these laws are supposed to be universal generalizations, and they're supposed to have this

173
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,320
kind of sort of necessity. So this is the thing that philosophers, I won't spend too much time

174
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:40,680
troubling you about this, but trying to characterize what property this top one has that these other

175
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:47,480
two don't has been a bone of contention. Because if you're an empiricist, if you believe that

176
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,920
all of our knowledge comes through our senses, all you ever observe is something never happening.

177
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:01,880
Like, I never see any gold spheres bigger than a kilometer. That's a true observation,

178
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:08,280
and you don't see the necessity of this, of this uranium thing. Necessity is not something you

179
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:14,760
can observe. You just see that it never happens. So trying to describe what makes one of these

180
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,200
necessary, an actual law, and the other two not laws, is we've been working on it. There's some

181
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:27,800
debate. Okay, so there's laws of nature. The classic view of scientific explanation is that

182
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:34,920
your explanation should involve a law of nature, of this form. So I'd like to introduce you to the

183
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:41,960
deductive, nomological account of explanation. So Carl Hempel and Paul Oppenheim wrote this up in

184
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:50,600
the 40s, mid 40s, presented this as a trying to kind of very clearly say what counts as a scientific

185
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:57,640
explanation. And the basics, the basic idea is a scientific explanation deduces the thing that

186
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:05,800
you want explained from a law of nature and some initial conditions. So what an explanation does is

187
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:11,240
take a law of nature and some specific facts about the world and then deduces the thing you want

188
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,360
explained from that pair. That's what makes something a good scientific explanation.

189
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:24,520
Here's the general form of it. There's a condition or fact. There's a general law,

190
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:30,040
and then you just deduce that from that, from the conditional condition or in general law.

191
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,240
In the explanation literature, we separate the parts of an explanation into

192
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:42,680
explanands and explanandum. I won't make you memorize that, but this is if you want to refer to

193
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:49,320
the thing you want explained, that's the explanandum, and the thing doing the explaining is the explanands.

194
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,320
Okay, so here's an example very similar to the one

195
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,360
Hempel and Oppenheim give. So the explanandum is why did the pipes in my house burst? So you go

196
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:08,200
to your kitchen and you see water pouring out, and you say why, why? Well, here's a condition,

197
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,360
here's a fact of the world. The pipes are made of metal and they're filled with water and it's

198
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:18,680
freezing. So you're allowed to give yourself several facts, but like metal pipes, water in them,

199
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:27,720
freezing cold. And here's two general laws. When water freezes, it expands. When metal gets cold,

200
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,560
it contracts. And you can put those facts and those rules together to get that the pipes are

201
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:39,320
going to break. Hempel's one was like a radiator, but I don't know if I think it's more familiar

202
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:45,880
now than having a radiator filled with water. Okay, so this is what a scientific explanation is,

203
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,520
according to Hempel and Oppenheim. Here's the picture. Here's what it is to explain something

204
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:56,120
scientifically. You take some facts, you take some laws, and you use them to deduce the thing that

205
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:03,240
you're interested in. Yeah, pretty good, right? And then we figured it out and it was all over

206
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,520
and nobody talks about it again. Hey, like it always happens in philosophy. We just come straight

207
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:14,280
to the correct answer and then nobody talks about it anymore. Okay, not really. All right.

208
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:20,760
Okay, so that was their first pass at this, the deductive nomological account, deductive in

209
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:27,240
that you deduce things nomological in that it's law based. Of course, a lot of our scientific

210
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,240
knowledge is not universal in that way, right? The laws of nature that I just showed you are

211
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,920
kind of exceptions because most of our scientific knowledge takes the form of statistical facts.

212
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,640
We know something happens a lot of the time or most of the time or regularly, something like that.

213
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:51,960
So they developed a second model to kind of handle the second style of laws of nature,

214
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:58,520
the inductive statistical method. So instead of deducing the thing to explain what you get,

215
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:04,920
so in a deduction, if you haven't done sort of philosophy stuff, in deductions, you get the

216
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,360
conclusion with certainty. So if the premises are true, the conclusion is certain to be true.

217
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,280
In induction, what you say is, if the premises are true, then the conclusion is likely to be

218
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:23,320
true. So you get a high probability or something like that. So you suppose you've got a tank of

219
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:30,040
water and you drop an ink drop in it, and it spreads out. So why does that happen? Why does

220
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:38,600
the ink spread out? And you can give a really good statistical answer to this. So if you characterize

221
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:45,880
the number of possible states of the system, so all of the ways that the ink can be distributed,

222
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,320
there's just way, way more ways in which it's evenly distributed than if it's like clumped up

223
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:57,880
in one little spot. So if you say the system is randomly chugging through states, it's just going

224
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,960
to go to some random state, there's almost infinitely more states in which it's randomly and

225
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,600
evenly distributed than there are states in which it's clumped up in one corner or something. So

226
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,840
if you drop an ink drop in a thing of water and it all zooms to just one spot, that's super weird.

227
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:22,440
It's not impossible. Statistically speaking, that is a thing that it could do, but it's exceptionally

228
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,560
unlikely. This is by the way the same kind of explanation you'd give if you want to know why

229
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:32,920
is the air in this room roughly evenly distributed? Like why isn't it all pressed down against the

230
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,480
floor or against one wall? The answer is because there's just way, way, way more ways for it to

231
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:46,040
be roughly evenly distributed than there are for it to be pressed up against one wall. And the system

232
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:53,560
is just randomly going through states. If you sat in this room for a trillion, trillion, trillion

233
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:59,240
years, maybe for one second, it would be unevenly distributed. It would mostly be on this side as

234
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,480
it just kind of randomly goes through its states. But you can get that the air is not going to do

235
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,320
that with extremely high probability by doing this kind of statistical explanation. Okay,

236
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,920
so good. We've got the deductive account for things that are always true. We've got the

237
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,440
inductive account for things that are mostly or usually true. Yeah. So in that situation,

238
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:28,760
wouldn't the vacuum created destroy the room? Maybe. It could only be, it could happen for a

239
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:36,920
split second and not destroy the room. I don't know. It's extremely, I'm not super worried about

240
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:42,280
what would happen because it's so hilariously unlikely to happen. We could sit here for many

241
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:50,280
times the age of the universe and it would never happen. Yeah. If you're laying in bed waiting,

242
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,960
worried at night that the air might all suddenly rush to one side of your room,

243
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:02,680
it's you'll be fine. Don't worry. Okay. Okay. So let's do some problems with this. So this,

244
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,080
this was the kind of first pass at this stuff comes out in the 40s. People pretty quickly

245
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:13,800
noticed that there are some issues with both of these accounts. So I started by saying that

246
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,880
there's some big difference between explanation and prediction. Temple actually just goes ahead

247
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,560
and denies this. He says, no, no, no, that's basically the same thing. Because if you can

248
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,120
deduce that something's going to happen, then you've got a prediction that it's going to happen.

249
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,680
The only real difference between an explanation and a prediction for temple is that an explanation,

250
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,960
the thing has already happened. Whereas in a prediction is still in the future. That's it.

251
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:44,920
That's the only difference. But that produces some weird results for his view. For example,

252
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:52,280
the famous flagpole. So if I want to explanation, so we got a flagpole, we got the sun and the

253
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:59,720
flagpole is casting a shadow. So on Hempel's account, you can explain the length of the shadow

254
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,800
by citing the specific position of the sun, and then some universal laws about geometry.

255
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:12,120
You just your, your, you know, grade A geometry lets you predict how long that shadow is going to be.

256
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:22,920
But you can do this the other way as well. Suppose you ask, why is the sun where it is?

257
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:30,040
I want an explanation for the position of the sun in the sky. Well, I know the length of the shadow

258
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:37,560
and the height of the flagpole. And I know some geometry. And I can deduce where the sun is.

259
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:46,120
Now, it's perfectly fine to say you can predict where the sun is based on those facts. That's no

260
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:52,440
worry. But can you explain basis? So say, can you explain to me why the sun is right there? And you

261
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,760
say, well, there's a flagpole, it's this high, and there's a shadow, it's this long. Therefore,

262
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:06,520
that's why the sun is where it is. That's weird, right? That's not why the sun is where it is.

263
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:14,200
But on Hempel's account, that comes out as a good explanation, as good as the other way around.

264
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,080
Like, I'm real happy with like, why is the shadow that long? Like, well, the sun's there and had

265
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:25,320
flagpoles this high. Why is the sun there? You shouldn't know facts about the flagpole are helpful

266
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:31,480
for understanding why the sun is where it is, right? Predicting yes, explaining people like,

267
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:37,240
no, no, no, no, no, that's not that's not going to work. Okay, so the famous flagpole example,

268
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:44,520
people get pretty worried about that. They also get worried about things being cited that are

269
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:50,920
kind of irrelevant. So here's John Jones, John Jones does not have a uterus. But every day,

270
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,760
John Jones takes a birth control pill. And John Jones does not get pregnant.

271
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,920
Good for him. He's very careful. He's very cautious.

272
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,080
He's got no uterus, but he does take birth controls. John Jones fails to get pregnant.

273
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,840
Well, here's a good, here's a good deductive explanation for that.

274
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,800
Anybody who doesn't have a uterus and takes birth control pills will not get pregnant.

275
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,920
John Jones does not have a uterus. He takes birth control pills. Therefore, he does not get pregnant.

276
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,640
Yeah.

277
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:43,560
It's not recommended. Okay, it's not generally recommended. Yeah. But if you're going to ask,

278
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:49,480
why does John Jones not get pregnant, the birth control pills are really a super important

279
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,040
part of the story, right? I mean, maybe the problem is his boyfriend isn't for time.

280
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:04,840
Right. Thank you. Thank you for that. That's okay. So you can cite, so following

281
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,680
Hempel's model to the letter, you can cite stuff that's irrelevant. You can put it into the story,

282
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,960
and it still counts as part of the explanation.

283
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:22,280
Yeah. So you can cite irrelevancies. Another example that he uses, critics of Hempel use,

284
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,800
every morning I have a cup of coffee and I say a magical ritual over it, and then I drink the

285
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:34,680
coffee and it wakes me up. Therefore, saying a magical ritual over my coffee and drinking it

286
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:41,720
is responsible for explains why the coffee wakes me up. Like, yeah, no, it doesn't. You can deduce

287
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,120
it, right? So there's a very strong regularity. Every time you drink a cup of coffee that you

288
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,200
set a little magical ritual over, it does wake you up. So that's a universal regularity.

289
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,440
You can say a law of nature about it if you want. But that's not an explanation.

290
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:06,760
Okay. So diagnosing these problems, philosopher said, okay, here's what you messed up,

291
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:15,000
Hempel, here's what you left out. You can't just cite the universal laws to explain something.

292
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,040
You need to cite the causes of that thing, right? You have to cite the things that caused it to

293
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:29,160
happen. That's the problem with these examples, right? What you're citing are true universal

294
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:36,360
regularities, but you're not citing the causes of things. So yeah, you can explain the length of the

295
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,760
shadow by citing the position of the sun and the height because they caused the length of the

296
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:48,200
shadow. That's what caused the shadow to be where it is, the sun and the flagpole and geometry, I

297
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:54,920
guess. But the length of the shadow doesn't cause the sun to do anything, right? There's no, if you

298
00:30:54,920 --> 00:31:01,240
somehow manipulate the length of the shadow, you're not manipulating the sun, right? So that's the

299
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:06,120
problem with that example. Say, look, you cited a universal regularity, but you didn't cite the

300
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:11,400
causes. You can explain stuff, you got to tell me what caused it. That's the critique.

301
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,280
And again, you can't explain why John Jones feels to get pregnant

302
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,640
because that's not what caused it. That's not the causal story about John Jones not getting pregnant.

303
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,520
If he hadn't taken the pills, he still wouldn't have gotten pregnant. So this is one of the tests

304
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,640
that you do for something being a cause. If it's there, then you get the effect. If you take it

305
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:42,520
away, then you shouldn't get the effect anymore, right? And similar problems appear for the

306
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,560
inductive statistical explanations. You get similar issues. So let me, I don't expect I can do this

307
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:55,640
better than the article. Right. So this is an old-timey example. I don't think

308
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:01,480
syphilis gets talked a lot about anymore, but here's the classic example.

309
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:11,160
Okay. Okay. Then this is topical. All right. All right. So the town mayor suffers from a

310
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,880
motor deficiency characterized by the limitation of certain movements and a loss in muscular strength,

311
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,000
which is called peresis. And we know roughly a quarter of patients with untreated latent syphilis

312
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,120
are victim to peresis. And we know that the mayor has precisely such latent syphilis,

313
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,720
the condition he was not aware of and was constantly not having, consequently not having

314
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,960
treated. Intuitively, what we have here is an explanation of the mayor's peresis, right? Why

315
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:44,280
did the mayor have this muscular condition? Because he had syphilis. However, the law linking

316
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:50,840
syphilis to peresis only brings the, and the fact that the mayor's got syphilis, only brings the

317
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:58,760
mayor's probability up to 25%. And the inductive statistical account doesn't tell us exactly what

318
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:06,760
counts as high probability, but 25% doesn't sound about, doesn't sound right. That doesn't sound

319
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:12,680
like a high probability. It's actually odds are lower than even that he's going to get this condition.

320
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,760
So inductive statistical account said, you explain something by showing how it was very likely.

321
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,240
I mean, the ink blot thing is the ink spreading in water is unimaginably likely. It's so close to

322
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:32,120
100% probable that there's kind of no difference. But this time it's like less than half. It's a quarter.

323
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:42,440
Nonetheless, seems like we can explain why he has peresis based on citing the fact that he's got

324
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,920
untreated syphilis. Yeah? Okay.

325
00:33:53,800 --> 00:34:00,680
Would it depend on there being another way of explaining, like if there was another medical

326
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:07,720
condition that could? Well, in this scenario, so supposing this scenario, this is the cause of

327
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:17,240
his peresis. We know for a fact that syphilis caused his peresis. So if what we wanted of our

328
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:25,560
explanations is the causes, then this is fine as an explanation. And intuitively, most people say,

329
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,560
yeah, that's a good explanation. Why is this guy got peresis? Because he had untreated syphilis.

330
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,280
But on the inductive statistical account, this doesn't work as an explanation because you're

331
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:47,400
supposed to get out that it's got a high probability. So that's weird, right? It's worrisome for the

332
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:54,920
inductive statistical account. Yeah? Yeah, yeah.

333
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,440
They didn't do it that everyone got syphilis in the town.

334
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:05,800
Then you could say, I think it was 100% or it was very likely that 25% would have syphilis.

335
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,960
Good. Okay. So interesting. Now, what you've done is shift the

336
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,360
explanandum there. So you say, why is it the case that 25 people, so if there's 100 people in

337
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:22,280
town with syphilis, why is it the case that there's 25 people with peresis? Now you've got

338
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:29,080
this nice statistical explanation, 25% of cases develop into peresis, and you've got 100 cases,

339
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:33,400
therefore it's very likely that 25 people will have it. Yeah. So if you shift the thing you're

340
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:40,120
trying to explain to the population, then that works nicely. Yeah. But if we're just interested

341
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:45,080
in the mayor, then the inductive statistics, it seems like intuitively, it should still explain

342
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:55,480
why this one specific guy got peresis, and it doesn't seem to do that. Yeah. Good. Okay.

343
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:04,520
So all of the examples I've shown you so far are pretty neatly resolved by just looking at

344
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,000
the causes. Say, how do you explain something? Well, you cite the causes that brought it about.

345
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,600
Ta-da. Pretty good, right?

346
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:24,680
So, but that gets us into some weird and tricky issues. So,

347
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:33,000
like, what does it mean for one thing to cause another thing? It turns out there's a

348
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:39,000
humongous debate about this, especially in complex cases. Yeah.

349
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:45,000
One of the issues is that something always causes another thing to cause effects. So

350
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:52,920
you might know how snow is caused, temperature and stuff, but then you have to ask why. Like,

351
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,560
if there's another, once you know how snow is made, you ask why does water create this, and then

352
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:05,320
why does it just keep going? There is, there is, this is how people end up being philosophers.

353
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,080
They do this, like, why is, okay, say, why is it, why does snow create it? Oh, because

354
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,600
water freezes. Why does water freeze? Because chemical properties. Why does it have those

355
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,960
chemical properties? And then eventually you get to metaphysical questions and

356
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,720
A, people stop talking to you and B, you end up doing philosophy degree. So careful, careful

357
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:28,680
about that. Yeah. In order to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first recreate the universe.

358
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,360
Close Carl Sagan. Very good. That was my best Carl Sagan person.

359
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:41,400
Okay. But even absent this kind of regressive why questions, we've got serious and difficult

360
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,920
questions about assigning causes to things that were pretty sure happened. So what are, what would

361
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:53,560
you say are the causes of the weather today? I mean, you obvious things. There's pressure. There's

362
00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:04,760
season. There's geography. But what we know about weather is that it's unimaginably sensitive to

363
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:14,760
small changes. So if you make an incredibly tiny difference 100 years ago, it, or even 10, 10 days

364
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,240
ago, sometimes it translates into big, big changes in the overall system. So this is one of the

365
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:24,200
things we learned by studying weather simulations. For example, when you run a weather simulation,

366
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:31,400
and you change one variable at the like 10th significant digit, you run it for a little while,

367
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,480
it very quickly diverges to some other state. Yeah, yeah.

368
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,640
That's right. Yeah. So this is the sometimes called the butterfly effect.

369
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,080
It's the idea that a butterfly flaps its wings in the Andes. And then two weeks later,

370
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:55,160
there's rain instead of sun across the world. And that's, I mean, so it's a general property of

371
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,880
complex nonlinear dynamical systems that that's going to be true, or at least some class of them.

372
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,840
And we're pretty confident that it's true of the weather. So if you want to ask, okay, so what's

373
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:11,800
the weather? Why is the weather the way it is today? You might have to talk about the weather on

374
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:19,240
Jupiter 10 years ago. You might have to talk about an errant comet passing beyond the bounds

375
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:26,200
of our solar system. Like, you might have to talk about random quantum mechanical fluctuations in the

376
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:39,960
sun. Like, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So the, the number of factors and the numbers factors, if you say,

377
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:46,360
I want to explain something, okay, great. So just cite the causes. Well, that makes the explanation

378
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:54,840
very quickly expand out to include the whole history of the universe, which is kind of inconvenient.

379
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:01,160
I take it that I mean, the assumption in this is that my assumption is typically that an explanation

380
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:06,360
is something that a human being could give or receive, right? Explanation is something that

381
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:11,880
we do amongst people. And if you have to cite the entire history of the universe since the Big Bang,

382
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,680
that's not going to work for us in any practical sense, right? I take it the scientific explanation

383
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,680
is something that we can do. And if it's suddenly the case that, okay, we figured out that it's

384
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:26,760
got to be causes, but now we just figured out that we can't explain anything because you'd have to

385
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:34,760
describe the entire history of the universe. That's kind of worrying. So Hempel notices this

386
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:41,640
actually. And one way, one way of dealing with this is to just say, look, we got too many causes.

387
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:51,080
The real explanation of any event is actually infinitely complex or practically, for our

388
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,720
practical purposes, it's infinitely complex. And that all that you've ever received or given

389
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:05,560
are what you might call explanation sketches, tiny, tiny, tiny little slices of the real

390
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:14,680
explanation, something like that. Yeah, so it's a weird, it's a weird philosophers move that

391
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:21,560
they get kind of pushed into here. So this, you start out from, hey, people explain things.

392
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,720
I know that you know that we explain things, explain things all the time.

393
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:32,680
How does that work? Well, here's a story. Okay, that story doesn't work. Here's another story.

394
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,920
That story has the consequence that that thing that we started off trying to understand

395
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:45,240
is kind of impossible. In the sense that you can't ever actually explain so you can't give

396
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:52,120
the whole explanation for anything. All you can ever give is the tiniest infinitesimal fraction

397
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:59,560
of the explanatory story. I don't know how you I don't know how you feel about that. I'm a little

398
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,920
uncomfortable with this as a move to sort of turn something very normal and ordinary into something

399
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:11,640
inconceivably complex and unrelated to any human activity. I don't know, you could be okay with

400
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:23,080
that. So this is, yeah, this is the human activity, this end of the front end of the

401
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,720
horse. And then the back end is what the universe is like. It's got much more detail and complexity

402
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,800
than this is what happened. What happened if I tried to draw a horse the front, the front half.

403
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:39,640
Okay, yeah, yeah, okay, so you could have a reverse situation where like the truth is

404
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:45,880
this stranger or sorry, sometimes fiction is stranger than truth, where you have a very boring

405
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:51,480
event that's exaggerated in a way to appear more complex than what actually happened. Okay,

406
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:59,400
that's a possibility, but that's not what's happening here, right? Okay, so causes as explanatory.

407
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,920
They got some issues. There's some serious questions about

408
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:10,760
whether this story is acceptable. They kind of hang on what you mean by cause.

409
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,480
So maybe you're willing to consider something much smaller as the cause of today's weather. So

410
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:22,040
you might say, look, I'm not going to talk about the weather on Jupiter 10 years ago. That's not

411
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,320
part of the story. It's not a big enough factor or an interesting enough factor, something like that.

412
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,880
But now we have to be sort of somewhat more selective. Once again, our interests have kind

413
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:37,080
of come back into the story. Once again, we've sort of been unable to get this clear. I mean,

414
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:43,000
what Hemple was going for was a clear objective criteria for what counts as an explanation.

415
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,040
The story he told us was too simple. And as soon as you start trying to complexify it are

416
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:55,480
what we're interested in gets back into the story. And we'll all develop this a little more next

417
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,120
time. We'll talk a little bit more about causes, what counts as a cause, what counts as a causal

418
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:05,560
explanation. We'll also talk a little bit about whether all scientific explanations have to cite

419
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:12,200
causes. So it might be the case that there are non-causal explanations. So that's our topic for

420
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,320
next time. Okay, that's it for today. Thanks everyone.
