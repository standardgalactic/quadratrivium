 In this discussion, we explored the concept of explanation in science and how it relates to causality. We started with the idea that humans frequently explain events to each other, but we encountered a problem when considering the extent of causal explanations. If every cause since the Big Bang must be included to fully explain an event, it becomes impractical for human understandingâ€”a point that philosopher Carl Hempel noticed.

Hempel initially proposed that there are objective criteria for what constitutes an explanation, but his simple model didn't account for the complexity of human interests and the practical limitations of our explanations. We acknowledged that in practice, we can only provide "explanation sketches" due to the infinite complexity of causes.

The challenge lies in identifying what counts as a cause and whether all scientific explanations must be causal. It's possible that there are alternative forms of explanation beyond the causal model. In our next session, we plan to delve deeper into the nature of causes, discuss what makes a causal explanation, and consider whether non-causal explanations can also be considered scientifically valid. The aim is to clarify the criteria for scientific explanations and understand their role in our pursuit of knowledge.
