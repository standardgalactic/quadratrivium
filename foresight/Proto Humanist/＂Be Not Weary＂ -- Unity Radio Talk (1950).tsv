0	10400	Be not weary from favorite unity radio talks published in Missouri in 1950 by the Unity
10400	12680	School of Christianity.
12680	14480	Be not weary.
14480	16400	Do you tire easily?
16400	21040	Does it sometimes seem that fatigue creeps upon you for no good reason at all?
21040	27720	If you do, may I suggest that you check on your mental habits to see just what they are?
27720	32040	It may come as a surprise to some to learn that habits of the mind have anything to
32040	34400	do with physical tiredness.
34400	36880	Yet many know that this is true.
36880	42200	Many know from personal experience that when we worry, when we are angry or afraid, when
42200	48160	we get too excited or tense, we react by becoming fatigued.
48160	52360	Because we are not in the habit of thinking of fatigue as illness, we do not hesitate
52360	55000	to say, I am tired.
55000	59200	Yet thinking or expressing tiredness is a transgression of the law of life which is
59200	61880	limitless, unceasing energy.
61880	67000	Whenever we think or say, I am tired, we are claiming a negative condition by the use of
67000	72820	the power words, I am, and this thought or spoken phrase reacts on our body as inevitably
72820	77400	as would any other destructive words or thoughts.
77400	81700	Fatigue may not appear to be a sin, but when we let it become a habit, we cannot function
81700	86380	in our highest capacity nor use the gift of life as we were meant to use it.
86380	92140	Jesus said, I came to that, they may have life and may have it abundantly.
92140	96460	When we say, I am tired, we are denying the free-flowing life of God.
96460	100700	When we yield to fatigue in any form, we are not exercising our right to the abundant life
100700	105420	which, by the evidence of his own words, Jesus came to earth to give us.
105420	110140	We students of truth who understand the principle of thought as cause, try to maintain physical
110140	112660	health by refusing to think illness.
112660	115700	Do we follow the same course to maintain physical energy?
115700	117380	Doubtless not.
117380	121460	Most of us have heard faithful followers of spiritual teaching lament their feeling tired,
121460	126920	and many times we ourselves have said, I am too tired.
126920	131260	One truth student told of a personal experience that awakened in her the realization that
131260	133020	fatigue is mental.
133020	137900	She was stretched on a couch, feeling so weary that she did not want to read or move or do
137900	140020	anything but rest.
140020	144020	When the telephone rang, she picked up the receiver listlessly, irritated at having
144020	146020	to make even that small effort.
146020	148780	How about going to the beach for a swim?
148780	149780	A friend asked.
149780	150780	I can't.
150780	152340	I am too tired.
152340	153340	She said.
153340	155820	Oh, come on, urged the friend.
155820	158020	We haven't had a visit for a long time.
158020	161140	Besides, the water will wake you up.
161140	163540	Against her will she let the friend persuade her.
163540	167540	They had a good talk and a long swim, and suddenly she realized that she wasn't tired
167540	170340	anymore but felt stimulated and alive.
170340	172140	She asked herself, why?
172140	176100	The familiar words of the prophet Isaiah came to her mind and provided the answer.
176100	179420	They had that weight for Jehovah shall renew their strength.
179420	181540	They shall mount up with wings as eagles.
181540	183300	They shall run and not be weary.
183300	185620	They shall walk and not faint.
185620	189340	She had become weary because she had let thoughts of imperfection fill her mind and had not
189340	191740	waited on the perfection of the Lord.
191740	195900	When we understand that the Lord faints not nor is weary, that his spirit of life is ever
195900	200460	present in us, we have only to stop thinking fatigue and think of infinite God energy in
200460	203540	order to be revitalized at once.
203540	208460	In the case of the woman just mentioned, her tiredness before the swim was entirely mental.
208460	212300	For had it been physical, the added exercise would have made her more tired.
212300	215980	When her interest was directed away from a negative condition and centered on something
215980	219060	positive, the fatigue disappeared.
219060	223500	Several years ago, for reasons beyond his control, a man who had always been enthusiastic
223500	227860	and happy in his work found he was no longer needed in his chosen profession, and there
227860	231700	followed a period of idleness, worry, and later continuous fatigue.
231700	236100	I can't understand this tiredness, he remarked one day.
236100	240380	When I was working steadily, sometimes as long as ten and twelve hours a day, I never
240380	241940	got tired.
241940	244620	Now I seem to be tired all the time.
244620	249660	The fatigue increased to such proportions that he was advised to consult a truth teacher.
249660	253820	Years later, a friend seeing him was amazed at the change that had come over him.
253820	258260	He looked like his old self, cheerful, enthusiastic, and full of energy.
258260	261780	Upon being questioned about the remarkable change, he explained what had happened in
261780	263340	this way.
263340	268060	At first I was depressed from losing my job, and resentful at the firm for letting me go.
268060	271740	I was so filled with bitterness that I wasn't thinking straight.
271740	276020	Those were the days of massive unemployment, and when I tried for another job, there just
276020	277780	wasn't any to be had.
277780	281540	It was a general condition, but I took it as a personal affront.
281540	285280	Then I began to feel tired all the time, and couldn't even get up enough energy to hunt
285280	286940	for work.
286940	289380	The teacher gave it to me straight from the shoulder.
289380	293660	He said I was letting pity for myself and anger against my former employers occupy my
293660	297180	mind so completely that there wasn't room in it for anything else.
297180	301740	That emotionalism of the kind I was indulging in was the major cause of chronic psychophysical
301740	303860	fatigue.
303860	307260	That there wasn't a thing the matter with me that did determination to stop thinking
307260	311340	destructively wouldn't cure, and that the sooner I'd get interested in something more
311340	315780	important than my own feelings, the sooner I would get back to health and work.
315780	317420	In my heart I knew he was right.
317420	320620	I took myself in hand and refused to worry about a job.
320620	324860	I began physical exercises again, and found that they did not tire me at all.
324860	329180	Then out of a clear sky I was offered work, something different from what I had done before,
329180	330700	but stimulating and remunerative.
330700	336180	I'm working harder now than ever before, and I'm never tired anymore.
336180	340260	These were the words of a man who demonstrated that destructive emotionalism is actually
340260	342660	the cause of much fatigue.
342660	346340	If we are dissatisfied with the work we are doing, and allow ourselves to keep thinking
346340	349580	about it, we feel tired.
349580	354100	If we are discontented with the conditions of our outer life and mentally dwell on them,
354100	356380	we feel tired.
356380	361300	If we allow worry, fear, anger, or any other strong negative emotion to get control over
361300	363240	us, we feel tired.
363240	367600	If we have no absorbing interest in life, but drift idly from day to day in a state
367600	370640	of boredom and unrest, we feel tired.
370640	376680	Whatever the cause, we can get rid of fatigue as we would of any other deviation from perfect
376680	380820	vitality by conscious control of our thinking.
380820	385060	Feeling tired is an insidious habit, which if not broken will gradually weaken the will
385060	386560	to be active.
386560	390640	God did not mean for us to be poor, weak, weary creatures, but filled us with a glorious
390640	392960	dynamic spirit of life.
392960	398440	Some may argue, sometimes after a hard day's work I really do get tired physically.
398440	403600	I haven't been worrying or thinking negatively in any way, and still I feel worn out.
403600	408120	There are times when after extraordinary exertion the body may seem dull and lifeless, a little
408120	411720	rest will quickly cure the physical part of fatigue if the mind is not allowed to dwell
411720	413080	on it.
413080	417320	Complete relaxation of the body, with the mind centered on God as eternal energy, will restore
417320	422120	perfect vitality in a few moments, but no amount of physical rest will help if we continue
422120	423960	to think fatigue.
423960	427560	If you are one of those who have been in the habit of saying I am tired, and if you wish
427560	432120	to avail yourself of the ever ready-strengthened life of God, I suggest a method of treatment
432120	434640	that many have found extremely helpful.
434640	438600	The moment the thought of fatigue enters your mind, stop what you are doing and relax your
438600	441720	body, lying flat on your back if possible.
441720	446320	If lying down is not feasible, you may find a comfortable chair, or else just stand perfectly
446320	447320	still.
447320	451560	Consciously direct your mind to every muscle to make sure that all tension is eased, all
451560	454280	kinks straightened out.
454280	459960	Try to make contact with God by using an affirmation of union, such as I and my Father are one,
459960	463260	or I am in the Father and the Father in me.
463260	468360	Think of God as eternal life, strength, and energy, and direct that energy to your body,
468360	473320	to the fingers and toes first, because they react immediately with a warm tingling sensation
473320	476360	as though an electric current were passing through them.
476400	481360	This manifestation of life pulsating in response to a thought facilitates directing the current
481360	483320	through the rest of the body.
483320	487520	If you have relaxed perfectly, you will find that almost at once the feeling of fatigue
487520	493440	disappears and you are revitalized and ready to carry on with whatever you have to do.
493440	498120	The means by which we break the habit of fatigue is the familiar principle of the transportation
498120	502080	of thought from negative to positive that most of us have been taught to use for the
502080	504360	elimination of all errors.
504360	508880	Not only do we have to deny the fault, but we must steadfastly practice its opposite
508880	509880	virtue.
509880	514320	In the case of fatigue we have to cast out all thoughts of weakness and weariness and
514320	517520	concentrate on divine strength and power.
517520	522700	We can be untiring at all times if we remember to go to the giver of all strength.
522700	527240	We can always manage to pause for a moment at the first sign of fatigue and affirm quietly
527240	529840	that we are quickened with vitality.
529840	534400	In order to break a long-standing habit of feeling or expressing fatigue we shall have
534400	541320	to use daily denials, affirmations, prayers, quote, and let us not be weary and well-doing,
541320	545320	for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.
545320	548240	Let us deny fatigue in this matter.
548240	553960	I have no tired feeling, neither work nor worry, neither the people around me nor the
553960	556080	conditions of my life tire me.
556080	560120	I do not yield to weariness in any form.
560120	565160	I have no tired feeling, neither work nor worry, neither the people around me nor the
565160	566920	conditions of my life tire me.
566920	570240	I do not yield to weariness in any form.
570240	572680	Then let us affirm energy and strength.
572680	575480	Use whatever positive words come into your mind.
575480	579520	Claim your strength is coming direct from God, and therefore limitless, untiring, ever
579520	580680	renewed.
580680	585360	Through your constant awareness of the spirit of life, infinite life, within you every nerve
585360	588520	and cell and muscle can be revitalized.
588520	595960	As Clara Behringer, from Favorite Unity Radio Talks, be not weary.
595960	596480	Thank you.
