1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,400
Be not weary from favorite unity radio talks published in Missouri in 1950 by the Unity

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,680
School of Christianity.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,480
Be not weary.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,400
Do you tire easily?

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,040
Does it sometimes seem that fatigue creeps upon you for no good reason at all?

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:27,720
If you do, may I suggest that you check on your mental habits to see just what they are?

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,040
It may come as a surprise to some to learn that habits of the mind have anything to

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,400
do with physical tiredness.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,880
Yet many know that this is true.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,200
Many know from personal experience that when we worry, when we are angry or afraid, when

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,160
we get too excited or tense, we react by becoming fatigued.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,360
Because we are not in the habit of thinking of fatigue as illness, we do not hesitate

13
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,000
to say, I am tired.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,200
Yet thinking or expressing tiredness is a transgression of the law of life which is

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,880
limitless, unceasing energy.

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,000
Whenever we think or say, I am tired, we are claiming a negative condition by the use of

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,820
the power words, I am, and this thought or spoken phrase reacts on our body as inevitably

18
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,400
as would any other destructive words or thoughts.

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,700
Fatigue may not appear to be a sin, but when we let it become a habit, we cannot function

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,380
in our highest capacity nor use the gift of life as we were meant to use it.

21
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,140
Jesus said, I came to that, they may have life and may have it abundantly.

22
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,460
When we say, I am tired, we are denying the free-flowing life of God.

23
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,700
When we yield to fatigue in any form, we are not exercising our right to the abundant life

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,420
which, by the evidence of his own words, Jesus came to earth to give us.

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,140
We students of truth who understand the principle of thought as cause, try to maintain physical

26
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,660
health by refusing to think illness.

27
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,700
Do we follow the same course to maintain physical energy?

28
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,380
Doubtless not.

29
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,460
Most of us have heard faithful followers of spiritual teaching lament their feeling tired,

30
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,920
and many times we ourselves have said, I am too tired.

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,260
One truth student told of a personal experience that awakened in her the realization that

32
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,020
fatigue is mental.

33
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,900
She was stretched on a couch, feeling so weary that she did not want to read or move or do

34
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,020
anything but rest.

35
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,020
When the telephone rang, she picked up the receiver listlessly, irritated at having

36
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,020
to make even that small effort.

37
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,780
How about going to the beach for a swim?

38
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,780
A friend asked.

39
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,780
I can't.

40
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,340
I am too tired.

41
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,340
She said.

42
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,820
Oh, come on, urged the friend.

43
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,020
We haven't had a visit for a long time.

44
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,140
Besides, the water will wake you up.

45
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,540
Against her will she let the friend persuade her.

46
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,540
They had a good talk and a long swim, and suddenly she realized that she wasn't tired

47
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,340
anymore but felt stimulated and alive.

48
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,140
She asked herself, why?

49
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,100
The familiar words of the prophet Isaiah came to her mind and provided the answer.

50
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,420
They had that weight for Jehovah shall renew their strength.

51
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,540
They shall mount up with wings as eagles.

52
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,300
They shall run and not be weary.

53
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,620
They shall walk and not faint.

54
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,340
She had become weary because she had let thoughts of imperfection fill her mind and had not

55
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,740
waited on the perfection of the Lord.

56
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,900
When we understand that the Lord faints not nor is weary, that his spirit of life is ever

57
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,460
present in us, we have only to stop thinking fatigue and think of infinite God energy in

58
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,540
order to be revitalized at once.

59
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,460
In the case of the woman just mentioned, her tiredness before the swim was entirely mental.

60
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,300
For had it been physical, the added exercise would have made her more tired.

61
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,980
When her interest was directed away from a negative condition and centered on something

62
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,060
positive, the fatigue disappeared.

63
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,500
Several years ago, for reasons beyond his control, a man who had always been enthusiastic

64
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,860
and happy in his work found he was no longer needed in his chosen profession, and there

65
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,700
followed a period of idleness, worry, and later continuous fatigue.

66
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,100
I can't understand this tiredness, he remarked one day.

67
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:00,380
When I was working steadily, sometimes as long as ten and twelve hours a day, I never

68
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,940
got tired.

69
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,620
Now I seem to be tired all the time.

70
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,660
The fatigue increased to such proportions that he was advised to consult a truth teacher.

71
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,820
Years later, a friend seeing him was amazed at the change that had come over him.

72
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,260
He looked like his old self, cheerful, enthusiastic, and full of energy.

73
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,780
Upon being questioned about the remarkable change, he explained what had happened in

74
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,340
this way.

75
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,060
At first I was depressed from losing my job, and resentful at the firm for letting me go.

76
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,740
I was so filled with bitterness that I wasn't thinking straight.

77
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,020
Those were the days of massive unemployment, and when I tried for another job, there just

78
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,780
wasn't any to be had.

79
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,540
It was a general condition, but I took it as a personal affront.

80
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,280
Then I began to feel tired all the time, and couldn't even get up enough energy to hunt

81
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,940
for work.

82
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,380
The teacher gave it to me straight from the shoulder.

83
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,660
He said I was letting pity for myself and anger against my former employers occupy my

84
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,180
mind so completely that there wasn't room in it for anything else.

85
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,740
That emotionalism of the kind I was indulging in was the major cause of chronic psychophysical

86
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,860
fatigue.

87
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,260
That there wasn't a thing the matter with me that did determination to stop thinking

88
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,340
destructively wouldn't cure, and that the sooner I'd get interested in something more

89
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,780
important than my own feelings, the sooner I would get back to health and work.

90
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,420
In my heart I knew he was right.

91
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,620
I took myself in hand and refused to worry about a job.

92
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,860
I began physical exercises again, and found that they did not tire me at all.

93
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,180
Then out of a clear sky I was offered work, something different from what I had done before,

94
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,700
but stimulating and remunerative.

95
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:36,180
I'm working harder now than ever before, and I'm never tired anymore.

96
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,260
These were the words of a man who demonstrated that destructive emotionalism is actually

97
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,660
the cause of much fatigue.

98
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,340
If we are dissatisfied with the work we are doing, and allow ourselves to keep thinking

99
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,580
about it, we feel tired.

100
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,100
If we are discontented with the conditions of our outer life and mentally dwell on them,

101
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,380
we feel tired.

102
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,300
If we allow worry, fear, anger, or any other strong negative emotion to get control over

103
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,240
us, we feel tired.

104
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,600
If we have no absorbing interest in life, but drift idly from day to day in a state

105
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,640
of boredom and unrest, we feel tired.

106
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,680
Whatever the cause, we can get rid of fatigue as we would of any other deviation from perfect

107
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,820
vitality by conscious control of our thinking.

108
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,060
Feeling tired is an insidious habit, which if not broken will gradually weaken the will

109
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,560
to be active.

110
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,640
God did not mean for us to be poor, weak, weary creatures, but filled us with a glorious

111
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,960
dynamic spirit of life.

112
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,440
Some may argue, sometimes after a hard day's work I really do get tired physically.

113
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,600
I haven't been worrying or thinking negatively in any way, and still I feel worn out.

114
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,120
There are times when after extraordinary exertion the body may seem dull and lifeless, a little

115
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,720
rest will quickly cure the physical part of fatigue if the mind is not allowed to dwell

116
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,080
on it.

117
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,320
Complete relaxation of the body, with the mind centered on God as eternal energy, will restore

118
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:02,120
perfect vitality in a few moments, but no amount of physical rest will help if we continue

119
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,960
to think fatigue.

120
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,560
If you are one of those who have been in the habit of saying I am tired, and if you wish

121
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,120
to avail yourself of the ever ready-strengthened life of God, I suggest a method of treatment

122
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,640
that many have found extremely helpful.

123
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,600
The moment the thought of fatigue enters your mind, stop what you are doing and relax your

124
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,720
body, lying flat on your back if possible.

125
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,320
If lying down is not feasible, you may find a comfortable chair, or else just stand perfectly

126
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,320
still.

127
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,560
Consciously direct your mind to every muscle to make sure that all tension is eased, all

128
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,280
kinks straightened out.

129
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,960
Try to make contact with God by using an affirmation of union, such as I and my Father are one,

130
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,260
or I am in the Father and the Father in me.

131
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,360
Think of God as eternal life, strength, and energy, and direct that energy to your body,

132
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,320
to the fingers and toes first, because they react immediately with a warm tingling sensation

133
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,360
as though an electric current were passing through them.

134
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,360
This manifestation of life pulsating in response to a thought facilitates directing the current

135
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,320
through the rest of the body.

136
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,520
If you have relaxed perfectly, you will find that almost at once the feeling of fatigue

137
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,440
disappears and you are revitalized and ready to carry on with whatever you have to do.

138
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,120
The means by which we break the habit of fatigue is the familiar principle of the transportation

139
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,080
of thought from negative to positive that most of us have been taught to use for the

140
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,360
elimination of all errors.

141
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,880
Not only do we have to deny the fault, but we must steadfastly practice its opposite

142
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,880
virtue.

143
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,320
In the case of fatigue we have to cast out all thoughts of weakness and weariness and

144
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,520
concentrate on divine strength and power.

145
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,700
We can be untiring at all times if we remember to go to the giver of all strength.

146
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,240
We can always manage to pause for a moment at the first sign of fatigue and affirm quietly

147
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,840
that we are quickened with vitality.

148
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,400
In order to break a long-standing habit of feeling or expressing fatigue we shall have

149
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:01,320
to use daily denials, affirmations, prayers, quote, and let us not be weary and well-doing,

150
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,320
for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.

151
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,240
Let us deny fatigue in this matter.

152
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,960
I have no tired feeling, neither work nor worry, neither the people around me nor the

153
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,080
conditions of my life tire me.

154
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,120
I do not yield to weariness in any form.

155
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,160
I have no tired feeling, neither work nor worry, neither the people around me nor the

156
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,920
conditions of my life tire me.

157
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,240
I do not yield to weariness in any form.

158
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,680
Then let us affirm energy and strength.

159
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,480
Use whatever positive words come into your mind.

160
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,520
Claim your strength is coming direct from God, and therefore limitless, untiring, ever

161
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,680
renewed.

162
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,360
Through your constant awareness of the spirit of life, infinite life, within you every nerve

163
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,520
and cell and muscle can be revitalized.

164
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:55,960
As Clara Behringer, from Favorite Unity Radio Talks, be not weary.

165
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,480
Thank you.
