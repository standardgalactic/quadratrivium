00:00.000 --> 00:10.400
Be not weary from favorite unity radio talks published in Missouri in 1950 by the Unity

00:10.400 --> 00:12.680
School of Christianity.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.480
Be not weary.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.400
Do you tire easily?

00:16.400 --> 00:21.040
Does it sometimes seem that fatigue creeps upon you for no good reason at all?

00:21.040 --> 00:27.720
If you do, may I suggest that you check on your mental habits to see just what they are?

00:27.720 --> 00:32.040
It may come as a surprise to some to learn that habits of the mind have anything to

00:32.040 --> 00:34.400
do with physical tiredness.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.880
Yet many know that this is true.

00:36.880 --> 00:42.200
Many know from personal experience that when we worry, when we are angry or afraid, when

00:42.200 --> 00:48.160
we get too excited or tense, we react by becoming fatigued.

00:48.160 --> 00:52.360
Because we are not in the habit of thinking of fatigue as illness, we do not hesitate

00:52.360 --> 00:55.000
to say, I am tired.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.200
Yet thinking or expressing tiredness is a transgression of the law of life which is

00:59.200 --> 01:01.880
limitless, unceasing energy.

01:01.880 --> 01:07.000
Whenever we think or say, I am tired, we are claiming a negative condition by the use of

01:07.000 --> 01:12.820
the power words, I am, and this thought or spoken phrase reacts on our body as inevitably

01:12.820 --> 01:17.400
as would any other destructive words or thoughts.

01:17.400 --> 01:21.700
Fatigue may not appear to be a sin, but when we let it become a habit, we cannot function

01:21.700 --> 01:26.380
in our highest capacity nor use the gift of life as we were meant to use it.

01:26.380 --> 01:32.140
Jesus said, I came to that, they may have life and may have it abundantly.

01:32.140 --> 01:36.460
When we say, I am tired, we are denying the free-flowing life of God.

01:36.460 --> 01:40.700
When we yield to fatigue in any form, we are not exercising our right to the abundant life

01:40.700 --> 01:45.420
which, by the evidence of his own words, Jesus came to earth to give us.

01:45.420 --> 01:50.140
We students of truth who understand the principle of thought as cause, try to maintain physical

01:50.140 --> 01:52.660
health by refusing to think illness.

01:52.660 --> 01:55.700
Do we follow the same course to maintain physical energy?

01:55.700 --> 01:57.380
Doubtless not.

01:57.380 --> 02:01.460
Most of us have heard faithful followers of spiritual teaching lament their feeling tired,

02:01.460 --> 02:06.920
and many times we ourselves have said, I am too tired.

02:06.920 --> 02:11.260
One truth student told of a personal experience that awakened in her the realization that

02:11.260 --> 02:13.020
fatigue is mental.

02:13.020 --> 02:17.900
She was stretched on a couch, feeling so weary that she did not want to read or move or do

02:17.900 --> 02:20.020
anything but rest.

02:20.020 --> 02:24.020
When the telephone rang, she picked up the receiver listlessly, irritated at having

02:24.020 --> 02:26.020
to make even that small effort.

02:26.020 --> 02:28.780
How about going to the beach for a swim?

02:28.780 --> 02:29.780
A friend asked.

02:29.780 --> 02:30.780
I can't.

02:30.780 --> 02:32.340
I am too tired.

02:32.340 --> 02:33.340
She said.

02:33.340 --> 02:35.820
Oh, come on, urged the friend.

02:35.820 --> 02:38.020
We haven't had a visit for a long time.

02:38.020 --> 02:41.140
Besides, the water will wake you up.

02:41.140 --> 02:43.540
Against her will she let the friend persuade her.

02:43.540 --> 02:47.540
They had a good talk and a long swim, and suddenly she realized that she wasn't tired

02:47.540 --> 02:50.340
anymore but felt stimulated and alive.

02:50.340 --> 02:52.140
She asked herself, why?

02:52.140 --> 02:56.100
The familiar words of the prophet Isaiah came to her mind and provided the answer.

02:56.100 --> 02:59.420
They had that weight for Jehovah shall renew their strength.

02:59.420 --> 03:01.540
They shall mount up with wings as eagles.

03:01.540 --> 03:03.300
They shall run and not be weary.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.620
They shall walk and not faint.

03:05.620 --> 03:09.340
She had become weary because she had let thoughts of imperfection fill her mind and had not

03:09.340 --> 03:11.740
waited on the perfection of the Lord.

03:11.740 --> 03:15.900
When we understand that the Lord faints not nor is weary, that his spirit of life is ever

03:15.900 --> 03:20.460
present in us, we have only to stop thinking fatigue and think of infinite God energy in

03:20.460 --> 03:23.540
order to be revitalized at once.

03:23.540 --> 03:28.460
In the case of the woman just mentioned, her tiredness before the swim was entirely mental.

03:28.460 --> 03:32.300
For had it been physical, the added exercise would have made her more tired.

03:32.300 --> 03:35.980
When her interest was directed away from a negative condition and centered on something

03:35.980 --> 03:39.060
positive, the fatigue disappeared.

03:39.060 --> 03:43.500
Several years ago, for reasons beyond his control, a man who had always been enthusiastic

03:43.500 --> 03:47.860
and happy in his work found he was no longer needed in his chosen profession, and there

03:47.860 --> 03:51.700
followed a period of idleness, worry, and later continuous fatigue.

03:51.700 --> 03:56.100
I can't understand this tiredness, he remarked one day.

03:56.100 --> 04:00.380
When I was working steadily, sometimes as long as ten and twelve hours a day, I never

04:00.380 --> 04:01.940
got tired.

04:01.940 --> 04:04.620
Now I seem to be tired all the time.

04:04.620 --> 04:09.660
The fatigue increased to such proportions that he was advised to consult a truth teacher.

04:09.660 --> 04:13.820
Years later, a friend seeing him was amazed at the change that had come over him.

04:13.820 --> 04:18.260
He looked like his old self, cheerful, enthusiastic, and full of energy.

04:18.260 --> 04:21.780
Upon being questioned about the remarkable change, he explained what had happened in

04:21.780 --> 04:23.340
this way.

04:23.340 --> 04:28.060
At first I was depressed from losing my job, and resentful at the firm for letting me go.

04:28.060 --> 04:31.740
I was so filled with bitterness that I wasn't thinking straight.

04:31.740 --> 04:36.020
Those were the days of massive unemployment, and when I tried for another job, there just

04:36.020 --> 04:37.780
wasn't any to be had.

04:37.780 --> 04:41.540
It was a general condition, but I took it as a personal affront.

04:41.540 --> 04:45.280
Then I began to feel tired all the time, and couldn't even get up enough energy to hunt

04:45.280 --> 04:46.940
for work.

04:46.940 --> 04:49.380
The teacher gave it to me straight from the shoulder.

04:49.380 --> 04:53.660
He said I was letting pity for myself and anger against my former employers occupy my

04:53.660 --> 04:57.180
mind so completely that there wasn't room in it for anything else.

04:57.180 --> 05:01.740
That emotionalism of the kind I was indulging in was the major cause of chronic psychophysical

05:01.740 --> 05:03.860
fatigue.

05:03.860 --> 05:07.260
That there wasn't a thing the matter with me that did determination to stop thinking

05:07.260 --> 05:11.340
destructively wouldn't cure, and that the sooner I'd get interested in something more

05:11.340 --> 05:15.780
important than my own feelings, the sooner I would get back to health and work.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.420
In my heart I knew he was right.

05:17.420 --> 05:20.620
I took myself in hand and refused to worry about a job.

05:20.620 --> 05:24.860
I began physical exercises again, and found that they did not tire me at all.

05:24.860 --> 05:29.180
Then out of a clear sky I was offered work, something different from what I had done before,

05:29.180 --> 05:30.700
but stimulating and remunerative.

05:30.700 --> 05:36.180
I'm working harder now than ever before, and I'm never tired anymore.

05:36.180 --> 05:40.260
These were the words of a man who demonstrated that destructive emotionalism is actually

05:40.260 --> 05:42.660
the cause of much fatigue.

05:42.660 --> 05:46.340
If we are dissatisfied with the work we are doing, and allow ourselves to keep thinking

05:46.340 --> 05:49.580
about it, we feel tired.

05:49.580 --> 05:54.100
If we are discontented with the conditions of our outer life and mentally dwell on them,

05:54.100 --> 05:56.380
we feel tired.

05:56.380 --> 06:01.300
If we allow worry, fear, anger, or any other strong negative emotion to get control over

06:01.300 --> 06:03.240
us, we feel tired.

06:03.240 --> 06:07.600
If we have no absorbing interest in life, but drift idly from day to day in a state

06:07.600 --> 06:10.640
of boredom and unrest, we feel tired.

06:10.640 --> 06:16.680
Whatever the cause, we can get rid of fatigue as we would of any other deviation from perfect

06:16.680 --> 06:20.820
vitality by conscious control of our thinking.

06:20.820 --> 06:25.060
Feeling tired is an insidious habit, which if not broken will gradually weaken the will

06:25.060 --> 06:26.560
to be active.

06:26.560 --> 06:30.640
God did not mean for us to be poor, weak, weary creatures, but filled us with a glorious

06:30.640 --> 06:32.960
dynamic spirit of life.

06:32.960 --> 06:38.440
Some may argue, sometimes after a hard day's work I really do get tired physically.

06:38.440 --> 06:43.600
I haven't been worrying or thinking negatively in any way, and still I feel worn out.

06:43.600 --> 06:48.120
There are times when after extraordinary exertion the body may seem dull and lifeless, a little

06:48.120 --> 06:51.720
rest will quickly cure the physical part of fatigue if the mind is not allowed to dwell

06:51.720 --> 06:53.080
on it.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.320
Complete relaxation of the body, with the mind centered on God as eternal energy, will restore

06:57.320 --> 07:02.120
perfect vitality in a few moments, but no amount of physical rest will help if we continue

07:02.120 --> 07:03.960
to think fatigue.

07:03.960 --> 07:07.560
If you are one of those who have been in the habit of saying I am tired, and if you wish

07:07.560 --> 07:12.120
to avail yourself of the ever ready-strengthened life of God, I suggest a method of treatment

07:12.120 --> 07:14.640
that many have found extremely helpful.

07:14.640 --> 07:18.600
The moment the thought of fatigue enters your mind, stop what you are doing and relax your

07:18.600 --> 07:21.720
body, lying flat on your back if possible.

07:21.720 --> 07:26.320
If lying down is not feasible, you may find a comfortable chair, or else just stand perfectly

07:26.320 --> 07:27.320
still.

07:27.320 --> 07:31.560
Consciously direct your mind to every muscle to make sure that all tension is eased, all

07:31.560 --> 07:34.280
kinks straightened out.

07:34.280 --> 07:39.960
Try to make contact with God by using an affirmation of union, such as I and my Father are one,

07:39.960 --> 07:43.260
or I am in the Father and the Father in me.

07:43.260 --> 07:48.360
Think of God as eternal life, strength, and energy, and direct that energy to your body,

07:48.360 --> 07:53.320
to the fingers and toes first, because they react immediately with a warm tingling sensation

07:53.320 --> 07:56.360
as though an electric current were passing through them.

07:56.400 --> 08:01.360
This manifestation of life pulsating in response to a thought facilitates directing the current

08:01.360 --> 08:03.320
through the rest of the body.

08:03.320 --> 08:07.520
If you have relaxed perfectly, you will find that almost at once the feeling of fatigue

08:07.520 --> 08:13.440
disappears and you are revitalized and ready to carry on with whatever you have to do.

08:13.440 --> 08:18.120
The means by which we break the habit of fatigue is the familiar principle of the transportation

08:18.120 --> 08:22.080
of thought from negative to positive that most of us have been taught to use for the

08:22.080 --> 08:24.360
elimination of all errors.

08:24.360 --> 08:28.880
Not only do we have to deny the fault, but we must steadfastly practice its opposite

08:28.880 --> 08:29.880
virtue.

08:29.880 --> 08:34.320
In the case of fatigue we have to cast out all thoughts of weakness and weariness and

08:34.320 --> 08:37.520
concentrate on divine strength and power.

08:37.520 --> 08:42.700
We can be untiring at all times if we remember to go to the giver of all strength.

08:42.700 --> 08:47.240
We can always manage to pause for a moment at the first sign of fatigue and affirm quietly

08:47.240 --> 08:49.840
that we are quickened with vitality.

08:49.840 --> 08:54.400
In order to break a long-standing habit of feeling or expressing fatigue we shall have

08:54.400 --> 09:01.320
to use daily denials, affirmations, prayers, quote, and let us not be weary and well-doing,

09:01.320 --> 09:05.320
for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.

09:05.320 --> 09:08.240
Let us deny fatigue in this matter.

09:08.240 --> 09:13.960
I have no tired feeling, neither work nor worry, neither the people around me nor the

09:13.960 --> 09:16.080
conditions of my life tire me.

09:16.080 --> 09:20.120
I do not yield to weariness in any form.

09:20.120 --> 09:25.160
I have no tired feeling, neither work nor worry, neither the people around me nor the

09:25.160 --> 09:26.920
conditions of my life tire me.

09:26.920 --> 09:30.240
I do not yield to weariness in any form.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.680
Then let us affirm energy and strength.

09:32.680 --> 09:35.480
Use whatever positive words come into your mind.

09:35.480 --> 09:39.520
Claim your strength is coming direct from God, and therefore limitless, untiring, ever

09:39.520 --> 09:40.680
renewed.

09:40.680 --> 09:45.360
Through your constant awareness of the spirit of life, infinite life, within you every nerve

09:45.360 --> 09:48.520
and cell and muscle can be revitalized.

09:48.520 --> 09:55.960
As Clara Behringer, from Favorite Unity Radio Talks, be not weary.

09:55.960 --> 09:56.480
Thank you.
