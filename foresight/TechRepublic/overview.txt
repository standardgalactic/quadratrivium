1. **COBOL Overview**: COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) is a decades-old programming language that was developed in the late 1950s and has been used extensively for business, administrative systems for banks, and government applications. Despite being over half a century old, COBOL remains in use today, with an estimated 220 billion lines of COBOL code still operational.

2. **Current Relevance**: COBOL is particularly relevant now due to its presence in critical systems, including those that process unemployment claims. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in unemployment filings, which has highlighted the need for skilled COBOL programmers to maintain and update these systems.

3. **COBOL's Place in Modern Systems**: While modern mainframes are scalable and can handle increased loads through additional CPU resources, many legacy COBOL applications require specific changes to adapt to new regulations or processes, such as those related to the federal government's response to the economic impact of the pandemic.

4. **Skilled Workforce Shortage**: There is a shortage of COBOL programmers due to retirement and the fact that many current developers prefer working with newer technologies. State governments, in particular, may not have the resources or the deep bench of professional developers needed to maintain these systems.

5. **Call to Action**: IBM and the Linux Foundation have launched initiatives to address this shortage. They are offering free COBOL training courses and have established a forum to match experienced COBOL professionals with companies and state governments in need of their expertise. Some positions are paid, and there is also an appeal for volunteers.

6. **Future Learning Resources**: IBM has committed to providing additional learning materials, including videos on platforms like Coursera, to further support the upskilling of COBOL programmers.

7. **Final Appeal**: The message to programmers with COBOL skills is clear: your expertise is still highly relevant and in demand. Whether you're retired or have some COBOL knowledge but feel rusty, your help is needed to manage the increased workload on these systems during this critical time.

8. **Resources for Learning**: For those interested in learning or enhancing their COBOL skills, resources such as IBM's training materials and the talent match portal are available to assist in the process.

In summary, the resurgence of COBOL demand due to the current economic crisis is a testament to the longevity and importance of legacy systems in modern computing. Efforts are being made by industry giants to support and expand the workforce capable of maintaining these systems, and there is an urgent call for experienced professionals to lend their skills.
