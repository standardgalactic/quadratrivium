00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Barry, what can we learn about consciousness from appreciating language?

00:06.000 --> 00:12.000
So when we have consciousness as moments of experience, we think of these as individual, unique,

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
and yet we actually want to capture what's the same or different in our experience over time.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
So we don't just say, here's a visual experience of red.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
We want to say, these are all experiences of the same color red.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
So we use categories and classifications.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
In other words, the passing show can get assembled into larger, more meaningful groups

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
when we use language to classify and categorize.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
But how do we do that?

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
How do we connect up these bits of consciousness with something stable,

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
which is classifying the world and not just my own experience

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
and which is communicable between you and me?

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
So that's part of the fascination about how the two combine.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
But equally, I think we want to say, look, here's something to notice.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
There's something very special that we are the only creatures, the only animals who have language.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
This is a species-specific property.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
And at the same time, we might be the only creatures who not only have minds,

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
but know we have minds and can think about the contents of our own minds.

01:14.000 --> 01:23.000
Now, language, I think, is partly responsible for this way of thinking about the mind, our own, and others,

01:23.000 --> 01:31.000
because when I use a sentence, when I say, the euro is in decline,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
or I hope the euro is not in decline, I might say,

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
I'm using that to both describe a way the world might be,

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
but also to describe the way I see the world.

01:42.000 --> 01:48.000
So notice there's a kind of duality here that we're both describing state of affairs

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
and describing a state of mind that is presenting the world as being in that state of affairs.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
So I think language has got this ability to capture the contents of the mind

02:01.000 --> 02:07.000
and talk about them because I can say, Robert thinks the euro is in decline

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
and now by embedding that statement, the euro is in decline,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
which talks about an economy and a state of Europe,

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
it's also being used to talk about a state of Robert's thinking.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
So I think language is one of the ways in which we codify our own experience,

02:24.000 --> 02:31.000
our own thinking, get hold of it, and are able to use it to represent our own minds

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
and to represent and compare them with the contents of other minds.

02:35.000 --> 02:44.000
So it seems that language then gives us the capacity to transform momentary experiences

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
that we would just see in the moment into general principles that we can relate over time

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
so that we build up categories and meaning from the individual experiences.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
That's right, and I think the way we learn language is probably because

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
we're coordinating our experience with others by jointly attending to the same thing.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
So I mean when you see a parent and a young child and the child's learning language,

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
the child's looking at an object, the parent's looking at an object,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
they're not just happening to look at the same thing,

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
the child goes backwards and forwards from the parent's face to the object,

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
they're jointly attending, and by coordinating their experience,

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
when you introduce a word, it's almost like a sound label for that experience

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
we're both having of that object, a candle, a ball,

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
and then taking that word away and reusing it,

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
it can be like a commemoration or a souvenir, a sound souvenir of that experience,

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
and using the word can recreate in our minds the original experience.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
That's very powerful because now we can take that and it's portable

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
and use it again and again to draw our attention, our own and others,

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
to the same objects in the world and in fact to objects that are no longer present.

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
Now that breaks the connection that most animals are bound by

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
to their present experience and environment.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
We're able to detach, we're able to think about things that are not present,

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
and we're able to compare other parts of our life with now.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
That's a very powerful tool.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
What about situations where language is impaired?

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Is consciousness impoverished in those cases?

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
I think it is. I mean cases where you lose the capacity,

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
and sometimes very strange cases,

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
a case that was discovered here in London by Elizabeth Scharing,

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
a case that was discovered here in London.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
Take a longer pause.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
Sometimes it happens in very bizarre ways.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Take a case that happened here in London,

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
discovered by Elizabeth Warrington and Tim Shallis.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
This is a case of a person who had lost all of their words for fruit and vegetables

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
and just those words.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
So they could talk, they could use language normally,

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
but could not recognize, pronounce or even use words for fruit and vegetables.

05:06.000 --> 05:11.000
That's very strange. It's as if a whole shelf of meanings has just been taken away.

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
And I think that case brought us starkly to terms with the fact

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
that the mind really can be organized a little bit like a modern-day computer,

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
especially where language and meaning is concerned,

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
that there's just this independent way of hooking up to certain classifications.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
And if those go missing, there's not much you can do.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
So if I'm thinking about this relationship between language and consciousness,

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
and I lose some capacity of language, here's my question.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.000
Have I lost a component of consciousness so that I know that I'm me?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I still have the sense of me, but I've just lost something.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
I can't say the names of fruits and vegetables, just like I've lost two fingers.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
I know it's me, I haven't changed, I'm just two fingers less.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
Or is there something really degraded about my personal sense?

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
Two different kinds of things.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Two very different kinds of things.

06:08.000 --> 06:16.000
Again, here we're looking at grades of consciousness and grades of language involving consciousness.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
Because you can have a way in which you've just lost the word for an object,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
but you can still recognize the object.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
So here you've got a form of aphasia, I can't use the word,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
but you can have something much deeper than that,

06:28.000 --> 06:34.000
where you've lost not just the significance of the word as a piece of sound,

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
meaning an object, but you don't recognize the object either.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
So you can have visual agnosias where you lose the whole meaning.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.000
Very obvious cases that sometimes stroke patients can't use the word, glove.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
They've lost the word glove.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
What is that?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
Can't say.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
And it may be just that the word is missing,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
because if you say, is there a glove on the table?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Yes.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Can you reach for it?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
Yes.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
But other people can say, what is that?

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
I've no idea.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
And you show them a glove and you say, what's this for?

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
And they say, I don't know.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Maybe it's for keeping coins in it.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Maybe you put coins of different sizes in these.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
So that shows you, I think, that sometimes using a word like glove,

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
or table, or chair, or glass is actually part of structuring

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
and categorizing the world.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
There's a whole concept that's giving meaningful order

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
to what's appearing in visual consciousness.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
And perhaps the deeper loss of language can actually lead to the lack

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
of the very categories that we use to classify our perceptual experience

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
of the environment.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
But that still doesn't eliminate my own personal sense of things,

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
my own first-person experience.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
It will be degraded in different degrees.

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
But it still won't change the absolute quality that I have and awareness.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
Now, that's interesting because I think that's controversial

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
and that needs to be investigated.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
Is it that the quality of experience stays just the same,

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
that subjective feel of what's going on in me now,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
and I just can't classify or categorize it?

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
Or if we lose the categories, the classification, languages,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
contribution to organizing that consciousness,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
is the consciousness radically different?

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I suspect it is.
