00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
Barry, in discussions between philosophers and neuroscientists there's this great debate

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,840
and what I like to do sometimes is to look at the extremes.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,580
And one extreme which has been called neurophilosophy is that everything in philosophy ultimately

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,560
has to be understood in terms of the brain.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,560
There's nothing else.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,860
Everything else just doesn't exist.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,500
On the other hand, the term has been called neuromania, which is that thinking that everything

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:42,380
in terms of the brain is also a fallacy and that it is the irrigation of brain scientists

9
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,820
to think they can explain everything by the physical activities of the brain.

10
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,940
So how do we compare these two extremes?

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,460
Can we learn anything from that?

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,100
Well, we should be Goudaist Italians and think it's the doctrine of the mean that's

13
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,700
going to be somewhere in the middle.

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,460
Now, neurophilosophy, I don't like the term.

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,420
I think there's neuroscience and philosophy collaborating with one another.

16
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,380
The philosophers should still be philosophers.

17
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,180
That's how they can contribute to the job of the neuroscientists to help understand the

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,900
foundations and the fundamentals of the work.

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,420
Equally the neuroscientists should not be amateur philosophers.

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,940
So I don't like, I like them collaborating.

21
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,500
I don't like them fusing and merging.

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,460
So I do think there's a danger.

23
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,180
Similarly, I think neuroscience is at its worst when it tries to be ultra reductionist.

24
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,060
In fact, some of the best neuroscience today is not reductionist.

25
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,020
Cognitive neuroscience takes very seriously the fact that we're creatures with beliefs,

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,180
desires, wants, wishes, and a range of complex experiences.

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,060
It's not about to sweep that away, but it's trying to explain what might be going on underneath

28
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,220
to give rise to that.

29
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,900
And why does it appear to be the way it does?

30
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,900
That's worth doing.

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,580
Neuroscience, of course, is the favorite label of people who want to point out some

32
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:57,420
of the absurdities that appear in the press every now and then, sometimes from the mouths

33
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,420
of neuroscientists, sometimes from the mouths of journalists reporting neuroscience.

34
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,860
So we hear about everything.

35
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,620
And we hear on neuroscientists have shown us, we know free will, neuroscientists have shown

36
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:13,900
us that beauty is actually located in a particular part of the cortex.

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,060
And when that lights up, that's what it is.

38
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,220
Here's the morality center and so on.

39
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:25,500
Now I do think one should not be attacking the claims of neuroscience at its weakest

40
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,180
or at its loosest.

41
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,500
As philosophers, we have an obligation to attack a position at its strongest.

42
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,300
So you don't go after a straw man.

43
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:41,220
What you should do is think of the very best cases that neuroscience offers as a way of

44
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,340
explaining the mind, the self, human understanding.

45
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,660
And if you still find those wanting, now you're doing real work.

46
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,060
Otherwise, it's a waste of time.

47
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,380
If I look at the concept of neuromania, I could put this proposition to you, either

48
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:03,980
one or the other, not an Aristotelian mean, one or the other, either everything ultimately

49
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,180
can be described in terms of brain processes, your cognitive systems.

50
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,140
I mean, maybe it'll take hundreds of years or a thousand, but ultimately there's neuronal

51
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,340
impulses and synaptic activity and what else is there?

52
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,340
There's the body.

53
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,340
There's the body, e.g.

54
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,900
But that has to be fed back into the system.

55
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,900
That's true.

56
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,900
I mean, you have to have that feedback.

57
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,900
Right.

58
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,900
We have to feedback.

59
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,700
But notice, you're not going to understand an awful lot of the brain activity unless

60
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,740
you correlate it with things going on in the environment.

61
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
And changes in the body.

62
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,740
But that has to be coded into neuronal impulses.

63
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,540
Indeed it has, but sometimes we let the world take the strain.

64
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,300
We don't have to have internal representations of everything going on in the world.

65
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,860
That would be too expensive.

66
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,700
We make use of triggers and signals out there in the world that the brain resonates with

67
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:55,780
or responds to, and we can allow the world to be an external representation for us.

68
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,860
I mean, we've got this concept in philosophy of the extended mind.

69
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,620
When you keep a diary, when you have computer records, when you have your mobile phone,

70
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,740
these are ways in which you've got external memory to keep track of things in the environment.

71
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,980
They're not going on in your brain, but your brain is definitely making use of them.

72
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,140
If we didn't have the brain, these would be meaningless squiggles and symbols.

73
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,620
But it's very obvious that we've got to think of the brain in its location.

74
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,620
Brains are built by genes, and genes are built by creatures in environments, biological

75
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,980
creatures that occupy certain niches that are subject to certain forces.

76
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,140
Now you've got to put the whole thing together.

77
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:43,140
So I think if neuroscience starts to aggregate the whole of science to itself, as it were

78
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,540
becoming a neo-physics, then that's no good.

79
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,740
But equally, physics doesn't give us the whole explanation of human beings.

80
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,620
It might be that everything in the world is ultimately physical stuff, but there isn't

81
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,860
just one theory of that stuff.

82
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,980
Similarly, there isn't just one theory of what it is we do as human beings.

83
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:03,900
But boy, neuroscience is very important as a component of the overall theory of mind,

84
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,940
of extended mind, of culture, of language, of all the things that go together to make

85
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,060
us uniquely human.

86
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,340
But when you have extended mind, whatever is in your diary, whatever is in the environment

87
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,420
is ultimately encoded in some signal that is in your brain.

88
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,660
It's responded to, but we don't have perfect encoding.

89
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,820
So for example, let me give you an example of this.

90
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:34,180
So when the visual system is calculating distance and depth in the environment from

91
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,260
retinal disparity, it's making certain assumptions.

92
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,020
One of the assumptions is that objects are stable under rotation, that they don't change

93
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,220
shape as you move them.

94
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,380
But there's no part of the brain where it's got that assumption written in.

95
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:54,100
It functions well as long as it's in an environment in which objects are stable under rotation.

96
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,140
If you took that brain to a different environment where they were not, vision wouldn't do the

97
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,140
same job.

98
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,140
It would break down.

99
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,140
That's why you have visual illusions, fun houses at amusing parts.

100
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,140
Exactly so.

101
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:07,460
But it also shows you why some part of what we are calling the assumptions of the way

102
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,820
things work are distributed jointly between the brain and the environment.

103
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,740
It's a collaboration.

104
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,740
Which is an efficient way to operate.

105
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,740
Absolutely.

106
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,660
Let the world take the strain.

107
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,060
And so what are the implications of that between the two extremes?

108
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,740
Between the two extremes then I think neuromania is attacking a straw man because anybody who

109
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,980
thinks that neuroscience is going to give us the full explanation of the human condition

110
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:37,380
and our location in the world and our dealing with the environment is over describing their

111
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,180
ambitions and their case.

112
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,300
But therefore we don't need to worry about that.

113
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,100
Neuroscience, together with many other sciences and philosophy, I think are going to make

114
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,980
real progress.
