0	4840	of the ape was able to do things that made them think,
4840	7720	oh, he's asking for a banana.
7720	10120	But when they looked at it closely,
10120	12200	the nymph was just producing signs
12200	14840	which somehow got him what he wanted sometimes.
23840	26680	Welcome to Closer to Truth Chats.
26680	29640	Today I'm speaking with Noam Chomsky,
29640	31840	the distinguished theoretical linguist,
31840	34480	analytic philosopher, cognitive scientist,
34480	36320	and public intellectual.
36320	39200	He is Institute Professor Emeritus at MIT
39200	41400	and Laureate Professor of Linguistics
41400	43480	at the University of Arizona.
43480	46960	Closer to Truth is presenting this four-part mini series
46960	48680	with Professor Chomsky.
48680	52480	Part four now covers applications of Chomsky's
52480	55560	linguistic theories to other fields and issues
55560	58120	and his thoughts, opinions, reflections
58120	61360	on Closer to Truth themes and big questions.
61360	64600	So Noam, let's begin with an overview of what
64600	66160	has been called, what you've been called,
66160	68280	the basic property of language.
68280	70720	And it's three parts that you've
70720	74440	talked about, the internal computational system that
74440	77840	has hierarchically structured, the sensory motor system
77840	80480	that expresses through externalization, speaking,
80480	84600	et cetera, and then this internal conception system
84600	88160	for inference, interpretation planning, what
88160	91200	is we informally call thought.
91200	96120	So just want to get your sense of this big picture of language.
96120	100360	If you take a look at the human species,
100360	107520	what sharply differentiates it from any organic species
107520	112520	we know of are two things, possession of language,
112520	115880	possession of thought in any form
115880	119760	that we can grasp what thought is.
119760	124840	I have two identifying features of a species.
124840	127400	First question that comes to mind
127400	130080	is what's their relation?
130080	133840	Simplest relation would be identity.
133840	137880	And in fact, that's a fair statement.
137920	142960	It's been understood through history for millennia actually
142960	147760	that language and thought are intimately related.
147760	152400	Language has historically been called audible thought.
152400	155960	It's the mechanism for constructing
155960	160240	thoughts over an infinite range which we then
160240	164560	can access and use in our various activities.
164600	169680	The internal nature of until the 20th century
169680	174480	when mathematical theories of computation
174480	178560	were developed clearly and precisely,
178560	184480	it was very difficult to capture the essence of this system.
184480	187800	The last 70 years, we've been able to do it.
187800	191840	What we need, what is somehow coded in our brains
191840	198560	is a finite procedure, kind of like a program in your laptop,
198560	201640	a finite procedure which generates
201640	207200	an infinite number of hierarchically structured
207200	212880	expressions, each of which is an expression of thought
212880	220080	and which can be externalized into some sensory motor medium.
220120	226160	Usually sound could be sign, could even be touch,
226160	228160	sound is the usual one.
228160	232200	That seems to be the basic character of language.
232200	235640	It's not quite the instrument of thought.
235640	238360	It is thought.
238360	242360	We have thought insofar as we have language.
242360	245840	In any significant sense of thought,
245840	248440	there are a couple of dogs at my feet
248440	254640	and they have a kind of thought, but it's finite bounded.
254640	257200	If I say a couple of certain words,
257200	262280	I can say which I won't say and they'll be running to the door.
262280	265800	It's a sort of thought, but it's not what we're doing now
265800	270280	or what humans do normally, constructing modes,
270280	276560	expressions that can be used for reflection, analysis,
276560	282760	planning, inference, all the things that our minds uniquely do.
282760	287520	They basically do with language or with instructions
287520	292040	that language provides to other cognitive systems,
292040	297760	just as the internal language that we have
297760	303000	provides instructions to the articulatory system, which
303000	306960	we can then pick up and use to pronounce things.
306960	312080	Sort of similar on the side of conceptual analysis,
312080	314680	reflection, thought generally.
314680	317520	That seems to be the general picture.
317520	322960	So if this basic property is really basic,
322960	326040	where and when did it first appear?
326040	329960	I think you've written so much, I'm not sure when this occurred,
329960	333680	but you've said that the origin of mind-dependent,
333680	337240	word-like elements remains a mystery.
337240	338800	Other people don't think it's a mystery,
338800	341200	but you still think it's a mystery?
341200	342640	Total mystery.
342640	345320	We have no idea.
345320	347760	But we know a lot about it.
347760	352880	So for example, Lyleg Leitman's work
352880	358240	died recently, an outstanding cognitive psychologist
358240	359760	and linguist.
359760	367400	She, her work showed that a child of maybe two or three
367400	371080	has an enormous knowledge of language
371080	374000	well beyond anything it can express,
374000	376680	and particularly with regard to words.
376680	380800	Children pick up words at a fantastic rate.
380800	385920	At that age, they may be picking up one word every waking hour,
385960	390320	pick up on very few presentations, no training,
390320	392880	nothing like that, very little evidence.
392880	397960	And they know the words and all of their richness and complexity.
397960	400920	Then comes the second part, investigating
400920	402880	the character of the words.
402880	406800	And it turns out even the simplest ones, the ones we use
406800	410000	to refer to the things around us,
410000	413680	have rich, complex, internal structure.
413720	416640	So there's a question, two questions.
416640	418960	One, a question of acquisition.
418960	421200	One, a question of evolution.
421200	425160	Question of acquisition is how infants
425160	430280	are able to hit upon the rich, complex notions
430280	433600	that they have mastered at a very early age
433600	435480	with very little data.
435480	436960	One question.
436960	442440	The other question is, where in human evolution did this arise?
442440	447120	Well, my own feeling for a long time
447120	453840	was that this was lost in the midst of pre-human history.
453840	456840	I think now that that's mistaken.
456840	460720	If these complex concepts, even notice
460720	468360	that even the simplest concepts, tree, desk, person, dog,
468360	471920	whatever you want, even these are extremely complex
471920	473800	in their internal structure.
473800	479960	If such concepts had developed in proto-human history
479960	484080	when there was no language, they would have been useless.
484080	488720	They would have been an accident if they developed,
488720	491560	and they would quickly have been lost because you
491560	493720	can't do anything with them.
493720	498160	So chances are very strong that the concepts developed
498160	501840	within human history at a point where
501840	508200	we had computational systems which satisfy the basic property,
508200	511680	well, that reduces the mystery somewhat.
511680	517720	It means it was within the last couple hundred thousand years,
517720	522360	which is a blink of an eye in evolutionary time.
522360	526120	Anthropological research has succeeded
526120	530640	in giving a fair amount of information
530640	535960	about up to 20,000 or 30,000 years ago
535960	539240	how indigenous cultures, they were quite rich,
539240	543680	indigenous cultures developed and operated.
543680	548160	So this kind of narrowed the time window
548160	554440	in which this evolution presumably took place.
554440	559760	That doesn't solve the problem, but it makes it a little more feasible.
559760	565880	It's during this era that we do begin to get complex, symbolic behavior,
565880	571600	fantastic artwork, evidence of complex societies,
571600	576120	and so on, roughly in this period about 100,000 years.
576120	582760	Would you use the term human to whatever primates were prior
582760	588160	to that language explosion or that language event?
588160	590760	Well, these are just technical usages.
590760	596440	Those are hominids, hominids, homo sapiens,
596440	600160	especially our species, separate species.
600160	606360	Its origins seem to be in the order of two to 300,000 years ago.
606360	611120	Co-terminal with language?
611120	614720	Well, that we don't know, but there's evidence.
614720	618600	Prior to the appearance of homo sapiens,
618600	622520	there's no evidence in the archeological record
622520	626720	for any significant symbolic behavior,
626720	632840	maybe a mark on a stone or something.
632840	638040	The kind of complex behavior that seems to require language
638040	644240	doesn't appear before homo sapiens, so that it puts one kind of bound.
644240	646920	We have another firmer bound.
646920	653120	Genomic analysis has now placed the separation of humans
653120	657400	at about at least 150,000 years ago.
657400	661000	So we're now down to a very brief period,
661000	666520	and all known humans have the same language faculty.
666520	673720	So it seems clear that the language faculty existed
673720	677880	before the early separation of humans,
677880	680280	which leaves a very small window.
680280	684800	It means something pretty simple must have happened.
684800	690280	50,000 years sounds like a large number, but not in evolutionary time.
690280	692840	In terms of the purpose of language,
692880	696240	it's generally assumed by evolutionary biologists
696240	700480	that communications is the primary purpose,
700480	704640	the driver of it, with analogs from animal communications,
704640	711480	whether bird songs or monkey calls that that evolved into human language.
711480	714200	I think you've taken quite the opposite position,
714200	717160	which is not unusual for you to take opposite positions,
717160	723440	that language is more an inner mental tool as its driver,
723440	731000	or as what it was, as opposed to a linear evolution of communications capabilities.
731000	735640	Well, let me first step back a step.
735640	742520	Talking about the purpose of a biological system is not really appropriate.
742520	745800	Biological systems don't have purposes.
745800	750760	They appear, then maybe they're put to use in one or another way.
750760	755800	But if you look at the process of evolution, it really has three stages.
755800	761280	The first stage is something disrupts the existing system,
761280	767000	maybe a mutation, maybe symbiosis.
767000	773120	So, sometime a couple billion years ago,
773120	780120	a billion years ago, a bacterium swallowed another microorganism
780120	783920	that led to a disruption of the system.
783920	786680	It's the beginning of eukaryotic cells.
786680	789920	The basis for complex life was an accident.
789920	792720	Well, first the system gets disrupted.
792800	796360	Then the second stage, nature,
796360	801120	tries to form the simplest, most elegant solution
801120	803960	to how to deal with this new phenomenon.
803960	805960	That's the second stage.
805960	812680	The third stage is winnowing of the various things that are around,
812680	819880	which ones are going to have higher reproductive success, natural selection.
819880	823120	Let me take a look at the language.
823120	828080	The initial stage, some stage of disruption,
828080	833160	evidently produced a recursive function,
833160	837160	a computational procedure that goes on,
837160	840960	that can be coded on a computer effectively.
840960	843880	It's basically what a recursive function is.
843880	847280	So, the first stage that appeared somehow,
847280	851040	presumably some small rewiring of the brain,
851040	853840	led to the appearance of this.
853840	860360	Second stage, nature formed the best possible solution
860360	864120	to how to incorporate this into the brain.
864120	867600	Well, the goal of contemporary linguistics
867600	870520	is to find out what that system is.
870520	873080	But what about the winnowing stage?
873080	875480	That never came for language.
875480	878240	There never was any choice.
878240	881920	Partly maybe because there just wasn't enough time,
881920	885160	but partly for, probably for a deeper reason.
885160	891680	When you look into this system that nature constructed in detail,
891680	895680	you find that it's so tightly integrated,
895680	898480	so elegantly put together,
898480	902960	that any modification of it in the whole system collapses.
902960	905760	So, there was just no way to select.
905760	909600	It looks as if selection just didn't operate for language.
909600	913640	At least the core parts of it, it certainly may operate
913640	915520	for peripheral parts.
915520	918240	Now, if we look back at the,
918240	922960	so I think we can't really talk about the purpose of the system.
922960	925400	We can talk about how it's used.
925400	929240	Okay, now if you take a look at how language is used,
929240	931640	sometimes it's used for communication,
931680	933960	like you and I are doing,
933960	936960	but that actually is a very peripheral use.
936960	941240	Almost all of our use of language goes on.
941240	945560	All of our waking hours, most of our sleeping hours,
945560	947680	is just thinking.
947680	950920	We just can't stop, almost impossible to stop.
950920	955240	It takes a tremendous act of will to stop thinking.
955240	958240	That's our overwhelming use of language.
958360	961600	We don't know, we only know what's going on there
961600	963320	from the outside.
963320	965680	We can't introspect into it.
965680	969880	What we call inner speech is not inner speech.
969880	972520	It's externalized speech,
972520	976200	where the articulatories have been put on hold.
977800	978920	What's actually going on,
978920	980920	we can only discover the way you discover
980920	984560	how the visual system works from the outside.
984560	987200	And that's basically what linguistics is about.
988040	990280	At least the kind that interests me.
990280	992920	Try to find out what this system is
992920	995320	that Mother Nature put together
995320	997720	that is used entirely for thought.
997720	999920	Now there are other reasons for thinking
999920	1004600	that communication is a peripheral use of language.
1004600	1008320	When you look at the nature of this internal system,
1008320	1011600	you find that there are conflicts
1011600	1016680	between computational efficiency
1016760	1018800	and communicative efficiency.
1019680	1022680	And in every single case,
1022680	1026000	communicative efficiency is sacrificed
1026000	1029280	as if nature just didn't care.
1029280	1032720	It only cared about computational efficiency,
1032720	1036560	constructing a beautiful internal system,
1036560	1039720	which is typically the way evolution works.
1039720	1043000	That's how evolution generally works
1043000	1044880	for perfectly good reasons.
1044880	1048240	During the second stage of reconstruction,
1048240	1050440	nature can't have any idea
1050440	1052840	how the organism's gonna put it to use
1052840	1054880	to take a ridiculous example
1054880	1058680	when nature was designing human beings.
1058680	1062560	It didn't design ears so that they could keep masks.
1064320	1065800	Just didn't care.
1065800	1067080	And it probably didn't care
1067080	1070200	that humans could use language for communication.
1070200	1073640	That's the way things seem to be developing.
1073640	1075240	There is actually no,
1075240	1077880	the only reason to believe that language
1077880	1079320	is used for communication,
1079320	1082040	which is a modern idea incidentally,
1082040	1085600	is misinterpretations of evolution.
1085600	1087600	It somehow must have developed,
1087600	1090840	you language must develop out of animal systems,
1090840	1092560	communication systems.
1092560	1094920	I believe no reason to believe that.
1094920	1095760	None.
1095760	1099080	And the evidence is overwhelmingly that it didn't.
1099080	1103560	There's nothing similar to the basic elements
1103560	1106480	of language, either the conceptual elements
1106480	1108920	or the computational ones.
1108920	1111800	Nothing similar in the animal world.
1111800	1115640	Animal communication differs from human use of language
1115640	1117960	in radical ways.
1117960	1121160	And if the course of evolution was,
1121160	1125120	as I recently suggested a few moments ago,
1125120	1126440	it's not gonna have any connection
1126440	1127880	with animal communication.
1128760	1131520	Now there, I should say that,
1131520	1134800	there's a kind of a baby talk Darwinism,
1134800	1137480	which isn't evolutionary theory
1137480	1140040	that holds that any complex system
1140040	1144320	must have developed in very small steps from earlier ones.
1144320	1147240	Actually Darwin himself believed that,
1147240	1150240	but that's been shown to be untrue.
1150240	1155240	There are many sharp changes in evolutionary history
1155480	1158960	from disruptions of one kind or another,
1158960	1162440	like eukaryotic cells or mutations and so on,
1162440	1164080	and many other things.
1164080	1167880	So are we saying that those who claim that language
1167880	1171560	is the result of a transformation
1171560	1175120	of animal language, animal communication?
1175120	1180120	But does that mean that they are bringing to the question,
1180320	1183400	what I can only call an ideological bias
1183440	1188440	that language has to be the small increment development
1188840	1193840	of what looks similar in previous animals?
1195760	1198360	First of all, it doesn't look similar.
1198360	1201080	It looks radically different.
1201080	1206080	The most elementary features of language
1206240	1210440	have no analog whatsoever in the animal world.
1211440	1214680	And remember, our closest relatives,
1214680	1218680	the higher apes are actually about 12 million years
1218680	1221360	separate from us in evolutionary time.
1222440	1225120	So throughout this, they've evolved.
1225120	1229040	Our common ancestors about six million years ago,
1229040	1231840	they've evolved, we've evolved.
1231840	1236680	It's impossible to teach with most intensive efforts.
1237200	1242200	Impossible to teach the most elementary mimicry of language,
1243720	1245440	even to higher apes.
1245440	1248760	Every effort that's been tried has been a total failure.
1249600	1251920	It's just a common myth.
1251920	1253760	There's no evidence for it.
1253760	1256160	What about, I mean, there are claims
1256160	1259680	that animals of parrots and chimps
1259680	1264680	have a rudimentary number of words they understand.
1266880	1270360	You know, your namesake, Nym Chomsky, if I...
1270360	1275360	Nym Chomsky, how do you interpret that?
1275360	1279160	It's also true of my dogs, they do better.
1279160	1282800	The Nym project was a very interesting project.
1282800	1285200	Very fine scientists involved,
1285200	1289440	number of them, close friends, former students even.
1289440	1294440	They tried very hard to raise a chimp from infancy
1295440	1297800	about the way a human child is raised,
1297800	1300120	as close to it as they could come.
1300120	1303000	They worked very hard, very seriously.
1303000	1306120	For a long time, they thought they were making progress.
1307120	1310280	Later, when they reviewed their evidence,
1310280	1311800	they were very careful.
1311800	1315240	They had a video record of everything that happened.
1315240	1319040	When that was analyzed, it turned out that it was zero.
1320040	1324040	The ape was able to do things that made them think.
1324880	1327760	Oh, he's asking for a banana.
1327760	1330120	But when they looked at it closely,
1330120	1335120	turned out that the ape was making random signs.
1335480	1338400	Maybe banana was in there,
1338400	1342000	want was in the, a bunch of other things were there,
1342000	1346120	but the investigators were interpreting it
1346120	1348480	as Nym wants a banana.
1348480	1350560	Nym was just producing signs,
1350560	1353840	which somehow got him what he wanted sometimes.
1353920	1358080	In fact, it turned out that even the most elementary concept
1358080	1363080	of an object was Nym could never learn.
1363360	1368360	He had a symbol for apple, but for Nym, it meant an apple,
1369440	1371360	the place where an apple was,
1371360	1374160	something was near the apple,
1374160	1376480	anything associated with apple,
1376480	1378680	concept apple was impossible.
1379800	1381440	So, and this has been true.
1381440	1386400	There are a lot of claims about animal achievements,
1386400	1390080	but where investigators have been willing
1390080	1395080	to provide actual data, primary data,
1395720	1397720	there's nothing that you can't find anything,
1397720	1399960	which is not very surprising.
1399960	1403600	It wouldn't be easy to teach us to behave like apes,
1404520	1406280	which is not ready to build for it.
1406280	1407600	We didn't evolve to it.
1407600	1410640	I know some people that would be probably pretty easy
1410680	1412520	to teach them how to behave like apes,
1412520	1417520	but that may be just a commentary on my friends.
1419160	1424160	Nym, you have brought into scientific thinking
1424280	1426400	the concept of deep structure.
1426400	1429600	I know that affected me many decades ago,
1429600	1431920	and I started thinking intellectually about the brain
1431920	1434640	and about the way everything is structured
1434640	1437000	and the concept of deep structure
1437000	1439840	you have embedded in intellectual content.
1439840	1442080	Now, you later modified that in terms of language,
1442080	1443360	in terms of minimalism.
1443360	1445040	We talked about that in the earlier parts,
1445040	1448360	but what I'd like you to do is just reflect
1448360	1453000	on the power of the deep structure paradigm
1453000	1457320	in many diverse fields from architecture, music, politics,
1457320	1459960	which I know you've had some association with,
1459960	1461920	certainly cognitive science,
1461920	1464920	this way of thinking of deep structure.
1464920	1467080	Just want to get your sense of it.
1467080	1472080	It's a concept that is ubiquitous in the sciences.
1473640	1475800	So if you look at a,
1475800	1478520	suppose I drink a glass of water,
1478520	1483520	well, I have no idea what the components of it are.
1485400	1489000	There is an internal underlying structure.
1489000	1492400	There's hydrogen atoms, oxygen atoms,
1492400	1494200	lots of other things,
1494200	1497360	all put together in a complex form
1497360	1500280	with an underlying rich structure,
1500280	1502880	which I don't see.
1502880	1504720	You have to do complex.
1504720	1508480	It took centuries of serious investigation
1508480	1511600	to discover what the internal structure
1511600	1514520	of a water molecule is, okay?
1514520	1516240	That's deep structure.
1516240	1519840	All over, we don't see the nature of things.
1519840	1524320	We see peripheral superficial aspects of them.
1524320	1526040	Language is the same.
1526040	1529060	We don't see its internal nature.
1529060	1532120	We see superficial aspects.
1532120	1535900	And deep structure happened to be a technical notion
1535900	1537920	which had a specific meaning,
1537920	1542920	but the general idea that there is a hidden inner form,
1543560	1547200	internal structure, not visible to us,
1547200	1549960	but only can be discovered
1549960	1553520	through intensive inquiry and investigation.
1553520	1556640	That's a ubiquitous concept.
1556640	1558960	And it was understood in the study of language
1558960	1562840	in the 17th and 18th century.
1562840	1564000	It was forgotten.
1564000	1566360	But if you go back to the origins
1566360	1568920	of the scientific revolution,
1568920	1573080	Galileo or no, Descartes, others,
1573120	1577520	they recognized that there's a inner form to language
1577520	1579080	that we don't see.
1579080	1582880	Famous Fort Royal Grammar, 1660.
1582880	1583920	I don't know.
1583920	1588920	Others, it had something comparable to deep structure.
1589160	1590560	They didn't call it that.
1590560	1593400	And they didn't have the means at the time
1593400	1597160	to develop a computational theory that came later.
1597160	1601320	For example, one of the examples in the Fort Royal Grammar
1601960	1606960	is the sentence, invisible God created the visible world.
1607800	1612800	And they argue that underlying this are three propositions.
1614080	1616080	God is invisible.
1616080	1617560	The world is visible.
1618720	1620480	God created the world.
1620480	1625480	And some kind of operations turned these internal propositions
1625480	1628960	into invisible God created the visible world.
1628960	1630960	It's pretty similar to deep structure.
1632240	1633440	That's a great example.
1634480	1639160	The cognitive science revolution transformed,
1639160	1640720	really it's transformed our lives.
1640720	1643280	It certainly transformed understanding
1643280	1645480	how we think in the human sciences
1645480	1647120	and of course all the computer sciences,
1647120	1650760	your work in linguistics is given credit
1650760	1655040	for at least in part, triggering that revolution.
1655040	1656800	Why is that the case?
1656800	1660640	Well, first of all, I hate to be a contrarian all the time,
1660640	1664880	but my own view is that the real cognitive revolution
1664880	1667480	took place in the 17th century,
1667480	1670200	along with the rise of modern science.
1670200	1673880	It's been mostly forgotten, but there were real achievements.
1673880	1676680	Started mentioning some, there are many others.
1676680	1679040	I've done a fair amount of work on that.
1679040	1683120	The second cognitive revolution in the 1950s,
1683120	1687280	developed mainly in Cambridge mass
1687280	1690620	where I happened to be a grad student at the time.
1691340	1695020	If you look at what constituted it,
1695020	1698860	there were basically two things.
1698860	1703060	Jerry Fodor, late friend, important cognitive science
1703060	1707540	and philosopher, at once quipped that cognitive science
1707540	1712540	is the study of language and vision, not totally false.
1712860	1715380	Those are the fields that really developed
1715380	1719180	a lot of rich investigation of how visual perception
1719220	1723900	takes place, a lot of study of the nature of language.
1723900	1726780	And it was all integrated, we all know each other.
1726780	1731820	So Dave Maher is one of the founders of modern visual
1731820	1735420	science, we were friends and some of his work
1735420	1738100	was kind of modeled on some of the things
1738100	1739980	that were being done in language,
1739980	1743980	but a lot of integration.
1743980	1748220	So it's kind of understandable.
1748220	1753140	These are two topics that you sort of know how to study.
1753140	1756020	Other things are very hard to study,
1756020	1759100	like for example, the nature of concepts.
1759100	1762260	That's a tough one to try to figure out,
1762260	1764540	what is the nature of the concept,
1764540	1768820	tree, river, house, and so on.
1768820	1773580	Actually here the classical Greece had some answers,
1773580	1775300	which have been forgotten.
1775300	1779540	So Aristotle considered this question
1779540	1783620	in a different framework and his framework was metaphysical.
1783620	1787820	So not what's the meaning of house, but what is a house?
1787820	1790660	It was the cognitive revolution of the 17th century
1790660	1793500	that shifted that from metaphysics
1793500	1796980	to epistemology to cognition.
1796980	1801980	But in forgetting that Aristotle asks, what's a house?
1801980	1806900	He says it's a combination of matter and form.
1806900	1811700	The matter is the bricks, the timbers, and so on.
1811700	1817260	The form is the design, characteristic use,
1817260	1821580	the intention of the architect, all sorts of mental things.
1821580	1823020	And that's quite correct.
1823020	1827460	Something could look like a house, but not be a house at all.
1827460	1830580	It's used to store books, it's a library.
1830580	1834980	It's used to put courses in, it's a stable.
1834980	1838500	Could be a paperweight for a giant.
1838500	1840580	What it actually is, you can't tell,
1840580	1842740	but it's physical character.
1842740	1846140	I think all the terms that are used for us
1846140	1850020	when we talk about the world have that character.
1850020	1855500	What the thing is, is largely a mental construction.
1855500	1860340	And that brings us back to why the Gleitmann's crucial work.
1860340	1864900	All of these concepts must be basically innate,
1864900	1868420	or at least they're the elements that constitute them
1868420	1871940	must be innate, because a child acquires them
1871940	1874500	on virtually no evidence.
1874500	1878100	Actually, one of Leila's favorite examples
1878100	1884300	was a young child very early, says things like,
1884300	1885940	that's not fair.
1885940	1888500	Try to analyze that.
1888500	1891180	John Rawls has a huge book on it,
1891180	1893700	the Foundation of Modern Political Science,
1893700	1895620	just as his fairness.
1895620	1900260	The concept fair is extremely complex to describe,
1900260	1903380	but a young child has no trouble noticing
1903380	1906740	that things aren't fair.
1906740	1908660	Same with lots of other things.
1908660	1912260	When people talk about the history of modern computer
1912260	1916460	science, programming languages, compiler construction,
1916500	1921380	or automata theory, many give your linguistic work credit
1921380	1926380	for the conceptual ideas behind those concepts.
1926380	1929500	What is it about your work in linguistics
1929500	1936740	that has enabled programming to be as accurate as it is?
1936740	1937860	I wouldn't.
1937860	1940580	That's much too strong.
1940580	1944420	I did work on finite automata theory, which
1944460	1949660	had certain relationships to early programming languages.
1949660	1953020	And there were neutral investigations,
1953020	1956580	cooperative investigations, looking at these contexts.
1956580	1962860	But it's basically forms of formal languages,
1962860	1967220	properties somewhat similar to natural languages.
1967220	1972500	I worked on them in the early 50s around the period
1972500	1975500	that programming languages were being developed,
1975500	1979380	and the two interact in a number of ways.
1979380	1983380	So if you look at a textbook on programming,
1983380	1986940	you'll find things about, sometimes called
1986940	1990940	the Chomsky hierarchy, the hierarchy of possible formal
1990940	1996900	languages, which have various analogs in programming theory.
1996900	2000540	They capture some features of natural language,
2000540	2006580	but they also correspond to certain types of automata,
2006580	2010420	linear bounded automata, push down storage automata,
2010420	2015260	standard interrelate with formal systems that
2015260	2018100	capture some of the properties of language, which
2018100	2020020	is a topic of some interest.
2020020	2025460	But it didn't enable programming.
2025460	2030380	I want to mention some theories of incognitive science
2030380	2033500	and philosophy that you have attacked.
2033500	2036620	I don't know of a softer word to accurately describe it,
2036620	2038980	and want to just get your reflections on it.
2038980	2043020	After many decades of looking back,
2043020	2045820	first is behaviorism.
2045820	2050580	What was it about behaviorism that you found erroneous,
2050580	2055460	and how do you reflect now looking back over the decades?
2055460	2059500	In my view, behaviorism was a radical departure
2059500	2060900	from the sciences.
2060900	2063260	First of all, behaviorism varied.
2063260	2067180	But the form of behaviorism that was pretty much
2067180	2070620	dominant in the period of creation
2070620	2073900	of modern cognitive science was largely
2073900	2076220	skinnerian behaviorism.
2076220	2080100	It was picked up by Van Quine, one
2080100	2083260	of the most influential philosophers of language.
2084020	2089620	Work like Word and Object based very explicitly
2089620	2093620	on operant conditioning, skinnerian behaviorism.
2093620	2097220	And that was all the rage in Cambridge in the 1950s.
2097220	2099860	It was virtual dogma.
2099860	2102100	Skinners, William James Lectures,
2102100	2104540	came out in the late 40s.
2104540	2106460	The book itself, Herbal Behavior,
2106460	2108340	came out about a decade later.
2108340	2111340	But it was whatever it was doing.
2111380	2115020	Well, there were various chips in the armor
2115020	2116620	that began to develop.
2116620	2119980	Some of them were within psychology itself.
2119980	2122540	So George Miller, one of the founders
2122540	2126260	of cognitive psychology, a close friend,
2126260	2128060	worked closely with him for many years.
2128060	2129980	We published together.
2129980	2135460	Even before this started, he did some crucial experiments
2135460	2138100	which raised serious questions.
2138140	2139900	So for example, take the sentence,
2139900	2145300	and John went to the store from any sentence.
2145300	2148180	The standard theory of perception of speech
2148180	2153260	was you have a certain guess about the first word,
2153260	2155660	then you have a guess about the second word,
2155660	2158460	the probability that you're right both times decreases,
2158460	2160300	of course.
2160300	2162660	By the time you get to the last word,
2162660	2165980	it should be very hard to understand in a long sentence.
2165980	2168820	Well, George showed that it's the opposite.
2168820	2171060	You don't understand the early words
2171060	2173620	until you get to the last word, which
2173620	2176900	means that you're forming the thought in your mind.
2176900	2178820	And the thought in your mind is telling you
2178820	2181180	what those early noises were.
2181180	2183700	By now, there's lots of work on this.
2183700	2187180	Well, that just didn't fit at all with behaviorism.
2187180	2190740	There was very important work in neuroscience
2190740	2196660	by Carl Lashley, his work on serial behavior around 1950.
2196660	2199500	It just totally undercut behaviorism,
2199500	2202820	showed that there are overall patterns in behavior
2202820	2204580	that simply just don't work anything
2204580	2207180	like the waivers' models.
2207180	2210020	Nobody looked at that.
2210020	2214540	I found it in the early 50s because it was brought to my
2214540	2219260	attention by an art historian, Harsh Piro,
2220060	2222020	you might be interested in this.
2222020	2225620	Looked at it, so totally wiped out behaviorism.
2225620	2230260	There was other work going on in European, what's
2230260	2234500	called ethology, comparative biology,
2234500	2238860	the Lawrence, Timberg, and others,
2238860	2243700	which was foreign to the environment in which cognitive
2243700	2246180	science grew up.
2246180	2249460	But the main thing was the work on language
2249460	2253740	that I and others started doing in the early 50s
2253740	2259100	was completely inconsistent with all behaviorist assumptions.
2259100	2263860	And there was just no connection between them.
2263860	2265780	You couldn't relate them.
2265780	2271180	And then when Skinner's book appeared,
2271180	2273220	you could read through it, and you
2273220	2276980	could see that it's all hand-waving.
2276980	2279060	There's nothing there.
2279060	2281460	Incidentally, around that time, even
2281460	2285380	within the behaviorist framework,
2285380	2287820	there were cracks developing.
2287820	2291100	So there was work by some of Skinner's students,
2291100	2293660	incidentally important work, which
2293660	2296420	showed that animals just didn't behave
2296420	2298980	by these pattern paradigms.
2298980	2300900	That they seemed to be working only
2300900	2305940	if you picked experimental conditions that essentially
2305940	2308980	adapted instinctive behavior.
2308980	2313140	So you can teach a pigeon to play ping-pong
2313140	2316420	because pigeons peck.
2316420	2319140	So you can modify the pecking behavior.
2319140	2322780	But basically, it was all falling apart from many points
2322780	2323980	of view.
2323980	2328220	And my own view, as it was a bad mistake from the first place,
2328220	2331860	you don't study any subject by saying,
2331860	2335180	let's keep to the superficial manifestations
2335180	2338060	and not look at what's going on internally.
2338060	2339420	You want to understand it?
2339420	2342140	You're going to have to look at what's going on internally.
2342140	2343740	You don't see it.
2343740	2346260	You can't do experiments right on it.
2346260	2349220	You have to study it in indirect ways,
2349220	2351980	the way physics, chemistry, biology,
2351980	2353980	every other subject developed.
2353980	2358260	Linguistic relativity, the so-called Worf hypothesis,
2358260	2361900	where language determines thought in the strong version
2361900	2364620	or at least influences thought in the weak version,
2364620	2367540	that the structure of a language affects the speaker's
2367540	2369340	worldview or cognition.
2369340	2372660	And therefore, when people have different languages,
2372660	2377380	their perceptions are related to the languages they speak,
2377380	2383220	as opposed to a broad human capability.
2383300	2387860	That hypothesis, the superior Worf hypothesis,
2387860	2392500	has been around for 80 or so years.
2392500	2395220	Investigation of its series of investigation
2395220	2397540	began in the early 50s.
2397540	2402180	First person to study it was Eric Leneberg.
2402180	2405020	We were grad students together, personal friend.
2405020	2407860	He went on to found biology of language.
2407860	2410220	But his first work was actually as a student
2410220	2415500	on the Worf hypothesis, experimental work.
2415500	2416780	Couldn't find anything.
2416780	2419740	Everything you tried, you got some superficial results,
2419740	2420980	but nothing.
2420980	2424260	Well, it's now 75 years later.
2424260	2426700	There isn't a lot more to say.
2426700	2430140	There's some evidence.
2430140	2434500	Some of the Lila Gleitman, who I mentioned before,
2434500	2439020	carefully analyzed and did experimental work
2439020	2443540	on some of the alleged evidence that fell apart.
2443540	2447180	There's a few things around that seem possible,
2447180	2451540	but pickings are very slim.
2451540	2454220	I mean, there's some respects in which it's obviously true.
2454220	2460340	So as Leneberg pointed out, 75 you found, 75 years ago,
2460340	2468420	if you study a language that we have a distinction between red
2468420	2472180	and orange and pink, say, but their languages don't.
2472180	2474220	They haven't been studying Hopi.
2474220	2477100	Just use the same word for that spectrum.
2477100	2480220	So he found perfectly predictably
2480220	2484820	that if you use, say, memory texts, tests,
2484820	2485820	did you ever see that?
2485820	2490540	Did you see this shade of color a minute ago?
2490540	2494100	You'll do better if you have names.
2494100	2497260	So in a way, the language affects perception,
2497260	2501380	but in such a trivial way that it's of no interest.
2501380	2503900	And there isn't much more than that.
2503900	2509380	Logical positivism, which was the rage in the early 20th century
2509380	2512780	that said that really there are only two kinds of truths
2512780	2517900	and even only two kinds of intellectual activities
2517900	2520580	worth pursuing, those that are empirical
2520580	2522860	with a scientific method and those that are purely
2522860	2524660	logical with a deduction.
2524700	2528620	Everything else is basically non-stets.
2528620	2531740	Well, logical positivism was an important movement
2531740	2536620	in the 20s, early 30s.
2536620	2541940	By the late 30s, its major figures
2541940	2545100	were drifting away from it.
2545100	2552420	Karnap, Temple, others, Quine, just moving away from it.
2552460	2557900	And it became influential in linguistics and psychology
2557900	2563220	after it was declining philosophy and declining
2563220	2564140	for good reasons.
2564140	2566580	There were internal critiques.
2566580	2569820	But it did have a big influence on linguistics
2569820	2576100	through Leonard Bloomfield, who saw himself as a strict.
2576100	2579340	He was the major linguist in the early 20th century.
2579340	2582420	He did very good work in many areas.
2582420	2585940	But in this area, he was very much misled
2585940	2590940	by picking up an early form of logical positivism, which
2590940	2592660	was not viable.
2592660	2597220	But so I think it's an important, made important contributions,
2597220	2602100	important residue, developed sense in other directions.
2602100	2607980	So if you look at Quine, Copper, Karnap, major figures,
2608580	2612940	Wittgenstein was totally rejected.
2612940	2619700	Then it just is no longer a coherent viable movement.
2619700	2622660	What is your view of contemporary field
2622660	2627380	or subfield of philosophy of language, which subsumes
2627380	2630180	a great deal of what we're talking about and even more
2630180	2630820	than that?
2630820	2631980	What are the categories?
2631980	2633540	What are your reflections on it?
2633540	2637140	Well, I've been a pretty short critic of it.
2637140	2638820	I've been book after book.
2638820	2640940	I don't want to go through that.
2640940	2643460	I mean, there is important work.
2643460	2647460	But a lot of it, I think, is seriously misguided.
2647460	2651180	I could go into details if written about it.
2651180	2653220	So for example, take, say, Quine,
2653220	2656140	who was the Quine and Wittgenstein
2656140	2661100	to the leading figures of modern philosophy of language.
2661100	2664900	Both of them accepted for Quine, who
2664900	2666900	was a strict Schenarian.
2666900	2672180	Language, in his words, is a complex of dispositions
2672180	2676900	to respond to present stimuli.
2676900	2679060	There's nothing to do with language.
2679060	2681620	I mean, it didn't develop that way.
2681620	2683740	It's not used that way.
2683740	2685580	Wittgenstein, the late Wittgenstein,
2685580	2688980	who was interested in language, it was kind of aphoristic.
2688980	2693620	You know, try to give an organized system.
2693620	2698020	But if you look at his comments on acquisition of language,
2698020	2701540	they're strict behaviorist.
2701540	2705140	You know, his language games, somebody
2705140	2710780	is showing a rock and somebody says rock and imitated.
2710780	2712780	That's how you learned rock.
2712780	2714780	Nothing like that happens.
2714780	2717820	I mean, there's tons of experimental evidence by now,
2717820	2720580	even just observational evidence.
2720580	2725940	And I think while there are doubtless major contributions,
2725940	2727780	some of them, a lot of the work, I think,
2727780	2729780	is off on the wrong track.
2729780	2734020	So the main contributions, I think, have been in semantics.
2734020	2737580	Donald Davidson's work on event semantics
2737580	2740500	has turned out to be very productive and influential.
2740500	2746220	It was picked up by Languist philosophers, James Higginbotham,
2746220	2750660	Paul Trotsky, others, and it's turned into, my view,
2750660	2752980	one of the most promising approaches
2752980	2755940	to the general semantics of language.
2755940	2757300	It's called philosophy.
2757300	2759740	I don't know why it's called philosophy.
2759740	2763060	It's basically a good, serious study
2763060	2765580	of the semantics of natural language.
2765580	2768660	Analytics philosophy versus continental philosophy.
2768660	2771180	You're classified as an analytic philosopher.
2771180	2774580	You've had some engagements with continental philosophers
2774580	2775580	famously.
2775580	2779540	What is your reflection on the dichotomy
2779540	2781460	between them, the artificial?
2784820	2787340	How do you see going forward?
2787340	2789420	Well, actually, a good deal of my work
2789420	2795020	is on continental philosophy from the 17th through the 19th
2795020	2809500	century, Descartes, Hume, Locke, onto the philosophers
2809500	2813980	of Humboldt on through the 19th century.
2813980	2819500	Contemporary continental philosophy is quite different.
2819500	2823420	There's work that I find interesting,
2823420	2826220	close to a number of others.
2826220	2831780	But most of the modern work, either I don't understand it
2831780	2835700	or I don't find it very interesting.
2835700	2839180	My own background is in what's called analytic philosophy,
2839180	2841900	though I was, as I've just mentioned,
2841900	2845740	I've been rather critical of a lot of the ways it's developed.
2845740	2851540	But I think basically on the way to finding
2851540	2855420	serious understanding of the way the mind works,
2855420	2856980	the way the world works.
2856980	2858980	What I'd like to do now, Nome, and I've really
2858980	2863020	been looking forward to this, is to get your quick sense
2863020	2865500	of some of the big questions that we
2865500	2868580	ask on Close to the Truth, the themes that
2868580	2874580	are the core of our work over two decades now.
2874580	2879300	And we've asked these questions to all leading
2879300	2883260	scientists, mainly physicists, philosophers,
2883260	2885500	neuroscientists, et cetera, and just
2885500	2887140	want to get your sense.
2887140	2890580	So we'll start with philosophy of mind,
2890580	2892300	which is a very broad category.
2892300	2893900	But from your point of view, what
2893900	2896740	have been the major issues or the problems
2896740	2899540	in philosophy of mind, and where have you
2899540	2902380	staked your own personal claims?
2902420	2905500	I don't know how to distinguish philosophy of mind
2905500	2907820	from science of mind.
2907820	2912940	The science and philosophy were pretty much
2912940	2916860	the same field until the 19th century.
2916860	2921340	Then the names diverged, but not in a serious way.
2921340	2927900	So the most serious work in cognitive science, in my view,
2927900	2931980	is a development of a suggestion by clock John
2931980	2937100	Locke in the wake of Isaac Newton's discoveries, who
2937100	2940780	showed that the mechanical conception
2940780	2944140	of the nature of the world that was developed in modern science
2944140	2945540	just didn't work.
2945540	2950940	So Locke concluded, he phrased it in his theological framework.
2950940	2952260	I'll drop that.
2952260	2957700	But just as the material world has properties
2957740	2960860	that we cannot comprehend, but that
2960860	2966340	are there like interaction without contact.
2966340	2972100	So the mind might just be, let me take it in his theological
2972100	2976620	framework, because it sounds better, just as God provided
2976620	2980780	matter with properties that we cannot understand,
2980780	2983460	like interaction without contact.
2983460	2987620	So God might have super-added to matter
2987620	2991140	the certain forms of matter the property of thought,
2991140	2995780	meaning thought is a property of some organized form of matter,
2995780	2998580	whatever matter turns out to be.
2998580	3000940	That's a fundamental insight.
3000940	3005140	And it was developed carefully through the 19th, 18th century
3005140	3006340	by major figures.
3006340	3010980	It culminated in Joseph Priestley's work.
3010980	3013260	Famous chemist, philosopher, distinction
3013260	3015660	wasn't made in those days.
3015660	3018140	Then it was pretty much forgotten.
3018140	3021700	It was rediscovered in the latter decades
3021700	3023660	of the 20th century.
3023660	3028780	It was then considered a radical new idea in philosophy,
3028780	3033580	astonishing hypothesis, new thesis in biology.
3033580	3037500	Actually Locke's suggestion on the work that was done on it.
3037540	3041260	So that's a core part of philosophy of mine, I think,
3041260	3048140	finding out what it is in the structure of the world,
3048140	3049980	whatever the world is constituted of,
3049980	3052220	that has this property of thought.
3052220	3055220	Well, that's the kind of thing we were talking about before.
3055220	3057540	And there are many mysteries there.
3057540	3060340	One of them, by mystery, I mean things
3060340	3064340	in which there's been no progress for millennia.
3064340	3066100	One question is what we were talking
3066100	3069420	about, the nature of concepts, where to come from,
3069420	3071260	how to people acquire it.
3071260	3076140	Another one is simply what was crucial for Descartes,
3076140	3079780	the fact that our ordinary use of language
3079780	3082420	is constantly innovative.
3082420	3086460	New things that were never said before, they're not random.
3086460	3091660	They're appropriate to situations, not caused by situations.
3091660	3095220	I've called it the creative aspect of language use,
3095260	3098660	total mystery, nobody knows where that comes from.
3098660	3101380	Actually nobody knows anything about voluntary action,
3101380	3103900	but this is a complex case of it.
3103900	3107220	So that's another major problem.
3107220	3109900	There are other problems about, you can go on,
3109900	3113020	problems about what constitutes thought,
3113020	3116500	what the animals do, how is human thought different
3116500	3120060	from the cognition of other organisms.
3120060	3123300	These are mixtures of philosophy and science,
3123300	3127060	which I don't think divide very clearly.
3127060	3130980	Philosophers are studying some of the more general aspects
3130980	3133100	of what the science is doing.
3134700	3137820	And plenty of people just cross the boundaries.
3137820	3139260	Don't pay any attention.
3139260	3142900	Are you committed to a purely materialistic,
3142900	3147900	physicalism approach to anything having to do with the mind?
3149020	3150260	Another way to put it is,
3150260	3153780	what is the ontological status of the mental?
3153780	3155460	To be contrary, and again,
3155460	3159020	I've always taken exactly the opposite position.
3159980	3163740	In my, as I've argued at some length,
3163740	3167780	there was a concept of matter
3167780	3171220	in the early scientific revolution.
3171220	3173220	It's called the mechanical philosophy.
3174380	3176740	The world is a complex machine,
3177740	3180140	a much more complex and intricate version
3180140	3184100	of what skilled artisans were developing
3184100	3186580	all around Europe at the time.
3186580	3190340	The world is just a far more complex variant of that.
3190340	3194700	That was held right through the major part
3194700	3197020	of early modern science.
3197020	3201860	Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Leibniz, Huygens,
3201860	3204860	all the great scientists assumed this.
3204900	3206380	Newton disproved it.
3207340	3211140	He showed that the world is not a machine in a sense.
3211140	3212380	He didn't believe it.
3212380	3214180	He thought it was the most so absurd
3214180	3217380	that nobody with any scientific understanding
3217380	3219540	could possibly believe this.
3219540	3222580	And that's why he called his major book,
3222580	3226500	mathematical principles, not physical principles.
3226500	3229020	He said, I don't have a physical theory.
3229020	3233340	All I have is mathematical principles that seem to work.
3233340	3236940	He was sharply condemned for by Leibniz
3236940	3238500	for the great figures.
3238500	3242580	Well, at that point, the concept of matter disappeared.
3243460	3246380	Matter is just whatever we postulate
3246380	3248020	in our best theories of the world.
3249020	3250500	There's no bounds.
3250500	3253740	If it turns out to be massless particles,
3253740	3256460	okay, it's massless particles.
3256460	3259260	Turns out to, whatever it turns out to be,
3259260	3260700	that's what it is.
3260740	3263260	But there's no fixed notion
3263260	3266260	of the material or the physical.
3266260	3269580	Some philosophers try to hang on to it.
3269580	3273740	Say, well, maybe the physical is spatio-temporal.
3274580	3276500	Now we're back to Locke's suggestion.
3278580	3282180	My thinking does not take place in my feet.
3282180	3285420	It doesn't take place in a tree outside.
3285420	3287620	It takes place up here.
3287620	3291700	So it's spatio-temporally contained.
3291700	3294900	So therefore, all of mine is physical.
3296100	3298820	Since the word essentially has no meaning,
3298820	3302460	just whatever our best theories say,
3302460	3304300	you can say that if you want.
3304300	3307340	But I think the question's just disappeared.
3307340	3310900	There is no coherent notion of materialism
3310900	3312700	as far as I can see.
3312700	3315700	It's just whatever the science has come up with
3315700	3319540	as their best explanations, that's materialism.
3319540	3323380	The trend in philosophy of mine in the last decades
3323380	3327900	has been moving away from what is classically called
3327900	3332900	materialism, that everything mental can be reduced
3333220	3335380	in some way in some future science,
3335380	3337300	maybe not for a thousand years,
3337300	3340940	to physical processes in the brain,
3340940	3343580	whether it's at the neuronal level
3343620	3345540	or the internal neuronal level
3345540	3347260	or the quantum physical level,
3347260	3349420	but still physical within the brain.
3349420	3353780	And so many philosophers today are moving away from that
3353780	3357900	and say that we'll never be able to explain the qualia,
3357900	3361140	the inner experience that we all have,
3361140	3363220	and that you need to go beyond
3363220	3365300	what is traditionally called physicalism,
3365300	3367460	whether it's panpsychism,
3367460	3371180	where everything has a little bit of mental capacity
3371220	3372820	or some kind of dualism
3372820	3375860	where there's a non-physical reality interacting,
3375860	3379140	but there has been a trend in that direction
3379140	3382420	that purely physical explanation of the brain
3382420	3385740	will never fully explain the mental.
3386780	3388860	Well, the problem with that is
3388860	3390600	there is no notion of physical.
3391820	3393860	Actually, this was put very well
3393860	3397780	by fine psychologist, Gell and Strossen,
3397780	3400660	who does commit a depend psychism.
3401220	3403700	But he was talking about consciousness.
3403700	3405620	He said, there's no problem about consciousness.
3405620	3407820	We all know exactly what it is.
3407820	3410940	Consciousness is what I'm experiencing now.
3410940	3413660	The problem is with the physical.
3413660	3416940	When you talk about reducing consciousness to physical,
3416940	3419100	you don't know what physical is.
3419100	3422420	Physical is just whatever the sciences say.
3422420	3425420	So consciousness is gonna be part of it.
3425420	3428300	Actually, it goes back to Russell pretty much.
3428300	3429980	And I think that's correct.
3429980	3431860	There is no physicalism.
3431860	3435860	So whatever's going on in my mind
3435860	3438500	and your mind is in your brains.
3438500	3440740	It's not going on somewhere else.
3440740	3442580	Well, the brains are,
3442580	3444460	if the brain isn't a physical object,
3444460	3446140	I don't know what is.
3446140	3449700	So therefore, it's going on in your brain.
3449700	3453060	It's some sort of process going on in there,
3453060	3454220	not anywhere else.
3455580	3457780	The rest is just idle talk.
3457780	3460780	But Galen Strausson, who's a very good example
3460780	3463100	and people can see his videos on Closer to Truth.
3463100	3464900	He's a good friend.
3464900	3469740	He would say that you need to have some deeper understanding
3469740	3474740	of the nature of all physical properties
3475020	3478380	in order to understand how the brain can generate
3478380	3481780	in some way, the concept of consciousness.
3481780	3483940	You put in the word physical.
3483940	3488060	You have to, as I understand his views,
3488060	3489700	which I think I agree with,
3489700	3493780	you have to have an understanding of the nature of the world
3493780	3497700	in order to find how the mind functions.
3497700	3500900	Because the mind is just part of the world
3500900	3505620	as Locke famously should be famously,
3505620	3507660	unfortunately he's forgotten.
3507660	3509820	But as he pointed out,
3509820	3511820	there's no reason not to regard
3511820	3515580	thinking as a property of organized matter.
3515580	3518180	Whatever matter turns out to be,
3518180	3520140	we don't know what's gonna turn out to be.
3520140	3522260	Sure, I think that is an approach
3522260	3524860	that there's an expanded understanding
3524860	3527500	of what reality is that we call matter and something else.
3527500	3531380	But whatever it is, that's the total reality of the world.
3531380	3532300	And there may be things
3532300	3535140	that we totally don't understand that now,
3535140	3537700	whether it's panpsychism or something else.
3537700	3540460	I don't go along with Strausson
3540460	3543860	as far as he does to the panpsychism.
3543860	3548860	That is argument for panpsychism is based on a serious point.
3550220	3553100	Can there be what he calls radically emergence?
3554540	3558140	Tirely new properties somehow developing
3558140	3563140	without any elements of them in earlier structures.
3563420	3565340	I think that happens all the time.
3566300	3570620	There's nothing in the hydrogen atom,
3570620	3572340	which says you're a liquid.
3572340	3577340	Changes take place with levels of complexity increasing
3578740	3581140	that bring about entirely new phenomena.
3582060	3584380	So I don't, that's a strong argument.
3584380	3587780	The critical mass of an atomic bomb is a good example
3587780	3589580	where you have uranium-235,
3589580	3591860	a certain purity of it,
3591860	3594580	and it'll be inert, it'll be radioactive,
3594580	3597660	but you add one more microgram
3597660	3599260	and then you have an atomic bomb
3599260	3600780	because it hits that critical mass.
3600780	3602460	It's a simple analogy, but...
3604700	3607260	It's just that everything in nature is like that.
3607260	3611380	Back to eukaryotic cells, which I meant, or water.
3612540	3615180	The properties of water aren't detectable
3615180	3616740	in hydrogen and oxygen.
3616740	3618020	But this is a critical point,
3618020	3619340	and I'm gonna push it a little bit further,
3619340	3621540	because with hydrogen and oxygen,
3621540	3623780	we can understand how,
3623780	3627660	when you understand the science of bonding and flow
3627660	3630460	and molecules slipping by one another,
3630460	3632700	that with advanced science,
3632700	3637700	you can, in fact, predict or reverse engineer
3638620	3640100	from when you know the structure
3640100	3643300	to why that becomes liquid.
3643300	3644540	Now, the question is,
3644540	3648460	is everything about the mind of that same character
3648460	3650580	where eventually science,
3650580	3654300	given as much time as you want, 10,000 years,
3654300	3655740	be able to access it?
3655740	3658420	Or are there aspects of the mental
3658420	3662580	that are forever beyond the purview of science?
3662580	3665700	No more than aspects of motion.
3665700	3668500	Go back to Newton and Leibniz.
3668500	3671860	They had no problem understanding
3671860	3674300	Newton's theories of gravity.
3675060	3677380	Okay, it was what they described
3677380	3679820	that was unintelligible.
3679820	3682940	We cannot conceive, as Locke said,
3682940	3686580	we cannot conceive of objects interacting
3687460	3689140	in a mechanical fashion.
3690140	3692100	And we can't, it's a fact.
3692100	3695300	Science just gave up the task of trying to.
3696260	3699620	Galileo through Newton and Leibniz,
3699620	3702540	science was trying to develop a picture
3702540	3707100	of an intelligible world that was given up.
3707100	3709180	We don't try to do that anymore.
3709180	3713780	We try to find intelligible theories of the world,
3713780	3715620	like Newton's theory,
3715620	3720620	or the theory of how hydrogen and oxygen molecules
3721820	3724740	yield water, but it's not intelligible.
3724740	3728560	We can't, we have no grasp of what's going on.
3728560	3730740	We understand the theory, we can follow it,
3730740	3732520	as you say, we predicted.
3732520	3736860	That's now the goal of science for hundreds of years,
3736860	3739420	since basically since Newton,
3739420	3742100	which abandoned the Galilean hope
3742100	3746900	of developing an intelligible world.
3746900	3750180	So can you do that for the mind?
3752700	3754140	No reason why.
3754140	3756340	Maybe we can't, maybe we don't have
3756340	3759300	the intellectual capacity to do it,
3759300	3762060	but that doesn't mean there's no explanation for it.
3763060	3767580	I mean, we're not angels, we're organisms.
3767580	3772580	Our mental capacities have certain scope, certain limits,
3773780	3777260	but no reason to believe that we can understand everything.
3777260	3779100	So in the philosophy of science,
3779100	3782540	would you classify yourself as an anti-realist
3782540	3787540	in the sense that we have access to empirical information,
3787820	3790620	we can sense regularities,
3790620	3794620	but there's really no hope of understanding reality
3794620	3797140	as it is quite reality in itself.
3797140	3798100	No, I don't.
3798100	3800340	We can understand it to the extent
3800340	3802980	that humans are capable of understanding things.
3804260	3807300	We are, I don't know about you,
3807300	3811780	but I have no grasp of,
3811780	3815940	I can follow the theory that explains how hydrogen
3816740	3820460	oxygen end up feeling like a liquid,
3820460	3822220	but I don't have any grasp of it.
3822220	3825060	I can follow the theory, okay?
3825060	3827100	And that's the way science works.
3828100	3832740	I have no grasp of it, field of force, let's say.
3832740	3837020	I understand it can work with vector spaces and so on,
3837020	3841540	but that doesn't give me what Tom Nagel
3841540	3843580	calls a feeling of what it is.
3844580	3847620	We don't have a feeling of that about anything,
3849420	3853780	but we can do the best we can to try to find theories
3853780	3857660	that explain the properties that we discovered.
3857660	3861580	Now we can understand the theories, maybe get better ones.
3861580	3865100	Can we get good enough ones to explain,
3865100	3867820	say, elements of consciousness?
3867820	3869340	You never know.
3869340	3872860	You can, you know, as you learn and study more,
3872980	3876180	you find more, then you find more problems.
3876180	3878980	Not science, you know, it's like hill climbing.
3878980	3882060	You climb a hill, you think you've gotten somewhere,
3882060	3884660	you look up and there's a big hill.
3884660	3886940	It's all the whole history of science.
3886940	3889060	No, one of the questions we'd love to ask
3889060	3892940	on Close to the Truth is a two-word question,
3892940	3896340	two-word sentence, what exists?
3896340	3900940	And by that, what we mean are what are the minimum number
3900940	3904460	of non-reducible categories that you need
3904460	3907740	to explain all of reality?
3907740	3912740	Science has its own answers, partial answers.
3912860	3916660	So they might say elementary particles.
3917780	3922420	Then you pick up a quantum theory journal
3922420	3926380	and you find a symposium of great scientists
3926380	3928260	about what is a particle?
3929260	3930780	All kind of views.
3932020	3934700	Basically, we know some things about it,
3934700	3937660	but we really don't know what a particle is.
3937660	3939700	Okay, so you go on to the next step.
3942060	3945100	I don't think these are questions that can have answers.
3945100	3946980	They have answers, but only answers
3946980	3950660	that you move towards as you learn more.
3950660	3953140	How far you'll go is never anyway to know.
3954020	3957980	Along the way, you cast aside problems
3958100	3961340	as ones we can't deal with,
3961340	3966340	the way science afternoon cast aside the problem of motion.
3967380	3969780	You go back to the 17th century,
3969780	3972700	they had a concept of hard problem.
3972700	3975100	Today, the fashion is to say
3975100	3978020	that the hard problem is consciousness.
3978020	3982340	17th century, what they called the hard problem was motion.
3983580	3986700	Problem was never solved, it was abandoned.
3986700	3988740	And then the last question,
3988740	3991660	which in one sense is the very first question
3991660	3992860	that we'd love to ask is,
3992860	3995860	why is there something rather than nothing?
3995860	3998180	Why is there anything at all?
3998180	4000180	And the question I want to ask you,
4000180	4002660	is that a legitimate question to ask?
4002660	4004980	Because we ask it, but one of the claims
4004980	4007380	is that that's not a question
4007380	4010020	that you should be able to ask.
4011100	4013540	Well, the best answer to that that I heard
4013540	4017820	was by a great philosopher, personal friend,
4017820	4019500	you know, Sidney Morgan Besser.
4020940	4023380	Sid was asked that once, and he said,
4023380	4026700	look, if there was nothing, you'd be fetching about that.
4028780	4031220	Covetching in terms of our common answers,
4031220	4032300	this means complaining.
4033820	4035580	I learned that from my grandmother.
4037020	4038820	No, and this has been an absolute delight.
4038820	4040340	I wish we could go on forever.
4040340	4042380	You have made such contributions,
4042380	4043660	not just to linguistics,
4043660	4047700	but to ways of thinking, challenging us in linguistics,
4047700	4050060	certainly in political science,
4050060	4051980	even if some of us may disagree
4051980	4055020	with some of the things that you say in all categories,
4055020	4057700	you've had a tremendous contribution
4057700	4060940	to intellectual thought, to the enjoyment
4060940	4065500	and the appreciation of reality over these seven decades
4065500	4068020	for you, certainly my entire lifetime,
4068020	4071060	on a personal basis, it's great to experience
4071060	4073700	this real interaction with you now.
4073700	4076820	As I said, we met at MIT very briefly, 40 years ago.
4077700	4079460	So it's just a great pleasure for me.
4079460	4082500	And I look forward to another session,
4082500	4084580	70 or so years from now.
4084580	4086620	We'll discuss some of the same things
4086620	4090580	and see how you've progressed over that time.
4090580	4092700	We'll have the same mysteries, I think.
4093700	4095020	All the best, all the best.
