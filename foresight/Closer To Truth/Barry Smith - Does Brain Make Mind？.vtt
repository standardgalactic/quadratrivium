Barry, when we try to understand what our mental state is, what our mind is, we know

00:05.200 --> 00:11.120
the brain does it. But how does it do it? What are the mechanisms by which the brain

00:11.120 --> 00:16.720
gives us what we think is the mind? Well, I think the mechanisms are beginning to show us how much

00:16.720 --> 00:22.560
colouring, shading, structuring and form is going into a single conscious episode. It's

00:22.560 --> 00:27.840
interesting that what happens at any moment in consciousness depends on many things that happen

00:27.840 --> 00:34.000
outside that moment elsewhere, both what's gone on before and how the brain is anticipating what's

00:34.000 --> 00:41.040
coming next, and also your recognition of familiar objects, familiar faces, a familiar smell.

00:41.040 --> 00:46.160
Now, when all of that information is being assembled, our job and the brain's job it seems

00:46.160 --> 00:53.120
is to provide me, to provide my conscious mental state with something recognisable, familiar and

00:53.120 --> 00:58.880
a clue to what's going on in my environment. So we're using internal clues, external clues,

00:58.880 --> 01:03.840
to provide a single experience that gets me around the world and tells me what's going on out there

01:03.840 --> 01:09.200
and with me. So you're relating memory systems that you have, all of your senses together.

01:10.160 --> 01:17.920
How many different modules, if you will, mental modules come in to give this sense of

01:18.880 --> 01:24.960
of normality that we have, which we know comes from a huge number of different kinds of inputs.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.880
A huge number of different kinds of inputs. And I think some of the inputs we don't recognise

01:28.880 --> 01:34.400
is occurring at all. Take the sense of smell, terribly important, but often goes unnoticed.

01:34.400 --> 01:39.680
So we think we're relying on our vision and we're relying on our hearing a lot. But sense of smell

01:39.680 --> 01:45.280
is giving you something like familiarity. Is this my own home? Because when I walk in it will

01:45.280 --> 01:49.920
smell the way it should. Now, I don't notice it because I'm so used to it. But if I lost my sense

01:49.920 --> 01:56.080
of smell, that would make the place I was now familiar with seem eerie, strange, unfamiliar.

01:56.080 --> 02:01.040
So I think we're getting signals all the time from various different senses. We're getting

02:01.040 --> 02:07.200
signals perhaps from different kinds of visual systems, not just what are the recognisable

02:07.200 --> 02:12.320
objects, but how near are they to me? Can I reach for them? So we treat things that are within our

02:12.320 --> 02:17.680
peripersonal space, the kind of sphere of operation of our reach very differently from

02:17.680 --> 02:22.240
things that are outside it. I might have no such attachment to a cup that's over there

02:22.240 --> 02:28.960
as to one that's right by my arm. So huge numbers of very delicate operations are going on all the

02:28.960 --> 02:36.800
time across many ranges of sensory inputs to give a structured and a rich experience that

02:36.880 --> 02:43.440
makes me poised for action, familiar in my environment, and also comfortable with myself.

02:43.440 --> 02:49.520
So we're talking about the senses part of how the brain makes the mind. But there are other

02:49.520 --> 02:58.800
pieces as well, language, for example, or different kinds of memory systems that are emotional,

02:58.800 --> 03:05.120
as opposed to sensorial. So how about some of these big systems that work together? I mean,

03:05.120 --> 03:11.600
sensory is one category and there are many subcategories, but how many of these big categories

03:11.600 --> 03:16.480
are integrating together? Yes, I mean, there's overlay. I mean, we're never without our senses.

03:16.480 --> 03:20.640
The idea that we're having experience with our senses switched off is nonsense. So there's

03:20.640 --> 03:25.040
always sensory information providing a lot of the texture in the background. But of course,

03:25.040 --> 03:31.600
what's going on in consciousness has to be captured and related to other moments in our life. We're

03:31.600 --> 03:37.440
quite often very interested in how we make sense of the here and now by what we previously saw or

03:37.440 --> 03:42.880
experienced. And some of the things that will track across those separate episodes will be memory,

03:43.600 --> 03:49.840
partly episodic memory, have I been here before, but also semantic memory when I'm classifying

03:49.840 --> 03:56.480
things as of a certain kind, recognizably of the same type. It's that kind of car, it's that kind

03:56.480 --> 04:03.360
of bottle and so on. Now, when I'm dealing with the world around me, there's always a level of

04:03.360 --> 04:09.120
appreciation of how I feel about it. So you've got this constant modulation of your state of

04:09.120 --> 04:15.120
consciousness by your emotions. And then on top of that, of course, we want to classify, capture,

04:15.120 --> 04:21.120
and make precise some of the things that would otherwise quickly fade from consciousness. And

04:21.120 --> 04:26.640
I think language is very good at anchoring our experience. It gives us a way of locking on to

04:26.640 --> 04:32.160
and locking down some parts. Also, of course, gives us a way of coordinating our conscious

04:32.160 --> 04:37.200
experience with one another. Because by using certain words, I can put you in mind of I can

04:37.200 --> 04:42.480
actually rearrange your experience to make you think about things that aren't here. If I start

04:42.480 --> 04:46.560
talking about New York or Chicago, we're not there. But of course, somehow your mind can

04:46.560 --> 04:53.200
flip there very easily. Now that magic of words, which allows us to transport the mind outside

04:53.200 --> 04:59.440
the moment of consciousness, is a large part of what gives us extended minds, minds that can

04:59.440 --> 05:05.520
communicate one with another. So one way in which the brain makes the mind is giving us new insights

05:05.520 --> 05:10.000
into why the mind experiences things the way it does. And of course, when we're at the level of

05:10.000 --> 05:15.760
mind, it all seems to be very easy to understand just from reflecting on our own experience.

05:15.760 --> 05:22.240
But new work on the brain is actually casting light on why our experience patterns the way it

05:22.240 --> 05:27.680
does, why it has the form and character it does. Here's some unexpected surprises. So it turns out

05:27.680 --> 05:33.680
there are certain aromas that are often used in shampoo that make your hair feel softer. So it

05:33.680 --> 05:38.320
turns out that smell is having an impact on touch. It's making what you feel at the end of your

05:38.320 --> 05:44.240
fingers change. Similarly, aromas and certain foods can make them taste creamier. So that's an

05:44.320 --> 05:49.280
unexpected way in which that sounds bizarre. It sounds bizarre. And yet this is something we

05:49.280 --> 05:54.720
wouldn't have known unless we were able to drill down into how the brain is actually making and

05:54.720 --> 06:00.480
manufacturing those those touch experiences. Here's another one. When we're eating potato chips,

06:00.480 --> 06:06.160
and we leave them out for a day or two out of the packet, they go stale. They're not very nice to

06:06.160 --> 06:12.240
eat. Stale, of course, is just that they crumble differently in the mouth. But if you put on headphones

06:12.240 --> 06:18.560
and you amplify the high frequency sound of your own crunching, they taste fresh. So again,

06:18.560 --> 06:22.800
who would have thought that sound would have an impact on flavour? So this way in which

06:23.440 --> 06:29.280
single experiences that we think are coming from a very easily recognisable source are actually

06:29.280 --> 06:34.800
concoctions that depend on a collaboration of senses to produce that effect. And so now we're

06:34.800 --> 06:40.480
beginning to understand our experience better by seeing precisely how the brain makes these

06:40.480 --> 06:43.680
moments in mind.
