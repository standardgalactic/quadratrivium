00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
Is life fundamental in the cosmos?

00:29.000 --> 00:39.000
By this I mean, is life an inevitable outcome of the development of our universe baked in from the beginning?

00:39.000 --> 00:50.000
One need not believe in God or in anything supernatural to give credence to the big speculative idea that life in our universe is no accident,

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
that life somehow must emerge from the deep structure of the cosmos.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.000
How to address this big question?

01:01.000 --> 01:11.000
One way is to examine the deep structure of the cosmos and to do so via mathematics, which is the foundation of physics.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
Here's the question that follows.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Is mathematics also the foundation of biology?

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
Can mathematics explain biology?

01:22.000 --> 01:35.000
I'm Robert Lawrence Kuhn and Closer to Truth is my journey to find out.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
How to explore the relationship between mathematics and biology?

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
First, mathematics can describe biology with simplifying models that approximate reality.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
So, how does this work?

01:49.000 --> 01:57.000
Second, can mathematics also constitute the biological mechanisms that are reality?

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
I start with state-of-the-art research.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
I meet a pioneer who develops mathematical models to assess physiological disorders.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
What do these models say about the mathematics of biology?

02:10.000 --> 02:16.000
The author of, from clocks to chaos, the rhythms of life, Leon Glass.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.000
Leon, I'd like to understand how mathematics can help elucidate the rhythms of life.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
So, one of the ways that the mathematics has interacted with the subject matter

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
is to develop mathematical models of the various systems of the body,

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
the various rhythms of the body in nerve cells or in heart cells,

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
the various ionic currents that are going into and out of cells.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
All of these are described experimentally.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
You can measure the velocity of a conduction of a nerve cell.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
You can measure the period of the heart.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
But you can also try to study the underlying mechanisms

02:56.000 --> 03:03.000
and develop equations that one can use to model and to reproduce the behaviors.

03:03.000 --> 03:11.000
So, one of the ways in which this has been important is in terms of making the experiments better.

03:11.000 --> 03:15.000
In our own work, one of the problems that we're very interested in

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
is predicting the risk of sudden cardiac death.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.000
One of the factors that plays a role is instabilities in the heart

03:26.000 --> 03:32.000
that may be observable and may be understood prior to the cardiac arrest.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
It has been documented, mostly in early work,

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
that abnormal beats called premature ventricular complexes

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
have increased the risk for sudden death.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
When we look at electrocardiograms, when we look at records of heartbeats

03:50.000 --> 03:57.000
over people over many hours and people particularly who have these abnormal heartbeats,

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
we see extremely unusual patterns of activity which are almost like fingerprints,

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
we call them heart prints, in which individual people can be distinguished one from the other.

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
Well, we believe that some of these dynamic patterns may be significant

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
in terms of increasing or predicting the increased risk of heart death.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
And what type of mathematics do you use for the analysis?

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
So, most of the analysis at the moment is just statistics.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
If we try to do models, then the models are using either different equations

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
or nonlinear differential equations to try to model the details of those dynamics.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
But we have found it very hard to model the details in individual people.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
This is frustrating because it's the sort of thing that we ought to be able to do.

04:51.000 --> 04:58.000
So, one of the problems in this area is that the real-world events in any person are comparatively rare.

04:58.000 --> 05:06.000
So, it's necessary to develop big databases over long periods of time.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
And I might say that one of the ways mathematics is being used now

05:10.000 --> 05:20.000
is in terms of development of large databases to try to make sense of what's happening in individual patients.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
So, one of the ways in which things will go forward in the future

05:23.000 --> 05:31.000
is developing increasingly personalized models for understanding what's happening in individual people

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
and also predicting what will happen.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
Leon's work exemplifies two kinds or uses of mathematics in biology.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.000
First, statistical analysis of large data sets.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.000
And second, model-making to improve experimental design and enable individual predictivity.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
For example, that cardiac arrhythmias may be dynamical diseases offers new treatment protocols.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
Clearly, math and biology are related.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm not surprised, but it's the scope and kind of relationship that count.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
The more pervasive and powerful math is in explicating biology,

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
the more fundamental math may be in driving biology.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
So, can math also explicate other areas of biology?

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
Take biological reproduction, such as the spread of infectious diseases.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
I meet the scientists who initiated the field of virus dynamics,

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
which led to a quantitative understanding of HIV infection,

06:34.000 --> 06:40.000
professor of biology and mathematics at Harvard, Martin Nowak.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.000
So, mathematics can be used to describe populations of cells and viruses.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
Viruses infect cells and infected cells produce more viruses.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
This is what I call the basic model of virus dynamics.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
And that's a very simple mathematical equation.

06:55.000 --> 07:01.000
And that's an equation you can actually use to really address a very important biomedical problem.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
And that was something that we did in 1995.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
For example, HIV and HIV treatments already became available.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
And you gave a single drug to a patient, and the patient developed resistance within four weeks.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Why was that evolution of resistance so fast?

07:17.000 --> 07:22.000
Some viruses infect cells and then they sit there, they do nothing for a very long time.

07:22.000 --> 07:28.000
So, we were actually able to analyze data at that time using the basic model of virus dynamics.

07:28.000 --> 07:33.000
Data, how the virus abundance in the patient declines in response to treatment.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
So, you have somehow an equilibrium of virus abundance in that patient.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
Then you hit the virus with treatment, and then you observe how the virus responds to that treatment.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
And from that response rate, you can prove, actually, using the basic model of virus dynamics,

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
that generation time of the virus in those patients is approximately one day.

07:53.000 --> 08:01.000
In other words, 99% of the virus particles that you find in the blood of patients came from cells that were infected only yesterday.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Wow, wow.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
And that you can show, mathematically, with the model of virus dynamics, you get this interpretation.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
And then you know that's the turnover rate of the virus.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Then you can calculate its evolutionary potential.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
And then you're not surprised that it gets complete resistance against the single drug in four weeks.

08:18.000 --> 08:23.000
And that was a very strong argument to move the field to combination treatment.

08:23.000 --> 08:31.000
So, when you now hit the virus with three drugs at the same time, chances are that the virus does not come up with resistance

08:31.000 --> 08:36.000
because the resistant mutant to all three drugs is not present in the virus population at the time you start treatment.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
And now I'm arguing the same for cancer treatment.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
In some sense, it is always like this.

08:41.000 --> 08:47.000
You give a treatment, the resistant mutant is already present at the time you start treatment.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
This is how the biological population kind of works.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
The mutants are just sitting there, they're not doing anything.

08:52.000 --> 08:57.000
But once you give treatment, you hit the sensitive cells, but the resistant ones start to grow.

08:57.000 --> 09:04.000
So we proved also for cancer that against single treatment, it is a mathematical necessity

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
that the resistant mutant cells will be present at the time you start treatment.

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
And therefore, you have to use at least two drugs at the same time.

09:12.000 --> 09:19.000
You have to force the cancer to make two mutational steps, each one with a probability of 10 to the minus 9,

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
because that would not be present.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.000
So 10 to the minus 9, if you only have one of them, if you have a large number of cancer cells, it'll happen.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
But 10 to the minus 18th will not happen.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
What kind of equations describe this?

09:37.000 --> 09:44.000
Branching processes, for example, so these are particular stochastic processes in probability theory

09:44.000 --> 09:51.000
where a cell can either die or it can reproduce or it can produce a mutant, and that's what we follow over time.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
And do you have to do simulation runs?

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
We can do computer simulations, but we always want to prove mathematically.

09:58.000 --> 10:06.000
And what are the fundamental implications of this for cancer?

10:06.000 --> 10:15.000
I think that you get a precise quantitative mathematical understanding of how to...

10:15.000 --> 10:22.000
A startling medical breakthrough, the cocktail of drugs to treat HIV and stop AIDS,

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
transforming a death sentence into a chronic condition that can be managed.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.000
And key to developing the treatment is the mathematics of viral dynamics,

10:32.000 --> 10:37.000
biological secrets encoded in the language of mathematics,

10:37.000 --> 10:44.000
more clues to math's deep presence in the foundations of life, more evidence is needed.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
What else in biology can math explain?

10:47.000 --> 10:54.000
Can simple mathematical rules govern diverse biological phenomena?

10:54.000 --> 11:00.000
I go to the Santa Fe Institute, the world leader in complexity research,

11:00.000 --> 11:09.000
much of it based on biology, to meet a pioneer in universal scaling laws, physicist Jeffrey West.

11:09.000 --> 11:18.000
It's mathematics which expresses the underlying generic constraints of networks,

11:18.000 --> 11:26.000
and they are concepts like the idea of space filling, which is that this network has to go everywhere.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
Every cell has to be fed, so you have to put that into a mathematical framework.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
You have to mathematicalize that.

11:31.000 --> 11:39.000
You have to also mathematicalize optimization, the fact that the surgery system that we all share,

11:39.000 --> 11:46.000
we in this instance, meaning every single mammal that has ever existed,

11:46.000 --> 11:54.000
we all share the same fractal-like self-similar network which is optimizing

11:54.000 --> 11:59.000
in terms of the amount of energy that is being dissipated in the system.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
So you have to put that into mathematics, and there are well-known techniques for doing this,

12:04.000 --> 12:11.000
in the guise of field theory and Euler Lagrange equations,

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
which is in a certain sense, mathematicizing life.

12:14.000 --> 12:21.000
And it is from that, putting these concepts into mathematics and solving the equations

12:21.000 --> 12:28.000
that shows, for one thing, that the optimal configuration of the network

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
is that it is like a fractal, that it is self-similar.

12:31.000 --> 12:37.000
It sort of repeats itself with generic rules within the network itself.

12:37.000 --> 12:44.000
So the way growth works in this framework is that, first of all,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
you have to have the idea that you have to supply energy.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
So you eat, you metabolize the energy, and then you have to send it through the networks.

12:51.000 --> 12:55.000
So that's where the mathematics comes in, the constraints of the networks.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
It then gets delivered to the cells, so you have mathematics there.

12:59.000 --> 13:07.000
And at the cellular level, that metabolic energy is allocated between

13:07.000 --> 13:15.000
repair, maintenance, replacing cells that have died and so on, and new growth.

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
And so one has to write down the mathematics of that with the network constraining it.

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
And if you do that, what comes out is something very satisfying,

13:27.000 --> 13:36.000
and that is that you show that the growth curve, that is how the size of the organism changes with time.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
And what you find is something that's called sigmoidal growth.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
You start quickly, and then you stop.

13:43.000 --> 13:52.000
And what is beautiful about the theory is that it explains naturally why you stop growing.

13:52.000 --> 13:59.000
And that stopping of growth is intimately related to the fact that metabolic rate,

13:59.000 --> 14:07.000
the supply of energy is scaling with an exponent which is less than one with an economy of scale,

14:07.000 --> 14:14.000
so that the bigger you are, less energy is being delivered to cells as you grow.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
On the other hand, the number of cells is increasing linearly.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.000
And if you increase linearly, and you're only being supplied with something that's less than linear,

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
eventually you stop.

14:27.000 --> 14:34.000
And that's how you stop. And use that, you can calculate the complete growth curve of any organism.

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
And you can use the same mathematics and come up with approximately the size of the optimization of each organism.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Yes.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
So that's really remarkable.

14:42.000 --> 14:53.000
So it's very lovely. And in fact, even more beautiful, I think, is that the theory then tells you how to rescale the size and age of every organism

14:53.000 --> 14:58.000
so that it appears that every organism is growing at the same rate.

14:58.000 --> 15:03.000
Everything reduces to a single curve on which we all sit.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
So it's the great unity of life.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Here's what's remarkable.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
Mathematical models not only can account for specific biological phenomena,

15:15.000 --> 15:25.000
but can also unify diverse biological phenomena across radically different life forms.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Mathematizing life.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.000
The beauty of mathematics engendering the beauty of biology?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Not quite.

15:33.000 --> 15:40.000
Because everything I've heard so far is about the descriptive power of mathematics and biology.

15:40.000 --> 15:48.000
Can math go further? Can math discern deeper laws generating or regulating life?

15:48.000 --> 15:52.000
I ask a theoretical physicist who's creative, sometimes startling ideas,

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
challenge current belief in biology as well as in physics, Paul Davies.

15:58.000 --> 16:05.000
What I see as being a useful application of mathematics in biology is in reconstructing the tree of life.

16:05.000 --> 16:13.000
And so if you pick a particular one of your genes, chances are it'll be identical in me,

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
but if we look at a chimpanzee, we'll find the same gene, but there'll be a few variations

16:17.000 --> 16:21.000
and a pig, even more variations, a geranium, even more.

16:21.000 --> 16:27.000
And so by looking at the genetic distances, the deviations, how great they are between organisms,

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
you can go back and construct a tree and infer something about the sequence,

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
genetic sequence in the common origin.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
And that's been very useful.

16:36.000 --> 16:43.000
It is a way of approaching the theory of evolution in a more mathematical way.

16:43.000 --> 16:49.000
But it's really a form of curve fitting, I think. It's not a law.

16:49.000 --> 16:55.000
There's no way, for example, that we could predict now, if we came back in another 10 million years,

16:55.000 --> 17:01.000
that some new type of organism, which hadn't existed on Earth before, would have come into existence.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
There's too much contingency.

17:02.000 --> 17:09.000
You've been trying to search for new laws of physics to explain biology.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
If that quest turns out to be fruitful, which is very much uncertain,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
do you see that being described in mathematical terms?

17:16.000 --> 17:23.000
Oh, very definitely. So I have in mind, with the new type of physics that I think operates in living systems,

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
that there will be equations to write down that would describe it.

17:27.000 --> 17:34.000
I have a hunch that it might have something to do with the transition between the quantum world and the classical world.

17:34.000 --> 17:44.000
And so this is, I'm about to make a very heretical statement, that when we talk about evolution in the context of quantum physics,

17:44.000 --> 17:47.000
what we mean then is not biological evolution.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
We mean how does the wave function change over time? How does it evolve?

17:51.000 --> 17:56.000
And there is a particular mathematical way. It's called unitary evolution.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
It's a bit like something being time-symmetric or reversible.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
So long as you don't make a measurement, that's how wave functions evolve.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
If you make a measurement, they evolve in a very different way, sometimes called the collapse of the wave function.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
Some people don't believe it really happens, but that's a different story.

18:13.000 --> 18:22.000
So I think there will be an additional term in the Schrodinger's equation for the evolution of the wave function,

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
representing the type of biology that I'm talking about.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
This will be a term that would be negligible at the level of atoms and small molecules,

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
but would become more and more significant at the level of large molecules.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
And this would be a non-unitary evolution of the wave function.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.000
So this idea of the wave function collapses, I think there will be this additional term

18:45.000 --> 18:50.000
which will bring the classical world into being at about the same transition

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
as to where we would start using biology language, language of signals and information

18:55.000 --> 19:02.000
and translation and transcription and all those sorts of things biologists love,

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
and the realm of atoms and molecules of physicists love.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
You would not be upset if I classified that idea as some place between radical and bizarre?

19:11.000 --> 19:18.000
Yes, I myself would describe this as more than radical, because it is a step, it's a big step,

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
and I've resisted that step for most of my career.

19:21.000 --> 19:30.000
I've somehow thought that in my emergent view of the world that the only real laws of the laws

19:30.000 --> 19:34.000
would take place at the bottom level of physics,

19:34.000 --> 19:41.000
because I think we're never going to resolve this dispute between emergence and reductionism.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
We just go on talking in philosophical terms forever and ever,

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
and as somebody boldly says, look, there are actual genuine physical effects that could be measured

19:50.000 --> 19:54.000
where, to put it very bluntly, that if you're a complete reductionist,

19:54.000 --> 20:01.000
an atom that would have done that does that as a result of these additional effects.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
And you can define that mathematically, you think?

20:03.000 --> 20:08.000
I believe that we can define it mathematically, I have some ideas about how to do it,

20:08.000 --> 20:14.000
but unless you can explore it experimentally, then these are just words.

20:14.000 --> 20:21.000
Paul offers fearless radical science, new physics with new mathematics needed for life,

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
an additional term in the Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
needed for evolving the wave form in biology, yikes!

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
As most scientists, Paul's conjecture will not score well.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.000
Ask me, well, I'm intrigued.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
I'd follow Paul along this trail, take a chance.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
I might like or hope there is something special about biology,

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
not reducible to standard model physics.

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
But what I might like or hope should not determine what I should think.

20:56.000 --> 21:03.000
I now look to the future, wonder what's in store for the mathematics of biology.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
I seek a visionary with depth in mathematics and breadth in biology.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
I go to the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton to meet its director, at the time,

21:13.000 --> 21:17.000
theoretical physicist Robert Dycraft.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
I think in terms of the mathematics in biology, we're still waiting for the big breakthrough.

21:22.000 --> 21:27.000
I think physics, before Newton and others, it was also struggling.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
In fact, Newton had to think of the concept of a derivative,

21:31.000 --> 21:35.000
an infinitesimal change, very strange concept,

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
and had to invent calculus as the natural language for physics,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
and then it turned out to be very successful.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
We have seen other things in quantum mechanics.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
We had to think of abstract algebra and non-commutative objects

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
or Einstein's in terms of curved spaces.

21:51.000 --> 21:56.000
If you see time and time and again when science meets a new field,

21:56.000 --> 22:01.000
a field of great complexity with lots of data and structures,

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
then ideally new mathematical concepts emerge.

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
So I think the life sciences will be a great gift to mathematics

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
because it's a completely different world.

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
It has a different language. What we are looking for are new ideas,

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
and I think actually that in some sense the deep ideas from computer science,

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
the way you think in terms of algorithms,

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
where you have instructions that reproduce itself,

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
that's an element that's much closer to the nature of life.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.000
I think we see time and time again our examples where you have massive data sets

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
and inside these huge spaces of hundreds of millions of dimensions,

22:40.000 --> 22:43.000
and there are structures that you are guiding towards,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
and that's what we see with life.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
It has this massive amount of complexity,

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
but it's channeled through somehow fixed pathways.

22:52.000 --> 22:56.000
And I think that is something where we're still lacking the mathematical language.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
So the amount of data that's currently being gathered in the life science,

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
I think it almost doubles every six months.

23:04.000 --> 23:08.000
I think that actually is something where new kind of mathematics could emerge.

23:08.000 --> 23:12.000
What I find so exciting is that I would see this tremendous transition

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
that we're going through in science now,

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
that we found the building blocks, the building blocks of matter,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
and also the building blocks of life,

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
and now the question is what can we build out of that?

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
So talking about infinite universes of possibilities,

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
and somehow life is finding its way through that infinity,

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
what are somehow the calculations that life is making

23:36.000 --> 23:41.000
when it builds a protein, when it builds a cell, when it builds an organism?

23:41.000 --> 23:48.000
It's such an efficient computer that I think this kind of information processing point of view

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
will be extremely promising.

23:50.000 --> 23:54.000
And I feel in some sense, no, scientists are becoming designers or artists.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
If an artist, he put a pen on paper,

23:57.000 --> 24:02.000
then immediately you have a shape that has never been made before.

24:02.000 --> 24:07.000
And so what are the ways that guide you in finding interesting shapes?

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
As a modern life scientist, as a quantum material scientist,

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
as an information scientist producing artificial intelligence,

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
all of us become essentially artists,

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
trying to find our ways in this vast space of possibilities.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
This vast space of possibilities, what a wonderful way to portray life.

24:30.000 --> 24:35.000
What an open invitation for mathematics to engage with biology.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.000
Mathematics, of course, is increasingly engaged with biology.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
Statistics are certainly essential for analyzing population data.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
Mathematical models certainly improve experimental design

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
and enable individual predictivity.

24:52.000 --> 24:57.000
The deep question is whether mathematics engagement with biology goes beyond

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
sharper statistics, closer models, better experiments.

25:01.000 --> 25:07.000
The deep question is whether the mathematics of biology goes to fundamental realities.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
Start with this.

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
Mathematical models reveal remarkable common principles

25:13.000 --> 25:17.000
that unify biological phenomena across radically diverse life forms.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Then this.

25:19.000 --> 25:26.000
Could biology, as a wholly different world, be a great gift to mathematics?

25:26.000 --> 25:33.000
I cannot dismiss the big speculative idea that life in our universe is no accident,

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
that life is fundamental,

25:35.000 --> 25:41.000
and that radically novel mathematics might exist at the level of life

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
and exist nowhere else.

25:43.000 --> 25:48.000
Could biology be fundamental, something like physics?

25:48.000 --> 25:53.000
I cannot go all the way with Paul Davies,

25:53.000 --> 26:01.000
although I am tempted and I do hope Paul is closer to truth.
