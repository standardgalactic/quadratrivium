1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
I would like to be able to understand why the laws of physics look the way they do,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,240
but as in terms of why the universe exists, I think that will probably just turn out to be

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,920
an ill-formed question. I think that there's no such thing as the reason why the universe exists.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:32,160
Welcome to Closer to Truth. I'm speaking with physicist and philosopher of physics,

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,360
Sean Carroll, about his superb, valuable new book, Quanta and Fields, the second in Sean's

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,400
acclaimed series, The Biggest Ideas in the Universe. It is the clearest introduction to

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,040
quantum mechanics and related topics with the real math that is both comprehensive and accessible,

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,800
which sounds like an oxymoron, but for Sean it is not. Sean, good to see you again.

9
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,000
Robert, thanks very much for having me on. Always good to be here.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,040
I love the book. It's what I've been looking for. I learned a lot. I need to learn more,

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,760
but before we dive in, let's start with one of the possible implications of quantum theories,

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,720
the many-worlds interpretation, which we'll talk about later in depth, but just briefly,

13
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,040
because I read in the April 9th issue of New Scientist Magazine an article that headlines

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,160
the multiverse could be much, much bigger than we ever imagined, and it considers innumerable

15
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:36,720
subsystems of the world. You're quoted quite extensively, quite well, as taking this seriously.

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,200
Why do you take that seriously? Well, many worlds in general is a wonderful

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,720
and compelling idea. I take it seriously because it's the most straightforward implication of

18
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,480
the equations of quantum mechanics, in particular the Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics.

19
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,680
Every other version of the foundations of quantum mechanics either changes the Schrodinger equation

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,800
sometimes or adds new elements to it or something like that. Let me just be super duper clear for

21
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,120
the listeners. I wrote a whole book about the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics

22
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,560
and why it's good. In these books and the biggest ideas, I don't talk about it that much. I'm much

23
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,080
more focused on what we truly believe that we understand, not speculations that go beyond

24
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,440
our current knowledge. Right. No, that's clear from the book. But in the article, it talks about

25
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,680
the idea of subsystems where any two aspects of the world, what I'm doing here on Earth and

26
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,760
something that just happened in an Alpha Centauri, could be looked upon as a subsystem. Does that in

27
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,160
any way expand the traditional Hugh Everett, traditional interpretation of many worlds?

28
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,160
Because that was the implication of the article. Well, I think that it depends on what you mean

29
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,760
by the interpretation. At its very most basic level, Everett is just saying there is something

30
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,760
called the quantum state, which everyone agrees there is, the vector in Hilbert space, if you

31
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,240
want to be technical about it, but the wave function of the universe, if you want to be poetic.

32
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,200
And it always obeys the Schrodinger equation. That's it. That's the entirety of the

33
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,840
interpretation. Everything else is commentary, including the fact that there are many worlds.

34
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,760
And so there is a long running debate among people who care about the Everett interpretation

35
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,280
about what counts as a world. Where do we draw the dividing line between the different worlds?

36
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,600
And so we're thinking about the possibility that you can be pretty comprehensive in dividing it up

37
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,040
into a very large number of worlds. But the important thing is this doesn't change the

38
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,720
Everett interpretation at all. It's only a question of, is this more a more convenient

39
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,840
way of thinking about it for we limited human beings? Okay, well, there'll be more to come

40
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,720
of many worlds. We'll get into it later in more depth, but it is certainly fascinating.

41
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,960
We'll conduct our discussion in three parts. First, I want to go through each chapter of the

42
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,400
book just to get an overall high level sense of quantum fields. Then I'm going to pick out

43
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,720
several of what I think are interesting issues from the book that we can discuss in some depth.

44
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,120
And then finally, we'll have sort of some speculations about the implications of

45
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,680
quantum mechanics and the nature of reality, all good, close to the true subject. But first,

46
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:26,240
let me give a serious quick bio. Sean Carroll is the Homewood Professor of Natural Philosophy at

47
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,680
Johns Hopkins University, a joint appointment between physics and philosophy. Sean's research

48
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,920
has focused on cosmology, field theory, and gravitation, shifting to more foundational

49
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,960
questions in quantum mechanics. In addition to the biggest ideas in the universe series,

50
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,720
he is the author of many bestselling books, including Something Deeply Hidden, The Big Picture,

51
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,840
and From Eternity to Now. He is the host of the popular Mindscape podcast. Sean, lots to cover.

52
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,880
Again, we're going to use the chapters of your book as a framework. So let's look for a high-level

53
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,480
discussion in the overview, which is just to give some fundamentals. Just define a quanta and fields

54
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:20,480
by contrasting it with what we know from classical physics. Yeah, you know, it's a three-volume series

55
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,280
that we're in the middle of here. Volume one was space, time, and motion, classical physics.

56
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,560
Volume two is quantum physics, but that has to include modern ways of thinking about quantum

57
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,880
physics, which are based on quantum field theory. So a lot of the book is about quantum field theory.

58
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:44,880
Okay, and what is the major contrast between quanta and field? So define each of those terms

59
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:52,640
briefly. The idea of quanta comes from the fact that we actually, in the formulation of the theory,

60
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,800
quantum mechanics, we don't think about a lattice or discreteness or pixels or anything like that.

61
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,760
Everything is smooth and continuous, but when we observe it, the world appears to us in lumps,

62
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:10,400
in particles, which we call quanta, and fields are the fact that the thing that we quantize

63
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,200
to get our best picture of nature are fields that fill all of space rather than particles

64
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,440
that have a definite location. Okay, and that's a very significant point. A major part of the book

65
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,840
and we'll get into that. Okay, chapter one is on the wave function, giving the position and

66
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,920
momentum of every constituent, specifies a classical system, and giving the wave function

67
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:38,320
specifies the quantum state of a system. Yeah, this was a dramatic change because Isaac Newton,

68
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,000
we thought, had laid down the law for classical mechanics. What the world is, is some things

69
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,680
with positions and momenta. Quantum mechanics comes along and says, no, there's something called the

70
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,840
wave function, and we can figure out how to predict things as best we can from it, but it's an utterly

71
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:04,000
different thing than Newton would have thought. And for the wave function, that is not designed

72
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,320
as a representation of reality. It means it is reality. It's a big difference in science.

73
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:18,640
We don't agree. No one knows. I think that reality is completely represented by the wave function.

74
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,320
In other words, reality is reality, but the wave function is in a mathematical one-to-one

75
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,760
correspondence with reality. Others think that it's only part of reality or it has nothing to do

76
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,600
with reality. So that's where opinions differ. Okay, sounds like a big difference. So you bring

77
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,760
up the Schrodinger equation very briefly. Describe it. The Schrodinger equation is what replaces

78
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:47,840
in quantum mechanics f equals ma from classical mechanics, the equation of motion Newton's second

79
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,560
law. It's the thing that says, okay, I've told you what the world is. Newton would have said

80
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,320
positions in momentum. Quantum mechanics says it's a wave function. Now tell me how it evolves,

81
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,840
how it changes over time. That's what the Schrodinger equation does.

82
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,720
Great. And one other point from this chapter, which comes out as important, is when you use the

83
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,560
Hamiltonian, which you discussed in your first book, in quantum mechanics, that becomes an operator.

84
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,280
And so give us just some sense of what an operator is in terms of a mathematical function

85
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,720
that characterizes quantum mechanics versus classical mechanics.

86
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,680
Yeah. So I was happy enough in book one to talk about something called the Hamiltonian,

87
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,960
which is a fancy way of saying the energy of a system as a function of the positions and

88
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,560
momenta of everything. So you have some complicated arrangement of stuff. And the Hamiltonian is

89
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,000
one number. It's the energy of that particular arrangement of stuff. In quantum mechanics,

90
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,760
the Hamiltonian, like many other things, is not a number. It's an operator, which means I start

91
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,320
with a wave function with some quantum mechanical state. And the Hamiltonian operates on that to

92
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,720
give me a different wave function. And then I can do things with it like plug it into the Schrodinger

93
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,160
equation. Good. So that's a very significant difference. Okay. Chapter two is on measurement.

94
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,520
Let's start very quickly is what is the measurement problem?

95
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,560
Well, this is the big thing for the foundations of quantum mechanics, right? Because

96
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,120
if all that had happened when we invented quantum mechanics was to replace positions and momenta

97
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,120
with wave functions, that would be slightly annoying, but we would deal with it waves are

98
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,200
things that physicists know how to deal with very, very well. The problem is that when you look at

99
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,360
a quantum system, it doesn't look like a wave function. It looks like particles or something

100
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,200
like that. So the measurement problem is, what do you mean when you say look at a system? What

101
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:49,840
exactly happens? What counts as a measurement? What can make it happen? What kind of agents can

102
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:56,240
make it happen? Why are measurements important at all? Yeah, and many people extrapolate that

103
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,320
significantly to say there has to be a conscious observer. And this has great philosophical

104
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,520
implications about the nature of reality or the nature of consciousness, which I don't think we

105
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,640
agree with. Well, I don't agree with it. I'm not going to put words in anyone else's. Well, I think

106
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,200
we mean you and I. Yeah, right. So, you know, we don't know what the answer to this measurement

107
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,720
problem is, but it's not that we have no good ideas. We have lots of good ideas. And what we

108
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,440
teach our students is not very good, is not very sensible, is not very coherent. It's just that

109
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,480
when you measure something, the wave function suddenly changes, it collapses. But you're not

110
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,360
allowed to ask what it means to do a measurement, to what counts as a measurement. So it's good

111
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,320
enough. That sort of half baked version of quantum mechanics is good enough to win many,

112
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,360
many Nobel Prizes. But it's not quite precise and clear enough to be a well formulated theory of

113
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,240
reality. In this chapter, just give some sense of what Hilbert space is and how that compares

114
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,720
with regular space and why that's important in quantum mechanics. Yeah, it's too bad that the

115
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,040
word space is used here. And I blame the mathematicians for this. They consider any set

116
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,800
with interesting structures on it to be called a space, right? So the space of all possible,

117
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,280
blah, blah, blah, very different than the three dimensional space that you and I live in. So Hilbert

118
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,880
space is the mathematical space where all of the wave functions live. Every possible quantum state

119
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,280
of the universe is an element of Hilbert space. And John von Neumann, the famous physicist and

120
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:39,280
mathematician, showed that mathematically, Hilbert space is a vector space. That means that

121
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,760
quantum states are vectors. You can add them together. You can, they have a direction, they

122
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,720
have a magnitude. They don't have a direction in physical space in the three dimensional world.

123
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,520
They have a direction in this gigantically dimensioned thing called Hilbert space.

124
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,800
Chapter three entanglement. A very interesting point you make is that when we think classically,

125
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,200
we think particles. And when we think in quantum, we first think of the quantum state, then particles.

126
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,560
Yeah. And importantly, when you have more than one particle in classical mechanics,

127
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,400
it's not a big deal. You just add more particles. You describe each particle individually. The

128
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,720
classical world is separable. You can treat each part of it all by itself and then add in what

129
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,800
its interactions are with the rest of the world. Entanglement in quantum mechanics says the quantum

130
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,840
world is not like that. There are not separate quantum states for different parts of the universe.

131
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:42,240
There is only one wave function for the whole universe all at once. And that has important

132
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,320
experimental implications. You can measure one part of the universe and that tells you something

133
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,480
about the possible measurement outcomes somewhere else.

134
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,600
Chapter four is on fields, a very important part of the book because quantum field theory,

135
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,160
as you state, is the single best way to describe the universe at its deepest known level. So

136
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,760
quantum field theory really becomes the foundation out of which quantum mechanics and

137
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,320
particles emerge. Yeah. And I want to emphasize there's 12 chapters in the book and only three

138
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,000
of them are about quantum mechanics by itself. We move very quickly onto fields because it's such

139
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,160
a rich, amazingly deep subject. And so in this chapter, chapter four, we just make our lives

140
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,040
very, very simple. We say, what if there was just one field in the universe and it didn't interact

141
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,240
with anything else? It's all by itself. And what we show is that when you apply the rules of

142
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:45,360
quantum mechanics to that situation, that field acts like a collection of particles or

143
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,720
more specifically, because quantum mechanics lets us consider super positions of different

144
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,880
things like Schrodinger's cat being partly awake and partly asleep. You can have a quantum field

145
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,520
representing zero particles and also one particle and also two particles, etc. all the way up all at

146
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:12,480
once. And significantly, then particles are really the quantized excitation of fields as opposed to

147
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,160
entities in themselves. This is, I think, one of the most fundamental points.

148
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,400
Absolutely. It surely is. As I say in the book, if you were a physicist working at the end of

149
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:30,000
the 1800s, you would have been forgiven for thinking we were almost done with physics.

150
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,520
Classical mechanics seemed pretty good. And you could divide the world into particles and fields,

151
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:41,120
particles like electrons or atoms, fields like the electromagnetic field, the gravitational field,

152
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:49,680
and so on. And quantum field theory unifies all of that. It's all fields. But when you look at

153
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,960
fields, when you measure them in precisely the right way, they appear to us as particles. So

154
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:01,120
it's really only one thing going on deep down. So the implication that particles are quantized

155
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:09,600
excitation of fields answers a fundamental question with all the number of electrons in the

156
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,240
universe or protons 10 to the 80 or whatever the number is. How could they all be exactly the same?

157
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,840
Because it just seems impossible. But when you think of them as not as entities that we have to

158
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:30,160
explain why they're all the same, but they're all the product of a field, the answer becomes obvious.

159
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,920
You know, you're right. There are about 10 to the 80th electrons in the observable universe. You

160
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,160
got the right number there. I'm very impressed. That was very nice. And you're also right that

161
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,680
the reason why every electron is identical to every other electron is because fundamentally,

162
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,560
the world is not made of electrons or other particles. It's made of fields. And there's

163
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,400
something called the electron field. And when you poke at it and make a little vibration,

164
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,680
that shows up to us as an electron particle. But the underlying field has the same physical

165
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,720
properties no matter when or where you are in the universe. So every electron looks identical

166
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,880
to us. And not only look, but they actually are. They actually are. And quantum mechanics has

167
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:20,080
a lot to say about that. Yes. Chapter five interactions. Well, of course, this is where

168
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,440
things truly become exciting and mind bending. Because in the previous chapter, we show that

169
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,560
if you had just one field all by itself, not interacting with anything, it would look like

170
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,800
particles. But there's nothing to look at it, right? In order to look at it, you need other

171
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,320
fields interacting with it. And that's where we get to talk about Feynman diagrams. Feynman was

172
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,640
the one who really showed us how to think about interacting quantum fields. Two electrons come

173
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,160
close together. They interact by tossing back and forth some photons or some other particles.

174
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,760
They scatter off to go elsewhere. Sometimes the answer is infinity, which worries you. That'll

175
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:03,600
be another chapter. But the point is, there's a recipe for going from some specific kind of

176
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,920
interactions that you specify dynamically to all these little pictures of what happens,

177
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,600
which gives you a way of calculating your quantum mechanical probabilities.

178
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:26,560
On a simple look, Feynman diagrams just seem almost Lego simplistic. Why are they so powerful

179
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,320
when they look so simple? Well, that's a great question. One of the motivations behind writing

180
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,960
this book is to move beyond the idea that Feynman diagrams are just cartoons. Because in a book

181
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,920
like this, my grand ambition is to show people the equations, to unveil the specific quantitative

182
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:52,000
relationships beneath the metaphors and analogies that we usually get. So in a traditional popular

183
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,040
science treatment, including ones that I've given myself, you will draw a Feynman diagram and you'll

184
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,000
say, this represents this interaction, blah, blah, blah. But you're left a little unsatisfied,

185
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,440
because why do I have to draw that diagram? So here in this book, we explain that every diagram

186
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,560
is a number. Diagrams can be used to calculate quantum mechanical amplitudes, basically to

187
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,560
calculate the wave function for this particular process. And from that, we can get the probability

188
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,720
of observing that process. So they're not just cute little pictures of what happens.

189
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,320
They're fiercely quantitative ways of measuring and characterizing the probability that something

190
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,400
happens. Chapter six, effective field theory. This is my favorite chapter. I don't know if it's

191
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,720
going to be anybody else's favorite chapter, but you know, we alluded to the fact that these

192
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,920
Feynman diagrams, which are supposed to help us calculate things, can easily lead to trouble

193
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,680
because you calculate a number and the number is infinity. And this seems bad. And so Feynman

194
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,000
and Schwinger and Tom and Aga won the Nobel Prize for wrestling with this, showing us that we could

195
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
get away with it. But it always seemed a little unsatisfying, the process called renormalization.

196
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,560
Feynman himself was not happy with renormalization throughout his life.

197
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,960
It just sounds like a fudge factor.

198
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:18,560
It does sound like that. But basically, it was all figured out by Ken Wilson in the 60s and 70s.

199
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:24,720
And somehow the world doesn't know about this and the world should know about this. What Wilson said

200
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,320
is that the reason why Feynman diagrams give you infinity is because you're including particles

201
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,960
with infinitely big energies. And you don't know what's going on when particles have infinitely

202
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:41,760
big energies. Maybe space time doesn't exist or something like that. So he showed us how to just

203
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,320
remove those unwanted, ill understood parts from our Feynman diagrams. And we are left with what

204
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,840
is called an effective field theory, because they are very, very effective. Chapter seven,

205
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,640
which is one of my favorite chapters, which you call scale. And you introduce the idea of scale

206
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,120
by saying the number of nucleons of basic Newtonian protons in various orders of magnitude.

207
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,960
Human DNA or bacterium would have 10 to the 12th. A human being would have 10 to the 28th.

208
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:20,160
The Earth would have 10 to the 51. The Sun would have 10 to the 57. So that's a million times

209
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:27,040
more. Exponent of 6 is a million. And so the Earth is roughly a millionth the size of the Sun,

210
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:33,200
which is right. Milky Way Galaxy, 10 to the 70th. I think that looks like 10 trillion suns,

211
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,400
which is more than the number of stars in the galaxy. But there's a lot of gas and other stuff.

212
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,440
So that's order of magnitude, right? And then the whole observable universe, 10 to the 80th,

213
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:53,280
which is 10 billion galaxies, seems actually low. Because I think that now 10 trillion,

214
00:20:53,600 --> 00:21:00,240
maybe it should be 10 to the 82nd. But you see this beautiful hierarchy. And to me, that's the

215
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,720
best, simplest way to get a sense of the structure of reality. I mean, it's literally breathtaking.

216
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,960
Yeah, you know, this chapter is kind of a reward. It's a little respite. You know,

217
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,840
you've just done the last couple of chapters, you're pretty heavy going.

218
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:23,920
Yeah, it's a lot. And so we want to like put it together. And as you see, as you say,

219
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,240
reflect on the beautiful structure that comes out of this, because this talk about quantum

220
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,520
mechanics and field theory, sometimes it said, this describes the world of the very small,

221
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,240
but actually describes the whole world, including the very big, he says, you don't need it to describe

222
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,960
most features of galaxies or stars. You need it when you get down to subatomic particles,

223
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,840
but they all fit in to the quantum field theory framework.

224
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:56,320
An interesting point in this chapter, which is a great way to understand how the world works,

225
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,800
is the fact that we know that that protons and neutrons are made up of quarks, three quarks,

226
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:10,320
different colors or characteristic strangeness. And they come together in different ways. And

227
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:17,840
we think that's what composes it. And they're held together with the boson, the force of gluons.

228
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:24,640
But the point that you make, which is the critical point, is that if you took out all the quarks,

229
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:31,680
and only had the equivalent masses of the of the of the force, which is the gluons,

230
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,440
the total mass wouldn't get that much less. I mean, that's a that's an astounding idea.

231
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:44,800
Yeah, you know, this is why it's necessary and useful to think about quantum field theory, because

232
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,320
sometimes when you have an electron going through your bubble chamber or whatever,

233
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,920
you don't need to think about the details of quantum field theory. You can just think of

234
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:00,320
it as a particle moving in a certain trajectory. But inside a proton or a neutron, the world is

235
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,800
very different from the world of our intuition of particles and so forth. So we're told once again,

236
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:13,680
in the pop science level, that a proton has three quarks inside. But the mass of the proton is much

237
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:19,760
bigger than the sum of the masses of those quarks. And also another thing that I go through in the

238
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,680
book is there's something called the Compton wavelength of a particle, which is roughly, you

239
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:31,760
know, the size you can squeeze its wave function down to. And the Compton wavelength of a quark

240
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,520
is much bigger than the size of the proton that it squeezed into. So what is going on here?

241
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,280
And the answer is that you should read the book because it's all about quantum field theory and

242
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,440
all does make sense. Okay, so now I'm going to go quickly through some of the later chapters.

243
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,720
Eight is symmetry. Symmetry is very important, you know, whenever you hear things like the

244
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:57,280
standard model is an SU three cross SU two cross you one gauge theory. What do all of those symbols

245
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,600
mean? What do all those words mean? It's all about symmetry and group theory. And that's

246
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,120
why I explained this in the book. Chapter nine is gauge theory, which is a particular kind of field

247
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,680
theory. That's right. So the previous chapter was about the mathematics of symmetry. Gauge theories

248
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,000
are putting that mathematics to work in quantum field theory. It is the existence of certain

249
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,160
kinds of symmetries gauge symmetries that give rise to the forces of nature. The reason why there

250
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:32,000
are forces is because of a symmetry in the underlying quantum field theory. And this transformation

251
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:39,520
can be done at every at any point in space time. That's what the word gauge means in gauge symmetry.

252
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,280
It means that I have red, green and blue quarks, for example, that's a three dimensional space,

253
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:51,040
and I can rotate it. That's a symmetry in SU three symmetry, but I can rotate it separately at every

254
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:57,440
point in space time. And that means I need a new field to be able to connect them. That field

255
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,160
turns out to be the glue on which holds particles together. One of the points you made out a little

256
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:12,160
difficulty with is from gauge theory, you can derive the idea that the force carrying particles

257
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:21,040
are naturally massless like the like the photon, etc. I didn't quite get that. How you how you so

258
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,360
quickly get to that conclusion, which is obviously important. Yeah, it is. So we talk about in earlier

259
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,600
chapters, what it looks like when a field has a mass, it all comes down to the dynamics of the field,

260
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,440
it's a way for the field to interact with itself, so that its particles move slower than the speed

261
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,480
of light and have what we would call a mass, the more force you put on them, the more they accelerate

262
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,480
like F equals MA in Newton's laws. Now gauge symmetries come along, and there's a symmetry there

263
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,800
which very, very tightly restricts the possible terms you can write down in the equations of

264
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:03,040
motion for these particles. And it turns out that the particular kind of interaction you need

265
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:09,440
to give those particles a mass is forbidden by the symmetry. It would break the symmetry if you

266
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,520
just naively wrote it down. Well, you can write it down, people did, and they're like, ah, now it's

267
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:20,000
not gauge invariant anymore. So that symmetry not only gives rise to a new force, but it implies

268
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,200
that the particles carrying that force should be massless, whether they're photons or gravitons

269
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:32,400
or gluons. Chapter 10 phases. This is a big one because I just told you that gauge symmetries

270
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:38,640
imply that force carrying particles are massless. But in nature, we have things called the WNZ

271
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,400
bosons, which are force carrying particles which are not massless. What's going on with that?

272
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,120
And the answer is that gauge theories can appear in different phases, very analogous to like the

273
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,360
phases of water being ice or liquid or vapor. There's different ways to apparently break the

274
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,800
symmetry, not really break it, but hide it. And that gives masses to the WNZ bosons, not to mention

275
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:09,360
particles like the electron and the quarks. I'm very familiar, most people are with the standard

276
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:18,080
model of particle physics. Stephen Weinberg, particularly, is personifies that you introduced

277
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:25,760
the idea or explained the idea of core theory as well. So how does the standard model articulate

278
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,680
with core theory? I borrowed that term from Frank Wilczek, who introduced it. And it's basically

279
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:38,960
a way of reminding you that gravity is less of a bad fit than you might think. We have this thing,

280
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,640
we say, we don't understand quantum gravity, etc., etc. What would be more accurate to say

281
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,240
is that we don't have a full, complete, final theory of quantum gravity. We don't have a theory

282
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,400
of quantum gravity that includes black holes or the big bang or things like that. But as long as

283
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,080
gravity is relatively weak, like all the solar system, including the sun, the earth, etc.,

284
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,120
we're nowhere near making a black hole. Gravity is pretty weak. Under those circumstances,

285
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,360
we understand quantum gravity fine. So the core theory is just the standard model of particle

286
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:20,080
physics plus gravity in that weak field regime. Okay, so the standard model is a subset of core

287
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:27,520
theory with the asterisk that this applies to low levels of gravity. Yeah, that's exactly right.

288
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:34,800
Okay, good. Okay, chapter 11 on matters, bringing things together. Well, matter could mean almost

289
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,160
anything. But what I took it to mean, but I wanted to explain was why when you have certain kinds of

290
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:46,720
fields, bosons, like the Higgs boson or the photon or whatever, they can pile on top of each other

291
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,800
and give you a classical force field. Whereas other kinds of particles, fermions, like electrons

292
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:58,720
and neutrinos and quarks, they take up space. They make up matter. The table in front of you or

293
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,160
whatever has a certain solidity, a certain density, because some particles take up space.

294
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:19,440
I explain why in this chapter. Okay. And that's why my hand don't pass. I can't

295
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,360
indigitate. I can't put my hand through a table. And that's because the difference between the

296
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:31,280
matter and the forces. The reason why you can punch somebody effectively is ultimately because

297
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,400
electrons do not want to be in the same quantum state. Yes.

298
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:43,280
Okay, chapter 12, Adams. Yeah. So for the final chapter, we put it all together and we answer

299
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,240
the question, if there's all these particles out there, you know, Higgs bosons and top quarks and

300
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:55,360
whatever, why are you and I made of so few particles, electrons, protons, neutrons, you know, a couple

301
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,320
of force carrying particles. So we talked about the dynamics of these particles and how they decay

302
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:06,720
into each other. What are the stable final particles? Why do neutrons become stable inside

303
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,000
a nucleus, but not outside a nucleus? How does it all fit together to make up the periodic table

304
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,360
of the elements? And the big question of a baryon asymmetry, where in the early universe,

305
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:26,640
I think you say there were 10 billion anti baryon particles versus 10 billion plus one

306
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,280
baryon and therefore all the 10 billion canceled out, but the one left over out of 10 billion

307
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:41,200
becomes the entire universe. That's exactly right. And we don't know why. And I'm going to be very

308
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,920
honest. I'm not going to tell you why in this book, because I'm sticking to things that we know,

309
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,680
that's when we don't know the answer to. Yeah. And that you said it before, but it's an important

310
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,440
point about the book. We have these very speculative ideas. You've dealt with it in other books. But

311
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,840
this book is really the depth of the understanding of what we do know and what we're sure of and

312
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,760
how that works. Okay, let's go into our second part, which is just taking some of the issues that

313
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:15,760
are just fascinating and dealing. And let's start with wave particle duality. And in particular,

314
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:22,000
the celebrated double slit experiment. And why is that so important? Yeah, you know, wave particle

315
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,760
duality is honestly overrated. I think Edward Whitten once said, the battle is over, the waves

316
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:34,560
have won. The world is clearly made of waves. But it appears like particles under certain

317
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,720
circumstances. That's the magic of quantum measurement. What the world is is very wave,

318
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,760
very field like. But under the right circumstances, when you measure something, it looks like a

319
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,760
particle. The double slit experiment is a famous example of that, where you say a single electron

320
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,360
can pass through two slits and interfere with itself. If you really just accept that electrons

321
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,000
are not particles, they're described by wave functions. That's the least surprising thing in

322
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,160
the world. Waves can interfere with each other. Right. And how deeply do we understand that?

323
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,320
Some would speculate that the double split experiment is evidence for the many world

324
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,960
interpretation. You wouldn't go that far, would you? I would not go that far. I think, again,

325
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:27,680
all you need to believe in is the reality of wave functions. Now, some people don't. Some people

326
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,920
think that wave functions are just ways to calculate experimental outcomes, and we should

327
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:38,400
not attribute reality to them. And I think that those people have a very difficult time in explaining

328
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,000
things like the double slit experiment. They can do it, but they kind of have to bend over

329
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,160
backwards to do it. So if you just trust the equations, if you just believe what is sitting

330
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:52,640
right in front of your face, here's a wave function, here's the equation it obeys,

331
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,240
everything, I think, makes perfect sense. I don't think the double slit is especially mysterious.

332
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,560
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is almost a household world and is used in many,

333
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:09,520
in many forms. One of the highlights of the book to me was understanding it in its deeper meaning

334
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,880
and to really appreciate why it is the case. So give me a brief sense of that.

335
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:22,240
Yeah, you know, it's, again, not a postulate of quantum mechanics. It's something that pops out

336
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,520
of the formalism of quantum mechanics. But it's fascinating to me because Isaac Newton

337
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,720
in his formulation of classical mechanics says very clearly, you need to tell me

338
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,920
the position of something and its momentum, and then I can predict where it will go. The state

339
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:43,520
of something is its position and its momentum. Quantum mechanics comes along and says my wave

340
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:50,160
function is psi of x. That is to say, for every possible position of the particle,

341
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,120
I can attach a wave function number and I would square that to get the probability of observing

342
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,440
it. So where did P go? What happened to momentum? P is the letter that we use for momentum. How can

343
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:08,000
you possibly capture everything there is about the system in terms of just the wave function

344
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,920
as a function of position? So I explain the answer to that. We know what the answer is.

345
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,240
And the answer is, remember, quantum states are vectors in Hilbert space. And basically,

346
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,680
when you have a vector, if you just do have x, y, and z, then you have components of the vector.

347
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,920
You've chosen a basis. You're going to tell me what the vector is by giving you the components.

348
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,960
In quantum mechanics, the relationship between position and momentum is changing bases,

349
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:41,680
changing the fundamental axes along which you measure your vector. And then if you believe that,

350
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:47,120
if position is one kind of basis, momentum is a different kind of basis, the uncertainty

351
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,120
principle is automatically true. It's almost trivial. In fact, there are physicists out there

352
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:55,680
who will say, oh, it's just obvious. You shouldn't be worried about it. Because if you've rotated

353
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:04,080
your vectors, you can't be completely 100% in a direction in one basis and also complete 100%

354
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,320
along an axis in the different basis because they're rotated with respect to each other. So

355
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,880
that's an example. It's a great example where a little bit of math, I think, makes everything

356
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:22,240
much, much clearer. And it pops out, as you said. It's a forced realization as opposed to a brilliant

357
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,440
new idea. Yeah. I mean, it was a brilliant new idea when Heisenberg came up with it. But honestly,

358
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,720
we understand quantum mechanics better now than we did in those early days. So it does,

359
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,560
once you understand what quantum mechanics is trying to tell you, the uncertainty principle

360
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,720
just comes along for the ride. You make the statement that entanglement helps us understand

361
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,120
measurement. That was to be one of the most interesting statements in the book. These are two

362
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,840
of the most important aspects of quantum mechanics, obviously, and you link them together. How does

363
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:01,840
that happen? Yeah, you know, I actually struggled while writing the book with the fact that we

364
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,880
don't agree on the basic language with which to talk about quantum mechanics. We don't agree on

365
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,840
whether wave functions are real or not. And I decided that, you know, rather than on every page

366
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,840
saying, well, if you think this, you would say this thing. And then this, you know, that would

367
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:23,520
just drag it down. So I said, we're going to talk as if wave functions are real. I happen to think

368
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,320
that they are, I happen to think that is the right way to think about reality. But it certainly

369
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,160
provides a much easier way of talking about what happens in quantum mechanics. And if you accept

370
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,000
that, then we have an answer to the question, what do you mean by doing a measurement? And the

371
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,880
answer is a measurement happens when a quantum mechanical system that again, it can be in a

372
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,720
superposition like spin up and spin down at some fraction of each all by itself. That's fine.

373
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,680
A measurement is when that system becomes entangled with the rest of the world. And that's when

374
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:02,960
the two parts of the superposition are no longer sort of living by themselves. They're now related

375
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,800
to everything else in the universe. That's what we call a measurement. Okay, you also make the

376
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,000
point we talked about a little bit earlier of the wave function of the universe that and the basic

377
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,520
idea I think is that no matter how you define your system, whether it's, as you said, two particles

378
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:26,240
or the entire universe, there's still only one wave function of that system. So give me some color

379
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,280
around that. Yeah, you know, this is one of the things that is very, very difficult for people

380
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,960
to wrap their brains around. Because we look at the world around us, we see many separate objects,

381
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,440
that just seems to be pretty obvious. And quantum mechanics, to put it in closer to truth language,

382
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,400
is more of a monist theory. It says there's really only one thing the wave function of the

383
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,200
entire universe. And so people struggle to understand it. But what I would advocate is just

384
00:37:53,840 --> 00:38:00,640
accepting that, accept that there is only one thing and ask the other way, ask, why does this

385
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:06,320
one thing, the wave function of the universe, appear to us as many things? That's the surprising

386
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,920
thing. Why does it look like apparently the world is made of many separate things? And there,

387
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,240
that's an answerable question. It comes down again to measurement, what we call decoherence,

388
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,200
which is when these quantum systems that are in a superposition become entangled with the rest of

389
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:29,200
the world. And it all does ultimately make sense, even if it doesn't come close to our everyday

390
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:35,840
intuitions. What is the hierarchy problem? Well, we mentioned before the core theory, right,

391
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:41,200
the standard model of particle physics plus gravity. It's a theory that fits essentially

392
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,440
all of the data that we have from laboratory experiments here on earth. It doesn't fit

393
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,240
some things in outer space, which is why we need dark matter and dark energy, etc. But here on

394
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,720
earth, it does a very good job. The problem is, even though it fits the data, there are parameters,

395
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:03,360
coupling constants, numbers inside the core theory that are very, very surprising, that are not at

396
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,800
all what we would expect if those numbers were just chosen randomly. The hierarchy problem refers

397
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,240
to the fact that there are two parameters. One is the Planck scale, the scale at which gravity

398
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,160
becomes important, okay, 10 to the 18 billion electron volts. And then there is the mass of

399
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:26,400
the Higgs boson, which tells us the electroweak scale, the scale for particle physics, if you like.

400
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:33,440
And that's at about 100 billion electron volts. But if you read chapter six on effective field

401
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,880
theory, you will learn that particle physicists see no reason why these two scales should be so

402
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,240
different from each other. You would naturally expect them to be very similar to each other,

403
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,720
and they're different by a factor of 10 to the 16, which is just a little crazy. That's the hierarchy

404
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,600
problem. We still don't know the answer to it. And also, how about the relationship between the

405
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:04,160
powers of the forces between the electromagnetic and the gravitational power of forces? There's a

406
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:11,280
huge difference. Once again, if you're just imagining a universe or a world, you wouldn't

407
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,520
think there'd be such a vast difference in scale. Yeah, this is where it becomes very,

408
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,800
very tricky because you have to ask, you know, how do you measure these things? Like, after all,

409
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,600
the electromagnetic force between two neutrons is zero. But the electromagnetic force between

410
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:36,160
two protons is considerable. Gravity is different because everything is affected by gravity. So

411
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,040
the difference in the strength of the forces is actually not something that physicists spend a lot

412
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,720
of time dwelling on. That's harder to sort of know what your expectations should have been.

413
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,720
There's something called the weak gravity conjecture that conjectures that there are good

414
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:59,120
reasons why gravity has to be the weakest force. But honestly, that's beyond the scope of the book

415
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:04,160
here. So we're trying to stick to things in this book that everyone will still agree on 500 years

416
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:10,560
from now. Good. Well, that's a challenge. But I think that's a very admirable one and that and

417
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:20,000
very clear in terms of the purpose of the book. In that area of hierarchy, and we have the cosmological

418
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,680
constant, which, as you point out, very strongly is the vacuum energy of empty space, quote, unquote.

419
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,720
But the difference between the calculated theoretical value and the observational value

420
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:43,600
is, as you say, 10 to the minus 122. So that's 10 to the minus 122 zeros, which is

421
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:51,440
the largest mismatch in all of physics and all of reality in terms of the relationship between

422
00:41:51,440 --> 00:42:01,200
theory and experimental observation. What does that tell us? Well, we're not sure what it tells

423
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,480
us, to be perfectly honest. Again, this is an open problem. I think that the contribution of a book

424
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,480
like Quantum Fields is that the reader can truly understand the problem in a way that it's harder

425
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:19,200
to do otherwise. Because once you understand what quantum field theory is, and once you understand

426
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,520
how effective field theory works, now you can follow the argument that says something like

427
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:32,640
the vacuum energy should be a certain number. Because it's certainly not a clear crisp prediction,

428
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,120
right? We actually don't know what the vacuum energy should be. We have rough back of the

429
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:43,840
envelope expectations for what it should be. And if it had been off by 10 to the two or 10 to the

430
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,760
three, then we would have dealt with that. We would have rolled with that and said, okay, that's how

431
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,400
the cookie crumbles. But when it's off by 10 to the 122, then we go, you know, I bet there's a reason

432
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,000
why. I bet there's an explanation. I bet this is not just luck, right? And again, I'm not going to

433
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,040
tell you what the answer is in this book, but I'm going to help you appreciate why physicists think

434
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,880
it's a real problem. And the quantum field theory is the foundation of what creates the problem in

435
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:18,880
a sense. 100%. You know, quantum field theory is super, super, super successful at fitting the

436
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:27,600
data. Once you put in these incredibly finely tuned, seemingly unnatural parameters for certain

437
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:34,480
parts of the laws of physics. So it's kind of a weird problem. It's not the usual thing in science

438
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,680
where we have a theory, it makes a prediction, and then the experiment says, no, that's not it.

439
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,080
This is not a place where we have a prediction. We have a feeling, we have vibes, right? And so

440
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,520
the question of how seriously we should take that is a very good one.

441
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:55,680
Okay, now we go on to part three, which is pure speculation. And so we want to emphasize that

442
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:03,120
the book gives everyone the the capacity to understand the what is real and what is known

443
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:12,320
today, and can therefore look at speculative ideas from the found from the unified foundation that

444
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:18,960
we have of particularly quantum field theory. So what comes now is pure speculation, Sean.

445
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:26,880
You know, we're just going to just ask your feelings and we'll hold you to them if you want

446
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,520
to change it the next time we talk. So the first one, I've got to go back to the many worlds

447
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:39,440
interpretation, which you have forcefully and very strongly articulated and advocate.

448
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,960
And I don't want to, obviously, there are differences. There's, you know, pilot wave,

449
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,280
Bohmian mechanical, all sorts of different explanations. But I don't want to put that

450
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,520
aside. I want to say, okay, if the many worlds interpretation is real, if that is the way

451
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:03,440
reality is, you know, how does it work? I mean, there are 10 to the 80th, the numbers of particles,

452
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:11,920
maybe 10 to the 90th photons, each one can can be analyzed in terms of the plank time of each one,

453
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,480
and different relationship. How do you deal with the way to even think about the number of worlds?

454
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:24,080
Is it, you know, 10 to the 80th or 90th factorial in some sense per plank time? I mean,

455
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:28,880
I just want to get a sense of the, the order of magnitude of how you think about many worlds.

456
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,960
Yeah, I mean, the real answer there is I don't think about all those other worlds that much.

457
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,800
Again, the worlds are a prediction of the theory. They're not what the theory is fundamentally about.

458
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:47,280
The theory says the world, the total world, the whole universe, what we can see and what we can't

459
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,880
is described by quantum mechanical wave function. And that wave function obeys the Schrodinger

460
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,520
equation. That's the theory. And we're trying to work out the consequences of that theory.

461
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:03,120
One of the consequences is when you do a quantum mechanical measurement, and again,

462
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:07,840
measurement can be defined independently of people or consciousness is just about becoming

463
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:15,280
entangled with the rest of the world. The world branches into multiple somewhat classical looking

464
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,280
parts, the different parts look individually almost classical, but they're separate from each

465
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,480
other because in one the spin was up and the other was the spin was down. I appreciate and

466
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,280
understand all of that. I'm just trying to get a sense of the order of magnitude of the numbers.

467
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,640
If we take, you know, a period of time, one second, could you invite into the plank time,

468
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:42,800
how many different total worlds emerge from that given the number of the particles in the

469
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,440
observable universe? Right. And I'm trying to convince you to not worry about that. That's the

470
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:54,880
wrong question to worry about. Let me say two things. Number one, we don't know is the answer

471
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:01,280
because in order to know that, you would have to know the dimensionality of Hilbert space of the

472
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,560
fundamental theory of everything. And we don't know that right now. Can you give me some boundaries?

473
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:14,160
I'm trying. I'm trying. It could be infinite, right? For many simple quantum mechanical systems,

474
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,400
the best description is in terms of an infinite dimensional Hilbert space.

475
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:24,080
And in that case, it would be strictly nonsensical to ask how many worlds are there. It's like

476
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:30,880
saying how many points are there between zero and one. But what you can do is compare the number of

477
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,560
points between zero and point one to the number of points between zero and one. You can give the

478
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:42,080
relative amount of worlds with certain qualities and that many worlds is able to do very, very well.

479
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:48,480
But it's also possible that the magnitude of the dimensionality of Hilbert space is finite.

480
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,640
Indeed, I think that quantum gravity suggests that it probably is finite, at least when you

481
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,000
only consider our observable universe. But the number is very big. The dimensionality of Hilbert

482
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:07,600
space for observable universe is something like 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 120.

483
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,640
So that's plenty of room for lots of worlds to happen. We're not going to run out of room

484
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:22,560
anytime soon. So that's a question of the phase space or the capacity, which is obviously 10 to

485
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:31,280
the 10 to the 120 is enormous. But it doesn't say how many of those occur every period of time.

486
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:38,640
Can you put a bound on that? If many worlds is correct, within a period of time, one second

487
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:44,480
take, what is the lower bound and what is the upper bound? Is there any way you can do that?

488
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:51,120
No, I can't because, again, the theory doesn't talk about worlds. Worlds are things that human

489
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:58,160
beings invent to talk about the wave function of the universe in a convenient way. Two people

490
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:03,200
might decide to divide up the wave function of the universe differently. As long as they agree

491
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,160
on what the wave function of the universe is, they're fine. So the question of what is the

492
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:15,840
number of worlds is just like, what is the number of colors? Okay, let's go on to fine tuning,

493
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:24,240
which has been extant in physics. It's been extant in science, theology, discussions.

494
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,080
How do you view the fine tuning of the universe, particularly in light of quantum field theory?

495
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,880
Well, I think that the word fine tuning gets bounced around in at least two very, very different

496
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:41,040
senses. Very often in the popular discourse, it has something to do with life, that the universe

497
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:48,960
is finely tuned to allow for the existence of life. But physicists will often use the word

498
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:55,760
fine tuning in a way that has nothing to do with life, just to say that certain parameters,

499
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:02,720
like the mass of the Higgs boson, for example, in our equations seem to be represented by adding

500
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:08,640
up many different numbers. And the many different numbers are individually much bigger than the

501
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,520
sum of them that you get for the Higgs boson. And that's not impossible because some of the

502
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:18,880
numbers are positive and some of the numbers are negative, but somehow they cancel out to give you

503
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,360
a much smaller number than you would expect. And that's fine tuning to a physicist. So I think

504
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:29,360
that the fine tuning problems of physics are important clues when we're moving forward to try

505
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,280
to understand the laws of physics better. Whether or not they have anything to do with life,

506
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:39,840
I would not be competent to talk about. And therefore, your feeling is that nobody is competent

507
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:45,120
to talk about that in a fundamental sense. Well, I'm all in favor of talking about it,

508
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:50,320
but remaining humble that we don't know the definition of life, the conditions under which

509
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:55,840
life started, the total set of other possible laws of physics that would allow for life or

510
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:59,280
anything like that. Yeah, and when we talk about life, that's sort of the end result. I mean,

511
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:05,360
we're talking about structure to begin with. Why is there any structure at all that seems to be fine

512
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:10,960
tuned that if various parameters would be off by some argument what it would be, you wouldn't be

513
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,600
able to have any structure at all. Everything would collapse into a black hole or would fly

514
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:23,680
apart without structure. And why we have this so-called fine tuning. So the question is from

515
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:30,880
a quantum field theory point of view, is there any color that one can bring to that kind of question?

516
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:38,800
I don't think that quantum field theory really tells us that much specifically about why and

517
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:45,280
where and how complex structures can evolve. It gives us the basic ingredients out of which

518
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,680
those complex structures evolve. I will tell you that I have a feeling that a lot of people are

519
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:58,080
too quick to say that if conditions were different, complex structures would not be able to evolve.

520
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:03,520
Because guess what? We're very familiar with our conditions. And I don't think that I could hand

521
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,920
most people the standard model of particle physics, and they would successfully predict the

522
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:14,160
periodic table of the elements, much less life and stars and things like that. So again, I just

523
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,960
want to be humble about the question if things were different, would we even be able to imagine

524
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:24,880
life coming into existence? I'm just not used to, in our conversations, humility from either one of

525
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,520
us. So it's a little- You've got to grow in your life, right? You've got to try out new things,

526
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:35,200
put on new hats. I'll take you as a role model and try to follow your humility,

527
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:44,960
attracting persona. Let's go to some basic, closer-to-truth kinds of questions. We've talked

528
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:51,520
about it before. We like to ask the question, what exists by which we mean, what are the

529
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:57,840
fundamental, irreducible categories of reality as few as possible that are irreducible?

530
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:04,960
Yeah. I mean, of course, I wish I knew the answer to that, but my best guess is a quantum wave

531
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:10,080
function obeying the Schrödinger equation. I think that people get a little confused because

532
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:16,400
they will then want to know, well, a wave function of what? When we're taught quantum mechanics,

533
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,920
those of us who went through physics educations, you start with a classical system. Here's a

534
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,240
harmonic oscillator. Here's the electromagnetic field, and then you quantize it, and you get a

535
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:32,240
quantum theory of that. I think that's a little bit misleading because nature doesn't work that way.

536
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:38,560
Nature starts quantum mechanical from the beginning. My best guess as the fundamental

537
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:45,360
thing that exists is some kind of quantum state obeying some kind of Schrödinger equation. Of

538
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:50,240
course, what exact kind we're still trying to figure out? The other question we ask is, why is

539
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,800
there something rather than nothing? Why anything at all? I can put it in a different way. Is

540
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:05,280
there are there brute facts beyond which we cannot proceed even in principle? And if so,

541
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:12,000
what is in that category of brute fact? Yeah, I'm like 99% sure that there are brute facts,

542
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,200
and the existence of the universe itself is one of them. But I don't know exactly which

543
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,880
facts are brute facts and which ones are explicable. I would like to be able to understand why the laws

544
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:29,680
of physics look the way they do. But in terms of why the universe exists, I think that will

545
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:36,080
probably just turn out to be an ill-formed question. I think that there's no such thing as

546
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:42,160
the reason why the universe exists. Okay, that's been great, Sean. I love that again. I recommend

547
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:48,080
the book for everyone who really wants to understand quantum mechanics and quantum field

548
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:54,160
theory as the foundation for all these kind of fun questions. So now we have a couple of

549
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,720
short questions, and these are designed for a stream of consciousness. Just give me a

550
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,560
very quick answer, whatever comes to your mind. So the first one is, what do you think the best

551
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,160
theory is to integrate quantum mechanics and general relativity?

552
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,720
Spacetime emerging from entanglement in the wave function.

553
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:19,600
Question two, roughly, how long do you think it'll be? How many years will it be to get a

554
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:25,360
general consensus on a theory of everything, whether it's what you just said in terms of

555
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,320
integrating quantum mechanics and general relativity or some other theory? I mean,

556
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,760
do you think this would be what happened in our lifetimes?

557
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,840
I'll say between 50 and 100 years. Okay, here's question three. On a scale of 1 to 10,

558
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:44,480
your confidence level that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct

559
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:52,960
and real? 9.5. And next, on a scale of 1 to 10, your confidence level that the standard model of

560
00:55:52,960 --> 00:56:00,320
cosmology, cosmic inflation, the Big Bang, will certainly be refined, but it will not be overthrown.

561
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:06,480
Well, I would say 9.9, but I do not include inflation in the standard model. That's a speculation.

562
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:14,400
Okay, last one on a scale of 1 to 10, your confidence level that the physical world is

563
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:21,360
all there is, that there is no thing that is not physical? 9.99.

564
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:30,560
Okay, well, your humility may have increased since we began speaking, but your opinion of the

565
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:36,320
non-physical has not changed. So we can give you consistency as well as humility.

566
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:44,320
Once again, I love the book. Everybody can learn a great deal from it. I liked how you actually

567
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:51,680
concluded that to understand the particles we're made of, the forces that we interact,

568
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:57,040
is one of humanity's greatest achievements, and you have this very beautiful line at the end.

569
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,800
We can all be a little proud of that. So I love that.

570
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,280
Thanks very much. I mean, technically, I concluded with an appendix where I talk about

571

Fourier transforms, but you're being very nice to talk about the poetic side of the last chapter.

572
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,520

00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:18,720
Once again, Quanten feels indeed the entire, Sean's entire series, the biggest ideas in the

574
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:25,040
universe, has my highest recommendation. Viewers can watch Sean's 27 videos and

575
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:32,320
ATV episodes on Closer to Truth, and over 1,500 videos on cosmology and physics,

576
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,760
especially their meaning and implications, not all of which Sean would agree with.

00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,520
