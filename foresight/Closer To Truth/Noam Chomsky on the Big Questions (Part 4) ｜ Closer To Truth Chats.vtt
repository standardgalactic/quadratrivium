WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.840
of the ape was able to do things that made them think,

00:04.840 --> 00:07.720
oh, he's asking for a banana.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.120
But when they looked at it closely,

00:10.120 --> 00:12.200
the nymph was just producing signs

00:12.200 --> 00:14.840
which somehow got him what he wanted sometimes.

00:23.840 --> 00:26.680
Welcome to Closer to Truth Chats.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.640
Today I'm speaking with Noam Chomsky,

00:29.640 --> 00:31.840
the distinguished theoretical linguist,

00:31.840 --> 00:34.480
analytic philosopher, cognitive scientist,

00:34.480 --> 00:36.320
and public intellectual.

00:36.320 --> 00:39.200
He is Institute Professor Emeritus at MIT

00:39.200 --> 00:41.400
and Laureate Professor of Linguistics

00:41.400 --> 00:43.480
at the University of Arizona.

00:43.480 --> 00:46.960
Closer to Truth is presenting this four-part mini series

00:46.960 --> 00:48.680
with Professor Chomsky.

00:48.680 --> 00:52.480
Part four now covers applications of Chomsky's

00:52.480 --> 00:55.560
linguistic theories to other fields and issues

00:55.560 --> 00:58.120
and his thoughts, opinions, reflections

00:58.120 --> 01:01.360
on Closer to Truth themes and big questions.

01:01.360 --> 01:04.600
So Noam, let's begin with an overview of what

01:04.600 --> 01:06.160
has been called, what you've been called,

01:06.160 --> 01:08.280
the basic property of language.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.720
And it's three parts that you've

01:10.720 --> 01:14.440
talked about, the internal computational system that

01:14.440 --> 01:17.840
has hierarchically structured, the sensory motor system

01:17.840 --> 01:20.480
that expresses through externalization, speaking,

01:20.480 --> 01:24.600
et cetera, and then this internal conception system

01:24.600 --> 01:28.160
for inference, interpretation planning, what

01:28.160 --> 01:31.200
is we informally call thought.

01:31.200 --> 01:36.120
So just want to get your sense of this big picture of language.

01:36.120 --> 01:40.360
If you take a look at the human species,

01:40.360 --> 01:47.520
what sharply differentiates it from any organic species

01:47.520 --> 01:52.520
we know of are two things, possession of language,

01:52.520 --> 01:55.880
possession of thought in any form

01:55.880 --> 01:59.760
that we can grasp what thought is.

01:59.760 --> 02:04.840
I have two identifying features of a species.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.400
First question that comes to mind

02:07.400 --> 02:10.080
is what's their relation?

02:10.080 --> 02:13.840
Simplest relation would be identity.

02:13.840 --> 02:17.880
And in fact, that's a fair statement.

02:17.920 --> 02:22.960
It's been understood through history for millennia actually

02:22.960 --> 02:27.760
that language and thought are intimately related.

02:27.760 --> 02:32.400
Language has historically been called audible thought.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.960
It's the mechanism for constructing

02:35.960 --> 02:40.240
thoughts over an infinite range which we then

02:40.240 --> 02:44.560
can access and use in our various activities.

02:44.600 --> 02:49.680
The internal nature of until the 20th century

02:49.680 --> 02:54.480
when mathematical theories of computation

02:54.480 --> 02:58.560
were developed clearly and precisely,

02:58.560 --> 03:04.480
it was very difficult to capture the essence of this system.

03:04.480 --> 03:07.800
The last 70 years, we've been able to do it.

03:07.800 --> 03:11.840
What we need, what is somehow coded in our brains

03:11.840 --> 03:18.560
is a finite procedure, kind of like a program in your laptop,

03:18.560 --> 03:21.640
a finite procedure which generates

03:21.640 --> 03:27.200
an infinite number of hierarchically structured

03:27.200 --> 03:32.880
expressions, each of which is an expression of thought

03:32.880 --> 03:40.080
and which can be externalized into some sensory motor medium.

03:40.120 --> 03:46.160
Usually sound could be sign, could even be touch,

03:46.160 --> 03:48.160
sound is the usual one.

03:48.160 --> 03:52.200
That seems to be the basic character of language.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.640
It's not quite the instrument of thought.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.360
It is thought.

03:58.360 --> 04:02.360
We have thought insofar as we have language.

04:02.360 --> 04:05.840
In any significant sense of thought,

04:05.840 --> 04:08.440
there are a couple of dogs at my feet

04:08.440 --> 04:14.640
and they have a kind of thought, but it's finite bounded.

04:14.640 --> 04:17.200
If I say a couple of certain words,

04:17.200 --> 04:22.280
I can say which I won't say and they'll be running to the door.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.800
It's a sort of thought, but it's not what we're doing now

04:25.800 --> 04:30.280
or what humans do normally, constructing modes,

04:30.280 --> 04:36.560
expressions that can be used for reflection, analysis,

04:36.560 --> 04:42.760
planning, inference, all the things that our minds uniquely do.

04:42.760 --> 04:47.520
They basically do with language or with instructions

04:47.520 --> 04:52.040
that language provides to other cognitive systems,

04:52.040 --> 04:57.760
just as the internal language that we have

04:57.760 --> 05:03.000
provides instructions to the articulatory system, which

05:03.000 --> 05:06.960
we can then pick up and use to pronounce things.

05:06.960 --> 05:12.080
Sort of similar on the side of conceptual analysis,

05:12.080 --> 05:14.680
reflection, thought generally.

05:14.680 --> 05:17.520
That seems to be the general picture.

05:17.520 --> 05:22.960
So if this basic property is really basic,

05:22.960 --> 05:26.040
where and when did it first appear?

05:26.040 --> 05:29.960
I think you've written so much, I'm not sure when this occurred,

05:29.960 --> 05:33.680
but you've said that the origin of mind-dependent,

05:33.680 --> 05:37.240
word-like elements remains a mystery.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.800
Other people don't think it's a mystery,

05:38.800 --> 05:41.200
but you still think it's a mystery?

05:41.200 --> 05:42.640
Total mystery.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.320
We have no idea.

05:45.320 --> 05:47.760
But we know a lot about it.

05:47.760 --> 05:52.880
So for example, Lyleg Leitman's work

05:52.880 --> 05:58.240
died recently, an outstanding cognitive psychologist

05:58.240 --> 05:59.760
and linguist.

05:59.760 --> 06:07.400
She, her work showed that a child of maybe two or three

06:07.400 --> 06:11.080
has an enormous knowledge of language

06:11.080 --> 06:14.000
well beyond anything it can express,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.680
and particularly with regard to words.

06:16.680 --> 06:20.800
Children pick up words at a fantastic rate.

06:20.800 --> 06:25.920
At that age, they may be picking up one word every waking hour,

06:25.960 --> 06:30.320
pick up on very few presentations, no training,

06:30.320 --> 06:32.880
nothing like that, very little evidence.

06:32.880 --> 06:37.960
And they know the words and all of their richness and complexity.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.920
Then comes the second part, investigating

06:40.920 --> 06:42.880
the character of the words.

06:42.880 --> 06:46.800
And it turns out even the simplest ones, the ones we use

06:46.800 --> 06:50.000
to refer to the things around us,

06:50.000 --> 06:53.680
have rich, complex, internal structure.

06:53.720 --> 06:56.640
So there's a question, two questions.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.960
One, a question of acquisition.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.200
One, a question of evolution.

07:01.200 --> 07:05.160
Question of acquisition is how infants

07:05.160 --> 07:10.280
are able to hit upon the rich, complex notions

07:10.280 --> 07:13.600
that they have mastered at a very early age

07:13.600 --> 07:15.480
with very little data.

07:15.480 --> 07:16.960
One question.

07:16.960 --> 07:22.440
The other question is, where in human evolution did this arise?

07:22.440 --> 07:27.120
Well, my own feeling for a long time

07:27.120 --> 07:33.840
was that this was lost in the midst of pre-human history.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.840
I think now that that's mistaken.

07:36.840 --> 07:40.720
If these complex concepts, even notice

07:40.720 --> 07:48.360
that even the simplest concepts, tree, desk, person, dog,

07:48.360 --> 07:51.920
whatever you want, even these are extremely complex

07:51.920 --> 07:53.800
in their internal structure.

07:53.800 --> 07:59.960
If such concepts had developed in proto-human history

07:59.960 --> 08:04.080
when there was no language, they would have been useless.

08:04.080 --> 08:08.720
They would have been an accident if they developed,

08:08.720 --> 08:11.560
and they would quickly have been lost because you

08:11.560 --> 08:13.720
can't do anything with them.

08:13.720 --> 08:18.160
So chances are very strong that the concepts developed

08:18.160 --> 08:21.840
within human history at a point where

08:21.840 --> 08:28.200
we had computational systems which satisfy the basic property,

08:28.200 --> 08:31.680
well, that reduces the mystery somewhat.

08:31.680 --> 08:37.720
It means it was within the last couple hundred thousand years,

08:37.720 --> 08:42.360
which is a blink of an eye in evolutionary time.

08:42.360 --> 08:46.120
Anthropological research has succeeded

08:46.120 --> 08:50.640
in giving a fair amount of information

08:50.640 --> 08:55.960
about up to 20,000 or 30,000 years ago

08:55.960 --> 08:59.240
how indigenous cultures, they were quite rich,

08:59.240 --> 09:03.680
indigenous cultures developed and operated.

09:03.680 --> 09:08.160
So this kind of narrowed the time window

09:08.160 --> 09:14.440
in which this evolution presumably took place.

09:14.440 --> 09:19.760
That doesn't solve the problem, but it makes it a little more feasible.

09:19.760 --> 09:25.880
It's during this era that we do begin to get complex, symbolic behavior,

09:25.880 --> 09:31.600
fantastic artwork, evidence of complex societies,

09:31.600 --> 09:36.120
and so on, roughly in this period about 100,000 years.

09:36.120 --> 09:42.760
Would you use the term human to whatever primates were prior

09:42.760 --> 09:48.160
to that language explosion or that language event?

09:48.160 --> 09:50.760
Well, these are just technical usages.

09:50.760 --> 09:56.440
Those are hominids, hominids, homo sapiens,

09:56.440 --> 10:00.160
especially our species, separate species.

10:00.160 --> 10:06.360
Its origins seem to be in the order of two to 300,000 years ago.

10:06.360 --> 10:11.120
Co-terminal with language?

10:11.120 --> 10:14.720
Well, that we don't know, but there's evidence.

10:14.720 --> 10:18.600
Prior to the appearance of homo sapiens,

10:18.600 --> 10:22.520
there's no evidence in the archeological record

10:22.520 --> 10:26.720
for any significant symbolic behavior,

10:26.720 --> 10:32.840
maybe a mark on a stone or something.

10:32.840 --> 10:38.040
The kind of complex behavior that seems to require language

10:38.040 --> 10:44.240
doesn't appear before homo sapiens, so that it puts one kind of bound.

10:44.240 --> 10:46.920
We have another firmer bound.

10:46.920 --> 10:53.120
Genomic analysis has now placed the separation of humans

10:53.120 --> 10:57.400
at about at least 150,000 years ago.

10:57.400 --> 11:01.000
So we're now down to a very brief period,

11:01.000 --> 11:06.520
and all known humans have the same language faculty.

11:06.520 --> 11:13.720
So it seems clear that the language faculty existed

11:13.720 --> 11:17.880
before the early separation of humans,

11:17.880 --> 11:20.280
which leaves a very small window.

11:20.280 --> 11:24.800
It means something pretty simple must have happened.

11:24.800 --> 11:30.280
50,000 years sounds like a large number, but not in evolutionary time.

11:30.280 --> 11:32.840
In terms of the purpose of language,

11:32.880 --> 11:36.240
it's generally assumed by evolutionary biologists

11:36.240 --> 11:40.480
that communications is the primary purpose,

11:40.480 --> 11:44.640
the driver of it, with analogs from animal communications,

11:44.640 --> 11:51.480
whether bird songs or monkey calls that that evolved into human language.

11:51.480 --> 11:54.200
I think you've taken quite the opposite position,

11:54.200 --> 11:57.160
which is not unusual for you to take opposite positions,

11:57.160 --> 12:03.440
that language is more an inner mental tool as its driver,

12:03.440 --> 12:11.000
or as what it was, as opposed to a linear evolution of communications capabilities.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.640
Well, let me first step back a step.

12:15.640 --> 12:22.520
Talking about the purpose of a biological system is not really appropriate.

12:22.520 --> 12:25.800
Biological systems don't have purposes.

12:25.800 --> 12:30.760
They appear, then maybe they're put to use in one or another way.

12:30.760 --> 12:35.800
But if you look at the process of evolution, it really has three stages.

12:35.800 --> 12:41.280
The first stage is something disrupts the existing system,

12:41.280 --> 12:47.000
maybe a mutation, maybe symbiosis.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.120
So, sometime a couple billion years ago,

12:53.120 --> 13:00.120
a billion years ago, a bacterium swallowed another microorganism

13:00.120 --> 13:03.920
that led to a disruption of the system.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.680
It's the beginning of eukaryotic cells.

13:06.680 --> 13:09.920
The basis for complex life was an accident.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.720
Well, first the system gets disrupted.

13:12.800 --> 13:16.360
Then the second stage, nature,

13:16.360 --> 13:21.120
tries to form the simplest, most elegant solution

13:21.120 --> 13:23.960
to how to deal with this new phenomenon.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.960
That's the second stage.

13:25.960 --> 13:32.680
The third stage is winnowing of the various things that are around,

13:32.680 --> 13:39.880
which ones are going to have higher reproductive success, natural selection.

13:39.880 --> 13:43.120
Let me take a look at the language.

13:43.120 --> 13:48.080
The initial stage, some stage of disruption,

13:48.080 --> 13:53.160
evidently produced a recursive function,

13:53.160 --> 13:57.160
a computational procedure that goes on,

13:57.160 --> 14:00.960
that can be coded on a computer effectively.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.880
It's basically what a recursive function is.

14:03.880 --> 14:07.280
So, the first stage that appeared somehow,

14:07.280 --> 14:11.040
presumably some small rewiring of the brain,

14:11.040 --> 14:13.840
led to the appearance of this.

14:13.840 --> 14:20.360
Second stage, nature formed the best possible solution

14:20.360 --> 14:24.120
to how to incorporate this into the brain.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.600
Well, the goal of contemporary linguistics

14:27.600 --> 14:30.520
is to find out what that system is.

14:30.520 --> 14:33.080
But what about the winnowing stage?

14:33.080 --> 14:35.480
That never came for language.

14:35.480 --> 14:38.240
There never was any choice.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.920
Partly maybe because there just wasn't enough time,

14:41.920 --> 14:45.160
but partly for, probably for a deeper reason.

14:45.160 --> 14:51.680
When you look into this system that nature constructed in detail,

14:51.680 --> 14:55.680
you find that it's so tightly integrated,

14:55.680 --> 14:58.480
so elegantly put together,

14:58.480 --> 15:02.960
that any modification of it in the whole system collapses.

15:02.960 --> 15:05.760
So, there was just no way to select.

15:05.760 --> 15:09.600
It looks as if selection just didn't operate for language.

15:09.600 --> 15:13.640
At least the core parts of it, it certainly may operate

15:13.640 --> 15:15.520
for peripheral parts.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.240
Now, if we look back at the,

15:18.240 --> 15:22.960
so I think we can't really talk about the purpose of the system.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.400
We can talk about how it's used.

15:25.400 --> 15:29.240
Okay, now if you take a look at how language is used,

15:29.240 --> 15:31.640
sometimes it's used for communication,

15:31.680 --> 15:33.960
like you and I are doing,

15:33.960 --> 15:36.960
but that actually is a very peripheral use.

15:36.960 --> 15:41.240
Almost all of our use of language goes on.

15:41.240 --> 15:45.560
All of our waking hours, most of our sleeping hours,

15:45.560 --> 15:47.680
is just thinking.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.920
We just can't stop, almost impossible to stop.

15:50.920 --> 15:55.240
It takes a tremendous act of will to stop thinking.

15:55.240 --> 15:58.240
That's our overwhelming use of language.

15:58.360 --> 16:01.600
We don't know, we only know what's going on there

16:01.600 --> 16:03.320
from the outside.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.680
We can't introspect into it.

16:05.680 --> 16:09.880
What we call inner speech is not inner speech.

16:09.880 --> 16:12.520
It's externalized speech,

16:12.520 --> 16:16.200
where the articulatories have been put on hold.

16:17.800 --> 16:18.920
What's actually going on,

16:18.920 --> 16:20.920
we can only discover the way you discover

16:20.920 --> 16:24.560
how the visual system works from the outside.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.200
And that's basically what linguistics is about.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.280
At least the kind that interests me.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.920
Try to find out what this system is

16:32.920 --> 16:35.320
that Mother Nature put together

16:35.320 --> 16:37.720
that is used entirely for thought.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.920
Now there are other reasons for thinking

16:39.920 --> 16:44.600
that communication is a peripheral use of language.

16:44.600 --> 16:48.320
When you look at the nature of this internal system,

16:48.320 --> 16:51.600
you find that there are conflicts

16:51.600 --> 16:56.680
between computational efficiency

16:56.760 --> 16:58.800
and communicative efficiency.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.680
And in every single case,

17:02.680 --> 17:06.000
communicative efficiency is sacrificed

17:06.000 --> 17:09.280
as if nature just didn't care.

17:09.280 --> 17:12.720
It only cared about computational efficiency,

17:12.720 --> 17:16.560
constructing a beautiful internal system,

17:16.560 --> 17:19.720
which is typically the way evolution works.

17:19.720 --> 17:23.000
That's how evolution generally works

17:23.000 --> 17:24.880
for perfectly good reasons.

17:24.880 --> 17:28.240
During the second stage of reconstruction,

17:28.240 --> 17:30.440
nature can't have any idea

17:30.440 --> 17:32.840
how the organism's gonna put it to use

17:32.840 --> 17:34.880
to take a ridiculous example

17:34.880 --> 17:38.680
when nature was designing human beings.

17:38.680 --> 17:42.560
It didn't design ears so that they could keep masks.

17:44.320 --> 17:45.800
Just didn't care.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.080
And it probably didn't care

17:47.080 --> 17:50.200
that humans could use language for communication.

17:50.200 --> 17:53.640
That's the way things seem to be developing.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.240
There is actually no,

17:55.240 --> 17:57.880
the only reason to believe that language

17:57.880 --> 17:59.320
is used for communication,

17:59.320 --> 18:02.040
which is a modern idea incidentally,

18:02.040 --> 18:05.600
is misinterpretations of evolution.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.600
It somehow must have developed,

18:07.600 --> 18:10.840
you language must develop out of animal systems,

18:10.840 --> 18:12.560
communication systems.

18:12.560 --> 18:14.920
I believe no reason to believe that.

18:14.920 --> 18:15.760
None.

18:15.760 --> 18:19.080
And the evidence is overwhelmingly that it didn't.

18:19.080 --> 18:23.560
There's nothing similar to the basic elements

18:23.560 --> 18:26.480
of language, either the conceptual elements

18:26.480 --> 18:28.920
or the computational ones.

18:28.920 --> 18:31.800
Nothing similar in the animal world.

18:31.800 --> 18:35.640
Animal communication differs from human use of language

18:35.640 --> 18:37.960
in radical ways.

18:37.960 --> 18:41.160
And if the course of evolution was,

18:41.160 --> 18:45.120
as I recently suggested a few moments ago,

18:45.120 --> 18:46.440
it's not gonna have any connection

18:46.440 --> 18:47.880
with animal communication.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.520
Now there, I should say that,

18:51.520 --> 18:54.800
there's a kind of a baby talk Darwinism,

18:54.800 --> 18:57.480
which isn't evolutionary theory

18:57.480 --> 19:00.040
that holds that any complex system

19:00.040 --> 19:04.320
must have developed in very small steps from earlier ones.

19:04.320 --> 19:07.240
Actually Darwin himself believed that,

19:07.240 --> 19:10.240
but that's been shown to be untrue.

19:10.240 --> 19:15.240
There are many sharp changes in evolutionary history

19:15.480 --> 19:18.960
from disruptions of one kind or another,

19:18.960 --> 19:22.440
like eukaryotic cells or mutations and so on,

19:22.440 --> 19:24.080
and many other things.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.880
So are we saying that those who claim that language

19:27.880 --> 19:31.560
is the result of a transformation

19:31.560 --> 19:35.120
of animal language, animal communication?

19:35.120 --> 19:40.120
But does that mean that they are bringing to the question,

19:40.320 --> 19:43.400
what I can only call an ideological bias

19:43.440 --> 19:48.440
that language has to be the small increment development

19:48.840 --> 19:53.840
of what looks similar in previous animals?

19:55.760 --> 19:58.360
First of all, it doesn't look similar.

19:58.360 --> 20:01.080
It looks radically different.

20:01.080 --> 20:06.080
The most elementary features of language

20:06.240 --> 20:10.440
have no analog whatsoever in the animal world.

20:11.440 --> 20:14.680
And remember, our closest relatives,

20:14.680 --> 20:18.680
the higher apes are actually about 12 million years

20:18.680 --> 20:21.360
separate from us in evolutionary time.

20:22.440 --> 20:25.120
So throughout this, they've evolved.

20:25.120 --> 20:29.040
Our common ancestors about six million years ago,

20:29.040 --> 20:31.840
they've evolved, we've evolved.

20:31.840 --> 20:36.680
It's impossible to teach with most intensive efforts.

20:37.200 --> 20:42.200
Impossible to teach the most elementary mimicry of language,

20:43.720 --> 20:45.440
even to higher apes.

20:45.440 --> 20:48.760
Every effort that's been tried has been a total failure.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.920
It's just a common myth.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.760
There's no evidence for it.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.160
What about, I mean, there are claims

20:56.160 --> 20:59.680
that animals of parrots and chimps

20:59.680 --> 21:04.680
have a rudimentary number of words they understand.

21:06.880 --> 21:10.360
You know, your namesake, Nym Chomsky, if I...

21:10.360 --> 21:15.360
Nym Chomsky, how do you interpret that?

21:15.360 --> 21:19.160
It's also true of my dogs, they do better.

21:19.160 --> 21:22.800
The Nym project was a very interesting project.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.200
Very fine scientists involved,

21:25.200 --> 21:29.440
number of them, close friends, former students even.

21:29.440 --> 21:34.440
They tried very hard to raise a chimp from infancy

21:35.440 --> 21:37.800
about the way a human child is raised,

21:37.800 --> 21:40.120
as close to it as they could come.

21:40.120 --> 21:43.000
They worked very hard, very seriously.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.120
For a long time, they thought they were making progress.

21:47.120 --> 21:50.280
Later, when they reviewed their evidence,

21:50.280 --> 21:51.800
they were very careful.

21:51.800 --> 21:55.240
They had a video record of everything that happened.

21:55.240 --> 21:59.040
When that was analyzed, it turned out that it was zero.

22:00.040 --> 22:04.040
The ape was able to do things that made them think.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.760
Oh, he's asking for a banana.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.120
But when they looked at it closely,

22:10.120 --> 22:15.120
turned out that the ape was making random signs.

22:15.480 --> 22:18.400
Maybe banana was in there,

22:18.400 --> 22:22.000
want was in the, a bunch of other things were there,

22:22.000 --> 22:26.120
but the investigators were interpreting it

22:26.120 --> 22:28.480
as Nym wants a banana.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.560
Nym was just producing signs,

22:30.560 --> 22:33.840
which somehow got him what he wanted sometimes.

22:33.920 --> 22:38.080
In fact, it turned out that even the most elementary concept

22:38.080 --> 22:43.080
of an object was Nym could never learn.

22:43.360 --> 22:48.360
He had a symbol for apple, but for Nym, it meant an apple,

22:49.440 --> 22:51.360
the place where an apple was,

22:51.360 --> 22:54.160
something was near the apple,

22:54.160 --> 22:56.480
anything associated with apple,

22:56.480 --> 22:58.680
concept apple was impossible.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.440
So, and this has been true.

23:01.440 --> 23:06.400
There are a lot of claims about animal achievements,

23:06.400 --> 23:10.080
but where investigators have been willing

23:10.080 --> 23:15.080
to provide actual data, primary data,

23:15.720 --> 23:17.720
there's nothing that you can't find anything,

23:17.720 --> 23:19.960
which is not very surprising.

23:19.960 --> 23:23.600
It wouldn't be easy to teach us to behave like apes,

23:24.520 --> 23:26.280
which is not ready to build for it.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.600
We didn't evolve to it.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.640
I know some people that would be probably pretty easy

23:30.680 --> 23:32.520
to teach them how to behave like apes,

23:32.520 --> 23:37.520
but that may be just a commentary on my friends.

23:39.160 --> 23:44.160
Nym, you have brought into scientific thinking

23:44.280 --> 23:46.400
the concept of deep structure.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.600
I know that affected me many decades ago,

23:49.600 --> 23:51.920
and I started thinking intellectually about the brain

23:51.920 --> 23:54.640
and about the way everything is structured

23:54.640 --> 23:57.000
and the concept of deep structure

23:57.000 --> 23:59.840
you have embedded in intellectual content.

23:59.840 --> 24:02.080
Now, you later modified that in terms of language,

24:02.080 --> 24:03.360
in terms of minimalism.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.040
We talked about that in the earlier parts,

24:05.040 --> 24:08.360
but what I'd like you to do is just reflect

24:08.360 --> 24:13.000
on the power of the deep structure paradigm

24:13.000 --> 24:17.320
in many diverse fields from architecture, music, politics,

24:17.320 --> 24:19.960
which I know you've had some association with,

24:19.960 --> 24:21.920
certainly cognitive science,

24:21.920 --> 24:24.920
this way of thinking of deep structure.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.080
Just want to get your sense of it.

24:27.080 --> 24:32.080
It's a concept that is ubiquitous in the sciences.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.800
So if you look at a,

24:35.800 --> 24:38.520
suppose I drink a glass of water,

24:38.520 --> 24:43.520
well, I have no idea what the components of it are.

24:45.400 --> 24:49.000
There is an internal underlying structure.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.400
There's hydrogen atoms, oxygen atoms,

24:52.400 --> 24:54.200
lots of other things,

24:54.200 --> 24:57.360
all put together in a complex form

24:57.360 --> 25:00.280
with an underlying rich structure,

25:00.280 --> 25:02.880
which I don't see.

25:02.880 --> 25:04.720
You have to do complex.

25:04.720 --> 25:08.480
It took centuries of serious investigation

25:08.480 --> 25:11.600
to discover what the internal structure

25:11.600 --> 25:14.520
of a water molecule is, okay?

25:14.520 --> 25:16.240
That's deep structure.

25:16.240 --> 25:19.840
All over, we don't see the nature of things.

25:19.840 --> 25:24.320
We see peripheral superficial aspects of them.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.040
Language is the same.

25:26.040 --> 25:29.060
We don't see its internal nature.

25:29.060 --> 25:32.120
We see superficial aspects.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.900
And deep structure happened to be a technical notion

25:35.900 --> 25:37.920
which had a specific meaning,

25:37.920 --> 25:42.920
but the general idea that there is a hidden inner form,

25:43.560 --> 25:47.200
internal structure, not visible to us,

25:47.200 --> 25:49.960
but only can be discovered

25:49.960 --> 25:53.520
through intensive inquiry and investigation.

25:53.520 --> 25:56.640
That's a ubiquitous concept.

25:56.640 --> 25:58.960
And it was understood in the study of language

25:58.960 --> 26:02.840
in the 17th and 18th century.

26:02.840 --> 26:04.000
It was forgotten.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.360
But if you go back to the origins

26:06.360 --> 26:08.920
of the scientific revolution,

26:08.920 --> 26:13.080
Galileo or no, Descartes, others,

26:13.120 --> 26:17.520
they recognized that there's a inner form to language

26:17.520 --> 26:19.080
that we don't see.

26:19.080 --> 26:22.880
Famous Fort Royal Grammar, 1660.

26:22.880 --> 26:23.920
I don't know.

26:23.920 --> 26:28.920
Others, it had something comparable to deep structure.

26:29.160 --> 26:30.560
They didn't call it that.

26:30.560 --> 26:33.400
And they didn't have the means at the time

26:33.400 --> 26:37.160
to develop a computational theory that came later.

26:37.160 --> 26:41.320
For example, one of the examples in the Fort Royal Grammar

26:41.960 --> 26:46.960
is the sentence, invisible God created the visible world.

26:47.800 --> 26:52.800
And they argue that underlying this are three propositions.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.080
God is invisible.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.560
The world is visible.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.480
God created the world.

27:00.480 --> 27:05.480
And some kind of operations turned these internal propositions

27:05.480 --> 27:08.960
into invisible God created the visible world.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.960
It's pretty similar to deep structure.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.440
That's a great example.

27:14.480 --> 27:19.160
The cognitive science revolution transformed,

27:19.160 --> 27:20.720
really it's transformed our lives.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.280
It certainly transformed understanding

27:23.280 --> 27:25.480
how we think in the human sciences

27:25.480 --> 27:27.120
and of course all the computer sciences,

27:27.120 --> 27:30.760
your work in linguistics is given credit

27:30.760 --> 27:35.040
for at least in part, triggering that revolution.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.800
Why is that the case?

27:36.800 --> 27:40.640
Well, first of all, I hate to be a contrarian all the time,

27:40.640 --> 27:44.880
but my own view is that the real cognitive revolution

27:44.880 --> 27:47.480
took place in the 17th century,

27:47.480 --> 27:50.200
along with the rise of modern science.

27:50.200 --> 27:53.880
It's been mostly forgotten, but there were real achievements.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.680
Started mentioning some, there are many others.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.040
I've done a fair amount of work on that.

27:59.040 --> 28:03.120
The second cognitive revolution in the 1950s,

28:03.120 --> 28:07.280
developed mainly in Cambridge mass

28:07.280 --> 28:10.620
where I happened to be a grad student at the time.

28:11.340 --> 28:15.020
If you look at what constituted it,

28:15.020 --> 28:18.860
there were basically two things.

28:18.860 --> 28:23.060
Jerry Fodor, late friend, important cognitive science

28:23.060 --> 28:27.540
and philosopher, at once quipped that cognitive science

28:27.540 --> 28:32.540
is the study of language and vision, not totally false.

28:32.860 --> 28:35.380
Those are the fields that really developed

28:35.380 --> 28:39.180
a lot of rich investigation of how visual perception

28:39.220 --> 28:43.900
takes place, a lot of study of the nature of language.

28:43.900 --> 28:46.780
And it was all integrated, we all know each other.

28:46.780 --> 28:51.820
So Dave Maher is one of the founders of modern visual

28:51.820 --> 28:55.420
science, we were friends and some of his work

28:55.420 --> 28:58.100
was kind of modeled on some of the things

28:58.100 --> 28:59.980
that were being done in language,

28:59.980 --> 29:03.980
but a lot of integration.

29:03.980 --> 29:08.220
So it's kind of understandable.

29:08.220 --> 29:13.140
These are two topics that you sort of know how to study.

29:13.140 --> 29:16.020
Other things are very hard to study,

29:16.020 --> 29:19.100
like for example, the nature of concepts.

29:19.100 --> 29:22.260
That's a tough one to try to figure out,

29:22.260 --> 29:24.540
what is the nature of the concept,

29:24.540 --> 29:28.820
tree, river, house, and so on.

29:28.820 --> 29:33.580
Actually here the classical Greece had some answers,

29:33.580 --> 29:35.300
which have been forgotten.

29:35.300 --> 29:39.540
So Aristotle considered this question

29:39.540 --> 29:43.620
in a different framework and his framework was metaphysical.

29:43.620 --> 29:47.820
So not what's the meaning of house, but what is a house?

29:47.820 --> 29:50.660
It was the cognitive revolution of the 17th century

29:50.660 --> 29:53.500
that shifted that from metaphysics

29:53.500 --> 29:56.980
to epistemology to cognition.

29:56.980 --> 30:01.980
But in forgetting that Aristotle asks, what's a house?

30:01.980 --> 30:06.900
He says it's a combination of matter and form.

30:06.900 --> 30:11.700
The matter is the bricks, the timbers, and so on.

30:11.700 --> 30:17.260
The form is the design, characteristic use,

30:17.260 --> 30:21.580
the intention of the architect, all sorts of mental things.

30:21.580 --> 30:23.020
And that's quite correct.

30:23.020 --> 30:27.460
Something could look like a house, but not be a house at all.

30:27.460 --> 30:30.580
It's used to store books, it's a library.

30:30.580 --> 30:34.980
It's used to put courses in, it's a stable.

30:34.980 --> 30:38.500
Could be a paperweight for a giant.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.580
What it actually is, you can't tell,

30:40.580 --> 30:42.740
but it's physical character.

30:42.740 --> 30:46.140
I think all the terms that are used for us

30:46.140 --> 30:50.020
when we talk about the world have that character.

30:50.020 --> 30:55.500
What the thing is, is largely a mental construction.

30:55.500 --> 31:00.340
And that brings us back to why the Gleitmann's crucial work.

31:00.340 --> 31:04.900
All of these concepts must be basically innate,

31:04.900 --> 31:08.420
or at least they're the elements that constitute them

31:08.420 --> 31:11.940
must be innate, because a child acquires them

31:11.940 --> 31:14.500
on virtually no evidence.

31:14.500 --> 31:18.100
Actually, one of Leila's favorite examples

31:18.100 --> 31:24.300
was a young child very early, says things like,

31:24.300 --> 31:25.940
that's not fair.

31:25.940 --> 31:28.500
Try to analyze that.

31:28.500 --> 31:31.180
John Rawls has a huge book on it,

31:31.180 --> 31:33.700
the Foundation of Modern Political Science,

31:33.700 --> 31:35.620
just as his fairness.

31:35.620 --> 31:40.260
The concept fair is extremely complex to describe,

31:40.260 --> 31:43.380
but a young child has no trouble noticing

31:43.380 --> 31:46.740
that things aren't fair.

31:46.740 --> 31:48.660
Same with lots of other things.

31:48.660 --> 31:52.260
When people talk about the history of modern computer

31:52.260 --> 31:56.460
science, programming languages, compiler construction,

31:56.500 --> 32:01.380
or automata theory, many give your linguistic work credit

32:01.380 --> 32:06.380
for the conceptual ideas behind those concepts.

32:06.380 --> 32:09.500
What is it about your work in linguistics

32:09.500 --> 32:16.740
that has enabled programming to be as accurate as it is?

32:16.740 --> 32:17.860
I wouldn't.

32:17.860 --> 32:20.580
That's much too strong.

32:20.580 --> 32:24.420
I did work on finite automata theory, which

32:24.460 --> 32:29.660
had certain relationships to early programming languages.

32:29.660 --> 32:33.020
And there were neutral investigations,

32:33.020 --> 32:36.580
cooperative investigations, looking at these contexts.

32:36.580 --> 32:42.860
But it's basically forms of formal languages,

32:42.860 --> 32:47.220
properties somewhat similar to natural languages.

32:47.220 --> 32:52.500
I worked on them in the early 50s around the period

32:52.500 --> 32:55.500
that programming languages were being developed,

32:55.500 --> 32:59.380
and the two interact in a number of ways.

32:59.380 --> 33:03.380
So if you look at a textbook on programming,

33:03.380 --> 33:06.940
you'll find things about, sometimes called

33:06.940 --> 33:10.940
the Chomsky hierarchy, the hierarchy of possible formal

33:10.940 --> 33:16.900
languages, which have various analogs in programming theory.

33:16.900 --> 33:20.540
They capture some features of natural language,

33:20.540 --> 33:26.580
but they also correspond to certain types of automata,

33:26.580 --> 33:30.420
linear bounded automata, push down storage automata,

33:30.420 --> 33:35.260
standard interrelate with formal systems that

33:35.260 --> 33:38.100
capture some of the properties of language, which

33:38.100 --> 33:40.020
is a topic of some interest.

33:40.020 --> 33:45.460
But it didn't enable programming.

33:45.460 --> 33:50.380
I want to mention some theories of incognitive science

33:50.380 --> 33:53.500
and philosophy that you have attacked.

33:53.500 --> 33:56.620
I don't know of a softer word to accurately describe it,

33:56.620 --> 33:58.980
and want to just get your reflections on it.

33:58.980 --> 34:03.020
After many decades of looking back,

34:03.020 --> 34:05.820
first is behaviorism.

34:05.820 --> 34:10.580
What was it about behaviorism that you found erroneous,

34:10.580 --> 34:15.460
and how do you reflect now looking back over the decades?

34:15.460 --> 34:19.500
In my view, behaviorism was a radical departure

34:19.500 --> 34:20.900
from the sciences.

34:20.900 --> 34:23.260
First of all, behaviorism varied.

34:23.260 --> 34:27.180
But the form of behaviorism that was pretty much

34:27.180 --> 34:30.620
dominant in the period of creation

34:30.620 --> 34:33.900
of modern cognitive science was largely

34:33.900 --> 34:36.220
skinnerian behaviorism.

34:36.220 --> 34:40.100
It was picked up by Van Quine, one

34:40.100 --> 34:43.260
of the most influential philosophers of language.

34:44.020 --> 34:49.620
Work like Word and Object based very explicitly

34:49.620 --> 34:53.620
on operant conditioning, skinnerian behaviorism.

34:53.620 --> 34:57.220
And that was all the rage in Cambridge in the 1950s.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.860
It was virtual dogma.

34:59.860 --> 35:02.100
Skinners, William James Lectures,

35:02.100 --> 35:04.540
came out in the late 40s.

35:04.540 --> 35:06.460
The book itself, Herbal Behavior,

35:06.460 --> 35:08.340
came out about a decade later.

35:08.340 --> 35:11.340
But it was whatever it was doing.

35:11.380 --> 35:15.020
Well, there were various chips in the armor

35:15.020 --> 35:16.620
that began to develop.

35:16.620 --> 35:19.980
Some of them were within psychology itself.

35:19.980 --> 35:22.540
So George Miller, one of the founders

35:22.540 --> 35:26.260
of cognitive psychology, a close friend,

35:26.260 --> 35:28.060
worked closely with him for many years.

35:28.060 --> 35:29.980
We published together.

35:29.980 --> 35:35.460
Even before this started, he did some crucial experiments

35:35.460 --> 35:38.100
which raised serious questions.

35:38.140 --> 35:39.900
So for example, take the sentence,

35:39.900 --> 35:45.300
and John went to the store from any sentence.

35:45.300 --> 35:48.180
The standard theory of perception of speech

35:48.180 --> 35:53.260
was you have a certain guess about the first word,

35:53.260 --> 35:55.660
then you have a guess about the second word,

35:55.660 --> 35:58.460
the probability that you're right both times decreases,

35:58.460 --> 36:00.300
of course.

36:00.300 --> 36:02.660
By the time you get to the last word,

36:02.660 --> 36:05.980
it should be very hard to understand in a long sentence.

36:05.980 --> 36:08.820
Well, George showed that it's the opposite.

36:08.820 --> 36:11.060
You don't understand the early words

36:11.060 --> 36:13.620
until you get to the last word, which

36:13.620 --> 36:16.900
means that you're forming the thought in your mind.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.820
And the thought in your mind is telling you

36:18.820 --> 36:21.180
what those early noises were.

36:21.180 --> 36:23.700
By now, there's lots of work on this.

36:23.700 --> 36:27.180
Well, that just didn't fit at all with behaviorism.

36:27.180 --> 36:30.740
There was very important work in neuroscience

36:30.740 --> 36:36.660
by Carl Lashley, his work on serial behavior around 1950.

36:36.660 --> 36:39.500
It just totally undercut behaviorism,

36:39.500 --> 36:42.820
showed that there are overall patterns in behavior

36:42.820 --> 36:44.580
that simply just don't work anything

36:44.580 --> 36:47.180
like the waivers' models.

36:47.180 --> 36:50.020
Nobody looked at that.

36:50.020 --> 36:54.540
I found it in the early 50s because it was brought to my

36:54.540 --> 36:59.260
attention by an art historian, Harsh Piro,

37:00.060 --> 37:02.020
you might be interested in this.

37:02.020 --> 37:05.620
Looked at it, so totally wiped out behaviorism.

37:05.620 --> 37:10.260
There was other work going on in European, what's

37:10.260 --> 37:14.500
called ethology, comparative biology,

37:14.500 --> 37:18.860
the Lawrence, Timberg, and others,

37:18.860 --> 37:23.700
which was foreign to the environment in which cognitive

37:23.700 --> 37:26.180
science grew up.

37:26.180 --> 37:29.460
But the main thing was the work on language

37:29.460 --> 37:33.740
that I and others started doing in the early 50s

37:33.740 --> 37:39.100
was completely inconsistent with all behaviorist assumptions.

37:39.100 --> 37:43.860
And there was just no connection between them.

37:43.860 --> 37:45.780
You couldn't relate them.

37:45.780 --> 37:51.180
And then when Skinner's book appeared,

37:51.180 --> 37:53.220
you could read through it, and you

37:53.220 --> 37:56.980
could see that it's all hand-waving.

37:56.980 --> 37:59.060
There's nothing there.

37:59.060 --> 38:01.460
Incidentally, around that time, even

38:01.460 --> 38:05.380
within the behaviorist framework,

38:05.380 --> 38:07.820
there were cracks developing.

38:07.820 --> 38:11.100
So there was work by some of Skinner's students,

38:11.100 --> 38:13.660
incidentally important work, which

38:13.660 --> 38:16.420
showed that animals just didn't behave

38:16.420 --> 38:18.980
by these pattern paradigms.

38:18.980 --> 38:20.900
That they seemed to be working only

38:20.900 --> 38:25.940
if you picked experimental conditions that essentially

38:25.940 --> 38:28.980
adapted instinctive behavior.

38:28.980 --> 38:33.140
So you can teach a pigeon to play ping-pong

38:33.140 --> 38:36.420
because pigeons peck.

38:36.420 --> 38:39.140
So you can modify the pecking behavior.

38:39.140 --> 38:42.780
But basically, it was all falling apart from many points

38:42.780 --> 38:43.980
of view.

38:43.980 --> 38:48.220
And my own view, as it was a bad mistake from the first place,

38:48.220 --> 38:51.860
you don't study any subject by saying,

38:51.860 --> 38:55.180
let's keep to the superficial manifestations

38:55.180 --> 38:58.060
and not look at what's going on internally.

38:58.060 --> 38:59.420
You want to understand it?

38:59.420 --> 39:02.140
You're going to have to look at what's going on internally.

39:02.140 --> 39:03.740
You don't see it.

39:03.740 --> 39:06.260
You can't do experiments right on it.

39:06.260 --> 39:09.220
You have to study it in indirect ways,

39:09.220 --> 39:11.980
the way physics, chemistry, biology,

39:11.980 --> 39:13.980
every other subject developed.

39:13.980 --> 39:18.260
Linguistic relativity, the so-called Worf hypothesis,

39:18.260 --> 39:21.900
where language determines thought in the strong version

39:21.900 --> 39:24.620
or at least influences thought in the weak version,

39:24.620 --> 39:27.540
that the structure of a language affects the speaker's

39:27.540 --> 39:29.340
worldview or cognition.

39:29.340 --> 39:32.660
And therefore, when people have different languages,

39:32.660 --> 39:37.380
their perceptions are related to the languages they speak,

39:37.380 --> 39:43.220
as opposed to a broad human capability.

39:43.300 --> 39:47.860
That hypothesis, the superior Worf hypothesis,

39:47.860 --> 39:52.500
has been around for 80 or so years.

39:52.500 --> 39:55.220
Investigation of its series of investigation

39:55.220 --> 39:57.540
began in the early 50s.

39:57.540 --> 40:02.180
First person to study it was Eric Leneberg.

40:02.180 --> 40:05.020
We were grad students together, personal friend.

40:05.020 --> 40:07.860
He went on to found biology of language.

40:07.860 --> 40:10.220
But his first work was actually as a student

40:10.220 --> 40:15.500
on the Worf hypothesis, experimental work.

40:15.500 --> 40:16.780
Couldn't find anything.

40:16.780 --> 40:19.740
Everything you tried, you got some superficial results,

40:19.740 --> 40:20.980
but nothing.

40:20.980 --> 40:24.260
Well, it's now 75 years later.

40:24.260 --> 40:26.700
There isn't a lot more to say.

40:26.700 --> 40:30.140
There's some evidence.

40:30.140 --> 40:34.500
Some of the Lila Gleitman, who I mentioned before,

40:34.500 --> 40:39.020
carefully analyzed and did experimental work

40:39.020 --> 40:43.540
on some of the alleged evidence that fell apart.

40:43.540 --> 40:47.180
There's a few things around that seem possible,

40:47.180 --> 40:51.540
but pickings are very slim.

40:51.540 --> 40:54.220
I mean, there's some respects in which it's obviously true.

40:54.220 --> 41:00.340
So as Leneberg pointed out, 75 you found, 75 years ago,

41:00.340 --> 41:08.420
if you study a language that we have a distinction between red

41:08.420 --> 41:12.180
and orange and pink, say, but their languages don't.

41:12.180 --> 41:14.220
They haven't been studying Hopi.

41:14.220 --> 41:17.100
Just use the same word for that spectrum.

41:17.100 --> 41:20.220
So he found perfectly predictably

41:20.220 --> 41:24.820
that if you use, say, memory texts, tests,

41:24.820 --> 41:25.820
did you ever see that?

41:25.820 --> 41:30.540
Did you see this shade of color a minute ago?

41:30.540 --> 41:34.100
You'll do better if you have names.

41:34.100 --> 41:37.260
So in a way, the language affects perception,

41:37.260 --> 41:41.380
but in such a trivial way that it's of no interest.

41:41.380 --> 41:43.900
And there isn't much more than that.

41:43.900 --> 41:49.380
Logical positivism, which was the rage in the early 20th century

41:49.380 --> 41:52.780
that said that really there are only two kinds of truths

41:52.780 --> 41:57.900
and even only two kinds of intellectual activities

41:57.900 --> 42:00.580
worth pursuing, those that are empirical

42:00.580 --> 42:02.860
with a scientific method and those that are purely

42:02.860 --> 42:04.660
logical with a deduction.

42:04.700 --> 42:08.620
Everything else is basically non-stets.

42:08.620 --> 42:11.740
Well, logical positivism was an important movement

42:11.740 --> 42:16.620
in the 20s, early 30s.

42:16.620 --> 42:21.940
By the late 30s, its major figures

42:21.940 --> 42:25.100
were drifting away from it.

42:25.100 --> 42:32.420
Karnap, Temple, others, Quine, just moving away from it.

42:32.460 --> 42:37.900
And it became influential in linguistics and psychology

42:37.900 --> 42:43.220
after it was declining philosophy and declining

42:43.220 --> 42:44.140
for good reasons.

42:44.140 --> 42:46.580
There were internal critiques.

42:46.580 --> 42:49.820
But it did have a big influence on linguistics

42:49.820 --> 42:56.100
through Leonard Bloomfield, who saw himself as a strict.

42:56.100 --> 42:59.340
He was the major linguist in the early 20th century.

42:59.340 --> 43:02.420
He did very good work in many areas.

43:02.420 --> 43:05.940
But in this area, he was very much misled

43:05.940 --> 43:10.940
by picking up an early form of logical positivism, which

43:10.940 --> 43:12.660
was not viable.

43:12.660 --> 43:17.220
But so I think it's an important, made important contributions,

43:17.220 --> 43:22.100
important residue, developed sense in other directions.

43:22.100 --> 43:27.980
So if you look at Quine, Copper, Karnap, major figures,

43:28.580 --> 43:32.940
Wittgenstein was totally rejected.

43:32.940 --> 43:39.700
Then it just is no longer a coherent viable movement.

43:39.700 --> 43:42.660
What is your view of contemporary field

43:42.660 --> 43:47.380
or subfield of philosophy of language, which subsumes

43:47.380 --> 43:50.180
a great deal of what we're talking about and even more

43:50.180 --> 43:50.820
than that?

43:50.820 --> 43:51.980
What are the categories?

43:51.980 --> 43:53.540
What are your reflections on it?

43:53.540 --> 43:57.140
Well, I've been a pretty short critic of it.

43:57.140 --> 43:58.820
I've been book after book.

43:58.820 --> 44:00.940
I don't want to go through that.

44:00.940 --> 44:03.460
I mean, there is important work.

44:03.460 --> 44:07.460
But a lot of it, I think, is seriously misguided.

44:07.460 --> 44:11.180
I could go into details if written about it.

44:11.180 --> 44:13.220
So for example, take, say, Quine,

44:13.220 --> 44:16.140
who was the Quine and Wittgenstein

44:16.140 --> 44:21.100
to the leading figures of modern philosophy of language.

44:21.100 --> 44:24.900
Both of them accepted for Quine, who

44:24.900 --> 44:26.900
was a strict Schenarian.

44:26.900 --> 44:32.180
Language, in his words, is a complex of dispositions

44:32.180 --> 44:36.900
to respond to present stimuli.

44:36.900 --> 44:39.060
There's nothing to do with language.

44:39.060 --> 44:41.620
I mean, it didn't develop that way.

44:41.620 --> 44:43.740
It's not used that way.

44:43.740 --> 44:45.580
Wittgenstein, the late Wittgenstein,

44:45.580 --> 44:48.980
who was interested in language, it was kind of aphoristic.

44:48.980 --> 44:53.620
You know, try to give an organized system.

44:53.620 --> 44:58.020
But if you look at his comments on acquisition of language,

44:58.020 --> 45:01.540
they're strict behaviorist.

45:01.540 --> 45:05.140
You know, his language games, somebody

45:05.140 --> 45:10.780
is showing a rock and somebody says rock and imitated.

45:10.780 --> 45:12.780
That's how you learned rock.

45:12.780 --> 45:14.780
Nothing like that happens.

45:14.780 --> 45:17.820
I mean, there's tons of experimental evidence by now,

45:17.820 --> 45:20.580
even just observational evidence.

45:20.580 --> 45:25.940
And I think while there are doubtless major contributions,

45:25.940 --> 45:27.780
some of them, a lot of the work, I think,

45:27.780 --> 45:29.780
is off on the wrong track.

45:29.780 --> 45:34.020
So the main contributions, I think, have been in semantics.

45:34.020 --> 45:37.580
Donald Davidson's work on event semantics

45:37.580 --> 45:40.500
has turned out to be very productive and influential.

45:40.500 --> 45:46.220
It was picked up by Languist philosophers, James Higginbotham,

45:46.220 --> 45:50.660
Paul Trotsky, others, and it's turned into, my view,

45:50.660 --> 45:52.980
one of the most promising approaches

45:52.980 --> 45:55.940
to the general semantics of language.

45:55.940 --> 45:57.300
It's called philosophy.

45:57.300 --> 45:59.740
I don't know why it's called philosophy.

45:59.740 --> 46:03.060
It's basically a good, serious study

46:03.060 --> 46:05.580
of the semantics of natural language.

46:05.580 --> 46:08.660
Analytics philosophy versus continental philosophy.

46:08.660 --> 46:11.180
You're classified as an analytic philosopher.

46:11.180 --> 46:14.580
You've had some engagements with continental philosophers

46:14.580 --> 46:15.580
famously.

46:15.580 --> 46:19.540
What is your reflection on the dichotomy

46:19.540 --> 46:21.460
between them, the artificial?

46:24.820 --> 46:27.340
How do you see going forward?

46:27.340 --> 46:29.420
Well, actually, a good deal of my work

46:29.420 --> 46:35.020
is on continental philosophy from the 17th through the 19th

46:35.020 --> 46:49.500
century, Descartes, Hume, Locke, onto the philosophers

46:49.500 --> 46:53.980
of Humboldt on through the 19th century.

46:53.980 --> 46:59.500
Contemporary continental philosophy is quite different.

46:59.500 --> 47:03.420
There's work that I find interesting,

47:03.420 --> 47:06.220
close to a number of others.

47:06.220 --> 47:11.780
But most of the modern work, either I don't understand it

47:11.780 --> 47:15.700
or I don't find it very interesting.

47:15.700 --> 47:19.180
My own background is in what's called analytic philosophy,

47:19.180 --> 47:21.900
though I was, as I've just mentioned,

47:21.900 --> 47:25.740
I've been rather critical of a lot of the ways it's developed.

47:25.740 --> 47:31.540
But I think basically on the way to finding

47:31.540 --> 47:35.420
serious understanding of the way the mind works,

47:35.420 --> 47:36.980
the way the world works.

47:36.980 --> 47:38.980
What I'd like to do now, Nome, and I've really

47:38.980 --> 47:43.020
been looking forward to this, is to get your quick sense

47:43.020 --> 47:45.500
of some of the big questions that we

47:45.500 --> 47:48.580
ask on Close to the Truth, the themes that

47:48.580 --> 47:54.580
are the core of our work over two decades now.

47:54.580 --> 47:59.300
And we've asked these questions to all leading

47:59.300 --> 48:03.260
scientists, mainly physicists, philosophers,

48:03.260 --> 48:05.500
neuroscientists, et cetera, and just

48:05.500 --> 48:07.140
want to get your sense.

48:07.140 --> 48:10.580
So we'll start with philosophy of mind,

48:10.580 --> 48:12.300
which is a very broad category.

48:12.300 --> 48:13.900
But from your point of view, what

48:13.900 --> 48:16.740
have been the major issues or the problems

48:16.740 --> 48:19.540
in philosophy of mind, and where have you

48:19.540 --> 48:22.380
staked your own personal claims?

48:22.420 --> 48:25.500
I don't know how to distinguish philosophy of mind

48:25.500 --> 48:27.820
from science of mind.

48:27.820 --> 48:32.940
The science and philosophy were pretty much

48:32.940 --> 48:36.860
the same field until the 19th century.

48:36.860 --> 48:41.340
Then the names diverged, but not in a serious way.

48:41.340 --> 48:47.900
So the most serious work in cognitive science, in my view,

48:47.900 --> 48:51.980
is a development of a suggestion by clock John

48:51.980 --> 48:57.100
Locke in the wake of Isaac Newton's discoveries, who

48:57.100 --> 49:00.780
showed that the mechanical conception

49:00.780 --> 49:04.140
of the nature of the world that was developed in modern science

49:04.140 --> 49:05.540
just didn't work.

49:05.540 --> 49:10.940
So Locke concluded, he phrased it in his theological framework.

49:10.940 --> 49:12.260
I'll drop that.

49:12.260 --> 49:17.700
But just as the material world has properties

49:17.740 --> 49:20.860
that we cannot comprehend, but that

49:20.860 --> 49:26.340
are there like interaction without contact.

49:26.340 --> 49:32.100
So the mind might just be, let me take it in his theological

49:32.100 --> 49:36.620
framework, because it sounds better, just as God provided

49:36.620 --> 49:40.780
matter with properties that we cannot understand,

49:40.780 --> 49:43.460
like interaction without contact.

49:43.460 --> 49:47.620
So God might have super-added to matter

49:47.620 --> 49:51.140
the certain forms of matter the property of thought,

49:51.140 --> 49:55.780
meaning thought is a property of some organized form of matter,

49:55.780 --> 49:58.580
whatever matter turns out to be.

49:58.580 --> 50:00.940
That's a fundamental insight.

50:00.940 --> 50:05.140
And it was developed carefully through the 19th, 18th century

50:05.140 --> 50:06.340
by major figures.

50:06.340 --> 50:10.980
It culminated in Joseph Priestley's work.

50:10.980 --> 50:13.260
Famous chemist, philosopher, distinction

50:13.260 --> 50:15.660
wasn't made in those days.

50:15.660 --> 50:18.140
Then it was pretty much forgotten.

50:18.140 --> 50:21.700
It was rediscovered in the latter decades

50:21.700 --> 50:23.660
of the 20th century.

50:23.660 --> 50:28.780
It was then considered a radical new idea in philosophy,

50:28.780 --> 50:33.580
astonishing hypothesis, new thesis in biology.

50:33.580 --> 50:37.500
Actually Locke's suggestion on the work that was done on it.

50:37.540 --> 50:41.260
So that's a core part of philosophy of mine, I think,

50:41.260 --> 50:48.140
finding out what it is in the structure of the world,

50:48.140 --> 50:49.980
whatever the world is constituted of,

50:49.980 --> 50:52.220
that has this property of thought.

50:52.220 --> 50:55.220
Well, that's the kind of thing we were talking about before.

50:55.220 --> 50:57.540
And there are many mysteries there.

50:57.540 --> 51:00.340
One of them, by mystery, I mean things

51:00.340 --> 51:04.340
in which there's been no progress for millennia.

51:04.340 --> 51:06.100
One question is what we were talking

51:06.100 --> 51:09.420
about, the nature of concepts, where to come from,

51:09.420 --> 51:11.260
how to people acquire it.

51:11.260 --> 51:16.140
Another one is simply what was crucial for Descartes,

51:16.140 --> 51:19.780
the fact that our ordinary use of language

51:19.780 --> 51:22.420
is constantly innovative.

51:22.420 --> 51:26.460
New things that were never said before, they're not random.

51:26.460 --> 51:31.660
They're appropriate to situations, not caused by situations.

51:31.660 --> 51:35.220
I've called it the creative aspect of language use,

51:35.260 --> 51:38.660
total mystery, nobody knows where that comes from.

51:38.660 --> 51:41.380
Actually nobody knows anything about voluntary action,

51:41.380 --> 51:43.900
but this is a complex case of it.

51:43.900 --> 51:47.220
So that's another major problem.

51:47.220 --> 51:49.900
There are other problems about, you can go on,

51:49.900 --> 51:53.020
problems about what constitutes thought,

51:53.020 --> 51:56.500
what the animals do, how is human thought different

51:56.500 --> 52:00.060
from the cognition of other organisms.

52:00.060 --> 52:03.300
These are mixtures of philosophy and science,

52:03.300 --> 52:07.060
which I don't think divide very clearly.

52:07.060 --> 52:10.980
Philosophers are studying some of the more general aspects

52:10.980 --> 52:13.100
of what the science is doing.

52:14.700 --> 52:17.820
And plenty of people just cross the boundaries.

52:17.820 --> 52:19.260
Don't pay any attention.

52:19.260 --> 52:22.900
Are you committed to a purely materialistic,

52:22.900 --> 52:27.900
physicalism approach to anything having to do with the mind?

52:29.020 --> 52:30.260
Another way to put it is,

52:30.260 --> 52:33.780
what is the ontological status of the mental?

52:33.780 --> 52:35.460
To be contrary, and again,

52:35.460 --> 52:39.020
I've always taken exactly the opposite position.

52:39.980 --> 52:43.740
In my, as I've argued at some length,

52:43.740 --> 52:47.780
there was a concept of matter

52:47.780 --> 52:51.220
in the early scientific revolution.

52:51.220 --> 52:53.220
It's called the mechanical philosophy.

52:54.380 --> 52:56.740
The world is a complex machine,

52:57.740 --> 53:00.140
a much more complex and intricate version

53:00.140 --> 53:04.100
of what skilled artisans were developing

53:04.100 --> 53:06.580
all around Europe at the time.

53:06.580 --> 53:10.340
The world is just a far more complex variant of that.

53:10.340 --> 53:14.700
That was held right through the major part

53:14.700 --> 53:17.020
of early modern science.

53:17.020 --> 53:21.860
Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Leibniz, Huygens,

53:21.860 --> 53:24.860
all the great scientists assumed this.

53:24.900 --> 53:26.380
Newton disproved it.

53:27.340 --> 53:31.140
He showed that the world is not a machine in a sense.

53:31.140 --> 53:32.380
He didn't believe it.

53:32.380 --> 53:34.180
He thought it was the most so absurd

53:34.180 --> 53:37.380
that nobody with any scientific understanding

53:37.380 --> 53:39.540
could possibly believe this.

53:39.540 --> 53:42.580
And that's why he called his major book,

53:42.580 --> 53:46.500
mathematical principles, not physical principles.

53:46.500 --> 53:49.020
He said, I don't have a physical theory.

53:49.020 --> 53:53.340
All I have is mathematical principles that seem to work.

53:53.340 --> 53:56.940
He was sharply condemned for by Leibniz

53:56.940 --> 53:58.500
for the great figures.

53:58.500 --> 54:02.580
Well, at that point, the concept of matter disappeared.

54:03.460 --> 54:06.380
Matter is just whatever we postulate

54:06.380 --> 54:08.020
in our best theories of the world.

54:09.020 --> 54:10.500
There's no bounds.

54:10.500 --> 54:13.740
If it turns out to be massless particles,

54:13.740 --> 54:16.460
okay, it's massless particles.

54:16.460 --> 54:19.260
Turns out to, whatever it turns out to be,

54:19.260 --> 54:20.700
that's what it is.

54:20.740 --> 54:23.260
But there's no fixed notion

54:23.260 --> 54:26.260
of the material or the physical.

54:26.260 --> 54:29.580
Some philosophers try to hang on to it.

54:29.580 --> 54:33.740
Say, well, maybe the physical is spatio-temporal.

54:34.580 --> 54:36.500
Now we're back to Locke's suggestion.

54:38.580 --> 54:42.180
My thinking does not take place in my feet.

54:42.180 --> 54:45.420
It doesn't take place in a tree outside.

54:45.420 --> 54:47.620
It takes place up here.

54:47.620 --> 54:51.700
So it's spatio-temporally contained.

54:51.700 --> 54:54.900
So therefore, all of mine is physical.

54:56.100 --> 54:58.820
Since the word essentially has no meaning,

54:58.820 --> 55:02.460
just whatever our best theories say,

55:02.460 --> 55:04.300
you can say that if you want.

55:04.300 --> 55:07.340
But I think the question's just disappeared.

55:07.340 --> 55:10.900
There is no coherent notion of materialism

55:10.900 --> 55:12.700
as far as I can see.

55:12.700 --> 55:15.700
It's just whatever the science has come up with

55:15.700 --> 55:19.540
as their best explanations, that's materialism.

55:19.540 --> 55:23.380
The trend in philosophy of mine in the last decades

55:23.380 --> 55:27.900
has been moving away from what is classically called

55:27.900 --> 55:32.900
materialism, that everything mental can be reduced

55:33.220 --> 55:35.380
in some way in some future science,

55:35.380 --> 55:37.300
maybe not for a thousand years,

55:37.300 --> 55:40.940
to physical processes in the brain,

55:40.940 --> 55:43.580
whether it's at the neuronal level

55:43.620 --> 55:45.540
or the internal neuronal level

55:45.540 --> 55:47.260
or the quantum physical level,

55:47.260 --> 55:49.420
but still physical within the brain.

55:49.420 --> 55:53.780
And so many philosophers today are moving away from that

55:53.780 --> 55:57.900
and say that we'll never be able to explain the qualia,

55:57.900 --> 56:01.140
the inner experience that we all have,

56:01.140 --> 56:03.220
and that you need to go beyond

56:03.220 --> 56:05.300
what is traditionally called physicalism,

56:05.300 --> 56:07.460
whether it's panpsychism,

56:07.460 --> 56:11.180
where everything has a little bit of mental capacity

56:11.220 --> 56:12.820
or some kind of dualism

56:12.820 --> 56:15.860
where there's a non-physical reality interacting,

56:15.860 --> 56:19.140
but there has been a trend in that direction

56:19.140 --> 56:22.420
that purely physical explanation of the brain

56:22.420 --> 56:25.740
will never fully explain the mental.

56:26.780 --> 56:28.860
Well, the problem with that is

56:28.860 --> 56:30.600
there is no notion of physical.

56:31.820 --> 56:33.860
Actually, this was put very well

56:33.860 --> 56:37.780
by fine psychologist, Gell and Strossen,

56:37.780 --> 56:40.660
who does commit a depend psychism.

56:41.220 --> 56:43.700
But he was talking about consciousness.

56:43.700 --> 56:45.620
He said, there's no problem about consciousness.

56:45.620 --> 56:47.820
We all know exactly what it is.

56:47.820 --> 56:50.940
Consciousness is what I'm experiencing now.

56:50.940 --> 56:53.660
The problem is with the physical.

56:53.660 --> 56:56.940
When you talk about reducing consciousness to physical,

56:56.940 --> 56:59.100
you don't know what physical is.

56:59.100 --> 57:02.420
Physical is just whatever the sciences say.

57:02.420 --> 57:05.420
So consciousness is gonna be part of it.

57:05.420 --> 57:08.300
Actually, it goes back to Russell pretty much.

57:08.300 --> 57:09.980
And I think that's correct.

57:09.980 --> 57:11.860
There is no physicalism.

57:11.860 --> 57:15.860
So whatever's going on in my mind

57:15.860 --> 57:18.500
and your mind is in your brains.

57:18.500 --> 57:20.740
It's not going on somewhere else.

57:20.740 --> 57:22.580
Well, the brains are,

57:22.580 --> 57:24.460
if the brain isn't a physical object,

57:24.460 --> 57:26.140
I don't know what is.

57:26.140 --> 57:29.700
So therefore, it's going on in your brain.

57:29.700 --> 57:33.060
It's some sort of process going on in there,

57:33.060 --> 57:34.220
not anywhere else.

57:35.580 --> 57:37.780
The rest is just idle talk.

57:37.780 --> 57:40.780
But Galen Strausson, who's a very good example

57:40.780 --> 57:43.100
and people can see his videos on Closer to Truth.

57:43.100 --> 57:44.900
He's a good friend.

57:44.900 --> 57:49.740
He would say that you need to have some deeper understanding

57:49.740 --> 57:54.740
of the nature of all physical properties

57:55.020 --> 57:58.380
in order to understand how the brain can generate

57:58.380 --> 58:01.780
in some way, the concept of consciousness.

58:01.780 --> 58:03.940
You put in the word physical.

58:03.940 --> 58:08.060
You have to, as I understand his views,

58:08.060 --> 58:09.700
which I think I agree with,

58:09.700 --> 58:13.780
you have to have an understanding of the nature of the world

58:13.780 --> 58:17.700
in order to find how the mind functions.

58:17.700 --> 58:20.900
Because the mind is just part of the world

58:20.900 --> 58:25.620
as Locke famously should be famously,

58:25.620 --> 58:27.660
unfortunately he's forgotten.

58:27.660 --> 58:29.820
But as he pointed out,

58:29.820 --> 58:31.820
there's no reason not to regard

58:31.820 --> 58:35.580
thinking as a property of organized matter.

58:35.580 --> 58:38.180
Whatever matter turns out to be,

58:38.180 --> 58:40.140
we don't know what's gonna turn out to be.

58:40.140 --> 58:42.260
Sure, I think that is an approach

58:42.260 --> 58:44.860
that there's an expanded understanding

58:44.860 --> 58:47.500
of what reality is that we call matter and something else.

58:47.500 --> 58:51.380
But whatever it is, that's the total reality of the world.

58:51.380 --> 58:52.300
And there may be things

58:52.300 --> 58:55.140
that we totally don't understand that now,

58:55.140 --> 58:57.700
whether it's panpsychism or something else.

58:57.700 --> 59:00.460
I don't go along with Strausson

59:00.460 --> 59:03.860
as far as he does to the panpsychism.

59:03.860 --> 59:08.860
That is argument for panpsychism is based on a serious point.

59:10.220 --> 59:13.100
Can there be what he calls radically emergence?

59:14.540 --> 59:18.140
Tirely new properties somehow developing

59:18.140 --> 59:23.140
without any elements of them in earlier structures.

59:23.420 --> 59:25.340
I think that happens all the time.

59:26.300 --> 59:30.620
There's nothing in the hydrogen atom,

59:30.620 --> 59:32.340
which says you're a liquid.

59:32.340 --> 59:37.340
Changes take place with levels of complexity increasing

59:38.740 --> 59:41.140
that bring about entirely new phenomena.

59:42.060 --> 59:44.380
So I don't, that's a strong argument.

59:44.380 --> 59:47.780
The critical mass of an atomic bomb is a good example

59:47.780 --> 59:49.580
where you have uranium-235,

59:49.580 --> 59:51.860
a certain purity of it,

59:51.860 --> 59:54.580
and it'll be inert, it'll be radioactive,

59:54.580 --> 59:57.660
but you add one more microgram

59:57.660 --> 59:59.260
and then you have an atomic bomb

59:59.260 --> 01:00:00.780
because it hits that critical mass.

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:02.460
It's a simple analogy, but...

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.260
It's just that everything in nature is like that.

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:11.380
Back to eukaryotic cells, which I meant, or water.

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.180
The properties of water aren't detectable

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:16.740
in hydrogen and oxygen.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:18.020
But this is a critical point,

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:19.340
and I'm gonna push it a little bit further,

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.540
because with hydrogen and oxygen,

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.780
we can understand how,

01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:27.660
when you understand the science of bonding and flow

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:30.460
and molecules slipping by one another,

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.700
that with advanced science,

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:37.700
you can, in fact, predict or reverse engineer

01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:40.100
from when you know the structure

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.300
to why that becomes liquid.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.540
Now, the question is,

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:48.460
is everything about the mind of that same character

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:50.580
where eventually science,

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:54.300
given as much time as you want, 10,000 years,

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:55.740
be able to access it?

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.420
Or are there aspects of the mental

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:02.580
that are forever beyond the purview of science?

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:05.700
No more than aspects of motion.

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.500
Go back to Newton and Leibniz.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.860
They had no problem understanding

01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:14.300
Newton's theories of gravity.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.380
Okay, it was what they described

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:19.820
that was unintelligible.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:22.940
We cannot conceive, as Locke said,

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:26.580
we cannot conceive of objects interacting

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:29.140
in a mechanical fashion.

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.100
And we can't, it's a fact.

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:35.300
Science just gave up the task of trying to.

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:39.620
Galileo through Newton and Leibniz,

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:42.540
science was trying to develop a picture

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:47.100
of an intelligible world that was given up.

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:49.180
We don't try to do that anymore.

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:53.780
We try to find intelligible theories of the world,

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:55.620
like Newton's theory,

01:01:55.620 --> 01:02:00.620
or the theory of how hydrogen and oxygen molecules

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:04.740
yield water, but it's not intelligible.

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:08.560
We can't, we have no grasp of what's going on.

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.740
We understand the theory, we can follow it,

01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:12.520
as you say, we predicted.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:16.860
That's now the goal of science for hundreds of years,

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:19.420
since basically since Newton,

01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:22.100
which abandoned the Galilean hope

01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:26.900
of developing an intelligible world.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:30.180
So can you do that for the mind?

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:34.140
No reason why.

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:36.340
Maybe we can't, maybe we don't have

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:39.300
the intellectual capacity to do it,

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.060
but that doesn't mean there's no explanation for it.

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:47.580
I mean, we're not angels, we're organisms.

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:52.580
Our mental capacities have certain scope, certain limits,

01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:57.260
but no reason to believe that we can understand everything.

01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:59.100
So in the philosophy of science,

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.540
would you classify yourself as an anti-realist

01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:07.540
in the sense that we have access to empirical information,

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:10.620
we can sense regularities,

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.620
but there's really no hope of understanding reality

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:17.140
as it is quite reality in itself.

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.100
No, I don't.

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:20.340
We can understand it to the extent

01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.980
that humans are capable of understanding things.

01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:27.300
We are, I don't know about you,

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:31.780
but I have no grasp of,

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:35.940
I can follow the theory that explains how hydrogen

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:40.460
oxygen end up feeling like a liquid,

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:42.220
but I don't have any grasp of it.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.060
I can follow the theory, okay?

01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:47.100
And that's the way science works.

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:52.740
I have no grasp of it, field of force, let's say.

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:57.020
I understand it can work with vector spaces and so on,

01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:01.540
but that doesn't give me what Tom Nagel

01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:03.580
calls a feeling of what it is.

01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:07.620
We don't have a feeling of that about anything,

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:13.780
but we can do the best we can to try to find theories

01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:17.660
that explain the properties that we discovered.

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:21.580
Now we can understand the theories, maybe get better ones.

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:25.100
Can we get good enough ones to explain,

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:27.820
say, elements of consciousness?

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.340
You never know.

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:32.860
You can, you know, as you learn and study more,

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:36.180
you find more, then you find more problems.

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:38.980
Not science, you know, it's like hill climbing.

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:42.060
You climb a hill, you think you've gotten somewhere,

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:44.660
you look up and there's a big hill.

01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:46.940
It's all the whole history of science.

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:49.060
No, one of the questions we'd love to ask

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:52.940
on Close to the Truth is a two-word question,

01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:56.340
two-word sentence, what exists?

01:04:56.340 --> 01:05:00.940
And by that, what we mean are what are the minimum number

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:04.460
of non-reducible categories that you need

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:07.740
to explain all of reality?

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:12.740
Science has its own answers, partial answers.

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:16.660
So they might say elementary particles.

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:22.420
Then you pick up a quantum theory journal

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:26.380
and you find a symposium of great scientists

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.260
about what is a particle?

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.780
All kind of views.

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:34.700
Basically, we know some things about it,

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:37.660
but we really don't know what a particle is.

01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.700
Okay, so you go on to the next step.

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:45.100
I don't think these are questions that can have answers.

01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.980
They have answers, but only answers

01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:50.660
that you move towards as you learn more.

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:53.140
How far you'll go is never anyway to know.

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:57.980
Along the way, you cast aside problems

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:01.340
as ones we can't deal with,

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:06.340
the way science afternoon cast aside the problem of motion.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.780
You go back to the 17th century,

01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:12.700
they had a concept of hard problem.

01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:15.100
Today, the fashion is to say

01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:18.020
that the hard problem is consciousness.

01:06:18.020 --> 01:06:22.340
17th century, what they called the hard problem was motion.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:26.700
Problem was never solved, it was abandoned.

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.740
And then the last question,

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.660
which in one sense is the very first question

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:32.860
that we'd love to ask is,

01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:35.860
why is there something rather than nothing?

01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:38.180
Why is there anything at all?

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:40.180
And the question I want to ask you,

01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:42.660
is that a legitimate question to ask?

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.980
Because we ask it, but one of the claims

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:47.380
is that that's not a question

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:50.020
that you should be able to ask.

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:53.540
Well, the best answer to that that I heard

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:57.820
was by a great philosopher, personal friend,

01:06:57.820 --> 01:06:59.500
you know, Sidney Morgan Besser.

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:03.380
Sid was asked that once, and he said,

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:06.700
look, if there was nothing, you'd be fetching about that.

01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:11.220
Covetching in terms of our common answers,

01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:12.300
this means complaining.

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:15.580
I learned that from my grandmother.

01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:18.820
No, and this has been an absolute delight.

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:20.340
I wish we could go on forever.

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.380
You have made such contributions,

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.660
not just to linguistics,

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:27.700
but to ways of thinking, challenging us in linguistics,

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:30.060
certainly in political science,

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:31.980
even if some of us may disagree

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:35.020
with some of the things that you say in all categories,

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:37.700
you've had a tremendous contribution

01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:40.940
to intellectual thought, to the enjoyment

01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:45.500
and the appreciation of reality over these seven decades

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:48.020
for you, certainly my entire lifetime,

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:51.060
on a personal basis, it's great to experience

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:53.700
this real interaction with you now.

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.820
As I said, we met at MIT very briefly, 40 years ago.

01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:59.460
So it's just a great pleasure for me.

01:07:59.460 --> 01:08:02.500
And I look forward to another session,

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.580
70 or so years from now.

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.620
We'll discuss some of the same things

01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:10.580
and see how you've progressed over that time.

01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:12.700
We'll have the same mysteries, I think.

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:15.020
All the best, all the best.

01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:16.380
Thank you.

01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:17.380
Good to be with you.

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:20.980
Thank you for watching.
