00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
The language is a core part of human cognition. It's language that constructs thoughts.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.760
That's where thoughts come from.

00:17.280 --> 00:22.080
Welcome to Closer to Truth Chats. Today I'm speaking with Noam Chomsky, the distinguished

00:22.080 --> 00:28.080
theoretical linguist, analytic philosopher, and cognitive scientist who is one of the most cited

00:28.080 --> 00:34.320
living scholars. Closer to Truth is presenting this four-part mini-series with Professor Chomsky.

00:34.320 --> 00:40.320
Part three focuses on the implications of Chomsky's linguistic theories, especially universal

00:40.320 --> 00:48.160
grammar, for human sentient cognition, evolution, and uniqueness. Noam, let's start with how a

00:48.160 --> 00:54.320
universal grammar affects the understanding of human development. You've talked about how a

00:54.320 --> 00:59.040
baby learns language and the importance of a universal grammar.

00:59.040 --> 01:07.600
First of all, let's turn to some things that are now pretty well established by experiment.

01:09.680 --> 01:18.880
There have by now been careful statistical studies of the data available to a young child,

01:18.960 --> 01:26.240
two or three-year-old child, mainly by Charles Yang, a cognitive scientist at the University

01:26.240 --> 01:34.160
of Pennsylvania. Careful analysis, he's shown that it's extremely sparse. There are a lot of words,

01:34.160 --> 01:40.240
but the same words keep repairing over and over. There's a phenomenon, there's a descriptive

01:40.320 --> 01:50.800
phenomenon known as Zipp's law, which shows about the rank frequency distribution of words in a text.

01:51.520 --> 01:59.760
Turns out that some words like the A appear many, many times. As you get to other words,

01:59.760 --> 02:07.120
they appear fewer times. Most words appear maybe once in a long text. Well, that means the actual

02:07.680 --> 02:15.120
data available to a child may be many occurrences of words, but very few words, very few

02:16.480 --> 02:24.560
bigrams, pairs of repeated words, and so on. So the data is very sparse. Studies of language

02:24.560 --> 02:34.880
acquisition, the most exciting of them by Lila Gleitman, a friend and colleague who

02:35.520 --> 02:42.560
passed away a couple of weeks ago, great scientist, her work and other work demonstrated

02:43.280 --> 02:52.480
that children have very impressive linguistic knowledge at a point where they can't exhibit it.

02:53.760 --> 03:02.240
So some of her early work back in the 60s had to do with what's called telegraphic speech.

03:03.040 --> 03:11.200
There's a period in language development. A young child will only use what sounds like

03:11.200 --> 03:18.560
the way telegraphic speech works, only substantive words like want, cookie, let's say, something like

03:18.560 --> 03:27.760
that. That's speech. So it turns out, I won't go through the experiment, but it turns out that

03:28.640 --> 03:36.480
at that age, the child doesn't understand telegraphic speech. It only understands normal speech,

03:37.200 --> 03:44.080
meaning that in its mind, it already has the whole complex system. It's just not producing it.

03:45.200 --> 03:53.360
Turns out that the meanings of words, complex words, are learned with almost maybe one or two

03:53.440 --> 03:58.640
presentations. Somehow it's all in the mind and just comes out when it's triggered.

04:00.560 --> 04:06.160
Things like, take say, again, structure dependence, the principle that I mentioned,

04:06.800 --> 04:15.520
the fact that all operations in all languages depend, keep only to the abstract structure

04:15.520 --> 04:22.880
that the mind creates and ignores the all of the evidence that is presented, linear order.

04:23.520 --> 04:31.520
So from the earliest testable age on through life, we ignore 100% of what we hear

04:32.160 --> 04:38.720
and use only abstract structures that our mind creates. Actually, no way for this to be learned.

04:38.720 --> 04:47.280
It's inconceivable, literally inconceivable. And that means it's just built in. We now have an

04:47.280 --> 04:54.880
understanding of why that actually comes from, is forced by the simplest computational operation.

04:55.680 --> 05:03.600
If you go back to what I said about evolution, some disruptive change takes place. Mother nature

05:04.320 --> 05:11.440
figures out the simplest way of reconstructing the system, accommodating that disruption.

05:11.440 --> 05:16.480
That seems to be what happened with language. Soon as the disruption took place,

05:17.520 --> 05:25.120
the system was created in the simplest possible terms that yields automatically such things as

05:26.640 --> 05:34.240
structural, structure preservation, the other kinds of phenomena I've been describing.

05:35.120 --> 05:42.800
It must also be the explanation for the meanings of words, but there it's mysterious. We don't know

05:42.800 --> 05:50.400
how just whether it happened, but don't know how. Well, what does that tell us about human cognition?

05:51.600 --> 05:58.240
Tells us that probably a very substantial language is a core part of human cognition.

05:58.880 --> 06:03.200
It's language that constructs thoughts. That's where thoughts come from,

06:04.320 --> 06:12.080
any kind of thought that we can comprehend at least is simply basically language. It's what

06:12.080 --> 06:18.640
language produces. So that's a core part of our nature. That's what distinguishes us from other

06:18.640 --> 06:27.520
species, thought and language. And these core parts of our nature seem to be quite substantially

06:28.240 --> 06:39.600
simply built into our nature, shared by all humans, developing through triggering by environmental

06:39.600 --> 06:46.960
stimuli can lead to what look to very different outcomes. But as soon as we look more deeply,

06:46.960 --> 06:55.600
we find that these are surfaced variations based on fundamental similarities. Well, I think that

06:55.680 --> 07:03.360
tells us a good bit about one of the few parts of human cognitive capacity that we know anything

07:03.360 --> 07:12.640
about about the Jerry Fodor great philosopher cognitive scientist that once joked that cognitive

07:12.640 --> 07:19.920
science is the study of vision and language. It's not far from the truth. Language is one

07:19.920 --> 07:27.840
part of it. Vision is another big part of it. Vision works the same way. It turns out that

07:27.840 --> 07:36.480
by now it's understood that very limited stimulation is necessary if an infant,

07:37.200 --> 07:44.480
we don't experiment with infants, but humans have the same visual system as other mammals. So with

07:44.480 --> 07:53.680
other mammals, cats, monkeys, you can show that if you don't present patterned stimulation

07:54.320 --> 08:01.440
in the early days of life, the visual system won't function. It has to be set off by the word

08:01.440 --> 08:10.080
kinds of stimulation. And if you modify the kinds of stimulation, say horizontal lines instead of

08:10.080 --> 08:16.720
vertical lines, it'll affect the way the visual system develops. That's pretty much like language.

08:17.760 --> 08:25.280
It's not the first weeks of life. It's the first year or two of life. The basic system is set one

08:25.280 --> 08:34.560
or another way. And then it just grows out of the nature endowed us with true the visual system.

08:35.360 --> 08:44.640
It's true of ambulatory system, the way you walk and so on. It's true of language. It seems to be

08:44.640 --> 08:50.640
just the way organisms, it's true of other organisms that we know of. So that seems to be

08:50.640 --> 08:57.840
the pretty much the way organisms develop. There are plenty of differences. So we have a

08:57.840 --> 09:08.240
different culture than, say, the Bantu who separated from other humans over 100,000 years ago.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.400
Different culture, but basically the same. If you take an infant from that culture and

09:17.200 --> 09:24.400
raise it in Boston, it'll go to Harvard and become a quantum physicist. Conversely,

09:25.120 --> 09:31.280
it doesn't seem to be any detectable cognitive difference. So there are a lot of things we

09:31.280 --> 09:38.320
learned from this. In the 60, 65, going on 70 years since you've developed the ideas,

09:38.320 --> 09:44.720
particularly the universal grammar, neuroscience in particular, which was my original field,

09:44.720 --> 09:54.320
has mushroomed with ability to do functional NMRs, all different kinds of scanning devices,

09:54.560 --> 10:02.000
plasticity in neuroscience. So as you have seen the development of neuroscience over these decades,

10:02.640 --> 10:13.760
how do some of the structural concepts relate to the abstract ideas of hierarchical structural

10:13.760 --> 10:21.680
building in the language system? Because your ideas with these kind of cognitive concepts,

10:22.320 --> 10:33.280
which has to be instantiated in brain tissue. So how has neuroscience affected or confirmed or

10:33.280 --> 10:43.040
questioned the cognitive ideas that you've had? Well, first of all, let's recognize that the brain

10:43.040 --> 10:50.320
sciences are a very difficult field. First of all, because of the complexity of the brain,

10:50.880 --> 10:57.760
but also for ethical reasons, you cannot do the experiments that come to mind.

10:58.720 --> 11:08.080
You can't do invasive experiments with humans. We know a lot about vision, but that's through

11:08.080 --> 11:14.880
invasive experiments with other animals, which have pretty much the same visual system.

11:15.760 --> 11:20.560
You can't do that with language, because there's no other organism that is any remotely like a

11:20.560 --> 11:28.880
language system. This is unique to humans. So comparative work is out. Direct invasive work

11:28.880 --> 11:37.680
is out. That means the kinds of research you can do are very restricted. So what you're talking

11:37.680 --> 11:46.480
about, which is real, sophisticated, significant, is basically imaging studies where you try to

11:47.440 --> 11:53.680
look at things like rate of blood flow and one or another part of the brain to see what's happening.

11:56.800 --> 12:04.320
You cannot stick an electrode into the language areas of the brain and see what a particular

12:04.320 --> 12:11.040
neuron is doing. You can't, in principle, maybe if you're mangola, you can do it,

12:11.600 --> 12:20.960
but ethical considerations block it. You can't raise a child in a controlled environment to see

12:20.960 --> 12:27.360
what would happen. If you could do that, you could learn a lot about development, but it's

12:27.360 --> 12:34.480
ruled out. So the first point is experimentation is extremely limited, both by complexity,

12:34.480 --> 12:42.400
but simply for ethical reasons. Still, things have been learned, and there are some interesting

12:42.400 --> 12:49.440
results. The most interesting result I know of actually has to do with structured dependence,

12:50.080 --> 12:59.120
the thing I mentioned, the fact that the rules of language don't pay any attention to what we hear

12:59.120 --> 13:07.760
in linear order, but only to abstract structures that the mind constructs. There's experimental work

13:07.760 --> 13:18.320
on this, very interesting. It's done under the design of Andrea Moro, Italian linguist,

13:18.320 --> 13:25.440
whose friend of ours, very good linguist. He designed experiments which were carried out

13:26.800 --> 13:35.760
by an advanced neuroscience group at Milan in Italy, where the design of the experiment is

13:35.760 --> 13:47.120
basically this. You have monolingual subjects, maybe speakers of German, and you develop

13:47.840 --> 13:54.960
invented languages, not real languages, invented ones with kind of like Jabberwocky,

13:54.960 --> 14:03.200
you know, words that don't exist, and have two different kinds of inventive languages.

14:04.080 --> 14:09.920
One of them modeled on a language they don't know, maybe Japanese.

14:11.200 --> 14:23.680
The other, using simple computational operations on linear order. So what will be interpreted

14:23.680 --> 14:32.560
as negation takes the third word in a sentence and makes that the negative particle, very simple

14:32.560 --> 14:42.400
computation. Okay, so give the subjects these two kinds of materials. What he found is that when

14:42.400 --> 14:52.160
you give them materials based on an existing language, the areas of the brain that are involved

14:52.160 --> 14:59.280
in language processing are all lighting up, they're working. When you give them the ones using

15:00.240 --> 15:07.040
simple computations like linear order, you get diffuse brain activity, meaning it's been

15:07.040 --> 15:15.440
being treated as a puzzle, not language. There's actually supporting psycholinguistic evidence.

15:16.800 --> 15:24.320
Neil Smith, a British linguist, fine, British linguist, also a friend, had been working for

15:24.320 --> 15:34.160
many years with a subject who he named Chris. It's a person who has extremely limited cognitive

15:34.160 --> 15:42.160
abilities, almost nothing, but fantastic linguistic capacities. We put a grammar book in front of him

15:42.160 --> 15:46.960
of some language you never heard of, pretty soon he knows the whole language, you know.

15:47.920 --> 15:54.960
He did pretty much the same experiments with Chris. Chris could do nothing with the puzzles,

15:55.600 --> 16:03.360
nothing, just blank stare with the system modeled on an actual language, he just treated it like

16:03.360 --> 16:11.680
any other language. Well, all of this strongly suggests something, that there are brain areas

16:11.680 --> 16:17.200
specifically attuned to language, and they will pick out the structures

16:19.120 --> 16:27.040
and force us to operate the way I've described. We have plenty of other cognitive capacities,

16:27.040 --> 16:34.160
we can solve lots of puzzles, but they seem to be dissociated from language. Now this fits

16:34.160 --> 16:41.680
with a lot of work that's been done from another direction. Eric Leneberg mentioned earlier,

16:42.240 --> 16:49.840
friend of mine in college, one of the three students who were disagreeing with everything

16:49.840 --> 16:57.280
when we were grad students at Harvard in the early 50s. He went on to found modern biology of language,

16:57.920 --> 17:05.600
and among the topics that he studied were what are called dissociations, people who have a

17:05.600 --> 17:13.520
high capacity in one area of cognition, but very little in some other area. So he began to study

17:14.800 --> 17:22.240
subjects with good language capacity, but poor cognitive capacities and conversely,

17:23.120 --> 17:30.000
similar work. Now that's been extended significantly since one of the main people is

17:30.800 --> 17:38.880
Susan Curtis, cognitive scientist at San Diego University in California, has done extensive

17:38.880 --> 17:48.560
work on dissociations, and it has pretty much the same results. You find cognitive

17:49.440 --> 17:57.040
dissociations in both directions of many kinds. It looks as though language capacity

17:57.040 --> 18:07.040
is dissociated from other cognitive capacities. That's one of the reasons why very popular efforts

18:07.040 --> 18:13.440
to try to show that language developed out of general cognition, that one reason why they always

18:13.440 --> 18:21.680
fail, these are just different capacities. So there is a neuroscience, and this is one example,

18:21.680 --> 18:31.680
the best example I know of neuroscientific support for fundamental principles that emerge in

18:33.600 --> 18:38.880
the study of language itself and psychology of language. There are other things about

18:39.840 --> 18:46.400
hierarchical structure and so on, but it's very difficult to establish because the kinds of work

18:46.400 --> 18:51.680
you'd like to do, you just can't do. What can a universal grammar tell us about the evolution

18:51.680 --> 18:57.120
of language? Your book with Robert Berwick, Why Only Us, Language and Evolution, really a

18:57.760 --> 19:05.440
superb book, deals with the questions. One of the issues that you have is the origin to

19:05.440 --> 19:10.320
understand the evolution of language. You have to understand what is language, and the common idea

19:10.320 --> 19:17.680
that communication is the function of language, you say, derives from the mistaken belief that

19:17.680 --> 19:25.040
language somehow is an evolution of animal communication. You have this radical distinction

19:25.040 --> 19:31.840
between human language and systems of animal communication. First of all, we should notice

19:31.840 --> 19:38.720
that the common phrase that you repeated, communication is the function of language.

19:39.280 --> 19:46.080
It's totally meaningless. Organic systems don't have a function or they have many functions.

19:46.960 --> 19:57.120
So what's the function of the spine? Is it to help us stand up? Is it to accumulate calcium?

19:57.920 --> 20:06.800
Is it to develop white blood cells? Is it as a casing for a nerve? Actually, it's all of those

20:06.800 --> 20:18.320
things. Let's go back to evolution again. First, a disruption takes place, a mutation, symbiosis,

20:18.960 --> 20:25.440
some other thing, many things. Then comes the reconstruction stage. Nature

20:26.480 --> 20:33.600
tries to make the best of whatever happened. If it was a mutation, try to organize the new system

20:33.600 --> 20:41.600
in the best possible way. Then comes the winnowing stage, where among the things that have been

20:41.600 --> 20:48.640
created, the more adaptable ones survive natural selection. But at the second stage,

20:49.600 --> 20:55.440
nature hasn't the slightest idea what the functions are going to be. It doesn't care about them.

20:56.000 --> 21:03.760
It's just finding the best design based on what's around. Now that often leads to highly

21:03.760 --> 21:10.320
dysfunctional systems, because it may be that the best thing is not well designed for

21:11.120 --> 21:17.680
functions we'd like it to carry out. So for example, during this last year,

21:18.560 --> 21:27.840
I've discovered that ears are highly dysfunctional for wearing masks when you have glasses and a

21:27.840 --> 21:34.640
hearing aid. It's a horrible pain in the neck. Nature made a terrible mistake and should have had

21:34.640 --> 21:42.560
different kind of ears. Well, same's true of the spine. And any engineer could engineer a better

21:42.560 --> 21:48.400
system than the spine. But the way it developed over time, this is the best that could be done.

21:49.040 --> 21:55.120
So talk about communication being the function of language is, first of all, meaningful.

21:56.240 --> 22:03.280
Okay, because language is developed, it's used for many functions. For thinking, for reflection,

22:03.280 --> 22:12.080
for many kinds of actions, among them is communication. But the idea that's hidden behind

22:12.080 --> 22:18.400
it is what you said, that language somehow evolved from animal communication systems.

22:19.760 --> 22:27.680
The evidence is overwhelming that that's not the case. Take even just what I've just suggested,

22:27.680 --> 22:34.640
discuss the brief things I've discussed, like structure dependence. There's nothing remotely

22:34.640 --> 22:44.400
like it in any animal system. And take the meanings of words, the meaning of river, house, tree,

22:44.400 --> 22:52.320
anything. Nothing remotely like it in animal communication. In fact, in animal symbolic

22:52.320 --> 23:00.080
systems, the symbols actually do have associations with non-linguistic entities.

23:01.040 --> 23:09.840
So if you look at the cries of a monkey, various cries of say, a verbate monkey, there'll be

23:10.640 --> 23:19.360
a cry that is made when leaves start moving in a certain way in a tree and all the other monkeys

23:19.360 --> 23:26.800
run away. We interpret that as a warning signal. What the monkey's doing, we don't know. But it's

23:26.800 --> 23:32.320
interpreted as a warning signal. Maybe there's an eagle up there, the monkey's run away.

23:33.360 --> 23:43.760
A hormonal change can lead to a call that basically means I'm hungry. Again, what's

23:43.760 --> 23:52.160
going on in the animal's mind, we don't know. But all animal communication systems, the symbols seem

23:52.160 --> 24:02.800
to be one-one associated with extra-mental entities, say that a physicist could detect.

24:03.360 --> 24:09.840
Human language has nothing like that, totally different. The structural principles, the rules

24:09.840 --> 24:17.040
of combination, not even the remotest analog in other organisms. So what are the implications of

24:17.040 --> 24:24.720
that for human uniqueness? You point out in the book that the primate brain in great apes or chimpanzees

24:25.280 --> 24:30.080
looks like it has a language readiness, but obviously, as you say, there is no language there.

24:30.080 --> 24:35.840
So what are the implications for human uniqueness? It means it's just like every other system.

24:36.560 --> 24:44.960
Visions say there's visual readiness, which is built into mammalian visual systems.

24:45.680 --> 24:51.840
It's readiness. It doesn't show up unless it's stimulated. You don't trigger it,

24:52.640 --> 25:01.600
it degenerates. The way you stimulate it depends on how it develops. These are classic results in

25:02.560 --> 25:10.080
study of vision. Language is the same. How did it develop? Well, we talk about this in the book

25:10.080 --> 25:18.080
you mentioned. Not too much is known, but there are some suggestions about, mainly based on work of

25:18.240 --> 25:30.400
German Neuroscientist Dr. Friedrichi has had some good ideas about how the brain,

25:30.400 --> 25:39.040
small changes in the brain, might have provided the principle of what's called recursive generation,

25:39.600 --> 25:46.560
the principle that allows us to create an infinite number of structures,

25:46.560 --> 25:52.320
basically thoughts from a finite number of symbols. It's called recursive generation.

25:53.040 --> 25:58.720
Sure, work shows how certain small changes in the brain might have led to that.

25:59.440 --> 26:06.880
Well, that would give us recursive generation. Nature takes over, does it in the simplest possible

26:06.880 --> 26:16.240
way, connects it somehow to our conceptual systems. You have language. In fact, many different languages

26:16.320 --> 26:26.320
depending on how it's externalized in sound, or mostly in sound sign, looks pretty much like

26:26.320 --> 26:33.040
that's what pretty much happened. Now, this is almost nobody in the field of evolution of language

26:33.040 --> 26:42.560
believes this. Everybody believes it must have been by a slow, small process of natural selection.

26:43.520 --> 26:50.320
But in my view, as I've said, I think that's simply based on a misunderstanding

26:50.960 --> 26:59.200
of the theory of evolution, one concepts that were held 40 or 50 years ago, but have long been

26:59.200 --> 27:07.680
abandoned, and a failure to bother to look at the nature of language. If you want to study the

27:08.320 --> 27:16.720
evolution of any system, whatever it is, E. coli, anything, you first have to identify

27:16.720 --> 27:22.320
the phenotype. You have to say, what's the nature of the system that I'm interested in?

27:23.120 --> 27:28.640
You don't do that. You can't look at its evolution by definition. Well,

27:29.920 --> 27:37.200
much of the field doesn't look at the phenotype and is distorted by a misunderstanding of the

27:37.200 --> 27:47.760
theory of evolution. But if we extricate ourselves from these flaws, I think a relatively clear

27:47.760 --> 27:54.080
picture emerges of what might have happened with plenty of gaps to fill.

27:54.080 --> 27:59.040
Norm, I want to ask you about consciousness. Consciousness is a core part of closer to truth,

27:59.040 --> 28:05.200
and we examine it from all aspects, the neuroscience sure, but a limited materialism,

28:05.200 --> 28:11.360
but consciousness doesn't even exist. Neuroscience mechanisms, we deal with panpsychism, even to

28:11.360 --> 28:18.320
idealism. What could the language and particularly your understanding of language and human uniqueness

28:18.320 --> 28:24.640
contribute to the fierce debate in philosophy of mind about the deep nature of consciousness,

28:24.640 --> 28:32.960
if anything? I should say, first of all, that I'm not overly impressed by this ferocious debate,

28:32.960 --> 28:39.680
but we could talk about that. Actually, I think the basic answer to the debate was given

28:40.480 --> 28:47.520
by Bertrand Russell about a century ago. I've talked about it. Within philosophy,

28:47.520 --> 28:52.960
it's been developed particularly by Galen Strawson, a very good young philosopher.

28:53.840 --> 28:59.440
I think he's put it very clearly, basically Russell's point. He said,

28:59.520 --> 29:05.760
there's essentially no problem of consciousness. We know what consciousness is. That's the thing

29:05.760 --> 29:12.640
we know most about. That's all of our lives. It's consciousness. We know more about that than

29:12.640 --> 29:21.520
anything. I can tell you exactly what I'm conscious of right now in great detail, Russell's point.

29:22.080 --> 29:31.440
What we don't know is what matter is. That's what's obscure. In fact, I've written extensively

29:31.440 --> 29:37.360
about this, but it's a long story, but there has been no concept of matter since Newton.

29:38.560 --> 29:46.240
Newton demolished the concept of matter that was the basis of modern science. It was called

29:46.240 --> 29:51.360
the mechanical philosophy. The idea that the world is a very elaborate machine,

29:52.400 --> 30:04.320
Galileo, Leibniz, Huygens, Newton, all, Descartes, all adopted this. Newton demonstrated that it's

30:04.320 --> 30:11.840
not true. John Locke immediately, within a couple of years, understood the consequences

30:12.480 --> 30:22.160
and concluded that it follows that thinking must be a property of organized matter, whatever

30:22.160 --> 30:29.040
matter turns out to be. What matter turns out to be, we don't know. Science keeps changing,

30:29.040 --> 30:35.760
moving, trying to discover what it is. We know what consciousness is. We don't know what matter is.

30:36.720 --> 30:43.520
It's whatever the best theory of the world tells us. Then comes the problem of how

30:44.160 --> 30:51.680
to relate whatever the best theory of matter is with what consciousness is. Basically Locke's

30:51.680 --> 30:59.680
problem. How to think is a property of organized matter. Let's figure out how it works. That's

30:59.760 --> 31:06.320
what we've been discussing. What does language tell us about consciousness? I think it tells

31:06.320 --> 31:14.640
us something quite interesting. It tells us that almost all of the mental activity involved in

31:14.640 --> 31:22.880
language is inaccessible to consciousness. Everything I've discussed so far is inaccessible

31:22.880 --> 31:30.960
to consciousness. You can't introspect and discover that rules follow the principle of

31:30.960 --> 31:40.000
structured dependence. You can't introspect and find out why he stole many books. He reads many

31:40.000 --> 31:46.720
books, means of a racist reader, but many books are read by him. It doesn't mean that. You can't

31:47.680 --> 31:55.120
introspect and figure out how your mind is creating those two thoughts. That's virtually

31:55.120 --> 32:01.280
every all the use of language. Almost all of our use of language is just internal.

32:02.560 --> 32:08.480
What you and I are now doing, externalization, is a very small part of the use of language.

32:09.360 --> 32:15.040
Mostly we're thinking, we're reflecting. We have the slightest idea what's going on in there. We get

32:15.040 --> 32:21.600
little bits of fragments of it now and then reach consciousness. Well, all of that is unconscious.

32:21.600 --> 32:29.760
You have to study it pretty much the same way. You study our second nervous system. Humans have

32:29.760 --> 32:37.600
two nervous systems. One of them is this one. The other one is this one. It's called the enteric

32:37.600 --> 32:46.160
nervous system. Huge, complex nervous system. Huge number of neurons. Almost all the properties

32:46.160 --> 32:52.080
of this one, it's what regulates our whole body. We're totally unconscious of it except when we

32:52.080 --> 33:00.400
have a stomach ache and it says something's wrong. It has Alzheimer's. It has Parkinson's.

33:00.720 --> 33:07.840
It's a huge nervous system, but we haven't the slightest awareness of it except occasionally,

33:07.840 --> 33:14.640
stomach ache. It's pretty much the same as true of our main nervous system that's up here.

33:15.840 --> 33:21.440
We don't know what's going on inside it. We can't introspect. We have to study it

33:21.440 --> 33:29.520
from the outside, basically. When we can learn about it, we've been talking about some of the

33:29.520 --> 33:35.200
ways you can learn about it, but it leaves plenty of mysteries. I think what it tells us about

33:35.200 --> 33:43.040
consciousness is that consciousness is a pretty superficial part of human thought and cognition.

33:43.840 --> 33:50.880
Dits and pieces come out from what's going on in there and there's not much more. I should

33:50.880 --> 33:57.760
mention that the history of the study of consciousness is interesting. It's good scholarly work on it.

33:57.760 --> 34:06.480
Best work is by Udo Thiel, a good historian and a philosopher. He's pointed out that the study of

34:06.480 --> 34:13.680
consciousness in the modern sense is a very modern obsession. There wasn't much talk of

34:13.680 --> 34:21.360
consciousness in the history of philosophy until pretty much the 17th century. Then the parts of

34:21.360 --> 34:30.800
consciousness that were discussed were consciousness of the inner workings of our mind, not qualia,

34:30.800 --> 34:38.960
what it feels like to see the color red. That's a modern thing, pretty much 20th century.

34:38.960 --> 34:46.720
It's become a lead topic of philosophy, I think, in mistaken ways. The right way to look at it,

34:46.720 --> 34:56.000
I think, is Russell Strossen, the way I've just been talking about. But what language tells us,

34:56.000 --> 35:03.920
I think, is most of what's going on in our mental lives is inaccessible to consciousness.

35:03.920 --> 35:08.320
So there are really two questions here. One is the relationship between what we are conscious of,

35:08.320 --> 35:13.600
versus all the other things going on in our mind that are subconscious. Language is a spectacular

35:13.600 --> 35:19.440
example. And of course, the autonomic system we have really no access to, and happily so.

35:20.240 --> 35:28.080
The other question, though, is on qualia about why can we, as embodied creatures, have this

35:28.800 --> 35:35.120
scent of inner experience, felt experience? The two questions are separate. Maybe they're related.

35:36.160 --> 35:40.640
I appreciate your response to the first question in terms of relationship between

35:41.280 --> 35:45.840
in language that most things are subconscious, that we have no access to whatsoever.

35:46.800 --> 35:54.320
But what are your feelings about qualia? Gail Strossen, who was on Close to the Truth,

35:54.320 --> 36:02.320
good friend. We communicate. He has a kind of a panpsychic view of the world, that consciousness

36:02.320 --> 36:07.600
is everywhere. Russell had kind of a monism that I'm not sure I completely understand.

36:08.560 --> 36:17.360
What is your deep sense? Why not ask a deeper question about Locke's suggestion? What's the

36:17.360 --> 36:27.440
relation between whatever the brain is constituted of and thinking? That's a much more profound

36:27.440 --> 36:34.000
question. Well, it's a hard question. Most questions are hard. One question, which is,

36:34.000 --> 36:39.440
in my view, much less profound, is the one that philosophers are obsessed with. What's the

36:40.720 --> 36:49.120
basis in organized matter for perceiving the color red? Not for perceiving it. That we understand

36:49.120 --> 36:57.680
very well. The theory of how red is perceived is pretty well understood. But what it feels like

36:57.680 --> 37:03.840
to see red? We're probably never going to get an answer to that. I expect to get an answer.

37:05.280 --> 37:11.920
So, we know what we feel like. We can't describe it. Can you describe what you feel like when you

37:11.920 --> 37:19.840
see red? I can't. I mean, there's a lot of talk about, a lot of work was stimulated by Thomas

37:19.840 --> 37:27.120
Nagel's book on what it's like to be a bat. He argued persuasively that we can't really

37:27.680 --> 37:32.160
know what it's like to be a bat. Can we know what it's like to be a human being?

37:33.600 --> 37:41.520
Can you say what it's like to be you? I can't say what it's like to be me. I mean, I somehow

37:42.720 --> 37:48.080
experience what it's like to be me, but I can't convey it to you. Maybe somebody can write a poem

37:48.080 --> 37:54.240
about it. Or write a novel. You read novels, it's sort of good literature, sort of gives you some

37:54.240 --> 38:01.280
insight into it. But do we expect to get a scientific answer to what it's like to see?

38:01.280 --> 38:08.000
What it feels like to see the color red? I don't see any reason to believe it.

38:08.000 --> 38:13.920
What I can say, Noam, is what it feels like to have this conversation with you is just wonderful.

38:13.920 --> 38:20.480
I'm sorry, we're probably out of time. But that inner feeling that in my consciousness,

38:20.480 --> 38:24.480
this has been a great experience for me. So thank you very much.

38:25.600 --> 38:30.560
