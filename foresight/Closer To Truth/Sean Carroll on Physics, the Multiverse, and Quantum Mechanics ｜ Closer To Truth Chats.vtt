00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
I would like to be able to understand why the laws of physics look the way they do,

00:06.160 --> 00:12.240
but as in terms of why the universe exists, I think that will probably just turn out to be

00:12.240 --> 00:17.920
an ill-formed question. I think that there's no such thing as the reason why the universe exists.

00:18.160 --> 00:32.160
Welcome to Closer to Truth. I'm speaking with physicist and philosopher of physics,

00:32.160 --> 00:39.360
Sean Carroll, about his superb, valuable new book, Quanta and Fields, the second in Sean's

00:39.360 --> 00:44.400
acclaimed series, The Biggest Ideas in the Universe. It is the clearest introduction to

00:44.480 --> 00:51.040
quantum mechanics and related topics with the real math that is both comprehensive and accessible,

00:51.040 --> 00:56.800
which sounds like an oxymoron, but for Sean it is not. Sean, good to see you again.

00:57.440 --> 01:00.000
Robert, thanks very much for having me on. Always good to be here.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.040
I love the book. It's what I've been looking for. I learned a lot. I need to learn more,

01:05.040 --> 01:11.760
but before we dive in, let's start with one of the possible implications of quantum theories,

01:11.760 --> 01:16.720
the many-worlds interpretation, which we'll talk about later in depth, but just briefly,

01:16.720 --> 01:23.040
because I read in the April 9th issue of New Scientist Magazine an article that headlines

01:23.040 --> 01:30.160
the multiverse could be much, much bigger than we ever imagined, and it considers innumerable

01:30.160 --> 01:36.720
subsystems of the world. You're quoted quite extensively, quite well, as taking this seriously.

01:36.720 --> 01:41.200
Why do you take that seriously? Well, many worlds in general is a wonderful

01:41.200 --> 01:46.720
and compelling idea. I take it seriously because it's the most straightforward implication of

01:46.720 --> 01:52.480
the equations of quantum mechanics, in particular the Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics.

01:52.480 --> 01:57.680
Every other version of the foundations of quantum mechanics either changes the Schrodinger equation

01:57.680 --> 02:02.800
sometimes or adds new elements to it or something like that. Let me just be super duper clear for

02:02.800 --> 02:07.120
the listeners. I wrote a whole book about the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics

02:07.120 --> 02:12.560
and why it's good. In these books and the biggest ideas, I don't talk about it that much. I'm much

02:12.560 --> 02:18.080
more focused on what we truly believe that we understand, not speculations that go beyond

02:18.080 --> 02:23.440
our current knowledge. Right. No, that's clear from the book. But in the article, it talks about

02:23.440 --> 02:29.680
the idea of subsystems where any two aspects of the world, what I'm doing here on Earth and

02:29.680 --> 02:35.760
something that just happened in an Alpha Centauri, could be looked upon as a subsystem. Does that in

02:35.760 --> 02:42.160
any way expand the traditional Hugh Everett, traditional interpretation of many worlds?

02:42.160 --> 02:46.160
Because that was the implication of the article. Well, I think that it depends on what you mean

02:46.160 --> 02:51.760
by the interpretation. At its very most basic level, Everett is just saying there is something

02:51.760 --> 02:57.760
called the quantum state, which everyone agrees there is, the vector in Hilbert space, if you

02:57.760 --> 03:02.240
want to be technical about it, but the wave function of the universe, if you want to be poetic.

03:02.800 --> 03:07.200
And it always obeys the Schrodinger equation. That's it. That's the entirety of the

03:07.200 --> 03:13.840
interpretation. Everything else is commentary, including the fact that there are many worlds.

03:13.840 --> 03:19.760
And so there is a long running debate among people who care about the Everett interpretation

03:19.760 --> 03:25.280
about what counts as a world. Where do we draw the dividing line between the different worlds?

03:25.360 --> 03:31.600
And so we're thinking about the possibility that you can be pretty comprehensive in dividing it up

03:31.600 --> 03:37.040
into a very large number of worlds. But the important thing is this doesn't change the

03:37.040 --> 03:42.720
Everett interpretation at all. It's only a question of, is this more a more convenient

03:42.720 --> 03:47.840
way of thinking about it for we limited human beings? Okay, well, there'll be more to come

03:47.840 --> 03:52.720
of many worlds. We'll get into it later in more depth, but it is certainly fascinating.

03:52.720 --> 03:56.960
We'll conduct our discussion in three parts. First, I want to go through each chapter of the

03:56.960 --> 04:02.400
book just to get an overall high level sense of quantum fields. Then I'm going to pick out

04:02.400 --> 04:08.720
several of what I think are interesting issues from the book that we can discuss in some depth.

04:08.720 --> 04:13.120
And then finally, we'll have sort of some speculations about the implications of

04:13.120 --> 04:17.680
quantum mechanics and the nature of reality, all good, close to the true subject. But first,

04:17.680 --> 04:26.240
let me give a serious quick bio. Sean Carroll is the Homewood Professor of Natural Philosophy at

04:26.240 --> 04:31.680
Johns Hopkins University, a joint appointment between physics and philosophy. Sean's research

04:31.680 --> 04:37.920
has focused on cosmology, field theory, and gravitation, shifting to more foundational

04:37.920 --> 04:42.960
questions in quantum mechanics. In addition to the biggest ideas in the universe series,

04:42.960 --> 04:48.720
he is the author of many bestselling books, including Something Deeply Hidden, The Big Picture,

04:48.720 --> 04:55.840
and From Eternity to Now. He is the host of the popular Mindscape podcast. Sean, lots to cover.

04:56.480 --> 05:02.880
Again, we're going to use the chapters of your book as a framework. So let's look for a high-level

05:02.880 --> 05:10.480
discussion in the overview, which is just to give some fundamentals. Just define a quanta and fields

05:10.480 --> 05:20.480
by contrasting it with what we know from classical physics. Yeah, you know, it's a three-volume series

05:20.480 --> 05:25.280
that we're in the middle of here. Volume one was space, time, and motion, classical physics.

05:25.280 --> 05:30.560
Volume two is quantum physics, but that has to include modern ways of thinking about quantum

05:30.560 --> 05:34.880
physics, which are based on quantum field theory. So a lot of the book is about quantum field theory.

05:35.840 --> 05:44.880
Okay, and what is the major contrast between quanta and field? So define each of those terms

05:44.880 --> 05:52.640
briefly. The idea of quanta comes from the fact that we actually, in the formulation of the theory,

05:52.640 --> 05:58.800
quantum mechanics, we don't think about a lattice or discreteness or pixels or anything like that.

05:58.800 --> 06:03.760
Everything is smooth and continuous, but when we observe it, the world appears to us in lumps,

06:03.760 --> 06:10.400
in particles, which we call quanta, and fields are the fact that the thing that we quantize

06:10.400 --> 06:15.200
to get our best picture of nature are fields that fill all of space rather than particles

06:15.200 --> 06:19.440
that have a definite location. Okay, and that's a very significant point. A major part of the book

06:19.440 --> 06:25.840
and we'll get into that. Okay, chapter one is on the wave function, giving the position and

06:25.840 --> 06:31.920
momentum of every constituent, specifies a classical system, and giving the wave function

06:31.920 --> 06:38.320
specifies the quantum state of a system. Yeah, this was a dramatic change because Isaac Newton,

06:38.320 --> 06:44.000
we thought, had laid down the law for classical mechanics. What the world is, is some things

06:44.000 --> 06:49.680
with positions and momenta. Quantum mechanics comes along and says, no, there's something called the

06:49.680 --> 06:55.840
wave function, and we can figure out how to predict things as best we can from it, but it's an utterly

06:55.840 --> 07:04.000
different thing than Newton would have thought. And for the wave function, that is not designed

07:04.000 --> 07:12.320
as a representation of reality. It means it is reality. It's a big difference in science.

07:12.320 --> 07:18.640
We don't agree. No one knows. I think that reality is completely represented by the wave function.

07:18.640 --> 07:24.320
In other words, reality is reality, but the wave function is in a mathematical one-to-one

07:24.320 --> 07:29.760
correspondence with reality. Others think that it's only part of reality or it has nothing to do

07:29.760 --> 07:35.600
with reality. So that's where opinions differ. Okay, sounds like a big difference. So you bring

07:35.600 --> 07:41.760
up the Schrodinger equation very briefly. Describe it. The Schrodinger equation is what replaces

07:41.760 --> 07:47.840
in quantum mechanics f equals ma from classical mechanics, the equation of motion Newton's second

07:47.840 --> 07:52.560
law. It's the thing that says, okay, I've told you what the world is. Newton would have said

07:52.560 --> 07:58.320
positions in momentum. Quantum mechanics says it's a wave function. Now tell me how it evolves,

07:58.320 --> 08:01.840
how it changes over time. That's what the Schrodinger equation does.

08:01.840 --> 08:06.720
Great. And one other point from this chapter, which comes out as important, is when you use the

08:06.720 --> 08:12.560
Hamiltonian, which you discussed in your first book, in quantum mechanics, that becomes an operator.

08:12.560 --> 08:19.280
And so give us just some sense of what an operator is in terms of a mathematical function

08:19.280 --> 08:24.720
that characterizes quantum mechanics versus classical mechanics.

08:25.280 --> 08:29.680
Yeah. So I was happy enough in book one to talk about something called the Hamiltonian,

08:29.680 --> 08:34.960
which is a fancy way of saying the energy of a system as a function of the positions and

08:34.960 --> 08:40.560
momenta of everything. So you have some complicated arrangement of stuff. And the Hamiltonian is

08:40.560 --> 08:46.000
one number. It's the energy of that particular arrangement of stuff. In quantum mechanics,

08:46.080 --> 08:51.760
the Hamiltonian, like many other things, is not a number. It's an operator, which means I start

08:51.760 --> 08:58.320
with a wave function with some quantum mechanical state. And the Hamiltonian operates on that to

08:58.320 --> 09:02.720
give me a different wave function. And then I can do things with it like plug it into the Schrodinger

09:02.720 --> 09:08.160
equation. Good. So that's a very significant difference. Okay. Chapter two is on measurement.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.520
Let's start very quickly is what is the measurement problem?

09:12.480 --> 09:16.560
Well, this is the big thing for the foundations of quantum mechanics, right? Because

09:17.360 --> 09:23.120
if all that had happened when we invented quantum mechanics was to replace positions and momenta

09:23.120 --> 09:27.120
with wave functions, that would be slightly annoying, but we would deal with it waves are

09:27.120 --> 09:33.200
things that physicists know how to deal with very, very well. The problem is that when you look at

09:33.200 --> 09:37.360
a quantum system, it doesn't look like a wave function. It looks like particles or something

09:37.360 --> 09:43.200
like that. So the measurement problem is, what do you mean when you say look at a system? What

09:43.200 --> 09:49.840
exactly happens? What counts as a measurement? What can make it happen? What kind of agents can

09:49.840 --> 09:56.240
make it happen? Why are measurements important at all? Yeah, and many people extrapolate that

09:56.240 --> 10:02.320
significantly to say there has to be a conscious observer. And this has great philosophical

10:02.320 --> 10:09.520
implications about the nature of reality or the nature of consciousness, which I don't think we

10:09.520 --> 10:14.640
agree with. Well, I don't agree with it. I'm not going to put words in anyone else's. Well, I think

10:14.640 --> 10:21.200
we mean you and I. Yeah, right. So, you know, we don't know what the answer to this measurement

10:21.200 --> 10:26.720
problem is, but it's not that we have no good ideas. We have lots of good ideas. And what we

10:26.800 --> 10:33.440
teach our students is not very good, is not very sensible, is not very coherent. It's just that

10:33.440 --> 10:38.480
when you measure something, the wave function suddenly changes, it collapses. But you're not

10:38.480 --> 10:43.360
allowed to ask what it means to do a measurement, to what counts as a measurement. So it's good

10:43.360 --> 10:48.320
enough. That sort of half baked version of quantum mechanics is good enough to win many,

10:48.320 --> 10:53.360
many Nobel Prizes. But it's not quite precise and clear enough to be a well formulated theory of

10:53.360 --> 10:58.240
reality. In this chapter, just give some sense of what Hilbert space is and how that compares

10:58.240 --> 11:02.720
with regular space and why that's important in quantum mechanics. Yeah, it's too bad that the

11:02.720 --> 11:09.040
word space is used here. And I blame the mathematicians for this. They consider any set

11:09.040 --> 11:14.800
with interesting structures on it to be called a space, right? So the space of all possible,

11:14.800 --> 11:21.280
blah, blah, blah, very different than the three dimensional space that you and I live in. So Hilbert

11:21.280 --> 11:26.880
space is the mathematical space where all of the wave functions live. Every possible quantum state

11:26.880 --> 11:33.280
of the universe is an element of Hilbert space. And John von Neumann, the famous physicist and

11:33.280 --> 11:39.280
mathematician, showed that mathematically, Hilbert space is a vector space. That means that

11:39.280 --> 11:43.760
quantum states are vectors. You can add them together. You can, they have a direction, they

11:43.760 --> 11:48.720
have a magnitude. They don't have a direction in physical space in the three dimensional world.

11:48.800 --> 11:53.520
They have a direction in this gigantically dimensioned thing called Hilbert space.

11:54.320 --> 12:00.800
Chapter three entanglement. A very interesting point you make is that when we think classically,

12:00.800 --> 12:07.200
we think particles. And when we think in quantum, we first think of the quantum state, then particles.

12:08.320 --> 12:12.560
Yeah. And importantly, when you have more than one particle in classical mechanics,

12:12.560 --> 12:18.400
it's not a big deal. You just add more particles. You describe each particle individually. The

12:18.480 --> 12:24.720
classical world is separable. You can treat each part of it all by itself and then add in what

12:24.720 --> 12:30.800
its interactions are with the rest of the world. Entanglement in quantum mechanics says the quantum

12:30.800 --> 12:35.840
world is not like that. There are not separate quantum states for different parts of the universe.

12:35.840 --> 12:42.240
There is only one wave function for the whole universe all at once. And that has important

12:42.240 --> 12:48.320
experimental implications. You can measure one part of the universe and that tells you something

12:48.320 --> 12:50.480
about the possible measurement outcomes somewhere else.

12:51.840 --> 12:57.600
Chapter four is on fields, a very important part of the book because quantum field theory,

12:58.320 --> 13:04.160
as you state, is the single best way to describe the universe at its deepest known level. So

13:04.160 --> 13:09.760
quantum field theory really becomes the foundation out of which quantum mechanics and

13:10.640 --> 13:16.320
particles emerge. Yeah. And I want to emphasize there's 12 chapters in the book and only three

13:16.320 --> 13:22.000
of them are about quantum mechanics by itself. We move very quickly onto fields because it's such

13:22.000 --> 13:28.160
a rich, amazingly deep subject. And so in this chapter, chapter four, we just make our lives

13:28.160 --> 13:33.040
very, very simple. We say, what if there was just one field in the universe and it didn't interact

13:33.040 --> 13:38.240
with anything else? It's all by itself. And what we show is that when you apply the rules of

13:38.240 --> 13:45.360
quantum mechanics to that situation, that field acts like a collection of particles or

13:45.360 --> 13:50.720
more specifically, because quantum mechanics lets us consider super positions of different

13:50.720 --> 13:56.880
things like Schrodinger's cat being partly awake and partly asleep. You can have a quantum field

13:56.880 --> 14:03.520
representing zero particles and also one particle and also two particles, etc. all the way up all at

14:03.520 --> 14:12.480
once. And significantly, then particles are really the quantized excitation of fields as opposed to

14:13.440 --> 14:18.160
entities in themselves. This is, I think, one of the most fundamental points.

14:18.800 --> 14:24.400
Absolutely. It surely is. As I say in the book, if you were a physicist working at the end of

14:24.400 --> 14:30.000
the 1800s, you would have been forgiven for thinking we were almost done with physics.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.520
Classical mechanics seemed pretty good. And you could divide the world into particles and fields,

14:35.520 --> 14:41.120
particles like electrons or atoms, fields like the electromagnetic field, the gravitational field,

14:41.120 --> 14:49.680
and so on. And quantum field theory unifies all of that. It's all fields. But when you look at

14:49.680 --> 14:54.960
fields, when you measure them in precisely the right way, they appear to us as particles. So

14:54.960 --> 15:01.120
it's really only one thing going on deep down. So the implication that particles are quantized

15:01.120 --> 15:09.600
excitation of fields answers a fundamental question with all the number of electrons in the

15:09.600 --> 15:16.240
universe or protons 10 to the 80 or whatever the number is. How could they all be exactly the same?

15:17.600 --> 15:23.840
Because it just seems impossible. But when you think of them as not as entities that we have to

15:23.840 --> 15:30.160
explain why they're all the same, but they're all the product of a field, the answer becomes obvious.

15:31.200 --> 15:35.920
You know, you're right. There are about 10 to the 80th electrons in the observable universe. You

15:35.920 --> 15:40.160
got the right number there. I'm very impressed. That was very nice. And you're also right that

15:40.160 --> 15:45.680
the reason why every electron is identical to every other electron is because fundamentally,

15:45.680 --> 15:50.560
the world is not made of electrons or other particles. It's made of fields. And there's

15:50.560 --> 15:56.400
something called the electron field. And when you poke at it and make a little vibration,

15:56.400 --> 16:01.680
that shows up to us as an electron particle. But the underlying field has the same physical

16:01.760 --> 16:06.720
properties no matter when or where you are in the universe. So every electron looks identical

16:06.720 --> 16:12.880
to us. And not only look, but they actually are. They actually are. And quantum mechanics has

16:12.880 --> 16:20.080
a lot to say about that. Yes. Chapter five interactions. Well, of course, this is where

16:20.080 --> 16:25.440
things truly become exciting and mind bending. Because in the previous chapter, we show that

16:25.440 --> 16:30.560
if you had just one field all by itself, not interacting with anything, it would look like

16:30.560 --> 16:34.800
particles. But there's nothing to look at it, right? In order to look at it, you need other

16:34.800 --> 16:40.320
fields interacting with it. And that's where we get to talk about Feynman diagrams. Feynman was

16:40.320 --> 16:46.640
the one who really showed us how to think about interacting quantum fields. Two electrons come

16:46.640 --> 16:52.160
close together. They interact by tossing back and forth some photons or some other particles.

16:52.160 --> 16:57.760
They scatter off to go elsewhere. Sometimes the answer is infinity, which worries you. That'll

16:57.760 --> 17:03.600
be another chapter. But the point is, there's a recipe for going from some specific kind of

17:03.600 --> 17:09.920
interactions that you specify dynamically to all these little pictures of what happens,

17:09.920 --> 17:13.600
which gives you a way of calculating your quantum mechanical probabilities.

17:14.240 --> 17:26.560
On a simple look, Feynman diagrams just seem almost Lego simplistic. Why are they so powerful

17:26.640 --> 17:32.320
when they look so simple? Well, that's a great question. One of the motivations behind writing

17:32.320 --> 17:38.960
this book is to move beyond the idea that Feynman diagrams are just cartoons. Because in a book

17:38.960 --> 17:45.920
like this, my grand ambition is to show people the equations, to unveil the specific quantitative

17:45.920 --> 17:52.000
relationships beneath the metaphors and analogies that we usually get. So in a traditional popular

17:52.000 --> 17:57.040
science treatment, including ones that I've given myself, you will draw a Feynman diagram and you'll

17:57.040 --> 18:02.000
say, this represents this interaction, blah, blah, blah. But you're left a little unsatisfied,

18:02.000 --> 18:07.440
because why do I have to draw that diagram? So here in this book, we explain that every diagram

18:07.440 --> 18:14.560
is a number. Diagrams can be used to calculate quantum mechanical amplitudes, basically to

18:14.560 --> 18:20.560
calculate the wave function for this particular process. And from that, we can get the probability

18:20.560 --> 18:26.720
of observing that process. So they're not just cute little pictures of what happens.

18:26.720 --> 18:32.320
They're fiercely quantitative ways of measuring and characterizing the probability that something

18:32.320 --> 18:38.400
happens. Chapter six, effective field theory. This is my favorite chapter. I don't know if it's

18:38.400 --> 18:42.720
going to be anybody else's favorite chapter, but you know, we alluded to the fact that these

18:42.720 --> 18:47.920
Feynman diagrams, which are supposed to help us calculate things, can easily lead to trouble

18:47.920 --> 18:53.680
because you calculate a number and the number is infinity. And this seems bad. And so Feynman

18:53.680 --> 18:58.000
and Schwinger and Tom and Aga won the Nobel Prize for wrestling with this, showing us that we could

18:58.000 --> 19:04.000
get away with it. But it always seemed a little unsatisfying, the process called renormalization.

19:04.880 --> 19:08.560
Feynman himself was not happy with renormalization throughout his life.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.960
It just sounds like a fudge factor.

19:11.680 --> 19:18.560
It does sound like that. But basically, it was all figured out by Ken Wilson in the 60s and 70s.

19:18.560 --> 19:24.720
And somehow the world doesn't know about this and the world should know about this. What Wilson said

19:24.720 --> 19:30.320
is that the reason why Feynman diagrams give you infinity is because you're including particles

19:30.320 --> 19:34.960
with infinitely big energies. And you don't know what's going on when particles have infinitely

19:35.040 --> 19:41.760
big energies. Maybe space time doesn't exist or something like that. So he showed us how to just

19:41.760 --> 19:48.320
remove those unwanted, ill understood parts from our Feynman diagrams. And we are left with what

19:48.320 --> 19:53.840
is called an effective field theory, because they are very, very effective. Chapter seven,

19:53.840 --> 20:00.640
which is one of my favorite chapters, which you call scale. And you introduce the idea of scale

20:00.640 --> 20:07.120
by saying the number of nucleons of basic Newtonian protons in various orders of magnitude.

20:07.840 --> 20:12.960
Human DNA or bacterium would have 10 to the 12th. A human being would have 10 to the 28th.

20:12.960 --> 20:20.160
The Earth would have 10 to the 51. The Sun would have 10 to the 57. So that's a million times

20:20.160 --> 20:27.040
more. Exponent of 6 is a million. And so the Earth is roughly a millionth the size of the Sun,

20:27.040 --> 20:33.200
which is right. Milky Way Galaxy, 10 to the 70th. I think that looks like 10 trillion suns,

20:33.200 --> 20:38.400
which is more than the number of stars in the galaxy. But there's a lot of gas and other stuff.

20:38.400 --> 20:43.440
So that's order of magnitude, right? And then the whole observable universe, 10 to the 80th,

20:44.480 --> 20:53.280
which is 10 billion galaxies, seems actually low. Because I think that now 10 trillion,

20:53.600 --> 21:00.240
maybe it should be 10 to the 82nd. But you see this beautiful hierarchy. And to me, that's the

21:00.240 --> 21:06.720
best, simplest way to get a sense of the structure of reality. I mean, it's literally breathtaking.

21:07.600 --> 21:12.960
Yeah, you know, this chapter is kind of a reward. It's a little respite. You know,

21:12.960 --> 21:15.840
you've just done the last couple of chapters, you're pretty heavy going.

21:16.560 --> 21:23.920
Yeah, it's a lot. And so we want to like put it together. And as you see, as you say,

21:24.800 --> 21:30.240
reflect on the beautiful structure that comes out of this, because this talk about quantum

21:30.240 --> 21:35.520
mechanics and field theory, sometimes it said, this describes the world of the very small,

21:35.520 --> 21:40.240
but actually describes the whole world, including the very big, he says, you don't need it to describe

21:40.240 --> 21:44.960
most features of galaxies or stars. You need it when you get down to subatomic particles,

21:44.960 --> 21:47.840
but they all fit in to the quantum field theory framework.

21:48.400 --> 21:56.320
An interesting point in this chapter, which is a great way to understand how the world works,

21:56.320 --> 22:02.800
is the fact that we know that that protons and neutrons are made up of quarks, three quarks,

22:02.800 --> 22:10.320
different colors or characteristic strangeness. And they come together in different ways. And

22:10.400 --> 22:17.840
we think that's what composes it. And they're held together with the boson, the force of gluons.

22:17.840 --> 22:24.640
But the point that you make, which is the critical point, is that if you took out all the quarks,

22:25.280 --> 22:31.680
and only had the equivalent masses of the of the of the force, which is the gluons,

22:31.680 --> 22:37.440
the total mass wouldn't get that much less. I mean, that's a that's an astounding idea.

22:37.520 --> 22:44.800
Yeah, you know, this is why it's necessary and useful to think about quantum field theory, because

22:45.600 --> 22:50.320
sometimes when you have an electron going through your bubble chamber or whatever,

22:50.320 --> 22:53.920
you don't need to think about the details of quantum field theory. You can just think of

22:53.920 --> 23:00.320
it as a particle moving in a certain trajectory. But inside a proton or a neutron, the world is

23:00.320 --> 23:06.800
very different from the world of our intuition of particles and so forth. So we're told once again,

23:06.800 --> 23:13.680
in the pop science level, that a proton has three quarks inside. But the mass of the proton is much

23:13.680 --> 23:19.760
bigger than the sum of the masses of those quarks. And also another thing that I go through in the

23:19.760 --> 23:25.680
book is there's something called the Compton wavelength of a particle, which is roughly, you

23:25.680 --> 23:31.760
know, the size you can squeeze its wave function down to. And the Compton wavelength of a quark

23:31.760 --> 23:37.520
is much bigger than the size of the proton that it squeezed into. So what is going on here?

23:37.520 --> 23:41.280
And the answer is that you should read the book because it's all about quantum field theory and

23:41.280 --> 23:45.440
all does make sense. Okay, so now I'm going to go quickly through some of the later chapters.

23:45.440 --> 23:50.720
Eight is symmetry. Symmetry is very important, you know, whenever you hear things like the

23:50.720 --> 23:57.280
standard model is an SU three cross SU two cross you one gauge theory. What do all of those symbols

23:57.280 --> 24:01.600
mean? What do all those words mean? It's all about symmetry and group theory. And that's

24:01.600 --> 24:07.120
why I explained this in the book. Chapter nine is gauge theory, which is a particular kind of field

24:07.120 --> 24:13.680
theory. That's right. So the previous chapter was about the mathematics of symmetry. Gauge theories

24:13.680 --> 24:20.000
are putting that mathematics to work in quantum field theory. It is the existence of certain

24:20.000 --> 24:26.160
kinds of symmetries gauge symmetries that give rise to the forces of nature. The reason why there

24:26.160 --> 24:32.000
are forces is because of a symmetry in the underlying quantum field theory. And this transformation

24:32.000 --> 24:39.520
can be done at every at any point in space time. That's what the word gauge means in gauge symmetry.

24:39.520 --> 24:45.280
It means that I have red, green and blue quarks, for example, that's a three dimensional space,

24:45.280 --> 24:51.040
and I can rotate it. That's a symmetry in SU three symmetry, but I can rotate it separately at every

24:51.040 --> 24:57.440
point in space time. And that means I need a new field to be able to connect them. That field

24:57.440 --> 25:02.160
turns out to be the glue on which holds particles together. One of the points you made out a little

25:02.160 --> 25:12.160
difficulty with is from gauge theory, you can derive the idea that the force carrying particles

25:12.160 --> 25:21.040
are naturally massless like the like the photon, etc. I didn't quite get that. How you how you so

25:21.040 --> 25:27.360
quickly get to that conclusion, which is obviously important. Yeah, it is. So we talk about in earlier

25:27.360 --> 25:33.600
chapters, what it looks like when a field has a mass, it all comes down to the dynamics of the field,

25:33.600 --> 25:39.440
it's a way for the field to interact with itself, so that its particles move slower than the speed

25:39.440 --> 25:44.480
of light and have what we would call a mass, the more force you put on them, the more they accelerate

25:44.480 --> 25:50.480
like F equals MA in Newton's laws. Now gauge symmetries come along, and there's a symmetry there

25:50.480 --> 25:56.800
which very, very tightly restricts the possible terms you can write down in the equations of

25:56.800 --> 26:03.040
motion for these particles. And it turns out that the particular kind of interaction you need

26:03.040 --> 26:09.440
to give those particles a mass is forbidden by the symmetry. It would break the symmetry if you

26:09.440 --> 26:13.520
just naively wrote it down. Well, you can write it down, people did, and they're like, ah, now it's

26:13.520 --> 26:20.000
not gauge invariant anymore. So that symmetry not only gives rise to a new force, but it implies

26:20.000 --> 26:25.200
that the particles carrying that force should be massless, whether they're photons or gravitons

26:25.200 --> 26:32.400
or gluons. Chapter 10 phases. This is a big one because I just told you that gauge symmetries

26:32.480 --> 26:38.640
imply that force carrying particles are massless. But in nature, we have things called the WNZ

26:38.640 --> 26:44.400
bosons, which are force carrying particles which are not massless. What's going on with that?

26:44.400 --> 26:49.120
And the answer is that gauge theories can appear in different phases, very analogous to like the

26:49.120 --> 26:55.360
phases of water being ice or liquid or vapor. There's different ways to apparently break the

26:55.440 --> 27:02.800
symmetry, not really break it, but hide it. And that gives masses to the WNZ bosons, not to mention

27:02.800 --> 27:09.360
particles like the electron and the quarks. I'm very familiar, most people are with the standard

27:09.360 --> 27:18.080
model of particle physics. Stephen Weinberg, particularly, is personifies that you introduced

27:18.080 --> 27:25.760
the idea or explained the idea of core theory as well. So how does the standard model articulate

27:25.760 --> 27:31.680
with core theory? I borrowed that term from Frank Wilczek, who introduced it. And it's basically

27:31.680 --> 27:38.960
a way of reminding you that gravity is less of a bad fit than you might think. We have this thing,

27:38.960 --> 27:44.640
we say, we don't understand quantum gravity, etc., etc. What would be more accurate to say

27:44.640 --> 27:50.240
is that we don't have a full, complete, final theory of quantum gravity. We don't have a theory

27:50.240 --> 27:56.400
of quantum gravity that includes black holes or the big bang or things like that. But as long as

27:56.400 --> 28:02.080
gravity is relatively weak, like all the solar system, including the sun, the earth, etc.,

28:02.080 --> 28:07.120
we're nowhere near making a black hole. Gravity is pretty weak. Under those circumstances,

28:07.120 --> 28:13.360
we understand quantum gravity fine. So the core theory is just the standard model of particle

28:13.360 --> 28:20.080
physics plus gravity in that weak field regime. Okay, so the standard model is a subset of core

28:20.080 --> 28:27.520
theory with the asterisk that this applies to low levels of gravity. Yeah, that's exactly right.

28:27.520 --> 28:34.800
Okay, good. Okay, chapter 11 on matters, bringing things together. Well, matter could mean almost

28:34.800 --> 28:40.160
anything. But what I took it to mean, but I wanted to explain was why when you have certain kinds of

28:40.160 --> 28:46.720
fields, bosons, like the Higgs boson or the photon or whatever, they can pile on top of each other

28:46.720 --> 28:52.800
and give you a classical force field. Whereas other kinds of particles, fermions, like electrons

28:52.800 --> 28:58.720
and neutrinos and quarks, they take up space. They make up matter. The table in front of you or

28:58.720 --> 29:04.160
whatever has a certain solidity, a certain density, because some particles take up space.

29:05.040 --> 29:19.440
I explain why in this chapter. Okay. And that's why my hand don't pass. I can't

29:19.440 --> 29:25.360
indigitate. I can't put my hand through a table. And that's because the difference between the

29:25.360 --> 29:31.280
matter and the forces. The reason why you can punch somebody effectively is ultimately because

29:31.760 --> 29:34.400
electrons do not want to be in the same quantum state. Yes.

29:36.320 --> 29:43.280
Okay, chapter 12, Adams. Yeah. So for the final chapter, we put it all together and we answer

29:43.280 --> 29:48.240
the question, if there's all these particles out there, you know, Higgs bosons and top quarks and

29:48.240 --> 29:55.360
whatever, why are you and I made of so few particles, electrons, protons, neutrons, you know, a couple

29:55.360 --> 30:00.320
of force carrying particles. So we talked about the dynamics of these particles and how they decay

30:00.400 --> 30:06.720
into each other. What are the stable final particles? Why do neutrons become stable inside

30:06.720 --> 30:12.000
a nucleus, but not outside a nucleus? How does it all fit together to make up the periodic table

30:12.000 --> 30:19.360
of the elements? And the big question of a baryon asymmetry, where in the early universe,

30:19.360 --> 30:26.640
I think you say there were 10 billion anti baryon particles versus 10 billion plus one

30:26.640 --> 30:33.280
baryon and therefore all the 10 billion canceled out, but the one left over out of 10 billion

30:35.040 --> 30:41.200
becomes the entire universe. That's exactly right. And we don't know why. And I'm going to be very

30:41.200 --> 30:45.920
honest. I'm not going to tell you why in this book, because I'm sticking to things that we know,

30:45.920 --> 30:49.680
that's when we don't know the answer to. Yeah. And that you said it before, but it's an important

30:49.680 --> 30:55.440
point about the book. We have these very speculative ideas. You've dealt with it in other books. But

30:55.440 --> 31:01.840
this book is really the depth of the understanding of what we do know and what we're sure of and

31:01.840 --> 31:07.760
how that works. Okay, let's go into our second part, which is just taking some of the issues that

31:07.760 --> 31:15.760
are just fascinating and dealing. And let's start with wave particle duality. And in particular,

31:15.760 --> 31:22.000
the celebrated double slit experiment. And why is that so important? Yeah, you know, wave particle

31:22.000 --> 31:27.760
duality is honestly overrated. I think Edward Whitten once said, the battle is over, the waves

31:27.760 --> 31:34.560
have won. The world is clearly made of waves. But it appears like particles under certain

31:34.560 --> 31:40.720
circumstances. That's the magic of quantum measurement. What the world is is very wave,

31:40.720 --> 31:45.760
very field like. But under the right circumstances, when you measure something, it looks like a

31:45.760 --> 31:51.760
particle. The double slit experiment is a famous example of that, where you say a single electron

31:51.760 --> 31:57.360
can pass through two slits and interfere with itself. If you really just accept that electrons

31:57.360 --> 32:02.000
are not particles, they're described by wave functions. That's the least surprising thing in

32:02.000 --> 32:08.160
the world. Waves can interfere with each other. Right. And how deeply do we understand that?

32:09.840 --> 32:16.320
Some would speculate that the double split experiment is evidence for the many world

32:16.320 --> 32:20.960
interpretation. You wouldn't go that far, would you? I would not go that far. I think, again,

32:20.960 --> 32:27.680
all you need to believe in is the reality of wave functions. Now, some people don't. Some people

32:27.680 --> 32:31.920
think that wave functions are just ways to calculate experimental outcomes, and we should

32:31.920 --> 32:38.400
not attribute reality to them. And I think that those people have a very difficult time in explaining

32:38.400 --> 32:42.000
things like the double slit experiment. They can do it, but they kind of have to bend over

32:42.000 --> 32:48.160
backwards to do it. So if you just trust the equations, if you just believe what is sitting

32:48.160 --> 32:52.640
right in front of your face, here's a wave function, here's the equation it obeys,

32:52.640 --> 32:56.240
everything, I think, makes perfect sense. I don't think the double slit is especially mysterious.

32:57.280 --> 33:02.560
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is almost a household world and is used in many,

33:02.560 --> 33:09.520
in many forms. One of the highlights of the book to me was understanding it in its deeper meaning

33:10.000 --> 33:16.880
and to really appreciate why it is the case. So give me a brief sense of that.

33:17.680 --> 33:22.240
Yeah, you know, it's, again, not a postulate of quantum mechanics. It's something that pops out

33:22.240 --> 33:27.520
of the formalism of quantum mechanics. But it's fascinating to me because Isaac Newton

33:28.240 --> 33:32.720
in his formulation of classical mechanics says very clearly, you need to tell me

33:32.720 --> 33:37.920
the position of something and its momentum, and then I can predict where it will go. The state

33:37.920 --> 33:43.520
of something is its position and its momentum. Quantum mechanics comes along and says my wave

33:43.520 --> 33:50.160
function is psi of x. That is to say, for every possible position of the particle,

33:50.160 --> 33:55.120
I can attach a wave function number and I would square that to get the probability of observing

33:55.120 --> 34:01.440
it. So where did P go? What happened to momentum? P is the letter that we use for momentum. How can

34:01.440 --> 34:08.000
you possibly capture everything there is about the system in terms of just the wave function

34:08.000 --> 34:11.920
as a function of position? So I explain the answer to that. We know what the answer is.

34:12.480 --> 34:18.240
And the answer is, remember, quantum states are vectors in Hilbert space. And basically,

34:18.240 --> 34:23.680
when you have a vector, if you just do have x, y, and z, then you have components of the vector.

34:23.680 --> 34:27.920
You've chosen a basis. You're going to tell me what the vector is by giving you the components.

34:28.560 --> 34:34.960
In quantum mechanics, the relationship between position and momentum is changing bases,

34:35.600 --> 34:41.680
changing the fundamental axes along which you measure your vector. And then if you believe that,

34:41.680 --> 34:47.120
if position is one kind of basis, momentum is a different kind of basis, the uncertainty

34:47.120 --> 34:51.120
principle is automatically true. It's almost trivial. In fact, there are physicists out there

34:51.120 --> 34:55.680
who will say, oh, it's just obvious. You shouldn't be worried about it. Because if you've rotated

34:55.680 --> 35:04.080
your vectors, you can't be completely 100% in a direction in one basis and also complete 100%

35:04.080 --> 35:08.320
along an axis in the different basis because they're rotated with respect to each other. So

35:08.320 --> 35:12.880
that's an example. It's a great example where a little bit of math, I think, makes everything

35:12.880 --> 35:22.240
much, much clearer. And it pops out, as you said. It's a forced realization as opposed to a brilliant

35:22.240 --> 35:27.440
new idea. Yeah. I mean, it was a brilliant new idea when Heisenberg came up with it. But honestly,

35:27.440 --> 35:32.720
we understand quantum mechanics better now than we did in those early days. So it does,

35:32.720 --> 35:36.560
once you understand what quantum mechanics is trying to tell you, the uncertainty principle

35:36.560 --> 35:42.720
just comes along for the ride. You make the statement that entanglement helps us understand

35:42.720 --> 35:49.120
measurement. That was to be one of the most interesting statements in the book. These are two

35:49.120 --> 35:55.840
of the most important aspects of quantum mechanics, obviously, and you link them together. How does

35:55.840 --> 36:01.840
that happen? Yeah, you know, I actually struggled while writing the book with the fact that we

36:01.840 --> 36:06.880
don't agree on the basic language with which to talk about quantum mechanics. We don't agree on

36:06.880 --> 36:13.840
whether wave functions are real or not. And I decided that, you know, rather than on every page

36:13.840 --> 36:17.840
saying, well, if you think this, you would say this thing. And then this, you know, that would

36:17.840 --> 36:23.520
just drag it down. So I said, we're going to talk as if wave functions are real. I happen to think

36:23.520 --> 36:28.320
that they are, I happen to think that is the right way to think about reality. But it certainly

36:28.400 --> 36:34.160
provides a much easier way of talking about what happens in quantum mechanics. And if you accept

36:34.160 --> 36:40.000
that, then we have an answer to the question, what do you mean by doing a measurement? And the

36:40.000 --> 36:44.880
answer is a measurement happens when a quantum mechanical system that again, it can be in a

36:44.880 --> 36:50.720
superposition like spin up and spin down at some fraction of each all by itself. That's fine.

36:51.280 --> 36:57.680
A measurement is when that system becomes entangled with the rest of the world. And that's when

36:57.680 --> 37:02.960
the two parts of the superposition are no longer sort of living by themselves. They're now related

37:02.960 --> 37:08.800
to everything else in the universe. That's what we call a measurement. Okay, you also make the

37:08.800 --> 37:14.000
point we talked about a little bit earlier of the wave function of the universe that and the basic

37:14.000 --> 37:19.520
idea I think is that no matter how you define your system, whether it's, as you said, two particles

37:19.520 --> 37:26.240
or the entire universe, there's still only one wave function of that system. So give me some color

37:26.240 --> 37:31.280
around that. Yeah, you know, this is one of the things that is very, very difficult for people

37:31.280 --> 37:36.960
to wrap their brains around. Because we look at the world around us, we see many separate objects,

37:36.960 --> 37:43.440
that just seems to be pretty obvious. And quantum mechanics, to put it in closer to truth language,

37:43.440 --> 37:48.400
is more of a monist theory. It says there's really only one thing the wave function of the

37:48.400 --> 37:53.200
entire universe. And so people struggle to understand it. But what I would advocate is just

37:53.840 --> 38:00.640
accepting that, accept that there is only one thing and ask the other way, ask, why does this

38:00.640 --> 38:06.320
one thing, the wave function of the universe, appear to us as many things? That's the surprising

38:06.320 --> 38:11.920
thing. Why does it look like apparently the world is made of many separate things? And there,

38:11.920 --> 38:18.240
that's an answerable question. It comes down again to measurement, what we call decoherence,

38:18.320 --> 38:23.200
which is when these quantum systems that are in a superposition become entangled with the rest of

38:23.200 --> 38:29.200
the world. And it all does ultimately make sense, even if it doesn't come close to our everyday

38:29.200 --> 38:35.840
intuitions. What is the hierarchy problem? Well, we mentioned before the core theory, right,

38:35.840 --> 38:41.200
the standard model of particle physics plus gravity. It's a theory that fits essentially

38:41.200 --> 38:45.440
all of the data that we have from laboratory experiments here on earth. It doesn't fit

38:46.000 --> 38:50.240
some things in outer space, which is why we need dark matter and dark energy, etc. But here on

38:50.240 --> 38:56.720
earth, it does a very good job. The problem is, even though it fits the data, there are parameters,

38:56.720 --> 39:03.360
coupling constants, numbers inside the core theory that are very, very surprising, that are not at

39:03.360 --> 39:08.800
all what we would expect if those numbers were just chosen randomly. The hierarchy problem refers

39:08.800 --> 39:14.240
to the fact that there are two parameters. One is the Planck scale, the scale at which gravity

39:14.240 --> 39:20.160
becomes important, okay, 10 to the 18 billion electron volts. And then there is the mass of

39:20.160 --> 39:26.400
the Higgs boson, which tells us the electroweak scale, the scale for particle physics, if you like.

39:26.400 --> 39:33.440
And that's at about 100 billion electron volts. But if you read chapter six on effective field

39:33.440 --> 39:38.880
theory, you will learn that particle physicists see no reason why these two scales should be so

39:38.880 --> 39:44.240
different from each other. You would naturally expect them to be very similar to each other,

39:44.240 --> 39:50.720
and they're different by a factor of 10 to the 16, which is just a little crazy. That's the hierarchy

39:50.720 --> 39:55.600
problem. We still don't know the answer to it. And also, how about the relationship between the

39:55.600 --> 40:04.160
powers of the forces between the electromagnetic and the gravitational power of forces? There's a

40:04.160 --> 40:11.280
huge difference. Once again, if you're just imagining a universe or a world, you wouldn't

40:11.280 --> 40:17.520
think there'd be such a vast difference in scale. Yeah, this is where it becomes very,

40:17.520 --> 40:22.800
very tricky because you have to ask, you know, how do you measure these things? Like, after all,

40:22.800 --> 40:29.600
the electromagnetic force between two neutrons is zero. But the electromagnetic force between

40:29.600 --> 40:36.160
two protons is considerable. Gravity is different because everything is affected by gravity. So

40:36.160 --> 40:41.040
the difference in the strength of the forces is actually not something that physicists spend a lot

40:41.040 --> 40:46.720
of time dwelling on. That's harder to sort of know what your expectations should have been.

40:47.760 --> 40:52.720
There's something called the weak gravity conjecture that conjectures that there are good

40:52.720 --> 40:59.120
reasons why gravity has to be the weakest force. But honestly, that's beyond the scope of the book

40:59.120 --> 41:04.160
here. So we're trying to stick to things in this book that everyone will still agree on 500 years

41:04.160 --> 41:10.560
from now. Good. Well, that's a challenge. But I think that's a very admirable one and that and

41:10.560 --> 41:20.000
very clear in terms of the purpose of the book. In that area of hierarchy, and we have the cosmological

41:20.000 --> 41:27.680
constant, which, as you point out, very strongly is the vacuum energy of empty space, quote, unquote.

41:28.560 --> 41:34.720
But the difference between the calculated theoretical value and the observational value

41:35.600 --> 41:43.600
is, as you say, 10 to the minus 122. So that's 10 to the minus 122 zeros, which is

41:44.400 --> 41:51.440
the largest mismatch in all of physics and all of reality in terms of the relationship between

41:51.440 --> 42:01.200
theory and experimental observation. What does that tell us? Well, we're not sure what it tells

42:01.200 --> 42:06.480
us, to be perfectly honest. Again, this is an open problem. I think that the contribution of a book

42:06.480 --> 42:12.480
like Quantum Fields is that the reader can truly understand the problem in a way that it's harder

42:12.480 --> 42:19.200
to do otherwise. Because once you understand what quantum field theory is, and once you understand

42:19.200 --> 42:25.520
how effective field theory works, now you can follow the argument that says something like

42:25.520 --> 42:32.640
the vacuum energy should be a certain number. Because it's certainly not a clear crisp prediction,

42:32.640 --> 42:37.120
right? We actually don't know what the vacuum energy should be. We have rough back of the

42:37.120 --> 42:43.840
envelope expectations for what it should be. And if it had been off by 10 to the two or 10 to the

42:43.840 --> 42:47.760
three, then we would have dealt with that. We would have rolled with that and said, okay, that's how

42:47.760 --> 42:54.400
the cookie crumbles. But when it's off by 10 to the 122, then we go, you know, I bet there's a reason

42:54.400 --> 43:00.000
why. I bet there's an explanation. I bet this is not just luck, right? And again, I'm not going to

43:00.000 --> 43:05.040
tell you what the answer is in this book, but I'm going to help you appreciate why physicists think

43:05.040 --> 43:10.880
it's a real problem. And the quantum field theory is the foundation of what creates the problem in

43:10.880 --> 43:18.880
a sense. 100%. You know, quantum field theory is super, super, super successful at fitting the

43:18.880 --> 43:27.600
data. Once you put in these incredibly finely tuned, seemingly unnatural parameters for certain

43:27.600 --> 43:34.480
parts of the laws of physics. So it's kind of a weird problem. It's not the usual thing in science

43:34.480 --> 43:39.680
where we have a theory, it makes a prediction, and then the experiment says, no, that's not it.

43:40.400 --> 43:46.080
This is not a place where we have a prediction. We have a feeling, we have vibes, right? And so

43:46.080 --> 43:49.520
the question of how seriously we should take that is a very good one.

43:50.160 --> 43:55.680
Okay, now we go on to part three, which is pure speculation. And so we want to emphasize that

43:55.680 --> 44:03.120
the book gives everyone the the capacity to understand the what is real and what is known

44:03.200 --> 44:12.320
today, and can therefore look at speculative ideas from the found from the unified foundation that

44:12.320 --> 44:18.960
we have of particularly quantum field theory. So what comes now is pure speculation, Sean.

44:20.160 --> 44:26.880
You know, we're just going to just ask your feelings and we'll hold you to them if you want

44:26.880 --> 44:31.520
to change it the next time we talk. So the first one, I've got to go back to the many worlds

44:31.520 --> 44:39.440
interpretation, which you have forcefully and very strongly articulated and advocate.

44:40.160 --> 44:44.960
And I don't want to, obviously, there are differences. There's, you know, pilot wave,

44:44.960 --> 44:49.280
Bohmian mechanical, all sorts of different explanations. But I don't want to put that

44:49.280 --> 44:55.520
aside. I want to say, okay, if the many worlds interpretation is real, if that is the way

44:55.520 --> 45:03.440
reality is, you know, how does it work? I mean, there are 10 to the 80th, the numbers of particles,

45:03.440 --> 45:11.920
maybe 10 to the 90th photons, each one can can be analyzed in terms of the plank time of each one,

45:12.640 --> 45:18.480
and different relationship. How do you deal with the way to even think about the number of worlds?

45:18.480 --> 45:24.080
Is it, you know, 10 to the 80th or 90th factorial in some sense per plank time? I mean,

45:24.160 --> 45:28.880
I just want to get a sense of the, the order of magnitude of how you think about many worlds.

45:29.840 --> 45:34.960
Yeah, I mean, the real answer there is I don't think about all those other worlds that much.

45:34.960 --> 45:40.800
Again, the worlds are a prediction of the theory. They're not what the theory is fundamentally about.

45:40.800 --> 45:47.280
The theory says the world, the total world, the whole universe, what we can see and what we can't

45:47.280 --> 45:52.880
is described by quantum mechanical wave function. And that wave function obeys the Schrodinger

45:52.880 --> 45:57.520
equation. That's the theory. And we're trying to work out the consequences of that theory.

45:58.080 --> 46:03.120
One of the consequences is when you do a quantum mechanical measurement, and again,

46:03.120 --> 46:07.840
measurement can be defined independently of people or consciousness is just about becoming

46:07.840 --> 46:15.280
entangled with the rest of the world. The world branches into multiple somewhat classical looking

46:15.280 --> 46:21.280
parts, the different parts look individually almost classical, but they're separate from each

46:21.280 --> 46:26.480
other because in one the spin was up and the other was the spin was down. I appreciate and

46:26.480 --> 46:31.280
understand all of that. I'm just trying to get a sense of the order of magnitude of the numbers.

46:31.280 --> 46:36.640
If we take, you know, a period of time, one second, could you invite into the plank time,

46:36.640 --> 46:42.800
how many different total worlds emerge from that given the number of the particles in the

46:42.800 --> 46:47.440
observable universe? Right. And I'm trying to convince you to not worry about that. That's the

46:47.520 --> 46:54.880
wrong question to worry about. Let me say two things. Number one, we don't know is the answer

46:54.880 --> 47:01.280
because in order to know that, you would have to know the dimensionality of Hilbert space of the

47:01.280 --> 47:06.560
fundamental theory of everything. And we don't know that right now. Can you give me some boundaries?

47:07.440 --> 47:14.160
I'm trying. I'm trying. It could be infinite, right? For many simple quantum mechanical systems,

47:14.160 --> 47:18.400
the best description is in terms of an infinite dimensional Hilbert space.

47:18.400 --> 47:24.080
And in that case, it would be strictly nonsensical to ask how many worlds are there. It's like

47:24.080 --> 47:30.880
saying how many points are there between zero and one. But what you can do is compare the number of

47:30.880 --> 47:36.560
points between zero and point one to the number of points between zero and one. You can give the

47:36.560 --> 47:42.080
relative amount of worlds with certain qualities and that many worlds is able to do very, very well.

47:42.640 --> 47:48.480
But it's also possible that the magnitude of the dimensionality of Hilbert space is finite.

47:48.480 --> 47:54.640
Indeed, I think that quantum gravity suggests that it probably is finite, at least when you

47:54.640 --> 48:00.000
only consider our observable universe. But the number is very big. The dimensionality of Hilbert

48:00.000 --> 48:07.600
space for observable universe is something like 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 120.

48:08.560 --> 48:12.640
So that's plenty of room for lots of worlds to happen. We're not going to run out of room

48:12.640 --> 48:22.560
anytime soon. So that's a question of the phase space or the capacity, which is obviously 10 to

48:22.560 --> 48:31.280
the 10 to the 120 is enormous. But it doesn't say how many of those occur every period of time.

48:32.240 --> 48:38.640
Can you put a bound on that? If many worlds is correct, within a period of time, one second

48:38.640 --> 48:44.480
take, what is the lower bound and what is the upper bound? Is there any way you can do that?

48:44.480 --> 48:51.120
No, I can't because, again, the theory doesn't talk about worlds. Worlds are things that human

48:51.120 --> 48:58.160
beings invent to talk about the wave function of the universe in a convenient way. Two people

48:58.160 --> 49:03.200
might decide to divide up the wave function of the universe differently. As long as they agree

49:03.200 --> 49:08.160
on what the wave function of the universe is, they're fine. So the question of what is the

49:08.160 --> 49:15.840
number of worlds is just like, what is the number of colors? Okay, let's go on to fine tuning,

49:15.840 --> 49:24.240
which has been extant in physics. It's been extant in science, theology, discussions.

49:25.200 --> 49:30.080
How do you view the fine tuning of the universe, particularly in light of quantum field theory?

49:30.640 --> 49:34.880
Well, I think that the word fine tuning gets bounced around in at least two very, very different

49:34.880 --> 49:41.040
senses. Very often in the popular discourse, it has something to do with life, that the universe

49:41.040 --> 49:48.960
is finely tuned to allow for the existence of life. But physicists will often use the word

49:48.960 --> 49:55.760
fine tuning in a way that has nothing to do with life, just to say that certain parameters,

49:55.760 --> 50:02.720
like the mass of the Higgs boson, for example, in our equations seem to be represented by adding

50:02.720 --> 50:08.640
up many different numbers. And the many different numbers are individually much bigger than the

50:08.640 --> 50:13.520
sum of them that you get for the Higgs boson. And that's not impossible because some of the

50:13.520 --> 50:18.880
numbers are positive and some of the numbers are negative, but somehow they cancel out to give you

50:18.880 --> 50:23.360
a much smaller number than you would expect. And that's fine tuning to a physicist. So I think

50:23.360 --> 50:29.360
that the fine tuning problems of physics are important clues when we're moving forward to try

50:29.360 --> 50:33.280
to understand the laws of physics better. Whether or not they have anything to do with life,

50:33.280 --> 50:39.840
I would not be competent to talk about. And therefore, your feeling is that nobody is competent

50:39.840 --> 50:45.120
to talk about that in a fundamental sense. Well, I'm all in favor of talking about it,

50:45.120 --> 50:50.320
but remaining humble that we don't know the definition of life, the conditions under which

50:50.320 --> 50:55.840
life started, the total set of other possible laws of physics that would allow for life or

50:55.840 --> 50:59.280
anything like that. Yeah, and when we talk about life, that's sort of the end result. I mean,

50:59.280 --> 51:05.360
we're talking about structure to begin with. Why is there any structure at all that seems to be fine

51:05.360 --> 51:10.960
tuned that if various parameters would be off by some argument what it would be, you wouldn't be

51:10.960 --> 51:15.600
able to have any structure at all. Everything would collapse into a black hole or would fly

51:15.600 --> 51:23.680
apart without structure. And why we have this so-called fine tuning. So the question is from

51:23.680 --> 51:30.880
a quantum field theory point of view, is there any color that one can bring to that kind of question?

51:31.760 --> 51:38.800
I don't think that quantum field theory really tells us that much specifically about why and

51:38.800 --> 51:45.280
where and how complex structures can evolve. It gives us the basic ingredients out of which

51:45.280 --> 51:51.680
those complex structures evolve. I will tell you that I have a feeling that a lot of people are

51:51.680 --> 51:58.080
too quick to say that if conditions were different, complex structures would not be able to evolve.

51:58.080 --> 52:03.520
Because guess what? We're very familiar with our conditions. And I don't think that I could hand

52:03.520 --> 52:07.920
most people the standard model of particle physics, and they would successfully predict the

52:07.920 --> 52:14.160
periodic table of the elements, much less life and stars and things like that. So again, I just

52:14.160 --> 52:18.960
want to be humble about the question if things were different, would we even be able to imagine

52:18.960 --> 52:24.880
life coming into existence? I'm just not used to, in our conversations, humility from either one of

52:24.880 --> 52:29.520
us. So it's a little- You've got to grow in your life, right? You've got to try out new things,

52:29.520 --> 52:35.200
put on new hats. I'll take you as a role model and try to follow your humility,

52:36.080 --> 52:44.960
attracting persona. Let's go to some basic, closer-to-truth kinds of questions. We've talked

52:44.960 --> 52:51.520
about it before. We like to ask the question, what exists by which we mean, what are the

52:51.520 --> 52:57.840
fundamental, irreducible categories of reality as few as possible that are irreducible?

52:58.800 --> 53:04.960
Yeah. I mean, of course, I wish I knew the answer to that, but my best guess is a quantum wave

53:04.960 --> 53:10.080
function obeying the Schrödinger equation. I think that people get a little confused because

53:10.080 --> 53:16.400
they will then want to know, well, a wave function of what? When we're taught quantum mechanics,

53:16.400 --> 53:21.920
those of us who went through physics educations, you start with a classical system. Here's a

53:21.920 --> 53:26.240
harmonic oscillator. Here's the electromagnetic field, and then you quantize it, and you get a

53:26.320 --> 53:32.240
quantum theory of that. I think that's a little bit misleading because nature doesn't work that way.

53:32.240 --> 53:38.560
Nature starts quantum mechanical from the beginning. My best guess as the fundamental

53:38.560 --> 53:45.360
thing that exists is some kind of quantum state obeying some kind of Schrödinger equation. Of

53:45.360 --> 53:50.240
course, what exact kind we're still trying to figure out? The other question we ask is, why is

53:50.240 --> 53:54.800
there something rather than nothing? Why anything at all? I can put it in a different way. Is

53:55.760 --> 54:05.280
there are there brute facts beyond which we cannot proceed even in principle? And if so,

54:05.280 --> 54:12.000
what is in that category of brute fact? Yeah, I'm like 99% sure that there are brute facts,

54:12.000 --> 54:17.200
and the existence of the universe itself is one of them. But I don't know exactly which

54:17.200 --> 54:22.880
facts are brute facts and which ones are explicable. I would like to be able to understand why the laws

54:22.880 --> 54:29.680
of physics look the way they do. But in terms of why the universe exists, I think that will

54:29.680 --> 54:36.080
probably just turn out to be an ill-formed question. I think that there's no such thing as

54:36.080 --> 54:42.160
the reason why the universe exists. Okay, that's been great, Sean. I love that again. I recommend

54:42.160 --> 54:48.080
the book for everyone who really wants to understand quantum mechanics and quantum field

54:48.080 --> 54:54.160
theory as the foundation for all these kind of fun questions. So now we have a couple of

54:54.160 --> 54:58.720
short questions, and these are designed for a stream of consciousness. Just give me a

54:59.280 --> 55:04.560
very quick answer, whatever comes to your mind. So the first one is, what do you think the best

55:04.560 --> 55:08.160
theory is to integrate quantum mechanics and general relativity?

55:09.600 --> 55:12.720
Spacetime emerging from entanglement in the wave function.

55:13.440 --> 55:19.600
Question two, roughly, how long do you think it'll be? How many years will it be to get a

55:19.600 --> 55:25.360
general consensus on a theory of everything, whether it's what you just said in terms of

55:25.360 --> 55:28.320
integrating quantum mechanics and general relativity or some other theory? I mean,

55:28.320 --> 55:31.760
do you think this would be what happened in our lifetimes?

55:32.400 --> 55:37.840
I'll say between 50 and 100 years. Okay, here's question three. On a scale of 1 to 10,

55:38.720 --> 55:44.480
your confidence level that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct

55:44.480 --> 55:52.960
and real? 9.5. And next, on a scale of 1 to 10, your confidence level that the standard model of

55:52.960 --> 56:00.320
cosmology, cosmic inflation, the Big Bang, will certainly be refined, but it will not be overthrown.

56:01.520 --> 56:06.480
Well, I would say 9.9, but I do not include inflation in the standard model. That's a speculation.

56:07.280 --> 56:14.400
Okay, last one on a scale of 1 to 10, your confidence level that the physical world is

56:14.400 --> 56:21.360
all there is, that there is no thing that is not physical? 9.99.

56:24.080 --> 56:30.560
Okay, well, your humility may have increased since we began speaking, but your opinion of the

56:30.560 --> 56:36.320
non-physical has not changed. So we can give you consistency as well as humility.

56:38.320 --> 56:44.320
Once again, I love the book. Everybody can learn a great deal from it. I liked how you actually

56:44.320 --> 56:51.680
concluded that to understand the particles we're made of, the forces that we interact,

56:51.680 --> 56:57.040
is one of humanity's greatest achievements, and you have this very beautiful line at the end.

56:57.120 --> 57:00.800
We can all be a little proud of that. So I love that.

57:01.520 --> 57:05.280
Thanks very much. I mean, technically, I concluded with an appendix where I talk about

57:05.280 --> 57:10.480
Fourier transforms, but you're being very nice to talk about the poetic side of the last chapter.

57:10.480 --> 57:13.520
We want to give a little bit of the soft side. Yeah, good.

57:13.520 --> 57:18.720
Once again, Quanten feels indeed the entire, Sean's entire series, the biggest ideas in the

57:18.720 --> 57:25.040
universe, has my highest recommendation. Viewers can watch Sean's 27 videos and

57:25.040 --> 57:32.320
ATV episodes on Closer to Truth, and over 1,500 videos on cosmology and physics,

57:32.320 --> 57:35.760
especially their meaning and implications, not all of which Sean would agree with.

57:36.480 --> 57:41.520
On the Closer to Truth website and Closer to Truth YouTube channel, thanks everyone for watching.

57:41.840 --> 57:50.080
