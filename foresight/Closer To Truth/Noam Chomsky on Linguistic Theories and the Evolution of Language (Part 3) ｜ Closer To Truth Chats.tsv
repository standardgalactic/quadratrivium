0	5440	The language is a core part of human cognition. It's language that constructs thoughts.
6240	7760	That's where thoughts come from.
17280	22080	Welcome to Closer to Truth Chats. Today I'm speaking with Noam Chomsky, the distinguished
22080	28080	theoretical linguist, analytic philosopher, and cognitive scientist who is one of the most cited
28080	34320	living scholars. Closer to Truth is presenting this four-part mini-series with Professor Chomsky.
34320	40320	Part three focuses on the implications of Chomsky's linguistic theories, especially universal
40320	48160	grammar, for human sentient cognition, evolution, and uniqueness. Noam, let's start with how a
48160	54320	universal grammar affects the understanding of human development. You've talked about how a
54320	59040	baby learns language and the importance of a universal grammar.
59040	67600	First of all, let's turn to some things that are now pretty well established by experiment.
69680	78880	There have by now been careful statistical studies of the data available to a young child,
78960	86240	two or three-year-old child, mainly by Charles Yang, a cognitive scientist at the University
86240	94160	of Pennsylvania. Careful analysis, he's shown that it's extremely sparse. There are a lot of words,
94160	100240	but the same words keep repairing over and over. There's a phenomenon, there's a descriptive
100320	110800	phenomenon known as Zipp's law, which shows about the rank frequency distribution of words in a text.
111520	119760	Turns out that some words like the A appear many, many times. As you get to other words,
119760	127120	they appear fewer times. Most words appear maybe once in a long text. Well, that means the actual
127680	135120	data available to a child may be many occurrences of words, but very few words, very few
136480	144560	bigrams, pairs of repeated words, and so on. So the data is very sparse. Studies of language
144560	154880	acquisition, the most exciting of them by Lila Gleitman, a friend and colleague who
155520	162560	passed away a couple of weeks ago, great scientist, her work and other work demonstrated
163280	172480	that children have very impressive linguistic knowledge at a point where they can't exhibit it.
173760	182240	So some of her early work back in the 60s had to do with what's called telegraphic speech.
183040	191200	There's a period in language development. A young child will only use what sounds like
191200	198560	the way telegraphic speech works, only substantive words like want, cookie, let's say, something like
198560	207760	that. That's speech. So it turns out, I won't go through the experiment, but it turns out that
208640	216480	at that age, the child doesn't understand telegraphic speech. It only understands normal speech,
217200	224080	meaning that in its mind, it already has the whole complex system. It's just not producing it.
225200	233360	Turns out that the meanings of words, complex words, are learned with almost maybe one or two
233440	238640	presentations. Somehow it's all in the mind and just comes out when it's triggered.
240560	246160	Things like, take say, again, structure dependence, the principle that I mentioned,
246800	255520	the fact that all operations in all languages depend, keep only to the abstract structure
255520	262880	that the mind creates and ignores the all of the evidence that is presented, linear order.
263520	271520	So from the earliest testable age on through life, we ignore 100% of what we hear
272160	278720	and use only abstract structures that our mind creates. Actually, no way for this to be learned.
278720	287280	It's inconceivable, literally inconceivable. And that means it's just built in. We now have an
287280	294880	understanding of why that actually comes from, is forced by the simplest computational operation.
295680	303600	If you go back to what I said about evolution, some disruptive change takes place. Mother nature
304320	311440	figures out the simplest way of reconstructing the system, accommodating that disruption.
311440	316480	That seems to be what happened with language. Soon as the disruption took place,
317520	325120	the system was created in the simplest possible terms that yields automatically such things as
326640	334240	structural, structure preservation, the other kinds of phenomena I've been describing.
335120	342800	It must also be the explanation for the meanings of words, but there it's mysterious. We don't know
342800	350400	how just whether it happened, but don't know how. Well, what does that tell us about human cognition?
351600	358240	Tells us that probably a very substantial language is a core part of human cognition.
358880	363200	It's language that constructs thoughts. That's where thoughts come from,
364320	372080	any kind of thought that we can comprehend at least is simply basically language. It's what
372080	378640	language produces. So that's a core part of our nature. That's what distinguishes us from other
378640	387520	species, thought and language. And these core parts of our nature seem to be quite substantially
388240	399600	simply built into our nature, shared by all humans, developing through triggering by environmental
399600	406960	stimuli can lead to what look to very different outcomes. But as soon as we look more deeply,
406960	415600	we find that these are surfaced variations based on fundamental similarities. Well, I think that
415680	423360	tells us a good bit about one of the few parts of human cognitive capacity that we know anything
423360	432640	about about the Jerry Fodor great philosopher cognitive scientist that once joked that cognitive
432640	439920	science is the study of vision and language. It's not far from the truth. Language is one
439920	447840	part of it. Vision is another big part of it. Vision works the same way. It turns out that
447840	456480	by now it's understood that very limited stimulation is necessary if an infant,
457200	464480	we don't experiment with infants, but humans have the same visual system as other mammals. So with
464480	473680	other mammals, cats, monkeys, you can show that if you don't present patterned stimulation
474320	481440	in the early days of life, the visual system won't function. It has to be set off by the word
481440	490080	kinds of stimulation. And if you modify the kinds of stimulation, say horizontal lines instead of
490080	496720	vertical lines, it'll affect the way the visual system develops. That's pretty much like language.
497760	505280	It's not the first weeks of life. It's the first year or two of life. The basic system is set one
505280	514560	or another way. And then it just grows out of the nature endowed us with true the visual system.
515360	524640	It's true of ambulatory system, the way you walk and so on. It's true of language. It seems to be
524640	530640	just the way organisms, it's true of other organisms that we know of. So that seems to be
530640	537840	the pretty much the way organisms develop. There are plenty of differences. So we have a
537840	548240	different culture than, say, the Bantu who separated from other humans over 100,000 years ago.
550000	556400	Different culture, but basically the same. If you take an infant from that culture and
557200	564400	raise it in Boston, it'll go to Harvard and become a quantum physicist. Conversely,
565120	571280	it doesn't seem to be any detectable cognitive difference. So there are a lot of things we
571280	578320	learned from this. In the 60, 65, going on 70 years since you've developed the ideas,
578320	584720	particularly the universal grammar, neuroscience in particular, which was my original field,
584720	594320	has mushroomed with ability to do functional NMRs, all different kinds of scanning devices,
594560	602000	plasticity in neuroscience. So as you have seen the development of neuroscience over these decades,
602640	613760	how do some of the structural concepts relate to the abstract ideas of hierarchical structural
613760	621680	building in the language system? Because your ideas with these kind of cognitive concepts,
622320	633280	which has to be instantiated in brain tissue. So how has neuroscience affected or confirmed or
633280	643040	questioned the cognitive ideas that you've had? Well, first of all, let's recognize that the brain
643040	650320	sciences are a very difficult field. First of all, because of the complexity of the brain,
650880	657760	but also for ethical reasons, you cannot do the experiments that come to mind.
658720	668080	You can't do invasive experiments with humans. We know a lot about vision, but that's through
668080	674880	invasive experiments with other animals, which have pretty much the same visual system.
675760	680560	You can't do that with language, because there's no other organism that is any remotely like a
680560	688880	language system. This is unique to humans. So comparative work is out. Direct invasive work
688880	697680	is out. That means the kinds of research you can do are very restricted. So what you're talking
697680	706480	about, which is real, sophisticated, significant, is basically imaging studies where you try to
707440	713680	look at things like rate of blood flow and one or another part of the brain to see what's happening.
716800	724320	You cannot stick an electrode into the language areas of the brain and see what a particular
724320	731040	neuron is doing. You can't, in principle, maybe if you're mangola, you can do it,
731600	740960	but ethical considerations block it. You can't raise a child in a controlled environment to see
740960	747360	what would happen. If you could do that, you could learn a lot about development, but it's
747360	754480	ruled out. So the first point is experimentation is extremely limited, both by complexity,
754480	762400	but simply for ethical reasons. Still, things have been learned, and there are some interesting
762400	769440	results. The most interesting result I know of actually has to do with structured dependence,
770080	779120	the thing I mentioned, the fact that the rules of language don't pay any attention to what we hear
779120	787760	in linear order, but only to abstract structures that the mind constructs. There's experimental work
787760	798320	on this, very interesting. It's done under the design of Andrea Moro, Italian linguist,
798320	805440	whose friend of ours, very good linguist. He designed experiments which were carried out
806800	815760	by an advanced neuroscience group at Milan in Italy, where the design of the experiment is
815760	827120	basically this. You have monolingual subjects, maybe speakers of German, and you develop
827840	834960	invented languages, not real languages, invented ones with kind of like Jabberwocky,
834960	843200	you know, words that don't exist, and have two different kinds of inventive languages.
844080	849920	One of them modeled on a language they don't know, maybe Japanese.
851200	863680	The other, using simple computational operations on linear order. So what will be interpreted
863680	872560	as negation takes the third word in a sentence and makes that the negative particle, very simple
872560	882400	computation. Okay, so give the subjects these two kinds of materials. What he found is that when
882400	892160	you give them materials based on an existing language, the areas of the brain that are involved
892160	899280	in language processing are all lighting up, they're working. When you give them the ones using
900240	907040	simple computations like linear order, you get diffuse brain activity, meaning it's been
907040	915440	being treated as a puzzle, not language. There's actually supporting psycholinguistic evidence.
916800	924320	Neil Smith, a British linguist, fine, British linguist, also a friend, had been working for
924320	934160	many years with a subject who he named Chris. It's a person who has extremely limited cognitive
934160	942160	abilities, almost nothing, but fantastic linguistic capacities. We put a grammar book in front of him
942160	946960	of some language you never heard of, pretty soon he knows the whole language, you know.
947920	954960	He did pretty much the same experiments with Chris. Chris could do nothing with the puzzles,
955600	963360	nothing, just blank stare with the system modeled on an actual language, he just treated it like
963360	971680	any other language. Well, all of this strongly suggests something, that there are brain areas
971680	977200	specifically attuned to language, and they will pick out the structures
979120	987040	and force us to operate the way I've described. We have plenty of other cognitive capacities,
987040	994160	we can solve lots of puzzles, but they seem to be dissociated from language. Now this fits
994160	1001680	with a lot of work that's been done from another direction. Eric Leneberg mentioned earlier,
1002240	1009840	friend of mine in college, one of the three students who were disagreeing with everything
1009840	1017280	when we were grad students at Harvard in the early 50s. He went on to found modern biology of language,
1017920	1025600	and among the topics that he studied were what are called dissociations, people who have a
1025600	1033520	high capacity in one area of cognition, but very little in some other area. So he began to study
1034800	1042240	subjects with good language capacity, but poor cognitive capacities and conversely,
1043120	1050000	similar work. Now that's been extended significantly since one of the main people is
1050800	1058880	Susan Curtis, cognitive scientist at San Diego University in California, has done extensive
1058880	1068560	work on dissociations, and it has pretty much the same results. You find cognitive
1069440	1077040	dissociations in both directions of many kinds. It looks as though language capacity
1077040	1087040	is dissociated from other cognitive capacities. That's one of the reasons why very popular efforts
1087040	1093440	to try to show that language developed out of general cognition, that one reason why they always
1093440	1101680	fail, these are just different capacities. So there is a neuroscience, and this is one example,
1101680	1111680	the best example I know of neuroscientific support for fundamental principles that emerge in
1113600	1118880	the study of language itself and psychology of language. There are other things about
1119840	1126400	hierarchical structure and so on, but it's very difficult to establish because the kinds of work
1126400	1131680	you'd like to do, you just can't do. What can a universal grammar tell us about the evolution
1131680	1137120	of language? Your book with Robert Berwick, Why Only Us, Language and Evolution, really a
1137760	1145440	superb book, deals with the questions. One of the issues that you have is the origin to
1145440	1150320	understand the evolution of language. You have to understand what is language, and the common idea
1150320	1157680	that communication is the function of language, you say, derives from the mistaken belief that
1157680	1165040	language somehow is an evolution of animal communication. You have this radical distinction
1165040	1171840	between human language and systems of animal communication. First of all, we should notice
1171840	1178720	that the common phrase that you repeated, communication is the function of language.
1179280	1186080	It's totally meaningless. Organic systems don't have a function or they have many functions.
1186960	1197120	So what's the function of the spine? Is it to help us stand up? Is it to accumulate calcium?
1197920	1206800	Is it to develop white blood cells? Is it as a casing for a nerve? Actually, it's all of those
1206800	1218320	things. Let's go back to evolution again. First, a disruption takes place, a mutation, symbiosis,
1218960	1225440	some other thing, many things. Then comes the reconstruction stage. Nature
1226480	1233600	tries to make the best of whatever happened. If it was a mutation, try to organize the new system
1233600	1241600	in the best possible way. Then comes the winnowing stage, where among the things that have been
1241600	1248640	created, the more adaptable ones survive natural selection. But at the second stage,
1249600	1255440	nature hasn't the slightest idea what the functions are going to be. It doesn't care about them.
1256000	1263760	It's just finding the best design based on what's around. Now that often leads to highly
1263760	1270320	dysfunctional systems, because it may be that the best thing is not well designed for
1271120	1277680	functions we'd like it to carry out. So for example, during this last year,
1278560	1287840	I've discovered that ears are highly dysfunctional for wearing masks when you have glasses and a
1287840	1294640	hearing aid. It's a horrible pain in the neck. Nature made a terrible mistake and should have had
1294640	1302560	different kind of ears. Well, same's true of the spine. And any engineer could engineer a better
1302560	1308400	system than the spine. But the way it developed over time, this is the best that could be done.
1309040	1315120	So talk about communication being the function of language is, first of all, meaningful.
1316240	1323280	Okay, because language is developed, it's used for many functions. For thinking, for reflection,
1323280	1332080	for many kinds of actions, among them is communication. But the idea that's hidden behind
1332080	1338400	it is what you said, that language somehow evolved from animal communication systems.
1339760	1347680	The evidence is overwhelming that that's not the case. Take even just what I've just suggested,
1347680	1354640	discuss the brief things I've discussed, like structure dependence. There's nothing remotely
1354640	1364400	like it in any animal system. And take the meanings of words, the meaning of river, house, tree,
1364400	1372320	anything. Nothing remotely like it in animal communication. In fact, in animal symbolic
1372320	1380080	systems, the symbols actually do have associations with non-linguistic entities.
1381040	1389840	So if you look at the cries of a monkey, various cries of say, a verbate monkey, there'll be
1390640	1399360	a cry that is made when leaves start moving in a certain way in a tree and all the other monkeys
1399360	1406800	run away. We interpret that as a warning signal. What the monkey's doing, we don't know. But it's
1406800	1412320	interpreted as a warning signal. Maybe there's an eagle up there, the monkey's run away.
1413360	1423760	A hormonal change can lead to a call that basically means I'm hungry. Again, what's
1423760	1432160	going on in the animal's mind, we don't know. But all animal communication systems, the symbols seem
1432160	1442800	to be one-one associated with extra-mental entities, say that a physicist could detect.
1443360	1449840	Human language has nothing like that, totally different. The structural principles, the rules
1449840	1457040	of combination, not even the remotest analog in other organisms. So what are the implications of
1457040	1464720	that for human uniqueness? You point out in the book that the primate brain in great apes or chimpanzees
1465280	1470080	looks like it has a language readiness, but obviously, as you say, there is no language there.
1470080	1475840	So what are the implications for human uniqueness? It means it's just like every other system.
1476560	1484960	Visions say there's visual readiness, which is built into mammalian visual systems.
1485680	1491840	It's readiness. It doesn't show up unless it's stimulated. You don't trigger it,
1492640	1501600	it degenerates. The way you stimulate it depends on how it develops. These are classic results in
1502560	1510080	study of vision. Language is the same. How did it develop? Well, we talk about this in the book
1510080	1518080	you mentioned. Not too much is known, but there are some suggestions about, mainly based on work of
1518240	1530400	German Neuroscientist Dr. Friedrichi has had some good ideas about how the brain,
1530400	1539040	small changes in the brain, might have provided the principle of what's called recursive generation,
1539600	1546560	the principle that allows us to create an infinite number of structures,
1546560	1552320	basically thoughts from a finite number of symbols. It's called recursive generation.
1553040	1558720	Sure, work shows how certain small changes in the brain might have led to that.
1559440	1566880	Well, that would give us recursive generation. Nature takes over, does it in the simplest possible
1566880	1576240	way, connects it somehow to our conceptual systems. You have language. In fact, many different languages
1576320	1586320	depending on how it's externalized in sound, or mostly in sound sign, looks pretty much like
1586320	1593040	that's what pretty much happened. Now, this is almost nobody in the field of evolution of language
1593040	1602560	believes this. Everybody believes it must have been by a slow, small process of natural selection.
1603520	1610320	But in my view, as I've said, I think that's simply based on a misunderstanding
1610960	1619200	of the theory of evolution, one concepts that were held 40 or 50 years ago, but have long been
1619200	1627680	abandoned, and a failure to bother to look at the nature of language. If you want to study the
1628320	1636720	evolution of any system, whatever it is, E. coli, anything, you first have to identify
1636720	1642320	the phenotype. You have to say, what's the nature of the system that I'm interested in?
1643120	1648640	You don't do that. You can't look at its evolution by definition. Well,
1649920	1657200	much of the field doesn't look at the phenotype and is distorted by a misunderstanding of the
1657200	1667760	theory of evolution. But if we extricate ourselves from these flaws, I think a relatively clear
1667760	1674080	picture emerges of what might have happened with plenty of gaps to fill.
1674080	1679040	Norm, I want to ask you about consciousness. Consciousness is a core part of closer to truth,
1679040	1685200	and we examine it from all aspects, the neuroscience sure, but a limited materialism,
1685200	1691360	but consciousness doesn't even exist. Neuroscience mechanisms, we deal with panpsychism, even to
1691360	1698320	idealism. What could the language and particularly your understanding of language and human uniqueness
1698320	1704640	contribute to the fierce debate in philosophy of mind about the deep nature of consciousness,
1704640	1712960	if anything? I should say, first of all, that I'm not overly impressed by this ferocious debate,
1712960	1719680	but we could talk about that. Actually, I think the basic answer to the debate was given
1720480	1727520	by Bertrand Russell about a century ago. I've talked about it. Within philosophy,
1727520	1732960	it's been developed particularly by Galen Strawson, a very good young philosopher.
1733840	1739440	I think he's put it very clearly, basically Russell's point. He said,
1739520	1745760	there's essentially no problem of consciousness. We know what consciousness is. That's the thing
1745760	1752640	we know most about. That's all of our lives. It's consciousness. We know more about that than
1752640	1761520	anything. I can tell you exactly what I'm conscious of right now in great detail, Russell's point.
1762080	1771440	What we don't know is what matter is. That's what's obscure. In fact, I've written extensively
1771440	1777360	about this, but it's a long story, but there has been no concept of matter since Newton.
1778560	1786240	Newton demolished the concept of matter that was the basis of modern science. It was called
1786240	1791360	the mechanical philosophy. The idea that the world is a very elaborate machine,
1792400	1804320	Galileo, Leibniz, Huygens, Newton, all, Descartes, all adopted this. Newton demonstrated that it's
1804320	1811840	not true. John Locke immediately, within a couple of years, understood the consequences
1812480	1822160	and concluded that it follows that thinking must be a property of organized matter, whatever
1822160	1829040	matter turns out to be. What matter turns out to be, we don't know. Science keeps changing,
1829040	1835760	moving, trying to discover what it is. We know what consciousness is. We don't know what matter is.
1836720	1843520	It's whatever the best theory of the world tells us. Then comes the problem of how
1844160	1851680	to relate whatever the best theory of matter is with what consciousness is. Basically Locke's
1851680	1859680	problem. How to think is a property of organized matter. Let's figure out how it works. That's
1859760	1866320	what we've been discussing. What does language tell us about consciousness? I think it tells
1866320	1874640	us something quite interesting. It tells us that almost all of the mental activity involved in
1874640	1882880	language is inaccessible to consciousness. Everything I've discussed so far is inaccessible
1882880	1890960	to consciousness. You can't introspect and discover that rules follow the principle of
1890960	1900000	structured dependence. You can't introspect and find out why he stole many books. He reads many
1900000	1906720	books, means of a racist reader, but many books are read by him. It doesn't mean that. You can't
1907680	1915120	introspect and figure out how your mind is creating those two thoughts. That's virtually
1915120	1921280	every all the use of language. Almost all of our use of language is just internal.
1922560	1928480	What you and I are now doing, externalization, is a very small part of the use of language.
1929360	1935040	Mostly we're thinking, we're reflecting. We have the slightest idea what's going on in there. We get
1935040	1941600	little bits of fragments of it now and then reach consciousness. Well, all of that is unconscious.
1941600	1949760	You have to study it pretty much the same way. You study our second nervous system. Humans have
1949760	1957600	two nervous systems. One of them is this one. The other one is this one. It's called the enteric
1957600	1966160	nervous system. Huge, complex nervous system. Huge number of neurons. Almost all the properties
1966160	1972080	of this one, it's what regulates our whole body. We're totally unconscious of it except when we
1972080	1980400	have a stomach ache and it says something's wrong. It has Alzheimer's. It has Parkinson's.
1980720	1987840	It's a huge nervous system, but we haven't the slightest awareness of it except occasionally,
1987840	1994640	stomach ache. It's pretty much the same as true of our main nervous system that's up here.
1995840	2001440	We don't know what's going on inside it. We can't introspect. We have to study it
2001440	2009520	from the outside, basically. When we can learn about it, we've been talking about some of the
2009520	2015200	ways you can learn about it, but it leaves plenty of mysteries. I think what it tells us about
2015200	2023040	consciousness is that consciousness is a pretty superficial part of human thought and cognition.
2023840	2030880	Dits and pieces come out from what's going on in there and there's not much more. I should
2030880	2037760	mention that the history of the study of consciousness is interesting. It's good scholarly work on it.
2037760	2046480	Best work is by Udo Thiel, a good historian and a philosopher. He's pointed out that the study of
2046480	2053680	consciousness in the modern sense is a very modern obsession. There wasn't much talk of
2053680	2061360	consciousness in the history of philosophy until pretty much the 17th century. Then the parts of
2061360	2070800	consciousness that were discussed were consciousness of the inner workings of our mind, not qualia,
2070800	2078960	what it feels like to see the color red. That's a modern thing, pretty much 20th century.
2078960	2086720	It's become a lead topic of philosophy, I think, in mistaken ways. The right way to look at it,
2086720	2096000	I think, is Russell Strossen, the way I've just been talking about. But what language tells us,
2096000	2103920	I think, is most of what's going on in our mental lives is inaccessible to consciousness.
2103920	2108320	So there are really two questions here. One is the relationship between what we are conscious of,
2108320	2113600	versus all the other things going on in our mind that are subconscious. Language is a spectacular
2113600	2119440	example. And of course, the autonomic system we have really no access to, and happily so.
2120240	2128080	The other question, though, is on qualia about why can we, as embodied creatures, have this
2128800	2135120	scent of inner experience, felt experience? The two questions are separate. Maybe they're related.
2136160	2140640	I appreciate your response to the first question in terms of relationship between
2141280	2145840	in language that most things are subconscious, that we have no access to whatsoever.
2146800	2154320	But what are your feelings about qualia? Gail Strossen, who was on Close to the Truth,
2154320	2162320	good friend. We communicate. He has a kind of a panpsychic view of the world, that consciousness
2162320	2167600	is everywhere. Russell had kind of a monism that I'm not sure I completely understand.
2168560	2177360	What is your deep sense? Why not ask a deeper question about Locke's suggestion? What's the
2177360	2187440	relation between whatever the brain is constituted of and thinking? That's a much more profound
2187440	2194000	question. Well, it's a hard question. Most questions are hard. One question, which is,
2194000	2199440	in my view, much less profound, is the one that philosophers are obsessed with. What's the
2200720	2209120	basis in organized matter for perceiving the color red? Not for perceiving it. That we understand
2209120	2217680	very well. The theory of how red is perceived is pretty well understood. But what it feels like
2217680	2223840	to see red? We're probably never going to get an answer to that. I expect to get an answer.
2225280	2231920	So, we know what we feel like. We can't describe it. Can you describe what you feel like when you
2231920	2239840	see red? I can't. I mean, there's a lot of talk about, a lot of work was stimulated by Thomas
2239840	2247120	Nagel's book on what it's like to be a bat. He argued persuasively that we can't really
2247680	2252160	know what it's like to be a bat. Can we know what it's like to be a human being?
2253600	2261520	Can you say what it's like to be you? I can't say what it's like to be me. I mean, I somehow
2262720	2268080	experience what it's like to be me, but I can't convey it to you. Maybe somebody can write a poem
2268080	2274240	about it. Or write a novel. You read novels, it's sort of good literature, sort of gives you some
2274240	2281280	insight into it. But do we expect to get a scientific answer to what it's like to see?
2281280	2288000	What it feels like to see the color red? I don't see any reason to believe it.
2288000	2293920	What I can say, Noam, is what it feels like to have this conversation with you is just wonderful.
2293920	2300480	I'm sorry, we're probably out of time. But that inner feeling that in my consciousness,
2300480	2304480	this has been a great experience for me. So thank you very much.
2305600	2310560	Next, in part four of Closer to Truth's four-part interview of Professor Noam Chomsky,
2310560	2316400	we discuss his thoughts, opinions, and reflections on Closer to Truth's themes and big questions.
