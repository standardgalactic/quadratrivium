0	6160	I would like to be able to understand why the laws of physics look the way they do,
6160	12240	but as in terms of why the universe exists, I think that will probably just turn out to be
12240	17920	an ill-formed question. I think that there's no such thing as the reason why the universe exists.
18160	32160	Welcome to Closer to Truth. I'm speaking with physicist and philosopher of physics,
32160	39360	Sean Carroll, about his superb, valuable new book, Quanta and Fields, the second in Sean's
39360	44400	acclaimed series, The Biggest Ideas in the Universe. It is the clearest introduction to
44480	51040	quantum mechanics and related topics with the real math that is both comprehensive and accessible,
51040	56800	which sounds like an oxymoron, but for Sean it is not. Sean, good to see you again.
57440	60000	Robert, thanks very much for having me on. Always good to be here.
60000	65040	I love the book. It's what I've been looking for. I learned a lot. I need to learn more,
65040	71760	but before we dive in, let's start with one of the possible implications of quantum theories,
71760	76720	the many-worlds interpretation, which we'll talk about later in depth, but just briefly,
76720	83040	because I read in the April 9th issue of New Scientist Magazine an article that headlines
83040	90160	the multiverse could be much, much bigger than we ever imagined, and it considers innumerable
90160	96720	subsystems of the world. You're quoted quite extensively, quite well, as taking this seriously.
96720	101200	Why do you take that seriously? Well, many worlds in general is a wonderful
101200	106720	and compelling idea. I take it seriously because it's the most straightforward implication of
106720	112480	the equations of quantum mechanics, in particular the Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics.
112480	117680	Every other version of the foundations of quantum mechanics either changes the Schrodinger equation
117680	122800	sometimes or adds new elements to it or something like that. Let me just be super duper clear for
122800	127120	the listeners. I wrote a whole book about the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics
127120	132560	and why it's good. In these books and the biggest ideas, I don't talk about it that much. I'm much
132560	138080	more focused on what we truly believe that we understand, not speculations that go beyond
138080	143440	our current knowledge. Right. No, that's clear from the book. But in the article, it talks about
143440	149680	the idea of subsystems where any two aspects of the world, what I'm doing here on Earth and
149680	155760	something that just happened in an Alpha Centauri, could be looked upon as a subsystem. Does that in
155760	162160	any way expand the traditional Hugh Everett, traditional interpretation of many worlds?
162160	166160	Because that was the implication of the article. Well, I think that it depends on what you mean
166160	171760	by the interpretation. At its very most basic level, Everett is just saying there is something
171760	177760	called the quantum state, which everyone agrees there is, the vector in Hilbert space, if you
177760	182240	want to be technical about it, but the wave function of the universe, if you want to be poetic.
182800	187200	And it always obeys the Schrodinger equation. That's it. That's the entirety of the
187200	193840	interpretation. Everything else is commentary, including the fact that there are many worlds.
193840	199760	And so there is a long running debate among people who care about the Everett interpretation
199760	205280	about what counts as a world. Where do we draw the dividing line between the different worlds?
205360	211600	And so we're thinking about the possibility that you can be pretty comprehensive in dividing it up
211600	217040	into a very large number of worlds. But the important thing is this doesn't change the
217040	222720	Everett interpretation at all. It's only a question of, is this more a more convenient
222720	227840	way of thinking about it for we limited human beings? Okay, well, there'll be more to come
227840	232720	of many worlds. We'll get into it later in more depth, but it is certainly fascinating.
232720	236960	We'll conduct our discussion in three parts. First, I want to go through each chapter of the
236960	242400	book just to get an overall high level sense of quantum fields. Then I'm going to pick out
242400	248720	several of what I think are interesting issues from the book that we can discuss in some depth.
248720	253120	And then finally, we'll have sort of some speculations about the implications of
253120	257680	quantum mechanics and the nature of reality, all good, close to the true subject. But first,
257680	266240	let me give a serious quick bio. Sean Carroll is the Homewood Professor of Natural Philosophy at
266240	271680	Johns Hopkins University, a joint appointment between physics and philosophy. Sean's research
271680	277920	has focused on cosmology, field theory, and gravitation, shifting to more foundational
277920	282960	questions in quantum mechanics. In addition to the biggest ideas in the universe series,
282960	288720	he is the author of many bestselling books, including Something Deeply Hidden, The Big Picture,
288720	295840	and From Eternity to Now. He is the host of the popular Mindscape podcast. Sean, lots to cover.
296480	302880	Again, we're going to use the chapters of your book as a framework. So let's look for a high-level
302880	310480	discussion in the overview, which is just to give some fundamentals. Just define a quanta and fields
310480	320480	by contrasting it with what we know from classical physics. Yeah, you know, it's a three-volume series
320480	325280	that we're in the middle of here. Volume one was space, time, and motion, classical physics.
325280	330560	Volume two is quantum physics, but that has to include modern ways of thinking about quantum
330560	334880	physics, which are based on quantum field theory. So a lot of the book is about quantum field theory.
335840	344880	Okay, and what is the major contrast between quanta and field? So define each of those terms
344880	352640	briefly. The idea of quanta comes from the fact that we actually, in the formulation of the theory,
352640	358800	quantum mechanics, we don't think about a lattice or discreteness or pixels or anything like that.
358800	363760	Everything is smooth and continuous, but when we observe it, the world appears to us in lumps,
363760	370400	in particles, which we call quanta, and fields are the fact that the thing that we quantize
370400	375200	to get our best picture of nature are fields that fill all of space rather than particles
375200	379440	that have a definite location. Okay, and that's a very significant point. A major part of the book
379440	385840	and we'll get into that. Okay, chapter one is on the wave function, giving the position and
385840	391920	momentum of every constituent, specifies a classical system, and giving the wave function
391920	398320	specifies the quantum state of a system. Yeah, this was a dramatic change because Isaac Newton,
398320	404000	we thought, had laid down the law for classical mechanics. What the world is, is some things
404000	409680	with positions and momenta. Quantum mechanics comes along and says, no, there's something called the
409680	415840	wave function, and we can figure out how to predict things as best we can from it, but it's an utterly
415840	424000	different thing than Newton would have thought. And for the wave function, that is not designed
424000	432320	as a representation of reality. It means it is reality. It's a big difference in science.
432320	438640	We don't agree. No one knows. I think that reality is completely represented by the wave function.
438640	444320	In other words, reality is reality, but the wave function is in a mathematical one-to-one
444320	449760	correspondence with reality. Others think that it's only part of reality or it has nothing to do
449760	455600	with reality. So that's where opinions differ. Okay, sounds like a big difference. So you bring
455600	461760	up the Schrodinger equation very briefly. Describe it. The Schrodinger equation is what replaces
461760	467840	in quantum mechanics f equals ma from classical mechanics, the equation of motion Newton's second
467840	472560	law. It's the thing that says, okay, I've told you what the world is. Newton would have said
472560	478320	positions in momentum. Quantum mechanics says it's a wave function. Now tell me how it evolves,
478320	481840	how it changes over time. That's what the Schrodinger equation does.
481840	486720	Great. And one other point from this chapter, which comes out as important, is when you use the
486720	492560	Hamiltonian, which you discussed in your first book, in quantum mechanics, that becomes an operator.
492560	499280	And so give us just some sense of what an operator is in terms of a mathematical function
499280	504720	that characterizes quantum mechanics versus classical mechanics.
505280	509680	Yeah. So I was happy enough in book one to talk about something called the Hamiltonian,
509680	514960	which is a fancy way of saying the energy of a system as a function of the positions and
514960	520560	momenta of everything. So you have some complicated arrangement of stuff. And the Hamiltonian is
520560	526000	one number. It's the energy of that particular arrangement of stuff. In quantum mechanics,
526080	531760	the Hamiltonian, like many other things, is not a number. It's an operator, which means I start
531760	538320	with a wave function with some quantum mechanical state. And the Hamiltonian operates on that to
538320	542720	give me a different wave function. And then I can do things with it like plug it into the Schrodinger
542720	548160	equation. Good. So that's a very significant difference. Okay. Chapter two is on measurement.
548160	551520	Let's start very quickly is what is the measurement problem?
552480	556560	Well, this is the big thing for the foundations of quantum mechanics, right? Because
557360	563120	if all that had happened when we invented quantum mechanics was to replace positions and momenta
563120	567120	with wave functions, that would be slightly annoying, but we would deal with it waves are
567120	573200	things that physicists know how to deal with very, very well. The problem is that when you look at
573200	577360	a quantum system, it doesn't look like a wave function. It looks like particles or something
577360	583200	like that. So the measurement problem is, what do you mean when you say look at a system? What
583200	589840	exactly happens? What counts as a measurement? What can make it happen? What kind of agents can
589840	596240	make it happen? Why are measurements important at all? Yeah, and many people extrapolate that
596240	602320	significantly to say there has to be a conscious observer. And this has great philosophical
602320	609520	implications about the nature of reality or the nature of consciousness, which I don't think we
609520	614640	agree with. Well, I don't agree with it. I'm not going to put words in anyone else's. Well, I think
614640	621200	we mean you and I. Yeah, right. So, you know, we don't know what the answer to this measurement
621200	626720	problem is, but it's not that we have no good ideas. We have lots of good ideas. And what we
626800	633440	teach our students is not very good, is not very sensible, is not very coherent. It's just that
633440	638480	when you measure something, the wave function suddenly changes, it collapses. But you're not
638480	643360	allowed to ask what it means to do a measurement, to what counts as a measurement. So it's good
643360	648320	enough. That sort of half baked version of quantum mechanics is good enough to win many,
648320	653360	many Nobel Prizes. But it's not quite precise and clear enough to be a well formulated theory of
653360	658240	reality. In this chapter, just give some sense of what Hilbert space is and how that compares
658240	662720	with regular space and why that's important in quantum mechanics. Yeah, it's too bad that the
662720	669040	word space is used here. And I blame the mathematicians for this. They consider any set
669040	674800	with interesting structures on it to be called a space, right? So the space of all possible,
674800	681280	blah, blah, blah, very different than the three dimensional space that you and I live in. So Hilbert
681280	686880	space is the mathematical space where all of the wave functions live. Every possible quantum state
686880	693280	of the universe is an element of Hilbert space. And John von Neumann, the famous physicist and
693280	699280	mathematician, showed that mathematically, Hilbert space is a vector space. That means that
699280	703760	quantum states are vectors. You can add them together. You can, they have a direction, they
703760	708720	have a magnitude. They don't have a direction in physical space in the three dimensional world.
708800	713520	They have a direction in this gigantically dimensioned thing called Hilbert space.
714320	720800	Chapter three entanglement. A very interesting point you make is that when we think classically,
720800	727200	we think particles. And when we think in quantum, we first think of the quantum state, then particles.
728320	732560	Yeah. And importantly, when you have more than one particle in classical mechanics,
732560	738400	it's not a big deal. You just add more particles. You describe each particle individually. The
738480	744720	classical world is separable. You can treat each part of it all by itself and then add in what
744720	750800	its interactions are with the rest of the world. Entanglement in quantum mechanics says the quantum
750800	755840	world is not like that. There are not separate quantum states for different parts of the universe.
755840	762240	There is only one wave function for the whole universe all at once. And that has important
762240	768320	experimental implications. You can measure one part of the universe and that tells you something
768320	770480	about the possible measurement outcomes somewhere else.
771840	777600	Chapter four is on fields, a very important part of the book because quantum field theory,
778320	784160	as you state, is the single best way to describe the universe at its deepest known level. So
784160	789760	quantum field theory really becomes the foundation out of which quantum mechanics and
790640	796320	particles emerge. Yeah. And I want to emphasize there's 12 chapters in the book and only three
796320	802000	of them are about quantum mechanics by itself. We move very quickly onto fields because it's such
802000	808160	a rich, amazingly deep subject. And so in this chapter, chapter four, we just make our lives
808160	813040	very, very simple. We say, what if there was just one field in the universe and it didn't interact
813040	818240	with anything else? It's all by itself. And what we show is that when you apply the rules of
818240	825360	quantum mechanics to that situation, that field acts like a collection of particles or
825360	830720	more specifically, because quantum mechanics lets us consider super positions of different
830720	836880	things like Schrodinger's cat being partly awake and partly asleep. You can have a quantum field
836880	843520	representing zero particles and also one particle and also two particles, etc. all the way up all at
843520	852480	once. And significantly, then particles are really the quantized excitation of fields as opposed to
853440	858160	entities in themselves. This is, I think, one of the most fundamental points.
858800	864400	Absolutely. It surely is. As I say in the book, if you were a physicist working at the end of
864400	870000	the 1800s, you would have been forgiven for thinking we were almost done with physics.
870000	875520	Classical mechanics seemed pretty good. And you could divide the world into particles and fields,
875520	881120	particles like electrons or atoms, fields like the electromagnetic field, the gravitational field,
881120	889680	and so on. And quantum field theory unifies all of that. It's all fields. But when you look at
889680	894960	fields, when you measure them in precisely the right way, they appear to us as particles. So
894960	901120	it's really only one thing going on deep down. So the implication that particles are quantized
901120	909600	excitation of fields answers a fundamental question with all the number of electrons in the
909600	916240	universe or protons 10 to the 80 or whatever the number is. How could they all be exactly the same?
917600	923840	Because it just seems impossible. But when you think of them as not as entities that we have to
923840	930160	explain why they're all the same, but they're all the product of a field, the answer becomes obvious.
931200	935920	You know, you're right. There are about 10 to the 80th electrons in the observable universe. You
935920	940160	got the right number there. I'm very impressed. That was very nice. And you're also right that
940160	945680	the reason why every electron is identical to every other electron is because fundamentally,
945680	950560	the world is not made of electrons or other particles. It's made of fields. And there's
950560	956400	something called the electron field. And when you poke at it and make a little vibration,
956400	961680	that shows up to us as an electron particle. But the underlying field has the same physical
961760	966720	properties no matter when or where you are in the universe. So every electron looks identical
966720	972880	to us. And not only look, but they actually are. They actually are. And quantum mechanics has
972880	980080	a lot to say about that. Yes. Chapter five interactions. Well, of course, this is where
980080	985440	things truly become exciting and mind bending. Because in the previous chapter, we show that
985440	990560	if you had just one field all by itself, not interacting with anything, it would look like
990560	994800	particles. But there's nothing to look at it, right? In order to look at it, you need other
994800	1000320	fields interacting with it. And that's where we get to talk about Feynman diagrams. Feynman was
1000320	1006640	the one who really showed us how to think about interacting quantum fields. Two electrons come
1006640	1012160	close together. They interact by tossing back and forth some photons or some other particles.
1012160	1017760	They scatter off to go elsewhere. Sometimes the answer is infinity, which worries you. That'll
1017760	1023600	be another chapter. But the point is, there's a recipe for going from some specific kind of
1023600	1029920	interactions that you specify dynamically to all these little pictures of what happens,
1029920	1033600	which gives you a way of calculating your quantum mechanical probabilities.
1034240	1046560	On a simple look, Feynman diagrams just seem almost Lego simplistic. Why are they so powerful
1046640	1052320	when they look so simple? Well, that's a great question. One of the motivations behind writing
1052320	1058960	this book is to move beyond the idea that Feynman diagrams are just cartoons. Because in a book
1058960	1065920	like this, my grand ambition is to show people the equations, to unveil the specific quantitative
1065920	1072000	relationships beneath the metaphors and analogies that we usually get. So in a traditional popular
1072000	1077040	science treatment, including ones that I've given myself, you will draw a Feynman diagram and you'll
1077040	1082000	say, this represents this interaction, blah, blah, blah. But you're left a little unsatisfied,
1082000	1087440	because why do I have to draw that diagram? So here in this book, we explain that every diagram
1087440	1094560	is a number. Diagrams can be used to calculate quantum mechanical amplitudes, basically to
1094560	1100560	calculate the wave function for this particular process. And from that, we can get the probability
1100560	1106720	of observing that process. So they're not just cute little pictures of what happens.
1106720	1112320	They're fiercely quantitative ways of measuring and characterizing the probability that something
1112320	1118400	happens. Chapter six, effective field theory. This is my favorite chapter. I don't know if it's
1118400	1122720	going to be anybody else's favorite chapter, but you know, we alluded to the fact that these
1122720	1127920	Feynman diagrams, which are supposed to help us calculate things, can easily lead to trouble
1127920	1133680	because you calculate a number and the number is infinity. And this seems bad. And so Feynman
1133680	1138000	and Schwinger and Tom and Aga won the Nobel Prize for wrestling with this, showing us that we could
1138000	1144000	get away with it. But it always seemed a little unsatisfying, the process called renormalization.
1144880	1148560	Feynman himself was not happy with renormalization throughout his life.
1148560	1150960	It just sounds like a fudge factor.
1151680	1158560	It does sound like that. But basically, it was all figured out by Ken Wilson in the 60s and 70s.
1158560	1164720	And somehow the world doesn't know about this and the world should know about this. What Wilson said
1164720	1170320	is that the reason why Feynman diagrams give you infinity is because you're including particles
1170320	1174960	with infinitely big energies. And you don't know what's going on when particles have infinitely
1175040	1181760	big energies. Maybe space time doesn't exist or something like that. So he showed us how to just
1181760	1188320	remove those unwanted, ill understood parts from our Feynman diagrams. And we are left with what
1188320	1193840	is called an effective field theory, because they are very, very effective. Chapter seven,
1193840	1200640	which is one of my favorite chapters, which you call scale. And you introduce the idea of scale
1200640	1207120	by saying the number of nucleons of basic Newtonian protons in various orders of magnitude.
1207840	1212960	Human DNA or bacterium would have 10 to the 12th. A human being would have 10 to the 28th.
1212960	1220160	The Earth would have 10 to the 51. The Sun would have 10 to the 57. So that's a million times
1220160	1227040	more. Exponent of 6 is a million. And so the Earth is roughly a millionth the size of the Sun,
1227040	1233200	which is right. Milky Way Galaxy, 10 to the 70th. I think that looks like 10 trillion suns,
1233200	1238400	which is more than the number of stars in the galaxy. But there's a lot of gas and other stuff.
1238400	1243440	So that's order of magnitude, right? And then the whole observable universe, 10 to the 80th,
1244480	1253280	which is 10 billion galaxies, seems actually low. Because I think that now 10 trillion,
1253600	1260240	maybe it should be 10 to the 82nd. But you see this beautiful hierarchy. And to me, that's the
1260240	1266720	best, simplest way to get a sense of the structure of reality. I mean, it's literally breathtaking.
1267600	1272960	Yeah, you know, this chapter is kind of a reward. It's a little respite. You know,
1272960	1275840	you've just done the last couple of chapters, you're pretty heavy going.
1276560	1283920	Yeah, it's a lot. And so we want to like put it together. And as you see, as you say,
1284800	1290240	reflect on the beautiful structure that comes out of this, because this talk about quantum
1290240	1295520	mechanics and field theory, sometimes it said, this describes the world of the very small,
1295520	1300240	but actually describes the whole world, including the very big, he says, you don't need it to describe
1300240	1304960	most features of galaxies or stars. You need it when you get down to subatomic particles,
1304960	1307840	but they all fit in to the quantum field theory framework.
1308400	1316320	An interesting point in this chapter, which is a great way to understand how the world works,
1316320	1322800	is the fact that we know that that protons and neutrons are made up of quarks, three quarks,
1322800	1330320	different colors or characteristic strangeness. And they come together in different ways. And
1330400	1337840	we think that's what composes it. And they're held together with the boson, the force of gluons.
1337840	1344640	But the point that you make, which is the critical point, is that if you took out all the quarks,
1345280	1351680	and only had the equivalent masses of the of the of the force, which is the gluons,
1351680	1357440	the total mass wouldn't get that much less. I mean, that's a that's an astounding idea.
1357520	1364800	Yeah, you know, this is why it's necessary and useful to think about quantum field theory, because
1365600	1370320	sometimes when you have an electron going through your bubble chamber or whatever,
1370320	1373920	you don't need to think about the details of quantum field theory. You can just think of
1373920	1380320	it as a particle moving in a certain trajectory. But inside a proton or a neutron, the world is
1380320	1386800	very different from the world of our intuition of particles and so forth. So we're told once again,
1386800	1393680	in the pop science level, that a proton has three quarks inside. But the mass of the proton is much
1393680	1399760	bigger than the sum of the masses of those quarks. And also another thing that I go through in the
1399760	1405680	book is there's something called the Compton wavelength of a particle, which is roughly, you
1405680	1411760	know, the size you can squeeze its wave function down to. And the Compton wavelength of a quark
1411760	1417520	is much bigger than the size of the proton that it squeezed into. So what is going on here?
1417520	1421280	And the answer is that you should read the book because it's all about quantum field theory and
1421280	1425440	all does make sense. Okay, so now I'm going to go quickly through some of the later chapters.
1425440	1430720	Eight is symmetry. Symmetry is very important, you know, whenever you hear things like the
1430720	1437280	standard model is an SU three cross SU two cross you one gauge theory. What do all of those symbols
1437280	1441600	mean? What do all those words mean? It's all about symmetry and group theory. And that's
1441600	1447120	why I explained this in the book. Chapter nine is gauge theory, which is a particular kind of field
1447120	1453680	theory. That's right. So the previous chapter was about the mathematics of symmetry. Gauge theories
1453680	1460000	are putting that mathematics to work in quantum field theory. It is the existence of certain
1460000	1466160	kinds of symmetries gauge symmetries that give rise to the forces of nature. The reason why there
1466160	1472000	are forces is because of a symmetry in the underlying quantum field theory. And this transformation
1472000	1479520	can be done at every at any point in space time. That's what the word gauge means in gauge symmetry.
1479520	1485280	It means that I have red, green and blue quarks, for example, that's a three dimensional space,
1485280	1491040	and I can rotate it. That's a symmetry in SU three symmetry, but I can rotate it separately at every
1491040	1497440	point in space time. And that means I need a new field to be able to connect them. That field
1497440	1502160	turns out to be the glue on which holds particles together. One of the points you made out a little
1502160	1512160	difficulty with is from gauge theory, you can derive the idea that the force carrying particles
1512160	1521040	are naturally massless like the like the photon, etc. I didn't quite get that. How you how you so
1521040	1527360	quickly get to that conclusion, which is obviously important. Yeah, it is. So we talk about in earlier
1527360	1533600	chapters, what it looks like when a field has a mass, it all comes down to the dynamics of the field,
1533600	1539440	it's a way for the field to interact with itself, so that its particles move slower than the speed
1539440	1544480	of light and have what we would call a mass, the more force you put on them, the more they accelerate
1544480	1550480	like F equals MA in Newton's laws. Now gauge symmetries come along, and there's a symmetry there
1550480	1556800	which very, very tightly restricts the possible terms you can write down in the equations of
1556800	1563040	motion for these particles. And it turns out that the particular kind of interaction you need
1563040	1569440	to give those particles a mass is forbidden by the symmetry. It would break the symmetry if you
1569440	1573520	just naively wrote it down. Well, you can write it down, people did, and they're like, ah, now it's
1573520	1580000	not gauge invariant anymore. So that symmetry not only gives rise to a new force, but it implies
1580000	1585200	that the particles carrying that force should be massless, whether they're photons or gravitons
1585200	1592400	or gluons. Chapter 10 phases. This is a big one because I just told you that gauge symmetries
1592480	1598640	imply that force carrying particles are massless. But in nature, we have things called the WNZ
1598640	1604400	bosons, which are force carrying particles which are not massless. What's going on with that?
1604400	1609120	And the answer is that gauge theories can appear in different phases, very analogous to like the
1609120	1615360	phases of water being ice or liquid or vapor. There's different ways to apparently break the
1615440	1622800	symmetry, not really break it, but hide it. And that gives masses to the WNZ bosons, not to mention
1622800	1629360	particles like the electron and the quarks. I'm very familiar, most people are with the standard
1629360	1638080	model of particle physics. Stephen Weinberg, particularly, is personifies that you introduced
1638080	1645760	the idea or explained the idea of core theory as well. So how does the standard model articulate
1645760	1651680	with core theory? I borrowed that term from Frank Wilczek, who introduced it. And it's basically
1651680	1658960	a way of reminding you that gravity is less of a bad fit than you might think. We have this thing,
1658960	1664640	we say, we don't understand quantum gravity, etc., etc. What would be more accurate to say
1664640	1670240	is that we don't have a full, complete, final theory of quantum gravity. We don't have a theory
1670240	1676400	of quantum gravity that includes black holes or the big bang or things like that. But as long as
1676400	1682080	gravity is relatively weak, like all the solar system, including the sun, the earth, etc.,
1682080	1687120	we're nowhere near making a black hole. Gravity is pretty weak. Under those circumstances,
1687120	1693360	we understand quantum gravity fine. So the core theory is just the standard model of particle
1693360	1700080	physics plus gravity in that weak field regime. Okay, so the standard model is a subset of core
1700080	1707520	theory with the asterisk that this applies to low levels of gravity. Yeah, that's exactly right.
1707520	1714800	Okay, good. Okay, chapter 11 on matters, bringing things together. Well, matter could mean almost
1714800	1720160	anything. But what I took it to mean, but I wanted to explain was why when you have certain kinds of
1720160	1726720	fields, bosons, like the Higgs boson or the photon or whatever, they can pile on top of each other
1726720	1732800	and give you a classical force field. Whereas other kinds of particles, fermions, like electrons
1732800	1738720	and neutrinos and quarks, they take up space. They make up matter. The table in front of you or
1738720	1744160	whatever has a certain solidity, a certain density, because some particles take up space.
1745040	1759440	I explain why in this chapter. Okay. And that's why my hand don't pass. I can't
1759440	1765360	indigitate. I can't put my hand through a table. And that's because the difference between the
1765360	1771280	matter and the forces. The reason why you can punch somebody effectively is ultimately because
1771760	1774400	electrons do not want to be in the same quantum state. Yes.
1776320	1783280	Okay, chapter 12, Adams. Yeah. So for the final chapter, we put it all together and we answer
1783280	1788240	the question, if there's all these particles out there, you know, Higgs bosons and top quarks and
1788240	1795360	whatever, why are you and I made of so few particles, electrons, protons, neutrons, you know, a couple
1795360	1800320	of force carrying particles. So we talked about the dynamics of these particles and how they decay
1800400	1806720	into each other. What are the stable final particles? Why do neutrons become stable inside
1806720	1812000	a nucleus, but not outside a nucleus? How does it all fit together to make up the periodic table
1812000	1819360	of the elements? And the big question of a baryon asymmetry, where in the early universe,
1819360	1826640	I think you say there were 10 billion anti baryon particles versus 10 billion plus one
1826640	1833280	baryon and therefore all the 10 billion canceled out, but the one left over out of 10 billion
1835040	1841200	becomes the entire universe. That's exactly right. And we don't know why. And I'm going to be very
1841200	1845920	honest. I'm not going to tell you why in this book, because I'm sticking to things that we know,
1845920	1849680	that's when we don't know the answer to. Yeah. And that you said it before, but it's an important
1849680	1855440	point about the book. We have these very speculative ideas. You've dealt with it in other books. But
1855440	1861840	this book is really the depth of the understanding of what we do know and what we're sure of and
1861840	1867760	how that works. Okay, let's go into our second part, which is just taking some of the issues that
1867760	1875760	are just fascinating and dealing. And let's start with wave particle duality. And in particular,
1875760	1882000	the celebrated double slit experiment. And why is that so important? Yeah, you know, wave particle
1882000	1887760	duality is honestly overrated. I think Edward Whitten once said, the battle is over, the waves
1887760	1894560	have won. The world is clearly made of waves. But it appears like particles under certain
1894560	1900720	circumstances. That's the magic of quantum measurement. What the world is is very wave,
1900720	1905760	very field like. But under the right circumstances, when you measure something, it looks like a
1905760	1911760	particle. The double slit experiment is a famous example of that, where you say a single electron
1911760	1917360	can pass through two slits and interfere with itself. If you really just accept that electrons
1917360	1922000	are not particles, they're described by wave functions. That's the least surprising thing in
1922000	1928160	the world. Waves can interfere with each other. Right. And how deeply do we understand that?
1929840	1936320	Some would speculate that the double split experiment is evidence for the many world
1936320	1940960	interpretation. You wouldn't go that far, would you? I would not go that far. I think, again,
1940960	1947680	all you need to believe in is the reality of wave functions. Now, some people don't. Some people
1947680	1951920	think that wave functions are just ways to calculate experimental outcomes, and we should
1951920	1958400	not attribute reality to them. And I think that those people have a very difficult time in explaining
1958400	1962000	things like the double slit experiment. They can do it, but they kind of have to bend over
1962000	1968160	backwards to do it. So if you just trust the equations, if you just believe what is sitting
1968160	1972640	right in front of your face, here's a wave function, here's the equation it obeys,
1972640	1976240	everything, I think, makes perfect sense. I don't think the double slit is especially mysterious.
1977280	1982560	The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is almost a household world and is used in many,
1982560	1989520	in many forms. One of the highlights of the book to me was understanding it in its deeper meaning
1990000	1996880	and to really appreciate why it is the case. So give me a brief sense of that.
1997680	2002240	Yeah, you know, it's, again, not a postulate of quantum mechanics. It's something that pops out
2002240	2007520	of the formalism of quantum mechanics. But it's fascinating to me because Isaac Newton
2008240	2012720	in his formulation of classical mechanics says very clearly, you need to tell me
2012720	2017920	the position of something and its momentum, and then I can predict where it will go. The state
2017920	2023520	of something is its position and its momentum. Quantum mechanics comes along and says my wave
2023520	2030160	function is psi of x. That is to say, for every possible position of the particle,
2030160	2035120	I can attach a wave function number and I would square that to get the probability of observing
2035120	2041440	it. So where did P go? What happened to momentum? P is the letter that we use for momentum. How can
2041440	2048000	you possibly capture everything there is about the system in terms of just the wave function
2048000	2051920	as a function of position? So I explain the answer to that. We know what the answer is.
2052480	2058240	And the answer is, remember, quantum states are vectors in Hilbert space. And basically,
2058240	2063680	when you have a vector, if you just do have x, y, and z, then you have components of the vector.
2063680	2067920	You've chosen a basis. You're going to tell me what the vector is by giving you the components.
2068560	2074960	In quantum mechanics, the relationship between position and momentum is changing bases,
2075600	2081680	changing the fundamental axes along which you measure your vector. And then if you believe that,
2081680	2087120	if position is one kind of basis, momentum is a different kind of basis, the uncertainty
2087120	2091120	principle is automatically true. It's almost trivial. In fact, there are physicists out there
2091120	2095680	who will say, oh, it's just obvious. You shouldn't be worried about it. Because if you've rotated
2095680	2104080	your vectors, you can't be completely 100% in a direction in one basis and also complete 100%
2104080	2108320	along an axis in the different basis because they're rotated with respect to each other. So
2108320	2112880	that's an example. It's a great example where a little bit of math, I think, makes everything
2112880	2122240	much, much clearer. And it pops out, as you said. It's a forced realization as opposed to a brilliant
2122240	2127440	new idea. Yeah. I mean, it was a brilliant new idea when Heisenberg came up with it. But honestly,
2127440	2132720	we understand quantum mechanics better now than we did in those early days. So it does,
2132720	2136560	once you understand what quantum mechanics is trying to tell you, the uncertainty principle
2136560	2142720	just comes along for the ride. You make the statement that entanglement helps us understand
2142720	2149120	measurement. That was to be one of the most interesting statements in the book. These are two
2149120	2155840	of the most important aspects of quantum mechanics, obviously, and you link them together. How does
2155840	2161840	that happen? Yeah, you know, I actually struggled while writing the book with the fact that we
2161840	2166880	don't agree on the basic language with which to talk about quantum mechanics. We don't agree on
2166880	2173840	whether wave functions are real or not. And I decided that, you know, rather than on every page
2173840	2177840	saying, well, if you think this, you would say this thing. And then this, you know, that would
2177840	2183520	just drag it down. So I said, we're going to talk as if wave functions are real. I happen to think
2183520	2188320	that they are, I happen to think that is the right way to think about reality. But it certainly
2188400	2194160	provides a much easier way of talking about what happens in quantum mechanics. And if you accept
2194160	2200000	that, then we have an answer to the question, what do you mean by doing a measurement? And the
2200000	2204880	answer is a measurement happens when a quantum mechanical system that again, it can be in a
2204880	2210720	superposition like spin up and spin down at some fraction of each all by itself. That's fine.
2211280	2217680	A measurement is when that system becomes entangled with the rest of the world. And that's when
2217680	2222960	the two parts of the superposition are no longer sort of living by themselves. They're now related
2222960	2228800	to everything else in the universe. That's what we call a measurement. Okay, you also make the
2228800	2234000	point we talked about a little bit earlier of the wave function of the universe that and the basic
2234000	2239520	idea I think is that no matter how you define your system, whether it's, as you said, two particles
2239520	2246240	or the entire universe, there's still only one wave function of that system. So give me some color
2246240	2251280	around that. Yeah, you know, this is one of the things that is very, very difficult for people
2251280	2256960	to wrap their brains around. Because we look at the world around us, we see many separate objects,
2256960	2263440	that just seems to be pretty obvious. And quantum mechanics, to put it in closer to truth language,
2263440	2268400	is more of a monist theory. It says there's really only one thing the wave function of the
2268400	2273200	entire universe. And so people struggle to understand it. But what I would advocate is just
2273840	2280640	accepting that, accept that there is only one thing and ask the other way, ask, why does this
2280640	2286320	one thing, the wave function of the universe, appear to us as many things? That's the surprising
2286320	2291920	thing. Why does it look like apparently the world is made of many separate things? And there,
2291920	2298240	that's an answerable question. It comes down again to measurement, what we call decoherence,
2298320	2303200	which is when these quantum systems that are in a superposition become entangled with the rest of
2303200	2309200	the world. And it all does ultimately make sense, even if it doesn't come close to our everyday
2309200	2315840	intuitions. What is the hierarchy problem? Well, we mentioned before the core theory, right,
2315840	2321200	the standard model of particle physics plus gravity. It's a theory that fits essentially
2321200	2325440	all of the data that we have from laboratory experiments here on earth. It doesn't fit
2326000	2330240	some things in outer space, which is why we need dark matter and dark energy, etc. But here on
2330240	2336720	earth, it does a very good job. The problem is, even though it fits the data, there are parameters,
2336720	2343360	coupling constants, numbers inside the core theory that are very, very surprising, that are not at
2343360	2348800	all what we would expect if those numbers were just chosen randomly. The hierarchy problem refers
2348800	2354240	to the fact that there are two parameters. One is the Planck scale, the scale at which gravity
2354240	2360160	becomes important, okay, 10 to the 18 billion electron volts. And then there is the mass of
2360160	2366400	the Higgs boson, which tells us the electroweak scale, the scale for particle physics, if you like.
2366400	2373440	And that's at about 100 billion electron volts. But if you read chapter six on effective field
2373440	2378880	theory, you will learn that particle physicists see no reason why these two scales should be so
2378880	2384240	different from each other. You would naturally expect them to be very similar to each other,
2384240	2390720	and they're different by a factor of 10 to the 16, which is just a little crazy. That's the hierarchy
2390720	2395600	problem. We still don't know the answer to it. And also, how about the relationship between the
2395600	2404160	powers of the forces between the electromagnetic and the gravitational power of forces? There's a
2404160	2411280	huge difference. Once again, if you're just imagining a universe or a world, you wouldn't
2411280	2417520	think there'd be such a vast difference in scale. Yeah, this is where it becomes very,
2417520	2422800	very tricky because you have to ask, you know, how do you measure these things? Like, after all,
2422800	2429600	the electromagnetic force between two neutrons is zero. But the electromagnetic force between
2429600	2436160	two protons is considerable. Gravity is different because everything is affected by gravity. So
2436160	2441040	the difference in the strength of the forces is actually not something that physicists spend a lot
2441040	2446720	of time dwelling on. That's harder to sort of know what your expectations should have been.
2447760	2452720	There's something called the weak gravity conjecture that conjectures that there are good
2452720	2459120	reasons why gravity has to be the weakest force. But honestly, that's beyond the scope of the book
2459120	2464160	here. So we're trying to stick to things in this book that everyone will still agree on 500 years
2464160	2470560	from now. Good. Well, that's a challenge. But I think that's a very admirable one and that and
2470560	2480000	very clear in terms of the purpose of the book. In that area of hierarchy, and we have the cosmological
2480000	2487680	constant, which, as you point out, very strongly is the vacuum energy of empty space, quote, unquote.
2488560	2494720	But the difference between the calculated theoretical value and the observational value
2495600	2503600	is, as you say, 10 to the minus 122. So that's 10 to the minus 122 zeros, which is
2504400	2511440	the largest mismatch in all of physics and all of reality in terms of the relationship between
2511440	2521200	theory and experimental observation. What does that tell us? Well, we're not sure what it tells
2521200	2526480	us, to be perfectly honest. Again, this is an open problem. I think that the contribution of a book
2526480	2532480	like Quantum Fields is that the reader can truly understand the problem in a way that it's harder
2532480	2539200	to do otherwise. Because once you understand what quantum field theory is, and once you understand
2539200	2545520	how effective field theory works, now you can follow the argument that says something like
2545520	2552640	the vacuum energy should be a certain number. Because it's certainly not a clear crisp prediction,
2552640	2557120	right? We actually don't know what the vacuum energy should be. We have rough back of the
2557120	2563840	envelope expectations for what it should be. And if it had been off by 10 to the two or 10 to the
2563840	2567760	three, then we would have dealt with that. We would have rolled with that and said, okay, that's how
2567760	2574400	the cookie crumbles. But when it's off by 10 to the 122, then we go, you know, I bet there's a reason
2574400	2580000	why. I bet there's an explanation. I bet this is not just luck, right? And again, I'm not going to
2580000	2585040	tell you what the answer is in this book, but I'm going to help you appreciate why physicists think
2585040	2590880	it's a real problem. And the quantum field theory is the foundation of what creates the problem in
2590880	2598880	a sense. 100%. You know, quantum field theory is super, super, super successful at fitting the
2598880	2607600	data. Once you put in these incredibly finely tuned, seemingly unnatural parameters for certain
2607600	2614480	parts of the laws of physics. So it's kind of a weird problem. It's not the usual thing in science
2614480	2619680	where we have a theory, it makes a prediction, and then the experiment says, no, that's not it.
2620400	2626080	This is not a place where we have a prediction. We have a feeling, we have vibes, right? And so
2626080	2629520	the question of how seriously we should take that is a very good one.
2630160	2635680	Okay, now we go on to part three, which is pure speculation. And so we want to emphasize that
2635680	2643120	the book gives everyone the the capacity to understand the what is real and what is known
2643200	2652320	today, and can therefore look at speculative ideas from the found from the unified foundation that
2652320	2658960	we have of particularly quantum field theory. So what comes now is pure speculation, Sean.
2660160	2666880	You know, we're just going to just ask your feelings and we'll hold you to them if you want
2666880	2671520	to change it the next time we talk. So the first one, I've got to go back to the many worlds
2671520	2679440	interpretation, which you have forcefully and very strongly articulated and advocate.
2680160	2684960	And I don't want to, obviously, there are differences. There's, you know, pilot wave,
2684960	2689280	Bohmian mechanical, all sorts of different explanations. But I don't want to put that
2689280	2695520	aside. I want to say, okay, if the many worlds interpretation is real, if that is the way
2695520	2703440	reality is, you know, how does it work? I mean, there are 10 to the 80th, the numbers of particles,
2703440	2711920	maybe 10 to the 90th photons, each one can can be analyzed in terms of the plank time of each one,
2712640	2718480	and different relationship. How do you deal with the way to even think about the number of worlds?
2718480	2724080	Is it, you know, 10 to the 80th or 90th factorial in some sense per plank time? I mean,
2724160	2728880	I just want to get a sense of the, the order of magnitude of how you think about many worlds.
2729840	2734960	Yeah, I mean, the real answer there is I don't think about all those other worlds that much.
2734960	2740800	Again, the worlds are a prediction of the theory. They're not what the theory is fundamentally about.
2740800	2747280	The theory says the world, the total world, the whole universe, what we can see and what we can't
2747280	2752880	is described by quantum mechanical wave function. And that wave function obeys the Schrodinger
2752880	2757520	equation. That's the theory. And we're trying to work out the consequences of that theory.
2758080	2763120	One of the consequences is when you do a quantum mechanical measurement, and again,
2763120	2767840	measurement can be defined independently of people or consciousness is just about becoming
2767840	2775280	entangled with the rest of the world. The world branches into multiple somewhat classical looking
2775280	2781280	parts, the different parts look individually almost classical, but they're separate from each
2781280	2786480	other because in one the spin was up and the other was the spin was down. I appreciate and
2786480	2791280	understand all of that. I'm just trying to get a sense of the order of magnitude of the numbers.
2791280	2796640	If we take, you know, a period of time, one second, could you invite into the plank time,
2796640	2802800	how many different total worlds emerge from that given the number of the particles in the
2802800	2807440	observable universe? Right. And I'm trying to convince you to not worry about that. That's the
2807520	2814880	wrong question to worry about. Let me say two things. Number one, we don't know is the answer
2814880	2821280	because in order to know that, you would have to know the dimensionality of Hilbert space of the
2821280	2826560	fundamental theory of everything. And we don't know that right now. Can you give me some boundaries?
2827440	2834160	I'm trying. I'm trying. It could be infinite, right? For many simple quantum mechanical systems,
2834160	2838400	the best description is in terms of an infinite dimensional Hilbert space.
2838400	2844080	And in that case, it would be strictly nonsensical to ask how many worlds are there. It's like
2844080	2850880	saying how many points are there between zero and one. But what you can do is compare the number of
2850880	2856560	points between zero and point one to the number of points between zero and one. You can give the
2856560	2862080	relative amount of worlds with certain qualities and that many worlds is able to do very, very well.
2862640	2868480	But it's also possible that the magnitude of the dimensionality of Hilbert space is finite.
2868480	2874640	Indeed, I think that quantum gravity suggests that it probably is finite, at least when you
2874640	2880000	only consider our observable universe. But the number is very big. The dimensionality of Hilbert
2880000	2887600	space for observable universe is something like 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 120.
2888560	2892640	So that's plenty of room for lots of worlds to happen. We're not going to run out of room
2892640	2902560	anytime soon. So that's a question of the phase space or the capacity, which is obviously 10 to
2902560	2911280	the 10 to the 120 is enormous. But it doesn't say how many of those occur every period of time.
2912240	2918640	Can you put a bound on that? If many worlds is correct, within a period of time, one second
2918640	2924480	take, what is the lower bound and what is the upper bound? Is there any way you can do that?
2924480	2931120	No, I can't because, again, the theory doesn't talk about worlds. Worlds are things that human
2931120	2938160	beings invent to talk about the wave function of the universe in a convenient way. Two people
2938160	2943200	might decide to divide up the wave function of the universe differently. As long as they agree
2943200	2948160	on what the wave function of the universe is, they're fine. So the question of what is the
2948160	2955840	number of worlds is just like, what is the number of colors? Okay, let's go on to fine tuning,
2955840	2964240	which has been extant in physics. It's been extant in science, theology, discussions.
2965200	2970080	How do you view the fine tuning of the universe, particularly in light of quantum field theory?
2970640	2974880	Well, I think that the word fine tuning gets bounced around in at least two very, very different
2974880	2981040	senses. Very often in the popular discourse, it has something to do with life, that the universe
2981040	2988960	is finely tuned to allow for the existence of life. But physicists will often use the word
2988960	2995760	fine tuning in a way that has nothing to do with life, just to say that certain parameters,
2995760	3002720	like the mass of the Higgs boson, for example, in our equations seem to be represented by adding
3002720	3008640	up many different numbers. And the many different numbers are individually much bigger than the
3008640	3013520	sum of them that you get for the Higgs boson. And that's not impossible because some of the
3013520	3018880	numbers are positive and some of the numbers are negative, but somehow they cancel out to give you
3018880	3023360	a much smaller number than you would expect. And that's fine tuning to a physicist. So I think
3023360	3029360	that the fine tuning problems of physics are important clues when we're moving forward to try
3029360	3033280	to understand the laws of physics better. Whether or not they have anything to do with life,
3033280	3039840	I would not be competent to talk about. And therefore, your feeling is that nobody is competent
3039840	3045120	to talk about that in a fundamental sense. Well, I'm all in favor of talking about it,
3045120	3050320	but remaining humble that we don't know the definition of life, the conditions under which
3050320	3055840	life started, the total set of other possible laws of physics that would allow for life or
3055840	3059280	anything like that. Yeah, and when we talk about life, that's sort of the end result. I mean,
3059280	3065360	we're talking about structure to begin with. Why is there any structure at all that seems to be fine
3065360	3070960	tuned that if various parameters would be off by some argument what it would be, you wouldn't be
3070960	3075600	able to have any structure at all. Everything would collapse into a black hole or would fly
3075600	3083680	apart without structure. And why we have this so-called fine tuning. So the question is from
3083680	3090880	a quantum field theory point of view, is there any color that one can bring to that kind of question?
3091760	3098800	I don't think that quantum field theory really tells us that much specifically about why and
3098800	3105280	where and how complex structures can evolve. It gives us the basic ingredients out of which
3105280	3111680	those complex structures evolve. I will tell you that I have a feeling that a lot of people are
3111680	3118080	too quick to say that if conditions were different, complex structures would not be able to evolve.
3118080	3123520	Because guess what? We're very familiar with our conditions. And I don't think that I could hand
3123520	3127920	most people the standard model of particle physics, and they would successfully predict the
3127920	3134160	periodic table of the elements, much less life and stars and things like that. So again, I just
3134160	3138960	want to be humble about the question if things were different, would we even be able to imagine
3138960	3144880	life coming into existence? I'm just not used to, in our conversations, humility from either one of
3144880	3149520	us. So it's a little- You've got to grow in your life, right? You've got to try out new things,
3149520	3155200	put on new hats. I'll take you as a role model and try to follow your humility,
3156080	3164960	attracting persona. Let's go to some basic, closer-to-truth kinds of questions. We've talked
3164960	3171520	about it before. We like to ask the question, what exists by which we mean, what are the
3171520	3177840	fundamental, irreducible categories of reality as few as possible that are irreducible?
3178800	3184960	Yeah. I mean, of course, I wish I knew the answer to that, but my best guess is a quantum wave
3184960	3190080	function obeying the Schrödinger equation. I think that people get a little confused because
3190080	3196400	they will then want to know, well, a wave function of what? When we're taught quantum mechanics,
3196400	3201920	those of us who went through physics educations, you start with a classical system. Here's a
3201920	3206240	harmonic oscillator. Here's the electromagnetic field, and then you quantize it, and you get a
3206320	3212240	quantum theory of that. I think that's a little bit misleading because nature doesn't work that way.
3212240	3218560	Nature starts quantum mechanical from the beginning. My best guess as the fundamental
3218560	3225360	thing that exists is some kind of quantum state obeying some kind of Schrödinger equation. Of
3225360	3230240	course, what exact kind we're still trying to figure out? The other question we ask is, why is
3230240	3234800	there something rather than nothing? Why anything at all? I can put it in a different way. Is
3235760	3245280	there are there brute facts beyond which we cannot proceed even in principle? And if so,
3245280	3252000	what is in that category of brute fact? Yeah, I'm like 99% sure that there are brute facts,
3252000	3257200	and the existence of the universe itself is one of them. But I don't know exactly which
3257200	3262880	facts are brute facts and which ones are explicable. I would like to be able to understand why the laws
3262880	3269680	of physics look the way they do. But in terms of why the universe exists, I think that will
3269680	3276080	probably just turn out to be an ill-formed question. I think that there's no such thing as
3276080	3282160	the reason why the universe exists. Okay, that's been great, Sean. I love that again. I recommend
3282160	3288080	the book for everyone who really wants to understand quantum mechanics and quantum field
3288080	3294160	theory as the foundation for all these kind of fun questions. So now we have a couple of
3294160	3298720	short questions, and these are designed for a stream of consciousness. Just give me a
3299280	3304560	very quick answer, whatever comes to your mind. So the first one is, what do you think the best
3304560	3308160	theory is to integrate quantum mechanics and general relativity?
3309600	3312720	Spacetime emerging from entanglement in the wave function.
3313440	3319600	Question two, roughly, how long do you think it'll be? How many years will it be to get a
3319600	3325360	general consensus on a theory of everything, whether it's what you just said in terms of
3325360	3328320	integrating quantum mechanics and general relativity or some other theory? I mean,
3328320	3331760	do you think this would be what happened in our lifetimes?
3332400	3337840	I'll say between 50 and 100 years. Okay, here's question three. On a scale of 1 to 10,
3338720	3344480	your confidence level that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct
3344480	3352960	and real? 9.5. And next, on a scale of 1 to 10, your confidence level that the standard model of
3352960	3360320	cosmology, cosmic inflation, the Big Bang, will certainly be refined, but it will not be overthrown.
3361520	3366480	Well, I would say 9.9, but I do not include inflation in the standard model. That's a speculation.
3367280	3374400	Okay, last one on a scale of 1 to 10, your confidence level that the physical world is
3374400	3381360	all there is, that there is no thing that is not physical? 9.99.
3384080	3390560	Okay, well, your humility may have increased since we began speaking, but your opinion of the
3390560	3396320	non-physical has not changed. So we can give you consistency as well as humility.
3398320	3404320	Once again, I love the book. Everybody can learn a great deal from it. I liked how you actually
3404320	3411680	concluded that to understand the particles we're made of, the forces that we interact,
3411680	3417040	is one of humanity's greatest achievements, and you have this very beautiful line at the end.
3417120	3420800	We can all be a little proud of that. So I love that.
3421520	3425280	Thanks very much. I mean, technically, I concluded with an appendix where I talk about
3425280	3430480	Fourier transforms, but you're being very nice to talk about the poetic side of the last chapter.
3430480	3433520	We want to give a little bit of the soft side. Yeah, good.
3433520	3438720	Once again, Quanten feels indeed the entire, Sean's entire series, the biggest ideas in the
3438720	3445040	universe, has my highest recommendation. Viewers can watch Sean's 27 videos and
3445040	3452320	ATV episodes on Closer to Truth, and over 1,500 videos on cosmology and physics,
3452320	3455760	especially their meaning and implications, not all of which Sean would agree with.
3456480	3461520	On the Closer to Truth website and Closer to Truth YouTube channel, thanks everyone for watching.
