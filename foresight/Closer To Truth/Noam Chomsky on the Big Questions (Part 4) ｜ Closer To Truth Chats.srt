1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
of the ape was able to do things that made them think,

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,720
oh, he's asking for a banana.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,120
But when they looked at it closely,

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,200
the nymph was just producing signs

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,840
which somehow got him what he wanted sometimes.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,680
Welcome to Closer to Truth Chats.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,640
Today I'm speaking with Noam Chomsky,

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,840
the distinguished theoretical linguist,

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,480
analytic philosopher, cognitive scientist,

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,320
and public intellectual.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,200
He is Institute Professor Emeritus at MIT

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,400
and Laureate Professor of Linguistics

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,480
at the University of Arizona.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,960
Closer to Truth is presenting this four-part mini series

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,680
with Professor Chomsky.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:52,480
Part four now covers applications of Chomsky's

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,560
linguistic theories to other fields and issues

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,120
and his thoughts, opinions, reflections

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,360
on Closer to Truth themes and big questions.

20
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,600
So Noam, let's begin with an overview of what

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,160
has been called, what you've been called,

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,280
the basic property of language.

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,720
And it's three parts that you've

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,440
talked about, the internal computational system that

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,840
has hierarchically structured, the sensory motor system

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,480
that expresses through externalization, speaking,

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,600
et cetera, and then this internal conception system

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,160
for inference, interpretation planning, what

29
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,200
is we informally call thought.

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,120
So just want to get your sense of this big picture of language.

31
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,360
If you take a look at the human species,

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:47,520
what sharply differentiates it from any organic species

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,520
we know of are two things, possession of language,

34
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,880
possession of thought in any form

35
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,760
that we can grasp what thought is.

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,840
I have two identifying features of a species.

37
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,400
First question that comes to mind

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,080
is what's their relation?

39
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,840
Simplest relation would be identity.

40
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,880
And in fact, that's a fair statement.

41
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,960
It's been understood through history for millennia actually

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,760
that language and thought are intimately related.

43
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,400
Language has historically been called audible thought.

44
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,960
It's the mechanism for constructing

45
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,240
thoughts over an infinite range which we then

46
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,560
can access and use in our various activities.

47
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,680
The internal nature of until the 20th century

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,480
when mathematical theories of computation

49
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,560
were developed clearly and precisely,

50
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,480
it was very difficult to capture the essence of this system.

51
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,800
The last 70 years, we've been able to do it.

52
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,840
What we need, what is somehow coded in our brains

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,560
is a finite procedure, kind of like a program in your laptop,

54
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,640
a finite procedure which generates

55
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,200
an infinite number of hierarchically structured

56
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,880
expressions, each of which is an expression of thought

57
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:40,080
and which can be externalized into some sensory motor medium.

58
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,160
Usually sound could be sign, could even be touch,

59
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,160
sound is the usual one.

60
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,200
That seems to be the basic character of language.

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,640
It's not quite the instrument of thought.

62
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,360
It is thought.

63
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,360
We have thought insofar as we have language.

64
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,840
In any significant sense of thought,

65
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,440
there are a couple of dogs at my feet

66
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:14,640
and they have a kind of thought, but it's finite bounded.

67
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,200
If I say a couple of certain words,

68
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,280
I can say which I won't say and they'll be running to the door.

69
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,800
It's a sort of thought, but it's not what we're doing now

70
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,280
or what humans do normally, constructing modes,

71
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,560
expressions that can be used for reflection, analysis,

72
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,760
planning, inference, all the things that our minds uniquely do.

73
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,520
They basically do with language or with instructions

74
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,040
that language provides to other cognitive systems,

75
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,760
just as the internal language that we have

76
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,000
provides instructions to the articulatory system, which

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,960
we can then pick up and use to pronounce things.

78
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,080
Sort of similar on the side of conceptual analysis,

79
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,680
reflection, thought generally.

80
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,520
That seems to be the general picture.

81
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,960
So if this basic property is really basic,

82
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,040
where and when did it first appear?

83
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,960
I think you've written so much, I'm not sure when this occurred,

84
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,680
but you've said that the origin of mind-dependent,

85
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,240
word-like elements remains a mystery.

86
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,800
Other people don't think it's a mystery,

87
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,200
but you still think it's a mystery?

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,640
Total mystery.

89
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,320
We have no idea.

90
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,760
But we know a lot about it.

91
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,880
So for example, Lyleg Leitman's work

92
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,240
died recently, an outstanding cognitive psychologist

93
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,760
and linguist.

94
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:07,400
She, her work showed that a child of maybe two or three

95
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,080
has an enormous knowledge of language

96
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,000
well beyond anything it can express,

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,680
and particularly with regard to words.

98
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,800
Children pick up words at a fantastic rate.

99
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,920
At that age, they may be picking up one word every waking hour,

100
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,320
pick up on very few presentations, no training,

101
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,880
nothing like that, very little evidence.

102
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,960
And they know the words and all of their richness and complexity.

103
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,920
Then comes the second part, investigating

104
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,880
the character of the words.

105
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,800
And it turns out even the simplest ones, the ones we use

106
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,000
to refer to the things around us,

107
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,680
have rich, complex, internal structure.

108
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,640
So there's a question, two questions.

109
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,960
One, a question of acquisition.

110
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,200
One, a question of evolution.

111
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,160
Question of acquisition is how infants

112
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,280
are able to hit upon the rich, complex notions

113
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,600
that they have mastered at a very early age

114
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,480
with very little data.

115
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,960
One question.

116
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,440
The other question is, where in human evolution did this arise?

117
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:27,120
Well, my own feeling for a long time

118
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,840
was that this was lost in the midst of pre-human history.

119
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,840
I think now that that's mistaken.

120
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,720
If these complex concepts, even notice

121
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:48,360
that even the simplest concepts, tree, desk, person, dog,

122
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,920
whatever you want, even these are extremely complex

123
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,800
in their internal structure.

124
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,960
If such concepts had developed in proto-human history

125
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,080
when there was no language, they would have been useless.

126
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,720
They would have been an accident if they developed,

127
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,560
and they would quickly have been lost because you

128
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,720
can't do anything with them.

129
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,160
So chances are very strong that the concepts developed

130
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,840
within human history at a point where

131
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,200
we had computational systems which satisfy the basic property,

132
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,680
well, that reduces the mystery somewhat.

133
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,720
It means it was within the last couple hundred thousand years,

134
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,360
which is a blink of an eye in evolutionary time.

135
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,120
Anthropological research has succeeded

136
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,640
in giving a fair amount of information

137
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,960
about up to 20,000 or 30,000 years ago

138
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,240
how indigenous cultures, they were quite rich,

139
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,680
indigenous cultures developed and operated.

140
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,160
So this kind of narrowed the time window

141
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,440
in which this evolution presumably took place.

142
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,760
That doesn't solve the problem, but it makes it a little more feasible.

143
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,880
It's during this era that we do begin to get complex, symbolic behavior,

144
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,600
fantastic artwork, evidence of complex societies,

145
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,120
and so on, roughly in this period about 100,000 years.

146
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,760
Would you use the term human to whatever primates were prior

147
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,160
to that language explosion or that language event?

148
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,760
Well, these are just technical usages.

149
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,440
Those are hominids, hominids, homo sapiens,

150
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,160
especially our species, separate species.

151
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,360
Its origins seem to be in the order of two to 300,000 years ago.

152
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,120
Co-terminal with language?

153
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,720
Well, that we don't know, but there's evidence.

154
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,600
Prior to the appearance of homo sapiens,

155
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,520
there's no evidence in the archeological record

156
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,720
for any significant symbolic behavior,

157
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,840
maybe a mark on a stone or something.

158
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,040
The kind of complex behavior that seems to require language

159
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:44,240
doesn't appear before homo sapiens, so that it puts one kind of bound.

160
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,920
We have another firmer bound.

161
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,120
Genomic analysis has now placed the separation of humans

162
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,400
at about at least 150,000 years ago.

163
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,000
So we're now down to a very brief period,

164
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,520
and all known humans have the same language faculty.

165
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:13,720
So it seems clear that the language faculty existed

166
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,880
before the early separation of humans,

167
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,280
which leaves a very small window.

168
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,800
It means something pretty simple must have happened.

169
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,280
50,000 years sounds like a large number, but not in evolutionary time.

170
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,840
In terms of the purpose of language,

171
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,240
it's generally assumed by evolutionary biologists

172
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,480
that communications is the primary purpose,

173
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,640
the driver of it, with analogs from animal communications,

174
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:51,480
whether bird songs or monkey calls that that evolved into human language.

175
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,200
I think you've taken quite the opposite position,

176
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,160
which is not unusual for you to take opposite positions,

177
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:03,440
that language is more an inner mental tool as its driver,

178
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:11,000
or as what it was, as opposed to a linear evolution of communications capabilities.

179
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,640
Well, let me first step back a step.

180
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:22,520
Talking about the purpose of a biological system is not really appropriate.

181
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,800
Biological systems don't have purposes.

182
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,760
They appear, then maybe they're put to use in one or another way.

183
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,800
But if you look at the process of evolution, it really has three stages.

184
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,280
The first stage is something disrupts the existing system,

185
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:47,000
maybe a mutation, maybe symbiosis.

186
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,120
So, sometime a couple billion years ago,

187
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,120
a billion years ago, a bacterium swallowed another microorganism

188
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,920
that led to a disruption of the system.

189
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,680
It's the beginning of eukaryotic cells.

190
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,920
The basis for complex life was an accident.

191
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,720
Well, first the system gets disrupted.

192
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,360
Then the second stage, nature,

193
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:21,120
tries to form the simplest, most elegant solution

194
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,960
to how to deal with this new phenomenon.

195
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
That's the second stage.

196
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:32,680
The third stage is winnowing of the various things that are around,

197
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:39,880
which ones are going to have higher reproductive success, natural selection.

198
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,120
Let me take a look at the language.

199
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,080
The initial stage, some stage of disruption,

200
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,160
evidently produced a recursive function,

201
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,160
a computational procedure that goes on,

202
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,960
that can be coded on a computer effectively.

203
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,880
It's basically what a recursive function is.

204
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,280
So, the first stage that appeared somehow,

205
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,040
presumably some small rewiring of the brain,

206
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,840
led to the appearance of this.

207
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,360
Second stage, nature formed the best possible solution

208
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,120
to how to incorporate this into the brain.

209
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,600
Well, the goal of contemporary linguistics

210
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,520
is to find out what that system is.

211
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,080
But what about the winnowing stage?

212
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,480
That never came for language.

213
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,240
There never was any choice.

214
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,920
Partly maybe because there just wasn't enough time,

215
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,160
but partly for, probably for a deeper reason.

216
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:51,680
When you look into this system that nature constructed in detail,

217
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,680
you find that it's so tightly integrated,

218
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,480
so elegantly put together,

219
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,960
that any modification of it in the whole system collapses.

220
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,760
So, there was just no way to select.

221
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,600
It looks as if selection just didn't operate for language.

222
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,640
At least the core parts of it, it certainly may operate

223
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,520
for peripheral parts.

224
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,240
Now, if we look back at the,

225
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,960
so I think we can't really talk about the purpose of the system.

226
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,400
We can talk about how it's used.

227
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,240
Okay, now if you take a look at how language is used,

228
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,640
sometimes it's used for communication,

229
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,960
like you and I are doing,

230
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,960
but that actually is a very peripheral use.

231
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,240
Almost all of our use of language goes on.

232
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,560
All of our waking hours, most of our sleeping hours,

233
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,680
is just thinking.

234
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,920
We just can't stop, almost impossible to stop.

235
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,240
It takes a tremendous act of will to stop thinking.

236
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,240
That's our overwhelming use of language.

237
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,600
We don't know, we only know what's going on there

238
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,320
from the outside.

239
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,680
We can't introspect into it.

240
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,880
What we call inner speech is not inner speech.

241
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,520
It's externalized speech,

242
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,200
where the articulatories have been put on hold.

243
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,920
What's actually going on,

244
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
we can only discover the way you discover

245
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,560
how the visual system works from the outside.

246
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,200
And that's basically what linguistics is about.

247
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,280
At least the kind that interests me.

248
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,920
Try to find out what this system is

249
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,320
that Mother Nature put together

250
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,720
that is used entirely for thought.

251
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,920
Now there are other reasons for thinking

252
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,600
that communication is a peripheral use of language.

253
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,320
When you look at the nature of this internal system,

254
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,600
you find that there are conflicts

255
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,680
between computational efficiency

256
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,800
and communicative efficiency.

257
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,680
And in every single case,

258
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,000
communicative efficiency is sacrificed

259
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,280
as if nature just didn't care.

260
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,720
It only cared about computational efficiency,

261
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,560
constructing a beautiful internal system,

262
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,720
which is typically the way evolution works.

263
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,000
That's how evolution generally works

264
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,880
for perfectly good reasons.

265
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,240
During the second stage of reconstruction,

266
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,440
nature can't have any idea

267
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,840
how the organism's gonna put it to use

268
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,880
to take a ridiculous example

269
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,680
when nature was designing human beings.

270
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,560
It didn't design ears so that they could keep masks.

271
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,800
Just didn't care.

272
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,080
And it probably didn't care

273
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,200
that humans could use language for communication.

274
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,640
That's the way things seem to be developing.

275
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,240
There is actually no,

276
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,880
the only reason to believe that language

277
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,320
is used for communication,

278
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,040
which is a modern idea incidentally,

279
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,600
is misinterpretations of evolution.

280
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
It somehow must have developed,

281
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,840
you language must develop out of animal systems,

282
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,560
communication systems.

283
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,920
I believe no reason to believe that.

284
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,760
None.

285
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,080
And the evidence is overwhelmingly that it didn't.

286
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,560
There's nothing similar to the basic elements

287
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,480
of language, either the conceptual elements

288
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,920
or the computational ones.

289
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,800
Nothing similar in the animal world.

290
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,640
Animal communication differs from human use of language

291
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,960
in radical ways.

292
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,160
And if the course of evolution was,

293
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,120
as I recently suggested a few moments ago,

294
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,440
it's not gonna have any connection

295
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,880
with animal communication.

296
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,520
Now there, I should say that,

297
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,800
there's a kind of a baby talk Darwinism,

298
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,480
which isn't evolutionary theory

299
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,040
that holds that any complex system

300
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,320
must have developed in very small steps from earlier ones.

301
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,240
Actually Darwin himself believed that,

302
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,240
but that's been shown to be untrue.

303
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,240
There are many sharp changes in evolutionary history

304
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,960
from disruptions of one kind or another,

305
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,440
like eukaryotic cells or mutations and so on,

306
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,080
and many other things.

307
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,880
So are we saying that those who claim that language

308
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,560
is the result of a transformation

309
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,120
of animal language, animal communication?

310
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,120
But does that mean that they are bringing to the question,

311
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,400
what I can only call an ideological bias

312
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,440
that language has to be the small increment development

313
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,840
of what looks similar in previous animals?

314
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,360
First of all, it doesn't look similar.

315
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,080
It looks radically different.

316
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,080
The most elementary features of language

317
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,440
have no analog whatsoever in the animal world.

318
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,680
And remember, our closest relatives,

319
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,680
the higher apes are actually about 12 million years

320
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,360
separate from us in evolutionary time.

321
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,120
So throughout this, they've evolved.

322
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,040
Our common ancestors about six million years ago,

323
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,840
they've evolved, we've evolved.

324
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,680
It's impossible to teach with most intensive efforts.

325
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,200
Impossible to teach the most elementary mimicry of language,

326
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,440
even to higher apes.

327
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,760
Every effort that's been tried has been a total failure.

328
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,920
It's just a common myth.

329
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,760
There's no evidence for it.

330
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,160
What about, I mean, there are claims

331
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,680
that animals of parrots and chimps

332
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,680
have a rudimentary number of words they understand.

333
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,360
You know, your namesake, Nym Chomsky, if I...

334
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,360
Nym Chomsky, how do you interpret that?

335
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,160
It's also true of my dogs, they do better.

336
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,800
The Nym project was a very interesting project.

337
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,200
Very fine scientists involved,

338
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,440
number of them, close friends, former students even.

339
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,440
They tried very hard to raise a chimp from infancy

340
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,800
about the way a human child is raised,

341
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,120
as close to it as they could come.

342
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,000
They worked very hard, very seriously.

343
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,120
For a long time, they thought they were making progress.

344
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,280
Later, when they reviewed their evidence,

345
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,800
they were very careful.

346
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,240
They had a video record of everything that happened.

347
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,040
When that was analyzed, it turned out that it was zero.

348
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,040
The ape was able to do things that made them think.

349
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,760
Oh, he's asking for a banana.

350
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,120
But when they looked at it closely,

351
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,120
turned out that the ape was making random signs.

352
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,400
Maybe banana was in there,

353
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,000
want was in the, a bunch of other things were there,

354
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,120
but the investigators were interpreting it

355
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,480
as Nym wants a banana.

356
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,560
Nym was just producing signs,

357
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,840
which somehow got him what he wanted sometimes.

358
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,080
In fact, it turned out that even the most elementary concept

359
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,080
of an object was Nym could never learn.

360
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:48,360
He had a symbol for apple, but for Nym, it meant an apple,

361
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,360
the place where an apple was,

362
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,160
something was near the apple,

363
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,480
anything associated with apple,

364
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,680
concept apple was impossible.

365
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,440
So, and this has been true.

366
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,400
There are a lot of claims about animal achievements,

367
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,080
but where investigators have been willing

368
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:15,080
to provide actual data, primary data,

369
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
there's nothing that you can't find anything,

370
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,960
which is not very surprising.

371
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,600
It wouldn't be easy to teach us to behave like apes,

372
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,280
which is not ready to build for it.

373
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,600
We didn't evolve to it.

374
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,640
I know some people that would be probably pretty easy

375
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,520
to teach them how to behave like apes,

376
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,520
but that may be just a commentary on my friends.

377
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,160
Nym, you have brought into scientific thinking

378
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,400
the concept of deep structure.

379
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,600
I know that affected me many decades ago,

380
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,920
and I started thinking intellectually about the brain

381
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,640
and about the way everything is structured

382
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,000
and the concept of deep structure

383
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,840
you have embedded in intellectual content.

384
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,080
Now, you later modified that in terms of language,

385
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,360
in terms of minimalism.

386
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,040
We talked about that in the earlier parts,

387
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,360
but what I'd like you to do is just reflect

388
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,000
on the power of the deep structure paradigm

389
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,320
in many diverse fields from architecture, music, politics,

390
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,960
which I know you've had some association with,

391
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,920
certainly cognitive science,

392
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,920
this way of thinking of deep structure.

393
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,080
Just want to get your sense of it.

394
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,080
It's a concept that is ubiquitous in the sciences.

395
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,800
So if you look at a,

396
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,520
suppose I drink a glass of water,

397
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,520
well, I have no idea what the components of it are.

398
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,000
There is an internal underlying structure.

399
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,400
There's hydrogen atoms, oxygen atoms,

400
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,200
lots of other things,

401
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,360
all put together in a complex form

402
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,280
with an underlying rich structure,

403
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,880
which I don't see.

404
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,720
You have to do complex.

405
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,480
It took centuries of serious investigation

406
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,600
to discover what the internal structure

407
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,520
of a water molecule is, okay?

408
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,240
That's deep structure.

409
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,840
All over, we don't see the nature of things.

410
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,320
We see peripheral superficial aspects of them.

411
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,040
Language is the same.

412
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,060
We don't see its internal nature.

413
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,120
We see superficial aspects.

414
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,900
And deep structure happened to be a technical notion

415
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,920
which had a specific meaning,

416
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,920
but the general idea that there is a hidden inner form,

417
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,200
internal structure, not visible to us,

418
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,960
but only can be discovered

419
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,520
through intensive inquiry and investigation.

420
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,640
That's a ubiquitous concept.

421
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,960
And it was understood in the study of language

422
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,840
in the 17th and 18th century.

423
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,000
It was forgotten.

424
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,360
But if you go back to the origins

425
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,920
of the scientific revolution,

426
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,080
Galileo or no, Descartes, others,

427
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,520
they recognized that there's a inner form to language

428
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,080
that we don't see.

429
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,880
Famous Fort Royal Grammar, 1660.

430
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,920
I don't know.

431
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,920
Others, it had something comparable to deep structure.

432
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,560
They didn't call it that.

433
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,400
And they didn't have the means at the time

434
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:37,160
to develop a computational theory that came later.

435
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,320
For example, one of the examples in the Fort Royal Grammar

436
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,960
is the sentence, invisible God created the visible world.

437
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,800
And they argue that underlying this are three propositions.

438
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,080
God is invisible.

439
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,560
The world is visible.

440
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,480
God created the world.

441
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,480
And some kind of operations turned these internal propositions

442
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,960
into invisible God created the visible world.

443
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
It's pretty similar to deep structure.

444
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,440
That's a great example.

445
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,160
The cognitive science revolution transformed,

446
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,720
really it's transformed our lives.

447
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,280
It certainly transformed understanding

448
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,480
how we think in the human sciences

449
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,120
and of course all the computer sciences,

450
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,760
your work in linguistics is given credit

451
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,040
for at least in part, triggering that revolution.

452
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,800
Why is that the case?

453
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,640
Well, first of all, I hate to be a contrarian all the time,

454
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,880
but my own view is that the real cognitive revolution

455
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,480
took place in the 17th century,

456
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,200
along with the rise of modern science.

457
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,880
It's been mostly forgotten, but there were real achievements.

458
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,680
Started mentioning some, there are many others.

459
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,040
I've done a fair amount of work on that.

460
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,120
The second cognitive revolution in the 1950s,

461
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,280
developed mainly in Cambridge mass

462
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,620
where I happened to be a grad student at the time.

463
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,020
If you look at what constituted it,

464
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,860
there were basically two things.

465
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,060
Jerry Fodor, late friend, important cognitive science

466
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:27,540
and philosopher, at once quipped that cognitive science

467
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:32,540
is the study of language and vision, not totally false.

468
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,380
Those are the fields that really developed

469
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,180
a lot of rich investigation of how visual perception

470
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,900
takes place, a lot of study of the nature of language.

471
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,780
And it was all integrated, we all know each other.

472
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:51,820
So Dave Maher is one of the founders of modern visual

473
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,420
science, we were friends and some of his work

474
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,100
was kind of modeled on some of the things

475
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,980
that were being done in language,

476
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,980
but a lot of integration.

477
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,220
So it's kind of understandable.

478
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:13,140
These are two topics that you sort of know how to study.

479
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,020
Other things are very hard to study,

480
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,100
like for example, the nature of concepts.

481
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,260
That's a tough one to try to figure out,

482
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,540
what is the nature of the concept,

483
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,820
tree, river, house, and so on.

484
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,580
Actually here the classical Greece had some answers,

485
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,300
which have been forgotten.

486
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,540
So Aristotle considered this question

487
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,620
in a different framework and his framework was metaphysical.

488
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:47,820
So not what's the meaning of house, but what is a house?

489
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,660
It was the cognitive revolution of the 17th century

490
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,500
that shifted that from metaphysics

491
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,980
to epistemology to cognition.

492
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,980
But in forgetting that Aristotle asks, what's a house?

493
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:06,900
He says it's a combination of matter and form.

494
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,700
The matter is the bricks, the timbers, and so on.

495
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:17,260
The form is the design, characteristic use,

496
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,580
the intention of the architect, all sorts of mental things.

497
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,020
And that's quite correct.

498
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:27,460
Something could look like a house, but not be a house at all.

499
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,580
It's used to store books, it's a library.

500
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,980
It's used to put courses in, it's a stable.

501
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,500
Could be a paperweight for a giant.

502
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,580
What it actually is, you can't tell,

503
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,740
but it's physical character.

504
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,140
I think all the terms that are used for us

505
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,020
when we talk about the world have that character.

506
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:55,500
What the thing is, is largely a mental construction.

507
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,340
And that brings us back to why the Gleitmann's crucial work.

508
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,900
All of these concepts must be basically innate,

509
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,420
or at least they're the elements that constitute them

510
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,940
must be innate, because a child acquires them

511
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,500
on virtually no evidence.

512
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,100
Actually, one of Leila's favorite examples

513
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:24,300
was a young child very early, says things like,

514
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,940
that's not fair.

515
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,500
Try to analyze that.

516
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,180
John Rawls has a huge book on it,

517
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,700
the Foundation of Modern Political Science,

518
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,620
just as his fairness.

519
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:40,260
The concept fair is extremely complex to describe,

520
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,380
but a young child has no trouble noticing

521
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,740
that things aren't fair.

522
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,660
Same with lots of other things.

523
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,260
When people talk about the history of modern computer

524
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,460
science, programming languages, compiler construction,

525
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,380
or automata theory, many give your linguistic work credit

526
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,380
for the conceptual ideas behind those concepts.

527
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,500
What is it about your work in linguistics

528
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:16,740
that has enabled programming to be as accurate as it is?

529
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,860
I wouldn't.

530
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,580
That's much too strong.

531
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,420
I did work on finite automata theory, which

532
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:29,660
had certain relationships to early programming languages.

533
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,020
And there were neutral investigations,

534
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:36,580
cooperative investigations, looking at these contexts.

535
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:42,860
But it's basically forms of formal languages,

536
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,220
properties somewhat similar to natural languages.

537
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:52,500
I worked on them in the early 50s around the period

538
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,500
that programming languages were being developed,

539
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,380
and the two interact in a number of ways.

540
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:03,380
So if you look at a textbook on programming,

541
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,940
you'll find things about, sometimes called

542
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,940
the Chomsky hierarchy, the hierarchy of possible formal

543
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:16,900
languages, which have various analogs in programming theory.

544
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,540
They capture some features of natural language,

545
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:26,580
but they also correspond to certain types of automata,

546
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,420
linear bounded automata, push down storage automata,

547
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:35,260
standard interrelate with formal systems that

548
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,100
capture some of the properties of language, which

549
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,020
is a topic of some interest.

550
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:45,460
But it didn't enable programming.

551
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:50,380
I want to mention some theories of incognitive science

552
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,500
and philosophy that you have attacked.

553
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,620
I don't know of a softer word to accurately describe it,

554
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,980
and want to just get your reflections on it.

555
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,020
After many decades of looking back,

556
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,820
first is behaviorism.

557
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,580
What was it about behaviorism that you found erroneous,

558
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:15,460
and how do you reflect now looking back over the decades?

559
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,500
In my view, behaviorism was a radical departure

560
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,900
from the sciences.

561
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,260
First of all, behaviorism varied.

562
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,180
But the form of behaviorism that was pretty much

563
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,620
dominant in the period of creation

564
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,900
of modern cognitive science was largely

565
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,220
skinnerian behaviorism.

566
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:40,100
It was picked up by Van Quine, one

567
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,260
of the most influential philosophers of language.

568
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:49,620
Work like Word and Object based very explicitly

569
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,620
on operant conditioning, skinnerian behaviorism.

570
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:57,220
And that was all the rage in Cambridge in the 1950s.

571
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,860
It was virtual dogma.

572
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,100
Skinners, William James Lectures,

573
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,540
came out in the late 40s.

574
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,460
The book itself, Herbal Behavior,

575
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,340
came out about a decade later.

576
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,340
But it was whatever it was doing.

577
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,020
Well, there were various chips in the armor

578
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,620
that began to develop.

579
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,980
Some of them were within psychology itself.

580
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,540
So George Miller, one of the founders

581
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,260
of cognitive psychology, a close friend,

582
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,060
worked closely with him for many years.

583
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,980
We published together.

584
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:35,460
Even before this started, he did some crucial experiments

585
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,100
which raised serious questions.

586
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,900
So for example, take the sentence,

587
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,300
and John went to the store from any sentence.

588
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,180
The standard theory of perception of speech

589
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:53,260
was you have a certain guess about the first word,

590
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,660
then you have a guess about the second word,

591
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,460
the probability that you're right both times decreases,

592
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,300
of course.

593
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,660
By the time you get to the last word,

594
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,980
it should be very hard to understand in a long sentence.

595
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,820
Well, George showed that it's the opposite.

596
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,060
You don't understand the early words

597
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,620
until you get to the last word, which

598
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,900
means that you're forming the thought in your mind.

599
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,820
And the thought in your mind is telling you

600
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,180
what those early noises were.

601
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,700
By now, there's lots of work on this.

602
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,180
Well, that just didn't fit at all with behaviorism.

603
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:30,740
There was very important work in neuroscience

604
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:36,660
by Carl Lashley, his work on serial behavior around 1950.

605
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,500
It just totally undercut behaviorism,

606
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,820
showed that there are overall patterns in behavior

607
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,580
that simply just don't work anything

608
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,180
like the waivers' models.

609
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,020
Nobody looked at that.

610
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:54,540
I found it in the early 50s because it was brought to my

611
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:59,260
attention by an art historian, Harsh Piro,

612
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,020
you might be interested in this.

613
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,620
Looked at it, so totally wiped out behaviorism.

614
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:10,260
There was other work going on in European, what's

615
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,500
called ethology, comparative biology,

616
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:18,860
the Lawrence, Timberg, and others,

617
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:23,700
which was foreign to the environment in which cognitive

618
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,180
science grew up.

619
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,460
But the main thing was the work on language

620
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,740
that I and others started doing in the early 50s

621
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:39,100
was completely inconsistent with all behaviorist assumptions.

622
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:43,860
And there was just no connection between them.

623
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,780
You couldn't relate them.

624
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:51,180
And then when Skinner's book appeared,

625
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,220
you could read through it, and you

626
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,980
could see that it's all hand-waving.

627
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,060
There's nothing there.

628
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,460
Incidentally, around that time, even

629
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,380
within the behaviorist framework,

630
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,820
there were cracks developing.

631
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,100
So there was work by some of Skinner's students,

632
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,660
incidentally important work, which

633
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,420
showed that animals just didn't behave

634
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,980
by these pattern paradigms.

635
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,900
That they seemed to be working only

636
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,940
if you picked experimental conditions that essentially

637
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,980
adapted instinctive behavior.

638
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,140
So you can teach a pigeon to play ping-pong

639
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,420
because pigeons peck.

640
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,140
So you can modify the pecking behavior.

641
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,780
But basically, it was all falling apart from many points

642
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,980
of view.

643
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:48,220
And my own view, as it was a bad mistake from the first place,

644
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,860
you don't study any subject by saying,

645
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:55,180
let's keep to the superficial manifestations

646
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,060
and not look at what's going on internally.

647
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,420
You want to understand it?

648
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,140
You're going to have to look at what's going on internally.

649
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,740
You don't see it.

650
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,260
You can't do experiments right on it.

651
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,220
You have to study it in indirect ways,

652
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,980
the way physics, chemistry, biology,

653
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,980
every other subject developed.

654
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,260
Linguistic relativity, the so-called Worf hypothesis,

655
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:21,900
where language determines thought in the strong version

656
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,620
or at least influences thought in the weak version,

657
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:27,540
that the structure of a language affects the speaker's

658
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,340
worldview or cognition.

659
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,660
And therefore, when people have different languages,

660
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:37,380
their perceptions are related to the languages they speak,

661
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:43,220
as opposed to a broad human capability.

662
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,860
That hypothesis, the superior Worf hypothesis,

663
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,500
has been around for 80 or so years.

664
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,220
Investigation of its series of investigation

665
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,540
began in the early 50s.

666
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:02,180
First person to study it was Eric Leneberg.

667
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,020
We were grad students together, personal friend.

668
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,860
He went on to found biology of language.

669
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,220
But his first work was actually as a student

670
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:15,500
on the Worf hypothesis, experimental work.

671
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,780
Couldn't find anything.

672
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,740
Everything you tried, you got some superficial results,

673
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,980
but nothing.

674
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,260
Well, it's now 75 years later.

675
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,700
There isn't a lot more to say.

676
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,140
There's some evidence.

677
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:34,500
Some of the Lila Gleitman, who I mentioned before,

678
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,020
carefully analyzed and did experimental work

679
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,540
on some of the alleged evidence that fell apart.

680
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,180
There's a few things around that seem possible,

681
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:51,540
but pickings are very slim.

682
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,220
I mean, there's some respects in which it's obviously true.

683
00:40:54,220 --> 00:41:00,340
So as Leneberg pointed out, 75 you found, 75 years ago,

684
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:08,420
if you study a language that we have a distinction between red

685
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,180
and orange and pink, say, but their languages don't.

686
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,220
They haven't been studying Hopi.

687
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,100
Just use the same word for that spectrum.

688
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,220
So he found perfectly predictably

689
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,820
that if you use, say, memory texts, tests,

690
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,820
did you ever see that?

691
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:30,540
Did you see this shade of color a minute ago?

692
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,100
You'll do better if you have names.

693
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,260
So in a way, the language affects perception,

694
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,380
but in such a trivial way that it's of no interest.

695
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,900
And there isn't much more than that.

696
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:49,380
Logical positivism, which was the rage in the early 20th century

697
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,780
that said that really there are only two kinds of truths

698
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:57,900
and even only two kinds of intellectual activities

699
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,580
worth pursuing, those that are empirical

700
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,860
with a scientific method and those that are purely

701
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,660
logical with a deduction.

702
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,620
Everything else is basically non-stets.

703
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,740
Well, logical positivism was an important movement

704
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:16,620
in the 20s, early 30s.

705
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:21,940
By the late 30s, its major figures

706
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,100
were drifting away from it.

707
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:32,420
Karnap, Temple, others, Quine, just moving away from it.

708
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:37,900
And it became influential in linguistics and psychology

709
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:43,220
after it was declining philosophy and declining

710
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,140
for good reasons.

711
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,580
There were internal critiques.

712
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,820
But it did have a big influence on linguistics

713
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:56,100
through Leonard Bloomfield, who saw himself as a strict.

714
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,340
He was the major linguist in the early 20th century.

715
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:02,420
He did very good work in many areas.

716
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,940
But in this area, he was very much misled

717
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:10,940
by picking up an early form of logical positivism, which

718
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,660
was not viable.

719
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:17,220
But so I think it's an important, made important contributions,

720
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:22,100
important residue, developed sense in other directions.

721
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:27,980
So if you look at Quine, Copper, Karnap, major figures,

722
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:32,940
Wittgenstein was totally rejected.

723
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:39,700
Then it just is no longer a coherent viable movement.

724
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,660
What is your view of contemporary field

725
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:47,380
or subfield of philosophy of language, which subsumes

726
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,180
a great deal of what we're talking about and even more

727
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:50,820
than that?

728
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,980
What are the categories?

729
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,540
What are your reflections on it?

730
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,140
Well, I've been a pretty short critic of it.

731
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,820
I've been book after book.

732
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,940
I don't want to go through that.

733
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,460
I mean, there is important work.

734
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:07,460
But a lot of it, I think, is seriously misguided.

735
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,180
I could go into details if written about it.

736
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,220
So for example, take, say, Quine,

737
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:16,140
who was the Quine and Wittgenstein

738
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:21,100
to the leading figures of modern philosophy of language.

739
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:24,900
Both of them accepted for Quine, who

740
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,900
was a strict Schenarian.

741
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:32,180
Language, in his words, is a complex of dispositions

742
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:36,900
to respond to present stimuli.

743
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,060
There's nothing to do with language.

744
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,620
I mean, it didn't develop that way.

745
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,740
It's not used that way.

746
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,580
Wittgenstein, the late Wittgenstein,

747
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,980
who was interested in language, it was kind of aphoristic.

748
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,620
You know, try to give an organized system.

749
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,020
But if you look at his comments on acquisition of language,

750
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,540
they're strict behaviorist.

751
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:05,140
You know, his language games, somebody

752
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:10,780
is showing a rock and somebody says rock and imitated.

753
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:12,780
That's how you learned rock.

754
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:14,780
Nothing like that happens.

755
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,820
I mean, there's tons of experimental evidence by now,

756
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,580
even just observational evidence.

757
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:25,940
And I think while there are doubtless major contributions,

758
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,780
some of them, a lot of the work, I think,

759
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,780
is off on the wrong track.

760
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:34,020
So the main contributions, I think, have been in semantics.

761
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,580
Donald Davidson's work on event semantics

762
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:40,500
has turned out to be very productive and influential.

763
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:46,220
It was picked up by Languist philosophers, James Higginbotham,

764
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:50,660
Paul Trotsky, others, and it's turned into, my view,

765
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,980
one of the most promising approaches

766
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,940
to the general semantics of language.

767
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,300
It's called philosophy.

768
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,740
I don't know why it's called philosophy.

769
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,060
It's basically a good, serious study

770
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,580
of the semantics of natural language.

771
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,660
Analytics philosophy versus continental philosophy.

772
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,180
You're classified as an analytic philosopher.

773
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,580
You've had some engagements with continental philosophers

774
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,580
famously.

775
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:19,540
What is your reflection on the dichotomy

776
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,460
between them, the artificial?

777
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,340
How do you see going forward?

778
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,420
Well, actually, a good deal of my work

779
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:35,020
is on continental philosophy from the 17th through the 19th

780
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:49,500
century, Descartes, Hume, Locke, onto the philosophers

781
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,980
of Humboldt on through the 19th century.

782
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:59,500
Contemporary continental philosophy is quite different.

783
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,420
There's work that I find interesting,

784
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:06,220
close to a number of others.

785
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:11,780
But most of the modern work, either I don't understand it

786
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:15,700
or I don't find it very interesting.

787
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,180
My own background is in what's called analytic philosophy,

788
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,900
though I was, as I've just mentioned,

789
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,740
I've been rather critical of a lot of the ways it's developed.

790
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:31,540
But I think basically on the way to finding

791
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:35,420
serious understanding of the way the mind works,

792
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,980
the way the world works.

793
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:38,980
What I'd like to do now, Nome, and I've really

794
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:43,020
been looking forward to this, is to get your quick sense

795
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,500
of some of the big questions that we

796
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,580
ask on Close to the Truth, the themes that

797
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:54,580
are the core of our work over two decades now.

798
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:59,300
And we've asked these questions to all leading

799
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:03,260
scientists, mainly physicists, philosophers,

800
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:05,500
neuroscientists, et cetera, and just

801
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,140
want to get your sense.

802
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:10,580
So we'll start with philosophy of mind,

803
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,300
which is a very broad category.

804
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,900
But from your point of view, what

805
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,740
have been the major issues or the problems

806
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,540
in philosophy of mind, and where have you

807
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:22,380
staked your own personal claims?

808
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,500
I don't know how to distinguish philosophy of mind

809
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,820
from science of mind.

810
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:32,940
The science and philosophy were pretty much

811
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,860
the same field until the 19th century.

812
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:41,340
Then the names diverged, but not in a serious way.

813
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:47,900
So the most serious work in cognitive science, in my view,

814
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,980
is a development of a suggestion by clock John

815
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:57,100
Locke in the wake of Isaac Newton's discoveries, who

816
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,780
showed that the mechanical conception

817
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:04,140
of the nature of the world that was developed in modern science

818
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,540
just didn't work.

819
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:10,940
So Locke concluded, he phrased it in his theological framework.

820
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,260
I'll drop that.

821
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:17,700
But just as the material world has properties

822
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,860
that we cannot comprehend, but that

823
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:26,340
are there like interaction without contact.

824
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:32,100
So the mind might just be, let me take it in his theological

825
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,620
framework, because it sounds better, just as God provided

826
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,780
matter with properties that we cannot understand,

827
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,460
like interaction without contact.

828
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:47,620
So God might have super-added to matter

829
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:51,140
the certain forms of matter the property of thought,

830
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:55,780
meaning thought is a property of some organized form of matter,

831
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:58,580
whatever matter turns out to be.

832
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,940
That's a fundamental insight.

833
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:05,140
And it was developed carefully through the 19th, 18th century

834
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,340
by major figures.

835
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:10,980
It culminated in Joseph Priestley's work.

836
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,260
Famous chemist, philosopher, distinction

837
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,660
wasn't made in those days.

838
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:18,140
Then it was pretty much forgotten.

839
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,700
It was rediscovered in the latter decades

840
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,660
of the 20th century.

841
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:28,780
It was then considered a radical new idea in philosophy,

842
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:33,580
astonishing hypothesis, new thesis in biology.

843
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:37,500
Actually Locke's suggestion on the work that was done on it.

844
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:41,260
So that's a core part of philosophy of mine, I think,

845
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:48,140
finding out what it is in the structure of the world,

846
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,980
whatever the world is constituted of,

847
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:52,220
that has this property of thought.

848
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,220
Well, that's the kind of thing we were talking about before.

849
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:57,540
And there are many mysteries there.

850
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:00,340
One of them, by mystery, I mean things

851
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,340
in which there's been no progress for millennia.

852
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,100
One question is what we were talking

853
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,420
about, the nature of concepts, where to come from,

854
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,260
how to people acquire it.

855
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:16,140
Another one is simply what was crucial for Descartes,

856
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:19,780
the fact that our ordinary use of language

857
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,420
is constantly innovative.

858
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:26,460
New things that were never said before, they're not random.

859
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:31,660
They're appropriate to situations, not caused by situations.

860
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:35,220
I've called it the creative aspect of language use,

861
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:38,660
total mystery, nobody knows where that comes from.

862
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,380
Actually nobody knows anything about voluntary action,

863
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,900
but this is a complex case of it.

864
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,220
So that's another major problem.

865
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,900
There are other problems about, you can go on,

866
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:53,020
problems about what constitutes thought,

867
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:56,500
what the animals do, how is human thought different

868
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,060
from the cognition of other organisms.

869
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:03,300
These are mixtures of philosophy and science,

870
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,060
which I don't think divide very clearly.

871
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:10,980
Philosophers are studying some of the more general aspects

872
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,100
of what the science is doing.

873
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,820
And plenty of people just cross the boundaries.

874
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,260
Don't pay any attention.

875
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,900
Are you committed to a purely materialistic,

876
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:27,900
physicalism approach to anything having to do with the mind?

877
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,260
Another way to put it is,

878
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:33,780
what is the ontological status of the mental?

879
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:35,460
To be contrary, and again,

880
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,020
I've always taken exactly the opposite position.

881
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:43,740
In my, as I've argued at some length,

882
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:47,780
there was a concept of matter

883
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:51,220
in the early scientific revolution.

884
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,220
It's called the mechanical philosophy.

885
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,740
The world is a complex machine,

886
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:00,140
a much more complex and intricate version

887
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:04,100
of what skilled artisans were developing

888
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:06,580
all around Europe at the time.

889
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:10,340
The world is just a far more complex variant of that.

890
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:14,700
That was held right through the major part

891
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,020
of early modern science.

892
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:21,860
Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Leibniz, Huygens,

893
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,860
all the great scientists assumed this.

894
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,380
Newton disproved it.

895
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:31,140
He showed that the world is not a machine in a sense.

896
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:32,380
He didn't believe it.

897
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,180
He thought it was the most so absurd

898
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,380
that nobody with any scientific understanding

899
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,540
could possibly believe this.

900
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,580
And that's why he called his major book,

901
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:46,500
mathematical principles, not physical principles.

902
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,020
He said, I don't have a physical theory.

903
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:53,340
All I have is mathematical principles that seem to work.

904
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,940
He was sharply condemned for by Leibniz

905
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,500
for the great figures.

906
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,580
Well, at that point, the concept of matter disappeared.

907
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,380
Matter is just whatever we postulate

908
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,020
in our best theories of the world.

909
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:10,500
There's no bounds.

910
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,740
If it turns out to be massless particles,

911
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,460
okay, it's massless particles.

912
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,260
Turns out to, whatever it turns out to be,

913
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,700
that's what it is.

914
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:23,260
But there's no fixed notion

915
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,260
of the material or the physical.

916
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,580
Some philosophers try to hang on to it.

917
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:33,740
Say, well, maybe the physical is spatio-temporal.

918
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,500
Now we're back to Locke's suggestion.

919
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:42,180
My thinking does not take place in my feet.

920
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:45,420
It doesn't take place in a tree outside.

921
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,620
It takes place up here.

922
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:51,700
So it's spatio-temporally contained.

923
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:54,900
So therefore, all of mine is physical.

924
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,820
Since the word essentially has no meaning,

925
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:02,460
just whatever our best theories say,

926
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,300
you can say that if you want.

927
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,340
But I think the question's just disappeared.

928
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,900
There is no coherent notion of materialism

929
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,700
as far as I can see.

930
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,700
It's just whatever the science has come up with

931
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:19,540
as their best explanations, that's materialism.

932
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:23,380
The trend in philosophy of mine in the last decades

933
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:27,900
has been moving away from what is classically called

934
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,900
materialism, that everything mental can be reduced

935
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,380
in some way in some future science,

936
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:37,300
maybe not for a thousand years,

937
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,940
to physical processes in the brain,

938
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,580
whether it's at the neuronal level

939
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,540
or the internal neuronal level

940
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,260
or the quantum physical level,

941
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,420
but still physical within the brain.

942
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:53,780
And so many philosophers today are moving away from that

943
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:57,900
and say that we'll never be able to explain the qualia,

944
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,140
the inner experience that we all have,

945
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,220
and that you need to go beyond

946
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,300
what is traditionally called physicalism,

947
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,460
whether it's panpsychism,

948
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:11,180
where everything has a little bit of mental capacity

949
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,820
or some kind of dualism

950
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,860
where there's a non-physical reality interacting,

951
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:19,140
but there has been a trend in that direction

952
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,420
that purely physical explanation of the brain

953
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,740
will never fully explain the mental.

954
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,860
Well, the problem with that is

955
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,600
there is no notion of physical.

956
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:33,860
Actually, this was put very well

957
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:37,780
by fine psychologist, Gell and Strossen,

958
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:40,660
who does commit a depend psychism.

959
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,700
But he was talking about consciousness.

960
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,620
He said, there's no problem about consciousness.

961
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,820
We all know exactly what it is.

962
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:50,940
Consciousness is what I'm experiencing now.

963
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,660
The problem is with the physical.

964
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,940
When you talk about reducing consciousness to physical,

965
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,100
you don't know what physical is.

966
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:02,420
Physical is just whatever the sciences say.

967
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,420
So consciousness is gonna be part of it.

968
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,300
Actually, it goes back to Russell pretty much.

969
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,980
And I think that's correct.

970
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:11,860
There is no physicalism.

971
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:15,860
So whatever's going on in my mind

972
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:18,500
and your mind is in your brains.

973
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,740
It's not going on somewhere else.

974
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,580
Well, the brains are,

975
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,460
if the brain isn't a physical object,

976
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:26,140
I don't know what is.

977
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:29,700
So therefore, it's going on in your brain.

978
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,060
It's some sort of process going on in there,

979
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,220
not anywhere else.

980
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,780
The rest is just idle talk.

981
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:40,780
But Galen Strausson, who's a very good example

982
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,100
and people can see his videos on Closer to Truth.

983
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:44,900
He's a good friend.

984
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:49,740
He would say that you need to have some deeper understanding

985
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:54,740
of the nature of all physical properties

986
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:58,380
in order to understand how the brain can generate

987
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,780
in some way, the concept of consciousness.

988
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,940
You put in the word physical.

989
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:08,060
You have to, as I understand his views,

990
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,700
which I think I agree with,

991
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,780
you have to have an understanding of the nature of the world

992
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:17,700
in order to find how the mind functions.

993
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,900
Because the mind is just part of the world

994
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:25,620
as Locke famously should be famously,

995
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,660
unfortunately he's forgotten.

996
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:29,820
But as he pointed out,

997
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,820
there's no reason not to regard

998
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,580
thinking as a property of organized matter.

999
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:38,180
Whatever matter turns out to be,

1000
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,140
we don't know what's gonna turn out to be.

1001
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:42,260
Sure, I think that is an approach

1002
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,860
that there's an expanded understanding

1003
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,500
of what reality is that we call matter and something else.

1004
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:51,380
But whatever it is, that's the total reality of the world.

1005
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,300
And there may be things

1006
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,140
that we totally don't understand that now,

1007
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,700
whether it's panpsychism or something else.

1008
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,460
I don't go along with Strausson

1009
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:03,860
as far as he does to the panpsychism.

1010
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:08,860
That is argument for panpsychism is based on a serious point.

1011
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:13,100
Can there be what he calls radically emergence?

1012
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:18,140
Tirely new properties somehow developing

1013
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:23,140
without any elements of them in earlier structures.

1014
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,340
I think that happens all the time.

1015
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,620
There's nothing in the hydrogen atom,

1016
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,340
which says you're a liquid.

1017
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:37,340
Changes take place with levels of complexity increasing

1018
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:41,140
that bring about entirely new phenomena.

1019
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,380
So I don't, that's a strong argument.

1020
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:47,780
The critical mass of an atomic bomb is a good example

1021
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:49,580
where you have uranium-235,

1022
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,860
a certain purity of it,

1023
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:54,580
and it'll be inert, it'll be radioactive,

1024
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:57,660
but you add one more microgram

1025
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,260
and then you have an atomic bomb

1026
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,780
because it hits that critical mass.

1027
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,460
It's a simple analogy, but...

1028
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,260
It's just that everything in nature is like that.

1029
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:11,380
Back to eukaryotic cells, which I meant, or water.

1030
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:15,180
The properties of water aren't detectable

1031
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:16,740
in hydrogen and oxygen.

1032
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,020
But this is a critical point,

1033
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,340
and I'm gonna push it a little bit further,

1034
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:21,540
because with hydrogen and oxygen,

1035
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,780
we can understand how,

1036
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:27,660
when you understand the science of bonding and flow

1037
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:30,460
and molecules slipping by one another,

1038
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,700
that with advanced science,

1039
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:37,700
you can, in fact, predict or reverse engineer

1040
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,100
from when you know the structure

1041
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:43,300
to why that becomes liquid.

1042
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,540
Now, the question is,

1043
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:48,460
is everything about the mind of that same character

1044
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,580
where eventually science,

1045
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:54,300
given as much time as you want, 10,000 years,

1046
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:55,740
be able to access it?

1047
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,420
Or are there aspects of the mental

1048
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:02,580
that are forever beyond the purview of science?

1049
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:05,700
No more than aspects of motion.

1050
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,500
Go back to Newton and Leibniz.

1051
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,860
They had no problem understanding

1052
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:14,300
Newton's theories of gravity.

1053
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:17,380
Okay, it was what they described

1054
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,820
that was unintelligible.

1055
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:22,940
We cannot conceive, as Locke said,

1056
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:26,580
we cannot conceive of objects interacting

1057
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,140
in a mechanical fashion.

1058
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:32,100
And we can't, it's a fact.

1059
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,300
Science just gave up the task of trying to.

1060
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,620
Galileo through Newton and Leibniz,

1061
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,540
science was trying to develop a picture

1062
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:47,100
of an intelligible world that was given up.

1063
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:49,180
We don't try to do that anymore.

1064
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:53,780
We try to find intelligible theories of the world,

1065
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:55,620
like Newton's theory,

1066
01:01:55,620 --> 01:02:00,620
or the theory of how hydrogen and oxygen molecules

1067
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:04,740
yield water, but it's not intelligible.

1068
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:08,560
We can't, we have no grasp of what's going on.

1069
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,740
We understand the theory, we can follow it,

1070
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:12,520
as you say, we predicted.

1071
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:16,860
That's now the goal of science for hundreds of years,

1072
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:19,420
since basically since Newton,

1073
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:22,100
which abandoned the Galilean hope

1074
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:26,900
of developing an intelligible world.

1075
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:30,180
So can you do that for the mind?

1076
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,140
No reason why.

1077
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,340
Maybe we can't, maybe we don't have

1078
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:39,300
the intellectual capacity to do it,

1079
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:42,060
but that doesn't mean there's no explanation for it.

1080
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:47,580
I mean, we're not angels, we're organisms.

1081
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:52,580
Our mental capacities have certain scope, certain limits,

1082
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:57,260
but no reason to believe that we can understand everything.

1083
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:59,100
So in the philosophy of science,

1084
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:02,540
would you classify yourself as an anti-realist

1085
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:07,540
in the sense that we have access to empirical information,

1086
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:10,620
we can sense regularities,

1087
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:14,620
but there's really no hope of understanding reality

1088
01:03:14,620 --> 01:03:17,140
as it is quite reality in itself.

1089
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:18,100
No, I don't.

1090
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,340
We can understand it to the extent

1091
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,980
that humans are capable of understanding things.

1092
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:27,300
We are, I don't know about you,

1093
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:31,780
but I have no grasp of,

1094
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:35,940
I can follow the theory that explains how hydrogen

1095
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:40,460
oxygen end up feeling like a liquid,

1096
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,220
but I don't have any grasp of it.

1097
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:45,060
I can follow the theory, okay?

1098
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:47,100
And that's the way science works.

1099
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:52,740
I have no grasp of it, field of force, let's say.

1100
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:57,020
I understand it can work with vector spaces and so on,

1101
01:03:57,020 --> 01:04:01,540
but that doesn't give me what Tom Nagel

1102
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,580
calls a feeling of what it is.

1103
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:07,620
We don't have a feeling of that about anything,

1104
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:13,780
but we can do the best we can to try to find theories

1105
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:17,660
that explain the properties that we discovered.

1106
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:21,580
Now we can understand the theories, maybe get better ones.

1107
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:25,100
Can we get good enough ones to explain,

1108
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,820
say, elements of consciousness?

1109
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:29,340
You never know.

1110
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:32,860
You can, you know, as you learn and study more,

1111
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:36,180
you find more, then you find more problems.

1112
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,980
Not science, you know, it's like hill climbing.

1113
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:42,060
You climb a hill, you think you've gotten somewhere,

1114
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:44,660
you look up and there's a big hill.

1115
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:46,940
It's all the whole history of science.

1116
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:49,060
No, one of the questions we'd love to ask

1117
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:52,940
on Close to the Truth is a two-word question,

1118
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:56,340
two-word sentence, what exists?

1119
01:04:56,340 --> 01:05:00,940
And by that, what we mean are what are the minimum number

1120
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:04,460
of non-reducible categories that you need

1121
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,740
to explain all of reality?

1122
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:12,740
Science has its own answers, partial answers.

1123
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:16,660
So they might say elementary particles.

1124
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:22,420
Then you pick up a quantum theory journal

1125
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:26,380
and you find a symposium of great scientists

1126
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,260
about what is a particle?

1127
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,780
All kind of views.

1128
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:34,700
Basically, we know some things about it,

1129
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,660
but we really don't know what a particle is.

1130
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:39,700
Okay, so you go on to the next step.

1131
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:45,100
I don't think these are questions that can have answers.

1132
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,980
They have answers, but only answers

1133
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:50,660
that you move towards as you learn more.

1134
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:53,140
How far you'll go is never anyway to know.

1135
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:57,980
Along the way, you cast aside problems

1136
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,340
as ones we can't deal with,

1137
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:06,340
the way science afternoon cast aside the problem of motion.

1138
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,780
You go back to the 17th century,

1139
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:12,700
they had a concept of hard problem.

1140
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,100
Today, the fashion is to say

1141
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:18,020
that the hard problem is consciousness.

1142
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:22,340
17th century, what they called the hard problem was motion.

1143
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:26,700
Problem was never solved, it was abandoned.

1144
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,740
And then the last question,

1145
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:31,660
which in one sense is the very first question

1146
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,860
that we'd love to ask is,

1147
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:35,860
why is there something rather than nothing?

1148
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:38,180
Why is there anything at all?

1149
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:40,180
And the question I want to ask you,

1150
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:42,660
is that a legitimate question to ask?

1151
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,980
Because we ask it, but one of the claims

1152
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:47,380
is that that's not a question

1153
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:50,020
that you should be able to ask.

1154
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,540
Well, the best answer to that that I heard

1155
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:57,820
was by a great philosopher, personal friend,

1156
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:59,500
you know, Sidney Morgan Besser.

1157
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:03,380
Sid was asked that once, and he said,

1158
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:06,700
look, if there was nothing, you'd be fetching about that.

1159
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:11,220
Covetching in terms of our common answers,

1160
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:12,300
this means complaining.

1161
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,580
I learned that from my grandmother.

1162
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:18,820
No, and this has been an absolute delight.

1163
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:20,340
I wish we could go on forever.

1164
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:22,380
You have made such contributions,

1165
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,660
not just to linguistics,

1166
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:27,700
but to ways of thinking, challenging us in linguistics,

1167
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,060
certainly in political science,

1168
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:31,980
even if some of us may disagree

1169
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:35,020
with some of the things that you say in all categories,

1170
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:37,700
you've had a tremendous contribution

1171
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:40,940
to intellectual thought, to the enjoyment

1172
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:45,500
and the appreciation of reality over these seven decades

1173
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,020
for you, certainly my entire lifetime,

1174
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:51,060
on a personal basis, it's great to experience

1175
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:53,700
this real interaction with you now.

1176
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,820
As I said, we met at MIT very briefly, 40 years ago.

1177
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,460
So it's just a great pleasure for me.

1178
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,500
And I look forward to another session,

1179
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,580
70 or so years from now.

1180
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,620
We'll discuss some of the same things

1181
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:10,580
and see how you've progressed over that time.

1182
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:12,700
We'll have the same mysteries, I think.

1183
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:15,020
All the best, all the best.

1184
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,380
Thank you.

1185
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:17,380
Good to be with you.

1186
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:20,980
Thank you for watching.
