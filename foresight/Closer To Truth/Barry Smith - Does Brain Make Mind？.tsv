0	5200	Barry, when we try to understand what our mental state is, what our mind is, we know
5200	11120	the brain does it. But how does it do it? What are the mechanisms by which the brain
11120	16720	gives us what we think is the mind? Well, I think the mechanisms are beginning to show us how much
16720	22560	colouring, shading, structuring and form is going into a single conscious episode. It's
22560	27840	interesting that what happens at any moment in consciousness depends on many things that happen
27840	34000	outside that moment elsewhere, both what's gone on before and how the brain is anticipating what's
34000	41040	coming next, and also your recognition of familiar objects, familiar faces, a familiar smell.
41040	46160	Now, when all of that information is being assembled, our job and the brain's job it seems
46160	53120	is to provide me, to provide my conscious mental state with something recognisable, familiar and
53120	58880	a clue to what's going on in my environment. So we're using internal clues, external clues,
58880	63840	to provide a single experience that gets me around the world and tells me what's going on out there
63840	69200	and with me. So you're relating memory systems that you have, all of your senses together.
70160	77920	How many different modules, if you will, mental modules come in to give this sense of
78880	84960	of normality that we have, which we know comes from a huge number of different kinds of inputs.
84960	88880	A huge number of different kinds of inputs. And I think some of the inputs we don't recognise
88880	94400	is occurring at all. Take the sense of smell, terribly important, but often goes unnoticed.
94400	99680	So we think we're relying on our vision and we're relying on our hearing a lot. But sense of smell
99680	105280	is giving you something like familiarity. Is this my own home? Because when I walk in it will
105280	109920	smell the way it should. Now, I don't notice it because I'm so used to it. But if I lost my sense
109920	116080	of smell, that would make the place I was now familiar with seem eerie, strange, unfamiliar.
116080	121040	So I think we're getting signals all the time from various different senses. We're getting
121040	127200	signals perhaps from different kinds of visual systems, not just what are the recognisable
127200	132320	objects, but how near are they to me? Can I reach for them? So we treat things that are within our
132320	137680	peripersonal space, the kind of sphere of operation of our reach very differently from
137680	142240	things that are outside it. I might have no such attachment to a cup that's over there
142240	148960	as to one that's right by my arm. So huge numbers of very delicate operations are going on all the
148960	156800	time across many ranges of sensory inputs to give a structured and a rich experience that
156880	163440	makes me poised for action, familiar in my environment, and also comfortable with myself.
163440	169520	So we're talking about the senses part of how the brain makes the mind. But there are other
169520	178800	pieces as well, language, for example, or different kinds of memory systems that are emotional,
178800	185120	as opposed to sensorial. So how about some of these big systems that work together? I mean,
185120	191600	sensory is one category and there are many subcategories, but how many of these big categories
191600	196480	are integrating together? Yes, I mean, there's overlay. I mean, we're never without our senses.
196480	200640	The idea that we're having experience with our senses switched off is nonsense. So there's
200640	205040	always sensory information providing a lot of the texture in the background. But of course,
205040	211600	what's going on in consciousness has to be captured and related to other moments in our life. We're
211600	217440	quite often very interested in how we make sense of the here and now by what we previously saw or
217440	222880	experienced. And some of the things that will track across those separate episodes will be memory,
223600	229840	partly episodic memory, have I been here before, but also semantic memory when I'm classifying
229840	236480	things as of a certain kind, recognizably of the same type. It's that kind of car, it's that kind
236480	243360	of bottle and so on. Now, when I'm dealing with the world around me, there's always a level of
243360	249120	appreciation of how I feel about it. So you've got this constant modulation of your state of
249120	255120	consciousness by your emotions. And then on top of that, of course, we want to classify, capture,
255120	261120	and make precise some of the things that would otherwise quickly fade from consciousness. And
261120	266640	I think language is very good at anchoring our experience. It gives us a way of locking on to
266640	272160	and locking down some parts. Also, of course, gives us a way of coordinating our conscious
272160	277200	experience with one another. Because by using certain words, I can put you in mind of I can
277200	282480	actually rearrange your experience to make you think about things that aren't here. If I start
282480	286560	talking about New York or Chicago, we're not there. But of course, somehow your mind can
286560	293200	flip there very easily. Now that magic of words, which allows us to transport the mind outside
293200	299440	the moment of consciousness, is a large part of what gives us extended minds, minds that can
299440	305520	communicate one with another. So one way in which the brain makes the mind is giving us new insights
305520	310000	into why the mind experiences things the way it does. And of course, when we're at the level of
310000	315760	mind, it all seems to be very easy to understand just from reflecting on our own experience.
315760	322240	But new work on the brain is actually casting light on why our experience patterns the way it
322240	327680	does, why it has the form and character it does. Here's some unexpected surprises. So it turns out
327680	333680	there are certain aromas that are often used in shampoo that make your hair feel softer. So it
333680	338320	turns out that smell is having an impact on touch. It's making what you feel at the end of your
338320	344240	fingers change. Similarly, aromas and certain foods can make them taste creamier. So that's an
344320	349280	unexpected way in which that sounds bizarre. It sounds bizarre. And yet this is something we
349280	354720	wouldn't have known unless we were able to drill down into how the brain is actually making and
354720	360480	manufacturing those those touch experiences. Here's another one. When we're eating potato chips,
360480	366160	and we leave them out for a day or two out of the packet, they go stale. They're not very nice to
366160	372240	eat. Stale, of course, is just that they crumble differently in the mouth. But if you put on headphones
372240	378560	and you amplify the high frequency sound of your own crunching, they taste fresh. So again,
378560	382800	who would have thought that sound would have an impact on flavour? So this way in which
383440	389280	single experiences that we think are coming from a very easily recognisable source are actually
389280	394800	concoctions that depend on a collaboration of senses to produce that effect. And so now we're
394800	400480	beginning to understand our experience better by seeing precisely how the brain makes these
400480	403680	moments in mind.
