00:00.000 --> 00:07.240
Barry, in discussions between philosophers and neuroscientists there's this great debate

00:07.240 --> 00:11.840
and what I like to do sometimes is to look at the extremes.

00:11.840 --> 00:19.580
And one extreme which has been called neurophilosophy is that everything in philosophy ultimately

00:19.580 --> 00:22.560
has to be understood in terms of the brain.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.560
There's nothing else.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.860
Everything else just doesn't exist.

00:25.860 --> 00:31.500
On the other hand, the term has been called neuromania, which is that thinking that everything

00:31.500 --> 00:42.380
in terms of the brain is also a fallacy and that it is the irrigation of brain scientists

00:42.380 --> 00:46.820
to think they can explain everything by the physical activities of the brain.

00:46.820 --> 00:48.940
So how do we compare these two extremes?

00:48.940 --> 00:50.460
Can we learn anything from that?

00:50.460 --> 00:54.100
Well, we should be Goudaist Italians and think it's the doctrine of the mean that's

00:54.100 --> 00:55.700
going to be somewhere in the middle.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.460
Now, neurophilosophy, I don't like the term.

00:58.460 --> 01:02.420
I think there's neuroscience and philosophy collaborating with one another.

01:02.420 --> 01:04.380
The philosophers should still be philosophers.

01:04.380 --> 01:08.180
That's how they can contribute to the job of the neuroscientists to help understand the

01:08.180 --> 01:10.900
foundations and the fundamentals of the work.

01:10.900 --> 01:13.420
Equally the neuroscientists should not be amateur philosophers.

01:13.420 --> 01:15.940
So I don't like, I like them collaborating.

01:15.940 --> 01:18.500
I don't like them fusing and merging.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.460
So I do think there's a danger.

01:21.460 --> 01:26.180
Similarly, I think neuroscience is at its worst when it tries to be ultra reductionist.

01:26.180 --> 01:29.060
In fact, some of the best neuroscience today is not reductionist.

01:29.060 --> 01:33.020
Cognitive neuroscience takes very seriously the fact that we're creatures with beliefs,

01:33.020 --> 01:36.180
desires, wants, wishes, and a range of complex experiences.

01:36.180 --> 01:41.060
It's not about to sweep that away, but it's trying to explain what might be going on underneath

01:41.060 --> 01:42.220
to give rise to that.

01:42.220 --> 01:44.900
And why does it appear to be the way it does?

01:44.900 --> 01:46.900
That's worth doing.

01:46.900 --> 01:51.580
Neuroscience, of course, is the favorite label of people who want to point out some

01:51.580 --> 01:57.420
of the absurdities that appear in the press every now and then, sometimes from the mouths

01:57.420 --> 02:01.420
of neuroscientists, sometimes from the mouths of journalists reporting neuroscience.

02:01.420 --> 02:03.860
So we hear about everything.

02:03.860 --> 02:07.620
And we hear on neuroscientists have shown us, we know free will, neuroscientists have shown

02:07.620 --> 02:13.900
us that beauty is actually located in a particular part of the cortex.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.060
And when that lights up, that's what it is.

02:16.060 --> 02:18.220
Here's the morality center and so on.

02:18.220 --> 02:25.500
Now I do think one should not be attacking the claims of neuroscience at its weakest

02:25.500 --> 02:27.180
or at its loosest.

02:27.180 --> 02:32.500
As philosophers, we have an obligation to attack a position at its strongest.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.300
So you don't go after a straw man.

02:35.300 --> 02:41.220
What you should do is think of the very best cases that neuroscience offers as a way of

02:41.220 --> 02:45.340
explaining the mind, the self, human understanding.

02:45.340 --> 02:48.660
And if you still find those wanting, now you're doing real work.

02:48.660 --> 02:51.060
Otherwise, it's a waste of time.

02:51.060 --> 02:56.380
If I look at the concept of neuromania, I could put this proposition to you, either

02:56.380 --> 03:03.980
one or the other, not an Aristotelian mean, one or the other, either everything ultimately

03:03.980 --> 03:08.180
can be described in terms of brain processes, your cognitive systems.

03:08.540 --> 03:14.140
I mean, maybe it'll take hundreds of years or a thousand, but ultimately there's neuronal

03:14.140 --> 03:18.340
impulses and synaptic activity and what else is there?

03:18.340 --> 03:19.340
There's the body.

03:19.340 --> 03:20.340
There's the body, e.g.

03:20.340 --> 03:22.900
But that has to be fed back into the system.

03:22.900 --> 03:23.900
That's true.

03:23.900 --> 03:24.900
I mean, you have to have that feedback.

03:24.900 --> 03:25.900
Right.

03:25.900 --> 03:26.900
We have to feedback.

03:26.900 --> 03:29.700
But notice, you're not going to understand an awful lot of the brain activity unless

03:29.700 --> 03:32.740
you correlate it with things going on in the environment.

03:32.740 --> 03:33.740
And changes in the body.

03:33.740 --> 03:35.740
But that has to be coded into neuronal impulses.

03:35.780 --> 03:39.540
Indeed it has, but sometimes we let the world take the strain.

03:39.540 --> 03:43.300
We don't have to have internal representations of everything going on in the world.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.860
That would be too expensive.

03:44.860 --> 03:49.700
We make use of triggers and signals out there in the world that the brain resonates with

03:49.700 --> 03:55.780
or responds to, and we can allow the world to be an external representation for us.

03:55.780 --> 03:59.860
I mean, we've got this concept in philosophy of the extended mind.

03:59.860 --> 04:04.620
When you keep a diary, when you have computer records, when you have your mobile phone,

04:04.620 --> 04:08.740
these are ways in which you've got external memory to keep track of things in the environment.

04:08.740 --> 04:11.980
They're not going on in your brain, but your brain is definitely making use of them.

04:11.980 --> 04:17.140
If we didn't have the brain, these would be meaningless squiggles and symbols.

04:17.140 --> 04:22.620
But it's very obvious that we've got to think of the brain in its location.

04:22.620 --> 04:29.620
Brains are built by genes, and genes are built by creatures in environments, biological

04:29.620 --> 04:34.980
creatures that occupy certain niches that are subject to certain forces.

04:34.980 --> 04:37.140
Now you've got to put the whole thing together.

04:37.140 --> 04:43.140
So I think if neuroscience starts to aggregate the whole of science to itself, as it were

04:43.140 --> 04:45.540
becoming a neo-physics, then that's no good.

04:45.540 --> 04:48.740
But equally, physics doesn't give us the whole explanation of human beings.

04:48.740 --> 04:51.620
It might be that everything in the world is ultimately physical stuff, but there isn't

04:51.620 --> 04:53.860
just one theory of that stuff.

04:53.860 --> 04:57.980
Similarly, there isn't just one theory of what it is we do as human beings.

04:57.980 --> 05:03.900
But boy, neuroscience is very important as a component of the overall theory of mind,

05:03.900 --> 05:07.940
of extended mind, of culture, of language, of all the things that go together to make

05:07.940 --> 05:10.060
us uniquely human.

05:10.060 --> 05:15.340
But when you have extended mind, whatever is in your diary, whatever is in the environment

05:15.340 --> 05:21.420
is ultimately encoded in some signal that is in your brain.

05:21.420 --> 05:24.660
It's responded to, but we don't have perfect encoding.

05:24.660 --> 05:27.820
So for example, let me give you an example of this.

05:27.820 --> 05:34.180
So when the visual system is calculating distance and depth in the environment from

05:34.180 --> 05:38.260
retinal disparity, it's making certain assumptions.

05:38.260 --> 05:42.020
One of the assumptions is that objects are stable under rotation, that they don't change

05:42.020 --> 05:43.220
shape as you move them.

05:43.220 --> 05:47.380
But there's no part of the brain where it's got that assumption written in.

05:47.380 --> 05:54.100
It functions well as long as it's in an environment in which objects are stable under rotation.

05:54.100 --> 05:58.140
If you took that brain to a different environment where they were not, vision wouldn't do the

05:58.140 --> 05:59.140
same job.

05:59.140 --> 06:00.140
It would break down.

06:00.140 --> 06:02.140
That's why you have visual illusions, fun houses at amusing parts.

06:02.140 --> 06:03.140
Exactly so.

06:03.140 --> 06:07.460
But it also shows you why some part of what we are calling the assumptions of the way

06:07.460 --> 06:11.820
things work are distributed jointly between the brain and the environment.

06:11.820 --> 06:13.740
It's a collaboration.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.740
Which is an efficient way to operate.

06:15.740 --> 06:16.740
Absolutely.

06:16.740 --> 06:18.660
Let the world take the strain.

06:18.660 --> 06:22.060
And so what are the implications of that between the two extremes?

06:22.500 --> 06:27.740
Between the two extremes then I think neuromania is attacking a straw man because anybody who

06:27.740 --> 06:31.980
thinks that neuroscience is going to give us the full explanation of the human condition

06:31.980 --> 06:37.380
and our location in the world and our dealing with the environment is over describing their

06:37.380 --> 06:39.180
ambitions and their case.

06:39.180 --> 06:42.300
But therefore we don't need to worry about that.

06:42.300 --> 06:46.100
Neuroscience, together with many other sciences and philosophy, I think are going to make

06:46.100 --> 06:46.980
real progress.
