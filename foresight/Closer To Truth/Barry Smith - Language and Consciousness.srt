1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Barry, what can we learn about consciousness from appreciating language?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So when we have consciousness as moments of experience, we think of these as individual, unique,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and yet we actually want to capture what's the same or different in our experience over time.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So we don't just say, here's a visual experience of red.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We want to say, these are all experiences of the same color red.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So we use categories and classifications.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
In other words, the passing show can get assembled into larger, more meaningful groups

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
when we use language to classify and categorize.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But how do we do that?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How do we connect up these bits of consciousness with something stable,

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
which is classifying the world and not just my own experience

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and which is communicable between you and me?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So that's part of the fascination about how the two combine.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But equally, I think we want to say, look, here's something to notice.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There's something very special that we are the only creatures, the only animals who have language.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is a species-specific property.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And at the same time, we might be the only creatures who not only have minds,

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
but know we have minds and can think about the contents of our own minds.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Now, language, I think, is partly responsible for this way of thinking about the mind, our own, and others,

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
because when I use a sentence, when I say, the euro is in decline,

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
or I hope the euro is not in decline, I might say,

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm using that to both describe a way the world might be,

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
but also to describe the way I see the world.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So notice there's a kind of duality here that we're both describing state of affairs

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and describing a state of mind that is presenting the world as being in that state of affairs.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So I think language has got this ability to capture the contents of the mind

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and talk about them because I can say, Robert thinks the euro is in decline

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and now by embedding that statement, the euro is in decline,

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
which talks about an economy and a state of Europe,

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
it's also being used to talk about a state of Robert's thinking.

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So I think language is one of the ways in which we codify our own experience,

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
our own thinking, get hold of it, and are able to use it to represent our own minds

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and to represent and compare them with the contents of other minds.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So it seems that language then gives us the capacity to transform momentary experiences

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
that we would just see in the moment into general principles that we can relate over time

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
so that we build up categories and meaning from the individual experiences.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's right, and I think the way we learn language is probably because

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
we're coordinating our experience with others by jointly attending to the same thing.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So I mean when you see a parent and a young child and the child's learning language,

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the child's looking at an object, the parent's looking at an object,

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
they're not just happening to look at the same thing,

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
the child goes backwards and forwards from the parent's face to the object,

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
they're jointly attending, and by coordinating their experience,

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
when you introduce a word, it's almost like a sound label for that experience

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
we're both having of that object, a candle, a ball,

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and then taking that word away and reusing it,

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
it can be like a commemoration or a souvenir, a sound souvenir of that experience,

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and using the word can recreate in our minds the original experience.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's very powerful because now we can take that and it's portable

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and use it again and again to draw our attention, our own and others,

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
to the same objects in the world and in fact to objects that are no longer present.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Now that breaks the connection that most animals are bound by

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
to their present experience and environment.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We're able to detach, we're able to think about things that are not present,

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and we're able to compare other parts of our life with now.

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's a very powerful tool.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What about situations where language is impaired?

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Is consciousness impoverished in those cases?

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think it is. I mean cases where you lose the capacity,

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and sometimes very strange cases,

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
a case that was discovered here in London by Elizabeth Scharing,

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
a case that was discovered here in London.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Take a longer pause.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Sometimes it happens in very bizarre ways.

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Take a case that happened here in London,

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
discovered by Elizabeth Warrington and Tim Shallis.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This is a case of a person who had lost all of their words for fruit and vegetables

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and just those words.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So they could talk, they could use language normally,

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
but could not recognize, pronounce or even use words for fruit and vegetables.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's very strange. It's as if a whole shelf of meanings has just been taken away.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And I think that case brought us starkly to terms with the fact

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
that the mind really can be organized a little bit like a modern-day computer,

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
especially where language and meaning is concerned,

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
that there's just this independent way of hooking up to certain classifications.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And if those go missing, there's not much you can do.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So if I'm thinking about this relationship between language and consciousness,

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and I lose some capacity of language, here's my question.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Have I lost a component of consciousness so that I know that I'm me?

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I still have the sense of me, but I've just lost something.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I can't say the names of fruits and vegetables, just like I've lost two fingers.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I know it's me, I haven't changed, I'm just two fingers less.

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Or is there something really degraded about my personal sense?

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Two different kinds of things.

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Two very different kinds of things.

86
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Again, here we're looking at grades of consciousness and grades of language involving consciousness.

87
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Because you can have a way in which you've just lost the word for an object,

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
but you can still recognize the object.

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So here you've got a form of aphasia, I can't use the word,

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
but you can have something much deeper than that,

91
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,000
where you've lost not just the significance of the word as a piece of sound,

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
meaning an object, but you don't recognize the object either.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So you can have visual agnosias where you lose the whole meaning.

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Very obvious cases that sometimes stroke patients can't use the word, glove.

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
They've lost the word glove.

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What is that?

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Can't say.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And it may be just that the word is missing,

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
because if you say, is there a glove on the table?

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes.

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Can you reach for it?

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But other people can say, what is that?

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've no idea.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And you show them a glove and you say, what's this for?

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And they say, I don't know.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Maybe it's for keeping coins in it.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Maybe you put coins of different sizes in these.

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So that shows you, I think, that sometimes using a word like glove,

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
or table, or chair, or glass is actually part of structuring

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and categorizing the world.

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
There's a whole concept that's giving meaningful order

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
to what's appearing in visual consciousness.

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And perhaps the deeper loss of language can actually lead to the lack

115
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
of the very categories that we use to classify our perceptual experience

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
of the environment.

117
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But that still doesn't eliminate my own personal sense of things,

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
my own first-person experience.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It will be degraded in different degrees.

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But it still won't change the absolute quality that I have and awareness.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Now, that's interesting because I think that's controversial

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
and that needs to be investigated.

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Is it that the quality of experience stays just the same,

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
that subjective feel of what's going on in me now,

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and I just can't classify or categorize it?

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Or if we lose the categories, the classification, languages,

127
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
contribution to organizing that consciousness,

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
is the consciousness radically different?

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I suspect it is.
