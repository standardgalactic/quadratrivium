0	6000	Barry, what can we learn about consciousness from appreciating language?
6000	12000	So when we have consciousness as moments of experience, we think of these as individual, unique,
12000	17000	and yet we actually want to capture what's the same or different in our experience over time.
17000	20000	So we don't just say, here's a visual experience of red.
20000	24000	We want to say, these are all experiences of the same color red.
24000	26000	So we use categories and classifications.
26000	32000	In other words, the passing show can get assembled into larger, more meaningful groups
32000	36000	when we use language to classify and categorize.
36000	37000	But how do we do that?
37000	41000	How do we connect up these bits of consciousness with something stable,
41000	45000	which is classifying the world and not just my own experience
45000	48000	and which is communicable between you and me?
48000	53000	So that's part of the fascination about how the two combine.
53000	57000	But equally, I think we want to say, look, here's something to notice.
57000	63000	There's something very special that we are the only creatures, the only animals who have language.
63000	65000	This is a species-specific property.
65000	70000	And at the same time, we might be the only creatures who not only have minds,
70000	74000	but know we have minds and can think about the contents of our own minds.
74000	83000	Now, language, I think, is partly responsible for this way of thinking about the mind, our own, and others,
83000	91000	because when I use a sentence, when I say, the euro is in decline,
91000	94000	or I hope the euro is not in decline, I might say,
94000	99000	I'm using that to both describe a way the world might be,
99000	102000	but also to describe the way I see the world.
102000	108000	So notice there's a kind of duality here that we're both describing state of affairs
108000	114000	and describing a state of mind that is presenting the world as being in that state of affairs.
114000	121000	So I think language has got this ability to capture the contents of the mind
121000	127000	and talk about them because I can say, Robert thinks the euro is in decline
127000	131000	and now by embedding that statement, the euro is in decline,
131000	134000	which talks about an economy and a state of Europe,
134000	138000	it's also being used to talk about a state of Robert's thinking.
138000	144000	So I think language is one of the ways in which we codify our own experience,
144000	151000	our own thinking, get hold of it, and are able to use it to represent our own minds
151000	155000	and to represent and compare them with the contents of other minds.
155000	164000	So it seems that language then gives us the capacity to transform momentary experiences
164000	171000	that we would just see in the moment into general principles that we can relate over time
171000	176000	so that we build up categories and meaning from the individual experiences.
176000	180000	That's right, and I think the way we learn language is probably because
181000	187000	we're coordinating our experience with others by jointly attending to the same thing.
187000	193000	So I mean when you see a parent and a young child and the child's learning language,
193000	197000	the child's looking at an object, the parent's looking at an object,
197000	200000	they're not just happening to look at the same thing,
200000	204000	the child goes backwards and forwards from the parent's face to the object,
204000	208000	they're jointly attending, and by coordinating their experience,
208000	213000	when you introduce a word, it's almost like a sound label for that experience
213000	217000	we're both having of that object, a candle, a ball,
217000	222000	and then taking that word away and reusing it,
222000	227000	it can be like a commemoration or a souvenir, a sound souvenir of that experience,
227000	231000	and using the word can recreate in our minds the original experience.
231000	235000	That's very powerful because now we can take that and it's portable
235000	239000	and use it again and again to draw our attention, our own and others,
239000	243000	to the same objects in the world and in fact to objects that are no longer present.
243000	248000	Now that breaks the connection that most animals are bound by
248000	251000	to their present experience and environment.
251000	255000	We're able to detach, we're able to think about things that are not present,
255000	259000	and we're able to compare other parts of our life with now.
259000	261000	That's a very powerful tool.
262000	265000	What about situations where language is impaired?
265000	268000	Is consciousness impoverished in those cases?
268000	272000	I think it is. I mean cases where you lose the capacity,
272000	274000	and sometimes very strange cases,
274000	278000	a case that was discovered here in London by Elizabeth Scharing,
278000	280000	a case that was discovered here in London.
280000	282000	Take a longer pause.
282000	284000	Sometimes it happens in very bizarre ways.
284000	287000	Take a case that happened here in London,
287000	291000	discovered by Elizabeth Warrington and Tim Shallis.
291000	296000	This is a case of a person who had lost all of their words for fruit and vegetables
296000	298000	and just those words.
298000	301000	So they could talk, they could use language normally,
301000	306000	but could not recognize, pronounce or even use words for fruit and vegetables.
306000	311000	That's very strange. It's as if a whole shelf of meanings has just been taken away.
311000	316000	And I think that case brought us starkly to terms with the fact
316000	321000	that the mind really can be organized a little bit like a modern-day computer,
321000	323000	especially where language and meaning is concerned,
323000	330000	that there's just this independent way of hooking up to certain classifications.
330000	333000	And if those go missing, there's not much you can do.
333000	338000	So if I'm thinking about this relationship between language and consciousness,
338000	343000	and I lose some capacity of language, here's my question.
344000	350000	Have I lost a component of consciousness so that I know that I'm me?
350000	352000	I still have the sense of me, but I've just lost something.
352000	356000	I can't say the names of fruits and vegetables, just like I've lost two fingers.
356000	360000	I know it's me, I haven't changed, I'm just two fingers less.
360000	364000	Or is there something really degraded about my personal sense?
364000	366000	Two different kinds of things.
366000	368000	Two very different kinds of things.
368000	376000	Again, here we're looking at grades of consciousness and grades of language involving consciousness.
376000	380000	Because you can have a way in which you've just lost the word for an object,
380000	382000	but you can still recognize the object.
382000	386000	So here you've got a form of aphasia, I can't use the word,
386000	388000	but you can have something much deeper than that,
388000	394000	where you've lost not just the significance of the word as a piece of sound,
394000	397000	meaning an object, but you don't recognize the object either.
397000	401000	So you can have visual agnosias where you lose the whole meaning.
401000	406000	Very obvious cases that sometimes stroke patients can't use the word, glove.
406000	407000	They've lost the word glove.
407000	408000	What is that?
408000	409000	Can't say.
409000	411000	And it may be just that the word is missing,
411000	413000	because if you say, is there a glove on the table?
413000	414000	Yes.
414000	415000	Can you reach for it?
415000	416000	Yes.
416000	419000	But other people can say, what is that?
419000	420000	I've no idea.
420000	423000	And you show them a glove and you say, what's this for?
423000	424000	And they say, I don't know.
424000	426000	Maybe it's for keeping coins in it.
426000	429000	Maybe you put coins of different sizes in these.
429000	433000	So that shows you, I think, that sometimes using a word like glove,
433000	438000	or table, or chair, or glass is actually part of structuring
438000	440000	and categorizing the world.
440000	443000	There's a whole concept that's giving meaningful order
443000	446000	to what's appearing in visual consciousness.
446000	450000	And perhaps the deeper loss of language can actually lead to the lack
450000	454000	of the very categories that we use to classify our perceptual experience
454000	456000	of the environment.
456000	461000	But that still doesn't eliminate my own personal sense of things,
461000	464000	my own first-person experience.
464000	468000	It will be degraded in different degrees.
468000	474000	But it still won't change the absolute quality that I have and awareness.
474000	478000	Now, that's interesting because I think that's controversial
478000	480000	and that needs to be investigated.
480000	484000	Is it that the quality of experience stays just the same,
484000	488000	that subjective feel of what's going on in me now,
488000	490000	and I just can't classify or categorize it?
490000	494000	Or if we lose the categories, the classification, languages,
494000	497000	contribution to organizing that consciousness,
497000	499000	is the consciousness radically different?
499000	501000	I suspect it is.
