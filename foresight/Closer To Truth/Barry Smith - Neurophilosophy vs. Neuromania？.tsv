0	7240	Barry, in discussions between philosophers and neuroscientists there's this great debate
7240	11840	and what I like to do sometimes is to look at the extremes.
11840	19580	And one extreme which has been called neurophilosophy is that everything in philosophy ultimately
19580	22560	has to be understood in terms of the brain.
22560	23560	There's nothing else.
23560	25860	Everything else just doesn't exist.
25860	31500	On the other hand, the term has been called neuromania, which is that thinking that everything
31500	42380	in terms of the brain is also a fallacy and that it is the irrigation of brain scientists
42380	46820	to think they can explain everything by the physical activities of the brain.
46820	48940	So how do we compare these two extremes?
48940	50460	Can we learn anything from that?
50460	54100	Well, we should be Goudaist Italians and think it's the doctrine of the mean that's
54100	55700	going to be somewhere in the middle.
55700	58460	Now, neurophilosophy, I don't like the term.
58460	62420	I think there's neuroscience and philosophy collaborating with one another.
62420	64380	The philosophers should still be philosophers.
64380	68180	That's how they can contribute to the job of the neuroscientists to help understand the
68180	70900	foundations and the fundamentals of the work.
70900	73420	Equally the neuroscientists should not be amateur philosophers.
73420	75940	So I don't like, I like them collaborating.
75940	78500	I don't like them fusing and merging.
78500	81460	So I do think there's a danger.
81460	86180	Similarly, I think neuroscience is at its worst when it tries to be ultra reductionist.
86180	89060	In fact, some of the best neuroscience today is not reductionist.
89060	93020	Cognitive neuroscience takes very seriously the fact that we're creatures with beliefs,
93020	96180	desires, wants, wishes, and a range of complex experiences.
96180	101060	It's not about to sweep that away, but it's trying to explain what might be going on underneath
101060	102220	to give rise to that.
102220	104900	And why does it appear to be the way it does?
104900	106900	That's worth doing.
106900	111580	Neuroscience, of course, is the favorite label of people who want to point out some
111580	117420	of the absurdities that appear in the press every now and then, sometimes from the mouths
117420	121420	of neuroscientists, sometimes from the mouths of journalists reporting neuroscience.
121420	123860	So we hear about everything.
123860	127620	And we hear on neuroscientists have shown us, we know free will, neuroscientists have shown
127620	133900	us that beauty is actually located in a particular part of the cortex.
133900	136060	And when that lights up, that's what it is.
136060	138220	Here's the morality center and so on.
138220	145500	Now I do think one should not be attacking the claims of neuroscience at its weakest
145500	147180	or at its loosest.
147180	152500	As philosophers, we have an obligation to attack a position at its strongest.
152500	155300	So you don't go after a straw man.
155300	161220	What you should do is think of the very best cases that neuroscience offers as a way of
161220	165340	explaining the mind, the self, human understanding.
165340	168660	And if you still find those wanting, now you're doing real work.
168660	171060	Otherwise, it's a waste of time.
171060	176380	If I look at the concept of neuromania, I could put this proposition to you, either
176380	183980	one or the other, not an Aristotelian mean, one or the other, either everything ultimately
183980	188180	can be described in terms of brain processes, your cognitive systems.
188540	194140	I mean, maybe it'll take hundreds of years or a thousand, but ultimately there's neuronal
194140	198340	impulses and synaptic activity and what else is there?
198340	199340	There's the body.
199340	200340	There's the body, e.g.
200340	202900	But that has to be fed back into the system.
202900	203900	That's true.
203900	204900	I mean, you have to have that feedback.
204900	205900	Right.
205900	206900	We have to feedback.
206900	209700	But notice, you're not going to understand an awful lot of the brain activity unless
209700	212740	you correlate it with things going on in the environment.
212740	213740	And changes in the body.
213740	215740	But that has to be coded into neuronal impulses.
215780	219540	Indeed it has, but sometimes we let the world take the strain.
219540	223300	We don't have to have internal representations of everything going on in the world.
223300	224860	That would be too expensive.
224860	229700	We make use of triggers and signals out there in the world that the brain resonates with
229700	235780	or responds to, and we can allow the world to be an external representation for us.
235780	239860	I mean, we've got this concept in philosophy of the extended mind.
239860	244620	When you keep a diary, when you have computer records, when you have your mobile phone,
244620	248740	these are ways in which you've got external memory to keep track of things in the environment.
248740	251980	They're not going on in your brain, but your brain is definitely making use of them.
251980	257140	If we didn't have the brain, these would be meaningless squiggles and symbols.
257140	262620	But it's very obvious that we've got to think of the brain in its location.
262620	269620	Brains are built by genes, and genes are built by creatures in environments, biological
269620	274980	creatures that occupy certain niches that are subject to certain forces.
274980	277140	Now you've got to put the whole thing together.
277140	283140	So I think if neuroscience starts to aggregate the whole of science to itself, as it were
283140	285540	becoming a neo-physics, then that's no good.
285540	288740	But equally, physics doesn't give us the whole explanation of human beings.
288740	291620	It might be that everything in the world is ultimately physical stuff, but there isn't
291620	293860	just one theory of that stuff.
293860	297980	Similarly, there isn't just one theory of what it is we do as human beings.
297980	303900	But boy, neuroscience is very important as a component of the overall theory of mind,
303900	307940	of extended mind, of culture, of language, of all the things that go together to make
307940	310060	us uniquely human.
310060	315340	But when you have extended mind, whatever is in your diary, whatever is in the environment
315340	321420	is ultimately encoded in some signal that is in your brain.
321420	324660	It's responded to, but we don't have perfect encoding.
324660	327820	So for example, let me give you an example of this.
327820	334180	So when the visual system is calculating distance and depth in the environment from
334180	338260	retinal disparity, it's making certain assumptions.
338260	342020	One of the assumptions is that objects are stable under rotation, that they don't change
342020	343220	shape as you move them.
343220	347380	But there's no part of the brain where it's got that assumption written in.
347380	354100	It functions well as long as it's in an environment in which objects are stable under rotation.
354100	358140	If you took that brain to a different environment where they were not, vision wouldn't do the
358140	359140	same job.
359140	360140	It would break down.
360140	362140	That's why you have visual illusions, fun houses at amusing parts.
362140	363140	Exactly so.
363140	367460	But it also shows you why some part of what we are calling the assumptions of the way
367460	371820	things work are distributed jointly between the brain and the environment.
371820	373740	It's a collaboration.
373740	375740	Which is an efficient way to operate.
375740	376740	Absolutely.
376740	378660	Let the world take the strain.
378660	382060	And so what are the implications of that between the two extremes?
382500	387740	Between the two extremes then I think neuromania is attacking a straw man because anybody who
387740	391980	thinks that neuroscience is going to give us the full explanation of the human condition
391980	397380	and our location in the world and our dealing with the environment is over describing their
397380	399180	ambitions and their case.
399180	402300	But therefore we don't need to worry about that.
402300	406100	Neuroscience, together with many other sciences and philosophy, I think are going to make
406100	406980	real progress.
