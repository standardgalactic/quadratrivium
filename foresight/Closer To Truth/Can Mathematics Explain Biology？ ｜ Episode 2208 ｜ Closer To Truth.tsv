0	29000	Is life fundamental in the cosmos?
29000	39000	By this I mean, is life an inevitable outcome of the development of our universe baked in from the beginning?
39000	50000	One need not believe in God or in anything supernatural to give credence to the big speculative idea that life in our universe is no accident,
50000	55000	that life somehow must emerge from the deep structure of the cosmos.
55000	61000	How to address this big question?
61000	71000	One way is to examine the deep structure of the cosmos and to do so via mathematics, which is the foundation of physics.
71000	74000	Here's the question that follows.
74000	78000	Is mathematics also the foundation of biology?
78000	82000	Can mathematics explain biology?
82000	95000	I'm Robert Lawrence Kuhn and Closer to Truth is my journey to find out.
95000	100000	How to explore the relationship between mathematics and biology?
100000	107000	First, mathematics can describe biology with simplifying models that approximate reality.
107000	109000	So, how does this work?
109000	117000	Second, can mathematics also constitute the biological mechanisms that are reality?
117000	120000	I start with state-of-the-art research.
120000	126000	I meet a pioneer who develops mathematical models to assess physiological disorders.
126000	130000	What do these models say about the mathematics of biology?
130000	136000	The author of, from clocks to chaos, the rhythms of life, Leon Glass.
137000	144000	Leon, I'd like to understand how mathematics can help elucidate the rhythms of life.
144000	150000	So, one of the ways that the mathematics has interacted with the subject matter
150000	155000	is to develop mathematical models of the various systems of the body,
155000	160000	the various rhythms of the body in nerve cells or in heart cells,
160000	164000	the various ionic currents that are going into and out of cells.
164000	167000	All of these are described experimentally.
167000	170000	You can measure the velocity of a conduction of a nerve cell.
170000	172000	You can measure the period of the heart.
172000	176000	But you can also try to study the underlying mechanisms
176000	183000	and develop equations that one can use to model and to reproduce the behaviors.
183000	191000	So, one of the ways in which this has been important is in terms of making the experiments better.
191000	195000	In our own work, one of the problems that we're very interested in
195000	199000	is predicting the risk of sudden cardiac death.
199000	206000	One of the factors that plays a role is instabilities in the heart
206000	212000	that may be observable and may be understood prior to the cardiac arrest.
212000	216000	It has been documented, mostly in early work,
216000	221000	that abnormal beats called premature ventricular complexes
221000	225000	have increased the risk for sudden death.
225000	230000	When we look at electrocardiograms, when we look at records of heartbeats
230000	237000	over people over many hours and people particularly who have these abnormal heartbeats,
237000	243000	we see extremely unusual patterns of activity which are almost like fingerprints,
243000	249000	we call them heart prints, in which individual people can be distinguished one from the other.
249000	256000	Well, we believe that some of these dynamic patterns may be significant
256000	261000	in terms of increasing or predicting the increased risk of heart death.
261000	264000	And what type of mathematics do you use for the analysis?
264000	268000	So, most of the analysis at the moment is just statistics.
268000	274000	If we try to do models, then the models are using either different equations
274000	280000	or nonlinear differential equations to try to model the details of those dynamics.
280000	286000	But we have found it very hard to model the details in individual people.
286000	291000	This is frustrating because it's the sort of thing that we ought to be able to do.
291000	298000	So, one of the problems in this area is that the real-world events in any person are comparatively rare.
298000	306000	So, it's necessary to develop big databases over long periods of time.
306000	310000	And I might say that one of the ways mathematics is being used now
310000	320000	is in terms of development of large databases to try to make sense of what's happening in individual patients.
320000	323000	So, one of the ways in which things will go forward in the future
323000	331000	is developing increasingly personalized models for understanding what's happening in individual people
331000	334000	and also predicting what will happen.
334000	340000	Leon's work exemplifies two kinds or uses of mathematics in biology.
340000	344000	First, statistical analysis of large data sets.
344000	351000	And second, model-making to improve experimental design and enable individual predictivity.
351000	357000	For example, that cardiac arrhythmias may be dynamical diseases offers new treatment protocols.
357000	361000	Clearly, math and biology are related.
361000	365000	I'm not surprised, but it's the scope and kind of relationship that count.
365000	370000	The more pervasive and powerful math is in explicating biology,
370000	374000	the more fundamental math may be in driving biology.
374000	379000	So, can math also explicate other areas of biology?
379000	385000	Take biological reproduction, such as the spread of infectious diseases.
385000	390000	I meet the scientists who initiated the field of virus dynamics,
390000	394000	which led to a quantitative understanding of HIV infection,
394000	400000	professor of biology and mathematics at Harvard, Martin Nowak.
400000	405000	So, mathematics can be used to describe populations of cells and viruses.
405000	409000	Viruses infect cells and infected cells produce more viruses.
409000	412000	This is what I call the basic model of virus dynamics.
412000	415000	And that's a very simple mathematical equation.
415000	421000	And that's an equation you can actually use to really address a very important biomedical problem.
421000	424000	And that was something that we did in 1995.
424000	428000	For example, HIV and HIV treatments already became available.
428000	434000	And you gave a single drug to a patient, and the patient developed resistance within four weeks.
434000	437000	Why was that evolution of resistance so fast?
437000	442000	Some viruses infect cells and then they sit there, they do nothing for a very long time.
442000	448000	So, we were actually able to analyze data at that time using the basic model of virus dynamics.
448000	453000	Data, how the virus abundance in the patient declines in response to treatment.
453000	457000	So, you have somehow an equilibrium of virus abundance in that patient.
457000	463000	Then you hit the virus with treatment, and then you observe how the virus responds to that treatment.
463000	468000	And from that response rate, you can prove, actually, using the basic model of virus dynamics,
468000	473000	that generation time of the virus in those patients is approximately one day.
473000	481000	In other words, 99% of the virus particles that you find in the blood of patients came from cells that were infected only yesterday.
481000	483000	Wow, wow.
484000	488000	And that you can show, mathematically, with the model of virus dynamics, you get this interpretation.
488000	491000	And then you know that's the turnover rate of the virus.
491000	493000	Then you can calculate its evolutionary potential.
493000	498000	And then you're not surprised that it gets complete resistance against the single drug in four weeks.
498000	503000	And that was a very strong argument to move the field to combination treatment.
503000	511000	So, when you now hit the virus with three drugs at the same time, chances are that the virus does not come up with resistance
511000	516000	because the resistant mutant to all three drugs is not present in the virus population at the time you start treatment.
516000	519000	And now I'm arguing the same for cancer treatment.
519000	521000	In some sense, it is always like this.
521000	527000	You give a treatment, the resistant mutant is already present at the time you start treatment.
527000	530000	This is how the biological population kind of works.
530000	532000	The mutants are just sitting there, they're not doing anything.
532000	537000	But once you give treatment, you hit the sensitive cells, but the resistant ones start to grow.
537000	544000	So we proved also for cancer that against single treatment, it is a mathematical necessity
544000	548000	that the resistant mutant cells will be present at the time you start treatment.
548000	552000	And therefore, you have to use at least two drugs at the same time.
552000	559000	You have to force the cancer to make two mutational steps, each one with a probability of 10 to the minus 9,
559000	561000	because that would not be present.
561000	567000	So 10 to the minus 9, if you only have one of them, if you have a large number of cancer cells, it'll happen.
567000	572000	But 10 to the minus 18th will not happen.
572000	577000	What kind of equations describe this?
577000	584000	Branching processes, for example, so these are particular stochastic processes in probability theory
584000	591000	where a cell can either die or it can reproduce or it can produce a mutant, and that's what we follow over time.
591000	594000	And do you have to do simulation runs?
594000	598000	We can do computer simulations, but we always want to prove mathematically.
598000	606000	And what are the fundamental implications of this for cancer?
606000	615000	I think that you get a precise quantitative mathematical understanding of how to...
615000	622000	A startling medical breakthrough, the cocktail of drugs to treat HIV and stop AIDS,
622000	627000	transforming a death sentence into a chronic condition that can be managed.
627000	632000	And key to developing the treatment is the mathematics of viral dynamics,
632000	637000	biological secrets encoded in the language of mathematics,
637000	644000	more clues to math's deep presence in the foundations of life, more evidence is needed.
644000	647000	What else in biology can math explain?
647000	654000	Can simple mathematical rules govern diverse biological phenomena?
654000	660000	I go to the Santa Fe Institute, the world leader in complexity research,
660000	669000	much of it based on biology, to meet a pioneer in universal scaling laws, physicist Jeffrey West.
669000	678000	It's mathematics which expresses the underlying generic constraints of networks,
678000	686000	and they are concepts like the idea of space filling, which is that this network has to go everywhere.
686000	689000	Every cell has to be fed, so you have to put that into a mathematical framework.
689000	691000	You have to mathematicalize that.
691000	699000	You have to also mathematicalize optimization, the fact that the surgery system that we all share,
699000	706000	we in this instance, meaning every single mammal that has ever existed,
706000	714000	we all share the same fractal-like self-similar network which is optimizing
714000	719000	in terms of the amount of energy that is being dissipated in the system.
719000	724000	So you have to put that into mathematics, and there are well-known techniques for doing this,
724000	731000	in the guise of field theory and Euler Lagrange equations,
731000	734000	which is in a certain sense, mathematicizing life.
734000	741000	And it is from that, putting these concepts into mathematics and solving the equations
741000	748000	that shows, for one thing, that the optimal configuration of the network
748000	751000	is that it is like a fractal, that it is self-similar.
751000	757000	It sort of repeats itself with generic rules within the network itself.
757000	764000	So the way growth works in this framework is that, first of all,
764000	766000	you have to have the idea that you have to supply energy.
766000	771000	So you eat, you metabolize the energy, and then you have to send it through the networks.
771000	775000	So that's where the mathematics comes in, the constraints of the networks.
775000	779000	It then gets delivered to the cells, so you have mathematics there.
779000	787000	And at the cellular level, that metabolic energy is allocated between
787000	795000	repair, maintenance, replacing cells that have died and so on, and new growth.
795000	800000	And so one has to write down the mathematics of that with the network constraining it.
800000	807000	And if you do that, what comes out is something very satisfying,
807000	816000	and that is that you show that the growth curve, that is how the size of the organism changes with time.
816000	820000	And what you find is something that's called sigmoidal growth.
820000	823000	You start quickly, and then you stop.
823000	832000	And what is beautiful about the theory is that it explains naturally why you stop growing.
832000	839000	And that stopping of growth is intimately related to the fact that metabolic rate,
839000	847000	the supply of energy is scaling with an exponent which is less than one with an economy of scale,
847000	854000	so that the bigger you are, less energy is being delivered to cells as you grow.
854000	858000	On the other hand, the number of cells is increasing linearly.
858000	864000	And if you increase linearly, and you're only being supplied with something that's less than linear,
864000	867000	eventually you stop.
867000	874000	And that's how you stop. And use that, you can calculate the complete growth curve of any organism.
874000	879000	And you can use the same mathematics and come up with approximately the size of the optimization of each organism.
879000	880000	Yes.
880000	882000	So that's really remarkable.
882000	893000	So it's very lovely. And in fact, even more beautiful, I think, is that the theory then tells you how to rescale the size and age of every organism
893000	898000	so that it appears that every organism is growing at the same rate.
898000	903000	Everything reduces to a single curve on which we all sit.
903000	908000	So it's the great unity of life.
908000	910000	Here's what's remarkable.
910000	915000	Mathematical models not only can account for specific biological phenomena,
915000	925000	but can also unify diverse biological phenomena across radically different life forms.
925000	927000	Mathematizing life.
927000	931000	The beauty of mathematics engendering the beauty of biology?
931000	933000	Not quite.
933000	940000	Because everything I've heard so far is about the descriptive power of mathematics and biology.
940000	948000	Can math go further? Can math discern deeper laws generating or regulating life?
948000	952000	I ask a theoretical physicist who's creative, sometimes startling ideas,
952000	958000	challenge current belief in biology as well as in physics, Paul Davies.
958000	965000	What I see as being a useful application of mathematics in biology is in reconstructing the tree of life.
965000	973000	And so if you pick a particular one of your genes, chances are it'll be identical in me,
973000	977000	but if we look at a chimpanzee, we'll find the same gene, but there'll be a few variations
977000	981000	and a pig, even more variations, a geranium, even more.
981000	987000	And so by looking at the genetic distances, the deviations, how great they are between organisms,
987000	991000	you can go back and construct a tree and infer something about the sequence,
991000	994000	genetic sequence in the common origin.
994000	996000	And that's been very useful.
996000	1003000	It is a way of approaching the theory of evolution in a more mathematical way.
1003000	1009000	But it's really a form of curve fitting, I think. It's not a law.
1009000	1015000	There's no way, for example, that we could predict now, if we came back in another 10 million years,
1015000	1021000	that some new type of organism, which hadn't existed on Earth before, would have come into existence.
1021000	1022000	There's too much contingency.
1022000	1029000	You've been trying to search for new laws of physics to explain biology.
1029000	1033000	If that quest turns out to be fruitful, which is very much uncertain,
1033000	1036000	do you see that being described in mathematical terms?
1036000	1043000	Oh, very definitely. So I have in mind, with the new type of physics that I think operates in living systems,
1043000	1047000	that there will be equations to write down that would describe it.
1047000	1054000	I have a hunch that it might have something to do with the transition between the quantum world and the classical world.
1054000	1064000	And so this is, I'm about to make a very heretical statement, that when we talk about evolution in the context of quantum physics,
1064000	1067000	what we mean then is not biological evolution.
1067000	1071000	We mean how does the wave function change over time? How does it evolve?
1071000	1076000	And there is a particular mathematical way. It's called unitary evolution.
1076000	1081000	It's a bit like something being time-symmetric or reversible.
1081000	1085000	So long as you don't make a measurement, that's how wave functions evolve.
1085000	1089000	If you make a measurement, they evolve in a very different way, sometimes called the collapse of the wave function.
1089000	1093000	Some people don't believe it really happens, but that's a different story.
1093000	1102000	So I think there will be an additional term in the Schrodinger's equation for the evolution of the wave function,
1102000	1106000	representing the type of biology that I'm talking about.
1106000	1111000	This will be a term that would be negligible at the level of atoms and small molecules,
1111000	1116000	but would become more and more significant at the level of large molecules.
1116000	1120000	And this would be a non-unitary evolution of the wave function.
1120000	1125000	So this idea of the wave function collapses, I think there will be this additional term
1125000	1130000	which will bring the classical world into being at about the same transition
1130000	1135000	as to where we would start using biology language, language of signals and information
1135000	1142000	and translation and transcription and all those sorts of things biologists love,
1142000	1146000	and the realm of atoms and molecules of physicists love.
1146000	1151000	You would not be upset if I classified that idea as some place between radical and bizarre?
1151000	1158000	Yes, I myself would describe this as more than radical, because it is a step, it's a big step,
1158000	1161000	and I've resisted that step for most of my career.
1161000	1170000	I've somehow thought that in my emergent view of the world that the only real laws of the laws
1170000	1174000	would take place at the bottom level of physics,
1174000	1181000	because I think we're never going to resolve this dispute between emergence and reductionism.
1181000	1184000	We just go on talking in philosophical terms forever and ever,
1184000	1190000	and as somebody boldly says, look, there are actual genuine physical effects that could be measured
1190000	1194000	where, to put it very bluntly, that if you're a complete reductionist,
1194000	1201000	an atom that would have done that does that as a result of these additional effects.
1201000	1203000	And you can define that mathematically, you think?
1203000	1208000	I believe that we can define it mathematically, I have some ideas about how to do it,
1208000	1214000	but unless you can explore it experimentally, then these are just words.
1214000	1221000	Paul offers fearless radical science, new physics with new mathematics needed for life,
1221000	1225000	an additional term in the Schrödinger equation in quantum mechanics
1225000	1229000	needed for evolving the wave form in biology, yikes!
1229000	1234000	As most scientists, Paul's conjecture will not score well.
1234000	1238000	Ask me, well, I'm intrigued.
1238000	1242000	I'd follow Paul along this trail, take a chance.
1242000	1246000	I might like or hope there is something special about biology,
1246000	1250000	not reducible to standard model physics.
1250000	1256000	But what I might like or hope should not determine what I should think.
1256000	1263000	I now look to the future, wonder what's in store for the mathematics of biology.
1263000	1268000	I seek a visionary with depth in mathematics and breadth in biology.
1268000	1273000	I go to the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton to meet its director, at the time,
1273000	1277000	theoretical physicist Robert Dycraft.
1277000	1282000	I think in terms of the mathematics in biology, we're still waiting for the big breakthrough.
1282000	1287000	I think physics, before Newton and others, it was also struggling.
1287000	1291000	In fact, Newton had to think of the concept of a derivative,
1291000	1295000	an infinitesimal change, very strange concept,
1295000	1299000	and had to invent calculus as the natural language for physics,
1299000	1301000	and then it turned out to be very successful.
1301000	1304000	We have seen other things in quantum mechanics.
1304000	1308000	We had to think of abstract algebra and non-commutative objects
1308000	1311000	or Einstein's in terms of curved spaces.
1311000	1316000	If you see time and time and again when science meets a new field,
1316000	1321000	a field of great complexity with lots of data and structures,
1321000	1325000	then ideally new mathematical concepts emerge.
1325000	1329000	So I think the life sciences will be a great gift to mathematics
1329000	1331000	because it's a completely different world.
1331000	1335000	It has a different language. What we are looking for are new ideas,
1335000	1340000	and I think actually that in some sense the deep ideas from computer science,
1340000	1343000	the way you think in terms of algorithms,
1343000	1346000	where you have instructions that reproduce itself,
1346000	1351000	that's an element that's much closer to the nature of life.
1351000	1355000	I think we see time and time again our examples where you have massive data sets
1355000	1360000	and inside these huge spaces of hundreds of millions of dimensions,
1360000	1363000	and there are structures that you are guiding towards,
1363000	1365000	and that's what we see with life.
1365000	1368000	It has this massive amount of complexity,
1368000	1372000	but it's channeled through somehow fixed pathways.
1372000	1376000	And I think that is something where we're still lacking the mathematical language.
1376000	1381000	So the amount of data that's currently being gathered in the life science,
1381000	1384000	I think it almost doubles every six months.
1384000	1388000	I think that actually is something where new kind of mathematics could emerge.
1388000	1392000	What I find so exciting is that I would see this tremendous transition
1392000	1394000	that we're going through in science now,
1394000	1398000	that we found the building blocks, the building blocks of matter,
1398000	1400000	and also the building blocks of life,
1400000	1403000	and now the question is what can we build out of that?
1403000	1407000	So talking about infinite universes of possibilities,
1407000	1412000	and somehow life is finding its way through that infinity,
1412000	1416000	what are somehow the calculations that life is making
1416000	1421000	when it builds a protein, when it builds a cell, when it builds an organism?
1421000	1428000	It's such an efficient computer that I think this kind of information processing point of view
1428000	1430000	will be extremely promising.
1430000	1434000	And I feel in some sense, no, scientists are becoming designers or artists.
1434000	1437000	If an artist, he put a pen on paper,
1437000	1442000	then immediately you have a shape that has never been made before.
1442000	1447000	And so what are the ways that guide you in finding interesting shapes?
1447000	1451000	As a modern life scientist, as a quantum material scientist,
1451000	1456000	as an information scientist producing artificial intelligence,
1456000	1459000	all of us become essentially artists,
1459000	1462000	trying to find our ways in this vast space of possibilities.
1465000	1470000	This vast space of possibilities, what a wonderful way to portray life.
1470000	1475000	What an open invitation for mathematics to engage with biology.
1475000	1480000	Mathematics, of course, is increasingly engaged with biology.
1480000	1485000	Statistics are certainly essential for analyzing population data.
1485000	1489000	Mathematical models certainly improve experimental design
1489000	1492000	and enable individual predictivity.
1492000	1497000	The deep question is whether mathematics engagement with biology goes beyond
1497000	1501000	sharper statistics, closer models, better experiments.
1501000	1507000	The deep question is whether the mathematics of biology goes to fundamental realities.
1507000	1509000	Start with this.
1509000	1513000	Mathematical models reveal remarkable common principles
1513000	1517000	that unify biological phenomena across radically diverse life forms.
1517000	1519000	Then this.
1519000	1526000	Could biology, as a wholly different world, be a great gift to mathematics?
1526000	1533000	I cannot dismiss the big speculative idea that life in our universe is no accident,
1533000	1535000	that life is fundamental,
1535000	1541000	and that radically novel mathematics might exist at the level of life
1541000	1543000	and exist nowhere else.
1543000	1548000	Could biology be fundamental, something like physics?
1548000	1553000	I cannot go all the way with Paul Davies,
1553000	1561000	although I am tempted and I do hope Paul is closer to truth.
