1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
The language is a core part of human cognition. It's language that constructs thoughts.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,760
That's where thoughts come from.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,080
Welcome to Closer to Truth Chats. Today I'm speaking with Noam Chomsky, the distinguished

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,080
theoretical linguist, analytic philosopher, and cognitive scientist who is one of the most cited

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,320
living scholars. Closer to Truth is presenting this four-part mini-series with Professor Chomsky.

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,320
Part three focuses on the implications of Chomsky's linguistic theories, especially universal

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:48,160
grammar, for human sentient cognition, evolution, and uniqueness. Noam, let's start with how a

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,320
universal grammar affects the understanding of human development. You've talked about how a

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,040
baby learns language and the importance of a universal grammar.

10
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:07,600
First of all, let's turn to some things that are now pretty well established by experiment.

11
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:18,880
There have by now been careful statistical studies of the data available to a young child,

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,240
two or three-year-old child, mainly by Charles Yang, a cognitive scientist at the University

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:34,160
of Pennsylvania. Careful analysis, he's shown that it's extremely sparse. There are a lot of words,

14
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,240
but the same words keep repairing over and over. There's a phenomenon, there's a descriptive

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:50,800
phenomenon known as Zipp's law, which shows about the rank frequency distribution of words in a text.

16
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:59,760
Turns out that some words like the A appear many, many times. As you get to other words,

17
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:07,120
they appear fewer times. Most words appear maybe once in a long text. Well, that means the actual

18
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:15,120
data available to a child may be many occurrences of words, but very few words, very few

19
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:24,560
bigrams, pairs of repeated words, and so on. So the data is very sparse. Studies of language

20
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:34,880
acquisition, the most exciting of them by Lila Gleitman, a friend and colleague who

21
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,560
passed away a couple of weeks ago, great scientist, her work and other work demonstrated

22
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:52,480
that children have very impressive linguistic knowledge at a point where they can't exhibit it.

23
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:02,240
So some of her early work back in the 60s had to do with what's called telegraphic speech.

24
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:11,200
There's a period in language development. A young child will only use what sounds like

25
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,560
the way telegraphic speech works, only substantive words like want, cookie, let's say, something like

26
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:27,760
that. That's speech. So it turns out, I won't go through the experiment, but it turns out that

27
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:36,480
at that age, the child doesn't understand telegraphic speech. It only understands normal speech,

28
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,080
meaning that in its mind, it already has the whole complex system. It's just not producing it.

29
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:53,360
Turns out that the meanings of words, complex words, are learned with almost maybe one or two

30
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,640
presentations. Somehow it's all in the mind and just comes out when it's triggered.

31
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,160
Things like, take say, again, structure dependence, the principle that I mentioned,

32
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:15,520
the fact that all operations in all languages depend, keep only to the abstract structure

33
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:22,880
that the mind creates and ignores the all of the evidence that is presented, linear order.

34
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:31,520
So from the earliest testable age on through life, we ignore 100% of what we hear

35
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,720
and use only abstract structures that our mind creates. Actually, no way for this to be learned.

36
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:47,280
It's inconceivable, literally inconceivable. And that means it's just built in. We now have an

37
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,880
understanding of why that actually comes from, is forced by the simplest computational operation.

38
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:03,600
If you go back to what I said about evolution, some disruptive change takes place. Mother nature

39
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,440
figures out the simplest way of reconstructing the system, accommodating that disruption.

40
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,480
That seems to be what happened with language. Soon as the disruption took place,

41
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:25,120
the system was created in the simplest possible terms that yields automatically such things as

42
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:34,240
structural, structure preservation, the other kinds of phenomena I've been describing.

43
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,800
It must also be the explanation for the meanings of words, but there it's mysterious. We don't know

44
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,400
how just whether it happened, but don't know how. Well, what does that tell us about human cognition?

45
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,240
Tells us that probably a very substantial language is a core part of human cognition.

46
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,200
It's language that constructs thoughts. That's where thoughts come from,

47
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:12,080
any kind of thought that we can comprehend at least is simply basically language. It's what

48
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,640
language produces. So that's a core part of our nature. That's what distinguishes us from other

49
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:27,520
species, thought and language. And these core parts of our nature seem to be quite substantially

50
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:39,600
simply built into our nature, shared by all humans, developing through triggering by environmental

51
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,960
stimuli can lead to what look to very different outcomes. But as soon as we look more deeply,

52
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:55,600
we find that these are surfaced variations based on fundamental similarities. Well, I think that

53
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:03,360
tells us a good bit about one of the few parts of human cognitive capacity that we know anything

54
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:12,640
about about the Jerry Fodor great philosopher cognitive scientist that once joked that cognitive

55
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:19,920
science is the study of vision and language. It's not far from the truth. Language is one

56
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:27,840
part of it. Vision is another big part of it. Vision works the same way. It turns out that

57
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:36,480
by now it's understood that very limited stimulation is necessary if an infant,

58
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:44,480
we don't experiment with infants, but humans have the same visual system as other mammals. So with

59
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:53,680
other mammals, cats, monkeys, you can show that if you don't present patterned stimulation

60
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:01,440
in the early days of life, the visual system won't function. It has to be set off by the word

61
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:10,080
kinds of stimulation. And if you modify the kinds of stimulation, say horizontal lines instead of

62
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,720
vertical lines, it'll affect the way the visual system develops. That's pretty much like language.

63
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:25,280
It's not the first weeks of life. It's the first year or two of life. The basic system is set one

64
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:34,560
or another way. And then it just grows out of the nature endowed us with true the visual system.

65
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:44,640
It's true of ambulatory system, the way you walk and so on. It's true of language. It seems to be

66
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,640
just the way organisms, it's true of other organisms that we know of. So that seems to be

67
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,840
the pretty much the way organisms develop. There are plenty of differences. So we have a

68
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:08,240
different culture than, say, the Bantu who separated from other humans over 100,000 years ago.

69
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,400
Different culture, but basically the same. If you take an infant from that culture and

70
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:24,400
raise it in Boston, it'll go to Harvard and become a quantum physicist. Conversely,

71
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,280
it doesn't seem to be any detectable cognitive difference. So there are a lot of things we

72
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:38,320
learned from this. In the 60, 65, going on 70 years since you've developed the ideas,

73
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,720
particularly the universal grammar, neuroscience in particular, which was my original field,

74
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:54,320
has mushroomed with ability to do functional NMRs, all different kinds of scanning devices,

75
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:02,000
plasticity in neuroscience. So as you have seen the development of neuroscience over these decades,

76
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:13,760
how do some of the structural concepts relate to the abstract ideas of hierarchical structural

77
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:21,680
building in the language system? Because your ideas with these kind of cognitive concepts,

78
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:33,280
which has to be instantiated in brain tissue. So how has neuroscience affected or confirmed or

79
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:43,040
questioned the cognitive ideas that you've had? Well, first of all, let's recognize that the brain

80
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,320
sciences are a very difficult field. First of all, because of the complexity of the brain,

81
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:57,760
but also for ethical reasons, you cannot do the experiments that come to mind.

82
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:08,080
You can't do invasive experiments with humans. We know a lot about vision, but that's through

83
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:14,880
invasive experiments with other animals, which have pretty much the same visual system.

84
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,560
You can't do that with language, because there's no other organism that is any remotely like a

85
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:28,880
language system. This is unique to humans. So comparative work is out. Direct invasive work

86
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:37,680
is out. That means the kinds of research you can do are very restricted. So what you're talking

87
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:46,480
about, which is real, sophisticated, significant, is basically imaging studies where you try to

88
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,680
look at things like rate of blood flow and one or another part of the brain to see what's happening.

89
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:04,320
You cannot stick an electrode into the language areas of the brain and see what a particular

90
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,040
neuron is doing. You can't, in principle, maybe if you're mangola, you can do it,

91
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:20,960
but ethical considerations block it. You can't raise a child in a controlled environment to see

92
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:27,360
what would happen. If you could do that, you could learn a lot about development, but it's

93
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:34,480
ruled out. So the first point is experimentation is extremely limited, both by complexity,

94
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:42,400
but simply for ethical reasons. Still, things have been learned, and there are some interesting

95
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:49,440
results. The most interesting result I know of actually has to do with structured dependence,

96
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:59,120
the thing I mentioned, the fact that the rules of language don't pay any attention to what we hear

97
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:07,760
in linear order, but only to abstract structures that the mind constructs. There's experimental work

98
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:18,320
on this, very interesting. It's done under the design of Andrea Moro, Italian linguist,

99
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,440
whose friend of ours, very good linguist. He designed experiments which were carried out

100
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:35,760
by an advanced neuroscience group at Milan in Italy, where the design of the experiment is

101
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:47,120
basically this. You have monolingual subjects, maybe speakers of German, and you develop

102
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:54,960
invented languages, not real languages, invented ones with kind of like Jabberwocky,

103
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:03,200
you know, words that don't exist, and have two different kinds of inventive languages.

104
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:09,920
One of them modeled on a language they don't know, maybe Japanese.

105
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:23,680
The other, using simple computational operations on linear order. So what will be interpreted

106
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:32,560
as negation takes the third word in a sentence and makes that the negative particle, very simple

107
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:42,400
computation. Okay, so give the subjects these two kinds of materials. What he found is that when

108
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:52,160
you give them materials based on an existing language, the areas of the brain that are involved

109
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,280
in language processing are all lighting up, they're working. When you give them the ones using

110
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:07,040
simple computations like linear order, you get diffuse brain activity, meaning it's been

111
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:15,440
being treated as a puzzle, not language. There's actually supporting psycholinguistic evidence.

112
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:24,320
Neil Smith, a British linguist, fine, British linguist, also a friend, had been working for

113
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:34,160
many years with a subject who he named Chris. It's a person who has extremely limited cognitive

114
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:42,160
abilities, almost nothing, but fantastic linguistic capacities. We put a grammar book in front of him

115
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,960
of some language you never heard of, pretty soon he knows the whole language, you know.

116
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,960
He did pretty much the same experiments with Chris. Chris could do nothing with the puzzles,

117
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:03,360
nothing, just blank stare with the system modeled on an actual language, he just treated it like

118
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:11,680
any other language. Well, all of this strongly suggests something, that there are brain areas

119
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,200
specifically attuned to language, and they will pick out the structures

120
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:27,040
and force us to operate the way I've described. We have plenty of other cognitive capacities,

121
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:34,160
we can solve lots of puzzles, but they seem to be dissociated from language. Now this fits

122
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:41,680
with a lot of work that's been done from another direction. Eric Leneberg mentioned earlier,

123
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:49,840
friend of mine in college, one of the three students who were disagreeing with everything

124
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:57,280
when we were grad students at Harvard in the early 50s. He went on to found modern biology of language,

125
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:05,600
and among the topics that he studied were what are called dissociations, people who have a

126
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:13,520
high capacity in one area of cognition, but very little in some other area. So he began to study

127
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:22,240
subjects with good language capacity, but poor cognitive capacities and conversely,

128
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:30,000
similar work. Now that's been extended significantly since one of the main people is

129
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:38,880
Susan Curtis, cognitive scientist at San Diego University in California, has done extensive

130
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:48,560
work on dissociations, and it has pretty much the same results. You find cognitive

131
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:57,040
dissociations in both directions of many kinds. It looks as though language capacity

132
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:07,040
is dissociated from other cognitive capacities. That's one of the reasons why very popular efforts

133
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:13,440
to try to show that language developed out of general cognition, that one reason why they always

134
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:21,680
fail, these are just different capacities. So there is a neuroscience, and this is one example,

135
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:31,680
the best example I know of neuroscientific support for fundamental principles that emerge in

136
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,880
the study of language itself and psychology of language. There are other things about

137
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:46,400
hierarchical structure and so on, but it's very difficult to establish because the kinds of work

138
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,680
you'd like to do, you just can't do. What can a universal grammar tell us about the evolution

139
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,120
of language? Your book with Robert Berwick, Why Only Us, Language and Evolution, really a

140
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:05,440
superb book, deals with the questions. One of the issues that you have is the origin to

141
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,320
understand the evolution of language. You have to understand what is language, and the common idea

142
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,680
that communication is the function of language, you say, derives from the mistaken belief that

143
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:25,040
language somehow is an evolution of animal communication. You have this radical distinction

144
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,840
between human language and systems of animal communication. First of all, we should notice

145
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,720
that the common phrase that you repeated, communication is the function of language.

146
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:46,080
It's totally meaningless. Organic systems don't have a function or they have many functions.

147
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:57,120
So what's the function of the spine? Is it to help us stand up? Is it to accumulate calcium?

148
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:06,800
Is it to develop white blood cells? Is it as a casing for a nerve? Actually, it's all of those

149
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:18,320
things. Let's go back to evolution again. First, a disruption takes place, a mutation, symbiosis,

150
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,440
some other thing, many things. Then comes the reconstruction stage. Nature

151
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,600
tries to make the best of whatever happened. If it was a mutation, try to organize the new system

152
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:41,600
in the best possible way. Then comes the winnowing stage, where among the things that have been

153
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,640
created, the more adaptable ones survive natural selection. But at the second stage,

154
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,440
nature hasn't the slightest idea what the functions are going to be. It doesn't care about them.

155
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,760
It's just finding the best design based on what's around. Now that often leads to highly

156
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:10,320
dysfunctional systems, because it may be that the best thing is not well designed for

157
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,680
functions we'd like it to carry out. So for example, during this last year,

158
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:27,840
I've discovered that ears are highly dysfunctional for wearing masks when you have glasses and a

159
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,640
hearing aid. It's a horrible pain in the neck. Nature made a terrible mistake and should have had

160
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:42,560
different kind of ears. Well, same's true of the spine. And any engineer could engineer a better

161
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:48,400
system than the spine. But the way it developed over time, this is the best that could be done.

162
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:55,120
So talk about communication being the function of language is, first of all, meaningful.

163
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:03,280
Okay, because language is developed, it's used for many functions. For thinking, for reflection,

164
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:12,080
for many kinds of actions, among them is communication. But the idea that's hidden behind

165
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:18,400
it is what you said, that language somehow evolved from animal communication systems.

166
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:27,680
The evidence is overwhelming that that's not the case. Take even just what I've just suggested,

167
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:34,640
discuss the brief things I've discussed, like structure dependence. There's nothing remotely

168
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:44,400
like it in any animal system. And take the meanings of words, the meaning of river, house, tree,

169
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:52,320
anything. Nothing remotely like it in animal communication. In fact, in animal symbolic

170
00:22:52,320 --> 00:23:00,080
systems, the symbols actually do have associations with non-linguistic entities.

171
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:09,840
So if you look at the cries of a monkey, various cries of say, a verbate monkey, there'll be

172
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:19,360
a cry that is made when leaves start moving in a certain way in a tree and all the other monkeys

173
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:26,800
run away. We interpret that as a warning signal. What the monkey's doing, we don't know. But it's

174
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,320
interpreted as a warning signal. Maybe there's an eagle up there, the monkey's run away.

175
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:43,760
A hormonal change can lead to a call that basically means I'm hungry. Again, what's

176
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:52,160
going on in the animal's mind, we don't know. But all animal communication systems, the symbols seem

177
00:23:52,160 --> 00:24:02,800
to be one-one associated with extra-mental entities, say that a physicist could detect.

178
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,840
Human language has nothing like that, totally different. The structural principles, the rules

179
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:17,040
of combination, not even the remotest analog in other organisms. So what are the implications of

180
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:24,720
that for human uniqueness? You point out in the book that the primate brain in great apes or chimpanzees

181
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,080
looks like it has a language readiness, but obviously, as you say, there is no language there.

182
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,840
So what are the implications for human uniqueness? It means it's just like every other system.

183
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:44,960
Visions say there's visual readiness, which is built into mammalian visual systems.

184
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:51,840
It's readiness. It doesn't show up unless it's stimulated. You don't trigger it,

185
00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:01,600
it degenerates. The way you stimulate it depends on how it develops. These are classic results in

186
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:10,080
study of vision. Language is the same. How did it develop? Well, we talk about this in the book

187
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:18,080
you mentioned. Not too much is known, but there are some suggestions about, mainly based on work of

188
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:30,400
German Neuroscientist Dr. Friedrichi has had some good ideas about how the brain,

189
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:39,040
small changes in the brain, might have provided the principle of what's called recursive generation,

190
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,560
the principle that allows us to create an infinite number of structures,

191
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:52,320
basically thoughts from a finite number of symbols. It's called recursive generation.

192
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,720
Sure, work shows how certain small changes in the brain might have led to that.

193
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,880
Well, that would give us recursive generation. Nature takes over, does it in the simplest possible

194
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:16,240
way, connects it somehow to our conceptual systems. You have language. In fact, many different languages

195
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:26,320
depending on how it's externalized in sound, or mostly in sound sign, looks pretty much like

196
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:33,040
that's what pretty much happened. Now, this is almost nobody in the field of evolution of language

197
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:42,560
believes this. Everybody believes it must have been by a slow, small process of natural selection.

198
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:50,320
But in my view, as I've said, I think that's simply based on a misunderstanding

199
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:59,200
of the theory of evolution, one concepts that were held 40 or 50 years ago, but have long been

200
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:07,680
abandoned, and a failure to bother to look at the nature of language. If you want to study the

201
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:16,720
evolution of any system, whatever it is, E. coli, anything, you first have to identify

202
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,320
the phenotype. You have to say, what's the nature of the system that I'm interested in?

203
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,640
You don't do that. You can't look at its evolution by definition. Well,

204
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:37,200
much of the field doesn't look at the phenotype and is distorted by a misunderstanding of the

205
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:47,760
theory of evolution. But if we extricate ourselves from these flaws, I think a relatively clear

206
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:54,080
picture emerges of what might have happened with plenty of gaps to fill.

207
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,040
Norm, I want to ask you about consciousness. Consciousness is a core part of closer to truth,

208
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:05,200
and we examine it from all aspects, the neuroscience sure, but a limited materialism,

209
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,360
but consciousness doesn't even exist. Neuroscience mechanisms, we deal with panpsychism, even to

210
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,320
idealism. What could the language and particularly your understanding of language and human uniqueness

211
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,640
contribute to the fierce debate in philosophy of mind about the deep nature of consciousness,

212
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:32,960
if anything? I should say, first of all, that I'm not overly impressed by this ferocious debate,

213
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,680
but we could talk about that. Actually, I think the basic answer to the debate was given

214
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:47,520
by Bertrand Russell about a century ago. I've talked about it. Within philosophy,

215
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,960
it's been developed particularly by Galen Strawson, a very good young philosopher.

216
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,440
I think he's put it very clearly, basically Russell's point. He said,

217
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,760
there's essentially no problem of consciousness. We know what consciousness is. That's the thing

218
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,640
we know most about. That's all of our lives. It's consciousness. We know more about that than

219
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:21,520
anything. I can tell you exactly what I'm conscious of right now in great detail, Russell's point.

220
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:31,440
What we don't know is what matter is. That's what's obscure. In fact, I've written extensively

221
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,360
about this, but it's a long story, but there has been no concept of matter since Newton.

222
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:46,240
Newton demolished the concept of matter that was the basis of modern science. It was called

223
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,360
the mechanical philosophy. The idea that the world is a very elaborate machine,

224
00:29:52,400 --> 00:30:04,320
Galileo, Leibniz, Huygens, Newton, all, Descartes, all adopted this. Newton demonstrated that it's

225
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:11,840
not true. John Locke immediately, within a couple of years, understood the consequences

226
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:22,160
and concluded that it follows that thinking must be a property of organized matter, whatever

227
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:29,040
matter turns out to be. What matter turns out to be, we don't know. Science keeps changing,

228
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:35,760
moving, trying to discover what it is. We know what consciousness is. We don't know what matter is.

229
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:43,520
It's whatever the best theory of the world tells us. Then comes the problem of how

230
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:51,680
to relate whatever the best theory of matter is with what consciousness is. Basically Locke's

231
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:59,680
problem. How to think is a property of organized matter. Let's figure out how it works. That's

232
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,320
what we've been discussing. What does language tell us about consciousness? I think it tells

233
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:14,640
us something quite interesting. It tells us that almost all of the mental activity involved in

234
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:22,880
language is inaccessible to consciousness. Everything I've discussed so far is inaccessible

235
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:30,960
to consciousness. You can't introspect and discover that rules follow the principle of

236
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:40,000
structured dependence. You can't introspect and find out why he stole many books. He reads many

237
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,720
books, means of a racist reader, but many books are read by him. It doesn't mean that. You can't

238
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:55,120
introspect and figure out how your mind is creating those two thoughts. That's virtually

239
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,280
every all the use of language. Almost all of our use of language is just internal.

240
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,480
What you and I are now doing, externalization, is a very small part of the use of language.

241
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,040
Mostly we're thinking, we're reflecting. We have the slightest idea what's going on in there. We get

242
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:21,600
little bits of fragments of it now and then reach consciousness. Well, all of that is unconscious.

243
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:29,760
You have to study it pretty much the same way. You study our second nervous system. Humans have

244
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:37,600
two nervous systems. One of them is this one. The other one is this one. It's called the enteric

245
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:46,160
nervous system. Huge, complex nervous system. Huge number of neurons. Almost all the properties

246
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:52,080
of this one, it's what regulates our whole body. We're totally unconscious of it except when we

247
00:32:52,080 --> 00:33:00,400
have a stomach ache and it says something's wrong. It has Alzheimer's. It has Parkinson's.

248
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,840
It's a huge nervous system, but we haven't the slightest awareness of it except occasionally,

249
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,640
stomach ache. It's pretty much the same as true of our main nervous system that's up here.

250
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,440
We don't know what's going on inside it. We can't introspect. We have to study it

251
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:29,520
from the outside, basically. When we can learn about it, we've been talking about some of the

252
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:35,200
ways you can learn about it, but it leaves plenty of mysteries. I think what it tells us about

253
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:43,040
consciousness is that consciousness is a pretty superficial part of human thought and cognition.

254
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,880
Dits and pieces come out from what's going on in there and there's not much more. I should

255
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,760
mention that the history of the study of consciousness is interesting. It's good scholarly work on it.

256
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:06,480
Best work is by Udo Thiel, a good historian and a philosopher. He's pointed out that the study of

257
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:13,680
consciousness in the modern sense is a very modern obsession. There wasn't much talk of

258
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:21,360
consciousness in the history of philosophy until pretty much the 17th century. Then the parts of

259
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:30,800
consciousness that were discussed were consciousness of the inner workings of our mind, not qualia,

260
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:38,960
what it feels like to see the color red. That's a modern thing, pretty much 20th century.

261
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:46,720
It's become a lead topic of philosophy, I think, in mistaken ways. The right way to look at it,

262
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:56,000
I think, is Russell Strossen, the way I've just been talking about. But what language tells us,

263
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,920
I think, is most of what's going on in our mental lives is inaccessible to consciousness.

264
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,320
So there are really two questions here. One is the relationship between what we are conscious of,

265
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,600
versus all the other things going on in our mind that are subconscious. Language is a spectacular

266
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:19,440
example. And of course, the autonomic system we have really no access to, and happily so.

267
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:28,080
The other question, though, is on qualia about why can we, as embodied creatures, have this

268
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,120
scent of inner experience, felt experience? The two questions are separate. Maybe they're related.

269
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,640
I appreciate your response to the first question in terms of relationship between

270
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,840
in language that most things are subconscious, that we have no access to whatsoever.

271
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:54,320
But what are your feelings about qualia? Gail Strossen, who was on Close to the Truth,

272
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:02,320
good friend. We communicate. He has a kind of a panpsychic view of the world, that consciousness

273
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,600
is everywhere. Russell had kind of a monism that I'm not sure I completely understand.

274
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:17,360
What is your deep sense? Why not ask a deeper question about Locke's suggestion? What's the

275
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:27,440
relation between whatever the brain is constituted of and thinking? That's a much more profound

276
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:34,000
question. Well, it's a hard question. Most questions are hard. One question, which is,

277
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,440
in my view, much less profound, is the one that philosophers are obsessed with. What's the

278
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:49,120
basis in organized matter for perceiving the color red? Not for perceiving it. That we understand

279
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:57,680
very well. The theory of how red is perceived is pretty well understood. But what it feels like

280
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,840
to see red? We're probably never going to get an answer to that. I expect to get an answer.

281
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:11,920
So, we know what we feel like. We can't describe it. Can you describe what you feel like when you

282
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:19,840
see red? I can't. I mean, there's a lot of talk about, a lot of work was stimulated by Thomas

283
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:27,120
Nagel's book on what it's like to be a bat. He argued persuasively that we can't really

284
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,160
know what it's like to be a bat. Can we know what it's like to be a human being?

285
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:41,520
Can you say what it's like to be you? I can't say what it's like to be me. I mean, I somehow

286
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,080
experience what it's like to be me, but I can't convey it to you. Maybe somebody can write a poem

287
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:54,240
about it. Or write a novel. You read novels, it's sort of good literature, sort of gives you some

288
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:01,280
insight into it. But do we expect to get a scientific answer to what it's like to see?

289
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:08,000
What it feels like to see the color red? I don't see any reason to believe it.
