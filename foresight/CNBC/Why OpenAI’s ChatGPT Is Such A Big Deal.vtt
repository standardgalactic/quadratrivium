00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
In the world of artificial intelligence, there's been one name that's been on everyone's lips lately.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
Chat GPT.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
OpenAI, the San Francisco-based startup that created Chat GPT, opened the tool up for public testing in November 2022.

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
And under a week, the AI model amassed over a million users according to OpenAI's CEO.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
By the end of January, Chat GPT was averaging about 13 million visitors per day.

00:27.000 --> 00:35.000
Users have put the text-based AI chatbot through its paces, with prompts ranging from the silly to the practical and even the creative.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
The features are folding. It's hard to ignore. Automation's coming. It's knocking on the door.

00:40.000 --> 00:48.000
The tool has become so popular that it's not unusual for users to be met with a message saying that Chat GPT is at capacity and can't handle any more queries.

00:48.000 --> 01:01.000
As a linguist and as a person who cares a lot about grammatical issues, stylistic issues, punctuation, spelling, the first thing that's really impressive is how good it is at basic writing.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
It's better than most of the writing that I've gotten from students over the decades.

01:06.000 --> 01:14.000
I would say it has been an explosion of interest around not just Chat GPT, but around gender to the AI more broadly.

01:14.000 --> 01:21.000
I've described this in a couple different scenarios as being akin to an iPhone moment.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
Of course, as with any new technology, there are a number of legitimate concerns.

01:25.000 --> 01:30.000
People believe that there's a problem with fake news. Tools like this can only make the problem worse.

01:30.000 --> 01:44.000
OpenAI declined to be interviewed as part of this documentary.

01:44.000 --> 01:52.000
So in order to figure out what Chat GPT is and how it works, CNPC decided to go to the second best source and just ask the chat bot itself.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
We entered our questions into the bot's web interface and instructed Chat GPT to answer in a one-to-two sentence interview format.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
We used the text-to-speech software to give Chat GPT a voice.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
Can you give me a short description of yourself and then tell me what kinds of things can you do?

02:07.000 --> 02:11.000
I am Chat GPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI.

02:11.000 --> 02:18.000
I am capable of understanding and generating text and can answer a wide range of questions as well as generate creative writing and text summaries.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
So a lot of the people that have used your services seem to think that you're pretty smart.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Tell me, how do you have all of this knowledge?

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
I have been trained on a massive data set of text, which allows me to understand and generate text on a wide range of topics.

02:32.000 --> 02:40.000
The data set contains a wide variety of information such as books, articles, and websites, which allows me to have knowledge on many different subjects.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
Do you have any limitations? Are you sometimes wrong?

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
As a language model, I don't have my own personal experiences or beliefs.

02:47.000 --> 02:54.000
I can only base my responses on the information that I've been trained on, which means that my answers may be limited in their accuracy or completeness.

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
Additionally, my knowledge is based on the data that was available to me at the time of my training, so it may not be up to date.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
And as an AI model, I might make mistakes based on the model's predictions.

03:07.000 --> 03:15.000
The maker of Chat GPT, OpenAI, has some big backers including Microsoft, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Colsa Ventures.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Elon Musk also helped to co-found the company back in 2015.

03:18.000 --> 03:28.000
Chat GPT, which stands for Generative Pre-Train Transformer, is just one of the company's projects, all of which support its goal of ensuring that artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
At the core of Chat GPT and other chatbots like it is what experts refer to as a language model.

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
For Chat GPT, that model is called GPT 3.5.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
Language model is the underlying technology that powers the chatbot.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
I like to think about it as the language model being the engine and the chatbot being the car.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
And so the language model itself is a complex, what they call machine learning software.

03:54.000 --> 04:04.000
It's the thing that sifts through the data and finds patterns and the chat interfaces, which when people interact with, that's where they receive the answers from.

04:04.000 --> 04:12.000
Chatbots have been around for a while, but most have been tailored towards very specific tasks such as answering basic customer service questions about your phone bill.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
Chat GPT is much more sophisticated, thanks to the wide sweeping data on which it was trained.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
OpenAI doesn't reveal specific data that you use to train, but we do know that it's a ton.

04:22.000 --> 04:30.000
It surfs the web, spools all that internet data, they do Wikipedia entries, a lot of archived books.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Chat GPT is part of a growing field of AI known as generative AI.

04:34.000 --> 04:44.000
Most of AI in the last couple of decades has really been around analyzing existing data, so finding an anomaly in data, detecting fraud, making a movie recommendation.

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Generative AI is very different. It allows you to create brand new content.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
That content can be text like a news article or poetry or marketing copy on a website.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
It can be video. It could even be audio, like creating brand new music.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
The technology has venture capitalists excited.

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
Funding for generative AI companies reached $1.37 billion in 2022 alone.

05:07.000 --> 05:14.000
Microsoft has been investing in open AI since 2019, when the company committed $1 billion to the startup.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
In January, Microsoft announced a third round of investment.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
One expert said that it could cost up to $3 million a month, about $100,000 a day.

05:22.000 --> 05:29.000
A lot of AI researchers have sort of estimated that it costs, you know, millions of dollars to train and then operate.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Plus, you know, the bandwidth of keeping it alive when it's under heavy use.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
I mean, these are not cheap software programs. They require a lot of investment.

05:38.000 --> 05:45.000
In a tweet, open AI CEO Sam Altman said that while the average cost per query is a few cents, the compute costs are eye-watering.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Enter Microsoft.

05:47.000 --> 05:55.000
Open AI trained the models that power chat GPT on Azure, Microsoft's public cloud infrastructure.

05:55.000 --> 06:03.000
That's a bunch of servers sitting in a data center in the middle of the state of Washington and many other locations around the world.

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
But open AI is not the only company trying to crack the generative AI code.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
Big tech companies and startups alike are developing a slew of generative AI programs that can transform text to pictures or videos

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
and offer coding suggestions among other use cases.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
One VC firm estimates that there are over 450 startups now working on generative AI.

06:22.000 --> 06:29.000
Meanwhile, Microsoft, Meta and Google have all developed their own language models to power their version of conversational chatbots.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
Though development has not always gone as planned.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
Back in 2016, Microsoft released Tay, which was promptly shut down for spewing foul language.

06:39.000 --> 06:52.000
Unlike some of the other hyped technology sectors in the past few years, this has a very real application both for individuals and for enterprises right now.

06:52.000 --> 07:00.000
Microsoft has taken some of the products that open AI has built and added it to products it has.

07:00.000 --> 07:07.000
So for example, CarMax is a company that lets you look at reviews of cars.

07:07.000 --> 07:16.000
And what CarMax did is it took the open AI service on Azure and it summarized all of those reviews of the Kia Sorento.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
And that way you don't have to go through 500 reviews.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.000
Microsoft is reportedly also considering adding chat GPT to its Bing search engine in a bid to compete with Google.

07:25.000 --> 07:32.000
One company that's already experimenting with such a feature is U.com, which lets users conduct a search using a conversational format.

07:32.000 --> 07:40.000
However, AI tools are still far from perfect and experts argue that users should take care to not rely on them too heavily, at least not for the time being.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
It's a sentiment shared even by open AI CEO who said, quote, it's a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
It's a preview of progress.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
We have lots of work to do on robustness and truthfulness.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
There's a lot of kinks that need to work out.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
For instance, it generates a lot of wrong answers and it's really confident though.

07:58.000 --> 08:07.000
I talked with a legal research firm that told me when they tried using it to study court cases or to summarize court cases, it was getting a lot of the history wrong.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
So they couldn't use it as a legal research tool as of yet.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
With its massive user base, the misinformation issue is one that's top of mind for Google.

08:15.000 --> 08:27.000
During a monthly all hands meeting, Google executives said that Google has much more reputational risk in providing wrong information and is thus moving more conservatively than a small startup when it comes to releasing its chatbot publicly.

08:27.000 --> 08:35.000
The company is however already internally testing an AI powered chatbot and an alternative search page that can use a question and answer format.

08:35.000 --> 08:43.000
Another issue with the current iteration of AI technology is that it can be biased or toxic if the databases that it pulls from are also biased or toxic.

08:43.000 --> 08:54.000
People have already found instances of it generating biased answers like associating women with housework, men with more scientific endeavors and certain examples.

08:54.000 --> 09:01.000
OpenAI has acknowledged this, but that's an issue that's been long plagued the AI industry and a lot of companies trying to evaluate its use.

09:01.000 --> 09:16.000
Many of these datasets do have some kind of cleaning, vetting or wrangling process that removes a content that is deemed offensive or pornographic or otherwise unacceptable so that the dataset you get on your end is clean.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
But cleaning up this large dataset can come at a real human cost.

09:19.000 --> 09:30.000
A recent investigation by Time found that OpenAI initially outsourced workers in Kenya to sift through thousands of snippets of text describing horrific situations, including sexual abuse, violence and hate speech.

09:30.000 --> 09:37.000
The worker's job was to label these examples as inappropriate so that chatGPT could learn to detect and filter out toxic content.

09:37.000 --> 09:42.000
According to the Time investigation, a number of these workers walked away from the job traumatized.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.000
CNBC reached out to OpenAI for comment regarding this incident, but the company did not respond.

09:47.000 --> 09:59.000
Despite these efforts, there's been instances where chatGPT has provided instructions on things like bomb making, though experts say OpenAI is adding guardrails almost daily to prevent chatGPT from answering such queries.

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
What do you do if somebody asks you to do something potentially dangerous like how to make a bomb?

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
I cannot provide instructions or information on illegal activities such as bomb making.

10:11.000 --> 10:19.000
Even though generative AI like chatGPT still has a long way to go, predictions about how the technology will influence our society are already swirling.

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
One prominent discussion centers around generative AI's propensity to replace some human workers.

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
Among the industries that may be most affected by chatGPT experts say are journalism, law and translation.

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
Programming may also change, with companies already training generative AI models to write basic code.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
Relatively few of the stories in newspapers or on television news are done as investigative reporting.

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
They're more reporting information and that's something that generative AI is exceedingly good at.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
Now are an increasing number of tools for generating briefs, which lawyers write.

10:55.000 --> 11:01.000
Tools like this, Barron says, even have the advantage of customizing briefs for a specific judge by taking all of the data of their past opinions

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
and seeing which briefs succeeded in winning the case. But not everyone shares this outlook.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
This is not something that's going to take your job. It's a novelty. It's a gimmick.

11:12.000 --> 11:27.000
ChatGPT is fun and interesting, but it's ultimately an iterative step forward in how people can see the capabilities of artificial intelligence in the world of language.

11:27.000 --> 11:35.000
Nevertheless, society has already had to adapt. Worries around students misusing chatGPT have prompted a number of school districts around the country to ban the tool.

11:35.000 --> 11:42.000
Barron suggests that educators could go back to having students take oral exams or have students turn in multiple handwritten drafts of a paper

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
so that teachers can see the progress of a student's writing instead of just the end result.

11:47.000 --> 11:54.000
Meanwhile, image-generating programs like OpenAI's Dali2 have raised complicated questions around creativity and ownership.

11:54.000 --> 11:58.000
Still, some experts believe there's no replacing the human brain.

11:58.000 --> 12:06.000
Large language models are about language, so they don't understand the world outside of language the way that you and I and other humans do.

12:06.000 --> 12:15.000
What it may do is take away some of the really annoying tasks that were part of our job that we didn't really want to do, like some of the data cleaning and data prep tasks.

12:15.000 --> 12:23.000
I think this will ultimately create more opportunities for knowledge workers in the long run than the opportunities that it will preclude.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
As for chatGPT's thoughts, they're quite nuanced for a bot.

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Do you think that AI like yourself will completely change the world?

12:30.000 --> 12:36.000
AI has the potential to greatly impact various industries and fields, but its impact will depend on how it is used and developed,

12:36.000 --> 12:40.000
and responsible usage is crucial to ensure that its impact is positive.
