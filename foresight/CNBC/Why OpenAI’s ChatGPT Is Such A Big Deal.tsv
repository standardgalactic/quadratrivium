0	6000	In the world of artificial intelligence, there's been one name that's been on everyone's lips lately.
6000	10000	Chat GPT.
10000	17000	OpenAI, the San Francisco-based startup that created Chat GPT, opened the tool up for public testing in November 2022.
17000	22000	And under a week, the AI model amassed over a million users according to OpenAI's CEO.
22000	27000	By the end of January, Chat GPT was averaging about 13 million visitors per day.
27000	35000	Users have put the text-based AI chatbot through its paces, with prompts ranging from the silly to the practical and even the creative.
35000	40000	The features are folding. It's hard to ignore. Automation's coming. It's knocking on the door.
40000	48000	The tool has become so popular that it's not unusual for users to be met with a message saying that Chat GPT is at capacity and can't handle any more queries.
48000	61000	As a linguist and as a person who cares a lot about grammatical issues, stylistic issues, punctuation, spelling, the first thing that's really impressive is how good it is at basic writing.
61000	66000	It's better than most of the writing that I've gotten from students over the decades.
66000	74000	I would say it has been an explosion of interest around not just Chat GPT, but around gender to the AI more broadly.
74000	81000	I've described this in a couple different scenarios as being akin to an iPhone moment.
81000	85000	Of course, as with any new technology, there are a number of legitimate concerns.
85000	90000	People believe that there's a problem with fake news. Tools like this can only make the problem worse.
90000	104000	OpenAI declined to be interviewed as part of this documentary.
104000	112000	So in order to figure out what Chat GPT is and how it works, CNPC decided to go to the second best source and just ask the chat bot itself.
112000	119000	We entered our questions into the bot's web interface and instructed Chat GPT to answer in a one-to-two sentence interview format.
119000	122000	We used the text-to-speech software to give Chat GPT a voice.
122000	127000	Can you give me a short description of yourself and then tell me what kinds of things can you do?
127000	131000	I am Chat GPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI.
131000	138000	I am capable of understanding and generating text and can answer a wide range of questions as well as generate creative writing and text summaries.
138000	143000	So a lot of the people that have used your services seem to think that you're pretty smart.
143000	146000	Tell me, how do you have all of this knowledge?
146000	152000	I have been trained on a massive data set of text, which allows me to understand and generate text on a wide range of topics.
152000	160000	The data set contains a wide variety of information such as books, articles, and websites, which allows me to have knowledge on many different subjects.
160000	163000	Do you have any limitations? Are you sometimes wrong?
163000	167000	As a language model, I don't have my own personal experiences or beliefs.
167000	174000	I can only base my responses on the information that I've been trained on, which means that my answers may be limited in their accuracy or completeness.
174000	179000	Additionally, my knowledge is based on the data that was available to me at the time of my training, so it may not be up to date.
179000	183000	And as an AI model, I might make mistakes based on the model's predictions.
187000	195000	The maker of Chat GPT, OpenAI, has some big backers including Microsoft, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Colsa Ventures.
195000	198000	Elon Musk also helped to co-found the company back in 2015.
198000	208000	Chat GPT, which stands for Generative Pre-Train Transformer, is just one of the company's projects, all of which support its goal of ensuring that artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.
208000	213000	At the core of Chat GPT and other chatbots like it is what experts refer to as a language model.
213000	217000	For Chat GPT, that model is called GPT 3.5.
217000	221000	Language model is the underlying technology that powers the chatbot.
222000	228000	I like to think about it as the language model being the engine and the chatbot being the car.
228000	234000	And so the language model itself is a complex, what they call machine learning software.
234000	244000	It's the thing that sifts through the data and finds patterns and the chat interfaces, which when people interact with, that's where they receive the answers from.
244000	252000	Chatbots have been around for a while, but most have been tailored towards very specific tasks such as answering basic customer service questions about your phone bill.
252000	257000	Chat GPT is much more sophisticated, thanks to the wide sweeping data on which it was trained.
257000	262000	OpenAI doesn't reveal specific data that you use to train, but we do know that it's a ton.
262000	270000	It surfs the web, spools all that internet data, they do Wikipedia entries, a lot of archived books.
270000	274000	Chat GPT is part of a growing field of AI known as generative AI.
274000	284000	Most of AI in the last couple of decades has really been around analyzing existing data, so finding an anomaly in data, detecting fraud, making a movie recommendation.
284000	288000	Generative AI is very different. It allows you to create brand new content.
288000	295000	That content can be text like a news article or poetry or marketing copy on a website.
295000	299000	It can be video. It could even be audio, like creating brand new music.
299000	301000	The technology has venture capitalists excited.
301000	307000	Funding for generative AI companies reached $1.37 billion in 2022 alone.
307000	314000	Microsoft has been investing in open AI since 2019, when the company committed $1 billion to the startup.
314000	317000	In January, Microsoft announced a third round of investment.
317000	322000	One expert said that it could cost up to $3 million a month, about $100,000 a day.
322000	329000	A lot of AI researchers have sort of estimated that it costs, you know, millions of dollars to train and then operate.
329000	333000	Plus, you know, the bandwidth of keeping it alive when it's under heavy use.
333000	338000	I mean, these are not cheap software programs. They require a lot of investment.
338000	345000	In a tweet, open AI CEO Sam Altman said that while the average cost per query is a few cents, the compute costs are eye-watering.
345000	347000	Enter Microsoft.
347000	355000	Open AI trained the models that power chat GPT on Azure, Microsoft's public cloud infrastructure.
355000	363000	That's a bunch of servers sitting in a data center in the middle of the state of Washington and many other locations around the world.
363000	368000	But open AI is not the only company trying to crack the generative AI code.
368000	374000	Big tech companies and startups alike are developing a slew of generative AI programs that can transform text to pictures or videos
374000	377000	and offer coding suggestions among other use cases.
377000	382000	One VC firm estimates that there are over 450 startups now working on generative AI.
382000	389000	Meanwhile, Microsoft, Meta and Google have all developed their own language models to power their version of conversational chatbots.
389000	392000	Though development has not always gone as planned.
392000	398000	Back in 2016, Microsoft released Tay, which was promptly shut down for spewing foul language.
399000	412000	Unlike some of the other hyped technology sectors in the past few years, this has a very real application both for individuals and for enterprises right now.
412000	420000	Microsoft has taken some of the products that open AI has built and added it to products it has.
420000	427000	So for example, CarMax is a company that lets you look at reviews of cars.
427000	436000	And what CarMax did is it took the open AI service on Azure and it summarized all of those reviews of the Kia Sorento.
436000	439000	And that way you don't have to go through 500 reviews.
439000	445000	Microsoft is reportedly also considering adding chat GPT to its Bing search engine in a bid to compete with Google.
445000	452000	One company that's already experimenting with such a feature is U.com, which lets users conduct a search using a conversational format.
452000	460000	However, AI tools are still far from perfect and experts argue that users should take care to not rely on them too heavily, at least not for the time being.
460000	466000	It's a sentiment shared even by open AI CEO who said, quote, it's a mistake to be relying on it for anything important right now.
466000	468000	It's a preview of progress.
468000	471000	We have lots of work to do on robustness and truthfulness.
471000	473000	There's a lot of kinks that need to work out.
473000	478000	For instance, it generates a lot of wrong answers and it's really confident though.
478000	487000	I talked with a legal research firm that told me when they tried using it to study court cases or to summarize court cases, it was getting a lot of the history wrong.
487000	490000	So they couldn't use it as a legal research tool as of yet.
490000	495000	With its massive user base, the misinformation issue is one that's top of mind for Google.
495000	507000	During a monthly all hands meeting, Google executives said that Google has much more reputational risk in providing wrong information and is thus moving more conservatively than a small startup when it comes to releasing its chatbot publicly.
507000	515000	The company is however already internally testing an AI powered chatbot and an alternative search page that can use a question and answer format.
515000	523000	Another issue with the current iteration of AI technology is that it can be biased or toxic if the databases that it pulls from are also biased or toxic.
523000	534000	People have already found instances of it generating biased answers like associating women with housework, men with more scientific endeavors and certain examples.
534000	541000	OpenAI has acknowledged this, but that's an issue that's been long plagued the AI industry and a lot of companies trying to evaluate its use.
541000	556000	Many of these datasets do have some kind of cleaning, vetting or wrangling process that removes a content that is deemed offensive or pornographic or otherwise unacceptable so that the dataset you get on your end is clean.
556000	559000	But cleaning up this large dataset can come at a real human cost.
559000	570000	A recent investigation by Time found that OpenAI initially outsourced workers in Kenya to sift through thousands of snippets of text describing horrific situations, including sexual abuse, violence and hate speech.
570000	577000	The worker's job was to label these examples as inappropriate so that chatGPT could learn to detect and filter out toxic content.
577000	582000	According to the Time investigation, a number of these workers walked away from the job traumatized.
582000	587000	CNBC reached out to OpenAI for comment regarding this incident, but the company did not respond.
587000	599000	Despite these efforts, there's been instances where chatGPT has provided instructions on things like bomb making, though experts say OpenAI is adding guardrails almost daily to prevent chatGPT from answering such queries.
599000	604000	What do you do if somebody asks you to do something potentially dangerous like how to make a bomb?
604000	608000	I cannot provide instructions or information on illegal activities such as bomb making.
611000	619000	Even though generative AI like chatGPT still has a long way to go, predictions about how the technology will influence our society are already swirling.
619000	624000	One prominent discussion centers around generative AI's propensity to replace some human workers.
624000	630000	Among the industries that may be most affected by chatGPT experts say are journalism, law and translation.
630000	636000	Programming may also change, with companies already training generative AI models to write basic code.
636000	643000	Relatively few of the stories in newspapers or on television news are done as investigative reporting.
643000	649000	They're more reporting information and that's something that generative AI is exceedingly good at.
649000	655000	Now are an increasing number of tools for generating briefs, which lawyers write.
655000	661000	Tools like this, Barron says, even have the advantage of customizing briefs for a specific judge by taking all of the data of their past opinions
661000	666000	and seeing which briefs succeeded in winning the case. But not everyone shares this outlook.
666000	672000	This is not something that's going to take your job. It's a novelty. It's a gimmick.
672000	687000	ChatGPT is fun and interesting, but it's ultimately an iterative step forward in how people can see the capabilities of artificial intelligence in the world of language.
687000	695000	Nevertheless, society has already had to adapt. Worries around students misusing chatGPT have prompted a number of school districts around the country to ban the tool.
695000	702000	Barron suggests that educators could go back to having students take oral exams or have students turn in multiple handwritten drafts of a paper
702000	707000	so that teachers can see the progress of a student's writing instead of just the end result.
707000	714000	Meanwhile, image-generating programs like OpenAI's Dali2 have raised complicated questions around creativity and ownership.
714000	718000	Still, some experts believe there's no replacing the human brain.
718000	726000	Large language models are about language, so they don't understand the world outside of language the way that you and I and other humans do.
726000	735000	What it may do is take away some of the really annoying tasks that were part of our job that we didn't really want to do, like some of the data cleaning and data prep tasks.
735000	743000	I think this will ultimately create more opportunities for knowledge workers in the long run than the opportunities that it will preclude.
743000	747000	As for chatGPT's thoughts, they're quite nuanced for a bot.
747000	750000	Do you think that AI like yourself will completely change the world?
750000	756000	AI has the potential to greatly impact various industries and fields, but its impact will depend on how it is used and developed,
756000	760000	and responsible usage is crucial to ensure that its impact is positive.
