Checking CNBC/Why OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT Is Such A Big Deal.txt
1. **Reputational Risk**: Google is being cautious with releasing its AI-powered chatbot publicly due to the reputational risk associated with providing incorrect information. This caution reflects the company's understanding of the significant impact misinformation can have.
   
2. **Internal Testing**: Google is internally testing an AI chatbot and a search page that uses a question and answer format, aiming to provide more conversational interactions.

3. **Bias and Dataset Cleaning**: AI technology, including chatGPT, has shown biases in responses due to the datasets it was trained on. Companies like OpenAI are aware of this issue and are working to mitigate it. However, efforts to clean these datasets can come at a human cost, as seen in cases where workers were exposed to traumatic content.

4. **Ethical Concerns**: There have been instances where chatGPT has provided information on illegal activities like bomb making, prompting OpenAI and other entities to add guardrails and filters to prevent such responses.

5. **Industry Impact**: Generative AI is expected to affect various industries, including journalism, law, translation, and programming by automating certain tasks or providing assistance. However, there's skepticism about the extent of its impact on job displacement, with some experts arguing that it's more of an incremental innovation rather than a disruptive force.

6. **Adaptation**: In response to AI tools like chatGPT, some school districts have banned their use to prevent academic dishonesty. Educators are exploring alternative methods to ensure the integrity of student work.

7. **Ownership and Creativity**: Image-generating AI programs have raised questions about creativity and intellectual property rights. Some experts believe that while AI can augment human abilities, it cannot replace the depth of understanding and creativity found in the human brain.

8. **Future Opportunities**: There's an optimistic view that AI will primarily eliminate mundane tasks, freeing up knowledge workers to engage in more creative and complex work, thus potentially creating more opportunities rather than diminishing them.

9. **AI's Nuanced Perspective**: As for AI like chatGPT itself, it acknowledges its potential to impact the world significantly, but emphasizes that this impact will largely depend on how responsibly AI is used and developed. Responsible usage is seen as crucial to ensure a positive outcome of AI integration into society.
