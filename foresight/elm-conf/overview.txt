Checking elm-conf/＂Immutable Relational Data＂ by Richard Feldman.txt
1. **State Synchronization Challenges**: Managing state synchronization across multiple sources of truth can lead to issues like tweet storms, which are hard to debug and maintain. It's preferable to have a single source of truth to avoid these problems.

2. **Relational Data with Immutability**: You can model relational data immutably using a single source of truth in Elm. This eliminates the need for state synchronization because there's nothing to synchronize.

3. **Synchronization Work**: If you have multiple sources of truth, you must handle updates, detect errors, resolve conflicts, and recover gracefully from any issues that arise.

4. **Using Dictionaries as Tables**: In Elm, dictionaries can be used to model relationships between different entities, similar to tables in a relational database. This allows for complex data modeling without mutable references.

5. **Avoiding Duplicate Information**: Generally, you should avoid duplicating information in your model unless there's a proven performance issue that requires a cache. Caching should be used judiciously and only when necessary.

6. **Performing Complex Queries**: To perform complex queries like selecting voting age users who live in St. Louis, you can use Elm's built-in list operations to filter and intersect dictionaries, effectively simulating SQL-like queries within the immutable data structures.

7. **Best Practices**: The best approach is to use a single source of truth for your data, leverage immutability, and use dictionaries to model relationships when needed. This keeps your codebase clean, maintainable, and free from the complexities associated with state synchronization across multiple sources of truth.

8. **Resources**: For those interested in learning more about data modeling in Elm, the book "Elm in Action" by Bailey Fry is recommended. It provides a deeper dive into these concepts and techniques.
