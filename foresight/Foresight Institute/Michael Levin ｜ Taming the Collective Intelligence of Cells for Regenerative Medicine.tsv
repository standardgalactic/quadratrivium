0	2480	Welcome, everyone, to Forsyth's Biotech and Health Extension
2480	4960	Group, sponsored by 100 Plus Capital.
4960	7440	I'm so filled to have Michael Levine here today.
7440	10160	He was recommended by someone whose recommendations
10160	11200	I hold very highly.
11200	12680	So I'm terribly excited for your talk.
12680	14600	I think you're tying together a variety
14600	16360	of different super interesting fields.
16360	18240	You're definitely, I think, pushing the envelope
18240	20200	with the research that you do.
20200	22960	I will say no more and let you guys
22960	23760	the conversation.
23760	25600	We'll have a little break halfway through,
25600	27240	in which we'll have a few announcements
27240	29280	from people in the community, and then
29280	30640	we'll go for a longer discussion.
30640	33440	I think Michael already said he can stay a little longer.
33440	36760	But this is just a reminder from me on the beginning
36760	39280	that I will, in a second, prompt you in the chat
39280	40880	to ask questions.
40880	43920	And usually what happens at the end of these talks
43920	47080	is that we have lots of questions and not the time
47080	48120	to cover them all.
48120	48960	So don't be shy.
48960	49760	Ask them early.
49760	51960	Then we can start uploading, downloading questions.
51960	54120	Because usually at the end of it, we always
54120	56280	try to keep them as short as possible.
56280	58880	But why not start early with asking questions?
58880	61280	So thank you so, so, so much for joining today.
61280	63680	And Michael, it's really a pleasure to finally have you on.
63680	65640	We scheduled this a while back already.
65640	67840	And you're going to tell us lots of things
67840	70200	about regenerative medicine that I think
70200	73160	many people here don't even have on the radar yet at all.
73160	75360	You're leading the Taft Center for Regenerative
75360	76760	and Developmental Biology.
76760	78920	I will post more on your bio in the chat.
78920	80240	For now, please take it away.
80240	81760	I'm really thrilled to have you here.
81760	83600	And thank you for joining.
83600	84640	Thank you so much.
84640	87760	And yeah, thank you for having me and for the opportunity
87760	90880	to speak to you all about this.
90880	94280	So let's see, can everybody see my slide?
94280	94960	Yeah, perfect.
94960	97520	OK, so you see here two websites.
97520	99800	Please feel free to get in touch with me afterwards
99800	101680	if you have any questions that we don't cover.
101680	103480	Everything is there, all the primary papers
103480	105160	and everything else is there.
105160	106840	And I have to do a disclosure.
106840	109120	I have a spin-off company called Morphosuticals Inc.
109120	111000	with David Kaplan.
111000	113880	And I'll tell you a little bit more about that.
113920	119160	So I want to give the main point of the talk right up front.
119160	120800	And here are the four things that I'm
120800	122680	going to try to transmit today.
122680	126600	I think that solving the problem of anatomical homeostasis,
126600	130000	which I will discuss, is the key to really transformative
130000	132120	regenerative medicine, which will address aging
132120	134320	as well as many other things.
134320	137520	And that the current approaches focusing
137520	140400	on stem cell biology, genomic editing, things like this
140400	142520	are limited by themselves.
142520	144640	And that what is really, really key
144640	147040	is to understand the software of life.
147040	148960	And I'll show you some examples of that.
148960	152640	A key medium by which cells compute and make decisions
152640	156440	in vivo is what we call non-neural bioelectricity.
156440	159560	And it now turns out that we have learned to read and write
159560	162520	various goal states into the collective intelligence
162520	163200	of tissues.
163200	164920	And I'll show you some examples of that.
164920	166680	And I think fundamentally that cracking
166680	170400	this bioelectric code, which is a sort of evolutionary precursor
170400	173040	to the electric code that our brains use,
173040	176360	will enable a really profound new class of electroseuticals
176360	179000	with lots of new applications in birth defects,
179000	181320	regenerative medicine, cancer, aging,
181320	182880	and synthetic bioengineering.
182880	184440	So those are my main points.
184440	187120	If we boil down the whole talk to one sentence,
187120	190000	what I'm here to tell you is that, like the brain,
190000	192640	all of your body cells and tissues make decisions.
192640	195720	And these are decisions about structure and function.
195720	197760	And that we can now, we have the techniques
197800	201560	to actually read the information processing that
201560	204800	goes into those decisions and actually modify it rationally.
204800	207560	And what you see here is one of our five-legged frogs.
207560	209080	And this is my reminder to tell you
209080	211160	that you're going to see all kinds of weird-looking creatures
211160	211560	today.
211560	212880	And that is not Photoshop.
212880	216040	These are actual real animals that we produce as a means
216040	219400	of testing our theories of where shape comes from
219400	221720	and how to control.
221720	224760	So let's talk first about some fundamental knowledge gaps.
224760	227000	I want to highlight what it is that we don't know,
227040	232400	despite all of our amazing advances in molecular biology.
232400	234760	So what we would like to have is something
234760	237480	we call the anatomical compiler.
237480	239280	The idea is that someday you should
239280	241080	be able to sit down at a computer
241080	244440	and draw the animal or plant that you would like to have.
244440	249920	So not try to create a bottom up from a description of pathways.
249920	251640	You shouldn't need to think about pathways.
251640	254960	You should be able to, like we do for computer-aided design,
254960	256240	when the field is mature, you should
256240	259480	be able to sit down and say, I want a three-headed flatworm
259480	261400	with a shape that roughly looks like this.
261400	264600	And what the compiler would do is convert that anatomical
264600	267280	description into the set of stimuli
267280	269720	that have to be given to those cells to produce whatever
269720	271120	it is that you ask for.
271120	272920	That's the end game for this field.
272920	275200	It's complete and total control of morphology.
275200	277240	And it might be a liver, and it might be a heart,
277240	279320	and it might be a whole organism,
279320	282040	or it might be something that's never existed on Earth before.
282040	283000	It shouldn't matter.
283000	286840	We should be able to take a description of the anatomy
286840	291560	that we want and to figure out what stimuli would
291560	294040	have to be given to cells to be able to produce it.
294040	296560	And the critical thing is that if we could do this,
296560	300200	we would immediately have all the answers to birth defects,
300200	303040	to regenerating lost or damaged organs,
303040	306040	to the defection from the body plan known as cancer,
306040	308840	to aging, to all of these challenges
308840	311760	to the normal healthy morphology of a body.
311800	313960	And so this is fundamentally a problem of information
313960	316040	processing, as I will argue.
316040	319160	And so the question is, why don't we have this yet?
319160	321640	Genomics has proceeded very rapidly.
321640	322760	Why do we not have this?
322760	325280	Because, of course, we don't have anything remotely like this.
325280	329280	Our control over anatomy is still extremely poor.
329280	331840	And so the reason is because there
331840	334880	are fundamental gaps in our understanding.
334880	336880	And I'll just give you a very simple example.
336880	339200	So here on the left, you see an axolotl.
339200	341960	And axolotl larvae have legs.
341960	343680	And on the right, you see a frog larva.
343680	345240	And frog larvae do not have legs.
345240	346760	The tadpoles don't have legs.
346760	348440	And one can do a thought experiment
348440	350960	and say that, well, at the early embryonic stage,
350960	353120	I'm going to take 50% of the axolotl embryo,
353120	355480	50% of the frog embryo, I'm going to mix them up,
355480	357120	and I'm going to make a frog allotl.
357120	359120	And it turns out the cells do perfectly fine.
359120	361560	They actually do work together.
361560	363480	But now I ask you a simple question.
363480	365640	Will the frog allotl have legs?
365640	367040	You have access to both genomes.
367040	368600	You have access to the axolotl genome.
368600	370280	You have access to the frog genome.
370280	371840	Will the frog allotl have legs?
371840	374880	And if so, will the legs be made entirely of axolotl cells?
374880	376480	Or will they recruit the frog cells?
376480	377920	The point is we have no idea.
377920	380800	And until we do the experiment, of course, right?
380800	383080	So even having the genomic sequence,
383080	385160	these basic fundamental questions
385160	387080	about what shape is going to result
387080	388640	are something that we cannot yet answer.
388640	391560	And that really holds back regenerative medicine.
391560	393840	And so let's just ask the fundamental question,
393840	395360	where does shape come from?
395360	399200	And so we all start life as this sort of ball
399200	400560	of embryonic blastomers.
400560	402920	And then here you see a cross-section
402920	404160	through the human torso.
404160	406600	So look at this incredible arrangement.
406600	409120	All the organs are in exactly the right place,
409120	412040	orientation, size, position relative to each other.
412040	413560	Where does all this come from?
413560	417240	And if you might be tempted to say the genome,
417240	419560	and so the genome certainly produces
419560	421920	the cellular hardware that you need to create this.
421920	424400	So the genome gives you all the protein sequences,
424400	426280	but the genome doesn't directly say anything
426280	427720	about this kind of order.
427720	432240	It's simply not there in that way.
432240	434160	And so we really need to understand
434160	438280	how do cell groups know what to make and when to stop, right?
438280	442600	It's a collective, it's a collective intelligence problem
442600	445440	in the sense that all of these cells are active agents
445440	446920	that do various things.
446920	448400	And the result of their activity
448400	451200	is to self-assemble this amazing organism.
451200	453320	And as part of understanding this process,
453320	455920	we need to ask, first of all, in regenerative medicine,
455920	456960	if part of this is missing,
456960	459440	how do we convince the cells to rebuild it again?
459440	461800	And as engineers, we might ask, well, what else could we build?
461800	463280	Could we build something completely different
463280	464800	out of these same cells?
464800	466560	And so this central question
466560	469640	of where anatomical order comes from
469640	471840	and how do we control it is the key, I think,
471840	476400	to really profound changes in how we do medicine.
476400	479680	So the important thing is that single cells
479680	481120	are incredibly competent.
481120	484760	So here you have this creature is called the lacrimaria.
484760	488440	And you can see what it's doing, it's hunting,
488440	492000	it handles all of its physiological, its anatomical,
492000	494400	and its behavioral needs all in one cell.
494400	496400	There is no brain, there's no nervous system,
496400	497360	there are no stem cells,
497360	499800	there's no cell-to-cell communication, it's one cell.
499800	501600	And it's doing everything it needs
501600	503560	on the scale of one cell.
503560	506480	Now, when cells get together,
506480	510480	they actually scale up this ability
510480	512280	and they work on much bigger goals.
512280	514520	And these goals are the production
514520	518560	of complex invariant anatomy, such as these here.
518560	523560	And we know that simply differentiating stem cells
523640	526400	into particular tissue types is not sufficient
526400	528440	because then you can get something like this down here,
528440	529760	which is a teratoma.
529760	532680	So this is a tumor that might have skin and hair
532680	534920	and teeth and bone and muscle.
534920	537120	And the reason this is not a good embryo
537960	541440	is because it's missing that three-dimensional organization,
541440	542280	that structure.
542280	544600	All the stem cell differentiation proceeded fine.
544600	546600	You've got your cell types,
546600	548520	you've got your mature derivatives,
548520	550920	but they're not arranged in the correct place.
550920	552640	So it's not enough to have the building blocks,
552640	555880	you actually need to specify how they get together.
555880	559860	And so there's a kind of a mainstream paradigm
559860	562880	which thinks about a feed-forward emergent process
562880	564400	where you have gene regulatory networks
564400	566320	and these genes turn each other on and off,
566320	568080	they make proteins, some of these proteins
568080	570360	that are sticky or they exert force or they diffuse
570360	571200	and so on.
571200	572880	And as a result, there's this process
572880	574480	of what they call emergence.
574480	577560	And at the end, something really complex from top.
577560	579680	And the difficulty with this paradigm
579680	581600	for regenerative medicine is that
581600	583200	if you want to make changes here,
583200	585560	if you want to make repairs to the anatomy,
585560	589920	you have to somehow invert this chain
589920	591840	to figure out what are you going to do back here?
591840	593240	Which genes are you going to edit
593280	596520	and how in order to make complex anatomical changes?
596520	600160	And that inverse problem is fundamentally intractable.
600160	601600	It's extremely difficult.
601600	604520	And so this is basically what's holding
604520	605440	back regenerative medicine.
605440	607640	You simply don't know how to figure out
607640	610520	what changes to make at the very lowest levels
610520	614520	to give you the desired effects at the system level.
614520	616560	And so what we're very good at in the field
616560	618040	is figuring out things like this,
618040	620600	which genes and proteins control each other
620600	621920	and so on these pathways.
621920	624000	But what we really want to understand is this,
624000	626280	where do these different shapes come from
626280	628760	and what do we do when we want to alter
628760	631480	the rationally, okay.
631480	635600	So I should point out that it's not only
635600	640120	about creating a complex body during embryogenesis,
640120	642520	it's also about the amazing ability
642520	645600	of the cellular collectives to repair over time.
645600	649560	So here what you see here is an animal called an axolotl.
649560	651560	So this is a Mexican salamander.
651680	653440	These animals throughout their lifespan
653440	655720	regenerate their eyes, their limbs,
655720	659000	their ovaries, portions of their heart and brain
659000	660240	and their spinal cords.
660240	662600	So they will sort of bite off each other's legs
662600	665120	all the time and if you keep them in an aquarium
665120	666320	and the legs grow back.
666320	670000	And so here's what happens no matter where you amputate
670000	671960	or where they lose it along this axis,
671960	675080	they will do exactly the correct amount of growth
675080	677720	and patterning and then you have an indistinguishable limb
677720	678600	at the end.
678600	682000	And so what's remarkable about this
682000	687000	is not only that it rapidly grows
687480	689760	and creates the correct tissues
689760	692440	that actually stops at the right time.
692440	694760	The fact that regeneration stops is really amazing.
694760	696400	Think about it, when does it stop?
696400	699400	It stops when a correct salamander limb has formed.
699400	702040	And until then it has really rapid proliferation
702040	705000	and cell movement and changes in gene expression.
705000	706720	But all of that grinds to a halt
706720	709520	when a correct salamander limb has formed.
709520	711560	How does it know what a correct salamander limb is?
711560	712760	How does it know when to stop?
712760	714600	Because this is not simply a process
714600	716120	that always starts at the egg,
716120	720400	proceeds during a set of hardwired steps and then stops.
720400	723040	This is a flexible process that you can interrupt,
723040	725520	you can make changes, you can cut at any point
725520	727480	and it will pick up exactly at the right spot,
727480	729600	do what's needed and then stop when it's done.
729600	732000	So there's a degree of plasticity
732000	735060	and adaptive problem solving here.
735060	739540	So of course, axolotls are not the only creatures
739540	741940	that regenerate, so the human liver is regenerative
741940	743540	and even the ancient Greeks knew that,
743540	745140	I don't know how they knew that, but they did.
745140	749860	As you see here, deer are a large adult mammal
749860	753460	that every year regenerates huge amounts of bone
753460	756060	and skin and innervation and vasculature.
756060	758980	These antlers grow up to a rate of a centimeter
758980	760260	and a half per day.
760260	762300	Think about that, a centimeter and a half of new bone
762300	764860	per day is possible in mammals.
764860	768060	And even human children, usually below the age
768060	769780	of somewhere between seven and 11,
769780	772420	if they amputate their fingertips,
772420	773860	if you don't sew it over with skin,
773860	775900	but just sort of keep it clean, they will regenerate.
775900	779020	So even human children initially have some regenerability
779020	783260	to regenerate their fingers and then it goes away.
784700	788340	So these here are, I think, the champions of regeneration
788340	792820	and this should be a really motivational
792820	795020	and sort of aspirational animal for us all
795020	797540	who are interested in healthy lifespans.
797540	798860	This is a planarian.
798860	801180	These animals have a couple of interesting properties.
801180	802660	First of all, they're a complex animal
802660	804980	with a true brain and bilateral symmetry.
804980	806020	They're not like earthworms.
806020	809940	These are similar to our direct ancestor, okay?
809940	812700	They, first of all, have the ability of regeneration.
812700	817340	So you can cut them into any pieces along any plane.
817340	820500	The record is something like 276 pieces.
820500	823140	Every piece will regenerate exactly what's missing,
823140	823980	no more, no less,
823980	825900	and give you a perfect tiny little worm.
825900	827460	Every piece, they regenerate their brain,
827460	828740	every other organ.
828740	831540	Not only that, they're smart, so they can learn.
831540	832660	They have the ability to learn
832660	834820	in a variety of behavioral assays.
834820	836820	And best of all, they are immortal.
836820	839380	There is no such thing as an old planarian.
839380	842620	So individual cells senesce and fall off
842620	844380	and they regenerate whatever's missing
844380	846020	and they just keep on going.
846020	847900	And so what these guys are telling us
847900	851460	is that it is possible to be an immortal,
851460	855060	highly regenerative creature that also has intelligence.
855060	858100	This is not only for CNM and these and things like this.
858100	860700	You can actually be a bilaterian with a true brain,
860700	863300	all the same neurotransmitters that we have,
863300	864940	and be immortal, okay?
864940	868140	So this is a proof of principle right here,
868140	869660	an existence proof.
869660	873380	So one of the really important concepts
873380	875500	to try and understand how all this works
875500	880100	is really the idea of problem solving
880100	882020	by the collective intelligence of cells.
882020	883420	And I wanna show you just one example,
883420	885700	there are many examples, I wanna show you one example.
885700	888660	Here is a tadpole face and here's some eyes
888660	890260	and the brain and the nostrils.
890260	892020	And tadpoles need to become frogs.
892020	895060	And in order to become frogs, they rearrange their face.
895060	897460	So the nostrils have to move, the eyes have to move forward,
897460	899860	the jaws have to move, all these things have to move around.
899860	901700	And it used to be thought that somehow
901700	904420	what the genetics does is it gives you
904420	906700	a hardwired set of movements.
906700	908180	After all, all tadpoles look the same
908180	909100	and all frogs look the same.
909100	911860	So as long as everything moves in the right way,
911860	914300	you should get from a normal tadpole to a normal frog.
914300	916860	So what we did was we made so-called Picasso tadpoles
916860	918580	where everything is in the wrong place.
918580	920740	So the eyes are off kilter,
920740	922420	the nose is not where it's supposed to be,
922420	923700	the jaws are on the side of the head,
923700	926420	everything's not where it's supposed to be.
926420	930340	So when this happens, what we find is that
930340	932980	they still make largely normal frogs.
932980	933820	Why?
933820	935460	Because all of the different components
935460	938580	move around in novel paths, okay?
938580	940420	And in fact, sometimes they go too far
940420	941860	and have to back up and come back,
941860	943380	but they all move around
943380	946140	until they get pretty much to a normal frog face.
946140	947060	And this is remarkable.
947060	950060	This means that what the genetics actually gives you
950060	953340	is a machine that is able to minimize error,
953340	955580	that it has some internal representation
955580	958060	of what a correct frog face looks like.
958100	961260	And when you start it off in the wrong configuration,
961260	965420	something that never appears during normal embryogenesis,
965420	967820	no problem, they can still navigate morphospace,
967820	970900	they can navigate a path to where they need to be
970900	974060	from this completely unexpected starting position.
974060	977460	So this, if we had a swarm robotics instance
977460	979060	that was able to do this, instead of cells,
979060	980900	we have little robots that could do this,
980900	985180	this would be a remarkable example
985180	986180	of collective intelligence.
986180	987500	And so it is here.
987500	991620	These are groups of cells that are able to solve this problem
991620	994420	from different starting configurations.
994420	997340	And this is the process that collective intelligence
997340	1000020	and that problem solving is what we need to solve
1000020	1002700	in addition to all of the mechanistic advances
1002700	1005020	over the component pathways
1005020	1008360	in order to really control anatomy
1008360	1010940	and to really solve regenerative medicine.
1010940	1015180	So what we would like to do is to try to move
1015180	1016940	to a point where we really understand this
1016940	1018540	at an algorithmic level,
1018540	1021780	not just the mechanisms that are required for this to happen,
1021780	1025300	but the algorithms that are sufficient for this to happen.
1025300	1026980	And we really need to understand
1026980	1029860	how these cellular collectives process information
1029860	1032420	and how reprogrammable really is it.
1032420	1037420	So computer science offers us an interesting analogy.
1038580	1042140	Back in the 1940s and 50s, this is what programming looked
1042140	1042980	like.
1042980	1043820	So in order to program this computer,
1043820	1045900	you have to physically move the wires around.
1045900	1049700	You have to physically change the structure of the machine.
1049700	1053620	And since then, the journey that computer science has taken
1053620	1056180	is to realize that if your hardware is good enough,
1056180	1057740	if it's reprogrammable,
1057740	1060240	then you don't need to physically change the hardware.
1060240	1061860	What you can do is interact with it
1061860	1064260	by means of inputs or experiences
1064260	1066620	and take advantage of the software that's in the system
1066620	1068820	and the plasticity that's in the system.
1068820	1071060	So of course, what you'll notice
1071060	1073620	that all of modern biology is basically down here
1073620	1074460	at this point.
1075100	1079100	All of the exciting advances are single molecule approaches.
1079100	1082100	We're rewiring pathways, genomic editing.
1082100	1085100	Everything is about getting more and more specific
1085100	1087100	at the low level of the hardware.
1087100	1088740	And these are very important things,
1088740	1092060	but they need to be coupled with an understanding
1092060	1093740	of what the software looks like
1093740	1095700	and how much we can get done with stimuli,
1095700	1099980	not with rewiring, whether it be genetic or otherwise.
1099980	1102220	And so the framework that we work in
1102220	1103700	looks a little bit more like this,
1103740	1106700	where yes, there's this feed forward component,
1106700	1109820	but there's also a very important set of feedback loops
1109820	1111540	where any challenge to the body,
1111540	1113100	and this could be traumatic injury,
1113100	1115580	this could be aging, this could be teratogens,
1115580	1119780	pathogens, whatever triggers a set of feedback loops,
1119780	1121980	both at the level of physics and genetics
1121980	1125900	that serves to get back to the correct target morphology.
1125900	1127280	Anybody that's taken engineering
1127280	1131020	will immediately recognize this as a homeostatic cycle.
1131020	1132340	It's basically what you have
1132700	1134180	in your thermostatic home,
1134180	1137460	where this is a system that's able to regulate
1137460	1139220	back to the correct state.
1139220	1144220	Now, of course, feedback is not new,
1144740	1148460	biologists all understand about the importance of feedback,
1148460	1150620	but there are two unusual things here in this model
1150620	1151900	that I'm going to talk about.
1151900	1153620	The first is that the set point
1153620	1156620	for this homeostatic process is not a simple number
1156620	1159260	or a scalar, like a temperature or pH or hunger level
1159260	1160420	or anything like that.
1160420	1162860	It's actually a much more complex structure
1162860	1164860	that's a coarse-graining of the anatomy.
1164860	1167380	So large-scale patterning information
1167380	1170700	is what's guiding this homeostatic process.
1170700	1172980	And the second part that's kind of unusual
1172980	1175940	is that this is a process that has a goal.
1175940	1180300	And when I say goal, this is not in some mystical sense,
1180300	1183660	it's basically in the sense of cybernetics
1183660	1184540	and control theory.
1184540	1186700	There's a set point, and this is a system
1186700	1190220	that's fundamentally able to expand energy and effort
1190220	1193100	to get back to the correct region of state space
1193100	1197300	by activating all kinds of cellular behaviors
1197300	1200300	to get back as close as possible to minimize error
1200300	1201460	and minimize the difference
1201460	1203300	between whatever the current shape is
1203300	1204980	and the shape that it's supposed to have.
1204980	1206260	So if you make that hypothesis,
1206260	1208820	it has a couple of strong predictions.
1208820	1212500	One strong prediction is that you ought to be able to find
1212500	1215700	the medium in which that target morphology is encoded.
1215700	1218420	So the set point has to be recorded somewhere.
1218420	1221460	And then it means that you could alter that set point,
1221460	1223940	you could rewrite it and ask the machine
1223940	1227460	to build something different without having to rewire it.
1227460	1229140	In the same way that you can set your thermostat
1229140	1231100	to a different temperature,
1231100	1233380	and the exact same system will now maintain
1233380	1234380	a different temperature
1234380	1236860	because there's a distinction between the data
1236860	1238340	and the execution here.
1238340	1239980	So this is what we've been doing in my group
1239980	1241540	for some years now is saying,
1241540	1244420	can we find the representation of the target morphology
1244420	1246660	and exploit it for regenerative medicine?
1247060	1249540	And I think we found an important chunk of it.
1249540	1251580	And so in order to tell you
1251580	1253780	how that target morphology is encoded,
1253780	1256980	I have to introduce you to developmental bioelectricity.
1256980	1261020	And all cells in the body are sitting
1261020	1263860	in a morphogenetic field of information
1263860	1266820	that comes in all kinds of different media.
1266820	1268180	So there's chemical gradients,
1268180	1271500	extracellular matrix, tensions and stresses and so on.
1271500	1275100	And then the one that we're interested in is bioelectricity.
1275100	1277780	So bioelectricity is not the only important layer,
1277780	1280620	but it's a, I think, a uniquely powerful and interesting one.
1280620	1283020	And that's the one we'll be talking about now.
1283020	1284700	Okay, so what is bioelectricity?
1284700	1286620	Well, let's think about what happens in the brain.
1286620	1291620	In the brain, you have networks of these cells called neurons.
1291900	1293180	They all have ion channels.
1293180	1294980	They create voltage potentials
1294980	1297700	by passing ions in and out of these ion channels.
1297700	1299900	And they can pass those electrical states
1299900	1302980	to their neighbors through these little electrical synapse.
1302980	1305100	The synapse is known as gap junctions.
1305100	1308020	And networks of these cells have this really interesting
1308020	1312380	property that they can execute physiological
1312380	1315180	information processing that we associate with memory,
1315180	1317460	with behavior, with goal-directed activity,
1317460	1319100	with preferences and so on.
1319100	1320980	And so what you can see here is an example
1320980	1323860	of tracking electrical activity in the brain.
1323860	1325380	So this happens to be a zebrafish,
1325380	1327980	thinking about whatever the zebrafish think about.
1327980	1331020	And you can literally see the electrical activity
1331020	1333140	and neuroscience has the following commitment.
1333140	1336220	We think that if we understood the encoding,
1336220	1338740	if we understood the neural electric code,
1338740	1340460	we could look at this electrical activity
1340460	1342660	and extract the semantic information.
1342660	1346380	We would know what is the meaning to the animal?
1346380	1349220	What is the content of that memory
1349220	1350420	of whatever it's thinking about?
1350420	1352060	Okay, and so people are working on
1352060	1355940	and have had some success with all kinds of decoding methods
1355940	1357420	to try and pull that information
1357420	1359540	out of electrical activity in the brain.
1359540	1361140	Well, you can sort of ask yourself,
1361140	1362140	where did this all come from?
1362140	1365220	Certainly this didn't just evolve out of nowhere.
1365220	1369700	It must have had a simpler evolutionary precursor,
1369700	1370460	and it did.
1370460	1372140	The evolutionary precursor is the fact
1372140	1374500	that all cells do this, not just neurons.
1374500	1376380	So every cell has high-end channels.
1376380	1379300	Most cells have gap junctions to their neighbors.
1379300	1383660	And this kind of scheme of putting
1383660	1386820	electrically active subunits into networks
1386820	1388740	is about as old as bacterial biofilms.
1388740	1391220	It's an extremely ancient evolutionary thing.
1391220	1392340	And all cells do this.
1392340	1396340	And so what you're seeing here is an early frog embryo
1396340	1399740	in time-lapse, where the cells are having discussions
1399740	1401900	with each other electrically about who's going to be
1401900	1403940	if anterior, posterior, left, right,
1403940	1405460	dorsal ventral, and so on.
1405460	1409700	Because whereas the electrical activity in the brain
1409700	1412700	is designed to move, to activate muscles to move the body
1412700	1415340	to solve problems in three-dimensional space,
1415340	1417500	what developmental bioelectricity does
1417540	1421060	is process information to move the body through morphospace
1421060	1424100	to change and control morphogenesis.
1424100	1426380	And we can do this, the exact same thing here.
1426380	1429860	We can try to decode this to try to understand
1429860	1432780	how is it that specific patterns arise
1432780	1434300	and how can we change them?
1435300	1439100	So my lab has developed some tools to do this.
1439100	1443740	So first, here are voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes.
1443740	1445580	And this is my colleague, Danny Adams,
1445580	1447500	who has perfected this particular technique
1447500	1448980	of using voltage reporters.
1448980	1452100	So this is not a model, this is an actual embryo,
1452100	1455780	using these voltage dyes to read in real time
1455780	1457740	all the electrical conversations
1457740	1459260	that these cells are having.
1459260	1461620	We, of course, do lots of computational modeling.
1461620	1464700	And then more importantly, we have functional techniques
1464700	1467660	where you can go in and change
1467660	1470820	the electrical information processing in the tissue.
1470820	1473940	We do not use electrodes, applied electric fields,
1473940	1475780	there's no electromagnetics going on.
1475780	1478580	This is purely molecular physiology
1478580	1481980	to target the native processes
1481980	1484700	by which these cells are communicating electrically.
1484700	1489700	So there are ways to control the topology of the network,
1490460	1492740	so which cells talk to each other cells
1492740	1494060	through these gap junctions.
1494060	1495460	We can open them, we can close them,
1495460	1496860	we can mutate them and so on.
1496860	1498500	And the same thing for the ion channels.
1498500	1501460	We can go in and literally set the electrical states
1501460	1505060	you could either optogenetics or drugs or mutations
1505060	1507020	that change the channel properties.
1507020	1510820	So basically taking all the tools of neuroscience
1510820	1514700	and using them to control morphogenetic decision-making
1514700	1517540	outside of the nervous system.
1517540	1520140	And so this is just a simple example
1520140	1522620	of what some of these endogenous patterns look like.
1522620	1524540	Here you see, again, a time lapse,
1524540	1527860	this embryo is putting its tadpole face together.
1527860	1530540	You can see all the dynamic electrical patterns.
1530580	1532580	Here's one frame from that movie.
1532580	1533460	And the amazing thing is,
1533460	1535340	and the reason I love this example so much
1535340	1537780	is that the encoding is really simple here.
1537780	1539700	The electric, we call this the electric face.
1539700	1542620	The bi-electric pattern of the face actually looks like a face.
1542620	1545660	And this shows up before the genes are turned on
1546580	1549380	to regionalize the face.
1549380	1550220	And so here you can see,
1550220	1551620	here's where the eye is going to be,
1551620	1552540	here are the placodes,
1552540	1554260	here's where the mouth is going to be.
1554260	1557620	All these bi-electrical gradients are a pre-pattern.
1557620	1559340	They're a subtle scaffold
1559340	1562140	that directs downstream gene expression and anatomy.
1562140	1565260	And if we go in and we change the distribution
1565260	1566420	of voltages here,
1566420	1567820	you will change the gene expression
1567820	1568900	and you will change the anatomy.
1568900	1570940	That is one way to make those Picasso tadpoles
1570940	1571980	that I showed you about.
1571980	1576780	So this is a native pattern that is required.
1576780	1579900	It's a normal, natural part of specifying
1579900	1581740	what the tadpole face is going to look like.
1581740	1583420	Here's a pathological pattern.
1583420	1585180	What we've done here is,
1585180	1588460	what we've done here is inject a human oncogene
1588460	1589300	into this tadpole.
1589300	1591020	They will make tumors like this.
1591020	1592140	But before they do,
1592140	1596060	you can already see using this bi-electric map,
1596060	1598340	you can already see that these cells
1598340	1600540	have a really aberrant electrical potential.
1600540	1602980	They are dissociating from the electrical network.
1602980	1606260	They're basically reverting back to their unicellular state
1606260	1607900	and they're going to treat the rest of the animal
1607900	1609260	as just external environment.
1609260	1611180	They've unplugged from the collective
1611180	1612380	and this is metastasis.
1613340	1616300	This is failure to participate in embryogenesis
1616300	1617980	because the first thing that oncogenes do
1617980	1620940	is uncouple you from the electric network
1620940	1623860	that normally tells every cell what it should be doing.
1624980	1627260	So the reason we know this is important
1627260	1629460	is that if you inject tumors
1629460	1631980	like nasty KRAS mutations and so on,
1631980	1634860	if you inject these things and cause tumors,
1634860	1637500	you can prevent the actual tumor genesis
1637500	1639780	even though the oncogene is very strongly expressed.
1639780	1641460	So here, this is the same animal.
1641460	1644420	So here's the oncogene that we've labeled it with red,
1644420	1647860	very strongly expressed and yet there's no tumor
1647860	1649860	because what we've done is co-inject an ion channel
1649860	1653220	that forces these cells into a voltage state
1653220	1656020	that keeps them coupled to the rest of the electrical network
1656020	1657740	and they simply don't progress
1657740	1660980	to tumor genesis or metastasis.
1660980	1662980	So we know this is instructive.
1662980	1665980	Now, going beyond the single cell property
1665980	1669220	of conversion to cancer,
1669220	1670500	we could look at morphogenesis
1670500	1672460	and we can say, okay, here's a tadpole.
1672460	1674300	Let's take a region of the gut.
1674300	1676100	So here, these are some cells in the embryo
1676100	1677660	that are going to become gut
1677660	1679620	and we're going to inject some ion channels
1679620	1681940	that will set a voltage state
1681940	1684380	that normally is associated with making an eye.
1684380	1685220	And guess what happens?
1685220	1687100	These cells, once you instruct them that way,
1687100	1688580	they will in fact build an eye
1688580	1690860	out of cells that were fated to be gut
1690860	1692140	and you can make these eyes anywhere,
1692140	1694580	on the tails, spinal cord, in the gut, whatever.
1694580	1696420	They have all the correct layers,
1696420	1698260	the retina, optic nerve, all of that.
1698340	1701420	And also pretty cool is that they instruct their neighbors.
1701420	1703260	So these blue cells here are the ones
1703260	1704620	whose voltage we changed
1704620	1706580	and they recruited a whole bunch of other cells
1706580	1708060	which we never touched directly, right?
1708060	1709700	These are just neighboring cells
1709700	1711900	that they recruit to make this nice lens
1711900	1715460	that's sitting out in the tail of this tadpole.
1715460	1717460	And so we can use this technique.
1717460	1721740	We can induce eyes, brains, hearts and other things.
1721740	1723180	And then there's many things that we can't,
1723180	1724420	we don't know how to make it.
1724420	1726620	So the point is that these bioelectrical gradients
1726620	1729020	are instructive for anatomy.
1729020	1731220	They control at the large scale.
1731220	1734060	And one of the most important features of this
1734060	1736860	is that we don't have to micromanage this process.
1736860	1741100	So what we basically found is an instructive hooking
1741100	1743380	to subroutines that say make an eye here
1743380	1745180	or make a heart here or make a brain here.
1745180	1747180	We don't have to go in and give all the information about,
1747180	1748100	well, how do you make an eye?
1748100	1749180	What are all the layers?
1749180	1751140	What are all the cell differentiation cascades?
1751140	1752860	What are all the genes that have to be expressed?
1752860	1754340	That would be incredibly difficult.
1754340	1756420	We're nowhere near being able to do that
1756420	1758500	as a field, but what you can do
1758500	1763500	is find the native modular control structure
1764900	1767420	in the bioelectric layer
1767420	1770900	that determines which organs get placed in what regions.
1770900	1772660	And then the cells will take it from there
1772660	1774380	once you've instructed them what to do.
1774380	1777420	They will turn on all the things they need.
1777420	1779260	So let's look at the planaria
1779260	1781500	because this is really interesting.
1781500	1783900	In a planarian, you chop off the head and the tail.
1783900	1784980	You got this middle fragment,
1785220	1788060	the middle fragment has to know to build a new head here
1788060	1789020	and a new tail here.
1789020	1790180	How does it know to do that?
1790180	1792020	Well, it has this interesting voltage gradient
1792020	1794540	that says one head here in this depolarized region,
1794540	1795620	one tail here.
1795620	1798220	And if we go in and we artificially manipulate
1798220	1800580	the voltage back here to be depolarized,
1800580	1802740	then sure enough, these cells will build what you said
1802740	1804460	and they will make a two-headed animal.
1804460	1805820	And these are perfectly viable.
1805820	1807060	So you can make a two-headed animal,
1807060	1808980	you can make a no-headed animal, okay?
1808980	1810580	So again, instructive,
1810580	1813940	and all we've done is activate the build ahead subroutine
1813940	1816220	and we've done it here at this particular region
1816220	1818460	without actually knowing too much about how you go
1818460	1820060	about building ahead in the first place.
1820060	1824300	The cells will turn on and off all the genes that they need
1824300	1826980	once they've received this high-level instruction
1826980	1829780	about what organ they're supposed to build.
1829780	1833380	Not only can you build ectopic heads of the same animal,
1833380	1836460	you can actually build heads appropriate to other species.
1836460	1838540	Okay, so if we take this planarian
1838540	1841420	with a nice triangular head here, chop off the head,
1841420	1843060	perturb the electrical network
1843060	1846140	and you can get flat heads like a Pifelina,
1846140	1848980	you can get round heads like an S-Mediterranean,
1848980	1850780	or you can get your normal triangular heads.
1850780	1852860	And not only do you get the head shape,
1852860	1855500	but actually the brain shape changes
1855500	1857180	in the distribution of stem cells
1857180	1859820	becomes just like these other species
1859820	1862580	because the space of possible outcomes
1862580	1865140	of this electrical circuit contains attractors
1865140	1867480	that correspond to other species
1867480	1869780	that evolution has found in the past, okay?
1869780	1872740	And you can dial in those without any changes
1872740	1874140	to the genomics, so both in here
1874140	1876060	and in the two-headed animals I showed you,
1876060	1877100	there's nothing wrong with the genome.
1877100	1878980	The genetics are completely wild type.
1878980	1881060	This is modifying the information
1881060	1883380	stored in the electrical network
1883380	1886140	and you can access other attractors
1886140	1887580	that belong to other species
1887580	1890860	with the exact same genetically normal cells.
1890860	1893140	And in fact, you can access regions of that state space
1893140	1895720	that evolution doesn't use because they're not viable.
1895720	1897580	You can take flat planaria and turn them
1897580	1899500	into these weird spiky forms.
1899500	1902340	You can make these three-dimensional things
1902340	1903740	that look like hats.
1903740	1906180	You can make this kind of thing,
1906180	1907700	which are sort of combinations.
1907700	1909780	The flatworms don't even need to be flat anymore.
1909780	1913980	And so the idea here is that you can really have
1913980	1916340	drastic control over large-scale anatomy
1916340	1919700	given the same genome because what the genome builds
1919700	1923420	is cellular collectives that use electricity
1923420	1928420	to store their set points, their target morphologies.
1928740	1931060	And this should sound like a very familiar story
1931780	1933660	for neuroscientists because that's exactly
1933660	1935260	how brains work.
1935260	1939980	So getting to the sort of applied regenerative medicine side
1939980	1942580	of this, unlike salamanders, frogs
1942580	1944780	do not regenerate their legs.
1944780	1947780	And what we've done is we've taken froglets
1947780	1949300	and we've designed, we've used this information
1949300	1952340	to design a cocktail of drugs
1952340	1954420	that change the electrical state of the wound.
1954420	1955900	And you can see here normally in the frog,
1955900	1957900	you amputate the leg and there's basically nothing
1958180	1960020	in 45 days.
1960020	1963500	We add the cocktail, the application's actually
1963500	1967420	just for 48 hours, sorry, 24 hours, so one day.
1967420	1969140	And after that one day exposure,
1969140	1970820	it kick starts the whole cascade.
1970820	1972980	So here pro regenerative genes become turned on.
1972980	1974420	So this is MSX1.
1974420	1977060	And then immediately you start growing this leg.
1977060	1978900	By 45 days later, you've got some toes,
1978900	1981580	you've got a toenail, eventually a very nice leg.
1981580	1983700	And you can see that the leg is
1983700	1985900	both touch sensitive and motile.
1985900	1989940	So what you can do is override the normal program
1989940	1992100	of growth, which is normally very little,
1992100	1995220	and give the whole thing of a simple signal
1995220	1998740	over 24 hours that then is picked up
1998740	2001020	by all the transcriptional cascades and everything else
2001020	2002300	that will work over months.
2002300	2005300	In fact, our latest paper, 13 months of leg growth
2005300	2007540	following one day treatment.
2008740	2011220	And so we've looked at this in,
2011220	2012300	so these are frogs and worms,
2012300	2014540	we've looked at this in human mesenchymal stem cells
2014540	2016100	and cardiomyocytes and so on.
2016100	2018820	And it's very highly conserved.
2018820	2021740	It works throughout the tree of life.
2021740	2023620	We know it's relevant to humans
2023620	2025420	because of human channelopathies.
2025420	2028460	So lots of human ion channel mutations give rise
2028460	2029980	to different kinds of birth defects,
2029980	2032140	telling us that even in humans,
2032140	2034700	these electrical properties are very important
2034700	2036980	for setting correct morphologies.
2036980	2037820	And so what we do now,
2037820	2040220	and so this is our company with David Kaplan,
2041060	2045900	we have a company that's focused on David's lab
2045900	2047340	builds these bioreactors,
2047340	2052340	which basically deliver cocktails of ion channel drugs
2052380	2056260	that are picked by us to induce pro-regenerative states.
2056260	2058660	And we are now having more or less solved it in frog.
2058660	2061860	We are now in mammals, we're doing this in mice.
2061860	2065540	And then hopefully someday hopefully humans, of course.
2065540	2068900	So just to start wrapping up here,
2068940	2070460	the point of all of this is that
2070460	2073060	we now are starting to understand the circuits
2073060	2075660	to the point where we can make multi-scale models.
2075660	2077700	So we start with knowing what genes are there
2077700	2080140	to produce various types of ion channels,
2080140	2081660	but these ion channels open and close.
2081660	2083020	So simply knowing the genes
2083020	2085220	doesn't tell you what the electrical states are going to be.
2085220	2087860	You have to simulate the physiological tissues
2087860	2090180	and those give rise to larger organ structures.
2090180	2093260	And eventually you can get down to algorithmic types
2093260	2096340	of control that show you how the electrical activity
2096340	2098420	in these tissues makes decisions
2098420	2100020	about what's going to go where.
2100020	2103300	So you go from the genomically specified hardware
2103300	2106700	to the low level and then the higher level software
2106700	2110180	that allows these cells to make the kinds of decisions
2110180	2114420	to robustly create and repair complex morphologies, okay?
2114420	2116060	And so in that process, of course,
2116060	2119220	there's a huge opportunity for application
2119220	2120060	for machine learning.
2120060	2121060	And so we've done some of this,
2121060	2124700	use machine learning to both discover the electrical circuits
2124700	2126580	and to discover the modulations
2126580	2129940	that are needed to use these therapeutically.
2129940	2131380	And just as a very simple,
2131380	2133140	I'll just close up here with a couple of slides
2133140	2134940	to show you a very simple example.
2134940	2138660	This is what a normal tadpole brain looks like.
2138660	2141140	And if you perturb it with a mutation,
2141140	2143300	let's say in a really important gene like notch,
2143300	2145100	which basically the forebrain is gone,
2145100	2147100	the midbrain is a bubble,
2147100	2149020	the hindbrain is also a bubble,
2149020	2151260	it's just they have no behavior that's laid there.
2151260	2153540	And what you can do is create a model
2153540	2156780	with the bioelectric circuit that determines brain shape
2156780	2159300	and ask it in under circumstances like this,
2159300	2160860	that either there's a mutation
2160860	2163380	or they've been hit by alcohol or nicotine
2163380	2164740	or some other kind of poison,
2166860	2168340	what would you have to change?
2168340	2169820	Which channels would you open and close
2169820	2172500	to get back to this correct bioelectric pattern
2172500	2175060	that is responsible for a normal brain?
2175060	2177380	And so the model is actually now sufficiently detailed
2177380	2180140	that it can actually tell us what channel is
2180140	2182060	and using that we can pick drugs.
2182060	2186460	So known ion channel drugs and when you do this,
2186460	2189380	you get back the correct brain shape,
2189380	2192900	the correct brain size and you get their behavior,
2192900	2193820	you get their IQs back,
2193820	2195660	so their learning rates are back to normal,
2195660	2199380	despite the fact that they've had really debilitating mutations
2199380	2202220	or exposure to teratogens like nicotine or alcohol
2202220	2203340	and so on.
2203340	2205780	Okay, so this is an example of starting off
2205780	2208780	with a basic understanding of bioelectric circuits
2208780	2211580	and how they work to a computational model
2211580	2213780	that actually helps you design therapeutics
2213780	2215940	to fix a rather complex outcome,
2215940	2217700	which is brain development.
2217700	2219380	Okay, and so what we are doing now
2219380	2222620	is we're trying to create a complete pipeline
2222620	2225740	where you start off with existing information
2225740	2228660	on what ion channels are in your tissue of interest,
2228660	2230700	what bioelectrical state do you want
2230700	2233100	and then use the model and the simulations
2233100	2237020	to tell you what channel openers and blockers do you need,
2237020	2239540	something like 20% of all drugs are ion channel drugs.
2239540	2243260	So there's this huge toolkit that we call electroseuticals,
2243260	2247060	which with the correct computational simulations,
2247060	2251180	you can actually start to deploy outside of things
2251180	2253660	like cardiac arrhythmia as an epilepsy,
2253660	2255860	as all those drugs can be repurposed now
2255860	2258020	for regenerative medicine.
2258020	2260340	And so this is an example of our software,
2260340	2263100	you can all play with it.
2263100	2265020	It's online and the idea is that you would pick
2265020	2267980	the tissues you want and it would actually help you
2268980	2271380	pick the correct drugs.
2271380	2275580	So I'll just close here and just summarize what I've told you
2275580	2277980	is that there's this incredibly powerful
2277980	2280100	physiological software layer
2280100	2282660	that sits between the genotype and the anatomy.
2282660	2284380	And it's a really trackable target
2284380	2286380	for regenerative biomedicine.
2286380	2288020	Evolution discovered very early
2288020	2291020	that electrical signaling is a really convenient medium
2291020	2293700	for computation and global decision-making.
2293700	2295100	And this is why brains exploit it,
2295100	2297140	this is why our computer technology exploits it
2297180	2300300	and this is why morphogenesis runs on the system.
2300300	2303220	Cracking this code, you can really give us the opportunity
2303220	2306300	to rewrite the pattern memories
2306300	2310700	that allow us to control large-scale shape.
2310700	2311820	And when I say pattern memories,
2311820	2314420	I mean, these are literally those two-headed worms
2314420	2316700	that I showed you, if you now cut them into pieces
2316700	2318820	with no more manipulation of any kind,
2318820	2320660	they continue to make two-headed animals,
2320660	2322860	even though their genomes are wild type, okay?
2322860	2326780	This is that memory, that electrical circuit
2326780	2329380	really keeps the memory and so you can set it back
2329380	2331380	to being one-headed, but until you do that,
2331380	2334580	the pieces will continue to make two-headed worms, okay?
2334580	2337100	And so new artificial intelligence tools
2337100	2339420	are now coming online to help us design
2339420	2340340	these kinds of strategies.
2340340	2343900	So it's now rational design to address birth defects,
2343900	2345660	cancer and regeneration.
2345660	2347380	And also our latest work has been
2347380	2350060	on making synthetic living organisms.
2350060	2353380	So with that, I'd like to thank the people
2353380	2355780	who contributed to all this work,
2355780	2360140	our funders, and I'll thank all of you for listening.
2360140	2362940	And if we could take a five-minute break
2362940	2365300	and then I'll come back and I'm happy to answer
2365300	2366220	any questions.
2367100	2368460	Wow, that was a lot.
2368460	2369900	I think we do need a break.
2369900	2372740	We will let you go for now and have you back in five minutes.
2372740	2374420	Thank you so, so much already.
2374420	2375860	And there's lots of questions in the chat,
2375860	2378340	but I will moderate them and we'll see you in a bit.
2378340	2379860	Perfect, five minutes.
2379860	2381180	Okay, sounds great.
2381180	2382300	Okay, lovely.
2382300	2385180	Well, that was quite a lot to digest.
2385180	2386820	I'll keep the questions coming and also
2386820	2389380	upvote the ones that you want to push forward.
2389380	2392420	He already agreed that he can stay on for half an hour,
2392420	2393580	up to half an hour longer.
2393580	2396620	So for those of you who want to learn more about this,
2396620	2397900	feel free to join longer.
2397900	2401060	For now, we have lots of exciting community updates,
2401060	2403580	lots of exciting projects and events
2403580	2405660	and fellowships and hackathons and so forth
2405660	2406620	in the community.
2406620	2408660	We will start with Elena.
2408660	2410380	Elena, if you're here, feel free to unmute
2410380	2413300	and tell us about your upcoming conference.
2414300	2416540	Yeah, hello everyone.
2416540	2420660	Very nice to see a lot of useful developments in the field
2420660	2421980	and hear all those awesome talks.
2421980	2424020	I'm actually a very big fan of this group,
2424020	2426420	even though not always can I attend.
2426420	2429980	Anyways, I just wanted to let you know that soon
2429980	2433780	we're going to have our fourth annual conference
2433780	2437100	and in Agile of the Diseases 2021.
2437100	2440020	It's going to take place virtually this year again
2440020	2442100	because we're not so sure that it's safe
2442540	2444620	for all of us together.
2444620	2447340	We hope that it will change in the next years, of course.
2447340	2451660	So the conference is going to take place on August 1922
2451660	2454980	and in the Eastern time zone.
2454980	2457500	So we will focus on the four traditional topics,
2457500	2460220	which will be the mechanisms of aging,
2460220	2463820	the human trials of rejuvenation by technology therapies,
2463820	2465180	the biomarkers of aging,
2465180	2467300	and of course traditionally investment matters
2467300	2468580	and regulatory matters.
2469580	2473980	As usual, we have a number of prominent researchers
2473980	2474940	giving their talks.
2474940	2477700	Some of the information is going to be pretty fresh
2477700	2478580	just from the lab.
2478580	2481380	So I hope that you will have a look
2481380	2482980	at the program of the conference
2482980	2487180	and probably get inspired and come join us this year.

2522660	2524300	Oh, can you hear me?
2524300	2525140	Yes.
2525140	2527300	Wow, lovely background.
2527300	2528140	Thank you.
2528140	2529300	It's Idaho.
2529300	2530140	Yeah.
2530140	2530980	Thanks, Alison.
2530980	2535980	And great to meet you all on this regular meetings
2535980	2537940	that are really great and informative.
2539140	2540580	Some of you might know me.
2540580	2542980	And so I work with Ranjan.
2542980	2545260	Ranjan is the founder of R42 Group.
2545260	2548620	We are a fund and also investing in AI and longevity
2548620	2550540	and also an institute.
2550540	2554060	Part of our institute that we have is Fellowship.
2554060	2555300	So it's AI Fellowship.
2555300	2557660	And we're now in our cohort four.
2557660	2560180	And our demo day is actually tomorrow
2560180	2563300	between 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. noon Pacific.
2563300	2565660	Some really great projects.
2565660	2568020	Students from all over the world were working
2568020	2570340	on these projects over the 12 week period.
2570340	2574420	So they include mathematics, adventure capital,
2574420	2576100	no code, machine learning platform
2576100	2580860	for biomedical researchers, cancer biology,
2580860	2584420	just kind of a wide range of really exciting projects.
2584420	2586220	So you're all welcome to come.
2586220	2588180	And I'll send you the schedule
2588180	2590740	and also the registration link in the chat,
2590740	2594060	as well as, yeah, feel free to pop in and out
2594060	2595740	and come for all our new presentations.
2595740	2597300	So, yeah, great.
2598500	2599340	And yes.
2599340	2600420	Thank you.
2600420	2602660	Here, you might add a few words.
2605180	2607060	Let us know in case you wanna do so, Ranjan.
2607060	2608780	Otherwise, we look forward to-
2608780	2609740	Yes, that's okay.
2609740	2610580	It's free.
2610580	2611420	I'll just add it's free.
2612220	2616380	And we're gonna have the first holographic telephone call
2616380	2619940	tomorrow between England and Silicon Valley.
2619940	2623260	So that'll be around about 11 a.m. Pacific.
2623260	2624100	Exciting stuff.
2624100	2625860	You're taking the A.I. theme very meta.
2625860	2627020	Okay, lovely.
2627020	2628580	Next one up, we have Dima.
2630100	2631540	Yeah, hi, everyone.
2631540	2634460	So we're organizing a longevity hackathon.
2634460	2637020	So it's a 48 hour event
2637020	2640420	to bring the ideas to fruition in longevity
2640420	2643340	and the ideas to bring together longevity researchers,
2643340	2647660	developers, A.I. scientists, entrepreneurs,
2647660	2649780	attract people from outside the field as well,
2649780	2652660	help them build teams and tackle the kind of
2652660	2654620	like long hanging fruits that you can actually,
2654620	2657460	or you can actually produce innovation over just 48 hours.
2657460	2661140	So if there's topics from biotech, A.I., pharma,
2661140	2663700	we already have people from all continents,
2663700	2666500	except perhaps like Antarctica and Australia,
2666500	2669460	but like there's people joining from all over the world.
2669460	2671660	There's longevity tech funds.
2671660	2675820	We'll invest 100K into the winning teams.
2675820	2678540	So I'm also confident that this will continue afterwards.
2678540	2680620	And then Forsyte Institute is also supporting
2680620	2683460	with the fellowship for 2022.
2683460	2685580	So yeah, please join.
2685580	2687980	We're still looking for sponsors and mentors
2687980	2688820	filled with each other.
2688820	2692260	And I'm gonna drop it in chat as well.
2692260	2694020	The information about it.
2694020	2694860	Thank you.
2694860	2695940	Okay, I have one more to go,
2695940	2698500	which is the Aging Research and Drug Development Conference
2698540	2701660	in Copenhagen on August 31st to September 3rd.
2701660	2702980	I'll drop a link to that.
2702980	2704260	And as you can tell,
2704260	2706140	there's lots of exciting stuff happening.
2706140	2710660	Nathan, I think is on the call for the fellowship.
2710660	2711620	I reached out to you earlier,
2711620	2713700	if you wanna say something to your feet to do so now,
2713700	2714700	or in the chat.
2716540	2719580	Otherwise, I think we have Michael back.
2719580	2721420	Okay, Michael, are you back?
2721420	2722260	I'm back.
2722260	2723380	Okay, lovely.
2723380	2724300	Okay, great.
2724460	2729260	I think let's do maybe a few questions on the record.
2729260	2731700	And if anyone prefers to have theirs off the record,
2731700	2733980	then I'll turn the recording off for that.
2733980	2735540	I think some people just prefer that
2735540	2737660	for a more open discussion.
2737660	2739980	But the first one that got uploaded a bunch is Carl.
2739980	2741660	Carl asked, I think three questions
2741660	2743220	so you can make your pick now.
2743220	2744420	No pressure on you.
2744420	2745420	This is totally good.
2745420	2747300	These are good questions to be on the record
2747300	2749420	because well, I mean, first of all,
2749420	2750540	just let me say kudos.
2750540	2753260	This is very awesome sounding stuff
2753260	2755860	and kind of blows me away a little bit.
2755860	2759980	So before getting into aging and regenerative medicine
2759980	2763260	even just more basic back,
2763260	2765300	I have loads of more basic background questions
2765300	2766980	about these bioelectric networks.
2766980	2768420	So the meta question in,
2768420	2770180	I'll just give two example questions.
2770180	2775180	The meta question that the myriad of questions raises
2775780	2779660	is what's the best modern review or textbook
2779660	2782060	that introduces all those people who don't know anything
2782060	2783700	about these bioelectric networks to that.
2783700	2787620	But so the two example questions I had right away were,
2787620	2789940	what is the down, you know, what is within a cell,
2789940	2794220	what is the pathway for this bioelectrics
2794220	2797740	to actually control gene expression, right?
2797740	2800540	So what's going on in the cell that way?
2800540	2802660	How does it work epigenetically?
2802660	2805900	And then the other question I wrote was,
2806420	2811420	in non-regenerative species after development,
2812220	2814780	what do these bioelectric networks do with anything?
2814780	2816180	Yeah, yeah, great.
2816180	2817660	Okay, three questions.
2817660	2820060	Let's see, as far as reviews.
2820060	2823500	So I have lots, I've written lots.
2823500	2825340	A couple of other people have written some good ones.
2825340	2827740	Anybody who's interested, please email me.
2827740	2830100	Or if you guys have some sort of a form
2830100	2831860	that I can post this at, I will post.
2831860	2834780	If you just tell Alison later offline, she can forward it.
2834780	2835620	Sure, yeah, I will.
2836140	2839660	Yeah, we've written tons of very basic reviews
2839660	2841260	on this stuff, taking you from zero
2841260	2842700	all the way to what's known today.
2842700	2847700	Okay, the second question is a transduction to gene expression.
2848380	2853380	So on the single cell level,
2854140	2856500	we know there are about half a dozen ways
2856500	2860780	in which voltage change regulates downstream gene expression.
2860780	2862940	So this includes things that you're familiar with,
2862940	2864020	the neuroscience, for example,
2864020	2865620	voltage-gated calcium signals
2865620	2867500	followed by calcium transduction.
2867500	2870780	This includes control of neurotransmitter movement
2870780	2873340	like serotonin between cells through gap junctions
2873340	2875660	or through the serotonin transporter.
2875660	2877500	And this includes some more exotic things
2877500	2879500	like voltage-sensitive phosphatases.
2879500	2882580	It includes things like voltage-gated butyrate transporters
2882580	2885420	that then hit HDAC and those kind of
2885420	2888020	epichromatin modification pathways.
2888020	2889420	All of that is known.
2889420	2894420	I should say, though, that it's highly unsatisfying
2895900	2897740	because what that, I mean, it's good information,
2897740	2898700	it's good to have that.
2898700	2902260	The problem is all of that is single cell level data.
2902260	2905020	And if you want to know why your hand
2905020	2906420	doesn't look like your foot,
2906420	2909180	it's good to know the transduction on the single cell level,
2909180	2913380	but you still have to ask about global dynamics
2913380	2915580	that determine the size and the shape and the scaling.
2915580	2917220	It's not enough to know what the transduction
2917220	2918980	looks like on the single cell.
2918980	2921820	And what's the, oh, what's it doing in adults?
2921820	2926100	I think what it's doing in adults is morphostasis.
2926100	2927700	So it's keeping you together
2927700	2931940	against individual cell senescence and turnover.
2931940	2935260	So usually what it's, and by the way,
2935260	2937780	the interface between bioelectricity and aging
2937780	2939140	is not well understood at all.
2939140	2940340	No one has studied it, right?
2940340	2941700	We haven't even touched it.
2941700	2943580	So it's not as if we know what the answer is,
2943580	2946540	but basically I think probably what it's doing
2946540	2950340	is it's just cancer suppression and morphostasis
2950340	2951940	and keeping your tissues together.
2951940	2954340	And it's really activating those very dynamic
2955340	2957620	morphogenetic rearrangement modules
2957620	2960020	that is needed to really sort of rejuvenate
2960020	2961380	and restore after injury.
2964860	2965820	Are you satisfied?
2965820	2966780	Okay, lovely.
2966780	2968780	Glad you snuck three questions and Carl.
2968780	2970580	Okay, next one up, we have one out.
2976700	2977540	You do?
2977540	2978380	Okay.
2980620	2981460	Fascinating stuff.
2981460	2984340	So what is the, what controls the appearance
2984340	2986900	of these electrical zones?
2986900	2990100	What determines their dispersal as well?
2991300	2996300	Yeah, so there's two important pieces to this.
2996660	2999500	One important piece is what underlies the hardware itself.
2999500	3000620	And so you have to ask,
3000620	3002980	in order to have any kind of electrical states,
3002980	3005660	you have to have the correct ion channels
3005700	3007380	that are capable of producing them.
3007380	3009980	So one thing that you need to understand
3009980	3012100	is what channels are there and what are their properties?
3012100	3014660	So for example, they might themselves be voltage sensitive
3014660	3016300	or they might be pH gated or whatever,
3016300	3021060	and this controls the properties of these channels
3021060	3026060	are the excitable medium on which these electrical phenomena
3028060	3028900	propagate.
3028900	3031140	Now the specific patterns,
3031140	3034140	let's say that electric face pattern is,
3034140	3036340	it's an emergent pattern in the same way
3036340	3041340	that Turing patterns emerge from an excitable chemical medium
3041460	3045220	or the way that when we talk about this with my students,
3045220	3047180	I start off and I say visualize,
3047180	3049020	you have a collection of electric parts
3049020	3052140	that make a calculator and when you turn it on,
3052140	3053780	it has a default behavior, right?
3053780	3055860	That the parts were chosen
3055860	3058820	so that when a juice is turned on and the thing is running,
3058820	3063820	it will by default start off at a consistent baseline
3064340	3065740	emergent state, which is zero.
3065740	3068220	Now, past that, it has interesting properties
3068220	3072060	of reprogrammability and all kinds of other things it can do,
3072060	3074980	but there's this basic state that the parts
3074980	3076460	which are shaped by evolution,
3077700	3079060	there's an emergent pattern
3079060	3080780	and we can study that symmetry breaking.
3080780	3082220	So it's a process of symmetry breaking
3082220	3084940	of amplification of long range inhibition,
3084940	3087180	short range activation that sets up,
3087180	3089220	it sets up exactly two eye spots
3089220	3091060	at a particular distance apart.
3091060	3092960	All of these things can be modeled.
3095140	3096860	Okay.
3096860	3098300	Are you satisfied, Donald?
3098300	3099660	Yes, okay, great.
3099660	3101220	We'll do it.
3101220	3102380	Lovely, great.
3102380	3103620	Next up, we have Josh.
3106380	3107940	Hey, thanks again for the talk.
3107940	3109940	That was like super interesting.
3109940	3112980	My question was for the worms to put planaria,
3112980	3115140	is that how you pronounce it?
3115140	3116660	If you chop, you mentioned that they could have
3116660	3118380	like learned behaviors.
3118380	3120060	I was curious if like the worms chopped
3120060	3122740	with multiple pieces, once those pieces grow,
3122740	3125580	if all the pieces retain those learned behaviors
3125580	3127140	of like the original worm?
3127140	3128780	Yeah, that's a great question.
3128780	3132020	It was addressed first in the 60s by a guy named McConnell
3132020	3135620	and he published his observations that in fact they do.
3135620	3138060	So you can take a worm and you can train
3138060	3140300	on a particular task, chop off the tail,
3140300	3142060	raise a new worm from that tail.
3142060	3147060	So we in 2013, we reproduced all that aspect
3147420	3148380	of his work, he did other stuff,
3148380	3150900	but that's what we reproduced and it's true, they do.
3150900	3153100	So what that's telling you is that
3153100	3156380	even learned sort of behavioral information,
3156380	3158100	not just morphological information,
3158100	3162980	is stored outside the brain in some form
3162980	3166260	and is able to be imprinted on the new brain as it forms.
3166260	3167100	It's pretty remarkable
3167100	3168260	because that tail doesn't do anything
3168260	3169420	until the new brain forms, right?
3169420	3170540	So it grows a new brain
3170540	3172700	and then the information is somehow imprinted.
3172700	3174980	So what you're seeing is learned information
3174980	3176340	moving around within the body.
3176340	3179060	Super interesting, not well understood at all.
3179060	3180700	Cool.
3180700	3183620	Wow, okay, Ashish is next.
3185060	3186780	Hi, Michael, very nice talk.
3186780	3187620	Thank you.
3187620	3190020	I wanted to ask which intervention tools
3190020	3192820	are available right now for mainly
3192820	3194740	for the regenerative medicine purposes?
3194740	3196700	Is it mainly ion channel genes
3196700	3199620	or something else also available?
3199620	3203540	Yeah, the tools, I mean, as I see it,
3203540	3205820	the best tools are the ion channel drugs.
3205820	3208300	I mean, in model systems at the bench,
3208300	3212380	ion channel genes are useful
3212380	3213820	because they give you the cleanest,
3213820	3214980	the genetic technologies,
3214980	3217260	like the cleanest for getting pathway information.
3217260	3219540	But I think in medical application,
3219540	3221540	you don't want to have to do gene therapy
3221540	3224780	every time you want to target these pathways
3224780	3225740	and you don't have to
3225740	3227780	because I think we've had great success
3227780	3231500	using drugs together with the computational model.
3231500	3232860	That's the key, you need both.
3232860	3235660	You need the available toolkit of drugs
3235660	3237900	that target all of these ion channels.
3237900	3239500	And then you need the computational model
3239500	3241700	to tell you which channels to turn on and off
3241700	3244140	and when to get the correct outcome.
3244140	3246540	And so I see that as the most important tool to get right now.
3246540	3248820	It's the collection of channel drugs.
3248820	3250380	All right, thank you very much.
3251860	3254820	Lovely, we have Martin next.
3254820	3257700	Hi, is there a relationship
3257700	3262540	between endogenous peptide-based ionophores
3262540	3264460	and the ionophores you're using?
3265460	3269700	We have used, so the vast majority of our work
3269700	3270900	is not with ionophores.
3270900	3272660	We've done a little bit with ionophores.
3272660	3275660	The main ionophore we've used is monensin
3275660	3278420	and we've also used a couple other things.
3278420	3280380	But I'm sure there are others.
3280380	3283060	I mean, I don't know about the peptide-based ones.
3283060	3285340	So maybe we should have a conversation offline
3285340	3287540	so that I could learn more about them.
3287540	3290340	But we've used things like monensin basically.
3291420	3293980	Yeah, but the majority of things we use are not,
3293980	3296220	the ionophores are really kind of a sledgehammer
3296220	3297260	in many ways.
3297260	3300540	We tend to use very specific ion channel drugs
3300540	3303500	that hit classes of different kinds of channels.
3304820	3305660	Thank you.
3306660	3309500	Thanks, next one up we have Alan.
3321620	3323220	I can also ask you a question
3323260	3324940	in case you're talking about muting.
3324940	3328580	She's just asking, what is the cocktail that includes DPCA?
3329500	3332140	Is this Ellen Heberkatz, is that right?
3332140	3335900	Oh, hey, Ellen, it's been a while, I have a long time no see.
3335900	3339860	Yeah, so there's a variety of cocktails.
3339860	3342660	The earliest cocktail wasn't even a cocktail,
3342660	3343900	it was extremely simple.
3343900	3346820	It was just monensin.
3346820	3350860	We had one after that that had progesterone
3350860	3352380	and things like that.
3352380	3356580	We are playing with DPCA, stay tuned.
3357780	3358980	Among many other things,
3358980	3362300	the current cocktail has five different ingredients
3362300	3365540	and that paper should be out in a matter of weeks.
3365540	3367100	So you'll see the cocktail,
3367100	3369740	you'll see all the dosages and everything else.
3371900	3373980	Okay, lovely, next one up, Anton.
3375460	3380460	Hello, so I was really impressed by your in vivo results
3381460	3384820	with fog limber generation,
3384820	3389660	but I actually have a question regarding in vitro application,
3389660	3394660	like can your drug cocktails and similar interventions
3395500	3398740	be used for suspension culture
3398740	3402100	to grow some vascularized organoids
3402100	3407100	or some vascularized muscle tissues for clean meat application
3407500	3412500	or for in vitro we have to do something quite different?
3414140	3415380	Yeah, great question.
3415380	3417540	So I think absolutely they can.
3417540	3419740	We've not done that particular thing.
3419740	3422660	What we have done with David Kaplan's group
3422660	3426820	and some others is we've done in vitro with cell culture.
3426820	3430540	So mammalian human cell culture, it absolutely works.
3430540	3432940	So you can keep stem cells more stem-like,
3432940	3435260	you can force stem cells to differentiate.
3435260	3436500	You can do those kinds of things
3436540	3438620	exactly the same methods.
3438620	3442620	I think absolutely they would work in organoids.
3442620	3446780	We are currently using them in our synthetic bio-bots
3446780	3449940	which are sort of, it's like organoids one step further
3449940	3452180	which they have organoids with behavior.
3452180	3454020	So they move around, they do various things
3454020	3455660	and that's what we're doing.
3455660	3458820	But I would love to, if that's something you work on,
3458820	3460420	drop me an email and let's talk about it
3460420	3463500	because yeah, that's an open area of application
3463500	3465700	that just nobody's gotten to it yet.
3465700	3468540	Oh yeah, we work a bit, I will drop an email.
3468540	3470420	Sure, drop me an email, yeah.
3470420	3471740	Thank you.
3471740	3473260	Vadim is up next.
3474940	3476260	Thank you.
3476260	3479260	Yeah, the answer to my question probably is not known
3479260	3482700	but Michael, based on what, I mean,
3482700	3485580	based on your understanding of the regeneration process
3485580	3487460	in your systems, what do you think
3488340	3491500	would be a biological age of the regenerated tissues?
3491500	3493140	Would it be younger or the same age
3493140	3495780	of the rest of the animal will be older?
3495780	3497020	Great question.
3497020	3498260	I don't know the answer to that.
3498260	3500220	We have been working with,
3502380	3507060	so Steve Hoverarth is making this methylation clock
3507060	3509540	for various organisms and we're waiting
3509540	3513460	till he calibrates the frog one and then we can see.
3514980	3516980	That would be the easiest way to do it right now.
3516980	3518780	If you have some other markers,
3518780	3520900	I'd love to hear about it but we don't know.
3520900	3522420	Actually, we are doing this together
3522500	3523820	and we're waiting for this him for the frog.
3523820	3524660	Oh, well, there you go.
3524660	3525500	I said, okay, great.
3525500	3528220	So, okay, so we'll, you know, as soon as you guys are ready,
3528220	3530460	we'll, we can check it out.
3530460	3535460	And maybe, you know, once we get the mice working,
3536220	3538900	then we can check, I mean, that should be much easier.
3538900	3540340	Once we get the mice working,
3540340	3543060	we can see what the mouse tissues look like.
3543060	3544660	That stuff is still in progress.
3545940	3547220	Fantastic, okay.
3547220	3549180	Then next one up, let's take one
3549180	3551460	who hasn't asked the question, Thomas Schwirder.
3552780	3555140	Yeah, hi, fantastic talk.
3555140	3557860	So I have a question basically about an example
3557860	3559100	that you mentioned sort of in passing,
3559100	3564100	which is the fact that in like deer antlers grow at rates
3564540	3566540	on the order of centimeters per day.
3566540	3568420	Now, you mentioned in the flatworms
3568420	3570340	that you were able to sort of activate
3572740	3576260	processes that happen in certain species
3576260	3578580	in flatworms that are of other species.
3578580	3580660	And what I'm wondering is whether you think
3580660	3583020	it might be possible to use bioelectrical signaling
3583020	3587140	to trigger bone regrowth on that same sort of order.
3589060	3591260	Yeah, in kind of the same way.
3591260	3594660	Yeah, I mean, optimistically, I think so.
3594660	3596260	I, you know, it's entirely possible
3596260	3599980	that we will run into some weird aspect of deer physiology
3599980	3602100	that permits it, whereas for humans, it wouldn't work.
3602100	3603740	I can't say that that doesn't exist.
3603740	3605700	We don't know, but I don't think so.
3605700	3610500	I think that, I think these are all very fundamental things
3610500	3613020	and I can tell you some speculative stories
3613020	3615980	about why I think humans normally don't do this kind of stuff.
3615980	3617940	But I think it's there to be unlocked.
3617940	3620980	I doubt it's gonna be a deer-specific issue, yeah.
3622300	3623140	Thank you.
3623140	3624620	Oh, lots of work to be done.
3624620	3625700	Brad English.
3627860	3630780	Yeah, you mentioned me.
3633500	3634700	Sorry, you're breaking up.
3634700	3635540	I can't hear.
3636380	3638140	General pathways that you,
3638140	3640340	maybe someone else can ask about the internet issue for me.
3640340	3641940	My question's in the chat.
3641940	3645500	Okay, have you tried sitting a plate of cells
3645500	3648220	atop a conductive plate with a certain pattern
3648220	3650780	to see if you could guide its development?
3650780	3652500	Sorry, what do you mean by a conductive,
3652500	3654260	but what's a conductive plate?
3654260	3657660	Like with a voltage or current running through it to change,
3657660	3661620	what would, yeah, the underlying firmware.
3661620	3662940	Yeah, got it, got it.
3662940	3665940	You can, okay, so generally speaking,
3666940	3670540	using external electrical signals,
3670540	3673500	like using electrodes basically,
3673500	3677060	is you can do certain things that way.
3677060	3678260	So one thing you can do that way
3678260	3682060	is provide a vector for cell migration.
3682060	3682900	So that's an easy way.
3682900	3684460	If you have migratory cell types,
3684460	3686540	that is a great way to get them all moving
3686540	3688220	in one particular direction.
3688220	3692140	What's very hard using external electrodes
3692260	3696020	is to set up standing patterns of voltage across tissue,
3696020	3698460	which is what the encoding really is.
3698460	3701620	The bioelectrical code is really spatial patterns
3701620	3704700	of voltage differences across a field of cells.
3704700	3708100	That's actually very difficult to do with electrodes.
3708100	3710660	But if you want to do things like move cells around,
3710660	3714420	that you can do with external currents.
3714420	3716220	Okay, so you might have to go as small
3716220	3718340	as like magnetic nanoparticles or something,
3718340	3721100	folding around to produce something more interesting
3721460	3722540	or sit with the chemicals.
3722540	3724060	But yeah, I see your point and you're right.
3724060	3725860	It's a mesoscopic at that point.
3725860	3728460	Yeah, I mean, but the tools are already here.
3728460	3731340	So I mean, if we want to set up a pattern
3731340	3734860	that encodes the correct size and shape of the brain,
3734860	3736340	which is not a simple pattern,
3736340	3739060	we can already do that with drugs.
3739060	3740820	And if you want a more complex pattern,
3740820	3742780	I think what you would do is optogenetics.
3742780	3745100	So you would lay down a light mask
3745100	3747060	that had the exact shape that you want
3747060	3749460	and your tissue would have on our channel eruptions
3749460	3750300	or something like that.
3750380	3754860	And we've done that for kickstarting tail regeneration
3754860	3755700	and things like that.
3755700	3759820	I think right now, that's the easier path for this.
3760700	3762100	Fascinating, thank you so much, Michael.
3762100	3763260	Bleeding edge stuff.
3763260	3764600	Cool, thanks.
3764600	3766500	We have Artem and then Carl.
3769860	3770700	Hi there.
3771860	3776660	Just earlier to Ashish and the Brett's question just now,
3776660	3781260	I think more operational than a senescence question,
3781260	3785740	but yeah, is there anything you think
3785740	3790740	that could be brought from a computer science background
3791060	3796060	from adjacent fields like microscopy or NGS sequencing
3798220	3801020	to enrich the stool kit that you mentioned,
3801940	3806940	both using the drugs to alter the ion channels
3807140	3812140	and to get access to more of the morphospace, let's say.
3813580	3815500	Sure, yeah, absolutely.
3815500	3819140	I mean, on the microscopy and better dyes
3819140	3821940	and better imaging of bioelectric states
3821940	3824460	in under various conditions is really important.
3824460	3827180	So nobody's done the basic profiling.
3827180	3828620	So like physiomic profiling
3828620	3832460	I'm asking every normal organ in its normal structure,
3832460	3834740	what is the bioelectric map, right?
3834740	3835580	No one's done that.
3835580	3837660	I mean, we've done it in very specific cases
3837660	3839620	for some frogs and worms and things like this,
3839620	3842660	but in general, that data is extremely sparse.
3842660	3846860	So lots more imaging using better dyes
3846860	3847940	that need to be developed
3848940	3851760	and just getting those physiomic data sets
3851760	3854100	to complement the transcriptomic
3854100	3856900	and the genomic data sets is critical.
3856900	3858780	For NGS, yeah, NGS is good.
3858780	3862540	I feel like we already have most of the NGS that we need
3862540	3865260	because almost any tissue, what do we wanna know?
3865260	3866580	We wanna know which channels are there
3866580	3868140	because those are our control knobs.
3868140	3871340	So pretty much any tissue you can go online
3871340	3874020	and you can download somebody's profiling
3874020	3876580	and you can figure out what channels are there.
3876580	3879180	So that's probably not the rate limiting step
3879180	3881020	but the microscopy for sure, yeah.
3882700	3885140	Wow, okay, now Carl, you go again.
3886140	3890100	So outside of the sort of translational aspect here
3890100	3892380	of getting things to regenerate
3892380	3894980	or fixing problems in the process,
3894980	3899100	how many labs in the world are studying the basic,
3899100	3900780	get us more information about this?
3900780	3902340	Questions, like you mentioned
3902340	3903580	that there's not a whole lot of work
3903580	3905860	understanding the aging aspect of this.
3905860	3909220	Like, what changes about the nine to 11 year olds
3909220	3910640	or whatever that makes their fingertips
3910640	3911900	not regenerate versus before?
3911900	3913740	What's different about the bioelectronite resource
3913740	3916140	or what's involved in human liver regeneration
3916140	3919220	to those networks change over time, things like that?
3919220	3921740	And the question Allison asks at the end,
3921740	3923220	which maybe she was still saving
3923220	3924460	is what can this group do for you?
3924460	3926820	So maybe in relation to that question,
3928660	3931260	are you doing anything to encourage research labs
3931260	3934580	that focus on aging to nudge in this direction?
3934580	3939580	Yeah, so overall, definitely there are not that many labs.
3940180	3943180	It's still relatively speaking a small field.
3944100	3947260	There are people who work in bioelectricity
3947260	3948940	and don't know they work in bioelectricity.
3948940	3951820	And what I mean by that is people who, for example,
3951820	3953860	if you study Anderson-Taywell syndrome, right?
3953860	3954780	And you're a geneticist
3954780	3955980	and you don't care about bioelectricity,
3955980	3957820	but you care about Anderson-Taywell syndrome.
3957820	3958940	And then eventually you sequence
3958940	3961020	and you find out that, whoa, it's a potassium channel.
3961020	3962740	Why do my potassium channel patients
3962740	3964380	have craniofacial dysmorphias?
3964380	3966540	Well, now you're working in developmental bioelectricity,
3967020	3970100	so there are some folks that sort of get dragged
3970100	3974380	into it that way, but labs that really focus on this,
3974380	3977260	there aren't that many, there really aren't that many.
3977260	3980460	And in particular, getting money for profiling
3980460	3981660	is almost impossible, right?
3981660	3984020	If you're lucky, if you can from standard sources
3984020	3985660	and IH and so on, you're lucky
3985660	3987660	if you can get funding for functional data,
3987660	3991220	like I'm going to figure out what these ion channels do
3991220	3993700	in drosophila development or something like this,
3994660	3997100	you can do that, but getting money
3997100	4000380	for a comprehensive profiling project,
4000380	4004660	the way that they do in, when they have these,
4004660	4006700	let's figure out what every cell in the brain
4006700	4007620	is expressing, right?
4007620	4011460	And the Allen brain atlas and these kinds of things,
4011460	4013340	getting funding for that is almost impossible,
4013340	4017100	so no one's done it.
4017100	4018740	As far as your last question,
4018740	4022540	yeah, I mean, I would love to get into aging,
4022580	4025580	I'd love to collaborate with anybody in this community.
4025580	4028180	Generally speaking, what we've been doing for years now
4028180	4030860	to try and lower the barrier for other people to get in
4030860	4033620	is that we publish a lot of reviews
4033620	4035420	and a lot of how-to protocols.
4035420	4037780	So we put everything online as far as if you wanted
4037780	4039860	to get into this from whatever system,
4039860	4041060	whatever you're interested in,
4041060	4044500	here is like literally step A, B, C,
4044500	4046380	how, what do you do next, right?
4046380	4048980	And so we send out gift baskets of reagents,
4048980	4053980	we provide all the plasmids, the dye protocols,
4054180	4056100	all the data interpretation stuff,
4056100	4058060	we all have that as out there.
4058060	4059180	So anybody that's interested,
4059180	4062180	I would be more than happy to help you guys do this.
4062180	4063020	It'd be great.
4064740	4065700	Fantastic, thank you.
4065700	4069140	And well, you also mentioned there's a company, right?
4069140	4072460	And would you make clear quickly at the beginning of the talk?
4072460	4074300	And so what's happening with that next?
4074300	4076380	What are your next steps in this arena?
4076380	4080420	Yeah, it's basically the company is,
4081860	4085340	the initial focus is quite narrow, it's limb regeneration.
4085340	4088020	And so what we're doing is we're testing our various cocktails
4088020	4091540	in mice using David Kaplan's wearable bioreactor,
4091540	4094540	short-term application, our ion channel cocktail,
4094540	4097140	can we trigger limb regeneration?
4097140	4098380	That's the beginning.
4098380	4103380	Obviously my dream is to grow this to a kind of fundamental
4104380	4108260	approach to picking electroseuticals
4108260	4111020	for all sorts of indications from birth defects
4111020	4114060	to regenerative medicine to aging to cancer.
4114060	4116860	But right now it's just about limb regeneration.
4118580	4121260	Okay, and anything people in this group could do there
4121260	4122620	to help, like are you looking for collaborators
4122620	4124340	with that company or like investors
4124340	4126980	or is there anything, what are our next steps?
4126980	4131980	Sure, we're certainly happy to hear from investors.
4132260	4134780	For sure, anybody that wants to collaborate,
4134780	4136620	drop me an email and let me know what you do
4136620	4139380	and we'll see what makes sense.
4139380	4141780	Yeah, our lab is very collaborative,
4141780	4142860	we work with all kinds of people.
4142860	4145580	So for sure, I'd love to hear from this community.
4146780	4148580	Great, well, it seems like you're already collaborating,
4148580	4152940	at least with Vadim, be known around Cornus.
4152940	4154540	One final thing, which is,
4154540	4157220	we ask people to submit a longevity channel challenge,
4157220	4158220	which you've done.
4158220	4160260	And this is just another pack
4160260	4161980	that people can answer this challenge
4161980	4164980	and actually, again, up to $250 doing.
4164980	4167100	So do you want to say maybe a few words
4167100	4169860	about the challenge that you submitted?
4169860	4172660	Yeah, well, I mean, so I wasn't really familiar
4172660	4175980	with how all this works, but basically,
4175980	4178380	the big challenge in this field that I see
4178380	4181660	is just what I think, let's put it this way,
4181660	4185220	what I think would make a real breakthrough
4185220	4187860	and move the field forward, kind of a watershed effect,
4187860	4191580	would be the ability to really image
4191580	4192780	these bioelectric states
4192780	4195020	in all sorts of important conditions.
4195020	4197140	And not because imaging by itself,
4197140	4199540	I really focus on functional experiments.
4199540	4201460	I mean, seeing the beautiful patterns is nice,
4201460	4203620	but more importantly, are they instructive, right?
4203620	4205700	Can I show that when you alter the pattern,
4205700	4207700	the gene expression changes and the anatomy changes,
4207700	4208540	and we do that.
4208540	4209820	And so that's what my lab is focused on.
4209820	4212140	But it would certainly make it much easier
4212140	4215060	to develop those kind of functional approaches
4215060	4218620	if we had the baseline data from other model systems,
4218620	4220940	other conditions, various disease conditions,
4220940	4223740	various human organs, this would be a real game changer.
4223740	4226140	So that's what I plan.
