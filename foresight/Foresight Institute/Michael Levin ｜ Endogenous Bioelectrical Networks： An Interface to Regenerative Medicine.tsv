0	3400	Welcome, everyone, to Fossett's biotech seminar series.
3400	5280	Really excited to have Michael Levin here again.
5280	8160	I discovered your work, I think, about five years ago
8160	9960	in one of your New Europe's presentations
9960	11440	on what bodies think about.
11440	12760	Was totally startled by it.
12760	14840	Could not believe what you were discussing there
14840	17360	until we had you on, I think, two or three years ago,
17360	19480	for Fossett's seminar a while back.
19480	21200	Also, I think the topic was taming
21200	22720	the collective intelligence of self
22720	25440	with a focus also on possible regeneration
25440	26840	and longevity implications.
26840	29240	Since then, I have contacted you quite a few times
29240	31680	to ask if you want to nominate Fossett,
31680	33440	because we really want to explore a little bit more
33440	36640	the longevity and, like, bio-angle of much of your work.
36640	38280	Since then, you have not stopped working.
38280	39480	In fact, quite the opposite.
39480	41720	You have now produced some really mind-boggling bits
41720	44080	on Xenobots and Amphobots ever since.
44080	46200	And so hopefully, we may get into some of that
46200	47480	also during the Q&A.
47480	49760	And then most recently, you were on a cognitive revolution
49760	52480	podcast and discussed some of the implications of your work
52480	55680	for AI, and especially for a new and bio-inspired approach
55680	56560	to intelligence.
56560	58040	That was really interesting.
58080	60600	We have launched our AI safety grant since then.
60600	62960	And many, not many, but a few of the applications
62960	66560	actually actively referenced your work in the AI applications.
66560	69800	So I'm just really excited to discuss, hopefully, some
69800	70880	of these things in the Q&A.
70880	72640	But for now, please take it away.
72640	73760	Thank you so much for joining.
73760	75520	Today, are you discussing indulgence
75520	78360	in bio-electrical networks and interface
78360	79800	to regenerative medicine?
79800	81880	And hopefully, we can tease out some of the longevity
81880	84120	implications and some of the AI implications
84120	85080	afterwards in the Q&A.
85080	86240	Thanks a lot for joining.
86240	87560	We are big fans of your work.
87600	89200	And please take it away.
89200	90080	Thank you so much.
90080	91920	That's a very kind introduction.
91920	93800	Thank you so much for having me here.
93800	96080	I'm very excited to share some ideas with you.
96080	98240	And what I'd like to talk to you about
98240	100440	is basically the following point.
100440	102200	That I'm going to make the argument
102200	105240	that bodies consist of a kind of multi-scale competency
105240	106280	architecture.
106280	108600	And the key element of this is that there's
108600	110640	problem-solving intelligence at every level,
110640	114640	from the molecular networks to organs and swarms and so on.
114640	117080	I'm going to make the argument that definitive regenerative
117080	118640	medicine is really going to require
118640	120920	us to exploit this collective intelligence.
120920	122920	What it amounts to is communicating
122920	126720	our anatomical goals in morphospace to the cells.
126720	129400	And the particular interface that we exploit
129400	132080	is the endogenous bio-electrical networks that
132080	134240	are present in all tissues.
134240	137400	This is an extremely tractable and powerful interface
137400	138640	for top-down control.
138640	139960	And I'm going to show you the tools
139960	142840	that we've made to read and write the pattern memories
142840	145800	into what is basically the protocognitive medium
145840	148040	of the collective intelligence of cells.
148040	150200	I'm going to show you some beginning applications
150200	154000	in areas like birth defects, regenerative repair, cancer.
154000	157000	And we can talk about how these are heading towards biomedicine.
157000	159360	So in order to heal and restore function,
159360	161880	we really need to understand the agential material
161880	163880	we're working with because it's completely
163880	165400	different than the kind of engineering
165400	166680	we've done in the past.
166680	169680	So for thousands of years, we worked with passive materials.
169680	171240	And the thing about passive materials
171240	173800	is that the only thing you can rely on them to do
173800	175720	is to stay where you put them.
175720	177440	And so it's on you as the engineer,
177440	179600	like with, let's say, Legos or wood or metal
179600	181600	to put them exactly where you want them.
181600	183200	And at best, they're going to remain there.
183200	185320	And you have to be the one to implement
185320	187320	all the different functionalities.
187320	190440	But engineers have increasingly started working on
190440	193520	with active matter and even computational materials.
193520	195920	And for us, bio-engineers and workers
195920	199360	in regenerative medicine, we work in agential material.
199360	201400	And you can imagine right away how different
201400	203840	that type of engineering is when you think about
203880	206480	what it takes to build a tower out of Legos
206480	208440	versus a tower out of dogs.
208440	211160	If you build a tower out of Legos, it's very straightforward.
211160	212560	You put everything where it goes.
212560	214840	But if that tower falls over, that's the end.
214840	217280	And you can't really expect it to do anything beyond that.
217280	219720	The dogs initially are absolutely not going to stay
219720	222520	where you put them, but they offer an amazing interface
222520	225200	having to do with training and memory and learning.
225200	227440	And if you train them to stand on top of each other,
227440	230440	then once you knock the tower over, they'll get back up
230440	232760	and they'll do the thing they're supposed to do.
232760	235520	And so you can see the pros and cons of this.
235520	237760	It requires you to really understand your material
237760	240560	to know which type of techniques you're going to use.
240560	242920	And people argue a lot about this notion
242920	244840	of whether bodies are actually machines,
244840	247520	if there's a difference between machines and organisms.
247520	250920	And I don't believe that these are absolute binary categories
250920	254160	in any way, but what we want is a plethora of approaches
254160	255000	at the right levels.
255000	257120	You definitely want an orthopedic surgeon
257120	258720	who believes your body is a machine
258720	260360	because they get to use tools like this.
260360	263040	They use chisels and screws and hammers and so on.
263040	264880	But what you don't want is a psychoanalyst
264880	266640	who thinks you're that kind of machine, right?
266640	269280	And so different types of problems
269280	270800	require different levels of solution.
270800	274440	And after the orthopedic surgeon does their thing,
274440	276600	they then send you home to heal.
276600	279240	And it is that part, the part that we don't micromanage,
279240	280960	that is the really interesting part
280960	283760	where the collective intelligence of the bodies
283760	284880	really takes hold.
284880	287680	And ultimately, we can discuss this at the end.
287680	288680	I won't get into it here,
288680	291120	but the people who work on placebo and nocebo effects
291120	293600	and so on, like Fabrizio Benedetti,
293600	296840	says words and drugs have the same mechanism of action.
296840	298000	And this is extremely deep
298000	300040	because what this is reminding us of
300040	302480	is that there is a multi-scale architecture
302480	305160	that has a language understanding at the top
305160	306720	and all kinds of other levels
306720	309160	eventually reaching the molecular level.
309160	312200	And our body is actually an amazing architecture
312200	315240	that lets your high level executive goals,
315240	317680	for example, social goals, scientific goals and so on,
317680	320720	to literally move calcium and other ions
320720	322720	across your membranes and your cells
322720	325160	so that you can walk and do voluntary motion
325160	327440	and go about your day to try to achieve those goals.
327440	329640	So our body has that kind of architecture
329640	333480	that literally links mental, long range mental goals
333480	335240	to the movement of chemicals
335240	337520	that allow you to enact those goals.
337520	341040	So across this, what I call the spectrum of persuadability
341040	345440	because it puts the emphasis on how we are going to use
345440	346680	different types of tools
346680	349200	to get the system to do various things.
349200	351280	Across that spectrum of persuadability,
351280	352960	we have many different waypoints.
352960	355320	You have simple machines, you have homeostats
355320	356640	and then you have learning agents
356640	359720	and then you have rational thinkers and planners and so on
359720	362040	and completely different sets of tools.
362040	366280	So hardware rewiring here and then cybernetics here
366280	369280	and maybe control theory and then behavioral science
369280	371600	and then maybe other interesting things
371600	374040	like psychiatry and so on.
374040	375640	So one might ask the question,
375640	378880	where do cellular collectives fit into this spectrum?
378880	381160	The assumption, and I think most people make this assumption
381160	382760	is that it's got to be somewhere here,
382760	384760	maybe a little bit here,
384760	387080	but I want to really emphasize the idea
387080	388720	that is very much an assumption.
388720	390640	That is a philosophical commitment.
390640	393040	The thing we need to do as scientists and engineers
393040	393880	is do experiments.
393880	395520	We need to find out where they fit
395520	397440	because my claim is that humans
397440	399600	are actually not very good at guessing these things.
399600	400960	So we need to do experiments
400960	404160	and that amounts to asking what tools in particular
404160	406040	the tools of these other disciplines
406040	409000	are really powerful in getting cellular collectives
409000	410680	to do interesting things.
410680	412720	Now, as we start to talk about intelligence,
412720	414880	it's important to work backwards.
414880	417560	So here we are, if we believe that we are high level
417560	420200	metacognitive beings with true goals and memories
420200	421400	and preferences and so on.
421400	424440	So here we are, where did all those things come from?
424440	427560	Working backwards, both evolutionarily and developmentally,
427560	428560	they came from here.
428560	432160	We were all once a single unfertilized OSI.
432160	433440	So people look at this cell
433440	435040	and they see a little blob of chemistry
435040	438240	and they say that really just obeys the laws of physics.
438240	440640	There is no cognition there.
440640	444040	But the deepest lesson of developmental biology
444040	446280	is that there is no magic lightning flash
446280	448640	during this process at which you go from being
448640	452120	quote unquote, just physics to having a complex mind.
452120	453640	So that means our goal,
453640	455240	and we all make this journey across
455240	457360	this so-called Cartesian cut.
457360	461000	So that means that our goal is to really understand
461000	462160	the scaling of minds.
462160	465040	We really need to understand how the primitive competencies
465040	467160	of molecular networks and single cells
467160	470400	slowly but surely become large scale competencies
470400	473320	in new problem spaces.
473320	475520	And this is something that I think Turing
475520	476920	actually understood quite well,
476920	478920	although he didn't talk about it much,
478920	481040	that the self assembly of the body
481040	483560	and the self assembly and the scale up of minds
483560	484880	is really the same problem.
484880	487600	This is why the father of computer science
487600	489160	who thought a lot about intelligence
489160	492240	and mathematics and thinking and so on
492240	495360	also had a paper on self-organization of chemicals
495360	496880	in an embryogenesis.
496880	498400	I think he was onto this.
498400	500560	This is the kind of stuff that we are made of.
500560	502520	This happens to be a free living organism,
502520	505160	but I just wanna show you, this is a lacrimaria.
505160	508200	I wanna show you what a single cell is capable of.
508200	510480	No brain, no nervous system.
510480	512280	Everything is handled in one cell.
512280	517080	So all of this animals, morphological, physiological,
517080	520920	anatomical, metabolic needs are handled within one cell.
520920	523400	And we have to ask ourselves the question
523400	526440	of what connection policies are there for beings
526440	528560	with their own agendas and their own competencies
528560	531080	to get together and do larger scale things.
531080	534440	Interestingly, intelligence does not appear first
534440	535640	in whole cells.
535640	538040	In fact, even gene regulatory networks,
538040	539520	and you can see the details in these papers,
539520	541320	even gene regulatory networks,
541320	542800	if you look at them correctly
542800	544920	or if you look at them the right way,
544920	547440	you can actually discover six different kinds of learning
547440	549400	that simple pathways can do.
549400	552480	So no need for cells, no need for plasma membranes
552480	555320	or any of that, just a small number of nodes
555320	558120	turning each other on and off is already sufficient
558120	560920	to do things like associative conditioning.
560920	563080	And that has massive implications for biomedicine,
563080	564680	which we can talk about.
564680	565840	So the first part of this talk,
565840	568920	I want to focus on the competencies of the material.
568920	571520	I wanna really drill down and show off
571520	574720	some of the amazing kinds of capabilities of the material
574720	576800	that we're dealing with because that bears on
576800	579600	what kind of technologies are possible.
579600	583360	Here's one example of the implications
583360	584960	of being made of this kind of material.
584960	586800	So this is a tappel of the frog,
586800	587880	you'll see a lot of those today.
587880	589520	So here are the nostrils, here's the mouth,
589520	590960	here's the brain, the gut.
590960	592440	What you'll notice is that we've prevented
592440	594400	the primary eyes from forming here,
594400	596360	but we put an eye on his tail.
596360	599360	And it turns out that these animals can see perfectly,
599360	601360	well, we test them in this machine that we built,
601360	603280	we built a custom machine to train
603280	605040	and test them on visual cues.
605040	607120	They can see because they can learn to perform
607120	608680	in these visual assays.
608680	611200	This ectopic eye does not connect to the brain,
611200	613120	it will often make us an optic nerve
613120	615880	that can connect and synapse on the spinal cord here.
615880	617720	So think about the amazing plasticity here,
617720	621040	without new generations of adaptation, selection,
621040	622520	this animal out of the gate
622520	625600	with a completely different sensory motor architecture,
625600	627800	that brain realizes that the information
627800	629240	being put onto its spinal cord
629240	632040	by this weird itchy patch of posterior tissue
632040	635520	is good enough to understand its world as visual data
635520	637800	and is able to process and behave accordingly.
637800	640240	That plasticity is a major theme here.
640240	641800	Another example of plasticity
641800	644600	that dissolves the distinction between memory
644600	648320	and body structure can be seen in planaria.
648320	650920	These flatworms, one of the main amazing characteristics
650920	652680	that they have is that they regenerate.
652680	654080	So you can cut them into pieces
654080	657160	and each piece will give rise to a complete worm.
657160	659240	So one thing that was known since the 60s
659240	661520	is that if you train them on a particular task,
661520	663960	for example, to look for food around these bumpy little,
663960	665600	these laser-etched little areas,
665600	667520	so place conditioning basically,
667520	669800	you cut off their head in their centralized brain,
669800	671720	the tail will sit there not doing anything
671720	673600	other than growing a brand new head
673600	675760	and a little bit more than a week later,
675760	676800	they've grown back in your head
676800	679280	and you find out that these animals remember perfectly well
679280	682080	where the liver was, which is what they eat.
682080	684200	What we see here is the amazing ability
684200	686280	to not only regenerate your memories,
686280	689520	but to imprint whatever information is present,
689520	691120	presumably in the rest of the body
691120	692960	so that we don't know yet where it is,
692960	694560	but to imprint that information
694560	696920	onto a newly growing brain.
696920	698480	So think about what that might mean
698480	700400	for future therapeutics when a patient
700400	702560	with six or seven decades of memories,
702560	706360	of personality, of history suddenly has a large chunk
706360	710240	of their brain replaced with the descendants of stem cells.
710240	712200	In terms of, are you still going to get the same,
712200	713920	the same individual?
713920	715720	Is it going to be more like a newborn baby?
715720	717600	What these kind of models suggest
717600	720440	that actually memories might persist quite well.
720440	723160	In fact, it's even more impressive what happens
723160	726160	in the caterpillar to butterfly transition.
726160	729360	These animals start out as a kind of two-dimensional,
729360	731720	it's a creature that lives in a two-dimensional world.
731720	733720	It crawls around and eats leaves
733720	735840	and it has a brain that's suitable for that.
735840	737960	Eventually it has to metamorphose
737960	739920	into a much different animal.
739920	741840	So this is like a soft-bodied robot.
741840	743320	It has no hard components.
743320	744400	This is completely different.
744400	746440	The movement types are entirely different.
746440	748040	This is a hard-bodied creature.
748040	751280	It flies in the 3D world, it drinks nectar.
751280	753640	And during this process, the brain is basically dissolved.
753640	754920	Most of the connections are broken.
754920	756440	Most of the cells are killed off.
756440	758080	A new brain is rebuilt.
758080	761120	But the remarkable part is not only do the butterflies
761120	765520	remember the training that the caterpillars received,
765520	767560	but actually they remap that training
767560	770120	with new salience onto a new body plant.
770120	772960	Because if you train these caterpillars to associate,
772960	776320	for example, a particular color stimulus with leaves,
776320	777960	what the butterfly doesn't care about leaves,
777960	781640	what the butterfly remembers is to go look for food
781640	783440	on those same color discs.
783440	785680	So that information is actually generalized,
785680	788040	not leaves, but food, the category food,
788040	790240	and remapped onto the new food,
790240	792800	more appropriate to the different body structure.
792800	796360	So this is not just a matter of where does the information
796360	797880	stay during brain remodeling.
797880	798960	That's the first question.
798960	799840	But the second question is,
799840	802280	how does that information get remapped
802280	804440	onto the new life of this individual?
804440	805920	And so you can think about what that means,
805920	808640	the ability to remap information onto new bodies.
808640	811880	Think human augmentation, new embodiments for future humans,
811880	813080	brain modification,
813080	816040	and how the information is going to persist.
816040	818840	So what we have, again, in biology
818840	820320	is this multi-scale architecture
820320	822800	where all the way from molecular networks,
822800	826600	all the way up, every layer is a problem-solving system.
826600	829560	They're not just structurally different size scales.
829560	832160	They actually have competencies to solve problems
832160	833720	in different spaces.
833720	837040	And there are multiple spaces that they operate in,
837040	840200	gene transcription spaces, a physiological state space.
840200	842720	We're going to spend most of the time talking
842720	844640	about this anatomical morpho space,
844640	845920	but just to remind us that,
845920	847280	to really be humble about this,
847280	849680	because we humans are okay
849680	853640	at recognizing the intelligence of medium-sized objects
853640	856200	moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space.
856200	859560	So crows and dogs and horses and maybe an octopus,
859560	860480	maybe a whale.
860480	862600	But we're really not very good
862680	864760	at recognizing intelligence in these other spaces
864760	867880	because all of our sense organs are very much aimed
867880	870920	at this kind of a one-narrow range of embodiments.
870920	873320	And I often like to think that if we had evolved
873320	876840	with a primary sensor of our blood chemistry
876840	878440	so that you can feel the blood chemistry,
878440	880520	the way that we currently see and hear and so on,
880520	882920	I think we would have no problem recognizing
882920	885880	that we live in a multi-dimensional space
885880	888200	and that our liver and our kidneys are, in fact,
888200	891320	intelligent agents that navigate that space adaptively
891880	894120	in terms of all the different things that happen to us.
894120	897000	So we're going to look at anatomical morpho space,
897000	899640	and which is basically just a multi-dimensional space
899640	901400	of all the different possible shapes
901400	903160	that something could undertake.
903160	904760	And we're gonna ask a basic question.
904760	907800	This is a cross-section through a human torso.
907800	909480	So look at this amazing order.
909480	911480	All these different organs are almost always
911480	914440	in the right shape, the right size, next to the right thing.
914440	916040	But we start out life like this,
916040	918200	a collection of embryonic blastomers.
918200	919800	Where does this pattern come from?
919800	921240	Where does it encode it?
921320	924440	And when I give this, I've given versions of this talk
924440	925960	to our middle school children,
925960	927560	and even the nine-year-olds immediately say,
927560	928520	oh, it's in the DNA.
928520	930360	They say it's in the genome.
930360	933240	But the thing is, we can sequence genomes now.
933240	935640	It was always clear, really, that this was not in the genome.
935640	938200	But a lot of scientists talk as if that's the case.
938200	940600	And now we know when you read the genome,
940600	943240	you don't see any of this, which is protein structure.
943240	946360	You see the description of the tiniest molecular hardware
946360	947560	that every cell gets to have.
947560	949080	You don't see directly information
949080	951000	about size, shape, symmetry type.
951000	954280	And so we need to understand how do these cells,
954280	956280	this genomically specified hardware,
956280	958040	how does it know what to build?
958040	959560	How does it know when to stop?
959560	962280	If something is missing, how do we convince it to rebuild?
962280	964280	And as engineers, we want to go one step further
964280	965960	and ask, what else could you build?
965960	967880	If we wanted to build something completely different
967880	969880	out of the same parts, could you?
969880	972680	Or all this talk of developmental constraints,
972680	975960	is that really a confining paradigm?
976760	980280	So let's think about what the future is supposed to look like.
980280	981720	What's the end game for this field?
981720	984120	I think that what we're talking about
984120	986680	is something we call an anatomical compiler.
986680	989320	So the idea is that someday you will sit down
989320	993960	in front of a software system and draw the plant, animal,
993960	996120	organ, or biobot that you want to build.
996120	999400	In this case, we've drawn a three-headed flatworm.
999400	1002360	So having drawn the anatomy, the functional anatomy
1002360	1004200	that you want, what the system should be able to do
1004200	1007640	is compile that down to a set of stimuli
1007720	1010520	that could be given to cells to build that structure.
1010520	1011800	So not a 3D printer.
1011800	1014120	This is not about micromanaging where the cells go.
1014120	1016200	This is about convincing a group of cells
1016200	1018200	to build exactly what you want them to build
1018200	1020920	and not whatever it was that they were going to build before.
1020920	1022280	So two key questions first.
1022280	1023480	Why do we even need this thing?
1023480	1026120	Because not only for the understanding of evolution
1026120	1027160	and information and so on,
1027160	1030120	but very practically most biomedical problems.
1030120	1032840	So birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging,
1032840	1035640	degenerative disease, all of these things would go away
1035640	1038680	if we knew how to convince groups of cells to build
1038680	1040840	whatever organs we wanted them to build.
1040840	1044200	Now, the other question might be, why don't we have this yet?
1044200	1046200	Genetics and molecular biology
1046200	1048440	has been going gangbusters for decades.
1048440	1050040	Why do we not have this thing yet?
1050040	1053080	I just want to illustrate one simple puzzle.
1053080	1055240	This is the axolotl larvae
1055240	1057400	and baby axolotls have little forelegs.
1057400	1059320	This is a tadpole of the frog.
1059320	1061880	At this stage, these guys do not have forelegs.
1061880	1064040	In my lab, we make something called a frogolotl.
1064040	1065160	So if we make a frogolotl,
1065160	1067000	it's got a bunch of embryonic cells from here,
1067000	1068600	a bunch of embryonic cells from here,
1068600	1070280	and you get a chimeric embryo.
1070920	1073400	Now, the axolotl genome is sequenced.
1073400	1075400	The frog genome has been sequenced.
1075400	1076360	Very simple question.
1076360	1077720	You've got both sequences.
1077720	1079240	Could you tell me whether a frogolotl
1079240	1080680	is going to have legs or not?
1080680	1081560	And the answer is no.
1081560	1083560	We have no way currently of knowing
1083560	1085080	the answer to these kind of questions.
1085080	1086600	In fact, if you didn't already know
1086600	1088520	what a tadpole or an axolotl looked like,
1088520	1089960	you couldn't even give me the shape of it
1089960	1091240	from looking at the genome.
1091240	1092120	It's very important to understand
1092120	1093480	what kind of information we have
1093560	1095240	and what kind of information we do not have.
1096040	1098600	So the state of the field currently is this.
1098600	1101400	We are very good at manipulating cells and molecules.
1101400	1104040	And all of the most exciting advances today
1104040	1105080	are about the hardware.
1105080	1107960	Everybody's really into genomic editing,
1107960	1110520	pathway remodeling, protein engineering.
1110520	1111720	All of these things are hardware.
1111720	1113640	They're focused at the molecular hardware level,
1114360	1117480	like where computer science was in the 40s and 50s.
1117480	1119640	So this is what programming used to look like.
1119640	1122200	She's physically rewiring this machine.
1122200	1124360	Now, the reason nowadays, when you're on your laptop
1124360	1125880	and you want to go from, I don't know,
1125880	1128040	PowerPoint to Microsoft Word,
1128040	1129720	the reason you don't get out your soldering iron
1129720	1132520	and start rewiring is because computer science
1132520	1134120	took advantage of something remarkable,
1134120	1136600	the fact that certain kinds of hardware
1136600	1139720	are reprogrammable and in fact can support
1139720	1145400	a layered, multi-scale, modular set of software,
1145400	1147640	or in our case, it's going to be physiology,
1147640	1149960	that allows you to do interesting things
1149960	1152120	with the exactly the same piece of hardware
1152120	1153160	without rewiring.
1153160	1154600	So this is what we're missing now.
1154600	1157320	But I'm going to argue that molecular medicine
1157320	1158280	is basically here.
1158280	1160680	I spoke to a major investor once who said that
1161320	1163800	in their firm, they think of biology today,
1163800	1166440	where computer science was in the year 2000.
1166440	1168360	And I think that's, that isn't as way wrong.
1168360	1171800	I think it's where we were in the 40s and 50s.
1171800	1173320	We can go a much higher than this.
1173320	1174920	And the thing that's still missing
1174920	1177000	is to understand the biological softwares,
1177000	1178440	to understand the intelligence
1178440	1179560	that we can take advantage of.
1180040	1181560	So when I say intelligence, what do I?
1181560	1183480	William James's nice definition,
1183480	1185720	which is the ability to reach the same goal
1185720	1186840	by different means.
1186840	1188440	It's a very cybernetic definition.
1188440	1190040	It doesn't talk about what kind of brain you have,
1190040	1191160	or whether you have a cortex,
1191160	1193560	or what space you're even working in.
1193560	1195320	Same goal by different means.
1195320	1198200	The ability to reach certain states in that space
1198200	1200920	when faced with interventions, when things change.
1200920	1204120	How much competency do you have to still get your job done?
1204120	1206440	So let's look, what kind of collective intelligence
1206440	1208360	can we find in cellular swarms?
1208360	1210760	What are the capabilities of our system
1210760	1211960	that we're trying to rewire?
1211960	1213560	What's the toolkit that we have?
1213560	1216200	This is one of my all-time favorite examples.
1216840	1220440	This is a cross-section through a kidney tubule of a nut,
1220440	1223000	and eight to 10 cells normally making this thing up.
1223000	1225640	One thing you can do to early embryos
1225640	1229640	is multiply the amount of DNA in their nuclei.
1229640	1231160	So if you can make a polyploid,
1231160	1233880	nutes that have two and four and six and so on.
1233880	1236200	If you do that, the cells become larger,
1236200	1237400	and you find out that,
1237400	1239240	actually, you still get the same size nut,
1239240	1241640	and that's because fewer cells get together
1241640	1243800	and make the same anatomical structure.
1243800	1245400	So amazing thing, number one,
1245400	1247960	is that you could have multiple copies of your genome
1247960	1249560	that doesn't seem to mess anything up.
1249560	1252600	Number two, you could have abnormally large cells,
1252600	1253560	and they still figure out
1253560	1255640	how many of them there need to be to do this.
1255640	1257240	But the most amazing thing
1257240	1259080	is that if you make the cells truly gigantic,
1259080	1261560	and I think this is maybe six and nutes.
1261560	1263160	If you make the cells truly gigantic,
1263960	1265640	what they will do is wrap around themselves
1265640	1267880	to give you the same anatomical structure.
1267880	1269320	And what's remarkable about that
1269320	1271240	is that this is a different molecular mechanism.
1271240	1274040	This is cell-to-cell communication and tubular genesis.
1274040	1276120	This is cytoskeletal bending.
1276120	1279640	And so in the service of a large-scale anatomical goal,
1279640	1282840	different molecular components are being called up.
1282840	1284120	Now, just think about what this means.
1284120	1285800	If you're a nude coming into the world,
1285800	1287000	what can you rely on?
1287000	1289080	We tend to think you've had eons of evolution,
1289080	1291480	you've had all this experience with your environment.
1291480	1294200	You can't count on how much DNA you have.
1294200	1296680	You can't count on how many copies of anything you have.
1296680	1298360	You can't count on your cell size.
1298360	1300520	You can't count on how many cells you have.
1300520	1302120	You have to be able to get your job done
1302120	1305000	despite massive variation in your own parts.
1305000	1307000	We don't have even the beginnings of technology
1307000	1309800	that has that kind of problem-solving competencies
1309800	1310760	and capacity.
1311880	1313800	This is a more familiar example.
1314360	1317720	We know that embryos reliably go from a single cell
1317720	1319560	to a complex organism,
1319560	1321160	but it's not a hardwired process.
1321160	1323320	It's reliable, but it isn't hardwired.
1323320	1325480	Because if you cut these embryos into pieces,
1325480	1327400	you do not end up with half bodies.
1327400	1330280	You end up with monozygotic twins and triplets.
1330280	1333320	So what happens is that from different starting positions,
1333320	1336040	and this is again called back to James' definition,
1336040	1337560	from different starting positions,
1337560	1339400	you can navigate that morpho space
1339400	1341880	and get to that same ensemble of goal states
1341880	1346680	that basically maps to a normal variation
1346680	1348200	around the human target morphology.
1349240	1352120	In many species, this is not just an embryonic thing.
1352120	1355400	For example, axolotls can regenerate their legs,
1355400	1359240	their eyes, their jaws, portions of their brain and heart,
1359240	1360600	spinal cord ovaries.
1360600	1365080	And what happens if they lose a limb anywhere along this axis,
1365080	1368200	they will rebuild exactly as much as needed,
1368200	1369720	whether from here or from here,
1369720	1371640	from different starting positions they get here.
1371640	1373960	And here's the most amazing thing about regeneration.
1373960	1376760	And everybody's excited about cranking up regeneration
1376760	1378520	for therapeutic purposes.
1378520	1381480	But actually the most amazing thing about regeneration
1381480	1382760	is that it stops.
1382760	1384920	How does it know when to stop?
1384920	1387800	It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed,
1387800	1389240	and that turns out to be very profound.
1390200	1392840	Now, it's not as if this is just for frogs
1392840	1397160	and salamanders and flatworms.
1397160	1399320	The human liver is highly regenerative,
1399320	1400840	even the ancient Greeks knew that.
1400840	1402280	I'm not sure how, but they did.
1403160	1405480	Human children regenerate their fingertips
1405480	1406680	below a certain age.
1406680	1408680	And deer, large adult mammals,
1408680	1412360	regenerate a centimeter and a half of new bone per day
1412360	1414120	when they're regrowing their antlers.
1414120	1416760	So massive amount of regeneration of bone,
1416760	1418680	vasculature, innervation, skin.
1419240	1422360	So the final example that I want to show you before
1422360	1425000	we go to the molecular mechanisms
1425000	1426920	is what happens to the frog face.
1426920	1429160	So this is a tadpole face, here are the eyes,
1429160	1430680	the nostrils, the mouth.
1430680	1431960	And here's what a frog looks like.
1431960	1434760	And so to go from a tadpole to a frog,
1434760	1436840	you need to rearrange the face.
1436840	1438680	These animals, the jaws will move forward,
1438680	1440760	the eyes move, everything moves around.
1440760	1443240	And it used to be thought that this was
1443240	1444840	a hardwired set of movements.
1444840	1447720	If you just somehow code for every organ
1447720	1449240	to move in that particular direction,
1449240	1450760	a particular amount,
1450760	1453000	then what will happen is you'll go from a normal tadpole
1453000	1454280	to a normal frog.
1454280	1456280	We decided to test this and to see actually
1456280	1457800	how much intelligence does this have,
1457800	1460200	and the way you test these things is with perturbations.
1460200	1462680	So what we did was we made a scrambled tadpole
1462680	1464760	called, we call them Picasso tadpoles,
1464760	1466280	where everything is in the wrong place.
1466280	1468440	The eyes on top of the head, the mouth is off to the side,
1468440	1470280	everything is just completely shuffled,
1470280	1473160	like a Mr. Potato Head doll scrambled around.
1473160	1474920	And what happens is that these animals
1474920	1477640	become quite normal frogs, actually,
1477640	1478760	because all of these different things
1478760	1480600	will move in normal paths,
1480600	1483080	in rather abnormal paths,
1483080	1484440	to get to where they need to go,
1484440	1485640	and then the movement stops.
1486600	1488280	So what the genetics gives you is not
1488280	1489640	a set of hardwired movements.
1489640	1491800	What the genetics actually specifies
1491800	1495800	is a machine that can execute an error minimization scheme.
1495880	1497880	It can continue to remodel
1497880	1500280	until certain conditions are met.
1500280	1503560	So those kind of data lead us to revise
1503560	1505800	the basic loop of developmental biology.
1505800	1508760	Normally what you have is there are genes acting
1508760	1509880	in gene regulatory networks,
1509880	1511720	they make some proteins that interact
1511720	1513880	by the laws of physics, all of this is in parallel,
1513880	1515960	and then this magical process of emergence
1515960	1517640	happens and complexity arises,
1517640	1519480	and then you have this beautiful organism.
1519480	1521720	This view, this is what is focused upon
1521720	1523240	in developmental biology textbooks,
1523960	1526600	is an open loop feed forward process
1526600	1529880	that rides along via emergence of complexity.
1529880	1532200	And it is certainly true that there are many systems
1532200	1534040	that will give you complexity
1534040	1536840	from the repeated application of simple rules.
1536840	1537640	There's plenty of that,
1537640	1539720	but that's not where the magic is here,
1540360	1543800	because what we find, which is a property
1543800	1546280	that is not shared by all the computational models
1546280	1549240	of feed forward emergence and complexity,
1549240	1552520	is that if you deviate from this target morphology,
1552520	1553720	and that can be with injury,
1553720	1556280	it can be with mutations, with teratogens.
1556280	1559720	In fact, one can propose that actually
1559720	1562040	this kind of anatomical homeostasis
1562040	1565080	and regenerative capacity was not about injury to start with.
1565080	1567160	The reason this evolution has this
1567160	1570520	is because this is how it was able to deal with mutations,
1570520	1572280	the fact that you know that in your lineage
1572280	1575240	you are going to experience changes of your internal parts.
1575240	1576440	And if you can't deal with that,
1576440	1579160	you're not going to live very long as a lineage.
1579160	1581400	So what happens when you deviate from this,
1581400	1583720	from this target morphology is that some mechanisms kick in
1583720	1586120	both at the level of physics and genetics
1586120	1587480	to try to reduce the error.
1587480	1589160	It's literally like a thermostat in your house.
1589160	1592200	It's an error minimization kind of process.
1592200	1594200	Now, this is on the one hand,
1594200	1596360	biologists know all about homeostatic loops.
1596360	1599080	And of course, we recognize them in terms of pH regulation
1599080	1600680	and temperature and hunger and all that.
1600680	1602520	But there's a couple of unique things here.
1602520	1604280	One is that, first of all,
1604280	1606600	the set point of this homeostatic process
1606600	1607560	is not a single number.
1607560	1610520	It's not a scalar like for hunger or pH.
1610520	1612520	It's a some kind of simplified version
1612520	1614680	of a complex three-dimensional shape.
1614680	1617800	How could we possibly store shape in a group of cells
1617800	1619880	so that they know what they're supposed to build?
1619880	1621240	Now, how do we store this set point?
1621800	1623080	And then the other thing is that
1623080	1625880	in developmental biology and cell biology,
1625880	1628600	really discouraged from talking about goals
1628600	1630600	and those kinds of teleological models.
1630600	1631880	You're supposed to talk about chemistry
1631880	1633480	and the way that chemistry rolls forward
1633480	1636040	to produce emergent complexity.
1636040	1638120	But it's really critical to realize now
1638200	1639160	that since the 40s,
1639160	1641560	we've had in cybernetics and control theory,
1641560	1644840	we've had a mature science of machines with goals.
1644840	1647800	It is no longer magical thinking to say
1647800	1650120	that these kinds of processes have goals.
1650680	1653880	That better be true because we also consist
1653880	1655320	of these kinds of processes.
1655320	1658280	And if they cannot support goal-directed behavior,
1658280	1661480	then it's unclear what to say about our cognition either.
1662040	1663960	This kind of weird view of looking at it
1663960	1665080	to say that the development
1665080	1666920	is actually a goal-directed process
1666920	1669880	that moves towards a kind of target morphology
1670680	1671720	makes a couple of predictions.
1671720	1674440	It means that we should be able to find that mechanism.
1674440	1677960	It means that we should be able to decode it and rewrite it.
1677960	1678840	And if we rewrite it,
1678840	1680520	something amazing becomes possible.
1680520	1683000	It means that in order to make changes here,
1683000	1684840	let's say for regenerative medicine,
1684840	1686520	we don't need to change the genes.
1686520	1687640	And that's really good
1687640	1689240	because it is almost never clear
1689240	1690520	how you would change the genes,
1690520	1692600	even if CRISPR worked perfectly, which it will.
1692600	1693960	At some point, the question is,
1693960	1695160	which genes do you change
1695160	1697080	to make the edits that you want out here?
1697080	1697800	Instead of doing that,
1697800	1699480	we could change the pattern memory
1699480	1701080	and let the cells do what they do best,
1701080	1702600	which is build to it.
1702600	1705400	So we've now, for a couple of decades,
1705400	1706680	we've been pushing this idea
1707320	1710200	and exploring the predictions of this goal-directed behavior.
1710200	1712120	So the first question we needed to ask
1712120	1715160	is where could these pattern memories be stored?
1715160	1717400	And we already have one clear example
1717400	1718440	of collections of cells
1718440	1720600	that store complex patterns
1720600	1722760	as endpoints of goal-directed behavior,
1722760	1723960	and that would be the brain.
1723960	1725720	So in the brain, we know you have
1725720	1727160	electrical networks of cells
1727160	1730200	that produce action potentials
1730200	1731800	and voltage gradients
1731800	1733560	via ion channels across their surface.
1733560	1735480	We call that ZMEM, the resting potential.
1735480	1737560	And that supports an amazing kind of software.
1737560	1740360	Here you can see in vivo physiology
1740360	1741400	of a zebrafish brain,
1742360	1743480	where people in neuroscience
1743480	1744760	try to do neural decoding.
1745400	1746520	The commitment of neuroscience
1746520	1748440	is that if you could understand this physiology,
1748440	1750840	you'd be able to decode the goals,
1750840	1753640	memories, preferences, and so on of this kind of system.
1753720	1756040	All the cognitive kinds of content
1756040	1757240	you should be able to decode
1757240	1758760	from this electrical activity.
1758760	1763080	It turns out that nature really figured out
1763080	1764360	that the electrical networks
1764360	1765960	are really good for this kind of thing
1765960	1766840	very early on.
1767640	1769800	The electrical networks are not about neurons.
1770440	1773160	They were here from the time of bacterial biofilms.
1773160	1775720	And all cells in your body have ion channels
1775720	1777880	and make resting potential gradients.
1777880	1780360	Most of these cells are connected to each other
1780360	1782440	through electrical synapses known as gap junctions.
1783000	1785640	And could we run the same kind of research program?
1785640	1787080	Could we look at, for example,
1787080	1788920	in this case an early frog embryo
1788920	1791400	and read out the electrical information
1791400	1794120	and ask what could this cellular collective
1794120	1794920	be thinking about?
1794920	1797240	We know what this cellular collective thinks about.
1797240	1798600	It largely thinks about movement
1798600	1800120	through three-dimensional space.
1800120	1802680	But embryos move through anatomical morphous space.
1802680	1805480	So could we understand how the earlier version
1805480	1807880	of this electrical system was used
1807880	1810120	to compute and to move us through morphous space?
1810840	1811960	So in our group,
1811960	1814760	we developed several different kinds of tools
1814760	1817000	first to read these patterns.
1817000	1820040	And so here is a voltage-sensitive dye in time lapse
1820040	1822520	showing you all the electrical conversations
1822520	1824200	that these cells are having with each other
1824200	1827240	to sort out where the different organs of the frog embryo
1827240	1828040	are going to be.
1828040	1830040	We do a lot of computational modeling
1830040	1831960	to tie the molecular biology together
1831960	1834520	with the voltage gradients that we observe
1834520	1836920	and ask questions about a pattern completion.
1836920	1838200	So if a part is deleted,
1838200	1840680	how does the network remember the whole and so on?
1841560	1845960	I'm going to show you two example patterns of this.
1845960	1847960	So this is what we call the electric face.
1847960	1849480	And this is a pattern of voltage.
1849480	1851640	Again, the colors indicate resting potential.
1852680	1855960	That this is one frame of the process
1855960	1858600	by which this embryo puts his face together.
1858600	1861560	And you can already see where everything is going to be.
1861560	1863000	The right eye is going to be here.
1863000	1864280	The placodes are out here.
1864280	1865800	The mouth is going to be here.
1865800	1868280	This is a subtle bioelectric pre-pattern
1868280	1870920	that tells these cells where to turn on the genes
1870920	1874360	if they have frizzles, BMPs, and so on to pattern the face.
1874360	1875480	And it's absolutely required.
1875480	1877320	If you change this pattern, the face changes.
1877320	1878280	I'm going to show you that in a minute.
1878920	1880280	Now, that's a normal pattern.
1880840	1882680	There's also pathological patterns,
1882680	1884840	such as when you inject an oncogene,
1884840	1887720	you can actually detect the defection of these cells
1887720	1889960	from the large-scale bioelectrical network
1889960	1892920	and the impending metastasis and tumor genesis.
1892920	1894200	You can see that here.
1894200	1897720	So beyond reading and recording these kind of patterns,
1897720	1899480	the key is to do functional perturbations,
1899480	1900600	do interventions.
1900600	1903400	And so for that reason, we developed some tools
1903400	1907320	to now write the content into that electrical pattern.
1907320	1910360	So just to link all of this back to the key concept
1910360	1911880	from the beginning of the talk,
1911880	1915640	we are literally treating the collective of cells
1915640	1918760	during morphogenesis as a collective intelligence,
1918760	1922360	which exerts behavior in anatomical morphospace.
1922440	1924280	It moves the configuration of the body
1924280	1925320	from that of a single cell
1925320	1928600	to some whatever the complex animal it is or plant.
1928600	1931480	And the idea is that this is literally behavior
1931480	1932600	just in a different space.
1932600	1935000	And we now want to read and write
1935000	1937640	the primitive mind of that collective intelligence.
1938360	1939560	So how do we do this?
1939560	1942040	No magnets, electromagnetic fields,
1942040	1943960	electrodes, radiations, nothing like that.
1944520	1948600	We hijack the native bioelectrical interface
1948600	1951000	that these cells are using to hack each other.
1951000	1952840	So that is the ion channels
1952840	1955160	and the gap junctions that they express.
1955160	1958360	So we basically steal all the tools from neuroscience.
1958360	1962760	So this is ion channel drugs and optogenetics
1962760	1965080	and various manipulations of these channels
1965080	1968280	that you can use to control the voltage pattern
1968280	1969640	in this tissue.
1969640	1971560	When you do that, several things happen.
1971560	1974040	Initially, this work, for example,
1974040	1976280	this eye story was published in 2010.
1976280	1978280	Initially, when we said we wanted to change
1978280	1979480	the resting potential of cells,
1980280	1982200	the background assumption was going to be
1982200	1984680	that what you'll get is uninterpretable toxicity
1984680	1986680	and death because voltage was thought
1986680	1988120	to be a housekeeping parameter.
1988120	1990360	And I want to show you actually what it really does.
1990360	1992760	So what we do here is we inject some,
1992760	1994760	in this particular case, we inject some RNA
1994760	1997480	encoding a set of potassium channels.
1997480	1999320	What they can do with the cells they end up in,
1999320	2001400	once the proteins are made, is set a voltage,
2001400	2004920	a little pattern of voltage that looks like that eye spot
2004920	2006760	that I just showed you in the electric phase.
2006760	2009320	So when you do that, whichever cells get that pattern,
2009480	2011640	they are instructed by that pattern to build an eye.
2011640	2014440	And so here you have eye made from cells
2014440	2016040	that were supposed to be gut.
2016040	2018040	If you section those eyes, you get a lens,
2018040	2019880	retina, optic nerve, all the right stuff.
2019880	2021640	So here we learned some interesting things.
2021640	2024440	First of all, that the bioelectric pattern is instructive.
2024440	2026040	It actually calls up new eyes.
2026040	2027960	It's not just that we messed it up
2027960	2030200	and then the cells died and there's toxicity.
2030200	2031320	No, it's actually instructive.
2031320	2033400	You can call up healthy new organs
2033400	2035560	by specific bioelectric patterns.
2035560	2036600	It's modular.
2036600	2039080	We didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye.
2039080	2040760	In fact, we have no idea how to build an eye.
2040760	2043160	What we found is a high level subroutine,
2043160	2046200	a basically a high level trigger
2046200	2048120	that tells them to build an eye
2048120	2049480	and they take care of the rest.
2049480	2052040	It also, we also find that actually,
2053400	2056280	there's this prompt of this bioelectric pattern
2056280	2058120	reveals more competency in these cells
2058120	2061160	because in the developmental biology textbook,
2061160	2064360	it will tell you that only the anterior and erected room here
2064360	2066120	is competent to make eye.
2066120	2068520	And that's true if you prompt them with the Pac-6,
2068600	2070920	so-called master regulator eye gene.
2070920	2073320	But actually, these cells are perfectly competent.
2073320	2075240	It's just that nobody had prompted them
2075240	2077560	with a more convincing stimulus.
2077560	2079800	And so this again reminds us to be humble
2079800	2081800	in the sense that every assessment
2081800	2083720	of the competency of some system
2083720	2086040	is basically us taking an IQ test ourselves.
2086040	2088280	It's what are we able to discover about that system
2088280	2090040	and we need to be really cautious
2090040	2091400	in putting limits on things
2091400	2092840	when we haven't fully understood
2092840	2094360	what the system is capable of.
2094360	2096760	And finally, what I also really like about this
2096760	2099080	is this amazing property of self-scaling.
2099080	2101880	So this is a lens sitting out in the flank
2101880	2103160	of a tadpole somewhere.
2103160	2105240	The blue cells are the ones that we injected.
2105240	2106600	But look, the rest of the lens
2106600	2109480	is made of clear cells that we never touched directly.
2109480	2111160	So what's happening here is that these cells
2111160	2113080	got the message that they should build an eye,
2113080	2114280	but there's not enough of them.
2114280	2115800	And what they do is they recruit
2115800	2117640	a bunch of their completely normal neighbors,
2117640	2120760	so secondary instruction to help them in this task.
2120760	2121960	And of course, we already know
2121960	2123480	there are other collective intelligences
2123480	2124920	that do this, for example, ants.
2124920	2126280	So if a couple of ants find something
2126280	2127320	that's too heavy for them to lift,
2127320	2130280	what they'll do is recruit others to come and help.
2130280	2132120	So collective intelligences tend to have
2132120	2134760	this self-scaling property and the cells do it.
2134760	2137560	We've deployed this idea of high-level triggers
2137560	2141640	for very complex events for leg regeneration purposes.
2141640	2145160	So frogs, unlike salamanders, do not regenerate their legs.
2145160	2148040	And so if they lose a leg 45 days later, there's nothing.
2148040	2150280	We came up with a cocktail,
2150280	2151960	and this is Kelly Chang's work,
2151960	2155800	where what she did was treat them for 24 hours.
2155800	2158680	And it immediately induces a bunch of pro-regenerative genes.
2158680	2160760	And then by 45 days, you get some toes,
2160760	2163080	you get a toenail, eventually a pretty nice leg
2163080	2165720	that is touch-sensitive and motile.
2165720	2169320	Our latest paper shows one day of treatment
2169320	2171320	followed by a year and a half of leg growth
2171320	2173720	in the mature, fully adult frog.
2173720	2177640	That's, again, this notion of an early decision-making intervention.
2177640	2179720	We're not there to micromanage the stem cells
2179720	2181320	or tell any of the cells where they should go
2181320	2182920	or what the gene expression should be.
2182920	2184520	We have no idea how to do that.
2184520	2186280	And I don't think we will for a really long time,
2186280	2188840	but what we can do is discover the prompts,
2188840	2192120	the stimuli that get the system to undergo
2192120	2194920	certain complex behaviors, morphogenetic behaviors.
2194920	2196520	So here I should do a disclosure,
2197160	2199320	because David Kaplan and I have this spin-off company
2199320	2200760	called Morphosuticals.
2200760	2204440	And what we are doing now is trying this technology in mammals,
2204440	2206520	hopefully eventually towards human patients,
2206520	2208680	but we're nowhere near human patients yet.
2208680	2211720	The idea is to use a wearable bioreactor,
2212040	2216120	an aqueous environment in which we control the bioelectric
2216120	2217800	and other states of these cells
2217800	2221800	and get them to commit early on to a leg-growing behavior
2221800	2223800	versus a scarring behavior.
2223800	2226760	Okay, the next quick story I'm going to tell you is about planaria.
2227320	2228840	And so here are these flatworms.
2228840	2230760	And perhaps one of the most interesting things
2230760	2233080	about these flatworms is that they are immortal.
2233080	2236680	So these theories of aging that say that aging is inevitable,
2236680	2239880	that because it's a kind of accumulation of mistakes
2239960	2242120	and entropic loss and so on,
2242120	2243960	I think they cannot be corrected.
2243960	2246600	The asexual strains of these animals do not age.
2246600	2249160	Nobody's ever seen an old asexual planarian.
2249800	2252840	They just continuously regenerate their bodies.
2252840	2254360	And you might ask a question,
2254360	2256520	if you amputate the head and the tail
2256520	2257880	and you have this middle fragment,
2257880	2259240	how does that middle fragment know
2259240	2261160	how many heads it's supposed to have?
2261160	2263960	Like right here, this piece is going to grow ahead
2263960	2266360	and then the same, the near neighbor cells here
2266360	2267640	are actually going to grow a tail.
2267640	2268840	Why do they do different things?
2268840	2271080	How does this thing know how many heads
2271080	2272600	each fragment is supposed to have?
2272600	2274440	And so we found an electric circuit
2274440	2276760	which maintains a pattern like this
2276760	2278120	that says one head, one tail.
2278120	2280760	And if you cut this reliably, you get one headed worms.
2280760	2283080	And if we rewrite that electrical information
2283080	2285240	using ion channel drug exposure,
2285240	2287080	just for the first few hours,
2287080	2288920	what it'll do is set a voltage pattern
2288920	2290760	that's like this and it holds.
2290760	2293400	And then if you later cut this animal,
2293400	2296520	this perfectly normal anatomically correct looking animal
2296520	2298680	with normal gene expression, normal anatomy,
2298840	2300920	will then regenerate us two heads
2300920	2303800	because that is what its pattern memory says.
2303800	2306040	So I promised you early on in the talk
2306040	2308280	that we are going to find and rewrite
2308280	2311320	the literal pattern memories that the tissue has
2311320	2312920	about what it's supposed to build,
2312920	2313880	what it's supposed to look like.
2313880	2315400	This is it, you're looking at it.
2315400	2318040	These are much scans you might do of a brain.
2318040	2320760	This is the collective intelligence of these cells,
2320760	2322760	maintains a memory, we can read that memory.
2323400	2325240	And this is what this animal now thinks
2325240	2327080	a proper plenarian should look like.
2327640	2329800	It doesn't come into effect until it's injured
2329800	2332200	and the cells are called upon to read that memory
2332200	2333480	until then it's latent.
2333480	2335960	So this is actually a counterfactual memory.
2335960	2337480	The collective intelligence of cells
2337480	2339320	is able to hold counterfactual memories.
2339320	2341320	That's a pretty advanced style capacity actually.
2342280	2343640	Why do I keep calling it a memory?
2343640	2346680	Because if we take this two-headed animal
2346680	2348120	and we cut off the primary head,
2348120	2350200	we cut off this ectopic secondary head,
2350200	2351880	you might think that it should go back to normal.
2351880	2354600	After all, the genomic information is the same.
2354600	2356920	We didn't touch the genome, there's no editing here.
2357160	2358200	No trans genes.
2358200	2359800	You might think that it should go back to normal,
2359800	2360760	but in fact, it doesn't.
2360760	2362440	These animals continue to generate
2362440	2364520	two-headed animals in perpetuity.
2364520	2366360	The first two-headed worms
2366360	2368680	caused by it induced by a different mechanism
2368680	2371320	were seen around 1903 by Thomas Hunt Morgan.
2372440	2374600	Between that time and 2009,
2374600	2376600	nobody had recut them to our knowledge
2376600	2378120	because it seemed completely obvious
2378120	2378760	of what would happen.
2378760	2380120	The genetics are unchanged, of course,
2380120	2381000	it'll go back to normal.
2381000	2382120	Why would you recut them?
2382120	2384280	And only this, and so the reason I mentioned this
2384280	2386600	is because the conceptual part matters.
2386680	2389560	It defines what experiments you are going to do,
2389560	2390600	the way you think about this,
2390600	2393320	and whether you think of genetics as specifying
2393320	2395080	in a hardwired way what the outcome is
2395080	2397800	versus as a kind of reprogrammable medium
2397800	2398520	where you might say,
2398520	2400280	I wonder if the memory has been reprogrammed
2400280	2401560	and in fact, that's what happens here.
2402200	2403880	So this has all the properties of memory,
2403880	2406200	it's long-term stable, it's rewritable,
2406200	2408360	it has conditional recall, which I just showed you,
2408360	2411800	and here are these two-headed animals hanging out.
2411800	2414440	Not only can you make animals with the wrong number of heads,
2414440	2416520	but you can make this way animals with heads
2416520	2417800	from other species.
2417800	2421320	So this is a triangular-headed dugezia doradoscephala,
2421320	2424120	you cut off the head, perturb the bioelectric circuit,
2424120	2426920	and you can end up with flat heads like a Pifolina,
2426920	2429480	you can end up with round heads like an S-Mediterrania,
2429480	2430760	or of course, the normal heads.
2431400	2432200	Not just the head shape,
2432200	2433880	but the distribution of stem cells,
2433880	2437720	the shape of the brain, and so these other species
2437720	2440440	sit in these attractors in the state space,
2440440	2442760	in the anatomical space, state space naturally,
2443400	2446600	but you can convince this hardware to visit those regions.
2446600	2448200	Without any genetic reprogramming,
2448200	2450520	the exact same normal hardware can actually visit
2450520	2453320	those other regions of anatomical state space.
2453320	2455320	Now, you can go well beyond that,
2455320	2458120	and we've made these kind of crazy, spiky shape things,
2458120	2460920	these cylinders, this is not even a flat like a planarian,
2460920	2463160	it's supposed to be combination forms.
2463160	2464840	And so now we have to start thinking about
2464840	2467400	what is the space of possibilities for these?
2467400	2468440	In developmental biology,
2468440	2470760	we hear a lot about developmental constraints,
2470760	2473320	as if there were things that cells cannot build.
2473320	2476360	We actually have no idea what cells can and cannot build.
2476360	2479240	So let's just take a look at this simple fact
2479240	2481560	that we are not the only bioengineers.
2481560	2483720	So here's a cool plant example,
2483720	2485480	I'm obsessed with these gauze lately,
2485480	2488760	but this is what the acorn normally builds.
2488760	2490200	Okay, so this is the oak leaf,
2490200	2492200	and if all you look at is this,
2492200	2495000	you will get the idea that this is incredibly reliable,
2495000	2498360	and that what the oak genome does is specify this,
2498360	2499640	this is what it can do.
2499640	2501080	But along comes a parasite,
2501080	2503320	this is a wasp of a particular type,
2503320	2505560	and the wasp is an interesting bioengineer.
2505560	2507560	What it has, the lineage of the wasp,
2507560	2508520	not the individual wasps,
2508520	2510760	but the evolutionary lineage has learned
2511480	2513480	is how to prompt these cells,
2513480	2515960	perfectly normal, not genetically edited cells,
2515960	2517800	to build something completely different.
2517800	2520360	This big round, bitey, red, and yellow thing
2520360	2521800	is made of these cells,
2521800	2524840	okay, because they were prompted by this bioengineer.
2524840	2526520	Would we have any clue that these cells
2526520	2528200	are capable of building something like this?
2528280	2529960	We'd have no idea if we didn't already see
2529960	2531160	that this was here.
2531160	2532680	So we have to understand now
2532680	2536920	that the reliability of hereditary is really deceiving,
2536920	2539560	because it keeps us from realizing
2539560	2541240	what the space of possibilities are,
2541960	2544440	and that bioprompting in this way
2544440	2546120	is actually really powerful,
2546120	2547640	and can let you do things
2547640	2549160	that micromanagement cannot let you do.
2549160	2550360	So when our group were trying
2550360	2552120	for this kind of full stack approach,
2552120	2553880	where you start with a molecular biology
2553880	2556360	that tells you which ion channels are present,
2556360	2558520	and then bioelectric simulators
2558520	2560760	to understand tissue level bioelectric patterns
2560760	2561880	and where they come from,
2561880	2564200	and then dynamic properties of these patterns,
2564200	2566120	if we cut the animal, do they rescale,
2566120	2568040	do they restore, do they have memory,
2568040	2569560	do they have plasticity,
2569560	2572920	and from there to basically algorithmic models
2572920	2575480	of how large scale anatomical decisions
2575480	2577000	are going to be made.
2577000	2579160	And once you have some of those models in hand,
2579160	2581560	you can do rational interventions.
2581560	2583560	So this is a normal frog brain,
2583560	2585480	forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain,
2585560	2587560	and under a variety of teratogens,
2587560	2589400	this can be messed up.
2589400	2590520	So for example, from nicotine,
2590520	2591880	you can see the difference here
2591880	2593240	between this brain and this.
2593240	2594440	And so we asked, okay,
2594440	2597240	is there any hope that using this bioelectrical information,
2597240	2600520	we can actually restore something as complex as this?
2600520	2601800	You might think that what you'd have to do
2601800	2603400	is tattoo every single cell
2603400	2604680	with the appropriate information
2604680	2607240	to get back into this very specific pattern.
2607240	2609320	So we made a computational model.
2609320	2613320	This is Alexis Pytaka and Baipav Pai in my group did this,
2613320	2615160	and they made this model and they asked,
2615160	2617160	okay, under a scenario like this,
2617160	2618360	when things have gone wrong,
2618360	2620280	what can we do to the bioelectrical gradient
2620280	2621480	to get back to normal?
2621480	2623240	And the model actually suggested
2623240	2624680	one particular ion channel,
2624680	2626360	which is called the HCN2,
2626360	2628280	and that channel has some really interesting properties
2628280	2629640	that I don't have time to get into here,
2629640	2631400	but one of the things it does
2631400	2634920	is restore sharp bioelectrical patterns,
2634920	2638200	it restore borders between adjacent compartments.
2638200	2642600	And what that does is able to repair even genetic defects.
2642600	2644200	So here's a normal brain.
2644200	2645480	Here's the brain of a tadpole
2645480	2647400	with a dominant notch mutant.
2647400	2648920	So you can see the forebrain is gone,
2648920	2651000	the midbrain and hindbrain are a big bubble.
2651000	2652440	And even on that background,
2652440	2656280	if you also give it either HCN2 RNA
2656280	2658520	or a couple of human-approved drugs
2658520	2660520	that are HCN2 openers,
2660520	2663080	these animals will end up with a normal brain structure,
2663080	2665880	normal brain gene expression, and normal IQs.
2665880	2667160	If you test them on learning rates,
2667160	2669000	they're indistinguishable from controls.
2669000	2671960	So I'm not arguing that we can always fix genetic errors,
2671960	2676120	but in some cases, you can fix hardware defects in software.
2676120	2677800	So an exposure of this animal
2677800	2680440	with a really powerful notch mutation
2680440	2683320	to a drug that was picked by a computational platform
2683320	2685720	restores a complex organ.
2685720	2689240	So the future, as we see, is a workflow like this
2689240	2692440	where there's a bunch of information of health and disease.
2692440	2695000	And these data, by the way, are not available.
2695000	2698760	We're just gearing up now to let this kind of physiology
2698760	2701240	catch up to the omics kind of a data sets
2701240	2703240	that exist for protein and RNA.
2703240	2707480	And then we can ask which kinds of ion flow states
2707480	2709000	would restore the correct pattern.
2709000	2711080	And then it becomes fairly straightforward
2711080	2712440	to find drugs that will do that.
2712440	2713480	And so you can play with this.
2713480	2715960	The early version of that platform is here.
2715960	2718120	Okay, so I'm just going to wrap up
2718120	2720280	by saying a couple of big picture things.
2721080	2723640	We know that both evolution and development
2723640	2726280	have scaled what they've fundamentally done
2726280	2728360	is scaled the size of goals.
2728440	2731880	So these little tiny creatures, microbes, and single cells
2731880	2733320	have little tiny goals.
2733320	2736360	They're cognitive light cones or the size of the goals
2736360	2738760	that they're able to produce and work towards
2738760	2740760	are basically right around the size of themselves.
2740760	2742280	They don't care what happens in the environment.
2742280	2745880	They just care about the internal physiological states.
2746440	2748360	But here, in this kind of system,
2748920	2751560	their tiny little goals have been inflated
2751560	2753960	towards a very grandiose construction project,
2753960	2755080	making a whole limb.
2755080	2757640	We know it's a goal because if you deviate them from that goal,
2757640	2758920	they will work very hard.
2758920	2761080	They will spend all kinds of energy to rebuild.
2761080	2763080	And when they reach that goal, they stop.
2763080	2765960	And so now, whereas here, there are tiny little goals
2765960	2768280	and physiological and transcriptional state space,
2768280	2771480	here you have much larger goals and anatomical state space.
2771480	2774920	But that amazing set of mechanisms,
2775560	2777720	which we can talk about if people have questions,
2777720	2780840	the set of mechanisms that allow the scaling of goals
2780840	2782520	has a failure mode.
2782520	2783800	That failure mode is cancer.
2783800	2785400	So this is glioblastoma.
2785480	2788280	Individual cells can disconnect from the electrical network.
2788280	2791160	And at that point, they roll back to be amoebas.
2791160	2792760	They are not more selfish.
2792760	2795480	It's just that their cells are smaller, quite literally.
2795480	2797240	The self here is very large.
2797240	2799000	This is the kind of goals that it can pursue.
2799000	2802120	These are tiny little cells here looking out for themselves.
2803480	2807320	So we have developed ways to not only detect this process early,
2807320	2810280	so this is hopefully a diagnostic modality for the future,
2810280	2812040	but also to suppress it.
2812040	2813640	Because instead of killing these cells,
2813720	2815800	so this is the same animal here.
2815800	2819240	This tapo is injected with a nasty human oncogene,
2819240	2823000	for example, a P53 mutation or a KRAS or something.
2823000	2825640	And the oncoprotein is very strongly expressed.
2825640	2826840	In fact, it's all over the place here.
2826840	2827960	It's labeled it.
2827960	2829240	But there is no tumor.
2829240	2831560	And that's because we co-injected an ion channel
2831560	2834600	that forces these cells to stay in electrical communication
2834600	2835400	with their neighbors.
2835400	2836120	That's it.
2836120	2838200	We don't regulate any of the other processes.
2838200	2840760	We just reconnect it to the large-scale network
2840760	2843240	that remembers that you should be working on the skin
2843240	2846360	and muscle and things like that and not making a tumor.
2846360	2850200	That means that we can think about next-generation biomedicine
2850200	2854360	from the perspective of the protocognitive capacity
2854360	2856920	of the material that we are trying to repair.
2856920	2858680	So not just micromanagement,
2858680	2861880	but actually all the way through the scales of the system,
2861880	2864600	perhaps guided by our computational platforms
2864600	2867080	and various AI wrappers on top of that,
2867080	2870920	we can ask, what is the most efficient interaction interface?
2870920	2873720	And I think biology and evolution work so well
2873720	2875960	precisely because they don't micromanage.
2875960	2879400	Evolution makes problem-solving machines at multiple scales
2879400	2881560	and it is hacking at every level.
2881560	2885160	Every cell is trying to hack every other cell and tissues.
2885800	2887800	And they're all trying to hack themselves, by the way,
2887800	2890360	to get them to do adaptive things
2890360	2892680	despite the various problems in the environment.
2892680	2894840	And so that means that we can take advantage of this.
2894840	2897320	All of this stuff, the ability to sense,
2897320	2899880	to amplify signals, to generalize, to discriminate,
2899880	2902280	learn, and ultimately solve problems.
2902280	2904680	Instead of building them from scratch ourselves,
2904680	2906440	as we now do with robotics,
2906440	2909160	we can take advantage of a billion years
2909160	2912600	of optimizing these kind of capacities.
2912600	2915000	And so we can think, now let's think about something else.
2915000	2916600	Not only is our target,
2916600	2918360	so the patient or the bioengineer tissue,
2918360	2923000	not only is our target somewhat up here in the spectrum,
2923000	2925240	but actually our intervention could be too.
2925240	2926280	Right now we use drugs.
2926280	2929240	Drugs, for the most part, are extremely dumb.
2929240	2930600	They are very simple machines.
2930600	2931960	They only do the one thing they do.
2931960	2934120	They bind whatever targets they're going to bind,
2934120	2935160	and that's it.
2935160	2936600	And that's very limiting.
2936600	2938120	Some kind of smart intervention.
2938120	2940520	And yes, it could be an implanted piece of engineering,
2940520	2942440	like a smart insulin pump or something like that.
2942440	2944760	But here's a different way to think about it.
2944760	2946920	So let's take a look at this thing.
2946920	2948280	So here it is running around.
2948280	2950440	If I were to ask you what that was,
2950440	2952120	you might say that this is,
2952120	2953880	we got this from a pond somewhere,
2953880	2956360	a primitive organism from the bottom of a lake.
2956360	2958200	And if you were to sequence the genome,
2958200	2959480	you would find out something pretty well.
2959480	2961720	The genome is 100% homo sapiens.
2963000	2964520	Okay, what you're looking at here
2964520	2966440	is something we call an anthrobot.
2966440	2969480	It's a new, it's the next version of arzenobots,
2969480	2973080	which are biological, self-multile biological constructs
2973080	2973800	made from frog cells.
2973800	2975640	These are made from human patient cells.
2975640	2977720	There is no genetic modification here.
2977720	2979240	There are no weird nanomaterials.
2979240	2981960	There is no trans genes, no circuits.
2981960	2984600	So far, we can add all those things and we will as needed.
2984600	2987880	But for now, we're really interested in the baseline
2987960	2989320	competencies, the plasticity.
2989320	2990520	And so there's a protocol
2990520	2993240	that causes these little guys to develop up here.
2993240	2995400	They start to, they're basically lung organoids,
2995400	2997640	and then they, we get them to turn inside out.
2997640	2999720	And then you see what they really do
2999720	3001960	when your lung epithelium gets to reboot
3001960	3004280	its multicellularity and have a new life.
3004280	3006600	And so they become these highly multi-little creatures
3006600	3008360	that have all kinds of capacities.
3008360	3010280	Here's one navigating a scratch
3010280	3011880	through a bunch of neural tissue.
3011880	3013240	So all this gray stuff out here
3013240	3016920	is IPSC-derived human neural tissue.
3016920	3019160	It's a lawn and we made this scratch through it
3019160	3020520	and you could see it moving.
3020520	3022360	Now, it's moving through this.
3022360	3023560	What might be the interactions
3023560	3025960	between the amphibot and this tissue here?
3025960	3027480	If you let a bunch of them settle down,
3027480	3029480	we call this a super bot or a bridge bot,
3030280	3031640	because there's a bunch of them together.
3031640	3032680	If you let them settle down,
3032680	3034680	what you find is that over about four days,
3034680	3036520	what they do is they knit the two sides
3036520	3038200	of the wound together.
3038200	3039480	And this is what it looks like.
3039480	3040920	Now, whoever would have thought
3040920	3043160	that your tracheal cell sitting quietly
3043160	3046840	in your lungs and in your trachea for decades,
3047160	3049400	that given a new environment,
3049400	3052840	they would be able to reboot their multi-cellularity
3052840	3055160	in a way that not only lets them move around
3055160	3056280	and do other interesting things,
3056280	3059160	but actually exert healing capacity on your other cells.
3059160	3060920	Your tracheal cells have the capacity
3060920	3062840	to fix peripheral innervation.
3062840	3064040	What else do they know how to do?
3064040	3064840	We have no idea.
3064840	3066360	This was the first thing we tried.
3066360	3068040	This was not test number 78
3068040	3069720	out of a thousand different things we tried.
3069720	3070680	This was the first thing.
3070680	3071560	So I'm going to assume
3071560	3073080	that we're not just extremely lucky
3073080	3074600	to find the one thing that they know how to do.
3074600	3076600	There's actually a ton of capabilities here.
3076600	3077800	And the other interesting thing
3077800	3079800	is that as a kind of intervention,
3079800	3082120	something that might someday be personalized,
3082120	3083880	medicine bots made from your own cells
3083880	3084840	to go into your own body,
3084840	3086440	no immune suppression needed,
3086440	3089240	to do repairs, to clean out your arteries,
3089240	3091400	drop off the pro-regenerative molecules
3091400	3092520	as a million applications.
3093240	3095240	But the cool thing is that unlike,
3095240	3097240	let's say, nanorobotics or something else
3097240	3098760	where we build it directly,
3098760	3100920	these guys are your own cells.
3100920	3103000	They share all the priors with your body
3103000	3104280	about what health and diseases,
3104280	3106120	what inflammation is, what cancer is,
3106120	3106920	and so on.
3106920	3107720	And these are not things
3107720	3110200	we have to build into them from scratch.
3110200	3111640	So the last thing I want to say
3111640	3113080	is that moving forward,
3113080	3115160	the field of biomedical interventions,
3115160	3117160	this is what's currently on the table.
3117160	3118920	So these kind of bottom-up interventions
3118920	3120840	of surgery and stem cells and all this stuff.
3120840	3123880	But there's this whole other gigantic set
3123880	3125400	of approaches coming,
3125400	3126520	which are top-down,
3126520	3128840	which has to do with not only behavior shaping.
3128840	3129960	We haven't even talked about this,
3129960	3132840	but we have some really interesting approaches
3132840	3134520	to training cells and tissues.
3135160	3136440	And these are agential implants,
3136440	3139240	and then various kinds of morphosuticals
3139240	3141880	that speak to the anatomical intelligence.
3141880	3143480	And so these are just some examples
3143480	3144760	of what's actually coming.
3144760	3145480	So my guess is,
3145480	3146840	oh, and you can see the details
3146840	3147960	in these reviews.
3147960	3150520	So my guess is that future medicine
3150520	3153080	is going to look a lot more like psychiatry
3153080	3154600	than it's going to look like chemistry.
3154600	3156840	We are really talking about exploiting
3156840	3158680	the tools and the insights of neuroscience,
3158680	3160600	very deep insights of neuroscience
3160600	3161400	beyond neurons
3161400	3164040	to understand multi-scale intelligent systems.
3164040	3166120	And I think the ability to hack this
3166120	3169240	for transformative health applications is massive.
3169240	3170840	I will just thank all of the people
3170840	3173640	that are doing the work
3173640	3174920	that I mentioned here today,
3174920	3177000	the various postdocs and students.
3177000	3177960	All the technical support
3177960	3179640	are many amazing collaborators,
3179640	3181880	our funders who support this stuff.
3182760	3183640	Again, disclosures.
3183640	3185560	There's three companies that fund
3185560	3186840	some of this work here.
3186840	3188200	And Jeremy Gay,
3188200	3189640	who did a lot of the illustrations
3189640	3190600	that I just showed you,
3190600	3192840	and most of all, the animal model systems,
3192840	3195320	because they really have the hardest job of all here.
3195320	3197480	So I will stop here and answer questions.
3197480	3198040	Thank you so much.
3198600	3200920	That was another mindblower.
3200920	3202040	Thank you so much.
3202040	3203400	I know we're over time now,
3203400	3205160	but it would be difficult
3205160	3206920	to synthesize all of the questions from the chat.
3206920	3208040	Honestly, I have no,
3208040	3209640	I'm not even going to try to do this.
3209640	3211160	But I think for this group in particular,
3211160	3212840	perhaps what's most interesting
3212840	3214040	is if you were thinking about
3214040	3215800	what people in this group could do
3215800	3217560	to either improve work
3217560	3219880	on the more elliptaceutical notion
3219880	3220600	of what you mentioned,
3220600	3222760	or on the agenda implant notion
3222760	3223480	of what you mentioned,
3223480	3224680	like where do you think
3224680	3225800	are currently open challenges
3225800	3227160	where people like maybe come from
3227160	3229560	more of a biology aging background
3229560	3230600	can like most help,
3230600	3232440	or like how could they most help draw
3232440	3235400	these applications into the field?
3235400	3236680	What's outstanding there?
3236680	3237400	What's left to do?
3237960	3238760	Yeah, what's left to do?
3238760	3239640	There's a lot left to do,
3239640	3240920	but let's just talk about
3240920	3242360	the aging thing in particular.
3242360	3243800	So the theory of aging
3243800	3245960	that we have been playing with
3245960	3247240	is this idea that
3247240	3250120	if you think about anatomical homeostasis,
3251080	3253560	the need to continuously work
3253560	3254680	towards maintaining a shape,
3254680	3256360	that doesn't stop in adulthood.
3256360	3257560	Once you've built the body,
3257560	3259880	cells are dying and being reborn all the time,
3259880	3260520	it has to,
3260520	3261480	you have to work pretty hard
3261480	3262920	to stay in the same in one place.
3262920	3264760	So that morphostasis
3264760	3266280	is happening all the time.
3266280	3268600	But that requires having information
3268600	3270440	about what the body is supposed to look like.
3270440	3271800	If you're going to resist the drift
3271800	3272760	of noise and aging
3272760	3273880	and then cancer and so on,
3273880	3274840	it requires you to have
3274840	3277000	a crisp memory of the target morphology.
3277000	3278760	And could it be that during aging
3278760	3280120	that what happens is that
3280120	3281240	there's a degradation
3281240	3283720	of the target of morphology pattern memory?
3283720	3285400	Maybe the pattern memory gets fuzzy.
3285400	3287000	And we know when in development,
3287000	3287960	if we make it fuzzy,
3287960	3288680	development goes to,
3288680	3290040	how can you get birth defects
3290040	3291640	in adulthood if it gets fuzzy?
3291640	3294040	I think what that looks like is aging.
3294040	3295400	And so our approach currently
3295400	3296680	is to think about ways
3296680	3299880	to basically to sharpen that pattern
3299880	3301720	and to refine that information.
3301720	3304360	And so this means really developing
3304360	3306440	not only the conceptual tools around
3306520	3308840	aging as a defect of geometry,
3308840	3310280	not a fundamental bio count.
3310280	3311880	And of course, it might be multiple things.
3311880	3313800	I'm not saying this is the only useful model,
3313800	3315000	but to really develop
3315000	3316840	the conceptual apparatus around this
3316840	3319320	and then to build new tools.
3319320	3320120	So we need more,
3320760	3321800	but we need better ways
3321800	3323720	to do voltage imaging in vivo.
3323720	3325560	So there's a lot of technology development there.
3325560	3327720	We need all kinds of efforts
3327720	3330440	for better ion channel drugs,
3330440	3332120	better computational models.
3332120	3334760	Physiomics is huge as a huge need.
3334760	3335960	We simply do not know
3336680	3339000	what all the correct voltage states are
3339000	3340600	for health and disease in different organs
3340600	3341560	at different ages.
3341560	3343000	So acquiring that data set
3343000	3344840	is something that we are going to do.
3344840	3346120	It's very important.
3346120	3346920	It hasn't been done
3346920	3349480	because molecular biology and biochemistry,
3349480	3350920	they can work with dead tissue.
3350920	3352040	So you fractionate your cells,
3352040	3353640	you get your protein, your RNA, whatever,
3353640	3354440	and that's fine.
3354440	3355800	You can make a list of what you have.
3355800	3357320	Bioelectricity doesn't work that way.
3357880	3359880	As soon as the cell is dead,
3359880	3360600	this is gone.
3360600	3362440	You cannot do this in non-living tissue.
3362440	3364600	So all of this has to be in vivo
3364600	3365960	and it's quite difficult.
3365960	3368120	So those are just some of the challenges
3368120	3370040	that we're facing now.
3370040	3370440	All right.
3370440	3370760	Thanks.
3370760	3371160	I don't know.
3371160	3371960	Do you have to hop off?
3373640	3374520	I have till 2.15.
3374520	3375880	So I have another 10 minutes.
3375880	3376360	Okay.
3376360	3376680	Okay.
3376680	3377960	Then let me get with,
3377960	3378600	I think Micah,
3378600	3380120	your question was highly uploaded.
3380120	3382200	If you want to unmute your thoughts
3382200	3383640	on the long term,
3383640	3385080	I can also otherwise ask it.
3385640	3385960	Sure.
3385960	3386920	So I think you answered it,
3386920	3388040	but I was wondering if you can go
3388040	3389320	into a little more detail on
3390200	3391480	how do we get to a place
3391480	3395480	where we can image a living human
3395480	3397560	and read its bioelectrical state?
3397560	3398520	Like right now people are doing this
3398520	3399960	with brains and then they plug
3399960	3401320	the output into an AI
3401320	3403080	and the AI is now learning
3403080	3404920	how to interpret what that means.
3404920	3406360	Presumably we want to do the same thing
3406360	3408600	with the bioelectric network of the whole body.
3408600	3410360	What is the path to get there
3410360	3411960	technologically or like
3411960	3413080	what research needs to be done?
3413080	3415000	Very similar to the question Ellison asked.
3415720	3415960	Yeah.
3415960	3417640	The straightforward path
3417640	3419720	is going to be to develop.
3419720	3421640	So right now we have voltage sensitive dyes
3421640	3423560	that can give us the bioelectric state of cells
3423560	3424200	you can see,
3424200	3426120	but obviously the majority of the body
3426120	3427480	ourselves you cannot see.
3427480	3431800	So some kind of improved bioelectric re-imaging technology
3431800	3434920	that can let us read the state of deep tissues
3434920	3437800	and then of course the computational models
3437800	3439720	to go from the understanding
3439720	3441240	of the patterns of health and disease
3441240	3442680	to how to turn the disease ones
3442680	3443560	into the healthy ones.
3443560	3445160	That's the straightforward way.
3445160	3447960	I happen to think there's a shortcut
3447960	3449320	and I think the shortcut
3449320	3451320	is going to be around understanding
3451320	3453800	the higher level information processing
3454360	3455400	in these networks.
3455400	3457240	In other words, I really don't think in the end
3457240	3458520	we're going to be micromanaging
3458520	3459560	the bioelectric state
3459560	3461080	any more than I want to micromanage
3461080	3462360	of the molecular state.
3462360	3464840	I think it's going to be the equivalent
3464840	3467400	of what we do in behavior science.
3467400	3468680	If you have a rat
3468680	3470680	and you want them to do a little circus trick,
3470680	3472360	one way is to try to play the body
3472360	3474120	like a puppet and control every neuron
3474120	3475000	and try to get them to walk
3475000	3476040	and do the various things,
3476040	3478200	but the much easier way is to train the rat
3478200	3480520	because the rat offers this amazing interface
3480520	3481160	called learning,
3481160	3483000	which enables you to give rewards and punishments
3483000	3484120	and you don't have to know the details
3484120	3485560	of which neurons are doing what.
3485560	3487800	I think it's going to end up like this.
3487800	3489000	I think we're going to,
3489000	3491000	once we figure out what actual
3491000	3492520	protocognitive capacities
3492520	3493960	these electrical networks have,
3493960	3495160	we're going to develop a kind of
3496280	3497640	systematic training protocols
3497640	3499240	where you can give them stimuli
3499240	3500680	and it's not going to be about
3500680	3502200	knowing which cells have which voltage
3502200	3504120	is going to be a much higher level intervention,
3504120	3505800	but stay tuned about that.
3505800	3507160	We're still working that out.
3507160	3509080	We have Ben Moskowitz next.
3509080	3510120	Hey, sorry.
3511160	3512120	Sorry about that.
3512120	3513720	I was wondering if,
3513720	3514840	I guess like what we're just saying
3514840	3516680	about like the brain dynamics of
3517720	3519480	being able to read the state
3519480	3522200	and then be more predictive from experimentation,
3523720	3524920	like for the plan area
3525480	3528440	to be able to modify their head generation
3528440	3529560	to be able to say two heads,
3529560	3530600	four heads, something like this
3530600	3531400	and the construction,
3532680	3534280	you need to be able to manipulate
3534280	3535400	the electrical networks
3536120	3537160	to guide the cells
3537160	3538680	like towards that goal that you want.
3539240	3541640	So do you have a systematic way
3541640	3543640	to approach that problem currently?
3544680	3546760	Or is it mostly through experimentation
3546760	3549320	and like once we collect the larger data set,
3549320	3550440	it'll be able to be much more
3551000	3552680	like AI driven or something like that?
3553320	3554840	Yeah, up until now,
3554840	3556760	the only path that we've had
3556760	3559320	is to observe natural patterns
3559320	3560440	and try to infer.
3560440	3561400	So if you want to know
3561400	3563000	what bioelectric pattern kicks off,
3563000	3563880	eye development,
3563880	3566120	when you look early on in the embryo
3566120	3567320	before the eye comes up and that,
3567320	3568440	oh, wow, there's an eye spot
3568440	3569960	and that's the pattern that kicks it off.
3569960	3571080	You can do the same for limb.
3571080	3572440	You can do the same for the brain.
3572440	3573720	So we've now done it in,
3573720	3574040	I don't know,
3574040	3575800	half a dozen different contexts.
3575800	3577720	It's extremely difficult
3577720	3579080	and time consuming.
3579080	3580760	And I am hoping
3580760	3582840	and we're working on some of this
3582840	3585960	to develop automated robot scientist platforms
3585960	3588360	that together with improved bioelectric
3589640	3591320	characterization machinery,
3591320	3592120	better dyes,
3592120	3593720	maybe CAT scan reagents
3593720	3595560	and so on that are voltage sensitive.
3595560	3597000	We can automate that process,
3597000	3598040	make it high throughput
3598040	3599640	and really then from there,
3599720	3602760	use AI and maybe conventional analysis tools
3602760	3604280	to extract an understanding
3604280	3605240	of the bioelectric code.
3605240	3607480	That's what we call is cracking the bioelectric code.
3607480	3608200	For now,
3608200	3610440	our number of examples is quite low
3610440	3612600	and so all we can do is look at
3612600	3613400	normal embryos,
3613400	3614360	normal regeneration,
3614360	3616280	normal tumor genesis
3616280	3617720	and try to learn from that.
3617720	3618680	But I think ultimately
3618680	3620280	we would like to scan the whole
3620280	3621000	many species,
3621000	3621960	many different ages,
3621960	3623400	many different disease conditions
3623400	3624120	and from that,
3624120	3625880	figure out what actually the encoding
3625880	3627240	is top to bottom.
3627240	3627960	That's ambitious.
3627960	3629080	Okay, Shruti, you next.
3630200	3631800	Hi, it was an amazing talk.
3631800	3633240	Thank you so much, Michael.
3633240	3635160	I was wondering what else are we missing?
3635160	3637320	Bioelectricity is of course one aspect,
3637320	3640360	but also there must be other forces,
3640360	3640680	right,
3640680	3642920	electromagnetic dissonant light waves,
3643480	3644680	sound waves,
3644680	3646360	some weak UQ forces.
3646360	3647800	I'm not able to sync all of them,
3647800	3650280	but like all of these exist in nature
3650280	3652760	and I'm sure they must exist in the body as well.
3653400	3656440	Are there any labs that are working on this
3656440	3657720	or tools that are
3658680	3660760	resistant to even stark testing these things?
3661720	3663000	Yeah, yeah, that's a great question.
3663000	3665320	And we think about this stuff all the time
3665320	3667640	and I encourage my students
3667640	3669080	and postdocs to ask,
3669080	3670280	what would we be missing?
3670280	3671240	Using the approaches
3671240	3671960	and more importantly,
3671960	3673960	the conceptual tools that we have,
3673960	3675800	what would they absolutely not see?
3675800	3677320	And so you got your known unknowns
3677320	3678280	and your unknown unknowns.
3678280	3680040	So I can't say anything about the unknown unknowns,
3680040	3681080	but for the known unknowns,
3681080	3681960	there's a few things.
3681960	3684520	So we know that we really don't understand yet
3684520	3687080	the phenomenon of mitogenic radiation,
3687080	3688680	so ultra weak photon emission.
3688680	3690680	So there are some good labs that work on this.
3690680	3692920	Cells are exchanging light
3692920	3695080	and other kinds of electromagnetic radiation
3695080	3695560	with each other.
3695560	3697320	We don't know what it does.
3697320	3698680	We don't have good tools for it,
3698680	3700440	but I'm going to guess
3700440	3702040	that it's probably quite important.
3702040	3703640	There may be sound,
3703640	3706040	vibratory kind of things that happen.
3706040	3708760	The nuclear envelope has an electrical potential across it.
3708760	3710520	We haven't even begun to scratch
3710520	3712280	what implications that might have
3712280	3713560	for gene expression.
3714200	3715480	In fact, all the organelles have,
3715480	3717720	all the membrane bound organelles have voltages.
3717720	3719880	So yeah, biophysics is,
3719880	3721880	I'm sure has tons of surprises for us.
3721880	3723720	In fact, we can go in the opposite direction
3723720	3725800	instead of looking down into these organelles,
3725800	3726760	like we found recently
3726760	3728680	that actually embryos talk to each other.
3728680	3729480	So whole embryo,
3729480	3731240	so groups of embryos make a,
3731240	3732760	what I call a hyper embryo,
3732760	3735160	where the whole large collections of embryos
3735160	3737800	can solve problems that individual embryos cannot.
3737800	3740440	And they have their own gene expression profiles
3740440	3742840	that small groups of embryos don't have and so on.
3742840	3745160	So there are many surprises here.
3745160	3746680	And yeah, some of these are being studied
3746680	3747800	and some we don't need to know about.
3749000	3750520	Okay, maybe we have time for one more for you.
3750520	3752040	Now, you had the idea in that phone on time,
3752040	3752920	if you want to go for it.
3754440	3755080	Sure, yes.
3755080	3756120	Thank you, Tricia.
3756120	3757240	Talk as usual, Mike.
3757240	3758040	Thank you.
3758040	3760760	Just, I'm trying to get my head around this.
3760760	3763000	When you reconstitute an eye,
3763000	3764360	let's say in the plant area,
3765320	3769080	you're setting up some bioelectric pattern
3769080	3770360	and you said you're changing
3771320	3774920	the ion channel states of a few cells
3774920	3776840	and then they communicate to the other
3776840	3778200	surrounding cells, right?
3778200	3779000	Something like that.
3779000	3781160	I'm probably watching this up.
3781160	3782120	So I'm just curious,
3783160	3784200	when you do that,
3784200	3787160	do you have to target specific cells
3787160	3791000	and how many cells do you actually manipulate
3791000	3792440	and then how many other cells
3792440	3794600	do they have to interact with?
3794600	3795880	Yeah, it's a great question.
3795880	3797160	It depends on the scenario.
3797160	3798040	So for example,
3798040	3799480	we have one scenario where
3799560	3802040	we can induce melanoma in these tadpoles
3802040	3803480	without any kind of genetic damage,
3803480	3804120	no oncogenes,
3804120	3806520	just by disrupting the electrical communication.
3806520	3808120	That takes about three cells.
3808120	3810120	That only takes about three cells to do that.
3810120	3811000	In the case of the eye,
3811000	3812200	it's actually quite interesting
3812200	3814360	because when you establish these cells
3814360	3815240	that want to be eye,
3815800	3817560	all of their neighbors are telling them,
3817560	3819240	you're wrong, you should be skinned.
3819240	3821080	And they have this debate back and forth
3821080	3821720	and we can see it.
3821720	3822760	We can literally see it
3822760	3823960	because if you,
3823960	3825880	I had this experience right from the beginning,
3825880	3826680	I tried to,
3826680	3829000	I wanted to make the whole embryo one giant eye.
3829000	3832200	Okay, so I just wanted to turn every cell into an eye.
3832200	3836040	So I shot it up with a ton of this potassium channel RNA
3836040	3837320	and you look at the embryos
3837320	3839240	and I was using a transgenic
3839240	3840760	that is actually glows
3840760	3842680	where the master eye gene is turned on.
3842680	3843560	So I look at this thing
3843560	3845240	and I see seven spots as I cool.
3845240	3846840	This tadpole is going to have seven eyes.
3846840	3848120	And then you look the next day
3848120	3849400	and it's, oh wait, it's only four.
3849400	3850760	And the next day, wait, it's only two.
3850760	3852440	And the next day, you're lucky if you get one.
3852440	3853720	So what's happening is that
3853720	3854520	all the other cells,
3854520	3855480	this one cell is saying,
3855480	3856280	let's build an eye
3856280	3857080	and all the others are saying,
3857080	3858120	you're crazy, we're skinned.
3858120	3859560	And depending on who wins,
3859560	3861000	they have this back and forth interaction
3861000	3861880	depending on who wins.
3861880	3863400	And it's a cancer suppression mechanism.
3863400	3864520	You don't want a lot of cells
3864520	3866200	with weird voltages around.
3866200	3866840	So in that case,
3866840	3868040	it actually, there is a threshold.
3868040	3869240	I don't have an exact number for you,
3869240	3871160	but there is a threshold where
3871160	3872760	if you're not in that threshold,
3872760	3874920	the other cells are going to wipe out
3874920	3876280	what you're trying to do.
3876280	3877240	Mike, thank you so much.
3877240	3878520	I know we've kept you one minute over.
3878520	3879480	I remind you of your time.
3879480	3881560	This was absolutely mind-boggling as usual.
3881560	3883640	I can't wait to have you back whenever you're ready.
3883640	3883960	Any time.
3883960	3885400	Thanks everyone for your great questions.
3885400	3886760	This was absolutely fantastic.
3886760	3887240	Thank you.
3887240	3888200	I see you for the next one.
3888200	3888760	Thank you, Shanky.
3888760	3889320	Thank you.
3889320	3889880	Thank you so much.
3889880	3890600	Thank you, everybody.
3890600	3890840	Yeah.
3890840	3892440	Anytime we can have an in-depth talk
3892440	3893800	about bot staging with everyone.
3893800	3895160	So thanks, everyone.
