00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Welcome, everyone, to Fossett's biotech seminar series.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,280
Really excited to have Michael Levin here again.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,160
I discovered your work, I think, about five years ago

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,960
in one of your New Europe's presentations

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,440
on what bodies think about.

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,760
Was totally startled by it.

7
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,840
Could not believe what you were discussing there

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,360
until we had you on, I think, two or three years ago,

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,480
for Fossett's seminar a while back.

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,200
Also, I think the topic was taming

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,720
the collective intelligence of self

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,440
with a focus also on possible regeneration

13
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,840
and longevity implications.

14
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,240
Since then, I have contacted you quite a few times

15
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,680
to ask if you want to nominate Fossett,

16
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,440
because we really want to explore a little bit more

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,640
the longevity and, like, bio-angle of much of your work.

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,280
Since then, you have not stopped working.

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,480
In fact, quite the opposite.

20
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,720
You have now produced some really mind-boggling bits

21
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,080
on Xenobots and Amphobots ever since.

22
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,200
And so hopefully, we may get into some of that

23
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,480
also during the Q&A.

24
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,760
And then most recently, you were on a cognitive revolution

25
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,480
podcast and discussed some of the implications of your work

26
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,680
for AI, and especially for a new and bio-inspired approach

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,560
to intelligence.

28
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,040
That was really interesting.

29
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,600
We have launched our AI safety grant since then.

30
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,960
And many, not many, but a few of the applications

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,560
actually actively referenced your work in the AI applications.

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,800
So I'm just really excited to discuss, hopefully, some

33
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,880
of these things in the Q&A.

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,640
But for now, please take it away.

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,760
Thank you so much for joining.

36
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,520
Today, are you discussing indulgence

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,360
in bio-electrical networks and interface

38
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,800
to regenerative medicine?

39
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,880
And hopefully, we can tease out some of the longevity

40
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,120
implications and some of the AI implications

41
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,080
afterwards in the Q&A.

42
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,240
Thanks a lot for joining.

43
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,560
We are big fans of your work.

44
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,200
And please take it away.

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,080
Thank you so much.

46
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,920
That's a very kind introduction.

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,800
Thank you so much for having me here.

48
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,080
I'm very excited to share some ideas with you.

49
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,240
And what I'd like to talk to you about

50
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,440
is basically the following point.

51
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,200
That I'm going to make the argument

52
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,240
that bodies consist of a kind of multi-scale competency

53
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,280
architecture.

54
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,600
And the key element of this is that there's

55
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,640
problem-solving intelligence at every level,

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,640
from the molecular networks to organs and swarms and so on.

57
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,080
I'm going to make the argument that definitive regenerative

58
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,640
medicine is really going to require

59
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,920
us to exploit this collective intelligence.

60
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,920
What it amounts to is communicating

61
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,720
our anatomical goals in morphospace to the cells.

62
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,400
And the particular interface that we exploit

63
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,080
is the endogenous bio-electrical networks that

64
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,240
are present in all tissues.

65
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,400
This is an extremely tractable and powerful interface

66
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,640
for top-down control.

67
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,960
And I'm going to show you the tools

68
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,840
that we've made to read and write the pattern memories

69
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,800
into what is basically the protocognitive medium

70
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,040
of the collective intelligence of cells.

71
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,200
I'm going to show you some beginning applications

72
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,000
in areas like birth defects, regenerative repair, cancer.

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And we can talk about how these are heading towards biomedicine.

74
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,360
So in order to heal and restore function,

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,880
we really need to understand the agential material

76
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,880
we're working with because it's completely

77
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,400
different than the kind of engineering

78
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,680
we've done in the past.

79
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,680
So for thousands of years, we worked with passive materials.

80
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,240
And the thing about passive materials

81
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,800
is that the only thing you can rely on them to do

82
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,720
is to stay where you put them.

83
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,440
And so it's on you as the engineer,

84
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,600
like with, let's say, Legos or wood or metal

85
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
to put them exactly where you want them.

86
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,200
And at best, they're going to remain there.

87
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,320
And you have to be the one to implement

88
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
all the different functionalities.

89
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,440
But engineers have increasingly started working on

90
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,520
with active matter and even computational materials.

91
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,920
And for us, bio-engineers and workers

92
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,360
in regenerative medicine, we work in agential material.

93
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,400
And you can imagine right away how different

94
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,840
that type of engineering is when you think about

95
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,480
what it takes to build a tower out of Legos

96
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,440
versus a tower out of dogs.

97
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,160
If you build a tower out of Legos, it's very straightforward.

98
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,560
You put everything where it goes.

99
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,840
But if that tower falls over, that's the end.

100
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,280
And you can't really expect it to do anything beyond that.

101
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,720
The dogs initially are absolutely not going to stay

102
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,520
where you put them, but they offer an amazing interface

103
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,200
having to do with training and memory and learning.

104
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,440
And if you train them to stand on top of each other,

105
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,440
then once you knock the tower over, they'll get back up

106
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,760
and they'll do the thing they're supposed to do.

107
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,520
And so you can see the pros and cons of this.

108
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,760
It requires you to really understand your material

109
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,560
to know which type of techniques you're going to use.

110
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,920
And people argue a lot about this notion

111
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,840
of whether bodies are actually machines,

112
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,520
if there's a difference between machines and organisms.

113
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,920
And I don't believe that these are absolute binary categories

114
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,160
in any way, but what we want is a plethora of approaches

115
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,000
at the right levels.

116
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,120
You definitely want an orthopedic surgeon

117
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,720
who believes your body is a machine

118
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,360
because they get to use tools like this.

119
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,040
They use chisels and screws and hammers and so on.

120
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,880
But what you don't want is a psychoanalyst

121
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,640
who thinks you're that kind of machine, right?

122
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,280
And so different types of problems

123
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,800
require different levels of solution.

124
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,440
And after the orthopedic surgeon does their thing,

125
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,600
they then send you home to heal.

126
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,240
And it is that part, the part that we don't micromanage,

127
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,960
that is the really interesting part

128
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,760
where the collective intelligence of the bodies

129
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,880
really takes hold.

130
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,680
And ultimately, we can discuss this at the end.

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
I won't get into it here,

132
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,120
but the people who work on placebo and nocebo effects

133
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,600
and so on, like Fabrizio Benedetti,

134
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,840
says words and drugs have the same mechanism of action.

135
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,000
And this is extremely deep

136
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,040
because what this is reminding us of

137
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,480
is that there is a multi-scale architecture

138
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,160
that has a language understanding at the top

139
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,720
and all kinds of other levels

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,160
eventually reaching the molecular level.

141
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,200
And our body is actually an amazing architecture

142
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,240
that lets your high level executive goals,

143
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,680
for example, social goals, scientific goals and so on,

144
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,720
to literally move calcium and other ions

145
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
across your membranes and your cells

146
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,160
so that you can walk and do voluntary motion

147
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,440
and go about your day to try to achieve those goals.

148
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,640
So our body has that kind of architecture

149
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,480
that literally links mental, long range mental goals

150
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,240
to the movement of chemicals

151
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,520
that allow you to enact those goals.

152
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,040
So across this, what I call the spectrum of persuadability

153
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,440
because it puts the emphasis on how we are going to use

154
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,680
different types of tools

155
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,200
to get the system to do various things.

156
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,280
Across that spectrum of persuadability,

157
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,960
we have many different waypoints.

158
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,320
You have simple machines, you have homeostats

159
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,640
and then you have learning agents

160
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,720
and then you have rational thinkers and planners and so on

161
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,040
and completely different sets of tools.

162
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,280
So hardware rewiring here and then cybernetics here

163
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,280
and maybe control theory and then behavioral science

164
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,600
and then maybe other interesting things

165
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,040
like psychiatry and so on.

166
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,640
So one might ask the question,

167
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,880
where do cellular collectives fit into this spectrum?

168
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,160
The assumption, and I think most people make this assumption

169
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,760
is that it's got to be somewhere here,

170
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,760
maybe a little bit here,

171
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,080
but I want to really emphasize the idea

172
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,720
that is very much an assumption.

173
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,640
That is a philosophical commitment.

174
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,040
The thing we need to do as scientists and engineers

175
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,880
is do experiments.

176
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,520
We need to find out where they fit

177
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,440
because my claim is that humans

178
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,600
are actually not very good at guessing these things.

179
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,960
So we need to do experiments

180
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,160
and that amounts to asking what tools in particular

181
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,040
the tools of these other disciplines

182
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,000
are really powerful in getting cellular collectives

183
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,680
to do interesting things.

184
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,720
Now, as we start to talk about intelligence,

185
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,880
it's important to work backwards.

186
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,560
So here we are, if we believe that we are high level

187
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,200
metacognitive beings with true goals and memories

188
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,400
and preferences and so on.

189
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,440
So here we are, where did all those things come from?

190
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,560
Working backwards, both evolutionarily and developmentally,

191
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
they came from here.

192
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,160
We were all once a single unfertilized OSI.

193
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,440
So people look at this cell

194
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,040
and they see a little blob of chemistry

195
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,240
and they say that really just obeys the laws of physics.

196
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,640
There is no cognition there.

197
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,040
But the deepest lesson of developmental biology

198
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,280
is that there is no magic lightning flash

199
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,640
during this process at which you go from being

200
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,120
quote unquote, just physics to having a complex mind.

201
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,640
So that means our goal,

202
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,240
and we all make this journey across

203
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,360
this so-called Cartesian cut.

204
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,000
So that means that our goal is to really understand

205
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,160
the scaling of minds.

206
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,040
We really need to understand how the primitive competencies

207
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,160
of molecular networks and single cells

208
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,400
slowly but surely become large scale competencies

209
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,320
in new problem spaces.

210
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,520
And this is something that I think Turing

211
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,920
actually understood quite well,

212
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
although he didn't talk about it much,

213
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,040
that the self assembly of the body

214
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,560
and the self assembly and the scale up of minds

215
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,880
is really the same problem.

216
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,600
This is why the father of computer science

217
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,160
who thought a lot about intelligence

218
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,240
and mathematics and thinking and so on

219
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,360
also had a paper on self-organization of chemicals

220
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,880
in an embryogenesis.

221
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,400
I think he was onto this.

222
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,560
This is the kind of stuff that we are made of.

223
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,520
This happens to be a free living organism,

224
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,160
but I just wanna show you, this is a lacrimaria.

225
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,200
I wanna show you what a single cell is capable of.

226
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,480
No brain, no nervous system.

227
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,280
Everything is handled in one cell.

228
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:37,080
So all of this animals, morphological, physiological,

229
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,920
anatomical, metabolic needs are handled within one cell.

230
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,400
And we have to ask ourselves the question

231
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,440
of what connection policies are there for beings

232
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,560
with their own agendas and their own competencies

233
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,080
to get together and do larger scale things.

234
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,440
Interestingly, intelligence does not appear first

235
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,640
in whole cells.

236
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,040
In fact, even gene regulatory networks,

237
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,520
and you can see the details in these papers,

238
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,320
even gene regulatory networks,

239
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,800
if you look at them correctly

240
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,920
or if you look at them the right way,

241
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,440
you can actually discover six different kinds of learning

242
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,400
that simple pathways can do.

243
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,480
So no need for cells, no need for plasma membranes

244
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,320
or any of that, just a small number of nodes

245
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,120
turning each other on and off is already sufficient

246
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,920
to do things like associative conditioning.

247
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,080
And that has massive implications for biomedicine,

248
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,680
which we can talk about.

249
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,840
So the first part of this talk,

250
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,920
I want to focus on the competencies of the material.

251
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,520
I wanna really drill down and show off

252
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,720
some of the amazing kinds of capabilities of the material

253
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,800
that we're dealing with because that bears on

254
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,600
what kind of technologies are possible.

255
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,360
Here's one example of the implications

256
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,960
of being made of this kind of material.

257
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,800
So this is a tappel of the frog,

258
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,880
you'll see a lot of those today.

259
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,520
So here are the nostrils, here's the mouth,

260
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,960
here's the brain, the gut.

261
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,440
What you'll notice is that we've prevented

262
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,400
the primary eyes from forming here,

263
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,360
but we put an eye on his tail.

264
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,360
And it turns out that these animals can see perfectly,

265
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
well, we test them in this machine that we built,

266
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,280
we built a custom machine to train

267
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,040
and test them on visual cues.

268
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,120
They can see because they can learn to perform

269
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,680
in these visual assays.

270
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,200
This ectopic eye does not connect to the brain,

271
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,120
it will often make us an optic nerve

272
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,880
that can connect and synapse on the spinal cord here.

273
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,720
So think about the amazing plasticity here,

274
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,040
without new generations of adaptation, selection,

275
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,520
this animal out of the gate

276
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,600
with a completely different sensory motor architecture,

277
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,800
that brain realizes that the information

278
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,240
being put onto its spinal cord

279
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,040
by this weird itchy patch of posterior tissue

280
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,520
is good enough to understand its world as visual data

281
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,800
and is able to process and behave accordingly.

282
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,240
That plasticity is a major theme here.

283
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,800
Another example of plasticity

284
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,600
that dissolves the distinction between memory

285
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,320
and body structure can be seen in planaria.

286
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,920
These flatworms, one of the main amazing characteristics

287
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,680
that they have is that they regenerate.

288
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,080
So you can cut them into pieces

289
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,160
and each piece will give rise to a complete worm.

290
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,240
So one thing that was known since the 60s

291
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,520
is that if you train them on a particular task,

292
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,960
for example, to look for food around these bumpy little,

293
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,600
these laser-etched little areas,

294
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,520
so place conditioning basically,

295
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,800
you cut off their head in their centralized brain,

296
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,720
the tail will sit there not doing anything

297
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,600
other than growing a brand new head

298
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,760
and a little bit more than a week later,

299
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
they've grown back in your head

300
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,280
and you find out that these animals remember perfectly well

301
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,080
where the liver was, which is what they eat.

302
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,200
What we see here is the amazing ability

303
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,280
to not only regenerate your memories,

304
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,520
but to imprint whatever information is present,

305
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,120
presumably in the rest of the body

306
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,960
so that we don't know yet where it is,

307
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,560
but to imprint that information

308
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,920
onto a newly growing brain.

309
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,480
So think about what that might mean

310
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,400
for future therapeutics when a patient

311
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,560
with six or seven decades of memories,

312
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,360
of personality, of history suddenly has a large chunk

313
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,240
of their brain replaced with the descendants of stem cells.

314
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,200
In terms of, are you still going to get the same,

315
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,920
the same individual?

316
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,720
Is it going to be more like a newborn baby?

317
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,600
What these kind of models suggest

318
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,440
that actually memories might persist quite well.

319
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,160
In fact, it's even more impressive what happens

320
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,160
in the caterpillar to butterfly transition.

321
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,360
These animals start out as a kind of two-dimensional,

322
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,720
it's a creature that lives in a two-dimensional world.

323
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,720
It crawls around and eats leaves

324
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,840
and it has a brain that's suitable for that.

325
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,960
Eventually it has to metamorphose

326
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,920
into a much different animal.

327
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,840
So this is like a soft-bodied robot.

328
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,320
It has no hard components.

329
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,400
This is completely different.

330
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,440
The movement types are entirely different.

331
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,040
This is a hard-bodied creature.

332
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,280
It flies in the 3D world, it drinks nectar.

333
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,640
And during this process, the brain is basically dissolved.

334
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,920
Most of the connections are broken.

335
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,440
Most of the cells are killed off.

336
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,080
A new brain is rebuilt.

337
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,120
But the remarkable part is not only do the butterflies

338
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,520
remember the training that the caterpillars received,

339
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,560
but actually they remap that training

340
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,120
with new salience onto a new body plant.

341
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,960
Because if you train these caterpillars to associate,

342
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,320
for example, a particular color stimulus with leaves,

343
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,960
what the butterfly doesn't care about leaves,

344
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,640
what the butterfly remembers is to go look for food

345
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,440
on those same color discs.

346
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,680
So that information is actually generalized,

347
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,040
not leaves, but food, the category food,

348
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,240
and remapped onto the new food,

349
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,800
more appropriate to the different body structure.

350
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,360
So this is not just a matter of where does the information

351
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,880
stay during brain remodeling.

352
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,960
That's the first question.

353
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,840
But the second question is,

354
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,280
how does that information get remapped

355
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,440
onto the new life of this individual?

356
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,920
And so you can think about what that means,

357
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,640
the ability to remap information onto new bodies.

358
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,880
Think human augmentation, new embodiments for future humans,

359
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,080
brain modification,

360
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,040
and how the information is going to persist.

361
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,840
So what we have, again, in biology

362
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,320
is this multi-scale architecture

363
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,800
where all the way from molecular networks,

364
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,600
all the way up, every layer is a problem-solving system.

365
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,560
They're not just structurally different size scales.

366
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,160
They actually have competencies to solve problems

367
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,720
in different spaces.

368
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,040
And there are multiple spaces that they operate in,

369
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,200
gene transcription spaces, a physiological state space.

370
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,720
We're going to spend most of the time talking

371
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,640
about this anatomical morpho space,

372
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,920
but just to remind us that,

373
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,280
to really be humble about this,

374
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,680
because we humans are okay

375
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,640
at recognizing the intelligence of medium-sized objects

376
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,200
moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space.

377
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,560
So crows and dogs and horses and maybe an octopus,

378
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,480
maybe a whale.

379
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,600
But we're really not very good

380
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,760
at recognizing intelligence in these other spaces

381
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,880
because all of our sense organs are very much aimed

382
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,920
at this kind of a one-narrow range of embodiments.

383
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,320
And I often like to think that if we had evolved

384
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,840
with a primary sensor of our blood chemistry

385
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,440
so that you can feel the blood chemistry,

386
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,520
the way that we currently see and hear and so on,

387
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,920
I think we would have no problem recognizing

388
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,880
that we live in a multi-dimensional space

389
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,200
and that our liver and our kidneys are, in fact,

390
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,320
intelligent agents that navigate that space adaptively

391
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,120
in terms of all the different things that happen to us.

392
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,000
So we're going to look at anatomical morpho space,

393
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,640
and which is basically just a multi-dimensional space

394
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,400
of all the different possible shapes

395
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,160
that something could undertake.

396
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,760
And we're gonna ask a basic question.

397
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,800
This is a cross-section through a human torso.

398
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,480
So look at this amazing order.

399
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,480
All these different organs are almost always

400
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,440
in the right shape, the right size, next to the right thing.

401
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,040
But we start out life like this,

402
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,200
a collection of embryonic blastomers.

403
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,800
Where does this pattern come from?

404
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,240
Where does it encode it?

405
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,440
And when I give this, I've given versions of this talk

406
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,960
to our middle school children,

407
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,560
and even the nine-year-olds immediately say,

408
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,520
oh, it's in the DNA.

409
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,360
They say it's in the genome.

410
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,240
But the thing is, we can sequence genomes now.

411
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,640
It was always clear, really, that this was not in the genome.

412
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,200
But a lot of scientists talk as if that's the case.

413
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,600
And now we know when you read the genome,

414
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,240
you don't see any of this, which is protein structure.

415
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,360
You see the description of the tiniest molecular hardware

416
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,560
that every cell gets to have.

417
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,080
You don't see directly information

418
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,000
about size, shape, symmetry type.

419
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,280
And so we need to understand how do these cells,

420
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
this genomically specified hardware,

421
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,040
how does it know what to build?

422
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,560
How does it know when to stop?

423
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,280
If something is missing, how do we convince it to rebuild?

424
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,280
And as engineers, we want to go one step further

425
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,960
and ask, what else could you build?

426
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,880
If we wanted to build something completely different

427
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
out of the same parts, could you?

428
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,680
Or all this talk of developmental constraints,

429
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,960
is that really a confining paradigm?

430
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,280
So let's think about what the future is supposed to look like.

431
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,720
What's the end game for this field?

432
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,120
I think that what we're talking about

433
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,680
is something we call an anatomical compiler.

434
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,320
So the idea is that someday you will sit down

435
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,960
in front of a software system and draw the plant, animal,

436
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,120
organ, or biobot that you want to build.

437
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,400
In this case, we've drawn a three-headed flatworm.

438
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,360
So having drawn the anatomy, the functional anatomy

439
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,200
that you want, what the system should be able to do

440
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,640
is compile that down to a set of stimuli

441
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,520
that could be given to cells to build that structure.

442
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,800
So not a 3D printer.

443
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,120
This is not about micromanaging where the cells go.

444
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,200
This is about convincing a group of cells

445
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
to build exactly what you want them to build

446
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,920
and not whatever it was that they were going to build before.

447
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,280
So two key questions first.

448
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,480
Why do we even need this thing?

449
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,120
Because not only for the understanding of evolution

450
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,160
and information and so on,

451
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,120
but very practically most biomedical problems.

452
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,840
So birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging,

453
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,640
degenerative disease, all of these things would go away

454
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,680
if we knew how to convince groups of cells to build

455
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,840
whatever organs we wanted them to build.

456
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,200
Now, the other question might be, why don't we have this yet?

457
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Genetics and molecular biology

458
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,440
has been going gangbusters for decades.

459
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,040
Why do we not have this thing yet?

460
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,080
I just want to illustrate one simple puzzle.

461
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,240
This is the axolotl larvae

462
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,400
and baby axolotls have little forelegs.

463
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,320
This is a tadpole of the frog.

464
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,880
At this stage, these guys do not have forelegs.

465
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,040
In my lab, we make something called a frogolotl.

466
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,160
So if we make a frogolotl,

467
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,000
it's got a bunch of embryonic cells from here,

468
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,600
a bunch of embryonic cells from here,

469
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,280
and you get a chimeric embryo.

470
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,400
Now, the axolotl genome is sequenced.

471
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,400
The frog genome has been sequenced.

472
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,360
Very simple question.

473
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,720
You've got both sequences.

474
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,240
Could you tell me whether a frogolotl

475
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,680
is going to have legs or not?

476
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,560
And the answer is no.

477
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,560
We have no way currently of knowing

478
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,080
the answer to these kind of questions.

479
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,600
In fact, if you didn't already know

480
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,520
what a tadpole or an axolotl looked like,

481
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,960
you couldn't even give me the shape of it

482
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,240
from looking at the genome.

483
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,120
It's very important to understand

484
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,480
what kind of information we have

485
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,240
and what kind of information we do not have.

486
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,600
So the state of the field currently is this.

487
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,400
We are very good at manipulating cells and molecules.

488
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,040
And all of the most exciting advances today

489
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,080
are about the hardware.

490
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,960
Everybody's really into genomic editing,

491
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,520
pathway remodeling, protein engineering.

492
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,720
All of these things are hardware.

493
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,640
They're focused at the molecular hardware level,

494
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,480
like where computer science was in the 40s and 50s.

495
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,640
So this is what programming used to look like.

496
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,200
She's physically rewiring this machine.

497
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,360
Now, the reason nowadays, when you're on your laptop

498
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,880
and you want to go from, I don't know,

499
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,040
PowerPoint to Microsoft Word,

500
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,720
the reason you don't get out your soldering iron

501
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,520
and start rewiring is because computer science

502
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,120
took advantage of something remarkable,

503
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,600
the fact that certain kinds of hardware

504
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,720
are reprogrammable and in fact can support

505
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,400
a layered, multi-scale, modular set of software,

506
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,640
or in our case, it's going to be physiology,

507
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,960
that allows you to do interesting things

508
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,120
with the exactly the same piece of hardware

509
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,160
without rewiring.

510
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,600
So this is what we're missing now.

511
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,320
But I'm going to argue that molecular medicine

512
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,280
is basically here.

513
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,680
I spoke to a major investor once who said that

514
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,800
in their firm, they think of biology today,

515
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,440
where computer science was in the year 2000.

516
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,360
And I think that's, that isn't as way wrong.

517
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,800
I think it's where we were in the 40s and 50s.

518
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,320
We can go a much higher than this.

519
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,920
And the thing that's still missing

520
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,000
is to understand the biological softwares,

521
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,440
to understand the intelligence

522
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,560
that we can take advantage of.

523
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,560
So when I say intelligence, what do I?

524
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,480
William James's nice definition,

525
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,720
which is the ability to reach the same goal

526
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,840
by different means.

527
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,440
It's a very cybernetic definition.

528
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,040
It doesn't talk about what kind of brain you have,

529
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,160
or whether you have a cortex,

530
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,560
or what space you're even working in.

531
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,320
Same goal by different means.

532
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,200
The ability to reach certain states in that space

533
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,920
when faced with interventions, when things change.

534
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,120
How much competency do you have to still get your job done?

535
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,440
So let's look, what kind of collective intelligence

536
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,360
can we find in cellular swarms?

537
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,760
What are the capabilities of our system

538
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,960
that we're trying to rewire?

539
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,560
What's the toolkit that we have?

540
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,200
This is one of my all-time favorite examples.

541
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,440
This is a cross-section through a kidney tubule of a nut,

542
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,000
and eight to 10 cells normally making this thing up.

543
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,640
One thing you can do to early embryos

544
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,640
is multiply the amount of DNA in their nuclei.

545
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,160
So if you can make a polyploid,

546
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,880
nutes that have two and four and six and so on.

547
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,200
If you do that, the cells become larger,

548
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,400
and you find out that,

549
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,240
actually, you still get the same size nut,

550
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,640
and that's because fewer cells get together

551
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,800
and make the same anatomical structure.

552
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,400
So amazing thing, number one,

553
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,960
is that you could have multiple copies of your genome

554
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,560
that doesn't seem to mess anything up.

555
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,600
Number two, you could have abnormally large cells,

556
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,560
and they still figure out

557
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,640
how many of them there need to be to do this.

558
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,240
But the most amazing thing

559
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,080
is that if you make the cells truly gigantic,

560
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,560
and I think this is maybe six and nutes.

561
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,160
If you make the cells truly gigantic,

562
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,640
what they will do is wrap around themselves

563
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,880
to give you the same anatomical structure.

564
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,320
And what's remarkable about that

565
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,240
is that this is a different molecular mechanism.

566
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,040
This is cell-to-cell communication and tubular genesis.

567
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,120
This is cytoskeletal bending.

568
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:19,640
And so in the service of a large-scale anatomical goal,

569
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,840
different molecular components are being called up.

570
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,120
Now, just think about what this means.

571
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,800
If you're a nude coming into the world,

572
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,000
what can you rely on?

573
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,080
We tend to think you've had eons of evolution,

574
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,480
you've had all this experience with your environment.

575
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,200
You can't count on how much DNA you have.

576
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,680
You can't count on how many copies of anything you have.

577
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,360
You can't count on your cell size.

578
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,520
You can't count on how many cells you have.

579
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,120
You have to be able to get your job done

580
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,000
despite massive variation in your own parts.

581
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
We don't have even the beginnings of technology

582
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,800
that has that kind of problem-solving competencies

583
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,760
and capacity.

584
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,800
This is a more familiar example.

585
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,720
We know that embryos reliably go from a single cell

586
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,560
to a complex organism,

587
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,160
but it's not a hardwired process.

588
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,320
It's reliable, but it isn't hardwired.

589
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,480
Because if you cut these embryos into pieces,

590
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,400
you do not end up with half bodies.

591
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,280
You end up with monozygotic twins and triplets.

592
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,320
So what happens is that from different starting positions,

593
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,040
and this is again called back to James' definition,

594
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,560
from different starting positions,

595
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,400
you can navigate that morpho space

596
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,880
and get to that same ensemble of goal states

597
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,680
that basically maps to a normal variation

598
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,200
around the human target morphology.

599
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,120
In many species, this is not just an embryonic thing.

600
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,400
For example, axolotls can regenerate their legs,

601
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,240
their eyes, their jaws, portions of their brain and heart,

602
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,600
spinal cord ovaries.

603
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,080
And what happens if they lose a limb anywhere along this axis,

604
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,200
they will rebuild exactly as much as needed,

605
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,720
whether from here or from here,

606
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,640
from different starting positions they get here.

607
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,960
And here's the most amazing thing about regeneration.

608
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,760
And everybody's excited about cranking up regeneration

609
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,520
for therapeutic purposes.

610
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,480
But actually the most amazing thing about regeneration

611
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,760
is that it stops.

612
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,920
How does it know when to stop?

613
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,800
It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed,

614
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,240
and that turns out to be very profound.

615
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,840
Now, it's not as if this is just for frogs

616
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,160
and salamanders and flatworms.

617
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,320
The human liver is highly regenerative,

618
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,840
even the ancient Greeks knew that.

619
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,280
I'm not sure how, but they did.

620
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,480
Human children regenerate their fingertips

621
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,680
below a certain age.

622
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,680
And deer, large adult mammals,

623
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,360
regenerate a centimeter and a half of new bone per day

624
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,120
when they're regrowing their antlers.

625
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,760
So massive amount of regeneration of bone,

626
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,680
vasculature, innervation, skin.

627
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,360
So the final example that I want to show you before

628
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,000
we go to the molecular mechanisms

629
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,920
is what happens to the frog face.

630
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,160
So this is a tadpole face, here are the eyes,

631
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,680
the nostrils, the mouth.

632
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,960
And here's what a frog looks like.

633
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,760
And so to go from a tadpole to a frog,

634
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,840
you need to rearrange the face.

635
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,680
These animals, the jaws will move forward,

636
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,760
the eyes move, everything moves around.

637
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,240
And it used to be thought that this was

638
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,840
a hardwired set of movements.

639
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,720
If you just somehow code for every organ

640
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,240
to move in that particular direction,

641
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,760
a particular amount,

642
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,000
then what will happen is you'll go from a normal tadpole

643
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,280
to a normal frog.

644
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,280
We decided to test this and to see actually

645
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,800
how much intelligence does this have,

646
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,200
and the way you test these things is with perturbations.

647
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,680
So what we did was we made a scrambled tadpole

648
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,760
called, we call them Picasso tadpoles,

649
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,280
where everything is in the wrong place.

650
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,440
The eyes on top of the head, the mouth is off to the side,

651
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,280
everything is just completely shuffled,

652
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,160
like a Mr. Potato Head doll scrambled around.

653
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,920
And what happens is that these animals

654
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,640
become quite normal frogs, actually,

655
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,760
because all of these different things

656
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,600
will move in normal paths,

657
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,080
in rather abnormal paths,

658
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,440
to get to where they need to go,

659
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,640
and then the movement stops.

660
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,280
So what the genetics gives you is not

661
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,640
a set of hardwired movements.

662
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,800
What the genetics actually specifies

663
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,800
is a machine that can execute an error minimization scheme.

664
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
It can continue to remodel

665
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,280
until certain conditions are met.

666
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,560
So those kind of data lead us to revise

667
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,800
the basic loop of developmental biology.

668
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,760
Normally what you have is there are genes acting

669
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,880
in gene regulatory networks,

670
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,720
they make some proteins that interact

671
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,880
by the laws of physics, all of this is in parallel,

672
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,960
and then this magical process of emergence

673
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,640
happens and complexity arises,

674
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,480
and then you have this beautiful organism.

675
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,720
This view, this is what is focused upon

676
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,240
in developmental biology textbooks,

677
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,600
is an open loop feed forward process

678
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,880
that rides along via emergence of complexity.

679
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,200
And it is certainly true that there are many systems

680
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,040
that will give you complexity

681
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,840
from the repeated application of simple rules.

682
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,640
There's plenty of that,

683
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,720
but that's not where the magic is here,

684
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,800
because what we find, which is a property

685
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,280
that is not shared by all the computational models

686
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,240
of feed forward emergence and complexity,

687
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,520
is that if you deviate from this target morphology,

688
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,720
and that can be with injury,

689
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,280
it can be with mutations, with teratogens.

690
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,720
In fact, one can propose that actually

691
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,040
this kind of anatomical homeostasis

692
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,080
and regenerative capacity was not about injury to start with.

693
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,160
The reason this evolution has this

694
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,520
is because this is how it was able to deal with mutations,

695
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,280
the fact that you know that in your lineage

696
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,240
you are going to experience changes of your internal parts.

697
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,440
And if you can't deal with that,

698
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,160
you're not going to live very long as a lineage.

699
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,400
So what happens when you deviate from this,

700
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,720
from this target morphology is that some mechanisms kick in

701
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,120
both at the level of physics and genetics

702
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,480
to try to reduce the error.

703
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,160
It's literally like a thermostat in your house.

704
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,200
It's an error minimization kind of process.

705
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Now, this is on the one hand,

706
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,360
biologists know all about homeostatic loops.

707
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,080
And of course, we recognize them in terms of pH regulation

708
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,680
and temperature and hunger and all that.

709
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,520
But there's a couple of unique things here.

710
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,280
One is that, first of all,

711
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,600
the set point of this homeostatic process

712
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,560
is not a single number.

713
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,520
It's not a scalar like for hunger or pH.

714
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,520
It's a some kind of simplified version

715
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,680
of a complex three-dimensional shape.

716
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,800
How could we possibly store shape in a group of cells

717
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,880
so that they know what they're supposed to build?

718
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,240
Now, how do we store this set point?

719
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,080
And then the other thing is that

720
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,880
in developmental biology and cell biology,

721
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,600
really discouraged from talking about goals

722
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,600
and those kinds of teleological models.

723
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,880
You're supposed to talk about chemistry

724
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,480
and the way that chemistry rolls forward

725
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,040
to produce emergent complexity.

726
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,120
But it's really critical to realize now

727
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,160
that since the 40s,

728
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,560
we've had in cybernetics and control theory,

729
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,840
we've had a mature science of machines with goals.

730
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,800
It is no longer magical thinking to say

731
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,120
that these kinds of processes have goals.

732
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,880
That better be true because we also consist

733
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,320
of these kinds of processes.

734
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,280
And if they cannot support goal-directed behavior,

735
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:41,480
then it's unclear what to say about our cognition either.

736
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,960
This kind of weird view of looking at it

737
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,080
to say that the development

738
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,920
is actually a goal-directed process

739
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,880
that moves towards a kind of target morphology

740
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,720
makes a couple of predictions.

741
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,440
It means that we should be able to find that mechanism.

742
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,960
It means that we should be able to decode it and rewrite it.

743
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,840
And if we rewrite it,

744
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,520
something amazing becomes possible.

745
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,000
It means that in order to make changes here,

746
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,840
let's say for regenerative medicine,

747
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,520
we don't need to change the genes.

748
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,640
And that's really good

749
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,240
because it is almost never clear

750
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,520
how you would change the genes,

751
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,600
even if CRISPR worked perfectly, which it will.

752
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,960
At some point, the question is,

753
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,160
which genes do you change

754
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,080
to make the edits that you want out here?

755
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,800
Instead of doing that,

756
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,480
we could change the pattern memory

757
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,080
and let the cells do what they do best,

758
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,600
which is build to it.

759
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,400
So we've now, for a couple of decades,

760
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,680
we've been pushing this idea

761
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,200
and exploring the predictions of this goal-directed behavior.

762
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,120
So the first question we needed to ask

763
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,160
is where could these pattern memories be stored?

764
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,400
And we already have one clear example

765
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,440
of collections of cells

766
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,600
that store complex patterns

767
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,760
as endpoints of goal-directed behavior,

768
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,960
and that would be the brain.

769
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,720
So in the brain, we know you have

770
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,160
electrical networks of cells

771
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,200
that produce action potentials

772
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,800
and voltage gradients

773
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,560
via ion channels across their surface.

774
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,480
We call that ZMEM, the resting potential.

775
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,560
And that supports an amazing kind of software.

776
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,360
Here you can see in vivo physiology

777
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,400
of a zebrafish brain,

778
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,480
where people in neuroscience

779
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,760
try to do neural decoding.

780
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,520
The commitment of neuroscience

781
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,440
is that if you could understand this physiology,

782
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,840
you'd be able to decode the goals,

783
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,640
memories, preferences, and so on of this kind of system.

784
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,040
All the cognitive kinds of content

785
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,240
you should be able to decode

786
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,760
from this electrical activity.

787
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,080
It turns out that nature really figured out

788
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,360
that the electrical networks

789
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,960
are really good for this kind of thing

790
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,840
very early on.

791
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,800
The electrical networks are not about neurons.

792
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,160
They were here from the time of bacterial biofilms.

793
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,720
And all cells in your body have ion channels

794
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,880
and make resting potential gradients.

795
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,360
Most of these cells are connected to each other

796
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,440
through electrical synapses known as gap junctions.

797
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,640
And could we run the same kind of research program?

798
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,080
Could we look at, for example,

799
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,920
in this case an early frog embryo

800
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,400
and read out the electrical information

801
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,120
and ask what could this cellular collective

802
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,920
be thinking about?

803
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,240
We know what this cellular collective thinks about.

804
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,600
It largely thinks about movement

805
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,120
through three-dimensional space.

806
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,680
But embryos move through anatomical morphous space.

807
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,480
So could we understand how the earlier version

808
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,880
of this electrical system was used

809
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,120
to compute and to move us through morphous space?

810
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,960
So in our group,

811
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,760
we developed several different kinds of tools

812
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,000
first to read these patterns.

813
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,040
And so here is a voltage-sensitive dye in time lapse

814
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,520
showing you all the electrical conversations

815
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,200
that these cells are having with each other

816
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,240
to sort out where the different organs of the frog embryo

817
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,040
are going to be.

818
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,040
We do a lot of computational modeling

819
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,960
to tie the molecular biology together

820
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,520
with the voltage gradients that we observe

821
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,920
and ask questions about a pattern completion.

822
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,200
So if a part is deleted,

823
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,680
how does the network remember the whole and so on?

824
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,960
I'm going to show you two example patterns of this.

825
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
So this is what we call the electric face.

826
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,480
And this is a pattern of voltage.

827
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,640
Again, the colors indicate resting potential.

828
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,960
That this is one frame of the process

829
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,600
by which this embryo puts his face together.

830
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,560
And you can already see where everything is going to be.

831
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,000
The right eye is going to be here.

832
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,280
The placodes are out here.

833
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,800
The mouth is going to be here.

834
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,280
This is a subtle bioelectric pre-pattern

835
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,920
that tells these cells where to turn on the genes

836
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,360
if they have frizzles, BMPs, and so on to pattern the face.

837
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,480
And it's absolutely required.

838
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,320
If you change this pattern, the face changes.

839
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,280
I'm going to show you that in a minute.

840
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,280
Now, that's a normal pattern.

841
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,680
There's also pathological patterns,

842
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,840
such as when you inject an oncogene,

843
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,720
you can actually detect the defection of these cells

844
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,960
from the large-scale bioelectrical network

845
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,920
and the impending metastasis and tumor genesis.

846
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,200
You can see that here.

847
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,720
So beyond reading and recording these kind of patterns,

848
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,480
the key is to do functional perturbations,

849
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,600
do interventions.

850
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,400
And so for that reason, we developed some tools

851
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,320
to now write the content into that electrical pattern.

852
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,360
So just to link all of this back to the key concept

853
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,880
from the beginning of the talk,

854
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,640
we are literally treating the collective of cells

855
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,760
during morphogenesis as a collective intelligence,

856
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,360
which exerts behavior in anatomical morphospace.

857
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,280
It moves the configuration of the body

858
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,320
from that of a single cell

859
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,600
to some whatever the complex animal it is or plant.

860
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,480
And the idea is that this is literally behavior

861
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,600
just in a different space.

862
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,000
And we now want to read and write

863
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,640
the primitive mind of that collective intelligence.

864
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,560
So how do we do this?

865
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,040
No magnets, electromagnetic fields,

866
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,960
electrodes, radiations, nothing like that.

867
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,600
We hijack the native bioelectrical interface

868
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,000
that these cells are using to hack each other.

869
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,840
So that is the ion channels

870
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,160
and the gap junctions that they express.

871
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,360
So we basically steal all the tools from neuroscience.

872
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,760
So this is ion channel drugs and optogenetics

873
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,080
and various manipulations of these channels

874
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,280
that you can use to control the voltage pattern

875
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,640
in this tissue.

876
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,560
When you do that, several things happen.

877
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,040
Initially, this work, for example,

878
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,280
this eye story was published in 2010.

879
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,280
Initially, when we said we wanted to change

880
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,480
the resting potential of cells,

881
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,200
the background assumption was going to be

882
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,680
that what you'll get is uninterpretable toxicity

883
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,680
and death because voltage was thought

884
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,120
to be a housekeeping parameter.

885
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,360
And I want to show you actually what it really does.

886
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,760
So what we do here is we inject some,

887
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,760
in this particular case, we inject some RNA

888
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,480
encoding a set of potassium channels.

889
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,320
What they can do with the cells they end up in,

890
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,400
once the proteins are made, is set a voltage,

891
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,920
a little pattern of voltage that looks like that eye spot

892
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,760
that I just showed you in the electric phase.

893
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,320
So when you do that, whichever cells get that pattern,

894
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,640
they are instructed by that pattern to build an eye.

895
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,440
And so here you have eye made from cells

896
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,040
that were supposed to be gut.

897
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
If you section those eyes, you get a lens,

898
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,880
retina, optic nerve, all the right stuff.

899
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,640
So here we learned some interesting things.

900
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,440
First of all, that the bioelectric pattern is instructive.

901
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,040
It actually calls up new eyes.

902
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,960
It's not just that we messed it up

903
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,200
and then the cells died and there's toxicity.

904
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,320
No, it's actually instructive.

905
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,400
You can call up healthy new organs

906
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,560
by specific bioelectric patterns.

907
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,600
It's modular.

908
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,080
We didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye.

909
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,760
In fact, we have no idea how to build an eye.

910
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,160
What we found is a high level subroutine,

911
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,200
a basically a high level trigger

912
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,120
that tells them to build an eye

913
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,480
and they take care of the rest.

914
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,040
It also, we also find that actually,

915
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,280
there's this prompt of this bioelectric pattern

916
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,120
reveals more competency in these cells

917
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,160
because in the developmental biology textbook,

918
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,360
it will tell you that only the anterior and erected room here

919
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,120
is competent to make eye.

920
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,520
And that's true if you prompt them with the Pac-6,

921
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,920
so-called master regulator eye gene.

922
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,320
But actually, these cells are perfectly competent.

923
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,240
It's just that nobody had prompted them

924
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,560
with a more convincing stimulus.

925
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,800
And so this again reminds us to be humble

926
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
in the sense that every assessment

927
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,720
of the competency of some system

928
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,040
is basically us taking an IQ test ourselves.

929
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,280
It's what are we able to discover about that system

930
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,040
and we need to be really cautious

931
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,400
in putting limits on things

932
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,840
when we haven't fully understood

933
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,360
what the system is capable of.

934
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,760
And finally, what I also really like about this

935
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,080
is this amazing property of self-scaling.

936
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,880
So this is a lens sitting out in the flank

937
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,160
of a tadpole somewhere.

938
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,240
The blue cells are the ones that we injected.

939
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,600
But look, the rest of the lens

940
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,480
is made of clear cells that we never touched directly.

941
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,160
So what's happening here is that these cells

942
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,080
got the message that they should build an eye,

943
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,280
but there's not enough of them.

944
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,800
And what they do is they recruit

945
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,640
a bunch of their completely normal neighbors,

946
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,760
so secondary instruction to help them in this task.

947
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,960
And of course, we already know

948
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,480
there are other collective intelligences

949
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,920
that do this, for example, ants.

950
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,280
So if a couple of ants find something

951
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,320
that's too heavy for them to lift,

952
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,280
what they'll do is recruit others to come and help.

953
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,120
So collective intelligences tend to have

954
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,760
this self-scaling property and the cells do it.

955
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,560
We've deployed this idea of high-level triggers

956
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,640
for very complex events for leg regeneration purposes.

957
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,160
So frogs, unlike salamanders, do not regenerate their legs.

958
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,040
And so if they lose a leg 45 days later, there's nothing.

959
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,280
We came up with a cocktail,

960
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,960
and this is Kelly Chang's work,

961
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,800
where what she did was treat them for 24 hours.

962
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,680
And it immediately induces a bunch of pro-regenerative genes.

963
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,760
And then by 45 days, you get some toes,

964
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,080
you get a toenail, eventually a pretty nice leg

965
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,720
that is touch-sensitive and motile.

966
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,320
Our latest paper shows one day of treatment

967
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,320
followed by a year and a half of leg growth

968
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,720
in the mature, fully adult frog.

969
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,640
That's, again, this notion of an early decision-making intervention.

970
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,720
We're not there to micromanage the stem cells

971
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,320
or tell any of the cells where they should go

972
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,920
or what the gene expression should be.

973
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,520
We have no idea how to do that.

974
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,280
And I don't think we will for a really long time,

975
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,840
but what we can do is discover the prompts,

976
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,120
the stimuli that get the system to undergo

977
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,920
certain complex behaviors, morphogenetic behaviors.

978
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,520
So here I should do a disclosure,

979
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,320
because David Kaplan and I have this spin-off company

980
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,760
called Morphosuticals.

981
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,440
And what we are doing now is trying this technology in mammals,

982
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,520
hopefully eventually towards human patients,

983
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,680
but we're nowhere near human patients yet.

984
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,720
The idea is to use a wearable bioreactor,

985
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,120
an aqueous environment in which we control the bioelectric

986
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,800
and other states of these cells

987
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,800
and get them to commit early on to a leg-growing behavior

988
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,800
versus a scarring behavior.

989
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,760
Okay, the next quick story I'm going to tell you is about planaria.

990
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,840
And so here are these flatworms.

991
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,760
And perhaps one of the most interesting things

992
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,080
about these flatworms is that they are immortal.

993
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,680
So these theories of aging that say that aging is inevitable,

994
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,880
that because it's a kind of accumulation of mistakes

995
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,120
and entropic loss and so on,

996
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,960
I think they cannot be corrected.

997
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,600
The asexual strains of these animals do not age.

998
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,160
Nobody's ever seen an old asexual planarian.

999
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,840
They just continuously regenerate their bodies.

1000
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,360
And you might ask a question,

1001
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,520
if you amputate the head and the tail

1002
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,880
and you have this middle fragment,

1003
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,240
how does that middle fragment know

1004
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,160
how many heads it's supposed to have?

1005
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,960
Like right here, this piece is going to grow ahead

1006
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,360
and then the same, the near neighbor cells here

1007
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,640
are actually going to grow a tail.

1008
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,840
Why do they do different things?

1009
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,080
How does this thing know how many heads

1010
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,600
each fragment is supposed to have?

1011
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,440
And so we found an electric circuit

1012
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,760
which maintains a pattern like this

1013
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,120
that says one head, one tail.

1014
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,760
And if you cut this reliably, you get one headed worms.

1015
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,080
And if we rewrite that electrical information

1016
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,240
using ion channel drug exposure,

1017
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,080
just for the first few hours,

1018
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,920
what it'll do is set a voltage pattern

1019
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,760
that's like this and it holds.

1020
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,400
And then if you later cut this animal,

1021
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,520
this perfectly normal anatomically correct looking animal

1022
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,680
with normal gene expression, normal anatomy,

1023
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,920
will then regenerate us two heads

1024
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,800
because that is what its pattern memory says.

1025
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,040
So I promised you early on in the talk

1026
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,280
that we are going to find and rewrite

1027
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,320
the literal pattern memories that the tissue has

1028
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,920
about what it's supposed to build,

1029
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,880
what it's supposed to look like.

1030
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,400
This is it, you're looking at it.

1031
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,040
These are much scans you might do of a brain.

1032
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,760
This is the collective intelligence of these cells,

1033
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,760
maintains a memory, we can read that memory.

1034
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,240
And this is what this animal now thinks

1035
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,080
a proper plenarian should look like.

1036
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,800
It doesn't come into effect until it's injured

1037
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,200
and the cells are called upon to read that memory

1038
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,480
until then it's latent.

1039
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,960
So this is actually a counterfactual memory.

1040
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,480
The collective intelligence of cells

1041
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,320
is able to hold counterfactual memories.

1042
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,320
That's a pretty advanced style capacity actually.

1043
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,640
Why do I keep calling it a memory?

1044
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,680
Because if we take this two-headed animal

1045
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,120
and we cut off the primary head,

1046
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,200
we cut off this ectopic secondary head,

1047
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,880
you might think that it should go back to normal.

1048
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,600
After all, the genomic information is the same.

1049
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,920
We didn't touch the genome, there's no editing here.

1050
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,200
No trans genes.

1051
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,800
You might think that it should go back to normal,

1052
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,760
but in fact, it doesn't.

1053
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,440
These animals continue to generate

1054
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,520
two-headed animals in perpetuity.

1055
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,360
The first two-headed worms

1056
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,680
caused by it induced by a different mechanism

1057
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,320
were seen around 1903 by Thomas Hunt Morgan.

1058
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,600
Between that time and 2009,

1059
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600
nobody had recut them to our knowledge

1060
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,120
because it seemed completely obvious

1061
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,760
of what would happen.

1062
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,120
The genetics are unchanged, of course,

1063
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,000
it'll go back to normal.

1064
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,120
Why would you recut them?

1065
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,280
And only this, and so the reason I mentioned this

1066
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,600
is because the conceptual part matters.

1067
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,560
It defines what experiments you are going to do,

1068
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,600
the way you think about this,

1069
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,320
and whether you think of genetics as specifying

1070
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,080
in a hardwired way what the outcome is

1071
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,800
versus as a kind of reprogrammable medium

1072
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,520
where you might say,

1073
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,280
I wonder if the memory has been reprogrammed

1074
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,560
and in fact, that's what happens here.

1075
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,880
So this has all the properties of memory,

1076
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,200
it's long-term stable, it's rewritable,

1077
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,360
it has conditional recall, which I just showed you,

1078
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,800
and here are these two-headed animals hanging out.

1079
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,440
Not only can you make animals with the wrong number of heads,

1080
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,520
but you can make this way animals with heads

1081
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,800
from other species.

1082
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,320
So this is a triangular-headed dugezia doradoscephala,

1083
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,120
you cut off the head, perturb the bioelectric circuit,

1084
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,920
and you can end up with flat heads like a Pifolina,

1085
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,480
you can end up with round heads like an S-Mediterrania,

1086
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,760
or of course, the normal heads.

1087
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,200
Not just the head shape,

1088
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,880
but the distribution of stem cells,

1089
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,720
the shape of the brain, and so these other species

1090
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,440
sit in these attractors in the state space,

1091
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,760
in the anatomical space, state space naturally,

1092
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,600
but you can convince this hardware to visit those regions.

1093
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,200
Without any genetic reprogramming,

1094
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,520
the exact same normal hardware can actually visit

1095
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,320
those other regions of anatomical state space.

1096
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,320
Now, you can go well beyond that,

1097
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,120
and we've made these kind of crazy, spiky shape things,

1098
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,920
these cylinders, this is not even a flat like a planarian,

1099
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:03,160
it's supposed to be combination forms.

1100
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,840
And so now we have to start thinking about

1101
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,400
what is the space of possibilities for these?

1102
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,440
In developmental biology,

1103
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,760
we hear a lot about developmental constraints,

1104
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,320
as if there were things that cells cannot build.

1105
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,360
We actually have no idea what cells can and cannot build.

1106
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,240
So let's just take a look at this simple fact

1107
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,560
that we are not the only bioengineers.

1108
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,720
So here's a cool plant example,

1109
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,480
I'm obsessed with these gauze lately,

1110
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,760
but this is what the acorn normally builds.

1111
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,200
Okay, so this is the oak leaf,

1112
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
and if all you look at is this,

1113
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:35,000
you will get the idea that this is incredibly reliable,

1114
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,360
and that what the oak genome does is specify this,

1115
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,640
this is what it can do.

1116
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,080
But along comes a parasite,

1117
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,320
this is a wasp of a particular type,

1118
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,560
and the wasp is an interesting bioengineer.

1119
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,560
What it has, the lineage of the wasp,

1120
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,520
not the individual wasps,

1121
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,760
but the evolutionary lineage has learned

1122
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,480
is how to prompt these cells,

1123
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,960
perfectly normal, not genetically edited cells,

1124
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,800
to build something completely different.

1125
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,360
This big round, bitey, red, and yellow thing

1126
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,800
is made of these cells,

1127
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,840
okay, because they were prompted by this bioengineer.

1128
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,520
Would we have any clue that these cells

1129
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,200
are capable of building something like this?

1130
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,960
We'd have no idea if we didn't already see

1131
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,160
that this was here.

1132
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,680
So we have to understand now

1133
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,920
that the reliability of hereditary is really deceiving,

1134
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,560
because it keeps us from realizing

1135
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,240
what the space of possibilities are,

1136
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,440
and that bioprompting in this way

1137
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,120
is actually really powerful,

1138
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,640
and can let you do things

1139
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,160
that micromanagement cannot let you do.

1140
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,360
So when our group were trying

1141
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,120
for this kind of full stack approach,

1142
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,880
where you start with a molecular biology

1143
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,360
that tells you which ion channels are present,

1144
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,520
and then bioelectric simulators

1145
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,760
to understand tissue level bioelectric patterns

1146
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,880
and where they come from,

1147
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,200
and then dynamic properties of these patterns,

1148
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,120
if we cut the animal, do they rescale,

1149
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,040
do they restore, do they have memory,

1150
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,560
do they have plasticity,

1151
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,920
and from there to basically algorithmic models

1152
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,480
of how large scale anatomical decisions

1153
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,000
are going to be made.

1154
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,160
And once you have some of those models in hand,

1155
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,560
you can do rational interventions.

1156
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,560
So this is a normal frog brain,

1157
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:05,480
forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain,

1158
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,560
and under a variety of teratogens,

1159
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,400
this can be messed up.

1160
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,520
So for example, from nicotine,

1161
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,880
you can see the difference here

1162
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,240
between this brain and this.

1163
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,440
And so we asked, okay,

1164
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:17,240
is there any hope that using this bioelectrical information,

1165
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,520
we can actually restore something as complex as this?

1166
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,800
You might think that what you'd have to do

1167
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,400
is tattoo every single cell

1168
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,680
with the appropriate information

1169
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,240
to get back into this very specific pattern.

1170
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,320
So we made a computational model.

1171
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,320
This is Alexis Pytaka and Baipav Pai in my group did this,

1172
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,160
and they made this model and they asked,

1173
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,160
okay, under a scenario like this,

1174
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,360
when things have gone wrong,

1175
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,280
what can we do to the bioelectrical gradient

1176
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,480
to get back to normal?

1177
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,240
And the model actually suggested

1178
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,680
one particular ion channel,

1179
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,360
which is called the HCN2,

1180
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,280
and that channel has some really interesting properties

1181
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:49,640
that I don't have time to get into here,

1182
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,400
but one of the things it does

1183
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,920
is restore sharp bioelectrical patterns,

1184
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,200
it restore borders between adjacent compartments.

1185
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,600
And what that does is able to repair even genetic defects.

1186
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,200
So here's a normal brain.

1187
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,480
Here's the brain of a tadpole

1188
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,400
with a dominant notch mutant.

1189
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,920
So you can see the forebrain is gone,

1190
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,000
the midbrain and hindbrain are a big bubble.

1191
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,440
And even on that background,

1192
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,280
if you also give it either HCN2 RNA

1193
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,520
or a couple of human-approved drugs

1194
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,520
that are HCN2 openers,

1195
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,080
these animals will end up with a normal brain structure,

1196
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,880
normal brain gene expression, and normal IQs.

1197
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,160
If you test them on learning rates,

1198
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,000
they're indistinguishable from controls.

1199
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,960
So I'm not arguing that we can always fix genetic errors,

1200
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,120
but in some cases, you can fix hardware defects in software.

1201
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,800
So an exposure of this animal

1202
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,440
with a really powerful notch mutation

1203
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,320
to a drug that was picked by a computational platform

1204
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,720
restores a complex organ.

1205
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,240
So the future, as we see, is a workflow like this

1206
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,440
where there's a bunch of information of health and disease.

1207
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,000
And these data, by the way, are not available.

1208
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,760
We're just gearing up now to let this kind of physiology

1209
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:01,240
catch up to the omics kind of a data sets

1210
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,240
that exist for protein and RNA.

1211
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,480
And then we can ask which kinds of ion flow states

1212
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,000
would restore the correct pattern.

1213
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,080
And then it becomes fairly straightforward

1214
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,440
to find drugs that will do that.

1215
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,480
And so you can play with this.

1216
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,960
The early version of that platform is here.

1217
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,120
Okay, so I'm just going to wrap up

1218
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,280
by saying a couple of big picture things.

1219
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,640
We know that both evolution and development

1220
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,280
have scaled what they've fundamentally done

1221
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,360
is scaled the size of goals.

1222
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,880
So these little tiny creatures, microbes, and single cells

1223
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,320
have little tiny goals.

1224
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,360
They're cognitive light cones or the size of the goals

1225
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,760
that they're able to produce and work towards

1226
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,760
are basically right around the size of themselves.

1227
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,280
They don't care what happens in the environment.

1228
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,880
They just care about the internal physiological states.

1229
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,360
But here, in this kind of system,

1230
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,560
their tiny little goals have been inflated

1231
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,960
towards a very grandiose construction project,

1232
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,080
making a whole limb.

1233
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,640
We know it's a goal because if you deviate them from that goal,

1234
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:58,920
they will work very hard.

1235
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:01,080
They will spend all kinds of energy to rebuild.

1236
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,080
And when they reach that goal, they stop.

1237
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,960
And so now, whereas here, there are tiny little goals

1238
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,280
and physiological and transcriptional state space,

1239
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,480
here you have much larger goals and anatomical state space.

1240
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,920
But that amazing set of mechanisms,

1241
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,720
which we can talk about if people have questions,

1242
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,840
the set of mechanisms that allow the scaling of goals

1243
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,520
has a failure mode.

1244
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,800
That failure mode is cancer.

1245
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,400
So this is glioblastoma.

1246
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:28,280
Individual cells can disconnect from the electrical network.

1247
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,160
And at that point, they roll back to be amoebas.

1248
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:32,760
They are not more selfish.

1249
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,480
It's just that their cells are smaller, quite literally.

1250
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,240
The self here is very large.

1251
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,000
This is the kind of goals that it can pursue.

1252
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,120
These are tiny little cells here looking out for themselves.

1253
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,320
So we have developed ways to not only detect this process early,

1254
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,280
so this is hopefully a diagnostic modality for the future,

1255
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,040
but also to suppress it.

1256
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,640
Because instead of killing these cells,

1257
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,800
so this is the same animal here.

1258
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:59,240
This tapo is injected with a nasty human oncogene,

1259
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,000
for example, a P53 mutation or a KRAS or something.

1260
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,640
And the oncoprotein is very strongly expressed.

1261
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,840
In fact, it's all over the place here.

1262
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,960
It's labeled it.

1263
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,240
But there is no tumor.

1264
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,560
And that's because we co-injected an ion channel

1265
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,600
that forces these cells to stay in electrical communication

1266
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,400
with their neighbors.

1267
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,120
That's it.

1268
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,200
We don't regulate any of the other processes.

1269
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,760
We just reconnect it to the large-scale network

1270
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,240
that remembers that you should be working on the skin

1271
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,360
and muscle and things like that and not making a tumor.

1272
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:30,200
That means that we can think about next-generation biomedicine

1273
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:34,360
from the perspective of the protocognitive capacity

1274
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,920
of the material that we are trying to repair.

1275
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,680
So not just micromanagement,

1276
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,880
but actually all the way through the scales of the system,

1277
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,600
perhaps guided by our computational platforms

1278
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,080
and various AI wrappers on top of that,

1279
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,920
we can ask, what is the most efficient interaction interface?

1280
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,720
And I think biology and evolution work so well

1281
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,960
precisely because they don't micromanage.

1282
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,400
Evolution makes problem-solving machines at multiple scales

1283
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,560
and it is hacking at every level.

1284
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,160
Every cell is trying to hack every other cell and tissues.

1285
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,800
And they're all trying to hack themselves, by the way,

1286
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,360
to get them to do adaptive things

1287
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,680
despite the various problems in the environment.

1288
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,840
And so that means that we can take advantage of this.

1289
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,320
All of this stuff, the ability to sense,

1290
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,880
to amplify signals, to generalize, to discriminate,

1291
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,280
learn, and ultimately solve problems.

1292
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,680
Instead of building them from scratch ourselves,

1293
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,440
as we now do with robotics,

1294
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,160
we can take advantage of a billion years

1295
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,600
of optimizing these kind of capacities.

1296
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,000
And so we can think, now let's think about something else.

1297
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,600
Not only is our target,

1298
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,360
so the patient or the bioengineer tissue,

1299
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:43,000
not only is our target somewhat up here in the spectrum,

1300
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,240
but actually our intervention could be too.

1301
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,280
Right now we use drugs.

1302
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,240
Drugs, for the most part, are extremely dumb.

1303
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,600
They are very simple machines.

1304
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,960
They only do the one thing they do.

1305
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:54,120
They bind whatever targets they're going to bind,

1306
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,160
and that's it.

1307
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,600
And that's very limiting.

1308
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,120
Some kind of smart intervention.

1309
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,520
And yes, it could be an implanted piece of engineering,

1310
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:02,440
like a smart insulin pump or something like that.

1311
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,760
But here's a different way to think about it.

1312
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,920
So let's take a look at this thing.

1313
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,280
So here it is running around.

1314
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,440
If I were to ask you what that was,

1315
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,120
you might say that this is,

1316
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:13,880
we got this from a pond somewhere,

1317
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,360
a primitive organism from the bottom of a lake.

1318
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,200
And if you were to sequence the genome,

1319
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,480
you would find out something pretty well.

1320
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,720
The genome is 100% homo sapiens.

1321
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,520
Okay, what you're looking at here

1322
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,440
is something we call an anthrobot.

1323
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:29,480
It's a new, it's the next version of arzenobots,

1324
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,080
which are biological, self-multile biological constructs

1325
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:33,800
made from frog cells.

1326
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,640
These are made from human patient cells.

1327
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,720
There is no genetic modification here.

1328
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,240
There are no weird nanomaterials.

1329
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,960
There is no trans genes, no circuits.

1330
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,600
So far, we can add all those things and we will as needed.

1331
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,880
But for now, we're really interested in the baseline

1332
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,320
competencies, the plasticity.

1333
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,520
And so there's a protocol

1334
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,240
that causes these little guys to develop up here.

1335
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,400
They start to, they're basically lung organoids,

1336
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,640
and then they, we get them to turn inside out.

1337
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,720
And then you see what they really do

1338
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,960
when your lung epithelium gets to reboot

1339
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,280
its multicellularity and have a new life.

1340
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:06,600
And so they become these highly multi-little creatures

1341
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,360
that have all kinds of capacities.

1342
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,280
Here's one navigating a scratch

1343
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,880
through a bunch of neural tissue.

1344
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,240
So all this gray stuff out here

1345
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,920
is IPSC-derived human neural tissue.

1346
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,160
It's a lawn and we made this scratch through it

1347
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,520
and you could see it moving.

1348
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,360
Now, it's moving through this.

1349
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,560
What might be the interactions

1350
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,960
between the amphibot and this tissue here?

1351
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,480
If you let a bunch of them settle down,

1352
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,480
we call this a super bot or a bridge bot,

1353
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,640
because there's a bunch of them together.

1354
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,680
If you let them settle down,

1355
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,680
what you find is that over about four days,

1356
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,520
what they do is they knit the two sides

1357
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,200
of the wound together.

1358
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,480
And this is what it looks like.

1359
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,920
Now, whoever would have thought

1360
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,160
that your tracheal cell sitting quietly

1361
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,840
in your lungs and in your trachea for decades,

1362
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,400
that given a new environment,

1363
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,840
they would be able to reboot their multi-cellularity

1364
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,160
in a way that not only lets them move around

1365
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:56,280
and do other interesting things,

1366
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,160
but actually exert healing capacity on your other cells.

1367
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,920
Your tracheal cells have the capacity

1368
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,840
to fix peripheral innervation.

1369
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,040
What else do they know how to do?

1370
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:04,840
We have no idea.

1371
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,360
This was the first thing we tried.

1372
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,040
This was not test number 78

1373
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,720
out of a thousand different things we tried.

1374
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:10,680
This was the first thing.

1375
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:11,560
So I'm going to assume

1376
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,080
that we're not just extremely lucky

1377
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:14,600
to find the one thing that they know how to do.

1378
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,600
There's actually a ton of capabilities here.

1379
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,800
And the other interesting thing

1380
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,800
is that as a kind of intervention,

1381
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,120
something that might someday be personalized,

1382
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,880
medicine bots made from your own cells

1383
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,840
to go into your own body,

1384
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,440
no immune suppression needed,

1385
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,240
to do repairs, to clean out your arteries,

1386
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,400
drop off the pro-regenerative molecules

1387
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,520
as a million applications.

1388
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,240
But the cool thing is that unlike,

1389
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,240
let's say, nanorobotics or something else

1390
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,760
where we build it directly,

1391
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,920
these guys are your own cells.

1392
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,000
They share all the priors with your body

1393
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,280
about what health and diseases,

1394
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:46,120
what inflammation is, what cancer is,

1395
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:46,920
and so on.

1396
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:47,720
And these are not things

1397
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,200
we have to build into them from scratch.

1398
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,640
So the last thing I want to say

1399
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,080
is that moving forward,

1400
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,160
the field of biomedical interventions,

1401
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,160
this is what's currently on the table.

1402
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,920
So these kind of bottom-up interventions

1403
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,840
of surgery and stem cells and all this stuff.

1404
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,880
But there's this whole other gigantic set

1405
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,400
of approaches coming,

1406
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,520
which are top-down,

1407
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,840
which has to do with not only behavior shaping.

1408
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,960
We haven't even talked about this,

1409
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,840
but we have some really interesting approaches

1410
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,520
to training cells and tissues.

1411
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,440
And these are agential implants,

1412
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,240
and then various kinds of morphosuticals

1413
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,880
that speak to the anatomical intelligence.

1414
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,480
And so these are just some examples

1415
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,760
of what's actually coming.

1416
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,480
So my guess is,

1417
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,840
oh, and you can see the details

1418
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,960
in these reviews.

1419
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,520
So my guess is that future medicine

1420
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,080
is going to look a lot more like psychiatry

1421
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,600
than it's going to look like chemistry.

1422
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,840
We are really talking about exploiting

1423
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,680
the tools and the insights of neuroscience,

1424
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,600
very deep insights of neuroscience

1425
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,400
beyond neurons

1426
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,040
to understand multi-scale intelligent systems.

1427
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,120
And I think the ability to hack this

1428
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,240
for transformative health applications is massive.

1429
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,840
I will just thank all of the people

1430
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,640
that are doing the work

1431
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:54,920
that I mentioned here today,

1432
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,000
the various postdocs and students.

1433
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,960
All the technical support

1434
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,640
are many amazing collaborators,

1435
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,880
our funders who support this stuff.

1436
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,640
Again, disclosures.

1437
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,560
There's three companies that fund

1438
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,840
some of this work here.

1439
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,200
And Jeremy Gay,

1440
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,640
who did a lot of the illustrations

1441
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,600
that I just showed you,

1442
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,840
and most of all, the animal model systems,

1443
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,320
because they really have the hardest job of all here.

1444
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,480
So I will stop here and answer questions.

1445
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,040
Thank you so much.

1446
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,920
That was another mindblower.

1447
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,040
Thank you so much.

1448
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,400
I know we're over time now,

1449
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,160
but it would be difficult

1450
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,920
to synthesize all of the questions from the chat.

1451
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,040
Honestly, I have no,

1452
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,640
I'm not even going to try to do this.

1453
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,160
But I think for this group in particular,

1454
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,840
perhaps what's most interesting

1455
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,040
is if you were thinking about

1456
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:35,800
what people in this group could do

1457
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,560
to either improve work

1458
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,880
on the more elliptaceutical notion

1459
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,600
of what you mentioned,

1460
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,760
or on the agenda implant notion

1461
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,480
of what you mentioned,

1462
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,680
like where do you think

1463
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:45,800
are currently open challenges

1464
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,160
where people like maybe come from

1465
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,560
more of a biology aging background

1466
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,600
can like most help,

1467
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,440
or like how could they most help draw

1468
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,400
these applications into the field?

1469
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,680
What's outstanding there?

1470
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,400
What's left to do?

1471
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,760
Yeah, what's left to do?

1472
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,640
There's a lot left to do,

1473
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,920
but let's just talk about

1474
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,360
the aging thing in particular.

1475
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,800
So the theory of aging

1476
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,960
that we have been playing with

1477
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,240
is this idea that

1478
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,120
if you think about anatomical homeostasis,

1479
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,560
the need to continuously work

1480
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,680
towards maintaining a shape,

1481
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,360
that doesn't stop in adulthood.

1482
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,560
Once you've built the body,

1483
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:19,880
cells are dying and being reborn all the time,

1484
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:20,520
it has to,

1485
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,480
you have to work pretty hard

1486
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,920
to stay in the same in one place.

1487
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,760
So that morphostasis

1488
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,280
is happening all the time.

1489
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,600
But that requires having information

1490
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,440
about what the body is supposed to look like.

1491
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,800
If you're going to resist the drift

1492
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,760
of noise and aging

1493
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,880
and then cancer and so on,

1494
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,840
it requires you to have

1495
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,000
a crisp memory of the target morphology.

1496
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,760
And could it be that during aging

1497
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,120
that what happens is that

1498
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,240
there's a degradation

1499
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,720
of the target of morphology pattern memory?

1500
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,400
Maybe the pattern memory gets fuzzy.

1501
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,000
And we know when in development,

1502
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,960
if we make it fuzzy,

1503
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,680
development goes to,

1504
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,040
how can you get birth defects

1505
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,640
in adulthood if it gets fuzzy?

1506
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,040
I think what that looks like is aging.

1507
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,400
And so our approach currently

1508
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,680
is to think about ways

1509
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,880
to basically to sharpen that pattern

1510
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,720
and to refine that information.

1511
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,360
And so this means really developing

1512
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,440
not only the conceptual tools around

1513
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,840
aging as a defect of geometry,

1514
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,280
not a fundamental bio count.

1515
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,880
And of course, it might be multiple things.

1516
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,800
I'm not saying this is the only useful model,

1517
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,000
but to really develop

1518
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,840
the conceptual apparatus around this

1519
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,320
and then to build new tools.

1520
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,120
So we need more,

1521
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,800
but we need better ways

1522
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,720
to do voltage imaging in vivo.

1523
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:25,560
So there's a lot of technology development there.

1524
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,720
We need all kinds of efforts

1525
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,440
for better ion channel drugs,

1526
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:32,120
better computational models.

1527
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,760
Physiomics is huge as a huge need.

1528
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,960
We simply do not know

1529
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,000
what all the correct voltage states are

1530
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,600
for health and disease in different organs

1531
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,560
at different ages.

1532
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,000
So acquiring that data set

1533
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,840
is something that we are going to do.

1534
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,120
It's very important.

1535
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:46,920
It hasn't been done

1536
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,480
because molecular biology and biochemistry,

1537
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,920
they can work with dead tissue.

1538
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,040
So you fractionate your cells,

1539
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:53,640
you get your protein, your RNA, whatever,

1540
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:54,440
and that's fine.

1541
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,800
You can make a list of what you have.

1542
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,320
Bioelectricity doesn't work that way.

1543
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,880
As soon as the cell is dead,

1544
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,600
this is gone.

1545
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,440
You cannot do this in non-living tissue.

1546
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,600
So all of this has to be in vivo

1547
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,960
and it's quite difficult.

1548
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,120
So those are just some of the challenges

1549
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:10,040
that we're facing now.

1550
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:10,440
All right.

1551
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:10,760
Thanks.

1552
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,160
I don't know.

1553
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:11,960
Do you have to hop off?

1554
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,520
I have till 2.15.

1555
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,880
So I have another 10 minutes.

1556
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:16,360
Okay.

1557
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:16,680
Okay.

1558
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,960
Then let me get with,

1559
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,600
I think Micah,

1560
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,120
your question was highly uploaded.

1561
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:22,200
If you want to unmute your thoughts

1562
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,640
on the long term,

1563
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,080
I can also otherwise ask it.

1564
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:25,960
Sure.

1565
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,920
So I think you answered it,

1566
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,040
but I was wondering if you can go

1567
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,320
into a little more detail on

1568
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,480
how do we get to a place

1569
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,480
where we can image a living human

1570
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,560
and read its bioelectrical state?

1571
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,520
Like right now people are doing this

1572
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,960
with brains and then they plug

1573
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:41,320
the output into an AI

1574
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,080
and the AI is now learning

1575
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,920
how to interpret what that means.

1576
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,360
Presumably we want to do the same thing

1577
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:48,600
with the bioelectric network of the whole body.

1578
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,360
What is the path to get there

1579
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,960
technologically or like

1580
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,080
what research needs to be done?

1581
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,000
Very similar to the question Ellison asked.

1582
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:55,960
Yeah.

1583
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,640
The straightforward path

1584
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,720
is going to be to develop.

1585
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,640
So right now we have voltage sensitive dyes

1586
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,560
that can give us the bioelectric state of cells

1587
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,200
you can see,

1588
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,120
but obviously the majority of the body

1589
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,480
ourselves you cannot see.

1590
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:11,800
So some kind of improved bioelectric re-imaging technology

1591
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,920
that can let us read the state of deep tissues

1592
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,800
and then of course the computational models

1593
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,720
to go from the understanding

1594
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,240
of the patterns of health and disease

1595
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,680
to how to turn the disease ones

1596
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,560
into the healthy ones.

1597
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,160
That's the straightforward way.

1598
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,960
I happen to think there's a shortcut

1599
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,320
and I think the shortcut

1600
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,320
is going to be around understanding

1601
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,800
the higher level information processing

1602
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,400
in these networks.

1603
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,240
In other words, I really don't think in the end

1604
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,520
we're going to be micromanaging

1605
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,560
the bioelectric state

1606
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,080
any more than I want to micromanage

1607
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,360
of the molecular state.

1608
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,840
I think it's going to be the equivalent

1609
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,400
of what we do in behavior science.

1610
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,680
If you have a rat

1611
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,680
and you want them to do a little circus trick,

1612
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,360
one way is to try to play the body

1613
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,120
like a puppet and control every neuron

1614
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,000
and try to get them to walk

1615
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,040
and do the various things,

1616
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,200
but the much easier way is to train the rat

1617
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,520
because the rat offers this amazing interface

1618
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,160
called learning,

1619
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:03,000
which enables you to give rewards and punishments

1620
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,120
and you don't have to know the details

1621
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,560
of which neurons are doing what.

1622
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,800
I think it's going to end up like this.

1623
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,000
I think we're going to,

1624
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
once we figure out what actual

1625
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,520
protocognitive capacities

1626
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:13,960
these electrical networks have,

1627
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,160
we're going to develop a kind of

1628
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,640
systematic training protocols

1629
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:19,240
where you can give them stimuli

1630
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,680
and it's not going to be about

1631
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,200
knowing which cells have which voltage

1632
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,120
is going to be a much higher level intervention,

1633
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,800
but stay tuned about that.

1634
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,160
We're still working that out.

1635
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,080
We have Ben Moskowitz next.

1636
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,120
Hey, sorry.

1637
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,120
Sorry about that.

1638
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,720
I was wondering if,

1639
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,840
I guess like what we're just saying

1640
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,680
about like the brain dynamics of

1641
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,480
being able to read the state

1642
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,200
and then be more predictive from experimentation,

1643
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,920
like for the plan area

1644
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,440
to be able to modify their head generation

1645
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,560
to be able to say two heads,

1646
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,600
four heads, something like this

1647
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,400
and the construction,

1648
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,280
you need to be able to manipulate

1649
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,400
the electrical networks

1650
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,160
to guide the cells

1651
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,680
like towards that goal that you want.

1652
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,640
So do you have a systematic way

1653
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,640
to approach that problem currently?

1654
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,760
Or is it mostly through experimentation

1655
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,320
and like once we collect the larger data set,

1656
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,440
it'll be able to be much more

1657
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,680
like AI driven or something like that?

1658
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,840
Yeah, up until now,

1659
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,760
the only path that we've had

1660
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,320
is to observe natural patterns

1661
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,440
and try to infer.

1662
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:21,400
So if you want to know

1663
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,000
what bioelectric pattern kicks off,

1664
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,880
eye development,

1665
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,120
when you look early on in the embryo

1666
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,320
before the eye comes up and that,

1667
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,440
oh, wow, there's an eye spot

1668
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,960
and that's the pattern that kicks it off.

1669
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,080
You can do the same for limb.

1670
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,440
You can do the same for the brain.

1671
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,720
So we've now done it in,

1672
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,040
I don't know,

1673
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,800
half a dozen different contexts.

1674
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,720
It's extremely difficult

1675
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,080
and time consuming.

1676
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,760
And I am hoping

1677
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,840
and we're working on some of this

1678
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,960
to develop automated robot scientist platforms

1679
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,360
that together with improved bioelectric

1680
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,320
characterization machinery,

1681
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,120
better dyes,

1682
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,720
maybe CAT scan reagents

1683
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,560
and so on that are voltage sensitive.

1684
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,000
We can automate that process,

1685
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,040
make it high throughput

1686
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,640
and really then from there,

1687
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,760
use AI and maybe conventional analysis tools

1688
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,280
to extract an understanding

1689
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:05,240
of the bioelectric code.

1690
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,480
That's what we call is cracking the bioelectric code.

1691
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,200
For now,

1692
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:10,440
our number of examples is quite low

1693
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,600
and so all we can do is look at

1694
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,400
normal embryos,

1695
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,360
normal regeneration,

1696
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,280
normal tumor genesis

1697
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,720
and try to learn from that.

1698
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:18,680
But I think ultimately

1699
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,280
we would like to scan the whole

1700
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,000
many species,

1701
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:21,960
many different ages,

1702
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,400
many different disease conditions

1703
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,120
and from that,

1704
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,880
figure out what actually the encoding

1705
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,240
is top to bottom.

1706
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:27,960
That's ambitious.

1707
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,080
Okay, Shruti, you next.

1708
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,800
Hi, it was an amazing talk.

1709
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,240
Thank you so much, Michael.

1710
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,160
I was wondering what else are we missing?

1711
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:37,320
Bioelectricity is of course one aspect,

1712
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,360
but also there must be other forces,

1713
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:40,680
right,

1714
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,920
electromagnetic dissonant light waves,

1715
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,680
sound waves,

1716
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,360
some weak UQ forces.

1717
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,800
I'm not able to sync all of them,

1718
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:50,280
but like all of these exist in nature

1719
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,760
and I'm sure they must exist in the body as well.

1720
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:56,440
Are there any labs that are working on this

1721
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,720
or tools that are

1722
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,760
resistant to even stark testing these things?

1723
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,000
Yeah, yeah, that's a great question.

1724
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,320
And we think about this stuff all the time

1725
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:07,640
and I encourage my students

1726
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:09,080
and postdocs to ask,

1727
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,280
what would we be missing?

1728
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,240
Using the approaches

1729
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:11,960
and more importantly,

1730
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,960
the conceptual tools that we have,

1731
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:15,800
what would they absolutely not see?

1732
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,320
And so you got your known unknowns

1733
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,280
and your unknown unknowns.

1734
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,040
So I can't say anything about the unknown unknowns,

1735
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,080
but for the known unknowns,

1736
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:21,960
there's a few things.

1737
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,520
So we know that we really don't understand yet

1738
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:27,080
the phenomenon of mitogenic radiation,

1739
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,680
so ultra weak photon emission.

1740
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,680
So there are some good labs that work on this.

1741
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,920
Cells are exchanging light

1742
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,080
and other kinds of electromagnetic radiation

1743
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:35,560
with each other.

1744
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,320
We don't know what it does.

1745
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:38,680
We don't have good tools for it,

1746
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,440
but I'm going to guess

1747
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,040
that it's probably quite important.

1748
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,640
There may be sound,

1749
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,040
vibratory kind of things that happen.

1750
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,760
The nuclear envelope has an electrical potential across it.

1751
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,520
We haven't even begun to scratch

1752
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,280
what implications that might have

1753
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,560
for gene expression.

1754
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,480
In fact, all the organelles have,

1755
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,720
all the membrane bound organelles have voltages.

1756
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,880
So yeah, biophysics is,

1757
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,880
I'm sure has tons of surprises for us.

1758
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,720
In fact, we can go in the opposite direction

1759
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,800
instead of looking down into these organelles,

1760
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,760
like we found recently

1761
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,680
that actually embryos talk to each other.

1762
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:09,480
So whole embryo,

1763
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,240
so groups of embryos make a,

1764
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,760
what I call a hyper embryo,

1765
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,160
where the whole large collections of embryos

1766
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,800
can solve problems that individual embryos cannot.

1767
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,440
And they have their own gene expression profiles

1768
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,840
that small groups of embryos don't have and so on.

1769
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,160
So there are many surprises here.

1770
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,680
And yeah, some of these are being studied

1771
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:27,800
and some we don't need to know about.

1772
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,520
Okay, maybe we have time for one more for you.

1773
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,040
Now, you had the idea in that phone on time,

1774
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:32,920
if you want to go for it.

1775
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,080
Sure, yes.

1776
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,120
Thank you, Tricia.

1777
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,240
Talk as usual, Mike.

1778
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:38,040
Thank you.

1779
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,760
Just, I'm trying to get my head around this.

1780
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,000
When you reconstitute an eye,

1781
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,360
let's say in the plant area,

1782
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:49,080
you're setting up some bioelectric pattern

1783
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,360
and you said you're changing

1784
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:54,920
the ion channel states of a few cells

1785
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,840
and then they communicate to the other

1786
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,200
surrounding cells, right?

1787
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,000
Something like that.

1788
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,160
I'm probably watching this up.

1789
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,120
So I'm just curious,

1790
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,200
when you do that,

1791
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,160
do you have to target specific cells

1792
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:11,000
and how many cells do you actually manipulate

1793
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,440
and then how many other cells

1794
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,600
do they have to interact with?

1795
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,880
Yeah, it's a great question.

1796
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:17,160
It depends on the scenario.

1797
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,040
So for example,

1798
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,480
we have one scenario where

1799
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,040
we can induce melanoma in these tadpoles

1800
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:23,480
without any kind of genetic damage,

1801
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:24,120
no oncogenes,

1802
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,520
just by disrupting the electrical communication.

1803
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,120
That takes about three cells.

1804
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,120
That only takes about three cells to do that.

1805
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:31,000
In the case of the eye,

1806
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,200
it's actually quite interesting

1807
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,360
because when you establish these cells

1808
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:35,240
that want to be eye,

1809
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,560
all of their neighbors are telling them,

1810
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,240
you're wrong, you should be skinned.

1811
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,080
And they have this debate back and forth

1812
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:41,720
and we can see it.

1813
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,760
We can literally see it

1814
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:43,960
because if you,

1815
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:45,880
I had this experience right from the beginning,

1816
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:46,680
I tried to,

1817
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,000
I wanted to make the whole embryo one giant eye.

1818
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,200
Okay, so I just wanted to turn every cell into an eye.

1819
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:56,040
So I shot it up with a ton of this potassium channel RNA

1820
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,320
and you look at the embryos

1821
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,240
and I was using a transgenic

1822
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,760
that is actually glows

1823
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,680
where the master eye gene is turned on.

1824
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:03,560
So I look at this thing

1825
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,240
and I see seven spots as I cool.

1826
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,840
This tadpole is going to have seven eyes.

1827
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,120
And then you look the next day

1828
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,400
and it's, oh wait, it's only four.

1829
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,760
And the next day, wait, it's only two.

1830
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,440
And the next day, you're lucky if you get one.

1831
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:13,720
So what's happening is that

1832
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,520
all the other cells,

1833
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:15,480
this one cell is saying,

1834
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,280
let's build an eye

1835
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:17,080
and all the others are saying,

1836
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,120
you're crazy, we're skinned.

1837
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,560
And depending on who wins,

1838
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,000
they have this back and forth interaction

1839
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:21,880
depending on who wins.

1840
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,400
And it's a cancer suppression mechanism.

1841
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,520
You don't want a lot of cells

1842
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,200
with weird voltages around.

1843
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:26,840
So in that case,

1844
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,040
it actually, there is a threshold.

1845
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,240
I don't have an exact number for you,

1846
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,160
but there is a threshold where

1847
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,760
if you're not in that threshold,

1848
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,920
the other cells are going to wipe out

1849
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,280
what you're trying to do.

1850
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,240
Mike, thank you so much.

1851
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,520
I know we've kept you one minute over.

1852
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,480
I remind you of your time.

1853
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,560
This was absolutely mind-boggling as usual.

1854
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,640
I can't wait to have you back whenever you're ready.

1855
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:43,960
Any time.

1856
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,400
Thanks everyone for your great questions.

1857
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,760
This was absolutely fantastic.

1858
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:47,240
Thank you.

1859
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:48,200
I see you for the next one.

1860
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:48,760
Thank you, Shanky.

1861
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,320
Thank you.

1862
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:49,880
Thank you so much.

1863
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:50,600
Thank you, everybody.

1864
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:50,840
Yeah.

1865
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:52,440
Anytime we can have an in-depth talk

1866
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,800
about bot staging with everyone.

1867
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,160
So thanks, everyone.
