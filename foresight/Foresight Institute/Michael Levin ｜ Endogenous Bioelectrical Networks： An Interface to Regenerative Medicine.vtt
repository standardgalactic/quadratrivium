00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
Welcome, everyone, to Fossett's biotech seminar series.

00:03.400 --> 00:05.280
Really excited to have Michael Levin here again.

00:05.280 --> 00:08.160
I discovered your work, I think, about five years ago

00:08.160 --> 00:09.960
in one of your New Europe's presentations

00:09.960 --> 00:11.440
on what bodies think about.

00:11.440 --> 00:12.760
Was totally startled by it.

00:12.760 --> 00:14.840
Could not believe what you were discussing there

00:14.840 --> 00:17.360
until we had you on, I think, two or three years ago,

00:17.360 --> 00:19.480
for Fossett's seminar a while back.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.200
Also, I think the topic was taming

00:21.200 --> 00:22.720
the collective intelligence of self

00:22.720 --> 00:25.440
with a focus also on possible regeneration

00:25.440 --> 00:26.840
and longevity implications.

00:26.840 --> 00:29.240
Since then, I have contacted you quite a few times

00:29.240 --> 00:31.680
to ask if you want to nominate Fossett,

00:31.680 --> 00:33.440
because we really want to explore a little bit more

00:33.440 --> 00:36.640
the longevity and, like, bio-angle of much of your work.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.280
Since then, you have not stopped working.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.480
In fact, quite the opposite.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.720
You have now produced some really mind-boggling bits

00:41.720 --> 00:44.080
on Xenobots and Amphobots ever since.

00:44.080 --> 00:46.200
And so hopefully, we may get into some of that

00:46.200 --> 00:47.480
also during the Q&A.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.760
And then most recently, you were on a cognitive revolution

00:49.760 --> 00:52.480
podcast and discussed some of the implications of your work

00:52.480 --> 00:55.680
for AI, and especially for a new and bio-inspired approach

00:55.680 --> 00:56.560
to intelligence.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.040
That was really interesting.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.600
We have launched our AI safety grant since then.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.960
And many, not many, but a few of the applications

01:02.960 --> 01:06.560
actually actively referenced your work in the AI applications.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.800
So I'm just really excited to discuss, hopefully, some

01:09.800 --> 01:10.880
of these things in the Q&A.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.640
But for now, please take it away.

01:12.640 --> 01:13.760
Thank you so much for joining.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.520
Today, are you discussing indulgence

01:15.520 --> 01:18.360
in bio-electrical networks and interface

01:18.360 --> 01:19.800
to regenerative medicine?

01:19.800 --> 01:21.880
And hopefully, we can tease out some of the longevity

01:21.880 --> 01:24.120
implications and some of the AI implications

01:24.120 --> 01:25.080
afterwards in the Q&A.

01:25.080 --> 01:26.240
Thanks a lot for joining.

01:26.240 --> 01:27.560
We are big fans of your work.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.200
And please take it away.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.080
Thank you so much.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.920
That's a very kind introduction.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.800
Thank you so much for having me here.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.080
I'm very excited to share some ideas with you.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.240
And what I'd like to talk to you about

01:38.240 --> 01:40.440
is basically the following point.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.200
That I'm going to make the argument

01:42.200 --> 01:45.240
that bodies consist of a kind of multi-scale competency

01:45.240 --> 01:46.280
architecture.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.600
And the key element of this is that there's

01:48.600 --> 01:50.640
problem-solving intelligence at every level,

01:50.640 --> 01:54.640
from the molecular networks to organs and swarms and so on.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.080
I'm going to make the argument that definitive regenerative

01:57.080 --> 01:58.640
medicine is really going to require

01:58.640 --> 02:00.920
us to exploit this collective intelligence.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.920
What it amounts to is communicating

02:02.920 --> 02:06.720
our anatomical goals in morphospace to the cells.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.400
And the particular interface that we exploit

02:09.400 --> 02:12.080
is the endogenous bio-electrical networks that

02:12.080 --> 02:14.240
are present in all tissues.

02:14.240 --> 02:17.400
This is an extremely tractable and powerful interface

02:17.400 --> 02:18.640
for top-down control.

02:18.640 --> 02:19.960
And I'm going to show you the tools

02:19.960 --> 02:22.840
that we've made to read and write the pattern memories

02:22.840 --> 02:25.800
into what is basically the protocognitive medium

02:25.840 --> 02:28.040
of the collective intelligence of cells.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.200
I'm going to show you some beginning applications

02:30.200 --> 02:34.000
in areas like birth defects, regenerative repair, cancer.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
And we can talk about how these are heading towards biomedicine.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.360
So in order to heal and restore function,

02:39.360 --> 02:41.880
we really need to understand the agential material

02:41.880 --> 02:43.880
we're working with because it's completely

02:43.880 --> 02:45.400
different than the kind of engineering

02:45.400 --> 02:46.680
we've done in the past.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.680
So for thousands of years, we worked with passive materials.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.240
And the thing about passive materials

02:51.240 --> 02:53.800
is that the only thing you can rely on them to do

02:53.800 --> 02:55.720
is to stay where you put them.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.440
And so it's on you as the engineer,

02:57.440 --> 02:59.600
like with, let's say, Legos or wood or metal

02:59.600 --> 03:01.600
to put them exactly where you want them.

03:01.600 --> 03:03.200
And at best, they're going to remain there.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.320
And you have to be the one to implement

03:05.320 --> 03:07.320
all the different functionalities.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.440
But engineers have increasingly started working on

03:10.440 --> 03:13.520
with active matter and even computational materials.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.920
And for us, bio-engineers and workers

03:15.920 --> 03:19.360
in regenerative medicine, we work in agential material.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.400
And you can imagine right away how different

03:21.400 --> 03:23.840
that type of engineering is when you think about

03:23.880 --> 03:26.480
what it takes to build a tower out of Legos

03:26.480 --> 03:28.440
versus a tower out of dogs.

03:28.440 --> 03:31.160
If you build a tower out of Legos, it's very straightforward.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.560
You put everything where it goes.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.840
But if that tower falls over, that's the end.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.280
And you can't really expect it to do anything beyond that.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.720
The dogs initially are absolutely not going to stay

03:39.720 --> 03:42.520
where you put them, but they offer an amazing interface

03:42.520 --> 03:45.200
having to do with training and memory and learning.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.440
And if you train them to stand on top of each other,

03:47.440 --> 03:50.440
then once you knock the tower over, they'll get back up

03:50.440 --> 03:52.760
and they'll do the thing they're supposed to do.

03:52.760 --> 03:55.520
And so you can see the pros and cons of this.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.760
It requires you to really understand your material

03:57.760 --> 04:00.560
to know which type of techniques you're going to use.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.920
And people argue a lot about this notion

04:02.920 --> 04:04.840
of whether bodies are actually machines,

04:04.840 --> 04:07.520
if there's a difference between machines and organisms.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.920
And I don't believe that these are absolute binary categories

04:10.920 --> 04:14.160
in any way, but what we want is a plethora of approaches

04:14.160 --> 04:15.000
at the right levels.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.120
You definitely want an orthopedic surgeon

04:17.120 --> 04:18.720
who believes your body is a machine

04:18.720 --> 04:20.360
because they get to use tools like this.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.040
They use chisels and screws and hammers and so on.

04:23.040 --> 04:24.880
But what you don't want is a psychoanalyst

04:24.880 --> 04:26.640
who thinks you're that kind of machine, right?

04:26.640 --> 04:29.280
And so different types of problems

04:29.280 --> 04:30.800
require different levels of solution.

04:30.800 --> 04:34.440
And after the orthopedic surgeon does their thing,

04:34.440 --> 04:36.600
they then send you home to heal.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.240
And it is that part, the part that we don't micromanage,

04:39.240 --> 04:40.960
that is the really interesting part

04:40.960 --> 04:43.760
where the collective intelligence of the bodies

04:43.760 --> 04:44.880
really takes hold.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.680
And ultimately, we can discuss this at the end.

04:47.680 --> 04:48.680
I won't get into it here,

04:48.680 --> 04:51.120
but the people who work on placebo and nocebo effects

04:51.120 --> 04:53.600
and so on, like Fabrizio Benedetti,

04:53.600 --> 04:56.840
says words and drugs have the same mechanism of action.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.000
And this is extremely deep

04:58.000 --> 05:00.040
because what this is reminding us of

05:00.040 --> 05:02.480
is that there is a multi-scale architecture

05:02.480 --> 05:05.160
that has a language understanding at the top

05:05.160 --> 05:06.720
and all kinds of other levels

05:06.720 --> 05:09.160
eventually reaching the molecular level.

05:09.160 --> 05:12.200
And our body is actually an amazing architecture

05:12.200 --> 05:15.240
that lets your high level executive goals,

05:15.240 --> 05:17.680
for example, social goals, scientific goals and so on,

05:17.680 --> 05:20.720
to literally move calcium and other ions

05:20.720 --> 05:22.720
across your membranes and your cells

05:22.720 --> 05:25.160
so that you can walk and do voluntary motion

05:25.160 --> 05:27.440
and go about your day to try to achieve those goals.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.640
So our body has that kind of architecture

05:29.640 --> 05:33.480
that literally links mental, long range mental goals

05:33.480 --> 05:35.240
to the movement of chemicals

05:35.240 --> 05:37.520
that allow you to enact those goals.

05:37.520 --> 05:41.040
So across this, what I call the spectrum of persuadability

05:41.040 --> 05:45.440
because it puts the emphasis on how we are going to use

05:45.440 --> 05:46.680
different types of tools

05:46.680 --> 05:49.200
to get the system to do various things.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.280
Across that spectrum of persuadability,

05:51.280 --> 05:52.960
we have many different waypoints.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.320
You have simple machines, you have homeostats

05:55.320 --> 05:56.640
and then you have learning agents

05:56.640 --> 05:59.720
and then you have rational thinkers and planners and so on

05:59.720 --> 06:02.040
and completely different sets of tools.

06:02.040 --> 06:06.280
So hardware rewiring here and then cybernetics here

06:06.280 --> 06:09.280
and maybe control theory and then behavioral science

06:09.280 --> 06:11.600
and then maybe other interesting things

06:11.600 --> 06:14.040
like psychiatry and so on.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.640
So one might ask the question,

06:15.640 --> 06:18.880
where do cellular collectives fit into this spectrum?

06:18.880 --> 06:21.160
The assumption, and I think most people make this assumption

06:21.160 --> 06:22.760
is that it's got to be somewhere here,

06:22.760 --> 06:24.760
maybe a little bit here,

06:24.760 --> 06:27.080
but I want to really emphasize the idea

06:27.080 --> 06:28.720
that is very much an assumption.

06:28.720 --> 06:30.640
That is a philosophical commitment.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.040
The thing we need to do as scientists and engineers

06:33.040 --> 06:33.880
is do experiments.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.520
We need to find out where they fit

06:35.520 --> 06:37.440
because my claim is that humans

06:37.440 --> 06:39.600
are actually not very good at guessing these things.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.960
So we need to do experiments

06:40.960 --> 06:44.160
and that amounts to asking what tools in particular

06:44.160 --> 06:46.040
the tools of these other disciplines

06:46.040 --> 06:49.000
are really powerful in getting cellular collectives

06:49.000 --> 06:50.680
to do interesting things.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.720
Now, as we start to talk about intelligence,

06:52.720 --> 06:54.880
it's important to work backwards.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.560
So here we are, if we believe that we are high level

06:57.560 --> 07:00.200
metacognitive beings with true goals and memories

07:00.200 --> 07:01.400
and preferences and so on.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.440
So here we are, where did all those things come from?

07:04.440 --> 07:07.560
Working backwards, both evolutionarily and developmentally,

07:07.560 --> 07:08.560
they came from here.

07:08.560 --> 07:12.160
We were all once a single unfertilized OSI.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.440
So people look at this cell

07:13.440 --> 07:15.040
and they see a little blob of chemistry

07:15.040 --> 07:18.240
and they say that really just obeys the laws of physics.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.640
There is no cognition there.

07:20.640 --> 07:24.040
But the deepest lesson of developmental biology

07:24.040 --> 07:26.280
is that there is no magic lightning flash

07:26.280 --> 07:28.640
during this process at which you go from being

07:28.640 --> 07:32.120
quote unquote, just physics to having a complex mind.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.640
So that means our goal,

07:33.640 --> 07:35.240
and we all make this journey across

07:35.240 --> 07:37.360
this so-called Cartesian cut.

07:37.360 --> 07:41.000
So that means that our goal is to really understand

07:41.000 --> 07:42.160
the scaling of minds.

07:42.160 --> 07:45.040
We really need to understand how the primitive competencies

07:45.040 --> 07:47.160
of molecular networks and single cells

07:47.160 --> 07:50.400
slowly but surely become large scale competencies

07:50.400 --> 07:53.320
in new problem spaces.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.520
And this is something that I think Turing

07:55.520 --> 07:56.920
actually understood quite well,

07:56.920 --> 07:58.920
although he didn't talk about it much,

07:58.920 --> 08:01.040
that the self assembly of the body

08:01.040 --> 08:03.560
and the self assembly and the scale up of minds

08:03.560 --> 08:04.880
is really the same problem.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.600
This is why the father of computer science

08:07.600 --> 08:09.160
who thought a lot about intelligence

08:09.160 --> 08:12.240
and mathematics and thinking and so on

08:12.240 --> 08:15.360
also had a paper on self-organization of chemicals

08:15.360 --> 08:16.880
in an embryogenesis.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.400
I think he was onto this.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.560
This is the kind of stuff that we are made of.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.520
This happens to be a free living organism,

08:22.520 --> 08:25.160
but I just wanna show you, this is a lacrimaria.

08:25.160 --> 08:28.200
I wanna show you what a single cell is capable of.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.480
No brain, no nervous system.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.280
Everything is handled in one cell.

08:32.280 --> 08:37.080
So all of this animals, morphological, physiological,

08:37.080 --> 08:40.920
anatomical, metabolic needs are handled within one cell.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.400
And we have to ask ourselves the question

08:43.400 --> 08:46.440
of what connection policies are there for beings

08:46.440 --> 08:48.560
with their own agendas and their own competencies

08:48.560 --> 08:51.080
to get together and do larger scale things.

08:51.080 --> 08:54.440
Interestingly, intelligence does not appear first

08:54.440 --> 08:55.640
in whole cells.

08:55.640 --> 08:58.040
In fact, even gene regulatory networks,

08:58.040 --> 08:59.520
and you can see the details in these papers,

08:59.520 --> 09:01.320
even gene regulatory networks,

09:01.320 --> 09:02.800
if you look at them correctly

09:02.800 --> 09:04.920
or if you look at them the right way,

09:04.920 --> 09:07.440
you can actually discover six different kinds of learning

09:07.440 --> 09:09.400
that simple pathways can do.

09:09.400 --> 09:12.480
So no need for cells, no need for plasma membranes

09:12.480 --> 09:15.320
or any of that, just a small number of nodes

09:15.320 --> 09:18.120
turning each other on and off is already sufficient

09:18.120 --> 09:20.920
to do things like associative conditioning.

09:20.920 --> 09:23.080
And that has massive implications for biomedicine,

09:23.080 --> 09:24.680
which we can talk about.

09:24.680 --> 09:25.840
So the first part of this talk,

09:25.840 --> 09:28.920
I want to focus on the competencies of the material.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.520
I wanna really drill down and show off

09:31.520 --> 09:34.720
some of the amazing kinds of capabilities of the material

09:34.720 --> 09:36.800
that we're dealing with because that bears on

09:36.800 --> 09:39.600
what kind of technologies are possible.

09:39.600 --> 09:43.360
Here's one example of the implications

09:43.360 --> 09:44.960
of being made of this kind of material.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.800
So this is a tappel of the frog,

09:46.800 --> 09:47.880
you'll see a lot of those today.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.520
So here are the nostrils, here's the mouth,

09:49.520 --> 09:50.960
here's the brain, the gut.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.440
What you'll notice is that we've prevented

09:52.440 --> 09:54.400
the primary eyes from forming here,

09:54.400 --> 09:56.360
but we put an eye on his tail.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.360
And it turns out that these animals can see perfectly,

09:59.360 --> 10:01.360
well, we test them in this machine that we built,

10:01.360 --> 10:03.280
we built a custom machine to train

10:03.280 --> 10:05.040
and test them on visual cues.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.120
They can see because they can learn to perform

10:07.120 --> 10:08.680
in these visual assays.

10:08.680 --> 10:11.200
This ectopic eye does not connect to the brain,

10:11.200 --> 10:13.120
it will often make us an optic nerve

10:13.120 --> 10:15.880
that can connect and synapse on the spinal cord here.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.720
So think about the amazing plasticity here,

10:17.720 --> 10:21.040
without new generations of adaptation, selection,

10:21.040 --> 10:22.520
this animal out of the gate

10:22.520 --> 10:25.600
with a completely different sensory motor architecture,

10:25.600 --> 10:27.800
that brain realizes that the information

10:27.800 --> 10:29.240
being put onto its spinal cord

10:29.240 --> 10:32.040
by this weird itchy patch of posterior tissue

10:32.040 --> 10:35.520
is good enough to understand its world as visual data

10:35.520 --> 10:37.800
and is able to process and behave accordingly.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.240
That plasticity is a major theme here.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.800
Another example of plasticity

10:41.800 --> 10:44.600
that dissolves the distinction between memory

10:44.600 --> 10:48.320
and body structure can be seen in planaria.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.920
These flatworms, one of the main amazing characteristics

10:50.920 --> 10:52.680
that they have is that they regenerate.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.080
So you can cut them into pieces

10:54.080 --> 10:57.160
and each piece will give rise to a complete worm.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.240
So one thing that was known since the 60s

10:59.240 --> 11:01.520
is that if you train them on a particular task,

11:01.520 --> 11:03.960
for example, to look for food around these bumpy little,

11:03.960 --> 11:05.600
these laser-etched little areas,

11:05.600 --> 11:07.520
so place conditioning basically,

11:07.520 --> 11:09.800
you cut off their head in their centralized brain,

11:09.800 --> 11:11.720
the tail will sit there not doing anything

11:11.720 --> 11:13.600
other than growing a brand new head

11:13.600 --> 11:15.760
and a little bit more than a week later,

11:15.760 --> 11:16.800
they've grown back in your head

11:16.800 --> 11:19.280
and you find out that these animals remember perfectly well

11:19.280 --> 11:22.080
where the liver was, which is what they eat.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.200
What we see here is the amazing ability

11:24.200 --> 11:26.280
to not only regenerate your memories,

11:26.280 --> 11:29.520
but to imprint whatever information is present,

11:29.520 --> 11:31.120
presumably in the rest of the body

11:31.120 --> 11:32.960
so that we don't know yet where it is,

11:32.960 --> 11:34.560
but to imprint that information

11:34.560 --> 11:36.920
onto a newly growing brain.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.480
So think about what that might mean

11:38.480 --> 11:40.400
for future therapeutics when a patient

11:40.400 --> 11:42.560
with six or seven decades of memories,

11:42.560 --> 11:46.360
of personality, of history suddenly has a large chunk

11:46.360 --> 11:50.240
of their brain replaced with the descendants of stem cells.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.200
In terms of, are you still going to get the same,

11:52.200 --> 11:53.920
the same individual?

11:53.920 --> 11:55.720
Is it going to be more like a newborn baby?

11:55.720 --> 11:57.600
What these kind of models suggest

11:57.600 --> 12:00.440
that actually memories might persist quite well.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.160
In fact, it's even more impressive what happens

12:03.160 --> 12:06.160
in the caterpillar to butterfly transition.

12:06.160 --> 12:09.360
These animals start out as a kind of two-dimensional,

12:09.360 --> 12:11.720
it's a creature that lives in a two-dimensional world.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.720
It crawls around and eats leaves

12:13.720 --> 12:15.840
and it has a brain that's suitable for that.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.960
Eventually it has to metamorphose

12:17.960 --> 12:19.920
into a much different animal.

12:19.920 --> 12:21.840
So this is like a soft-bodied robot.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.320
It has no hard components.

12:23.320 --> 12:24.400
This is completely different.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.440
The movement types are entirely different.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.040
This is a hard-bodied creature.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.280
It flies in the 3D world, it drinks nectar.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.640
And during this process, the brain is basically dissolved.

12:33.640 --> 12:34.920
Most of the connections are broken.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.440
Most of the cells are killed off.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.080
A new brain is rebuilt.

12:38.080 --> 12:41.120
But the remarkable part is not only do the butterflies

12:41.120 --> 12:45.520
remember the training that the caterpillars received,

12:45.520 --> 12:47.560
but actually they remap that training

12:47.560 --> 12:50.120
with new salience onto a new body plant.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.960
Because if you train these caterpillars to associate,

12:52.960 --> 12:56.320
for example, a particular color stimulus with leaves,

12:56.320 --> 12:57.960
what the butterfly doesn't care about leaves,

12:57.960 --> 13:01.640
what the butterfly remembers is to go look for food

13:01.640 --> 13:03.440
on those same color discs.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.680
So that information is actually generalized,

13:05.680 --> 13:08.040
not leaves, but food, the category food,

13:08.040 --> 13:10.240
and remapped onto the new food,

13:10.240 --> 13:12.800
more appropriate to the different body structure.

13:12.800 --> 13:16.360
So this is not just a matter of where does the information

13:16.360 --> 13:17.880
stay during brain remodeling.

13:17.880 --> 13:18.960
That's the first question.

13:18.960 --> 13:19.840
But the second question is,

13:19.840 --> 13:22.280
how does that information get remapped

13:22.280 --> 13:24.440
onto the new life of this individual?

13:24.440 --> 13:25.920
And so you can think about what that means,

13:25.920 --> 13:28.640
the ability to remap information onto new bodies.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.880
Think human augmentation, new embodiments for future humans,

13:31.880 --> 13:33.080
brain modification,

13:33.080 --> 13:36.040
and how the information is going to persist.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.840
So what we have, again, in biology

13:38.840 --> 13:40.320
is this multi-scale architecture

13:40.320 --> 13:42.800
where all the way from molecular networks,

13:42.800 --> 13:46.600
all the way up, every layer is a problem-solving system.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.560
They're not just structurally different size scales.

13:49.560 --> 13:52.160
They actually have competencies to solve problems

13:52.160 --> 13:53.720
in different spaces.

13:53.720 --> 13:57.040
And there are multiple spaces that they operate in,

13:57.040 --> 14:00.200
gene transcription spaces, a physiological state space.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.720
We're going to spend most of the time talking

14:02.720 --> 14:04.640
about this anatomical morpho space,

14:04.640 --> 14:05.920
but just to remind us that,

14:05.920 --> 14:07.280
to really be humble about this,

14:07.280 --> 14:09.680
because we humans are okay

14:09.680 --> 14:13.640
at recognizing the intelligence of medium-sized objects

14:13.640 --> 14:16.200
moving at medium speeds in three-dimensional space.

14:16.200 --> 14:19.560
So crows and dogs and horses and maybe an octopus,

14:19.560 --> 14:20.480
maybe a whale.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.600
But we're really not very good

14:22.680 --> 14:24.760
at recognizing intelligence in these other spaces

14:24.760 --> 14:27.880
because all of our sense organs are very much aimed

14:27.880 --> 14:30.920
at this kind of a one-narrow range of embodiments.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.320
And I often like to think that if we had evolved

14:33.320 --> 14:36.840
with a primary sensor of our blood chemistry

14:36.840 --> 14:38.440
so that you can feel the blood chemistry,

14:38.440 --> 14:40.520
the way that we currently see and hear and so on,

14:40.520 --> 14:42.920
I think we would have no problem recognizing

14:42.920 --> 14:45.880
that we live in a multi-dimensional space

14:45.880 --> 14:48.200
and that our liver and our kidneys are, in fact,

14:48.200 --> 14:51.320
intelligent agents that navigate that space adaptively

14:51.880 --> 14:54.120
in terms of all the different things that happen to us.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.000
So we're going to look at anatomical morpho space,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.640
and which is basically just a multi-dimensional space

14:59.640 --> 15:01.400
of all the different possible shapes

15:01.400 --> 15:03.160
that something could undertake.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.760
And we're gonna ask a basic question.

15:04.760 --> 15:07.800
This is a cross-section through a human torso.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.480
So look at this amazing order.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.480
All these different organs are almost always

15:11.480 --> 15:14.440
in the right shape, the right size, next to the right thing.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.040
But we start out life like this,

15:16.040 --> 15:18.200
a collection of embryonic blastomers.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.800
Where does this pattern come from?

15:19.800 --> 15:21.240
Where does it encode it?

15:21.320 --> 15:24.440
And when I give this, I've given versions of this talk

15:24.440 --> 15:25.960
to our middle school children,

15:25.960 --> 15:27.560
and even the nine-year-olds immediately say,

15:27.560 --> 15:28.520
oh, it's in the DNA.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.360
They say it's in the genome.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.240
But the thing is, we can sequence genomes now.

15:33.240 --> 15:35.640
It was always clear, really, that this was not in the genome.

15:35.640 --> 15:38.200
But a lot of scientists talk as if that's the case.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.600
And now we know when you read the genome,

15:40.600 --> 15:43.240
you don't see any of this, which is protein structure.

15:43.240 --> 15:46.360
You see the description of the tiniest molecular hardware

15:46.360 --> 15:47.560
that every cell gets to have.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.080
You don't see directly information

15:49.080 --> 15:51.000
about size, shape, symmetry type.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.280
And so we need to understand how do these cells,

15:54.280 --> 15:56.280
this genomically specified hardware,

15:56.280 --> 15:58.040
how does it know what to build?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.560
How does it know when to stop?

15:59.560 --> 16:02.280
If something is missing, how do we convince it to rebuild?

16:02.280 --> 16:04.280
And as engineers, we want to go one step further

16:04.280 --> 16:05.960
and ask, what else could you build?

16:05.960 --> 16:07.880
If we wanted to build something completely different

16:07.880 --> 16:09.880
out of the same parts, could you?

16:09.880 --> 16:12.680
Or all this talk of developmental constraints,

16:12.680 --> 16:15.960
is that really a confining paradigm?

16:16.760 --> 16:20.280
So let's think about what the future is supposed to look like.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.720
What's the end game for this field?

16:21.720 --> 16:24.120
I think that what we're talking about

16:24.120 --> 16:26.680
is something we call an anatomical compiler.

16:26.680 --> 16:29.320
So the idea is that someday you will sit down

16:29.320 --> 16:33.960
in front of a software system and draw the plant, animal,

16:33.960 --> 16:36.120
organ, or biobot that you want to build.

16:36.120 --> 16:39.400
In this case, we've drawn a three-headed flatworm.

16:39.400 --> 16:42.360
So having drawn the anatomy, the functional anatomy

16:42.360 --> 16:44.200
that you want, what the system should be able to do

16:44.200 --> 16:47.640
is compile that down to a set of stimuli

16:47.720 --> 16:50.520
that could be given to cells to build that structure.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.800
So not a 3D printer.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.120
This is not about micromanaging where the cells go.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.200
This is about convincing a group of cells

16:56.200 --> 16:58.200
to build exactly what you want them to build

16:58.200 --> 17:00.920
and not whatever it was that they were going to build before.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.280
So two key questions first.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.480
Why do we even need this thing?

17:03.480 --> 17:06.120
Because not only for the understanding of evolution

17:06.120 --> 17:07.160
and information and so on,

17:07.160 --> 17:10.120
but very practically most biomedical problems.

17:10.120 --> 17:12.840
So birth defects, traumatic injury, cancer, aging,

17:12.840 --> 17:15.640
degenerative disease, all of these things would go away

17:15.640 --> 17:18.680
if we knew how to convince groups of cells to build

17:18.680 --> 17:20.840
whatever organs we wanted them to build.

17:20.840 --> 17:24.200
Now, the other question might be, why don't we have this yet?

17:24.200 --> 17:26.200
Genetics and molecular biology

17:26.200 --> 17:28.440
has been going gangbusters for decades.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.040
Why do we not have this thing yet?

17:30.040 --> 17:33.080
I just want to illustrate one simple puzzle.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.240
This is the axolotl larvae

17:35.240 --> 17:37.400
and baby axolotls have little forelegs.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.320
This is a tadpole of the frog.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.880
At this stage, these guys do not have forelegs.

17:41.880 --> 17:44.040
In my lab, we make something called a frogolotl.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.160
So if we make a frogolotl,

17:45.160 --> 17:47.000
it's got a bunch of embryonic cells from here,

17:47.000 --> 17:48.600
a bunch of embryonic cells from here,

17:48.600 --> 17:50.280
and you get a chimeric embryo.

17:50.920 --> 17:53.400
Now, the axolotl genome is sequenced.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.400
The frog genome has been sequenced.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.360
Very simple question.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.720
You've got both sequences.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.240
Could you tell me whether a frogolotl

17:59.240 --> 18:00.680
is going to have legs or not?

18:00.680 --> 18:01.560
And the answer is no.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.560
We have no way currently of knowing

18:03.560 --> 18:05.080
the answer to these kind of questions.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.600
In fact, if you didn't already know

18:06.600 --> 18:08.520
what a tadpole or an axolotl looked like,

18:08.520 --> 18:09.960
you couldn't even give me the shape of it

18:09.960 --> 18:11.240
from looking at the genome.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.120
It's very important to understand

18:12.120 --> 18:13.480
what kind of information we have

18:13.560 --> 18:15.240
and what kind of information we do not have.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.600
So the state of the field currently is this.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.400
We are very good at manipulating cells and molecules.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.040
And all of the most exciting advances today

18:24.040 --> 18:25.080
are about the hardware.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.960
Everybody's really into genomic editing,

18:27.960 --> 18:30.520
pathway remodeling, protein engineering.

18:30.520 --> 18:31.720
All of these things are hardware.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.640
They're focused at the molecular hardware level,

18:34.360 --> 18:37.480
like where computer science was in the 40s and 50s.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.640
So this is what programming used to look like.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.200
She's physically rewiring this machine.

18:42.200 --> 18:44.360
Now, the reason nowadays, when you're on your laptop

18:44.360 --> 18:45.880
and you want to go from, I don't know,

18:45.880 --> 18:48.040
PowerPoint to Microsoft Word,

18:48.040 --> 18:49.720
the reason you don't get out your soldering iron

18:49.720 --> 18:52.520
and start rewiring is because computer science

18:52.520 --> 18:54.120
took advantage of something remarkable,

18:54.120 --> 18:56.600
the fact that certain kinds of hardware

18:56.600 --> 18:59.720
are reprogrammable and in fact can support

18:59.720 --> 19:05.400
a layered, multi-scale, modular set of software,

19:05.400 --> 19:07.640
or in our case, it's going to be physiology,

19:07.640 --> 19:09.960
that allows you to do interesting things

19:09.960 --> 19:12.120
with the exactly the same piece of hardware

19:12.120 --> 19:13.160
without rewiring.

19:13.160 --> 19:14.600
So this is what we're missing now.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.320
But I'm going to argue that molecular medicine

19:17.320 --> 19:18.280
is basically here.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.680
I spoke to a major investor once who said that

19:21.320 --> 19:23.800
in their firm, they think of biology today,

19:23.800 --> 19:26.440
where computer science was in the year 2000.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.360
And I think that's, that isn't as way wrong.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.800
I think it's where we were in the 40s and 50s.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.320
We can go a much higher than this.

19:33.320 --> 19:34.920
And the thing that's still missing

19:34.920 --> 19:37.000
is to understand the biological softwares,

19:37.000 --> 19:38.440
to understand the intelligence

19:38.440 --> 19:39.560
that we can take advantage of.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.560
So when I say intelligence, what do I?

19:41.560 --> 19:43.480
William James's nice definition,

19:43.480 --> 19:45.720
which is the ability to reach the same goal

19:45.720 --> 19:46.840
by different means.

19:46.840 --> 19:48.440
It's a very cybernetic definition.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.040
It doesn't talk about what kind of brain you have,

19:50.040 --> 19:51.160
or whether you have a cortex,

19:51.160 --> 19:53.560
or what space you're even working in.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.320
Same goal by different means.

19:55.320 --> 19:58.200
The ability to reach certain states in that space

19:58.200 --> 20:00.920
when faced with interventions, when things change.

20:00.920 --> 20:04.120
How much competency do you have to still get your job done?

20:04.120 --> 20:06.440
So let's look, what kind of collective intelligence

20:06.440 --> 20:08.360
can we find in cellular swarms?

20:08.360 --> 20:10.760
What are the capabilities of our system

20:10.760 --> 20:11.960
that we're trying to rewire?

20:11.960 --> 20:13.560
What's the toolkit that we have?

20:13.560 --> 20:16.200
This is one of my all-time favorite examples.

20:16.840 --> 20:20.440
This is a cross-section through a kidney tubule of a nut,

20:20.440 --> 20:23.000
and eight to 10 cells normally making this thing up.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.640
One thing you can do to early embryos

20:25.640 --> 20:29.640
is multiply the amount of DNA in their nuclei.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.160
So if you can make a polyploid,

20:31.160 --> 20:33.880
nutes that have two and four and six and so on.

20:33.880 --> 20:36.200
If you do that, the cells become larger,

20:36.200 --> 20:37.400
and you find out that,

20:37.400 --> 20:39.240
actually, you still get the same size nut,

20:39.240 --> 20:41.640
and that's because fewer cells get together

20:41.640 --> 20:43.800
and make the same anatomical structure.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.400
So amazing thing, number one,

20:45.400 --> 20:47.960
is that you could have multiple copies of your genome

20:47.960 --> 20:49.560
that doesn't seem to mess anything up.

20:49.560 --> 20:52.600
Number two, you could have abnormally large cells,

20:52.600 --> 20:53.560
and they still figure out

20:53.560 --> 20:55.640
how many of them there need to be to do this.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.240
But the most amazing thing

20:57.240 --> 20:59.080
is that if you make the cells truly gigantic,

20:59.080 --> 21:01.560
and I think this is maybe six and nutes.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.160
If you make the cells truly gigantic,

21:03.960 --> 21:05.640
what they will do is wrap around themselves

21:05.640 --> 21:07.880
to give you the same anatomical structure.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.320
And what's remarkable about that

21:09.320 --> 21:11.240
is that this is a different molecular mechanism.

21:11.240 --> 21:14.040
This is cell-to-cell communication and tubular genesis.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.120
This is cytoskeletal bending.

21:16.120 --> 21:19.640
And so in the service of a large-scale anatomical goal,

21:19.640 --> 21:22.840
different molecular components are being called up.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.120
Now, just think about what this means.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.800
If you're a nude coming into the world,

21:25.800 --> 21:27.000
what can you rely on?

21:27.000 --> 21:29.080
We tend to think you've had eons of evolution,

21:29.080 --> 21:31.480
you've had all this experience with your environment.

21:31.480 --> 21:34.200
You can't count on how much DNA you have.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.680
You can't count on how many copies of anything you have.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.360
You can't count on your cell size.

21:38.360 --> 21:40.520
You can't count on how many cells you have.

21:40.520 --> 21:42.120
You have to be able to get your job done

21:42.120 --> 21:45.000
despite massive variation in your own parts.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
We don't have even the beginnings of technology

21:47.000 --> 21:49.800
that has that kind of problem-solving competencies

21:49.800 --> 21:50.760
and capacity.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.800
This is a more familiar example.

21:54.360 --> 21:57.720
We know that embryos reliably go from a single cell

21:57.720 --> 21:59.560
to a complex organism,

21:59.560 --> 22:01.160
but it's not a hardwired process.

22:01.160 --> 22:03.320
It's reliable, but it isn't hardwired.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.480
Because if you cut these embryos into pieces,

22:05.480 --> 22:07.400
you do not end up with half bodies.

22:07.400 --> 22:10.280
You end up with monozygotic twins and triplets.

22:10.280 --> 22:13.320
So what happens is that from different starting positions,

22:13.320 --> 22:16.040
and this is again called back to James' definition,

22:16.040 --> 22:17.560
from different starting positions,

22:17.560 --> 22:19.400
you can navigate that morpho space

22:19.400 --> 22:21.880
and get to that same ensemble of goal states

22:21.880 --> 22:26.680
that basically maps to a normal variation

22:26.680 --> 22:28.200
around the human target morphology.

22:29.240 --> 22:32.120
In many species, this is not just an embryonic thing.

22:32.120 --> 22:35.400
For example, axolotls can regenerate their legs,

22:35.400 --> 22:39.240
their eyes, their jaws, portions of their brain and heart,

22:39.240 --> 22:40.600
spinal cord ovaries.

22:40.600 --> 22:45.080
And what happens if they lose a limb anywhere along this axis,

22:45.080 --> 22:48.200
they will rebuild exactly as much as needed,

22:48.200 --> 22:49.720
whether from here or from here,

22:49.720 --> 22:51.640
from different starting positions they get here.

22:51.640 --> 22:53.960
And here's the most amazing thing about regeneration.

22:53.960 --> 22:56.760
And everybody's excited about cranking up regeneration

22:56.760 --> 22:58.520
for therapeutic purposes.

22:58.520 --> 23:01.480
But actually the most amazing thing about regeneration

23:01.480 --> 23:02.760
is that it stops.

23:02.760 --> 23:04.920
How does it know when to stop?

23:04.920 --> 23:07.800
It stops when the correct salamander arm has been completed,

23:07.800 --> 23:09.240
and that turns out to be very profound.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.840
Now, it's not as if this is just for frogs

23:12.840 --> 23:17.160
and salamanders and flatworms.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.320
The human liver is highly regenerative,

23:19.320 --> 23:20.840
even the ancient Greeks knew that.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.280
I'm not sure how, but they did.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.480
Human children regenerate their fingertips

23:25.480 --> 23:26.680
below a certain age.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.680
And deer, large adult mammals,

23:28.680 --> 23:32.360
regenerate a centimeter and a half of new bone per day

23:32.360 --> 23:34.120
when they're regrowing their antlers.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.760
So massive amount of regeneration of bone,

23:36.760 --> 23:38.680
vasculature, innervation, skin.

23:39.240 --> 23:42.360
So the final example that I want to show you before

23:42.360 --> 23:45.000
we go to the molecular mechanisms

23:45.000 --> 23:46.920
is what happens to the frog face.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.160
So this is a tadpole face, here are the eyes,

23:49.160 --> 23:50.680
the nostrils, the mouth.

23:50.680 --> 23:51.960
And here's what a frog looks like.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.760
And so to go from a tadpole to a frog,

23:54.760 --> 23:56.840
you need to rearrange the face.

23:56.840 --> 23:58.680
These animals, the jaws will move forward,

23:58.680 --> 24:00.760
the eyes move, everything moves around.

24:00.760 --> 24:03.240
And it used to be thought that this was

24:03.240 --> 24:04.840
a hardwired set of movements.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.720
If you just somehow code for every organ

24:07.720 --> 24:09.240
to move in that particular direction,

24:09.240 --> 24:10.760
a particular amount,

24:10.760 --> 24:13.000
then what will happen is you'll go from a normal tadpole

24:13.000 --> 24:14.280
to a normal frog.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.280
We decided to test this and to see actually

24:16.280 --> 24:17.800
how much intelligence does this have,

24:17.800 --> 24:20.200
and the way you test these things is with perturbations.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.680
So what we did was we made a scrambled tadpole

24:22.680 --> 24:24.760
called, we call them Picasso tadpoles,

24:24.760 --> 24:26.280
where everything is in the wrong place.

24:26.280 --> 24:28.440
The eyes on top of the head, the mouth is off to the side,

24:28.440 --> 24:30.280
everything is just completely shuffled,

24:30.280 --> 24:33.160
like a Mr. Potato Head doll scrambled around.

24:33.160 --> 24:34.920
And what happens is that these animals

24:34.920 --> 24:37.640
become quite normal frogs, actually,

24:37.640 --> 24:38.760
because all of these different things

24:38.760 --> 24:40.600
will move in normal paths,

24:40.600 --> 24:43.080
in rather abnormal paths,

24:43.080 --> 24:44.440
to get to where they need to go,

24:44.440 --> 24:45.640
and then the movement stops.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.280
So what the genetics gives you is not

24:48.280 --> 24:49.640
a set of hardwired movements.

24:49.640 --> 24:51.800
What the genetics actually specifies

24:51.800 --> 24:55.800
is a machine that can execute an error minimization scheme.

24:55.880 --> 24:57.880
It can continue to remodel

24:57.880 --> 25:00.280
until certain conditions are met.

25:00.280 --> 25:03.560
So those kind of data lead us to revise

25:03.560 --> 25:05.800
the basic loop of developmental biology.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.760
Normally what you have is there are genes acting

25:08.760 --> 25:09.880
in gene regulatory networks,

25:09.880 --> 25:11.720
they make some proteins that interact

25:11.720 --> 25:13.880
by the laws of physics, all of this is in parallel,

25:13.880 --> 25:15.960
and then this magical process of emergence

25:15.960 --> 25:17.640
happens and complexity arises,

25:17.640 --> 25:19.480
and then you have this beautiful organism.

25:19.480 --> 25:21.720
This view, this is what is focused upon

25:21.720 --> 25:23.240
in developmental biology textbooks,

25:23.960 --> 25:26.600
is an open loop feed forward process

25:26.600 --> 25:29.880
that rides along via emergence of complexity.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.200
And it is certainly true that there are many systems

25:32.200 --> 25:34.040
that will give you complexity

25:34.040 --> 25:36.840
from the repeated application of simple rules.

25:36.840 --> 25:37.640
There's plenty of that,

25:37.640 --> 25:39.720
but that's not where the magic is here,

25:40.360 --> 25:43.800
because what we find, which is a property

25:43.800 --> 25:46.280
that is not shared by all the computational models

25:46.280 --> 25:49.240
of feed forward emergence and complexity,

25:49.240 --> 25:52.520
is that if you deviate from this target morphology,

25:52.520 --> 25:53.720
and that can be with injury,

25:53.720 --> 25:56.280
it can be with mutations, with teratogens.

25:56.280 --> 25:59.720
In fact, one can propose that actually

25:59.720 --> 26:02.040
this kind of anatomical homeostasis

26:02.040 --> 26:05.080
and regenerative capacity was not about injury to start with.

26:05.080 --> 26:07.160
The reason this evolution has this

26:07.160 --> 26:10.520
is because this is how it was able to deal with mutations,

26:10.520 --> 26:12.280
the fact that you know that in your lineage

26:12.280 --> 26:15.240
you are going to experience changes of your internal parts.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.440
And if you can't deal with that,

26:16.440 --> 26:19.160
you're not going to live very long as a lineage.

26:19.160 --> 26:21.400
So what happens when you deviate from this,

26:21.400 --> 26:23.720
from this target morphology is that some mechanisms kick in

26:23.720 --> 26:26.120
both at the level of physics and genetics

26:26.120 --> 26:27.480
to try to reduce the error.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.160
It's literally like a thermostat in your house.

26:29.160 --> 26:32.200
It's an error minimization kind of process.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.200
Now, this is on the one hand,

26:34.200 --> 26:36.360
biologists know all about homeostatic loops.

26:36.360 --> 26:39.080
And of course, we recognize them in terms of pH regulation

26:39.080 --> 26:40.680
and temperature and hunger and all that.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.520
But there's a couple of unique things here.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.280
One is that, first of all,

26:44.280 --> 26:46.600
the set point of this homeostatic process

26:46.600 --> 26:47.560
is not a single number.

26:47.560 --> 26:50.520
It's not a scalar like for hunger or pH.

26:50.520 --> 26:52.520
It's a some kind of simplified version

26:52.520 --> 26:54.680
of a complex three-dimensional shape.

26:54.680 --> 26:57.800
How could we possibly store shape in a group of cells

26:57.800 --> 26:59.880
so that they know what they're supposed to build?

26:59.880 --> 27:01.240
Now, how do we store this set point?

27:01.800 --> 27:03.080
And then the other thing is that

27:03.080 --> 27:05.880
in developmental biology and cell biology,

27:05.880 --> 27:08.600
really discouraged from talking about goals

27:08.600 --> 27:10.600
and those kinds of teleological models.

27:10.600 --> 27:11.880
You're supposed to talk about chemistry

27:11.880 --> 27:13.480
and the way that chemistry rolls forward

27:13.480 --> 27:16.040
to produce emergent complexity.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.120
But it's really critical to realize now

27:18.200 --> 27:19.160
that since the 40s,

27:19.160 --> 27:21.560
we've had in cybernetics and control theory,

27:21.560 --> 27:24.840
we've had a mature science of machines with goals.

27:24.840 --> 27:27.800
It is no longer magical thinking to say

27:27.800 --> 27:30.120
that these kinds of processes have goals.

27:30.680 --> 27:33.880
That better be true because we also consist

27:33.880 --> 27:35.320
of these kinds of processes.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.280
And if they cannot support goal-directed behavior,

27:38.280 --> 27:41.480
then it's unclear what to say about our cognition either.

27:42.040 --> 27:43.960
This kind of weird view of looking at it

27:43.960 --> 27:45.080
to say that the development

27:45.080 --> 27:46.920
is actually a goal-directed process

27:46.920 --> 27:49.880
that moves towards a kind of target morphology

27:50.680 --> 27:51.720
makes a couple of predictions.

27:51.720 --> 27:54.440
It means that we should be able to find that mechanism.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.960
It means that we should be able to decode it and rewrite it.

27:57.960 --> 27:58.840
And if we rewrite it,

27:58.840 --> 28:00.520
something amazing becomes possible.

28:00.520 --> 28:03.000
It means that in order to make changes here,

28:03.000 --> 28:04.840
let's say for regenerative medicine,

28:04.840 --> 28:06.520
we don't need to change the genes.

28:06.520 --> 28:07.640
And that's really good

28:07.640 --> 28:09.240
because it is almost never clear

28:09.240 --> 28:10.520
how you would change the genes,

28:10.520 --> 28:12.600
even if CRISPR worked perfectly, which it will.

28:12.600 --> 28:13.960
At some point, the question is,

28:13.960 --> 28:15.160
which genes do you change

28:15.160 --> 28:17.080
to make the edits that you want out here?

28:17.080 --> 28:17.800
Instead of doing that,

28:17.800 --> 28:19.480
we could change the pattern memory

28:19.480 --> 28:21.080
and let the cells do what they do best,

28:21.080 --> 28:22.600
which is build to it.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.400
So we've now, for a couple of decades,

28:25.400 --> 28:26.680
we've been pushing this idea

28:27.320 --> 28:30.200
and exploring the predictions of this goal-directed behavior.

28:30.200 --> 28:32.120
So the first question we needed to ask

28:32.120 --> 28:35.160
is where could these pattern memories be stored?

28:35.160 --> 28:37.400
And we already have one clear example

28:37.400 --> 28:38.440
of collections of cells

28:38.440 --> 28:40.600
that store complex patterns

28:40.600 --> 28:42.760
as endpoints of goal-directed behavior,

28:42.760 --> 28:43.960
and that would be the brain.

28:43.960 --> 28:45.720
So in the brain, we know you have

28:45.720 --> 28:47.160
electrical networks of cells

28:47.160 --> 28:50.200
that produce action potentials

28:50.200 --> 28:51.800
and voltage gradients

28:51.800 --> 28:53.560
via ion channels across their surface.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.480
We call that ZMEM, the resting potential.

28:55.480 --> 28:57.560
And that supports an amazing kind of software.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.360
Here you can see in vivo physiology

29:00.360 --> 29:01.400
of a zebrafish brain,

29:02.360 --> 29:03.480
where people in neuroscience

29:03.480 --> 29:04.760
try to do neural decoding.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.520
The commitment of neuroscience

29:06.520 --> 29:08.440
is that if you could understand this physiology,

29:08.440 --> 29:10.840
you'd be able to decode the goals,

29:10.840 --> 29:13.640
memories, preferences, and so on of this kind of system.

29:13.720 --> 29:16.040
All the cognitive kinds of content

29:16.040 --> 29:17.240
you should be able to decode

29:17.240 --> 29:18.760
from this electrical activity.

29:18.760 --> 29:23.080
It turns out that nature really figured out

29:23.080 --> 29:24.360
that the electrical networks

29:24.360 --> 29:25.960
are really good for this kind of thing

29:25.960 --> 29:26.840
very early on.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.800
The electrical networks are not about neurons.

29:30.440 --> 29:33.160
They were here from the time of bacterial biofilms.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.720
And all cells in your body have ion channels

29:35.720 --> 29:37.880
and make resting potential gradients.

29:37.880 --> 29:40.360
Most of these cells are connected to each other

29:40.360 --> 29:42.440
through electrical synapses known as gap junctions.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.640
And could we run the same kind of research program?

29:45.640 --> 29:47.080
Could we look at, for example,

29:47.080 --> 29:48.920
in this case an early frog embryo

29:48.920 --> 29:51.400
and read out the electrical information

29:51.400 --> 29:54.120
and ask what could this cellular collective

29:54.120 --> 29:54.920
be thinking about?

29:54.920 --> 29:57.240
We know what this cellular collective thinks about.

29:57.240 --> 29:58.600
It largely thinks about movement

29:58.600 --> 30:00.120
through three-dimensional space.

30:00.120 --> 30:02.680
But embryos move through anatomical morphous space.

30:02.680 --> 30:05.480
So could we understand how the earlier version

30:05.480 --> 30:07.880
of this electrical system was used

30:07.880 --> 30:10.120
to compute and to move us through morphous space?

30:10.840 --> 30:11.960
So in our group,

30:11.960 --> 30:14.760
we developed several different kinds of tools

30:14.760 --> 30:17.000
first to read these patterns.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.040
And so here is a voltage-sensitive dye in time lapse

30:20.040 --> 30:22.520
showing you all the electrical conversations

30:22.520 --> 30:24.200
that these cells are having with each other

30:24.200 --> 30:27.240
to sort out where the different organs of the frog embryo

30:27.240 --> 30:28.040
are going to be.

30:28.040 --> 30:30.040
We do a lot of computational modeling

30:30.040 --> 30:31.960
to tie the molecular biology together

30:31.960 --> 30:34.520
with the voltage gradients that we observe

30:34.520 --> 30:36.920
and ask questions about a pattern completion.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.200
So if a part is deleted,

30:38.200 --> 30:40.680
how does the network remember the whole and so on?

30:41.560 --> 30:45.960
I'm going to show you two example patterns of this.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.960
So this is what we call the electric face.

30:47.960 --> 30:49.480
And this is a pattern of voltage.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.640
Again, the colors indicate resting potential.

30:52.680 --> 30:55.960
That this is one frame of the process

30:55.960 --> 30:58.600
by which this embryo puts his face together.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.560
And you can already see where everything is going to be.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.000
The right eye is going to be here.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.280
The placodes are out here.

31:04.280 --> 31:05.800
The mouth is going to be here.

31:05.800 --> 31:08.280
This is a subtle bioelectric pre-pattern

31:08.280 --> 31:10.920
that tells these cells where to turn on the genes

31:10.920 --> 31:14.360
if they have frizzles, BMPs, and so on to pattern the face.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.480
And it's absolutely required.

31:15.480 --> 31:17.320
If you change this pattern, the face changes.

31:17.320 --> 31:18.280
I'm going to show you that in a minute.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.280
Now, that's a normal pattern.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.680
There's also pathological patterns,

31:22.680 --> 31:24.840
such as when you inject an oncogene,

31:24.840 --> 31:27.720
you can actually detect the defection of these cells

31:27.720 --> 31:29.960
from the large-scale bioelectrical network

31:29.960 --> 31:32.920
and the impending metastasis and tumor genesis.

31:32.920 --> 31:34.200
You can see that here.

31:34.200 --> 31:37.720
So beyond reading and recording these kind of patterns,

31:37.720 --> 31:39.480
the key is to do functional perturbations,

31:39.480 --> 31:40.600
do interventions.

31:40.600 --> 31:43.400
And so for that reason, we developed some tools

31:43.400 --> 31:47.320
to now write the content into that electrical pattern.

31:47.320 --> 31:50.360
So just to link all of this back to the key concept

31:50.360 --> 31:51.880
from the beginning of the talk,

31:51.880 --> 31:55.640
we are literally treating the collective of cells

31:55.640 --> 31:58.760
during morphogenesis as a collective intelligence,

31:58.760 --> 32:02.360
which exerts behavior in anatomical morphospace.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.280
It moves the configuration of the body

32:04.280 --> 32:05.320
from that of a single cell

32:05.320 --> 32:08.600
to some whatever the complex animal it is or plant.

32:08.600 --> 32:11.480
And the idea is that this is literally behavior

32:11.480 --> 32:12.600
just in a different space.

32:12.600 --> 32:15.000
And we now want to read and write

32:15.000 --> 32:17.640
the primitive mind of that collective intelligence.

32:18.360 --> 32:19.560
So how do we do this?

32:19.560 --> 32:22.040
No magnets, electromagnetic fields,

32:22.040 --> 32:23.960
electrodes, radiations, nothing like that.

32:24.520 --> 32:28.600
We hijack the native bioelectrical interface

32:28.600 --> 32:31.000
that these cells are using to hack each other.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.840
So that is the ion channels

32:32.840 --> 32:35.160
and the gap junctions that they express.

32:35.160 --> 32:38.360
So we basically steal all the tools from neuroscience.

32:38.360 --> 32:42.760
So this is ion channel drugs and optogenetics

32:42.760 --> 32:45.080
and various manipulations of these channels

32:45.080 --> 32:48.280
that you can use to control the voltage pattern

32:48.280 --> 32:49.640
in this tissue.

32:49.640 --> 32:51.560
When you do that, several things happen.

32:51.560 --> 32:54.040
Initially, this work, for example,

32:54.040 --> 32:56.280
this eye story was published in 2010.

32:56.280 --> 32:58.280
Initially, when we said we wanted to change

32:58.280 --> 32:59.480
the resting potential of cells,

33:00.280 --> 33:02.200
the background assumption was going to be

33:02.200 --> 33:04.680
that what you'll get is uninterpretable toxicity

33:04.680 --> 33:06.680
and death because voltage was thought

33:06.680 --> 33:08.120
to be a housekeeping parameter.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.360
And I want to show you actually what it really does.

33:10.360 --> 33:12.760
So what we do here is we inject some,

33:12.760 --> 33:14.760
in this particular case, we inject some RNA

33:14.760 --> 33:17.480
encoding a set of potassium channels.

33:17.480 --> 33:19.320
What they can do with the cells they end up in,

33:19.320 --> 33:21.400
once the proteins are made, is set a voltage,

33:21.400 --> 33:24.920
a little pattern of voltage that looks like that eye spot

33:24.920 --> 33:26.760
that I just showed you in the electric phase.

33:26.760 --> 33:29.320
So when you do that, whichever cells get that pattern,

33:29.480 --> 33:31.640
they are instructed by that pattern to build an eye.

33:31.640 --> 33:34.440
And so here you have eye made from cells

33:34.440 --> 33:36.040
that were supposed to be gut.

33:36.040 --> 33:38.040
If you section those eyes, you get a lens,

33:38.040 --> 33:39.880
retina, optic nerve, all the right stuff.

33:39.880 --> 33:41.640
So here we learned some interesting things.

33:41.640 --> 33:44.440
First of all, that the bioelectric pattern is instructive.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.040
It actually calls up new eyes.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.960
It's not just that we messed it up

33:47.960 --> 33:50.200
and then the cells died and there's toxicity.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.320
No, it's actually instructive.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.400
You can call up healthy new organs

33:53.400 --> 33:55.560
by specific bioelectric patterns.

33:55.560 --> 33:56.600
It's modular.

33:56.600 --> 33:59.080
We didn't have to tell these cells how to build an eye.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.760
In fact, we have no idea how to build an eye.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.160
What we found is a high level subroutine,

34:03.160 --> 34:06.200
a basically a high level trigger

34:06.200 --> 34:08.120
that tells them to build an eye

34:08.120 --> 34:09.480
and they take care of the rest.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.040
It also, we also find that actually,

34:13.400 --> 34:16.280
there's this prompt of this bioelectric pattern

34:16.280 --> 34:18.120
reveals more competency in these cells

34:18.120 --> 34:21.160
because in the developmental biology textbook,

34:21.160 --> 34:24.360
it will tell you that only the anterior and erected room here

34:24.360 --> 34:26.120
is competent to make eye.

34:26.120 --> 34:28.520
And that's true if you prompt them with the Pac-6,

34:28.600 --> 34:30.920
so-called master regulator eye gene.

34:30.920 --> 34:33.320
But actually, these cells are perfectly competent.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.240
It's just that nobody had prompted them

34:35.240 --> 34:37.560
with a more convincing stimulus.

34:37.560 --> 34:39.800
And so this again reminds us to be humble

34:39.800 --> 34:41.800
in the sense that every assessment

34:41.800 --> 34:43.720
of the competency of some system

34:43.720 --> 34:46.040
is basically us taking an IQ test ourselves.

34:46.040 --> 34:48.280
It's what are we able to discover about that system

34:48.280 --> 34:50.040
and we need to be really cautious

34:50.040 --> 34:51.400
in putting limits on things

34:51.400 --> 34:52.840
when we haven't fully understood

34:52.840 --> 34:54.360
what the system is capable of.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.760
And finally, what I also really like about this

34:56.760 --> 34:59.080
is this amazing property of self-scaling.

34:59.080 --> 35:01.880
So this is a lens sitting out in the flank

35:01.880 --> 35:03.160
of a tadpole somewhere.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.240
The blue cells are the ones that we injected.

35:05.240 --> 35:06.600
But look, the rest of the lens

35:06.600 --> 35:09.480
is made of clear cells that we never touched directly.

35:09.480 --> 35:11.160
So what's happening here is that these cells

35:11.160 --> 35:13.080
got the message that they should build an eye,

35:13.080 --> 35:14.280
but there's not enough of them.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.800
And what they do is they recruit

35:15.800 --> 35:17.640
a bunch of their completely normal neighbors,

35:17.640 --> 35:20.760
so secondary instruction to help them in this task.

35:20.760 --> 35:21.960
And of course, we already know

35:21.960 --> 35:23.480
there are other collective intelligences

35:23.480 --> 35:24.920
that do this, for example, ants.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.280
So if a couple of ants find something

35:26.280 --> 35:27.320
that's too heavy for them to lift,

35:27.320 --> 35:30.280
what they'll do is recruit others to come and help.

35:30.280 --> 35:32.120
So collective intelligences tend to have

35:32.120 --> 35:34.760
this self-scaling property and the cells do it.

35:34.760 --> 35:37.560
We've deployed this idea of high-level triggers

35:37.560 --> 35:41.640
for very complex events for leg regeneration purposes.

35:41.640 --> 35:45.160
So frogs, unlike salamanders, do not regenerate their legs.

35:45.160 --> 35:48.040
And so if they lose a leg 45 days later, there's nothing.

35:48.040 --> 35:50.280
We came up with a cocktail,

35:50.280 --> 35:51.960
and this is Kelly Chang's work,

35:51.960 --> 35:55.800
where what she did was treat them for 24 hours.

35:55.800 --> 35:58.680
And it immediately induces a bunch of pro-regenerative genes.

35:58.680 --> 36:00.760
And then by 45 days, you get some toes,

36:00.760 --> 36:03.080
you get a toenail, eventually a pretty nice leg

36:03.080 --> 36:05.720
that is touch-sensitive and motile.

36:05.720 --> 36:09.320
Our latest paper shows one day of treatment

36:09.320 --> 36:11.320
followed by a year and a half of leg growth

36:11.320 --> 36:13.720
in the mature, fully adult frog.

36:13.720 --> 36:17.640
That's, again, this notion of an early decision-making intervention.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.720
We're not there to micromanage the stem cells

36:19.720 --> 36:21.320
or tell any of the cells where they should go

36:21.320 --> 36:22.920
or what the gene expression should be.

36:22.920 --> 36:24.520
We have no idea how to do that.

36:24.520 --> 36:26.280
And I don't think we will for a really long time,

36:26.280 --> 36:28.840
but what we can do is discover the prompts,

36:28.840 --> 36:32.120
the stimuli that get the system to undergo

36:32.120 --> 36:34.920
certain complex behaviors, morphogenetic behaviors.

36:34.920 --> 36:36.520
So here I should do a disclosure,

36:37.160 --> 36:39.320
because David Kaplan and I have this spin-off company

36:39.320 --> 36:40.760
called Morphosuticals.

36:40.760 --> 36:44.440
And what we are doing now is trying this technology in mammals,

36:44.440 --> 36:46.520
hopefully eventually towards human patients,

36:46.520 --> 36:48.680
but we're nowhere near human patients yet.

36:48.680 --> 36:51.720
The idea is to use a wearable bioreactor,

36:52.040 --> 36:56.120
an aqueous environment in which we control the bioelectric

36:56.120 --> 36:57.800
and other states of these cells

36:57.800 --> 37:01.800
and get them to commit early on to a leg-growing behavior

37:01.800 --> 37:03.800
versus a scarring behavior.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.760
Okay, the next quick story I'm going to tell you is about planaria.

37:07.320 --> 37:08.840
And so here are these flatworms.

37:08.840 --> 37:10.760
And perhaps one of the most interesting things

37:10.760 --> 37:13.080
about these flatworms is that they are immortal.

37:13.080 --> 37:16.680
So these theories of aging that say that aging is inevitable,

37:16.680 --> 37:19.880
that because it's a kind of accumulation of mistakes

37:19.960 --> 37:22.120
and entropic loss and so on,

37:22.120 --> 37:23.960
I think they cannot be corrected.

37:23.960 --> 37:26.600
The asexual strains of these animals do not age.

37:26.600 --> 37:29.160
Nobody's ever seen an old asexual planarian.

37:29.800 --> 37:32.840
They just continuously regenerate their bodies.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.360
And you might ask a question,

37:34.360 --> 37:36.520
if you amputate the head and the tail

37:36.520 --> 37:37.880
and you have this middle fragment,

37:37.880 --> 37:39.240
how does that middle fragment know

37:39.240 --> 37:41.160
how many heads it's supposed to have?

37:41.160 --> 37:43.960
Like right here, this piece is going to grow ahead

37:43.960 --> 37:46.360
and then the same, the near neighbor cells here

37:46.360 --> 37:47.640
are actually going to grow a tail.

37:47.640 --> 37:48.840
Why do they do different things?

37:48.840 --> 37:51.080
How does this thing know how many heads

37:51.080 --> 37:52.600
each fragment is supposed to have?

37:52.600 --> 37:54.440
And so we found an electric circuit

37:54.440 --> 37:56.760
which maintains a pattern like this

37:56.760 --> 37:58.120
that says one head, one tail.

37:58.120 --> 38:00.760
And if you cut this reliably, you get one headed worms.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.080
And if we rewrite that electrical information

38:03.080 --> 38:05.240
using ion channel drug exposure,

38:05.240 --> 38:07.080
just for the first few hours,

38:07.080 --> 38:08.920
what it'll do is set a voltage pattern

38:08.920 --> 38:10.760
that's like this and it holds.

38:10.760 --> 38:13.400
And then if you later cut this animal,

38:13.400 --> 38:16.520
this perfectly normal anatomically correct looking animal

38:16.520 --> 38:18.680
with normal gene expression, normal anatomy,

38:18.840 --> 38:20.920
will then regenerate us two heads

38:20.920 --> 38:23.800
because that is what its pattern memory says.

38:23.800 --> 38:26.040
So I promised you early on in the talk

38:26.040 --> 38:28.280
that we are going to find and rewrite

38:28.280 --> 38:31.320
the literal pattern memories that the tissue has

38:31.320 --> 38:32.920
about what it's supposed to build,

38:32.920 --> 38:33.880
what it's supposed to look like.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.400
This is it, you're looking at it.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.040
These are much scans you might do of a brain.

38:38.040 --> 38:40.760
This is the collective intelligence of these cells,

38:40.760 --> 38:42.760
maintains a memory, we can read that memory.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.240
And this is what this animal now thinks

38:45.240 --> 38:47.080
a proper plenarian should look like.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.800
It doesn't come into effect until it's injured

38:49.800 --> 38:52.200
and the cells are called upon to read that memory

38:52.200 --> 38:53.480
until then it's latent.

38:53.480 --> 38:55.960
So this is actually a counterfactual memory.

38:55.960 --> 38:57.480
The collective intelligence of cells

38:57.480 --> 38:59.320
is able to hold counterfactual memories.

38:59.320 --> 39:01.320
That's a pretty advanced style capacity actually.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.640
Why do I keep calling it a memory?

39:03.640 --> 39:06.680
Because if we take this two-headed animal

39:06.680 --> 39:08.120
and we cut off the primary head,

39:08.120 --> 39:10.200
we cut off this ectopic secondary head,

39:10.200 --> 39:11.880
you might think that it should go back to normal.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.600
After all, the genomic information is the same.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.920
We didn't touch the genome, there's no editing here.

39:17.160 --> 39:18.200
No trans genes.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.800
You might think that it should go back to normal,

39:19.800 --> 39:20.760
but in fact, it doesn't.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.440
These animals continue to generate

39:22.440 --> 39:24.520
two-headed animals in perpetuity.

39:24.520 --> 39:26.360
The first two-headed worms

39:26.360 --> 39:28.680
caused by it induced by a different mechanism

39:28.680 --> 39:31.320
were seen around 1903 by Thomas Hunt Morgan.

39:32.440 --> 39:34.600
Between that time and 2009,

39:34.600 --> 39:36.600
nobody had recut them to our knowledge

39:36.600 --> 39:38.120
because it seemed completely obvious

39:38.120 --> 39:38.760
of what would happen.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.120
The genetics are unchanged, of course,

39:40.120 --> 39:41.000
it'll go back to normal.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.120
Why would you recut them?

39:42.120 --> 39:44.280
And only this, and so the reason I mentioned this

39:44.280 --> 39:46.600
is because the conceptual part matters.

39:46.680 --> 39:49.560
It defines what experiments you are going to do,

39:49.560 --> 39:50.600
the way you think about this,

39:50.600 --> 39:53.320
and whether you think of genetics as specifying

39:53.320 --> 39:55.080
in a hardwired way what the outcome is

39:55.080 --> 39:57.800
versus as a kind of reprogrammable medium

39:57.800 --> 39:58.520
where you might say,

39:58.520 --> 40:00.280
I wonder if the memory has been reprogrammed

40:00.280 --> 40:01.560
and in fact, that's what happens here.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.880
So this has all the properties of memory,

40:03.880 --> 40:06.200
it's long-term stable, it's rewritable,

40:06.200 --> 40:08.360
it has conditional recall, which I just showed you,

40:08.360 --> 40:11.800
and here are these two-headed animals hanging out.

40:11.800 --> 40:14.440
Not only can you make animals with the wrong number of heads,

40:14.440 --> 40:16.520
but you can make this way animals with heads

40:16.520 --> 40:17.800
from other species.

40:17.800 --> 40:21.320
So this is a triangular-headed dugezia doradoscephala,

40:21.320 --> 40:24.120
you cut off the head, perturb the bioelectric circuit,

40:24.120 --> 40:26.920
and you can end up with flat heads like a Pifolina,

40:26.920 --> 40:29.480
you can end up with round heads like an S-Mediterrania,

40:29.480 --> 40:30.760
or of course, the normal heads.

40:31.400 --> 40:32.200
Not just the head shape,

40:32.200 --> 40:33.880
but the distribution of stem cells,

40:33.880 --> 40:37.720
the shape of the brain, and so these other species

40:37.720 --> 40:40.440
sit in these attractors in the state space,

40:40.440 --> 40:42.760
in the anatomical space, state space naturally,

40:43.400 --> 40:46.600
but you can convince this hardware to visit those regions.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.200
Without any genetic reprogramming,

40:48.200 --> 40:50.520
the exact same normal hardware can actually visit

40:50.520 --> 40:53.320
those other regions of anatomical state space.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.320
Now, you can go well beyond that,

40:55.320 --> 40:58.120
and we've made these kind of crazy, spiky shape things,

40:58.120 --> 41:00.920
these cylinders, this is not even a flat like a planarian,

41:00.920 --> 41:03.160
it's supposed to be combination forms.

41:03.160 --> 41:04.840
And so now we have to start thinking about

41:04.840 --> 41:07.400
what is the space of possibilities for these?

41:07.400 --> 41:08.440
In developmental biology,

41:08.440 --> 41:10.760
we hear a lot about developmental constraints,

41:10.760 --> 41:13.320
as if there were things that cells cannot build.

41:13.320 --> 41:16.360
We actually have no idea what cells can and cannot build.

41:16.360 --> 41:19.240
So let's just take a look at this simple fact

41:19.240 --> 41:21.560
that we are not the only bioengineers.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.720
So here's a cool plant example,

41:23.720 --> 41:25.480
I'm obsessed with these gauze lately,

41:25.480 --> 41:28.760
but this is what the acorn normally builds.

41:28.760 --> 41:30.200
Okay, so this is the oak leaf,

41:30.200 --> 41:32.200
and if all you look at is this,

41:32.200 --> 41:35.000
you will get the idea that this is incredibly reliable,

41:35.000 --> 41:38.360
and that what the oak genome does is specify this,

41:38.360 --> 41:39.640
this is what it can do.

41:39.640 --> 41:41.080
But along comes a parasite,

41:41.080 --> 41:43.320
this is a wasp of a particular type,

41:43.320 --> 41:45.560
and the wasp is an interesting bioengineer.

41:45.560 --> 41:47.560
What it has, the lineage of the wasp,

41:47.560 --> 41:48.520
not the individual wasps,

41:48.520 --> 41:50.760
but the evolutionary lineage has learned

41:51.480 --> 41:53.480
is how to prompt these cells,

41:53.480 --> 41:55.960
perfectly normal, not genetically edited cells,

41:55.960 --> 41:57.800
to build something completely different.

41:57.800 --> 42:00.360
This big round, bitey, red, and yellow thing

42:00.360 --> 42:01.800
is made of these cells,

42:01.800 --> 42:04.840
okay, because they were prompted by this bioengineer.

42:04.840 --> 42:06.520
Would we have any clue that these cells

42:06.520 --> 42:08.200
are capable of building something like this?

42:08.280 --> 42:09.960
We'd have no idea if we didn't already see

42:09.960 --> 42:11.160
that this was here.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.680
So we have to understand now

42:12.680 --> 42:16.920
that the reliability of hereditary is really deceiving,

42:16.920 --> 42:19.560
because it keeps us from realizing

42:19.560 --> 42:21.240
what the space of possibilities are,

42:21.960 --> 42:24.440
and that bioprompting in this way

42:24.440 --> 42:26.120
is actually really powerful,

42:26.120 --> 42:27.640
and can let you do things

42:27.640 --> 42:29.160
that micromanagement cannot let you do.

42:29.160 --> 42:30.360
So when our group were trying

42:30.360 --> 42:32.120
for this kind of full stack approach,

42:32.120 --> 42:33.880
where you start with a molecular biology

42:33.880 --> 42:36.360
that tells you which ion channels are present,

42:36.360 --> 42:38.520
and then bioelectric simulators

42:38.520 --> 42:40.760
to understand tissue level bioelectric patterns

42:40.760 --> 42:41.880
and where they come from,

42:41.880 --> 42:44.200
and then dynamic properties of these patterns,

42:44.200 --> 42:46.120
if we cut the animal, do they rescale,

42:46.120 --> 42:48.040
do they restore, do they have memory,

42:48.040 --> 42:49.560
do they have plasticity,

42:49.560 --> 42:52.920
and from there to basically algorithmic models

42:52.920 --> 42:55.480
of how large scale anatomical decisions

42:55.480 --> 42:57.000
are going to be made.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.160
And once you have some of those models in hand,

42:59.160 --> 43:01.560
you can do rational interventions.

43:01.560 --> 43:03.560
So this is a normal frog brain,

43:03.560 --> 43:05.480
forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain,

43:05.560 --> 43:07.560
and under a variety of teratogens,

43:07.560 --> 43:09.400
this can be messed up.

43:09.400 --> 43:10.520
So for example, from nicotine,

43:10.520 --> 43:11.880
you can see the difference here

43:11.880 --> 43:13.240
between this brain and this.

43:13.240 --> 43:14.440
And so we asked, okay,

43:14.440 --> 43:17.240
is there any hope that using this bioelectrical information,

43:17.240 --> 43:20.520
we can actually restore something as complex as this?

43:20.520 --> 43:21.800
You might think that what you'd have to do

43:21.800 --> 43:23.400
is tattoo every single cell

43:23.400 --> 43:24.680
with the appropriate information

43:24.680 --> 43:27.240
to get back into this very specific pattern.

43:27.240 --> 43:29.320
So we made a computational model.

43:29.320 --> 43:33.320
This is Alexis Pytaka and Baipav Pai in my group did this,

43:33.320 --> 43:35.160
and they made this model and they asked,

43:35.160 --> 43:37.160
okay, under a scenario like this,

43:37.160 --> 43:38.360
when things have gone wrong,

43:38.360 --> 43:40.280
what can we do to the bioelectrical gradient

43:40.280 --> 43:41.480
to get back to normal?

43:41.480 --> 43:43.240
And the model actually suggested

43:43.240 --> 43:44.680
one particular ion channel,

43:44.680 --> 43:46.360
which is called the HCN2,

43:46.360 --> 43:48.280
and that channel has some really interesting properties

43:48.280 --> 43:49.640
that I don't have time to get into here,

43:49.640 --> 43:51.400
but one of the things it does

43:51.400 --> 43:54.920
is restore sharp bioelectrical patterns,

43:54.920 --> 43:58.200
it restore borders between adjacent compartments.

43:58.200 --> 44:02.600
And what that does is able to repair even genetic defects.

44:02.600 --> 44:04.200
So here's a normal brain.

44:04.200 --> 44:05.480
Here's the brain of a tadpole

44:05.480 --> 44:07.400
with a dominant notch mutant.

44:07.400 --> 44:08.920
So you can see the forebrain is gone,

44:08.920 --> 44:11.000
the midbrain and hindbrain are a big bubble.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.440
And even on that background,

44:12.440 --> 44:16.280
if you also give it either HCN2 RNA

44:16.280 --> 44:18.520
or a couple of human-approved drugs

44:18.520 --> 44:20.520
that are HCN2 openers,

44:20.520 --> 44:23.080
these animals will end up with a normal brain structure,

44:23.080 --> 44:25.880
normal brain gene expression, and normal IQs.

44:25.880 --> 44:27.160
If you test them on learning rates,

44:27.160 --> 44:29.000
they're indistinguishable from controls.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.960
So I'm not arguing that we can always fix genetic errors,

44:31.960 --> 44:36.120
but in some cases, you can fix hardware defects in software.

44:36.120 --> 44:37.800
So an exposure of this animal

44:37.800 --> 44:40.440
with a really powerful notch mutation

44:40.440 --> 44:43.320
to a drug that was picked by a computational platform

44:43.320 --> 44:45.720
restores a complex organ.

44:45.720 --> 44:49.240
So the future, as we see, is a workflow like this

44:49.240 --> 44:52.440
where there's a bunch of information of health and disease.

44:52.440 --> 44:55.000
And these data, by the way, are not available.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.760
We're just gearing up now to let this kind of physiology

44:58.760 --> 45:01.240
catch up to the omics kind of a data sets

45:01.240 --> 45:03.240
that exist for protein and RNA.

45:03.240 --> 45:07.480
And then we can ask which kinds of ion flow states

45:07.480 --> 45:09.000
would restore the correct pattern.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.080
And then it becomes fairly straightforward

45:11.080 --> 45:12.440
to find drugs that will do that.

45:12.440 --> 45:13.480
And so you can play with this.

45:13.480 --> 45:15.960
The early version of that platform is here.

45:15.960 --> 45:18.120
Okay, so I'm just going to wrap up

45:18.120 --> 45:20.280
by saying a couple of big picture things.

45:21.080 --> 45:23.640
We know that both evolution and development

45:23.640 --> 45:26.280
have scaled what they've fundamentally done

45:26.280 --> 45:28.360
is scaled the size of goals.

45:28.440 --> 45:31.880
So these little tiny creatures, microbes, and single cells

45:31.880 --> 45:33.320
have little tiny goals.

45:33.320 --> 45:36.360
They're cognitive light cones or the size of the goals

45:36.360 --> 45:38.760
that they're able to produce and work towards

45:38.760 --> 45:40.760
are basically right around the size of themselves.

45:40.760 --> 45:42.280
They don't care what happens in the environment.

45:42.280 --> 45:45.880
They just care about the internal physiological states.

45:46.440 --> 45:48.360
But here, in this kind of system,

45:48.920 --> 45:51.560
their tiny little goals have been inflated

45:51.560 --> 45:53.960
towards a very grandiose construction project,

45:53.960 --> 45:55.080
making a whole limb.

45:55.080 --> 45:57.640
We know it's a goal because if you deviate them from that goal,

45:57.640 --> 45:58.920
they will work very hard.

45:58.920 --> 46:01.080
They will spend all kinds of energy to rebuild.

46:01.080 --> 46:03.080
And when they reach that goal, they stop.

46:03.080 --> 46:05.960
And so now, whereas here, there are tiny little goals

46:05.960 --> 46:08.280
and physiological and transcriptional state space,

46:08.280 --> 46:11.480
here you have much larger goals and anatomical state space.

46:11.480 --> 46:14.920
But that amazing set of mechanisms,

46:15.560 --> 46:17.720
which we can talk about if people have questions,

46:17.720 --> 46:20.840
the set of mechanisms that allow the scaling of goals

46:20.840 --> 46:22.520
has a failure mode.

46:22.520 --> 46:23.800
That failure mode is cancer.

46:23.800 --> 46:25.400
So this is glioblastoma.

46:25.480 --> 46:28.280
Individual cells can disconnect from the electrical network.

46:28.280 --> 46:31.160
And at that point, they roll back to be amoebas.

46:31.160 --> 46:32.760
They are not more selfish.

46:32.760 --> 46:35.480
It's just that their cells are smaller, quite literally.

46:35.480 --> 46:37.240
The self here is very large.

46:37.240 --> 46:39.000
This is the kind of goals that it can pursue.

46:39.000 --> 46:42.120
These are tiny little cells here looking out for themselves.

46:43.480 --> 46:47.320
So we have developed ways to not only detect this process early,

46:47.320 --> 46:50.280
so this is hopefully a diagnostic modality for the future,

46:50.280 --> 46:52.040
but also to suppress it.

46:52.040 --> 46:53.640
Because instead of killing these cells,

46:53.720 --> 46:55.800
so this is the same animal here.

46:55.800 --> 46:59.240
This tapo is injected with a nasty human oncogene,

46:59.240 --> 47:03.000
for example, a P53 mutation or a KRAS or something.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.640
And the oncoprotein is very strongly expressed.

47:05.640 --> 47:06.840
In fact, it's all over the place here.

47:06.840 --> 47:07.960
It's labeled it.

47:07.960 --> 47:09.240
But there is no tumor.

47:09.240 --> 47:11.560
And that's because we co-injected an ion channel

47:11.560 --> 47:14.600
that forces these cells to stay in electrical communication

47:14.600 --> 47:15.400
with their neighbors.

47:15.400 --> 47:16.120
That's it.

47:16.120 --> 47:18.200
We don't regulate any of the other processes.

47:18.200 --> 47:20.760
We just reconnect it to the large-scale network

47:20.760 --> 47:23.240
that remembers that you should be working on the skin

47:23.240 --> 47:26.360
and muscle and things like that and not making a tumor.

47:26.360 --> 47:30.200
That means that we can think about next-generation biomedicine

47:30.200 --> 47:34.360
from the perspective of the protocognitive capacity

47:34.360 --> 47:36.920
of the material that we are trying to repair.

47:36.920 --> 47:38.680
So not just micromanagement,

47:38.680 --> 47:41.880
but actually all the way through the scales of the system,

47:41.880 --> 47:44.600
perhaps guided by our computational platforms

47:44.600 --> 47:47.080
and various AI wrappers on top of that,

47:47.080 --> 47:50.920
we can ask, what is the most efficient interaction interface?

47:50.920 --> 47:53.720
And I think biology and evolution work so well

47:53.720 --> 47:55.960
precisely because they don't micromanage.

47:55.960 --> 47:59.400
Evolution makes problem-solving machines at multiple scales

47:59.400 --> 48:01.560
and it is hacking at every level.

48:01.560 --> 48:05.160
Every cell is trying to hack every other cell and tissues.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.800
And they're all trying to hack themselves, by the way,

48:07.800 --> 48:10.360
to get them to do adaptive things

48:10.360 --> 48:12.680
despite the various problems in the environment.

48:12.680 --> 48:14.840
And so that means that we can take advantage of this.

48:14.840 --> 48:17.320
All of this stuff, the ability to sense,

48:17.320 --> 48:19.880
to amplify signals, to generalize, to discriminate,

48:19.880 --> 48:22.280
learn, and ultimately solve problems.

48:22.280 --> 48:24.680
Instead of building them from scratch ourselves,

48:24.680 --> 48:26.440
as we now do with robotics,

48:26.440 --> 48:29.160
we can take advantage of a billion years

48:29.160 --> 48:32.600
of optimizing these kind of capacities.

48:32.600 --> 48:35.000
And so we can think, now let's think about something else.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.600
Not only is our target,

48:36.600 --> 48:38.360
so the patient or the bioengineer tissue,

48:38.360 --> 48:43.000
not only is our target somewhat up here in the spectrum,

48:43.000 --> 48:45.240
but actually our intervention could be too.

48:45.240 --> 48:46.280
Right now we use drugs.

48:46.280 --> 48:49.240
Drugs, for the most part, are extremely dumb.

48:49.240 --> 48:50.600
They are very simple machines.

48:50.600 --> 48:51.960
They only do the one thing they do.

48:51.960 --> 48:54.120
They bind whatever targets they're going to bind,

48:54.120 --> 48:55.160
and that's it.

48:55.160 --> 48:56.600
And that's very limiting.

48:56.600 --> 48:58.120
Some kind of smart intervention.

48:58.120 --> 49:00.520
And yes, it could be an implanted piece of engineering,

49:00.520 --> 49:02.440
like a smart insulin pump or something like that.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.760
But here's a different way to think about it.

49:04.760 --> 49:06.920
So let's take a look at this thing.

49:06.920 --> 49:08.280
So here it is running around.

49:08.280 --> 49:10.440
If I were to ask you what that was,

49:10.440 --> 49:12.120
you might say that this is,

49:12.120 --> 49:13.880
we got this from a pond somewhere,

49:13.880 --> 49:16.360
a primitive organism from the bottom of a lake.

49:16.360 --> 49:18.200
And if you were to sequence the genome,

49:18.200 --> 49:19.480
you would find out something pretty well.

49:19.480 --> 49:21.720
The genome is 100% homo sapiens.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.520
Okay, what you're looking at here

49:24.520 --> 49:26.440
is something we call an anthrobot.

49:26.440 --> 49:29.480
It's a new, it's the next version of arzenobots,

49:29.480 --> 49:33.080
which are biological, self-multile biological constructs

49:33.080 --> 49:33.800
made from frog cells.

49:33.800 --> 49:35.640
These are made from human patient cells.

49:35.640 --> 49:37.720
There is no genetic modification here.

49:37.720 --> 49:39.240
There are no weird nanomaterials.

49:39.240 --> 49:41.960
There is no trans genes, no circuits.

49:41.960 --> 49:44.600
So far, we can add all those things and we will as needed.

49:44.600 --> 49:47.880
But for now, we're really interested in the baseline

49:47.960 --> 49:49.320
competencies, the plasticity.

49:49.320 --> 49:50.520
And so there's a protocol

49:50.520 --> 49:53.240
that causes these little guys to develop up here.

49:53.240 --> 49:55.400
They start to, they're basically lung organoids,

49:55.400 --> 49:57.640
and then they, we get them to turn inside out.

49:57.640 --> 49:59.720
And then you see what they really do

49:59.720 --> 50:01.960
when your lung epithelium gets to reboot

50:01.960 --> 50:04.280
its multicellularity and have a new life.

50:04.280 --> 50:06.600
And so they become these highly multi-little creatures

50:06.600 --> 50:08.360
that have all kinds of capacities.

50:08.360 --> 50:10.280
Here's one navigating a scratch

50:10.280 --> 50:11.880
through a bunch of neural tissue.

50:11.880 --> 50:13.240
So all this gray stuff out here

50:13.240 --> 50:16.920
is IPSC-derived human neural tissue.

50:16.920 --> 50:19.160
It's a lawn and we made this scratch through it

50:19.160 --> 50:20.520
and you could see it moving.

50:20.520 --> 50:22.360
Now, it's moving through this.

50:22.360 --> 50:23.560
What might be the interactions

50:23.560 --> 50:25.960
between the amphibot and this tissue here?

50:25.960 --> 50:27.480
If you let a bunch of them settle down,

50:27.480 --> 50:29.480
we call this a super bot or a bridge bot,

50:30.280 --> 50:31.640
because there's a bunch of them together.

50:31.640 --> 50:32.680
If you let them settle down,

50:32.680 --> 50:34.680
what you find is that over about four days,

50:34.680 --> 50:36.520
what they do is they knit the two sides

50:36.520 --> 50:38.200
of the wound together.

50:38.200 --> 50:39.480
And this is what it looks like.

50:39.480 --> 50:40.920
Now, whoever would have thought

50:40.920 --> 50:43.160
that your tracheal cell sitting quietly

50:43.160 --> 50:46.840
in your lungs and in your trachea for decades,

50:47.160 --> 50:49.400
that given a new environment,

50:49.400 --> 50:52.840
they would be able to reboot their multi-cellularity

50:52.840 --> 50:55.160
in a way that not only lets them move around

50:55.160 --> 50:56.280
and do other interesting things,

50:56.280 --> 50:59.160
but actually exert healing capacity on your other cells.

50:59.160 --> 51:00.920
Your tracheal cells have the capacity

51:00.920 --> 51:02.840
to fix peripheral innervation.

51:02.840 --> 51:04.040
What else do they know how to do?

51:04.040 --> 51:04.840
We have no idea.

51:04.840 --> 51:06.360
This was the first thing we tried.

51:06.360 --> 51:08.040
This was not test number 78

51:08.040 --> 51:09.720
out of a thousand different things we tried.

51:09.720 --> 51:10.680
This was the first thing.

51:10.680 --> 51:11.560
So I'm going to assume

51:11.560 --> 51:13.080
that we're not just extremely lucky

51:13.080 --> 51:14.600
to find the one thing that they know how to do.

51:14.600 --> 51:16.600
There's actually a ton of capabilities here.

51:16.600 --> 51:17.800
And the other interesting thing

51:17.800 --> 51:19.800
is that as a kind of intervention,

51:19.800 --> 51:22.120
something that might someday be personalized,

51:22.120 --> 51:23.880
medicine bots made from your own cells

51:23.880 --> 51:24.840
to go into your own body,

51:24.840 --> 51:26.440
no immune suppression needed,

51:26.440 --> 51:29.240
to do repairs, to clean out your arteries,

51:29.240 --> 51:31.400
drop off the pro-regenerative molecules

51:31.400 --> 51:32.520
as a million applications.

51:33.240 --> 51:35.240
But the cool thing is that unlike,

51:35.240 --> 51:37.240
let's say, nanorobotics or something else

51:37.240 --> 51:38.760
where we build it directly,

51:38.760 --> 51:40.920
these guys are your own cells.

51:40.920 --> 51:43.000
They share all the priors with your body

51:43.000 --> 51:44.280
about what health and diseases,

51:44.280 --> 51:46.120
what inflammation is, what cancer is,

51:46.120 --> 51:46.920
and so on.

51:46.920 --> 51:47.720
And these are not things

51:47.720 --> 51:50.200
we have to build into them from scratch.

51:50.200 --> 51:51.640
So the last thing I want to say

51:51.640 --> 51:53.080
is that moving forward,

51:53.080 --> 51:55.160
the field of biomedical interventions,

51:55.160 --> 51:57.160
this is what's currently on the table.

51:57.160 --> 51:58.920
So these kind of bottom-up interventions

51:58.920 --> 52:00.840
of surgery and stem cells and all this stuff.

52:00.840 --> 52:03.880
But there's this whole other gigantic set

52:03.880 --> 52:05.400
of approaches coming,

52:05.400 --> 52:06.520
which are top-down,

52:06.520 --> 52:08.840
which has to do with not only behavior shaping.

52:08.840 --> 52:09.960
We haven't even talked about this,

52:09.960 --> 52:12.840
but we have some really interesting approaches

52:12.840 --> 52:14.520
to training cells and tissues.

52:15.160 --> 52:16.440
And these are agential implants,

52:16.440 --> 52:19.240
and then various kinds of morphosuticals

52:19.240 --> 52:21.880
that speak to the anatomical intelligence.

52:21.880 --> 52:23.480
And so these are just some examples

52:23.480 --> 52:24.760
of what's actually coming.

52:24.760 --> 52:25.480
So my guess is,

52:25.480 --> 52:26.840
oh, and you can see the details

52:26.840 --> 52:27.960
in these reviews.

52:27.960 --> 52:30.520
So my guess is that future medicine

52:30.520 --> 52:33.080
is going to look a lot more like psychiatry

52:33.080 --> 52:34.600
than it's going to look like chemistry.

52:34.600 --> 52:36.840
We are really talking about exploiting

52:36.840 --> 52:38.680
the tools and the insights of neuroscience,

52:38.680 --> 52:40.600
very deep insights of neuroscience

52:40.600 --> 52:41.400
beyond neurons

52:41.400 --> 52:44.040
to understand multi-scale intelligent systems.

52:44.040 --> 52:46.120
And I think the ability to hack this

52:46.120 --> 52:49.240
for transformative health applications is massive.

52:49.240 --> 52:50.840
I will just thank all of the people

52:50.840 --> 52:53.640
that are doing the work

52:53.640 --> 52:54.920
that I mentioned here today,

52:54.920 --> 52:57.000
the various postdocs and students.

52:57.000 --> 52:57.960
All the technical support

52:57.960 --> 52:59.640
are many amazing collaborators,

52:59.640 --> 53:01.880
our funders who support this stuff.

53:02.760 --> 53:03.640
Again, disclosures.

53:03.640 --> 53:05.560
There's three companies that fund

53:05.560 --> 53:06.840
some of this work here.

53:06.840 --> 53:08.200
And Jeremy Gay,

53:08.200 --> 53:09.640
who did a lot of the illustrations

53:09.640 --> 53:10.600
that I just showed you,

53:10.600 --> 53:12.840
and most of all, the animal model systems,

53:12.840 --> 53:15.320
because they really have the hardest job of all here.

53:15.320 --> 53:17.480
So I will stop here and answer questions.

53:17.480 --> 53:18.040
Thank you so much.

53:18.600 --> 53:20.920
That was another mindblower.

53:20.920 --> 53:22.040
Thank you so much.

53:22.040 --> 53:23.400
I know we're over time now,

53:23.400 --> 53:25.160
but it would be difficult

53:25.160 --> 53:26.920
to synthesize all of the questions from the chat.

53:26.920 --> 53:28.040
Honestly, I have no,

53:28.040 --> 53:29.640
I'm not even going to try to do this.

53:29.640 --> 53:31.160
But I think for this group in particular,

53:31.160 --> 53:32.840
perhaps what's most interesting

53:32.840 --> 53:34.040
is if you were thinking about

53:34.040 --> 53:35.800
what people in this group could do

53:35.800 --> 53:37.560
to either improve work

53:37.560 --> 53:39.880
on the more elliptaceutical notion

53:39.880 --> 53:40.600
of what you mentioned,

53:40.600 --> 53:42.760
or on the agenda implant notion

53:42.760 --> 53:43.480
of what you mentioned,

53:43.480 --> 53:44.680
like where do you think

53:44.680 --> 53:45.800
are currently open challenges

53:45.800 --> 53:47.160
where people like maybe come from

53:47.160 --> 53:49.560
more of a biology aging background

53:49.560 --> 53:50.600
can like most help,

53:50.600 --> 53:52.440
or like how could they most help draw

53:52.440 --> 53:55.400
these applications into the field?

53:55.400 --> 53:56.680
What's outstanding there?

53:56.680 --> 53:57.400
What's left to do?

53:57.960 --> 53:58.760
Yeah, what's left to do?

53:58.760 --> 53:59.640
There's a lot left to do,

53:59.640 --> 54:00.920
but let's just talk about

54:00.920 --> 54:02.360
the aging thing in particular.

54:02.360 --> 54:03.800
So the theory of aging

54:03.800 --> 54:05.960
that we have been playing with

54:05.960 --> 54:07.240
is this idea that

54:07.240 --> 54:10.120
if you think about anatomical homeostasis,

54:11.080 --> 54:13.560
the need to continuously work

54:13.560 --> 54:14.680
towards maintaining a shape,

54:14.680 --> 54:16.360
that doesn't stop in adulthood.

54:16.360 --> 54:17.560
Once you've built the body,

54:17.560 --> 54:19.880
cells are dying and being reborn all the time,

54:19.880 --> 54:20.520
it has to,

54:20.520 --> 54:21.480
you have to work pretty hard

54:21.480 --> 54:22.920
to stay in the same in one place.

54:22.920 --> 54:24.760
So that morphostasis

54:24.760 --> 54:26.280
is happening all the time.

54:26.280 --> 54:28.600
But that requires having information

54:28.600 --> 54:30.440
about what the body is supposed to look like.

54:30.440 --> 54:31.800
If you're going to resist the drift

54:31.800 --> 54:32.760
of noise and aging

54:32.760 --> 54:33.880
and then cancer and so on,

54:33.880 --> 54:34.840
it requires you to have

54:34.840 --> 54:37.000
a crisp memory of the target morphology.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.760
And could it be that during aging

54:38.760 --> 54:40.120
that what happens is that

54:40.120 --> 54:41.240
there's a degradation

54:41.240 --> 54:43.720
of the target of morphology pattern memory?

54:43.720 --> 54:45.400
Maybe the pattern memory gets fuzzy.

54:45.400 --> 54:47.000
And we know when in development,

54:47.000 --> 54:47.960
if we make it fuzzy,

54:47.960 --> 54:48.680
development goes to,

54:48.680 --> 54:50.040
how can you get birth defects

54:50.040 --> 54:51.640
in adulthood if it gets fuzzy?

54:51.640 --> 54:54.040
I think what that looks like is aging.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.400
And so our approach currently

54:55.400 --> 54:56.680
is to think about ways

54:56.680 --> 54:59.880
to basically to sharpen that pattern

54:59.880 --> 55:01.720
and to refine that information.

55:01.720 --> 55:04.360
And so this means really developing

55:04.360 --> 55:06.440
not only the conceptual tools around

55:06.520 --> 55:08.840
aging as a defect of geometry,

55:08.840 --> 55:10.280
not a fundamental bio count.

55:10.280 --> 55:11.880
And of course, it might be multiple things.

55:11.880 --> 55:13.800
I'm not saying this is the only useful model,

55:13.800 --> 55:15.000
but to really develop

55:15.000 --> 55:16.840
the conceptual apparatus around this

55:16.840 --> 55:19.320
and then to build new tools.

55:19.320 --> 55:20.120
So we need more,

55:20.760 --> 55:21.800
but we need better ways

55:21.800 --> 55:23.720
to do voltage imaging in vivo.

55:23.720 --> 55:25.560
So there's a lot of technology development there.

55:25.560 --> 55:27.720
We need all kinds of efforts

55:27.720 --> 55:30.440
for better ion channel drugs,

55:30.440 --> 55:32.120
better computational models.

55:32.120 --> 55:34.760
Physiomics is huge as a huge need.

55:34.760 --> 55:35.960
We simply do not know

55:36.680 --> 55:39.000
what all the correct voltage states are

55:39.000 --> 55:40.600
for health and disease in different organs

55:40.600 --> 55:41.560
at different ages.

55:41.560 --> 55:43.000
So acquiring that data set

55:43.000 --> 55:44.840
is something that we are going to do.

55:44.840 --> 55:46.120
It's very important.

55:46.120 --> 55:46.920
It hasn't been done

55:46.920 --> 55:49.480
because molecular biology and biochemistry,

55:49.480 --> 55:50.920
they can work with dead tissue.

55:50.920 --> 55:52.040
So you fractionate your cells,

55:52.040 --> 55:53.640
you get your protein, your RNA, whatever,

55:53.640 --> 55:54.440
and that's fine.

55:54.440 --> 55:55.800
You can make a list of what you have.

55:55.800 --> 55:57.320
Bioelectricity doesn't work that way.

55:57.880 --> 55:59.880
As soon as the cell is dead,

55:59.880 --> 56:00.600
this is gone.

56:00.600 --> 56:02.440
You cannot do this in non-living tissue.

56:02.440 --> 56:04.600
So all of this has to be in vivo

56:04.600 --> 56:05.960
and it's quite difficult.

56:05.960 --> 56:08.120
So those are just some of the challenges

56:08.120 --> 56:10.040
that we're facing now.

56:10.040 --> 56:10.440
All right.

56:10.440 --> 56:10.760
Thanks.

56:10.760 --> 56:11.160
I don't know.

56:11.160 --> 56:11.960
Do you have to hop off?

56:13.640 --> 56:14.520
I have till 2.15.

56:14.520 --> 56:15.880
So I have another 10 minutes.

56:15.880 --> 56:16.360
Okay.

56:16.360 --> 56:16.680
Okay.

56:16.680 --> 56:17.960
Then let me get with,

56:17.960 --> 56:18.600
I think Micah,

56:18.600 --> 56:20.120
your question was highly uploaded.

56:20.120 --> 56:22.200
If you want to unmute your thoughts

56:22.200 --> 56:23.640
on the long term,

56:23.640 --> 56:25.080
I can also otherwise ask it.

56:25.640 --> 56:25.960
Sure.

56:25.960 --> 56:26.920
So I think you answered it,

56:26.920 --> 56:28.040
but I was wondering if you can go

56:28.040 --> 56:29.320
into a little more detail on

56:30.200 --> 56:31.480
how do we get to a place

56:31.480 --> 56:35.480
where we can image a living human

56:35.480 --> 56:37.560
and read its bioelectrical state?

56:37.560 --> 56:38.520
Like right now people are doing this

56:38.520 --> 56:39.960
with brains and then they plug

56:39.960 --> 56:41.320
the output into an AI

56:41.320 --> 56:43.080
and the AI is now learning

56:43.080 --> 56:44.920
how to interpret what that means.

56:44.920 --> 56:46.360
Presumably we want to do the same thing

56:46.360 --> 56:48.600
with the bioelectric network of the whole body.

56:48.600 --> 56:50.360
What is the path to get there

56:50.360 --> 56:51.960
technologically or like

56:51.960 --> 56:53.080
what research needs to be done?

56:53.080 --> 56:55.000
Very similar to the question Ellison asked.

56:55.720 --> 56:55.960
Yeah.

56:55.960 --> 56:57.640
The straightforward path

56:57.640 --> 56:59.720
is going to be to develop.

56:59.720 --> 57:01.640
So right now we have voltage sensitive dyes

57:01.640 --> 57:03.560
that can give us the bioelectric state of cells

57:03.560 --> 57:04.200
you can see,

57:04.200 --> 57:06.120
but obviously the majority of the body

57:06.120 --> 57:07.480
ourselves you cannot see.

57:07.480 --> 57:11.800
So some kind of improved bioelectric re-imaging technology

57:11.800 --> 57:14.920
that can let us read the state of deep tissues

57:14.920 --> 57:17.800
and then of course the computational models

57:17.800 --> 57:19.720
to go from the understanding

57:19.720 --> 57:21.240
of the patterns of health and disease

57:21.240 --> 57:22.680
to how to turn the disease ones

57:22.680 --> 57:23.560
into the healthy ones.

57:23.560 --> 57:25.160
That's the straightforward way.

57:25.160 --> 57:27.960
I happen to think there's a shortcut

57:27.960 --> 57:29.320
and I think the shortcut

57:29.320 --> 57:31.320
is going to be around understanding

57:31.320 --> 57:33.800
the higher level information processing

57:34.360 --> 57:35.400
in these networks.

57:35.400 --> 57:37.240
In other words, I really don't think in the end

57:37.240 --> 57:38.520
we're going to be micromanaging

57:38.520 --> 57:39.560
the bioelectric state

57:39.560 --> 57:41.080
any more than I want to micromanage

57:41.080 --> 57:42.360
of the molecular state.

57:42.360 --> 57:44.840
I think it's going to be the equivalent

57:44.840 --> 57:47.400
of what we do in behavior science.

57:47.400 --> 57:48.680
If you have a rat

57:48.680 --> 57:50.680
and you want them to do a little circus trick,

57:50.680 --> 57:52.360
one way is to try to play the body

57:52.360 --> 57:54.120
like a puppet and control every neuron

57:54.120 --> 57:55.000
and try to get them to walk

57:55.000 --> 57:56.040
and do the various things,

57:56.040 --> 57:58.200
but the much easier way is to train the rat

57:58.200 --> 58:00.520
because the rat offers this amazing interface

58:00.520 --> 58:01.160
called learning,

58:01.160 --> 58:03.000
which enables you to give rewards and punishments

58:03.000 --> 58:04.120
and you don't have to know the details

58:04.120 --> 58:05.560
of which neurons are doing what.

58:05.560 --> 58:07.800
I think it's going to end up like this.

58:07.800 --> 58:09.000
I think we're going to,

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
once we figure out what actual

58:11.000 --> 58:12.520
protocognitive capacities

58:12.520 --> 58:13.960
these electrical networks have,

58:13.960 --> 58:15.160
we're going to develop a kind of

58:16.280 --> 58:17.640
systematic training protocols

58:17.640 --> 58:19.240
where you can give them stimuli

58:19.240 --> 58:20.680
and it's not going to be about

58:20.680 --> 58:22.200
knowing which cells have which voltage

58:22.200 --> 58:24.120
is going to be a much higher level intervention,

58:24.120 --> 58:25.800
but stay tuned about that.

58:25.800 --> 58:27.160
We're still working that out.

58:27.160 --> 58:29.080
We have Ben Moskowitz next.

58:29.080 --> 58:30.120
Hey, sorry.

58:31.160 --> 58:32.120
Sorry about that.

58:32.120 --> 58:33.720
I was wondering if,

58:33.720 --> 58:34.840
I guess like what we're just saying

58:34.840 --> 58:36.680
about like the brain dynamics of

58:37.720 --> 58:39.480
being able to read the state

58:39.480 --> 58:42.200
and then be more predictive from experimentation,

58:43.720 --> 58:44.920
like for the plan area

58:45.480 --> 58:48.440
to be able to modify their head generation

58:48.440 --> 58:49.560
to be able to say two heads,

58:49.560 --> 58:50.600
four heads, something like this

58:50.600 --> 58:51.400
and the construction,

58:52.680 --> 58:54.280
you need to be able to manipulate

58:54.280 --> 58:55.400
the electrical networks

58:56.120 --> 58:57.160
to guide the cells

58:57.160 --> 58:58.680
like towards that goal that you want.

58:59.240 --> 59:01.640
So do you have a systematic way

59:01.640 --> 59:03.640
to approach that problem currently?

59:04.680 --> 59:06.760
Or is it mostly through experimentation

59:06.760 --> 59:09.320
and like once we collect the larger data set,

59:09.320 --> 59:10.440
it'll be able to be much more

59:11.000 --> 59:12.680
like AI driven or something like that?

59:13.320 --> 59:14.840
Yeah, up until now,

59:14.840 --> 59:16.760
the only path that we've had

59:16.760 --> 59:19.320
is to observe natural patterns

59:19.320 --> 59:20.440
and try to infer.

59:20.440 --> 59:21.400
So if you want to know

59:21.400 --> 59:23.000
what bioelectric pattern kicks off,

59:23.000 --> 59:23.880
eye development,

59:23.880 --> 59:26.120
when you look early on in the embryo

59:26.120 --> 59:27.320
before the eye comes up and that,

59:27.320 --> 59:28.440
oh, wow, there's an eye spot

59:28.440 --> 59:29.960
and that's the pattern that kicks it off.

59:29.960 --> 59:31.080
You can do the same for limb.

59:31.080 --> 59:32.440
You can do the same for the brain.

59:32.440 --> 59:33.720
So we've now done it in,

59:33.720 --> 59:34.040
I don't know,

59:34.040 --> 59:35.800
half a dozen different contexts.

59:35.800 --> 59:37.720
It's extremely difficult

59:37.720 --> 59:39.080
and time consuming.

59:39.080 --> 59:40.760
And I am hoping

59:40.760 --> 59:42.840
and we're working on some of this

59:42.840 --> 59:45.960
to develop automated robot scientist platforms

59:45.960 --> 59:48.360
that together with improved bioelectric

59:49.640 --> 59:51.320
characterization machinery,

59:51.320 --> 59:52.120
better dyes,

59:52.120 --> 59:53.720
maybe CAT scan reagents

59:53.720 --> 59:55.560
and so on that are voltage sensitive.

59:55.560 --> 59:57.000
We can automate that process,

59:57.000 --> 59:58.040
make it high throughput

59:58.040 --> 59:59.640
and really then from there,

59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.760
use AI and maybe conventional analysis tools

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.280
to extract an understanding

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.240
of the bioelectric code.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.480
That's what we call is cracking the bioelectric code.

01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.200
For now,

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:10.440
our number of examples is quite low

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.600
and so all we can do is look at

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:13.400
normal embryos,

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.360
normal regeneration,

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.280
normal tumor genesis

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.720
and try to learn from that.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.680
But I think ultimately

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.280
we would like to scan the whole

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.000
many species,

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:21.960
many different ages,

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.400
many different disease conditions

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:24.120
and from that,

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.880
figure out what actually the encoding

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.240
is top to bottom.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:27.960
That's ambitious.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.080
Okay, Shruti, you next.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.800
Hi, it was an amazing talk.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.240
Thank you so much, Michael.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.160
I was wondering what else are we missing?

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.320
Bioelectricity is of course one aspect,

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:40.360
but also there must be other forces,

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:40.680
right,

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.920
electromagnetic dissonant light waves,

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:44.680
sound waves,

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.360
some weak UQ forces.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.800
I'm not able to sync all of them,

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:50.280
but like all of these exist in nature

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.760
and I'm sure they must exist in the body as well.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:56.440
Are there any labs that are working on this

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.720
or tools that are

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.760
resistant to even stark testing these things?

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.000
Yeah, yeah, that's a great question.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.320
And we think about this stuff all the time

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.640
and I encourage my students

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.080
and postdocs to ask,

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.280
what would we be missing?

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.240
Using the approaches

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:11.960
and more importantly,

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.960
the conceptual tools that we have,

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.800
what would they absolutely not see?

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:17.320
And so you got your known unknowns

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.280
and your unknown unknowns.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.040
So I can't say anything about the unknown unknowns,

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.080
but for the known unknowns,

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:21.960
there's a few things.

01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.520
So we know that we really don't understand yet

01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:27.080
the phenomenon of mitogenic radiation,

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.680
so ultra weak photon emission.

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.680
So there are some good labs that work on this.

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:32.920
Cells are exchanging light

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.080
and other kinds of electromagnetic radiation

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:35.560
with each other.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.320
We don't know what it does.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.680
We don't have good tools for it,

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.440
but I'm going to guess

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.040
that it's probably quite important.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.640
There may be sound,

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.040
vibratory kind of things that happen.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.760
The nuclear envelope has an electrical potential across it.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.520
We haven't even begun to scratch

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:52.280
what implications that might have

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.560
for gene expression.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.480
In fact, all the organelles have,

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.720
all the membrane bound organelles have voltages.

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.880
So yeah, biophysics is,

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.880
I'm sure has tons of surprises for us.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:03.720
In fact, we can go in the opposite direction

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.800
instead of looking down into these organelles,

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.760
like we found recently

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.680
that actually embryos talk to each other.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.480
So whole embryo,

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.240
so groups of embryos make a,

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.760
what I call a hyper embryo,

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.160
where the whole large collections of embryos

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.800
can solve problems that individual embryos cannot.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:20.440
And they have their own gene expression profiles

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.840
that small groups of embryos don't have and so on.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.160
So there are many surprises here.

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.680
And yeah, some of these are being studied

01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:27.800
and some we don't need to know about.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.520
Okay, maybe we have time for one more for you.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.040
Now, you had the idea in that phone on time,

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:32.920
if you want to go for it.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.080
Sure, yes.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:36.120
Thank you, Tricia.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.240
Talk as usual, Mike.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.040
Thank you.

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.760
Just, I'm trying to get my head around this.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.000
When you reconstitute an eye,

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.360
let's say in the plant area,

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.080
you're setting up some bioelectric pattern

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:50.360
and you said you're changing

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.920
the ion channel states of a few cells

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.840
and then they communicate to the other

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.200
surrounding cells, right?

01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.000
Something like that.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.160
I'm probably watching this up.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.120
So I'm just curious,

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:04.200
when you do that,

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:07.160
do you have to target specific cells

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:11.000
and how many cells do you actually manipulate

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.440
and then how many other cells

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.600
do they have to interact with?

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.880
Yeah, it's a great question.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.160
It depends on the scenario.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.040
So for example,

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.480
we have one scenario where

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.040
we can induce melanoma in these tadpoles

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.480
without any kind of genetic damage,

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.120
no oncogenes,

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.520
just by disrupting the electrical communication.

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.120
That takes about three cells.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.120
That only takes about three cells to do that.

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.000
In the case of the eye,

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.200
it's actually quite interesting

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.360
because when you establish these cells

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.240
that want to be eye,

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.560
all of their neighbors are telling them,

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.240
you're wrong, you should be skinned.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.080
And they have this debate back and forth

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:41.720
and we can see it.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:42.760
We can literally see it

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:43.960
because if you,

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.880
I had this experience right from the beginning,

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:46.680
I tried to,

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:49.000
I wanted to make the whole embryo one giant eye.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.200
Okay, so I just wanted to turn every cell into an eye.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.040
So I shot it up with a ton of this potassium channel RNA

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.320
and you look at the embryos

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:59.240
and I was using a transgenic

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.760
that is actually glows

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.680
where the master eye gene is turned on.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:03.560
So I look at this thing

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:05.240
and I see seven spots as I cool.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.840
This tadpole is going to have seven eyes.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.120
And then you look the next day

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.400
and it's, oh wait, it's only four.

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.760
And the next day, wait, it's only two.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.440
And the next day, you're lucky if you get one.

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:13.720
So what's happening is that

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:14.520
all the other cells,

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:15.480
this one cell is saying,

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:16.280
let's build an eye

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.080
and all the others are saying,

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.120
you're crazy, we're skinned.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.560
And depending on who wins,

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.000
they have this back and forth interaction

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:21.880
depending on who wins.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:23.400
And it's a cancer suppression mechanism.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.520
You don't want a lot of cells

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.200
with weird voltages around.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:26.840
So in that case,

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:28.040
it actually, there is a threshold.

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:29.240
I don't have an exact number for you,

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.160
but there is a threshold where

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:32.760
if you're not in that threshold,

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:34.920
the other cells are going to wipe out

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.280
what you're trying to do.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.240
Mike, thank you so much.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.520
I know we've kept you one minute over.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.480
I remind you of your time.

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.560
This was absolutely mind-boggling as usual.

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:43.640
I can't wait to have you back whenever you're ready.

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:43.960
Any time.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.400
Thanks everyone for your great questions.

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.760
This was absolutely fantastic.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:47.240
Thank you.

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.200
I see you for the next one.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:48.760
Thank you, Shanky.

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.320
Thank you.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:49.880
Thank you so much.

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.600
Thank you, everybody.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:50.840
Yeah.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.440
Anytime we can have an in-depth talk

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.800
about bot staging with everyone.

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:55.160
So thanks, everyone.
