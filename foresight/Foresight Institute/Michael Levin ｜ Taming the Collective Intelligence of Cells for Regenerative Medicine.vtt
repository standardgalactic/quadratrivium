00:00.000 --> 00:02.480
Welcome, everyone, to Forsyth's Biotech and Health Extension

00:02.480 --> 00:04.960
Group, sponsored by 100 Plus Capital.

00:04.960 --> 00:07.440
I'm so filled to have Michael Levine here today.

00:07.440 --> 00:10.160
He was recommended by someone whose recommendations

00:10.160 --> 00:11.200
I hold very highly.

00:11.200 --> 00:12.680
So I'm terribly excited for your talk.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.600
I think you're tying together a variety

00:14.600 --> 00:16.360
of different super interesting fields.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.240
You're definitely, I think, pushing the envelope

00:18.240 --> 00:20.200
with the research that you do.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.960
I will say no more and let you guys

00:22.960 --> 00:23.760
the conversation.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.600
We'll have a little break halfway through,

00:25.600 --> 00:27.240
in which we'll have a few announcements

00:27.240 --> 00:29.280
from people in the community, and then

00:29.280 --> 00:30.640
we'll go for a longer discussion.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.440
I think Michael already said he can stay a little longer.

00:33.440 --> 00:36.760
But this is just a reminder from me on the beginning

00:36.760 --> 00:39.280
that I will, in a second, prompt you in the chat

00:39.280 --> 00:40.880
to ask questions.

00:40.880 --> 00:43.920
And usually what happens at the end of these talks

00:43.920 --> 00:47.080
is that we have lots of questions and not the time

00:47.080 --> 00:48.120
to cover them all.

00:48.120 --> 00:48.960
So don't be shy.

00:48.960 --> 00:49.760
Ask them early.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.960
Then we can start uploading, downloading questions.

00:51.960 --> 00:54.120
Because usually at the end of it, we always

00:54.120 --> 00:56.280
try to keep them as short as possible.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.880
But why not start early with asking questions?

00:58.880 --> 01:01.280
So thank you so, so, so much for joining today.

01:01.280 --> 01:03.680
And Michael, it's really a pleasure to finally have you on.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.640
We scheduled this a while back already.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.840
And you're going to tell us lots of things

01:07.840 --> 01:10.200
about regenerative medicine that I think

01:10.200 --> 01:13.160
many people here don't even have on the radar yet at all.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.360
You're leading the Taft Center for Regenerative

01:15.360 --> 01:16.760
and Developmental Biology.

01:16.760 --> 01:18.920
I will post more on your bio in the chat.

01:18.920 --> 01:20.240
For now, please take it away.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.760
I'm really thrilled to have you here.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.600
And thank you for joining.

01:23.600 --> 01:24.640
Thank you so much.

01:24.640 --> 01:27.760
And yeah, thank you for having me and for the opportunity

01:27.760 --> 01:30.880
to speak to you all about this.

01:30.880 --> 01:34.280
So let's see, can everybody see my slide?

01:34.280 --> 01:34.960
Yeah, perfect.

01:34.960 --> 01:37.520
OK, so you see here two websites.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.800
Please feel free to get in touch with me afterwards

01:39.800 --> 01:41.680
if you have any questions that we don't cover.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.480
Everything is there, all the primary papers

01:43.480 --> 01:45.160
and everything else is there.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.840
And I have to do a disclosure.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.120
I have a spin-off company called Morphosuticals Inc.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.000
with David Kaplan.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.880
And I'll tell you a little bit more about that.

01:53.920 --> 01:59.160
So I want to give the main point of the talk right up front.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.800
And here are the four things that I'm

02:00.800 --> 02:02.680
going to try to transmit today.

02:02.680 --> 02:06.600
I think that solving the problem of anatomical homeostasis,

02:06.600 --> 02:10.000
which I will discuss, is the key to really transformative

02:10.000 --> 02:12.120
regenerative medicine, which will address aging

02:12.120 --> 02:14.320
as well as many other things.

02:14.320 --> 02:17.520
And that the current approaches focusing

02:17.520 --> 02:20.400
on stem cell biology, genomic editing, things like this

02:20.400 --> 02:22.520
are limited by themselves.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.640
And that what is really, really key

02:24.640 --> 02:27.040
is to understand the software of life.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.960
And I'll show you some examples of that.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.640
A key medium by which cells compute and make decisions

02:32.640 --> 02:36.440
in vivo is what we call non-neural bioelectricity.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.560
And it now turns out that we have learned to read and write

02:39.560 --> 02:42.520
various goal states into the collective intelligence

02:42.520 --> 02:43.200
of tissues.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.920
And I'll show you some examples of that.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.680
And I think fundamentally that cracking

02:46.680 --> 02:50.400
this bioelectric code, which is a sort of evolutionary precursor

02:50.400 --> 02:53.040
to the electric code that our brains use,

02:53.040 --> 02:56.360
will enable a really profound new class of electroseuticals

02:56.360 --> 02:59.000
with lots of new applications in birth defects,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.320
regenerative medicine, cancer, aging,

03:01.320 --> 03:02.880
and synthetic bioengineering.

03:02.880 --> 03:04.440
So those are my main points.

03:04.440 --> 03:07.120
If we boil down the whole talk to one sentence,

03:07.120 --> 03:10.000
what I'm here to tell you is that, like the brain,

03:10.000 --> 03:12.640
all of your body cells and tissues make decisions.

03:12.640 --> 03:15.720
And these are decisions about structure and function.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.760
And that we can now, we have the techniques

03:17.800 --> 03:21.560
to actually read the information processing that

03:21.560 --> 03:24.800
goes into those decisions and actually modify it rationally.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.560
And what you see here is one of our five-legged frogs.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.080
And this is my reminder to tell you

03:29.080 --> 03:31.160
that you're going to see all kinds of weird-looking creatures

03:31.160 --> 03:31.560
today.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.880
And that is not Photoshop.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.040
These are actual real animals that we produce as a means

03:36.040 --> 03:39.400
of testing our theories of where shape comes from

03:39.400 --> 03:41.720
and how to control.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.760
So let's talk first about some fundamental knowledge gaps.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.000
I want to highlight what it is that we don't know,

03:47.040 --> 03:52.400
despite all of our amazing advances in molecular biology.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.760
So what we would like to have is something

03:54.760 --> 03:57.480
we call the anatomical compiler.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.280
The idea is that someday you should

03:59.280 --> 04:01.080
be able to sit down at a computer

04:01.080 --> 04:04.440
and draw the animal or plant that you would like to have.

04:04.440 --> 04:09.920
So not try to create a bottom up from a description of pathways.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.640
You shouldn't need to think about pathways.

04:11.640 --> 04:14.960
You should be able to, like we do for computer-aided design,

04:14.960 --> 04:16.240
when the field is mature, you should

04:16.240 --> 04:19.480
be able to sit down and say, I want a three-headed flatworm

04:19.480 --> 04:21.400
with a shape that roughly looks like this.

04:21.400 --> 04:24.600
And what the compiler would do is convert that anatomical

04:24.600 --> 04:27.280
description into the set of stimuli

04:27.280 --> 04:29.720
that have to be given to those cells to produce whatever

04:29.720 --> 04:31.120
it is that you ask for.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.920
That's the end game for this field.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.200
It's complete and total control of morphology.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.240
And it might be a liver, and it might be a heart,

04:37.240 --> 04:39.320
and it might be a whole organism,

04:39.320 --> 04:42.040
or it might be something that's never existed on Earth before.

04:42.040 --> 04:43.000
It shouldn't matter.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.840
We should be able to take a description of the anatomy

04:46.840 --> 04:51.560
that we want and to figure out what stimuli would

04:51.560 --> 04:54.040
have to be given to cells to be able to produce it.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.560
And the critical thing is that if we could do this,

04:56.560 --> 05:00.200
we would immediately have all the answers to birth defects,

05:00.200 --> 05:03.040
to regenerating lost or damaged organs,

05:03.040 --> 05:06.040
to the defection from the body plan known as cancer,

05:06.040 --> 05:08.840
to aging, to all of these challenges

05:08.840 --> 05:11.760
to the normal healthy morphology of a body.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.960
And so this is fundamentally a problem of information

05:13.960 --> 05:16.040
processing, as I will argue.

05:16.040 --> 05:19.160
And so the question is, why don't we have this yet?

05:19.160 --> 05:21.640
Genomics has proceeded very rapidly.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.760
Why do we not have this?

05:22.760 --> 05:25.280
Because, of course, we don't have anything remotely like this.

05:25.280 --> 05:29.280
Our control over anatomy is still extremely poor.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.840
And so the reason is because there

05:31.840 --> 05:34.880
are fundamental gaps in our understanding.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.880
And I'll just give you a very simple example.

05:36.880 --> 05:39.200
So here on the left, you see an axolotl.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.960
And axolotl larvae have legs.

05:41.960 --> 05:43.680
And on the right, you see a frog larva.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.240
And frog larvae do not have legs.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.760
The tadpoles don't have legs.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.440
And one can do a thought experiment

05:48.440 --> 05:50.960
and say that, well, at the early embryonic stage,

05:50.960 --> 05:53.120
I'm going to take 50% of the axolotl embryo,

05:53.120 --> 05:55.480
50% of the frog embryo, I'm going to mix them up,

05:55.480 --> 05:57.120
and I'm going to make a frog allotl.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.120
And it turns out the cells do perfectly fine.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.560
They actually do work together.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.480
But now I ask you a simple question.

06:03.480 --> 06:05.640
Will the frog allotl have legs?

06:05.640 --> 06:07.040
You have access to both genomes.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.600
You have access to the axolotl genome.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.280
You have access to the frog genome.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.840
Will the frog allotl have legs?

06:11.840 --> 06:14.880
And if so, will the legs be made entirely of axolotl cells?

06:14.880 --> 06:16.480
Or will they recruit the frog cells?

06:16.480 --> 06:17.920
The point is we have no idea.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.800
And until we do the experiment, of course, right?

06:20.800 --> 06:23.080
So even having the genomic sequence,

06:23.080 --> 06:25.160
these basic fundamental questions

06:25.160 --> 06:27.080
about what shape is going to result

06:27.080 --> 06:28.640
are something that we cannot yet answer.

06:28.640 --> 06:31.560
And that really holds back regenerative medicine.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.840
And so let's just ask the fundamental question,

06:33.840 --> 06:35.360
where does shape come from?

06:35.360 --> 06:39.200
And so we all start life as this sort of ball

06:39.200 --> 06:40.560
of embryonic blastomers.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.920
And then here you see a cross-section

06:42.920 --> 06:44.160
through the human torso.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.600
So look at this incredible arrangement.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.120
All the organs are in exactly the right place,

06:49.120 --> 06:52.040
orientation, size, position relative to each other.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.560
Where does all this come from?

06:53.560 --> 06:57.240
And if you might be tempted to say the genome,

06:57.240 --> 06:59.560
and so the genome certainly produces

06:59.560 --> 07:01.920
the cellular hardware that you need to create this.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.400
So the genome gives you all the protein sequences,

07:04.400 --> 07:06.280
but the genome doesn't directly say anything

07:06.280 --> 07:07.720
about this kind of order.

07:07.720 --> 07:12.240
It's simply not there in that way.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.160
And so we really need to understand

07:14.160 --> 07:18.280
how do cell groups know what to make and when to stop, right?

07:18.280 --> 07:22.600
It's a collective, it's a collective intelligence problem

07:22.600 --> 07:25.440
in the sense that all of these cells are active agents

07:25.440 --> 07:26.920
that do various things.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.400
And the result of their activity

07:28.400 --> 07:31.200
is to self-assemble this amazing organism.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.320
And as part of understanding this process,

07:33.320 --> 07:35.920
we need to ask, first of all, in regenerative medicine,

07:35.920 --> 07:36.960
if part of this is missing,

07:36.960 --> 07:39.440
how do we convince the cells to rebuild it again?

07:39.440 --> 07:41.800
And as engineers, we might ask, well, what else could we build?

07:41.800 --> 07:43.280
Could we build something completely different

07:43.280 --> 07:44.800
out of these same cells?

07:44.800 --> 07:46.560
And so this central question

07:46.560 --> 07:49.640
of where anatomical order comes from

07:49.640 --> 07:51.840
and how do we control it is the key, I think,

07:51.840 --> 07:56.400
to really profound changes in how we do medicine.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.680
So the important thing is that single cells

07:59.680 --> 08:01.120
are incredibly competent.

08:01.120 --> 08:04.760
So here you have this creature is called the lacrimaria.

08:04.760 --> 08:08.440
And you can see what it's doing, it's hunting,

08:08.440 --> 08:12.000
it handles all of its physiological, its anatomical,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.400
and its behavioral needs all in one cell.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.400
There is no brain, there's no nervous system,

08:16.400 --> 08:17.360
there are no stem cells,

08:17.360 --> 08:19.800
there's no cell-to-cell communication, it's one cell.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.600
And it's doing everything it needs

08:21.600 --> 08:23.560
on the scale of one cell.

08:23.560 --> 08:26.480
Now, when cells get together,

08:26.480 --> 08:30.480
they actually scale up this ability

08:30.480 --> 08:32.280
and they work on much bigger goals.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.520
And these goals are the production

08:34.520 --> 08:38.560
of complex invariant anatomy, such as these here.

08:38.560 --> 08:43.560
And we know that simply differentiating stem cells

08:43.640 --> 08:46.400
into particular tissue types is not sufficient

08:46.400 --> 08:48.440
because then you can get something like this down here,

08:48.440 --> 08:49.760
which is a teratoma.

08:49.760 --> 08:52.680
So this is a tumor that might have skin and hair

08:52.680 --> 08:54.920
and teeth and bone and muscle.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.120
And the reason this is not a good embryo

08:57.960 --> 09:01.440
is because it's missing that three-dimensional organization,

09:01.440 --> 09:02.280
that structure.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.600
All the stem cell differentiation proceeded fine.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.600
You've got your cell types,

09:06.600 --> 09:08.520
you've got your mature derivatives,

09:08.520 --> 09:10.920
but they're not arranged in the correct place.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.640
So it's not enough to have the building blocks,

09:12.640 --> 09:15.880
you actually need to specify how they get together.

09:15.880 --> 09:19.860
And so there's a kind of a mainstream paradigm

09:19.860 --> 09:22.880
which thinks about a feed-forward emergent process

09:22.880 --> 09:24.400
where you have gene regulatory networks

09:24.400 --> 09:26.320
and these genes turn each other on and off,

09:26.320 --> 09:28.080
they make proteins, some of these proteins

09:28.080 --> 09:30.360
that are sticky or they exert force or they diffuse

09:30.360 --> 09:31.200
and so on.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.880
And as a result, there's this process

09:32.880 --> 09:34.480
of what they call emergence.

09:34.480 --> 09:37.560
And at the end, something really complex from top.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.680
And the difficulty with this paradigm

09:39.680 --> 09:41.600
for regenerative medicine is that

09:41.600 --> 09:43.200
if you want to make changes here,

09:43.200 --> 09:45.560
if you want to make repairs to the anatomy,

09:45.560 --> 09:49.920
you have to somehow invert this chain

09:49.920 --> 09:51.840
to figure out what are you going to do back here?

09:51.840 --> 09:53.240
Which genes are you going to edit

09:53.280 --> 09:56.520
and how in order to make complex anatomical changes?

09:56.520 --> 10:00.160
And that inverse problem is fundamentally intractable.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.600
It's extremely difficult.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.520
And so this is basically what's holding

10:04.520 --> 10:05.440
back regenerative medicine.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.640
You simply don't know how to figure out

10:07.640 --> 10:10.520
what changes to make at the very lowest levels

10:10.520 --> 10:14.520
to give you the desired effects at the system level.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.560
And so what we're very good at in the field

10:16.560 --> 10:18.040
is figuring out things like this,

10:18.040 --> 10:20.600
which genes and proteins control each other

10:20.600 --> 10:21.920
and so on these pathways.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.000
But what we really want to understand is this,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.280
where do these different shapes come from

10:26.280 --> 10:28.760
and what do we do when we want to alter

10:28.760 --> 10:31.480
the rationally, okay.

10:31.480 --> 10:35.600
So I should point out that it's not only

10:35.600 --> 10:40.120
about creating a complex body during embryogenesis,

10:40.120 --> 10:42.520
it's also about the amazing ability

10:42.520 --> 10:45.600
of the cellular collectives to repair over time.

10:45.600 --> 10:49.560
So here what you see here is an animal called an axolotl.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.560
So this is a Mexican salamander.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.440
These animals throughout their lifespan

10:53.440 --> 10:55.720
regenerate their eyes, their limbs,

10:55.720 --> 10:59.000
their ovaries, portions of their heart and brain

10:59.000 --> 11:00.240
and their spinal cords.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.600
So they will sort of bite off each other's legs

11:02.600 --> 11:05.120
all the time and if you keep them in an aquarium

11:05.120 --> 11:06.320
and the legs grow back.

11:06.320 --> 11:10.000
And so here's what happens no matter where you amputate

11:10.000 --> 11:11.960
or where they lose it along this axis,

11:11.960 --> 11:15.080
they will do exactly the correct amount of growth

11:15.080 --> 11:17.720
and patterning and then you have an indistinguishable limb

11:17.720 --> 11:18.600
at the end.

11:18.600 --> 11:22.000
And so what's remarkable about this

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
is not only that it rapidly grows

11:27.480 --> 11:29.760
and creates the correct tissues

11:29.760 --> 11:32.440
that actually stops at the right time.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.760
The fact that regeneration stops is really amazing.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.400
Think about it, when does it stop?

11:36.400 --> 11:39.400
It stops when a correct salamander limb has formed.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.040
And until then it has really rapid proliferation

11:42.040 --> 11:45.000
and cell movement and changes in gene expression.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.720
But all of that grinds to a halt

11:46.720 --> 11:49.520
when a correct salamander limb has formed.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.560
How does it know what a correct salamander limb is?

11:51.560 --> 11:52.760
How does it know when to stop?

11:52.760 --> 11:54.600
Because this is not simply a process

11:54.600 --> 11:56.120
that always starts at the egg,

11:56.120 --> 12:00.400
proceeds during a set of hardwired steps and then stops.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.040
This is a flexible process that you can interrupt,

12:03.040 --> 12:05.520
you can make changes, you can cut at any point

12:05.520 --> 12:07.480
and it will pick up exactly at the right spot,

12:07.480 --> 12:09.600
do what's needed and then stop when it's done.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.000
So there's a degree of plasticity

12:12.000 --> 12:15.060
and adaptive problem solving here.

12:15.060 --> 12:19.540
So of course, axolotls are not the only creatures

12:19.540 --> 12:21.940
that regenerate, so the human liver is regenerative

12:21.940 --> 12:23.540
and even the ancient Greeks knew that,

12:23.540 --> 12:25.140
I don't know how they knew that, but they did.

12:25.140 --> 12:29.860
As you see here, deer are a large adult mammal

12:29.860 --> 12:33.460
that every year regenerates huge amounts of bone

12:33.460 --> 12:36.060
and skin and innervation and vasculature.

12:36.060 --> 12:38.980
These antlers grow up to a rate of a centimeter

12:38.980 --> 12:40.260
and a half per day.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.300
Think about that, a centimeter and a half of new bone

12:42.300 --> 12:44.860
per day is possible in mammals.

12:44.860 --> 12:48.060
And even human children, usually below the age

12:48.060 --> 12:49.780
of somewhere between seven and 11,

12:49.780 --> 12:52.420
if they amputate their fingertips,

12:52.420 --> 12:53.860
if you don't sew it over with skin,

12:53.860 --> 12:55.900
but just sort of keep it clean, they will regenerate.

12:55.900 --> 12:59.020
So even human children initially have some regenerability

12:59.020 --> 13:03.260
to regenerate their fingers and then it goes away.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.340
So these here are, I think, the champions of regeneration

13:08.340 --> 13:12.820
and this should be a really motivational

13:12.820 --> 13:15.020
and sort of aspirational animal for us all

13:15.020 --> 13:17.540
who are interested in healthy lifespans.

13:17.540 --> 13:18.860
This is a planarian.

13:18.860 --> 13:21.180
These animals have a couple of interesting properties.

13:21.180 --> 13:22.660
First of all, they're a complex animal

13:22.660 --> 13:24.980
with a true brain and bilateral symmetry.

13:24.980 --> 13:26.020
They're not like earthworms.

13:26.020 --> 13:29.940
These are similar to our direct ancestor, okay?

13:29.940 --> 13:32.700
They, first of all, have the ability of regeneration.

13:32.700 --> 13:37.340
So you can cut them into any pieces along any plane.

13:37.340 --> 13:40.500
The record is something like 276 pieces.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.140
Every piece will regenerate exactly what's missing,

13:43.140 --> 13:43.980
no more, no less,

13:43.980 --> 13:45.900
and give you a perfect tiny little worm.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.460
Every piece, they regenerate their brain,

13:47.460 --> 13:48.740
every other organ.

13:48.740 --> 13:51.540
Not only that, they're smart, so they can learn.

13:51.540 --> 13:52.660
They have the ability to learn

13:52.660 --> 13:54.820
in a variety of behavioral assays.

13:54.820 --> 13:56.820
And best of all, they are immortal.

13:56.820 --> 13:59.380
There is no such thing as an old planarian.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.620
So individual cells senesce and fall off

14:02.620 --> 14:04.380
and they regenerate whatever's missing

14:04.380 --> 14:06.020
and they just keep on going.

14:06.020 --> 14:07.900
And so what these guys are telling us

14:07.900 --> 14:11.460
is that it is possible to be an immortal,

14:11.460 --> 14:15.060
highly regenerative creature that also has intelligence.

14:15.060 --> 14:18.100
This is not only for CNM and these and things like this.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.700
You can actually be a bilaterian with a true brain,

14:20.700 --> 14:23.300
all the same neurotransmitters that we have,

14:23.300 --> 14:24.940
and be immortal, okay?

14:24.940 --> 14:28.140
So this is a proof of principle right here,

14:28.140 --> 14:29.660
an existence proof.

14:29.660 --> 14:33.380
So one of the really important concepts

14:33.380 --> 14:35.500
to try and understand how all this works

14:35.500 --> 14:40.100
is really the idea of problem solving

14:40.100 --> 14:42.020
by the collective intelligence of cells.

14:42.020 --> 14:43.420
And I wanna show you just one example,

14:43.420 --> 14:45.700
there are many examples, I wanna show you one example.

14:45.700 --> 14:48.660
Here is a tadpole face and here's some eyes

14:48.660 --> 14:50.260
and the brain and the nostrils.

14:50.260 --> 14:52.020
And tadpoles need to become frogs.

14:52.020 --> 14:55.060
And in order to become frogs, they rearrange their face.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.460
So the nostrils have to move, the eyes have to move forward,

14:57.460 --> 14:59.860
the jaws have to move, all these things have to move around.

14:59.860 --> 15:01.700
And it used to be thought that somehow

15:01.700 --> 15:04.420
what the genetics does is it gives you

15:04.420 --> 15:06.700
a hardwired set of movements.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.180
After all, all tadpoles look the same

15:08.180 --> 15:09.100
and all frogs look the same.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.860
So as long as everything moves in the right way,

15:11.860 --> 15:14.300
you should get from a normal tadpole to a normal frog.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.860
So what we did was we made so-called Picasso tadpoles

15:16.860 --> 15:18.580
where everything is in the wrong place.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.740
So the eyes are off kilter,

15:20.740 --> 15:22.420
the nose is not where it's supposed to be,

15:22.420 --> 15:23.700
the jaws are on the side of the head,

15:23.700 --> 15:26.420
everything's not where it's supposed to be.

15:26.420 --> 15:30.340
So when this happens, what we find is that

15:30.340 --> 15:32.980
they still make largely normal frogs.

15:32.980 --> 15:33.820
Why?

15:33.820 --> 15:35.460
Because all of the different components

15:35.460 --> 15:38.580
move around in novel paths, okay?

15:38.580 --> 15:40.420
And in fact, sometimes they go too far

15:40.420 --> 15:41.860
and have to back up and come back,

15:41.860 --> 15:43.380
but they all move around

15:43.380 --> 15:46.140
until they get pretty much to a normal frog face.

15:46.140 --> 15:47.060
And this is remarkable.

15:47.060 --> 15:50.060
This means that what the genetics actually gives you

15:50.060 --> 15:53.340
is a machine that is able to minimize error,

15:53.340 --> 15:55.580
that it has some internal representation

15:55.580 --> 15:58.060
of what a correct frog face looks like.

15:58.100 --> 16:01.260
And when you start it off in the wrong configuration,

16:01.260 --> 16:05.420
something that never appears during normal embryogenesis,

16:05.420 --> 16:07.820
no problem, they can still navigate morphospace,

16:07.820 --> 16:10.900
they can navigate a path to where they need to be

16:10.900 --> 16:14.060
from this completely unexpected starting position.

16:14.060 --> 16:17.460
So this, if we had a swarm robotics instance

16:17.460 --> 16:19.060
that was able to do this, instead of cells,

16:19.060 --> 16:20.900
we have little robots that could do this,

16:20.900 --> 16:25.180
this would be a remarkable example

16:25.180 --> 16:26.180
of collective intelligence.

16:26.180 --> 16:27.500
And so it is here.

16:27.500 --> 16:31.620
These are groups of cells that are able to solve this problem

16:31.620 --> 16:34.420
from different starting configurations.

16:34.420 --> 16:37.340
And this is the process that collective intelligence

16:37.340 --> 16:40.020
and that problem solving is what we need to solve

16:40.020 --> 16:42.700
in addition to all of the mechanistic advances

16:42.700 --> 16:45.020
over the component pathways

16:45.020 --> 16:48.360
in order to really control anatomy

16:48.360 --> 16:50.940
and to really solve regenerative medicine.

16:50.940 --> 16:55.180
So what we would like to do is to try to move

16:55.180 --> 16:56.940
to a point where we really understand this

16:56.940 --> 16:58.540
at an algorithmic level,

16:58.540 --> 17:01.780
not just the mechanisms that are required for this to happen,

17:01.780 --> 17:05.300
but the algorithms that are sufficient for this to happen.

17:05.300 --> 17:06.980
And we really need to understand

17:06.980 --> 17:09.860
how these cellular collectives process information

17:09.860 --> 17:12.420
and how reprogrammable really is it.

17:12.420 --> 17:17.420
So computer science offers us an interesting analogy.

17:18.580 --> 17:22.140
Back in the 1940s and 50s, this is what programming looked

17:22.140 --> 17:22.980
like.

17:22.980 --> 17:23.820
So in order to program this computer,

17:23.820 --> 17:25.900
you have to physically move the wires around.

17:25.900 --> 17:29.700
You have to physically change the structure of the machine.

17:29.700 --> 17:33.620
And since then, the journey that computer science has taken

17:33.620 --> 17:36.180
is to realize that if your hardware is good enough,

17:36.180 --> 17:37.740
if it's reprogrammable,

17:37.740 --> 17:40.240
then you don't need to physically change the hardware.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.860
What you can do is interact with it

17:41.860 --> 17:44.260
by means of inputs or experiences

17:44.260 --> 17:46.620
and take advantage of the software that's in the system

17:46.620 --> 17:48.820
and the plasticity that's in the system.

17:48.820 --> 17:51.060
So of course, what you'll notice

17:51.060 --> 17:53.620
that all of modern biology is basically down here

17:53.620 --> 17:54.460
at this point.

17:55.100 --> 17:59.100
All of the exciting advances are single molecule approaches.

17:59.100 --> 18:02.100
We're rewiring pathways, genomic editing.

18:02.100 --> 18:05.100
Everything is about getting more and more specific

18:05.100 --> 18:07.100
at the low level of the hardware.

18:07.100 --> 18:08.740
And these are very important things,

18:08.740 --> 18:12.060
but they need to be coupled with an understanding

18:12.060 --> 18:13.740
of what the software looks like

18:13.740 --> 18:15.700
and how much we can get done with stimuli,

18:15.700 --> 18:19.980
not with rewiring, whether it be genetic or otherwise.

18:19.980 --> 18:22.220
And so the framework that we work in

18:22.220 --> 18:23.700
looks a little bit more like this,

18:23.740 --> 18:26.700
where yes, there's this feed forward component,

18:26.700 --> 18:29.820
but there's also a very important set of feedback loops

18:29.820 --> 18:31.540
where any challenge to the body,

18:31.540 --> 18:33.100
and this could be traumatic injury,

18:33.100 --> 18:35.580
this could be aging, this could be teratogens,

18:35.580 --> 18:39.780
pathogens, whatever triggers a set of feedback loops,

18:39.780 --> 18:41.980
both at the level of physics and genetics

18:41.980 --> 18:45.900
that serves to get back to the correct target morphology.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.280
Anybody that's taken engineering

18:47.280 --> 18:51.020
will immediately recognize this as a homeostatic cycle.

18:51.020 --> 18:52.340
It's basically what you have

18:52.700 --> 18:54.180
in your thermostatic home,

18:54.180 --> 18:57.460
where this is a system that's able to regulate

18:57.460 --> 18:59.220
back to the correct state.

18:59.220 --> 19:04.220
Now, of course, feedback is not new,

19:04.740 --> 19:08.460
biologists all understand about the importance of feedback,

19:08.460 --> 19:10.620
but there are two unusual things here in this model

19:10.620 --> 19:11.900
that I'm going to talk about.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.620
The first is that the set point

19:13.620 --> 19:16.620
for this homeostatic process is not a simple number

19:16.620 --> 19:19.260
or a scalar, like a temperature or pH or hunger level

19:19.260 --> 19:20.420
or anything like that.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.860
It's actually a much more complex structure

19:22.860 --> 19:24.860
that's a coarse-graining of the anatomy.

19:24.860 --> 19:27.380
So large-scale patterning information

19:27.380 --> 19:30.700
is what's guiding this homeostatic process.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.980
And the second part that's kind of unusual

19:32.980 --> 19:35.940
is that this is a process that has a goal.

19:35.940 --> 19:40.300
And when I say goal, this is not in some mystical sense,

19:40.300 --> 19:43.660
it's basically in the sense of cybernetics

19:43.660 --> 19:44.540
and control theory.

19:44.540 --> 19:46.700
There's a set point, and this is a system

19:46.700 --> 19:50.220
that's fundamentally able to expand energy and effort

19:50.220 --> 19:53.100
to get back to the correct region of state space

19:53.100 --> 19:57.300
by activating all kinds of cellular behaviors

19:57.300 --> 20:00.300
to get back as close as possible to minimize error

20:00.300 --> 20:01.460
and minimize the difference

20:01.460 --> 20:03.300
between whatever the current shape is

20:03.300 --> 20:04.980
and the shape that it's supposed to have.

20:04.980 --> 20:06.260
So if you make that hypothesis,

20:06.260 --> 20:08.820
it has a couple of strong predictions.

20:08.820 --> 20:12.500
One strong prediction is that you ought to be able to find

20:12.500 --> 20:15.700
the medium in which that target morphology is encoded.

20:15.700 --> 20:18.420
So the set point has to be recorded somewhere.

20:18.420 --> 20:21.460
And then it means that you could alter that set point,

20:21.460 --> 20:23.940
you could rewrite it and ask the machine

20:23.940 --> 20:27.460
to build something different without having to rewire it.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.140
In the same way that you can set your thermostat

20:29.140 --> 20:31.100
to a different temperature,

20:31.100 --> 20:33.380
and the exact same system will now maintain

20:33.380 --> 20:34.380
a different temperature

20:34.380 --> 20:36.860
because there's a distinction between the data

20:36.860 --> 20:38.340
and the execution here.

20:38.340 --> 20:39.980
So this is what we've been doing in my group

20:39.980 --> 20:41.540
for some years now is saying,

20:41.540 --> 20:44.420
can we find the representation of the target morphology

20:44.420 --> 20:46.660
and exploit it for regenerative medicine?

20:47.060 --> 20:49.540
And I think we found an important chunk of it.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.580
And so in order to tell you

20:51.580 --> 20:53.780
how that target morphology is encoded,

20:53.780 --> 20:56.980
I have to introduce you to developmental bioelectricity.

20:56.980 --> 21:01.020
And all cells in the body are sitting

21:01.020 --> 21:03.860
in a morphogenetic field of information

21:03.860 --> 21:06.820
that comes in all kinds of different media.

21:06.820 --> 21:08.180
So there's chemical gradients,

21:08.180 --> 21:11.500
extracellular matrix, tensions and stresses and so on.

21:11.500 --> 21:15.100
And then the one that we're interested in is bioelectricity.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.780
So bioelectricity is not the only important layer,

21:17.780 --> 21:20.620
but it's a, I think, a uniquely powerful and interesting one.

21:20.620 --> 21:23.020
And that's the one we'll be talking about now.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.700
Okay, so what is bioelectricity?

21:24.700 --> 21:26.620
Well, let's think about what happens in the brain.

21:26.620 --> 21:31.620
In the brain, you have networks of these cells called neurons.

21:31.900 --> 21:33.180
They all have ion channels.

21:33.180 --> 21:34.980
They create voltage potentials

21:34.980 --> 21:37.700
by passing ions in and out of these ion channels.

21:37.700 --> 21:39.900
And they can pass those electrical states

21:39.900 --> 21:42.980
to their neighbors through these little electrical synapse.

21:42.980 --> 21:45.100
The synapse is known as gap junctions.

21:45.100 --> 21:48.020
And networks of these cells have this really interesting

21:48.020 --> 21:52.380
property that they can execute physiological

21:52.380 --> 21:55.180
information processing that we associate with memory,

21:55.180 --> 21:57.460
with behavior, with goal-directed activity,

21:57.460 --> 21:59.100
with preferences and so on.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.980
And so what you can see here is an example

22:00.980 --> 22:03.860
of tracking electrical activity in the brain.

22:03.860 --> 22:05.380
So this happens to be a zebrafish,

22:05.380 --> 22:07.980
thinking about whatever the zebrafish think about.

22:07.980 --> 22:11.020
And you can literally see the electrical activity

22:11.020 --> 22:13.140
and neuroscience has the following commitment.

22:13.140 --> 22:16.220
We think that if we understood the encoding,

22:16.220 --> 22:18.740
if we understood the neural electric code,

22:18.740 --> 22:20.460
we could look at this electrical activity

22:20.460 --> 22:22.660
and extract the semantic information.

22:22.660 --> 22:26.380
We would know what is the meaning to the animal?

22:26.380 --> 22:29.220
What is the content of that memory

22:29.220 --> 22:30.420
of whatever it's thinking about?

22:30.420 --> 22:32.060
Okay, and so people are working on

22:32.060 --> 22:35.940
and have had some success with all kinds of decoding methods

22:35.940 --> 22:37.420
to try and pull that information

22:37.420 --> 22:39.540
out of electrical activity in the brain.

22:39.540 --> 22:41.140
Well, you can sort of ask yourself,

22:41.140 --> 22:42.140
where did this all come from?

22:42.140 --> 22:45.220
Certainly this didn't just evolve out of nowhere.

22:45.220 --> 22:49.700
It must have had a simpler evolutionary precursor,

22:49.700 --> 22:50.460
and it did.

22:50.460 --> 22:52.140
The evolutionary precursor is the fact

22:52.140 --> 22:54.500
that all cells do this, not just neurons.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.380
So every cell has high-end channels.

22:56.380 --> 22:59.300
Most cells have gap junctions to their neighbors.

22:59.300 --> 23:03.660
And this kind of scheme of putting

23:03.660 --> 23:06.820
electrically active subunits into networks

23:06.820 --> 23:08.740
is about as old as bacterial biofilms.

23:08.740 --> 23:11.220
It's an extremely ancient evolutionary thing.

23:11.220 --> 23:12.340
And all cells do this.

23:12.340 --> 23:16.340
And so what you're seeing here is an early frog embryo

23:16.340 --> 23:19.740
in time-lapse, where the cells are having discussions

23:19.740 --> 23:21.900
with each other electrically about who's going to be

23:21.900 --> 23:23.940
if anterior, posterior, left, right,

23:23.940 --> 23:25.460
dorsal ventral, and so on.

23:25.460 --> 23:29.700
Because whereas the electrical activity in the brain

23:29.700 --> 23:32.700
is designed to move, to activate muscles to move the body

23:32.700 --> 23:35.340
to solve problems in three-dimensional space,

23:35.340 --> 23:37.500
what developmental bioelectricity does

23:37.540 --> 23:41.060
is process information to move the body through morphospace

23:41.060 --> 23:44.100
to change and control morphogenesis.

23:44.100 --> 23:46.380
And we can do this, the exact same thing here.

23:46.380 --> 23:49.860
We can try to decode this to try to understand

23:49.860 --> 23:52.780
how is it that specific patterns arise

23:52.780 --> 23:54.300
and how can we change them?

23:55.300 --> 23:59.100
So my lab has developed some tools to do this.

23:59.100 --> 24:03.740
So first, here are voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes.

24:03.740 --> 24:05.580
And this is my colleague, Danny Adams,

24:05.580 --> 24:07.500
who has perfected this particular technique

24:07.500 --> 24:08.980
of using voltage reporters.

24:08.980 --> 24:12.100
So this is not a model, this is an actual embryo,

24:12.100 --> 24:15.780
using these voltage dyes to read in real time

24:15.780 --> 24:17.740
all the electrical conversations

24:17.740 --> 24:19.260
that these cells are having.

24:19.260 --> 24:21.620
We, of course, do lots of computational modeling.

24:21.620 --> 24:24.700
And then more importantly, we have functional techniques

24:24.700 --> 24:27.660
where you can go in and change

24:27.660 --> 24:30.820
the electrical information processing in the tissue.

24:30.820 --> 24:33.940
We do not use electrodes, applied electric fields,

24:33.940 --> 24:35.780
there's no electromagnetics going on.

24:35.780 --> 24:38.580
This is purely molecular physiology

24:38.580 --> 24:41.980
to target the native processes

24:41.980 --> 24:44.700
by which these cells are communicating electrically.

24:44.700 --> 24:49.700
So there are ways to control the topology of the network,

24:50.460 --> 24:52.740
so which cells talk to each other cells

24:52.740 --> 24:54.060
through these gap junctions.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.460
We can open them, we can close them,

24:55.460 --> 24:56.860
we can mutate them and so on.

24:56.860 --> 24:58.500
And the same thing for the ion channels.

24:58.500 --> 25:01.460
We can go in and literally set the electrical states

25:01.460 --> 25:05.060
you could either optogenetics or drugs or mutations

25:05.060 --> 25:07.020
that change the channel properties.

25:07.020 --> 25:10.820
So basically taking all the tools of neuroscience

25:10.820 --> 25:14.700
and using them to control morphogenetic decision-making

25:14.700 --> 25:17.540
outside of the nervous system.

25:17.540 --> 25:20.140
And so this is just a simple example

25:20.140 --> 25:22.620
of what some of these endogenous patterns look like.

25:22.620 --> 25:24.540
Here you see, again, a time lapse,

25:24.540 --> 25:27.860
this embryo is putting its tadpole face together.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.540
You can see all the dynamic electrical patterns.

25:30.580 --> 25:32.580
Here's one frame from that movie.

25:32.580 --> 25:33.460
And the amazing thing is,

25:33.460 --> 25:35.340
and the reason I love this example so much

25:35.340 --> 25:37.780
is that the encoding is really simple here.

25:37.780 --> 25:39.700
The electric, we call this the electric face.

25:39.700 --> 25:42.620
The bi-electric pattern of the face actually looks like a face.

25:42.620 --> 25:45.660
And this shows up before the genes are turned on

25:46.580 --> 25:49.380
to regionalize the face.

25:49.380 --> 25:50.220
And so here you can see,

25:50.220 --> 25:51.620
here's where the eye is going to be,

25:51.620 --> 25:52.540
here are the placodes,

25:52.540 --> 25:54.260
here's where the mouth is going to be.

25:54.260 --> 25:57.620
All these bi-electrical gradients are a pre-pattern.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.340
They're a subtle scaffold

25:59.340 --> 26:02.140
that directs downstream gene expression and anatomy.

26:02.140 --> 26:05.260
And if we go in and we change the distribution

26:05.260 --> 26:06.420
of voltages here,

26:06.420 --> 26:07.820
you will change the gene expression

26:07.820 --> 26:08.900
and you will change the anatomy.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.940
That is one way to make those Picasso tadpoles

26:10.940 --> 26:11.980
that I showed you about.

26:11.980 --> 26:16.780
So this is a native pattern that is required.

26:16.780 --> 26:19.900
It's a normal, natural part of specifying

26:19.900 --> 26:21.740
what the tadpole face is going to look like.

26:21.740 --> 26:23.420
Here's a pathological pattern.

26:23.420 --> 26:25.180
What we've done here is,

26:25.180 --> 26:28.460
what we've done here is inject a human oncogene

26:28.460 --> 26:29.300
into this tadpole.

26:29.300 --> 26:31.020
They will make tumors like this.

26:31.020 --> 26:32.140
But before they do,

26:32.140 --> 26:36.060
you can already see using this bi-electric map,

26:36.060 --> 26:38.340
you can already see that these cells

26:38.340 --> 26:40.540
have a really aberrant electrical potential.

26:40.540 --> 26:42.980
They are dissociating from the electrical network.

26:42.980 --> 26:46.260
They're basically reverting back to their unicellular state

26:46.260 --> 26:47.900
and they're going to treat the rest of the animal

26:47.900 --> 26:49.260
as just external environment.

26:49.260 --> 26:51.180
They've unplugged from the collective

26:51.180 --> 26:52.380
and this is metastasis.

26:53.340 --> 26:56.300
This is failure to participate in embryogenesis

26:56.300 --> 26:57.980
because the first thing that oncogenes do

26:57.980 --> 27:00.940
is uncouple you from the electric network

27:00.940 --> 27:03.860
that normally tells every cell what it should be doing.

27:04.980 --> 27:07.260
So the reason we know this is important

27:07.260 --> 27:09.460
is that if you inject tumors

27:09.460 --> 27:11.980
like nasty KRAS mutations and so on,

27:11.980 --> 27:14.860
if you inject these things and cause tumors,

27:14.860 --> 27:17.500
you can prevent the actual tumor genesis

27:17.500 --> 27:19.780
even though the oncogene is very strongly expressed.

27:19.780 --> 27:21.460
So here, this is the same animal.

27:21.460 --> 27:24.420
So here's the oncogene that we've labeled it with red,

27:24.420 --> 27:27.860
very strongly expressed and yet there's no tumor

27:27.860 --> 27:29.860
because what we've done is co-inject an ion channel

27:29.860 --> 27:33.220
that forces these cells into a voltage state

27:33.220 --> 27:36.020
that keeps them coupled to the rest of the electrical network

27:36.020 --> 27:37.740
and they simply don't progress

27:37.740 --> 27:40.980
to tumor genesis or metastasis.

27:40.980 --> 27:42.980
So we know this is instructive.

27:42.980 --> 27:45.980
Now, going beyond the single cell property

27:45.980 --> 27:49.220
of conversion to cancer,

27:49.220 --> 27:50.500
we could look at morphogenesis

27:50.500 --> 27:52.460
and we can say, okay, here's a tadpole.

27:52.460 --> 27:54.300
Let's take a region of the gut.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.100
So here, these are some cells in the embryo

27:56.100 --> 27:57.660
that are going to become gut

27:57.660 --> 27:59.620
and we're going to inject some ion channels

27:59.620 --> 28:01.940
that will set a voltage state

28:01.940 --> 28:04.380
that normally is associated with making an eye.

28:04.380 --> 28:05.220
And guess what happens?

28:05.220 --> 28:07.100
These cells, once you instruct them that way,

28:07.100 --> 28:08.580
they will in fact build an eye

28:08.580 --> 28:10.860
out of cells that were fated to be gut

28:10.860 --> 28:12.140
and you can make these eyes anywhere,

28:12.140 --> 28:14.580
on the tails, spinal cord, in the gut, whatever.

28:14.580 --> 28:16.420
They have all the correct layers,

28:16.420 --> 28:18.260
the retina, optic nerve, all of that.

28:18.340 --> 28:21.420
And also pretty cool is that they instruct their neighbors.

28:21.420 --> 28:23.260
So these blue cells here are the ones

28:23.260 --> 28:24.620
whose voltage we changed

28:24.620 --> 28:26.580
and they recruited a whole bunch of other cells

28:26.580 --> 28:28.060
which we never touched directly, right?

28:28.060 --> 28:29.700
These are just neighboring cells

28:29.700 --> 28:31.900
that they recruit to make this nice lens

28:31.900 --> 28:35.460
that's sitting out in the tail of this tadpole.

28:35.460 --> 28:37.460
And so we can use this technique.

28:37.460 --> 28:41.740
We can induce eyes, brains, hearts and other things.

28:41.740 --> 28:43.180
And then there's many things that we can't,

28:43.180 --> 28:44.420
we don't know how to make it.

28:44.420 --> 28:46.620
So the point is that these bioelectrical gradients

28:46.620 --> 28:49.020
are instructive for anatomy.

28:49.020 --> 28:51.220
They control at the large scale.

28:51.220 --> 28:54.060
And one of the most important features of this

28:54.060 --> 28:56.860
is that we don't have to micromanage this process.

28:56.860 --> 29:01.100
So what we basically found is an instructive hooking

29:01.100 --> 29:03.380
to subroutines that say make an eye here

29:03.380 --> 29:05.180
or make a heart here or make a brain here.

29:05.180 --> 29:07.180
We don't have to go in and give all the information about,

29:07.180 --> 29:08.100
well, how do you make an eye?

29:08.100 --> 29:09.180
What are all the layers?

29:09.180 --> 29:11.140
What are all the cell differentiation cascades?

29:11.140 --> 29:12.860
What are all the genes that have to be expressed?

29:12.860 --> 29:14.340
That would be incredibly difficult.

29:14.340 --> 29:16.420
We're nowhere near being able to do that

29:16.420 --> 29:18.500
as a field, but what you can do

29:18.500 --> 29:23.500
is find the native modular control structure

29:24.900 --> 29:27.420
in the bioelectric layer

29:27.420 --> 29:30.900
that determines which organs get placed in what regions.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.660
And then the cells will take it from there

29:32.660 --> 29:34.380
once you've instructed them what to do.

29:34.380 --> 29:37.420
They will turn on all the things they need.

29:37.420 --> 29:39.260
So let's look at the planaria

29:39.260 --> 29:41.500
because this is really interesting.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.900
In a planarian, you chop off the head and the tail.

29:43.900 --> 29:44.980
You got this middle fragment,

29:45.220 --> 29:48.060
the middle fragment has to know to build a new head here

29:48.060 --> 29:49.020
and a new tail here.

29:49.020 --> 29:50.180
How does it know to do that?

29:50.180 --> 29:52.020
Well, it has this interesting voltage gradient

29:52.020 --> 29:54.540
that says one head here in this depolarized region,

29:54.540 --> 29:55.620
one tail here.

29:55.620 --> 29:58.220
And if we go in and we artificially manipulate

29:58.220 --> 30:00.580
the voltage back here to be depolarized,

30:00.580 --> 30:02.740
then sure enough, these cells will build what you said

30:02.740 --> 30:04.460
and they will make a two-headed animal.

30:04.460 --> 30:05.820
And these are perfectly viable.

30:05.820 --> 30:07.060
So you can make a two-headed animal,

30:07.060 --> 30:08.980
you can make a no-headed animal, okay?

30:08.980 --> 30:10.580
So again, instructive,

30:10.580 --> 30:13.940
and all we've done is activate the build ahead subroutine

30:13.940 --> 30:16.220
and we've done it here at this particular region

30:16.220 --> 30:18.460
without actually knowing too much about how you go

30:18.460 --> 30:20.060
about building ahead in the first place.

30:20.060 --> 30:24.300
The cells will turn on and off all the genes that they need

30:24.300 --> 30:26.980
once they've received this high-level instruction

30:26.980 --> 30:29.780
about what organ they're supposed to build.

30:29.780 --> 30:33.380
Not only can you build ectopic heads of the same animal,

30:33.380 --> 30:36.460
you can actually build heads appropriate to other species.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.540
Okay, so if we take this planarian

30:38.540 --> 30:41.420
with a nice triangular head here, chop off the head,

30:41.420 --> 30:43.060
perturb the electrical network

30:43.060 --> 30:46.140
and you can get flat heads like a Pifelina,

30:46.140 --> 30:48.980
you can get round heads like an S-Mediterranean,

30:48.980 --> 30:50.780
or you can get your normal triangular heads.

30:50.780 --> 30:52.860
And not only do you get the head shape,

30:52.860 --> 30:55.500
but actually the brain shape changes

30:55.500 --> 30:57.180
in the distribution of stem cells

30:57.180 --> 30:59.820
becomes just like these other species

30:59.820 --> 31:02.580
because the space of possible outcomes

31:02.580 --> 31:05.140
of this electrical circuit contains attractors

31:05.140 --> 31:07.480
that correspond to other species

31:07.480 --> 31:09.780
that evolution has found in the past, okay?

31:09.780 --> 31:12.740
And you can dial in those without any changes

31:12.740 --> 31:14.140
to the genomics, so both in here

31:14.140 --> 31:16.060
and in the two-headed animals I showed you,

31:16.060 --> 31:17.100
there's nothing wrong with the genome.

31:17.100 --> 31:18.980
The genetics are completely wild type.

31:18.980 --> 31:21.060
This is modifying the information

31:21.060 --> 31:23.380
stored in the electrical network

31:23.380 --> 31:26.140
and you can access other attractors

31:26.140 --> 31:27.580
that belong to other species

31:27.580 --> 31:30.860
with the exact same genetically normal cells.

31:30.860 --> 31:33.140
And in fact, you can access regions of that state space

31:33.140 --> 31:35.720
that evolution doesn't use because they're not viable.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.580
You can take flat planaria and turn them

31:37.580 --> 31:39.500
into these weird spiky forms.

31:39.500 --> 31:42.340
You can make these three-dimensional things

31:42.340 --> 31:43.740
that look like hats.

31:43.740 --> 31:46.180
You can make this kind of thing,

31:46.180 --> 31:47.700
which are sort of combinations.

31:47.700 --> 31:49.780
The flatworms don't even need to be flat anymore.

31:49.780 --> 31:53.980
And so the idea here is that you can really have

31:53.980 --> 31:56.340
drastic control over large-scale anatomy

31:56.340 --> 31:59.700
given the same genome because what the genome builds

31:59.700 --> 32:03.420
is cellular collectives that use electricity

32:03.420 --> 32:08.420
to store their set points, their target morphologies.

32:08.740 --> 32:11.060
And this should sound like a very familiar story

32:11.780 --> 32:13.660
for neuroscientists because that's exactly

32:13.660 --> 32:15.260
how brains work.

32:15.260 --> 32:19.980
So getting to the sort of applied regenerative medicine side

32:19.980 --> 32:22.580
of this, unlike salamanders, frogs

32:22.580 --> 32:24.780
do not regenerate their legs.

32:24.780 --> 32:27.780
And what we've done is we've taken froglets

32:27.780 --> 32:29.300
and we've designed, we've used this information

32:29.300 --> 32:32.340
to design a cocktail of drugs

32:32.340 --> 32:34.420
that change the electrical state of the wound.

32:34.420 --> 32:35.900
And you can see here normally in the frog,

32:35.900 --> 32:37.900
you amputate the leg and there's basically nothing

32:38.180 --> 32:40.020
in 45 days.

32:40.020 --> 32:43.500
We add the cocktail, the application's actually

32:43.500 --> 32:47.420
just for 48 hours, sorry, 24 hours, so one day.

32:47.420 --> 32:49.140
And after that one day exposure,

32:49.140 --> 32:50.820
it kick starts the whole cascade.

32:50.820 --> 32:52.980
So here pro regenerative genes become turned on.

32:52.980 --> 32:54.420
So this is MSX1.

32:54.420 --> 32:57.060
And then immediately you start growing this leg.

32:57.060 --> 32:58.900
By 45 days later, you've got some toes,

32:58.900 --> 33:01.580
you've got a toenail, eventually a very nice leg.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.700
And you can see that the leg is

33:03.700 --> 33:05.900
both touch sensitive and motile.

33:05.900 --> 33:09.940
So what you can do is override the normal program

33:09.940 --> 33:12.100
of growth, which is normally very little,

33:12.100 --> 33:15.220
and give the whole thing of a simple signal

33:15.220 --> 33:18.740
over 24 hours that then is picked up

33:18.740 --> 33:21.020
by all the transcriptional cascades and everything else

33:21.020 --> 33:22.300
that will work over months.

33:22.300 --> 33:25.300
In fact, our latest paper, 13 months of leg growth

33:25.300 --> 33:27.540
following one day treatment.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.220
And so we've looked at this in,

33:31.220 --> 33:32.300
so these are frogs and worms,

33:32.300 --> 33:34.540
we've looked at this in human mesenchymal stem cells

33:34.540 --> 33:36.100
and cardiomyocytes and so on.

33:36.100 --> 33:38.820
And it's very highly conserved.

33:38.820 --> 33:41.740
It works throughout the tree of life.

33:41.740 --> 33:43.620
We know it's relevant to humans

33:43.620 --> 33:45.420
because of human channelopathies.

33:45.420 --> 33:48.460
So lots of human ion channel mutations give rise

33:48.460 --> 33:49.980
to different kinds of birth defects,

33:49.980 --> 33:52.140
telling us that even in humans,

33:52.140 --> 33:54.700
these electrical properties are very important

33:54.700 --> 33:56.980
for setting correct morphologies.

33:56.980 --> 33:57.820
And so what we do now,

33:57.820 --> 34:00.220
and so this is our company with David Kaplan,

34:01.060 --> 34:05.900
we have a company that's focused on David's lab

34:05.900 --> 34:07.340
builds these bioreactors,

34:07.340 --> 34:12.340
which basically deliver cocktails of ion channel drugs

34:12.380 --> 34:16.260
that are picked by us to induce pro-regenerative states.

34:16.260 --> 34:18.660
And we are now having more or less solved it in frog.

34:18.660 --> 34:21.860
We are now in mammals, we're doing this in mice.

34:21.860 --> 34:25.540
And then hopefully someday hopefully humans, of course.

34:25.540 --> 34:28.900
So just to start wrapping up here,

34:28.940 --> 34:30.460
the point of all of this is that

34:30.460 --> 34:33.060
we now are starting to understand the circuits

34:33.060 --> 34:35.660
to the point where we can make multi-scale models.

34:35.660 --> 34:37.700
So we start with knowing what genes are there

34:37.700 --> 34:40.140
to produce various types of ion channels,

34:40.140 --> 34:41.660
but these ion channels open and close.

34:41.660 --> 34:43.020
So simply knowing the genes

34:43.020 --> 34:45.220
doesn't tell you what the electrical states are going to be.

34:45.220 --> 34:47.860
You have to simulate the physiological tissues

34:47.860 --> 34:50.180
and those give rise to larger organ structures.

34:50.180 --> 34:53.260
And eventually you can get down to algorithmic types

34:53.260 --> 34:56.340
of control that show you how the electrical activity

34:56.340 --> 34:58.420
in these tissues makes decisions

34:58.420 --> 35:00.020
about what's going to go where.

35:00.020 --> 35:03.300
So you go from the genomically specified hardware

35:03.300 --> 35:06.700
to the low level and then the higher level software

35:06.700 --> 35:10.180
that allows these cells to make the kinds of decisions

35:10.180 --> 35:14.420
to robustly create and repair complex morphologies, okay?

35:14.420 --> 35:16.060
And so in that process, of course,

35:16.060 --> 35:19.220
there's a huge opportunity for application

35:19.220 --> 35:20.060
for machine learning.

35:20.060 --> 35:21.060
And so we've done some of this,

35:21.060 --> 35:24.700
use machine learning to both discover the electrical circuits

35:24.700 --> 35:26.580
and to discover the modulations

35:26.580 --> 35:29.940
that are needed to use these therapeutically.

35:29.940 --> 35:31.380
And just as a very simple,

35:31.380 --> 35:33.140
I'll just close up here with a couple of slides

35:33.140 --> 35:34.940
to show you a very simple example.

35:34.940 --> 35:38.660
This is what a normal tadpole brain looks like.

35:38.660 --> 35:41.140
And if you perturb it with a mutation,

35:41.140 --> 35:43.300
let's say in a really important gene like notch,

35:43.300 --> 35:45.100
which basically the forebrain is gone,

35:45.100 --> 35:47.100
the midbrain is a bubble,

35:47.100 --> 35:49.020
the hindbrain is also a bubble,

35:49.020 --> 35:51.260
it's just they have no behavior that's laid there.

35:51.260 --> 35:53.540
And what you can do is create a model

35:53.540 --> 35:56.780
with the bioelectric circuit that determines brain shape

35:56.780 --> 35:59.300
and ask it in under circumstances like this,

35:59.300 --> 36:00.860
that either there's a mutation

36:00.860 --> 36:03.380
or they've been hit by alcohol or nicotine

36:03.380 --> 36:04.740
or some other kind of poison,

36:06.860 --> 36:08.340
what would you have to change?

36:08.340 --> 36:09.820
Which channels would you open and close

36:09.820 --> 36:12.500
to get back to this correct bioelectric pattern

36:12.500 --> 36:15.060
that is responsible for a normal brain?

36:15.060 --> 36:17.380
And so the model is actually now sufficiently detailed

36:17.380 --> 36:20.140
that it can actually tell us what channel is

36:20.140 --> 36:22.060
and using that we can pick drugs.

36:22.060 --> 36:26.460
So known ion channel drugs and when you do this,

36:26.460 --> 36:29.380
you get back the correct brain shape,

36:29.380 --> 36:32.900
the correct brain size and you get their behavior,

36:32.900 --> 36:33.820
you get their IQs back,

36:33.820 --> 36:35.660
so their learning rates are back to normal,

36:35.660 --> 36:39.380
despite the fact that they've had really debilitating mutations

36:39.380 --> 36:42.220
or exposure to teratogens like nicotine or alcohol

36:42.220 --> 36:43.340
and so on.

36:43.340 --> 36:45.780
Okay, so this is an example of starting off

36:45.780 --> 36:48.780
with a basic understanding of bioelectric circuits

36:48.780 --> 36:51.580
and how they work to a computational model

36:51.580 --> 36:53.780
that actually helps you design therapeutics

36:53.780 --> 36:55.940
to fix a rather complex outcome,

36:55.940 --> 36:57.700
which is brain development.

36:57.700 --> 36:59.380
Okay, and so what we are doing now

36:59.380 --> 37:02.620
is we're trying to create a complete pipeline

37:02.620 --> 37:05.740
where you start off with existing information

37:05.740 --> 37:08.660
on what ion channels are in your tissue of interest,

37:08.660 --> 37:10.700
what bioelectrical state do you want

37:10.700 --> 37:13.100
and then use the model and the simulations

37:13.100 --> 37:17.020
to tell you what channel openers and blockers do you need,

37:17.020 --> 37:19.540
something like 20% of all drugs are ion channel drugs.

37:19.540 --> 37:23.260
So there's this huge toolkit that we call electroseuticals,

37:23.260 --> 37:27.060
which with the correct computational simulations,

37:27.060 --> 37:31.180
you can actually start to deploy outside of things

37:31.180 --> 37:33.660
like cardiac arrhythmia as an epilepsy,

37:33.660 --> 37:35.860
as all those drugs can be repurposed now

37:35.860 --> 37:38.020
for regenerative medicine.

37:38.020 --> 37:40.340
And so this is an example of our software,

37:40.340 --> 37:43.100
you can all play with it.

37:43.100 --> 37:45.020
It's online and the idea is that you would pick

37:45.020 --> 37:47.980
the tissues you want and it would actually help you

37:48.980 --> 37:51.380
pick the correct drugs.

37:51.380 --> 37:55.580
So I'll just close here and just summarize what I've told you

37:55.580 --> 37:57.980
is that there's this incredibly powerful

37:57.980 --> 38:00.100
physiological software layer

38:00.100 --> 38:02.660
that sits between the genotype and the anatomy.

38:02.660 --> 38:04.380
And it's a really trackable target

38:04.380 --> 38:06.380
for regenerative biomedicine.

38:06.380 --> 38:08.020
Evolution discovered very early

38:08.020 --> 38:11.020
that electrical signaling is a really convenient medium

38:11.020 --> 38:13.700
for computation and global decision-making.

38:13.700 --> 38:15.100
And this is why brains exploit it,

38:15.100 --> 38:17.140
this is why our computer technology exploits it

38:17.180 --> 38:20.300
and this is why morphogenesis runs on the system.

38:20.300 --> 38:23.220
Cracking this code, you can really give us the opportunity

38:23.220 --> 38:26.300
to rewrite the pattern memories

38:26.300 --> 38:30.700
that allow us to control large-scale shape.

38:30.700 --> 38:31.820
And when I say pattern memories,

38:31.820 --> 38:34.420
I mean, these are literally those two-headed worms

38:34.420 --> 38:36.700
that I showed you, if you now cut them into pieces

38:36.700 --> 38:38.820
with no more manipulation of any kind,

38:38.820 --> 38:40.660
they continue to make two-headed animals,

38:40.660 --> 38:42.860
even though their genomes are wild type, okay?

38:42.860 --> 38:46.780
This is that memory, that electrical circuit

38:46.780 --> 38:49.380
really keeps the memory and so you can set it back

38:49.380 --> 38:51.380
to being one-headed, but until you do that,

38:51.380 --> 38:54.580
the pieces will continue to make two-headed worms, okay?

38:54.580 --> 38:57.100
And so new artificial intelligence tools

38:57.100 --> 38:59.420
are now coming online to help us design

38:59.420 --> 39:00.340
these kinds of strategies.

39:00.340 --> 39:03.900
So it's now rational design to address birth defects,

39:03.900 --> 39:05.660
cancer and regeneration.

39:05.660 --> 39:07.380
And also our latest work has been

39:07.380 --> 39:10.060
on making synthetic living organisms.

39:10.060 --> 39:13.380
So with that, I'd like to thank the people

39:13.380 --> 39:15.780
who contributed to all this work,

39:15.780 --> 39:20.140
our funders, and I'll thank all of you for listening.

39:20.140 --> 39:22.940
And if we could take a five-minute break

39:22.940 --> 39:25.300
and then I'll come back and I'm happy to answer

39:25.300 --> 39:26.220
any questions.

39:27.100 --> 39:28.460
Wow, that was a lot.

39:28.460 --> 39:29.900
I think we do need a break.

39:29.900 --> 39:32.740
We will let you go for now and have you back in five minutes.

39:32.740 --> 39:34.420
Thank you so, so much already.

39:34.420 --> 39:35.860
And there's lots of questions in the chat,

39:35.860 --> 39:38.340
but I will moderate them and we'll see you in a bit.

39:38.340 --> 39:39.860
Perfect, five minutes.

39:39.860 --> 39:41.180
Okay, sounds great.

39:41.180 --> 39:42.300
Okay, lovely.

39:42.300 --> 39:45.180
Well, that was quite a lot to digest.

39:45.180 --> 39:46.820
I'll keep the questions coming and also

39:46.820 --> 39:49.380
upvote the ones that you want to push forward.

39:49.380 --> 39:52.420
He already agreed that he can stay on for half an hour,

39:52.420 --> 39:53.580
up to half an hour longer.

39:53.580 --> 39:56.620
So for those of you who want to learn more about this,

39:56.620 --> 39:57.900
feel free to join longer.

39:57.900 --> 40:01.060
For now, we have lots of exciting community updates,

40:01.060 --> 40:03.580
lots of exciting projects and events

40:03.580 --> 40:05.660
and fellowships and hackathons and so forth

40:05.660 --> 40:06.620
in the community.

40:06.620 --> 40:08.660
We will start with Elena.

40:08.660 --> 40:10.380
Elena, if you're here, feel free to unmute

40:10.380 --> 40:13.300
and tell us about your upcoming conference.

40:14.300 --> 40:16.540
Yeah, hello everyone.

40:16.540 --> 40:20.660
Very nice to see a lot of useful developments in the field

40:20.660 --> 40:21.980
and hear all those awesome talks.

40:21.980 --> 40:24.020
I'm actually a very big fan of this group,

40:24.020 --> 40:26.420
even though not always can I attend.

40:26.420 --> 40:29.980
Anyways, I just wanted to let you know that soon

40:29.980 --> 40:33.780
we're going to have our fourth annual conference

40:33.780 --> 40:37.100
and in Agile of the Diseases 2021.

40:37.100 --> 40:40.020
It's going to take place virtually this year again

40:40.020 --> 40:42.100
because we're not so sure that it's safe

40:42.540 --> 40:44.620
for all of us together.

40:44.620 --> 40:47.340
We hope that it will change in the next years, of course.

40:47.340 --> 40:51.660
So the conference is going to take place on August 1922

40:51.660 --> 40:54.980
and in the Eastern time zone.

40:54.980 --> 40:57.500
So we will focus on the four traditional topics,

40:57.500 --> 41:00.220
which will be the mechanisms of aging,

41:00.220 --> 41:03.820
the human trials of rejuvenation by technology therapies,

41:03.820 --> 41:05.180
the biomarkers of aging,

41:05.180 --> 41:07.300
and of course traditionally investment matters

41:07.300 --> 41:08.580
and regulatory matters.

41:09.580 --> 41:13.980
As usual, we have a number of prominent researchers

41:13.980 --> 41:14.940
giving their talks.

41:14.940 --> 41:17.700
Some of the information is going to be pretty fresh

41:17.700 --> 41:18.580
just from the lab.

41:18.580 --> 41:21.380
So I hope that you will have a look

41:21.380 --> 41:22.980
at the program of the conference

41:22.980 --> 41:27.180
and probably get inspired and come join us this year.

41:27.180 --> 41:30.580
For more information, please visit our website,

41:30.580 --> 41:33.420
lifespan.io slash conference.

41:33.420 --> 41:38.380
And as a way to support this community,

41:38.380 --> 41:40.860
you are welcome to apply my promo code

41:40.860 --> 41:43.740
for site 2021 to get the discount.

41:43.740 --> 41:48.060
I will drop a link that will automatically apply a discount

41:48.060 --> 41:49.300
in the chat of this call,

41:49.300 --> 41:52.100
just in case you would like to proceed right away.

41:53.820 --> 41:54.660
Thank you so much.

41:54.660 --> 41:55.500
Lovely.

41:55.500 --> 41:56.340
Okay.

41:56.340 --> 41:57.660
Next on up, we have Anastasia.

41:57.660 --> 41:58.940
Anastasia, are you here?

42:02.660 --> 42:04.300
Oh, can you hear me?

42:04.300 --> 42:05.140
Yes.

42:05.140 --> 42:07.300
Wow, lovely background.

42:07.300 --> 42:08.140
Thank you.

42:08.140 --> 42:09.300
It's Idaho.

42:09.300 --> 42:10.140
Yeah.

42:10.140 --> 42:10.980
Thanks, Alison.

42:10.980 --> 42:15.980
And great to meet you all on this regular meetings

42:15.980 --> 42:17.940
that are really great and informative.

42:19.140 --> 42:20.580
Some of you might know me.

42:20.580 --> 42:22.980
And so I work with Ranjan.

42:22.980 --> 42:25.260
Ranjan is the founder of R42 Group.

42:25.260 --> 42:28.620
We are a fund and also investing in AI and longevity

42:28.620 --> 42:30.540
and also an institute.

42:30.540 --> 42:34.060
Part of our institute that we have is Fellowship.

42:34.060 --> 42:35.300
So it's AI Fellowship.

42:35.300 --> 42:37.660
And we're now in our cohort four.

42:37.660 --> 42:40.180
And our demo day is actually tomorrow

42:40.180 --> 42:43.300
between 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. noon Pacific.

42:43.300 --> 42:45.660
Some really great projects.

42:45.660 --> 42:48.020
Students from all over the world were working

42:48.020 --> 42:50.340
on these projects over the 12 week period.

42:50.340 --> 42:54.420
So they include mathematics, adventure capital,

42:54.420 --> 42:56.100
no code, machine learning platform

42:56.100 --> 43:00.860
for biomedical researchers, cancer biology,

43:00.860 --> 43:04.420
just kind of a wide range of really exciting projects.

43:04.420 --> 43:06.220
So you're all welcome to come.

43:06.220 --> 43:08.180
And I'll send you the schedule

43:08.180 --> 43:10.740
and also the registration link in the chat,

43:10.740 --> 43:14.060
as well as, yeah, feel free to pop in and out

43:14.060 --> 43:15.740
and come for all our new presentations.

43:15.740 --> 43:17.300
So, yeah, great.

43:18.500 --> 43:19.340
And yes.

43:19.340 --> 43:20.420
Thank you.

43:20.420 --> 43:22.660
Here, you might add a few words.

43:25.180 --> 43:27.060
Let us know in case you wanna do so, Ranjan.

43:27.060 --> 43:28.780
Otherwise, we look forward to-

43:28.780 --> 43:29.740
Yes, that's okay.

43:29.740 --> 43:30.580
It's free.

43:30.580 --> 43:31.420
I'll just add it's free.

43:32.220 --> 43:36.380
And we're gonna have the first holographic telephone call

43:36.380 --> 43:39.940
tomorrow between England and Silicon Valley.

43:39.940 --> 43:43.260
So that'll be around about 11 a.m. Pacific.

43:43.260 --> 43:44.100
Exciting stuff.

43:44.100 --> 43:45.860
You're taking the A.I. theme very meta.

43:45.860 --> 43:47.020
Okay, lovely.

43:47.020 --> 43:48.580
Next one up, we have Dima.

43:50.100 --> 43:51.540
Yeah, hi, everyone.

43:51.540 --> 43:54.460
So we're organizing a longevity hackathon.

43:54.460 --> 43:57.020
So it's a 48 hour event

43:57.020 --> 44:00.420
to bring the ideas to fruition in longevity

44:00.420 --> 44:03.340
and the ideas to bring together longevity researchers,

44:03.340 --> 44:07.660
developers, A.I. scientists, entrepreneurs,

44:07.660 --> 44:09.780
attract people from outside the field as well,

44:09.780 --> 44:12.660
help them build teams and tackle the kind of

44:12.660 --> 44:14.620
like long hanging fruits that you can actually,

44:14.620 --> 44:17.460
or you can actually produce innovation over just 48 hours.

44:17.460 --> 44:21.140
So if there's topics from biotech, A.I., pharma,

44:21.140 --> 44:23.700
we already have people from all continents,

44:23.700 --> 44:26.500
except perhaps like Antarctica and Australia,

44:26.500 --> 44:29.460
but like there's people joining from all over the world.

44:29.460 --> 44:31.660
There's longevity tech funds.

44:31.660 --> 44:35.820
We'll invest 100K into the winning teams.

44:35.820 --> 44:38.540
So I'm also confident that this will continue afterwards.

44:38.540 --> 44:40.620
And then Forsyte Institute is also supporting

44:40.620 --> 44:43.460
with the fellowship for 2022.

44:43.460 --> 44:45.580
So yeah, please join.

44:45.580 --> 44:47.980
We're still looking for sponsors and mentors

44:47.980 --> 44:48.820
filled with each other.

44:48.820 --> 44:52.260
And I'm gonna drop it in chat as well.

44:52.260 --> 44:54.020
The information about it.

44:54.020 --> 44:54.860
Thank you.

44:54.860 --> 44:55.940
Okay, I have one more to go,

44:55.940 --> 44:58.500
which is the Aging Research and Drug Development Conference

44:58.540 --> 45:01.660
in Copenhagen on August 31st to September 3rd.

45:01.660 --> 45:02.980
I'll drop a link to that.

45:02.980 --> 45:04.260
And as you can tell,

45:04.260 --> 45:06.140
there's lots of exciting stuff happening.

45:06.140 --> 45:10.660
Nathan, I think is on the call for the fellowship.

45:10.660 --> 45:11.620
I reached out to you earlier,

45:11.620 --> 45:13.700
if you wanna say something to your feet to do so now,

45:13.700 --> 45:14.700
or in the chat.

45:16.540 --> 45:19.580
Otherwise, I think we have Michael back.

45:19.580 --> 45:21.420
Okay, Michael, are you back?

45:21.420 --> 45:22.260
I'm back.

45:22.260 --> 45:23.380
Okay, lovely.

45:23.380 --> 45:24.300
Okay, great.

45:24.460 --> 45:29.260
I think let's do maybe a few questions on the record.

45:29.260 --> 45:31.700
And if anyone prefers to have theirs off the record,

45:31.700 --> 45:33.980
then I'll turn the recording off for that.

45:33.980 --> 45:35.540
I think some people just prefer that

45:35.540 --> 45:37.660
for a more open discussion.

45:37.660 --> 45:39.980
But the first one that got uploaded a bunch is Carl.

45:39.980 --> 45:41.660
Carl asked, I think three questions

45:41.660 --> 45:43.220
so you can make your pick now.

45:43.220 --> 45:44.420
No pressure on you.

45:44.420 --> 45:45.420
This is totally good.

45:45.420 --> 45:47.300
These are good questions to be on the record

45:47.300 --> 45:49.420
because well, I mean, first of all,

45:49.420 --> 45:50.540
just let me say kudos.

45:50.540 --> 45:53.260
This is very awesome sounding stuff

45:53.260 --> 45:55.860
and kind of blows me away a little bit.

45:55.860 --> 45:59.980
So before getting into aging and regenerative medicine

45:59.980 --> 46:03.260
even just more basic back,

46:03.260 --> 46:05.300
I have loads of more basic background questions

46:05.300 --> 46:06.980
about these bioelectric networks.

46:06.980 --> 46:08.420
So the meta question in,

46:08.420 --> 46:10.180
I'll just give two example questions.

46:10.180 --> 46:15.180
The meta question that the myriad of questions raises

46:15.780 --> 46:19.660
is what's the best modern review or textbook

46:19.660 --> 46:22.060
that introduces all those people who don't know anything

46:22.060 --> 46:23.700
about these bioelectric networks to that.

46:23.700 --> 46:27.620
But so the two example questions I had right away were,

46:27.620 --> 46:29.940
what is the down, you know, what is within a cell,

46:29.940 --> 46:34.220
what is the pathway for this bioelectrics

46:34.220 --> 46:37.740
to actually control gene expression, right?

46:37.740 --> 46:40.540
So what's going on in the cell that way?

46:40.540 --> 46:42.660
How does it work epigenetically?

46:42.660 --> 46:45.900
And then the other question I wrote was,

46:46.420 --> 46:51.420
in non-regenerative species after development,

46:52.220 --> 46:54.780
what do these bioelectric networks do with anything?

46:54.780 --> 46:56.180
Yeah, yeah, great.

46:56.180 --> 46:57.660
Okay, three questions.

46:57.660 --> 47:00.060
Let's see, as far as reviews.

47:00.060 --> 47:03.500
So I have lots, I've written lots.

47:03.500 --> 47:05.340
A couple of other people have written some good ones.

47:05.340 --> 47:07.740
Anybody who's interested, please email me.

47:07.740 --> 47:10.100
Or if you guys have some sort of a form

47:10.100 --> 47:11.860
that I can post this at, I will post.

47:11.860 --> 47:14.780
If you just tell Alison later offline, she can forward it.

47:14.780 --> 47:15.620
Sure, yeah, I will.

47:16.140 --> 47:19.660
Yeah, we've written tons of very basic reviews

47:19.660 --> 47:21.260
on this stuff, taking you from zero

47:21.260 --> 47:22.700
all the way to what's known today.

47:22.700 --> 47:27.700
Okay, the second question is a transduction to gene expression.

47:28.380 --> 47:33.380
So on the single cell level,

47:34.140 --> 47:36.500
we know there are about half a dozen ways

47:36.500 --> 47:40.780
in which voltage change regulates downstream gene expression.

47:40.780 --> 47:42.940
So this includes things that you're familiar with,

47:42.940 --> 47:44.020
the neuroscience, for example,

47:44.020 --> 47:45.620
voltage-gated calcium signals

47:45.620 --> 47:47.500
followed by calcium transduction.

47:47.500 --> 47:50.780
This includes control of neurotransmitter movement

47:50.780 --> 47:53.340
like serotonin between cells through gap junctions

47:53.340 --> 47:55.660
or through the serotonin transporter.

47:55.660 --> 47:57.500
And this includes some more exotic things

47:57.500 --> 47:59.500
like voltage-sensitive phosphatases.

47:59.500 --> 48:02.580
It includes things like voltage-gated butyrate transporters

48:02.580 --> 48:05.420
that then hit HDAC and those kind of

48:05.420 --> 48:08.020
epichromatin modification pathways.

48:08.020 --> 48:09.420
All of that is known.

48:09.420 --> 48:14.420
I should say, though, that it's highly unsatisfying

48:15.900 --> 48:17.740
because what that, I mean, it's good information,

48:17.740 --> 48:18.700
it's good to have that.

48:18.700 --> 48:22.260
The problem is all of that is single cell level data.

48:22.260 --> 48:25.020
And if you want to know why your hand

48:25.020 --> 48:26.420
doesn't look like your foot,

48:26.420 --> 48:29.180
it's good to know the transduction on the single cell level,

48:29.180 --> 48:33.380
but you still have to ask about global dynamics

48:33.380 --> 48:35.580
that determine the size and the shape and the scaling.

48:35.580 --> 48:37.220
It's not enough to know what the transduction

48:37.220 --> 48:38.980
looks like on the single cell.

48:38.980 --> 48:41.820
And what's the, oh, what's it doing in adults?

48:41.820 --> 48:46.100
I think what it's doing in adults is morphostasis.

48:46.100 --> 48:47.700
So it's keeping you together

48:47.700 --> 48:51.940
against individual cell senescence and turnover.

48:51.940 --> 48:55.260
So usually what it's, and by the way,

48:55.260 --> 48:57.780
the interface between bioelectricity and aging

48:57.780 --> 48:59.140
is not well understood at all.

48:59.140 --> 49:00.340
No one has studied it, right?

49:00.340 --> 49:01.700
We haven't even touched it.

49:01.700 --> 49:03.580
So it's not as if we know what the answer is,

49:03.580 --> 49:06.540
but basically I think probably what it's doing

49:06.540 --> 49:10.340
is it's just cancer suppression and morphostasis

49:10.340 --> 49:11.940
and keeping your tissues together.

49:11.940 --> 49:14.340
And it's really activating those very dynamic

49:15.340 --> 49:17.620
morphogenetic rearrangement modules

49:17.620 --> 49:20.020
that is needed to really sort of rejuvenate

49:20.020 --> 49:21.380
and restore after injury.

49:24.860 --> 49:25.820
Are you satisfied?

49:25.820 --> 49:26.780
Okay, lovely.

49:26.780 --> 49:28.780
Glad you snuck three questions and Carl.

49:28.780 --> 49:30.580
Okay, next one up, we have one out.

49:36.700 --> 49:37.540
You do?

49:37.540 --> 49:38.380
Okay.

49:40.620 --> 49:41.460
Fascinating stuff.

49:41.460 --> 49:44.340
So what is the, what controls the appearance

49:44.340 --> 49:46.900
of these electrical zones?

49:46.900 --> 49:50.100
What determines their dispersal as well?

49:51.300 --> 49:56.300
Yeah, so there's two important pieces to this.

49:56.660 --> 49:59.500
One important piece is what underlies the hardware itself.

49:59.500 --> 50:00.620
And so you have to ask,

50:00.620 --> 50:02.980
in order to have any kind of electrical states,

50:02.980 --> 50:05.660
you have to have the correct ion channels

50:05.700 --> 50:07.380
that are capable of producing them.

50:07.380 --> 50:09.980
So one thing that you need to understand

50:09.980 --> 50:12.100
is what channels are there and what are their properties?

50:12.100 --> 50:14.660
So for example, they might themselves be voltage sensitive

50:14.660 --> 50:16.300
or they might be pH gated or whatever,

50:16.300 --> 50:21.060
and this controls the properties of these channels

50:21.060 --> 50:26.060
are the excitable medium on which these electrical phenomena

50:28.060 --> 50:28.900
propagate.

50:28.900 --> 50:31.140
Now the specific patterns,

50:31.140 --> 50:34.140
let's say that electric face pattern is,

50:34.140 --> 50:36.340
it's an emergent pattern in the same way

50:36.340 --> 50:41.340
that Turing patterns emerge from an excitable chemical medium

50:41.460 --> 50:45.220
or the way that when we talk about this with my students,

50:45.220 --> 50:47.180
I start off and I say visualize,

50:47.180 --> 50:49.020
you have a collection of electric parts

50:49.020 --> 50:52.140
that make a calculator and when you turn it on,

50:52.140 --> 50:53.780
it has a default behavior, right?

50:53.780 --> 50:55.860
That the parts were chosen

50:55.860 --> 50:58.820
so that when a juice is turned on and the thing is running,

50:58.820 --> 51:03.820
it will by default start off at a consistent baseline

51:04.340 --> 51:05.740
emergent state, which is zero.

51:05.740 --> 51:08.220
Now, past that, it has interesting properties

51:08.220 --> 51:12.060
of reprogrammability and all kinds of other things it can do,

51:12.060 --> 51:14.980
but there's this basic state that the parts

51:14.980 --> 51:16.460
which are shaped by evolution,

51:17.700 --> 51:19.060
there's an emergent pattern

51:19.060 --> 51:20.780
and we can study that symmetry breaking.

51:20.780 --> 51:22.220
So it's a process of symmetry breaking

51:22.220 --> 51:24.940
of amplification of long range inhibition,

51:24.940 --> 51:27.180
short range activation that sets up,

51:27.180 --> 51:29.220
it sets up exactly two eye spots

51:29.220 --> 51:31.060
at a particular distance apart.

51:31.060 --> 51:32.960
All of these things can be modeled.

51:35.140 --> 51:36.860
Okay.

51:36.860 --> 51:38.300
Are you satisfied, Donald?

51:38.300 --> 51:39.660
Yes, okay, great.

51:39.660 --> 51:41.220
We'll do it.

51:41.220 --> 51:42.380
Lovely, great.

51:42.380 --> 51:43.620
Next up, we have Josh.

51:46.380 --> 51:47.940
Hey, thanks again for the talk.

51:47.940 --> 51:49.940
That was like super interesting.

51:49.940 --> 51:52.980
My question was for the worms to put planaria,

51:52.980 --> 51:55.140
is that how you pronounce it?

51:55.140 --> 51:56.660
If you chop, you mentioned that they could have

51:56.660 --> 51:58.380
like learned behaviors.

51:58.380 --> 52:00.060
I was curious if like the worms chopped

52:00.060 --> 52:02.740
with multiple pieces, once those pieces grow,

52:02.740 --> 52:05.580
if all the pieces retain those learned behaviors

52:05.580 --> 52:07.140
of like the original worm?

52:07.140 --> 52:08.780
Yeah, that's a great question.

52:08.780 --> 52:12.020
It was addressed first in the 60s by a guy named McConnell

52:12.020 --> 52:15.620
and he published his observations that in fact they do.

52:15.620 --> 52:18.060
So you can take a worm and you can train

52:18.060 --> 52:20.300
on a particular task, chop off the tail,

52:20.300 --> 52:22.060
raise a new worm from that tail.

52:22.060 --> 52:27.060
So we in 2013, we reproduced all that aspect

52:27.420 --> 52:28.380
of his work, he did other stuff,

52:28.380 --> 52:30.900
but that's what we reproduced and it's true, they do.

52:30.900 --> 52:33.100
So what that's telling you is that

52:33.100 --> 52:36.380
even learned sort of behavioral information,

52:36.380 --> 52:38.100
not just morphological information,

52:38.100 --> 52:42.980
is stored outside the brain in some form

52:42.980 --> 52:46.260
and is able to be imprinted on the new brain as it forms.

52:46.260 --> 52:47.100
It's pretty remarkable

52:47.100 --> 52:48.260
because that tail doesn't do anything

52:48.260 --> 52:49.420
until the new brain forms, right?

52:49.420 --> 52:50.540
So it grows a new brain

52:50.540 --> 52:52.700
and then the information is somehow imprinted.

52:52.700 --> 52:54.980
So what you're seeing is learned information

52:54.980 --> 52:56.340
moving around within the body.

52:56.340 --> 52:59.060
Super interesting, not well understood at all.

52:59.060 --> 53:00.700
Cool.

53:00.700 --> 53:03.620
Wow, okay, Ashish is next.

53:05.060 --> 53:06.780
Hi, Michael, very nice talk.

53:06.780 --> 53:07.620
Thank you.

53:07.620 --> 53:10.020
I wanted to ask which intervention tools

53:10.020 --> 53:12.820
are available right now for mainly

53:12.820 --> 53:14.740
for the regenerative medicine purposes?

53:14.740 --> 53:16.700
Is it mainly ion channel genes

53:16.700 --> 53:19.620
or something else also available?

53:19.620 --> 53:23.540
Yeah, the tools, I mean, as I see it,

53:23.540 --> 53:25.820
the best tools are the ion channel drugs.

53:25.820 --> 53:28.300
I mean, in model systems at the bench,

53:28.300 --> 53:32.380
ion channel genes are useful

53:32.380 --> 53:33.820
because they give you the cleanest,

53:33.820 --> 53:34.980
the genetic technologies,

53:34.980 --> 53:37.260
like the cleanest for getting pathway information.

53:37.260 --> 53:39.540
But I think in medical application,

53:39.540 --> 53:41.540
you don't want to have to do gene therapy

53:41.540 --> 53:44.780
every time you want to target these pathways

53:44.780 --> 53:45.740
and you don't have to

53:45.740 --> 53:47.780
because I think we've had great success

53:47.780 --> 53:51.500
using drugs together with the computational model.

53:51.500 --> 53:52.860
That's the key, you need both.

53:52.860 --> 53:55.660
You need the available toolkit of drugs

53:55.660 --> 53:57.900
that target all of these ion channels.

53:57.900 --> 53:59.500
And then you need the computational model

53:59.500 --> 54:01.700
to tell you which channels to turn on and off

54:01.700 --> 54:04.140
and when to get the correct outcome.

54:04.140 --> 54:06.540
And so I see that as the most important tool to get right now.

54:06.540 --> 54:08.820
It's the collection of channel drugs.

54:08.820 --> 54:10.380
All right, thank you very much.

54:11.860 --> 54:14.820
Lovely, we have Martin next.

54:14.820 --> 54:17.700
Hi, is there a relationship

54:17.700 --> 54:22.540
between endogenous peptide-based ionophores

54:22.540 --> 54:24.460
and the ionophores you're using?

54:25.460 --> 54:29.700
We have used, so the vast majority of our work

54:29.700 --> 54:30.900
is not with ionophores.

54:30.900 --> 54:32.660
We've done a little bit with ionophores.

54:32.660 --> 54:35.660
The main ionophore we've used is monensin

54:35.660 --> 54:38.420
and we've also used a couple other things.

54:38.420 --> 54:40.380
But I'm sure there are others.

54:40.380 --> 54:43.060
I mean, I don't know about the peptide-based ones.

54:43.060 --> 54:45.340
So maybe we should have a conversation offline

54:45.340 --> 54:47.540
so that I could learn more about them.

54:47.540 --> 54:50.340
But we've used things like monensin basically.

54:51.420 --> 54:53.980
Yeah, but the majority of things we use are not,

54:53.980 --> 54:56.220
the ionophores are really kind of a sledgehammer

54:56.220 --> 54:57.260
in many ways.

54:57.260 --> 55:00.540
We tend to use very specific ion channel drugs

55:00.540 --> 55:03.500
that hit classes of different kinds of channels.

55:04.820 --> 55:05.660
Thank you.

55:06.660 --> 55:09.500
Thanks, next one up we have Alan.

55:21.620 --> 55:23.220
I can also ask you a question

55:23.260 --> 55:24.940
in case you're talking about muting.

55:24.940 --> 55:28.580
She's just asking, what is the cocktail that includes DPCA?

55:29.500 --> 55:32.140
Is this Ellen Heberkatz, is that right?

55:32.140 --> 55:35.900
Oh, hey, Ellen, it's been a while, I have a long time no see.

55:35.900 --> 55:39.860
Yeah, so there's a variety of cocktails.

55:39.860 --> 55:42.660
The earliest cocktail wasn't even a cocktail,

55:42.660 --> 55:43.900
it was extremely simple.

55:43.900 --> 55:46.820
It was just monensin.

55:46.820 --> 55:50.860
We had one after that that had progesterone

55:50.860 --> 55:52.380
and things like that.

55:52.380 --> 55:56.580
We are playing with DPCA, stay tuned.

55:57.780 --> 55:58.980
Among many other things,

55:58.980 --> 56:02.300
the current cocktail has five different ingredients

56:02.300 --> 56:05.540
and that paper should be out in a matter of weeks.

56:05.540 --> 56:07.100
So you'll see the cocktail,

56:07.100 --> 56:09.740
you'll see all the dosages and everything else.

56:11.900 --> 56:13.980
Okay, lovely, next one up, Anton.

56:15.460 --> 56:20.460
Hello, so I was really impressed by your in vivo results

56:21.460 --> 56:24.820
with fog limber generation,

56:24.820 --> 56:29.660
but I actually have a question regarding in vitro application,

56:29.660 --> 56:34.660
like can your drug cocktails and similar interventions

56:35.500 --> 56:38.740
be used for suspension culture

56:38.740 --> 56:42.100
to grow some vascularized organoids

56:42.100 --> 56:47.100
or some vascularized muscle tissues for clean meat application

56:47.500 --> 56:52.500
or for in vitro we have to do something quite different?

56:54.140 --> 56:55.380
Yeah, great question.

56:55.380 --> 56:57.540
So I think absolutely they can.

56:57.540 --> 56:59.740
We've not done that particular thing.

56:59.740 --> 57:02.660
What we have done with David Kaplan's group

57:02.660 --> 57:06.820
and some others is we've done in vitro with cell culture.

57:06.820 --> 57:10.540
So mammalian human cell culture, it absolutely works.

57:10.540 --> 57:12.940
So you can keep stem cells more stem-like,

57:12.940 --> 57:15.260
you can force stem cells to differentiate.

57:15.260 --> 57:16.500
You can do those kinds of things

57:16.540 --> 57:18.620
exactly the same methods.

57:18.620 --> 57:22.620
I think absolutely they would work in organoids.

57:22.620 --> 57:26.780
We are currently using them in our synthetic bio-bots

57:26.780 --> 57:29.940
which are sort of, it's like organoids one step further

57:29.940 --> 57:32.180
which they have organoids with behavior.

57:32.180 --> 57:34.020
So they move around, they do various things

57:34.020 --> 57:35.660
and that's what we're doing.

57:35.660 --> 57:38.820
But I would love to, if that's something you work on,

57:38.820 --> 57:40.420
drop me an email and let's talk about it

57:40.420 --> 57:43.500
because yeah, that's an open area of application

57:43.500 --> 57:45.700
that just nobody's gotten to it yet.

57:45.700 --> 57:48.540
Oh yeah, we work a bit, I will drop an email.

57:48.540 --> 57:50.420
Sure, drop me an email, yeah.

57:50.420 --> 57:51.740
Thank you.

57:51.740 --> 57:53.260
Vadim is up next.

57:54.940 --> 57:56.260
Thank you.

57:56.260 --> 57:59.260
Yeah, the answer to my question probably is not known

57:59.260 --> 58:02.700
but Michael, based on what, I mean,

58:02.700 --> 58:05.580
based on your understanding of the regeneration process

58:05.580 --> 58:07.460
in your systems, what do you think

58:08.340 --> 58:11.500
would be a biological age of the regenerated tissues?

58:11.500 --> 58:13.140
Would it be younger or the same age

58:13.140 --> 58:15.780
of the rest of the animal will be older?

58:15.780 --> 58:17.020
Great question.

58:17.020 --> 58:18.260
I don't know the answer to that.

58:18.260 --> 58:20.220
We have been working with,

58:22.380 --> 58:27.060
so Steve Hoverarth is making this methylation clock

58:27.060 --> 58:29.540
for various organisms and we're waiting

58:29.540 --> 58:33.460
till he calibrates the frog one and then we can see.

58:34.980 --> 58:36.980
That would be the easiest way to do it right now.

58:36.980 --> 58:38.780
If you have some other markers,

58:38.780 --> 58:40.900
I'd love to hear about it but we don't know.

58:40.900 --> 58:42.420
Actually, we are doing this together

58:42.500 --> 58:43.820
and we're waiting for this him for the frog.

58:43.820 --> 58:44.660
Oh, well, there you go.

58:44.660 --> 58:45.500
I said, okay, great.

58:45.500 --> 58:48.220
So, okay, so we'll, you know, as soon as you guys are ready,

58:48.220 --> 58:50.460
we'll, we can check it out.

58:50.460 --> 58:55.460
And maybe, you know, once we get the mice working,

58:56.220 --> 58:58.900
then we can check, I mean, that should be much easier.

58:58.900 --> 59:00.340
Once we get the mice working,

59:00.340 --> 59:03.060
we can see what the mouse tissues look like.

59:03.060 --> 59:04.660
That stuff is still in progress.

59:05.940 --> 59:07.220
Fantastic, okay.

59:07.220 --> 59:09.180
Then next one up, let's take one

59:09.180 --> 59:11.460
who hasn't asked the question, Thomas Schwirder.

59:12.780 --> 59:15.140
Yeah, hi, fantastic talk.

59:15.140 --> 59:17.860
So I have a question basically about an example

59:17.860 --> 59:19.100
that you mentioned sort of in passing,

59:19.100 --> 59:24.100
which is the fact that in like deer antlers grow at rates

59:24.540 --> 59:26.540
on the order of centimeters per day.

59:26.540 --> 59:28.420
Now, you mentioned in the flatworms

59:28.420 --> 59:30.340
that you were able to sort of activate

59:32.740 --> 59:36.260
processes that happen in certain species

59:36.260 --> 59:38.580
in flatworms that are of other species.

59:38.580 --> 59:40.660
And what I'm wondering is whether you think

59:40.660 --> 59:43.020
it might be possible to use bioelectrical signaling

59:43.020 --> 59:47.140
to trigger bone regrowth on that same sort of order.

59:49.060 --> 59:51.260
Yeah, in kind of the same way.

59:51.260 --> 59:54.660
Yeah, I mean, optimistically, I think so.

59:54.660 --> 59:56.260
I, you know, it's entirely possible

59:56.260 --> 59:59.980
that we will run into some weird aspect of deer physiology

59:59.980 --> 01:00:02.100
that permits it, whereas for humans, it wouldn't work.

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:03.740
I can't say that that doesn't exist.

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.700
We don't know, but I don't think so.

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:10.500
I think that, I think these are all very fundamental things

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:13.020
and I can tell you some speculative stories

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.980
about why I think humans normally don't do this kind of stuff.

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.940
But I think it's there to be unlocked.

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:20.980
I doubt it's gonna be a deer-specific issue, yeah.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:23.140
Thank you.

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:24.620
Oh, lots of work to be done.

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.700
Brad English.

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:30.780
Yeah, you mentioned me.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.700
Sorry, you're breaking up.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:35.540
I can't hear.

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.140
General pathways that you,

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.340
maybe someone else can ask about the internet issue for me.

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:41.940
My question's in the chat.

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:45.500
Okay, have you tried sitting a plate of cells

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:48.220
atop a conductive plate with a certain pattern

01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:50.780
to see if you could guide its development?

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.500
Sorry, what do you mean by a conductive,

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.260
but what's a conductive plate?

01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:57.660
Like with a voltage or current running through it to change,

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.620
what would, yeah, the underlying firmware.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:02.940
Yeah, got it, got it.

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:05.940
You can, okay, so generally speaking,

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:10.540
using external electrical signals,

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:13.500
like using electrodes basically,

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:17.060
is you can do certain things that way.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.260
So one thing you can do that way

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:22.060
is provide a vector for cell migration.

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:22.900
So that's an easy way.

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:24.460
If you have migratory cell types,

01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:26.540
that is a great way to get them all moving

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:28.220
in one particular direction.

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:32.140
What's very hard using external electrodes

01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:36.020
is to set up standing patterns of voltage across tissue,

01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.460
which is what the encoding really is.

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:41.620
The bioelectrical code is really spatial patterns

01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:44.700
of voltage differences across a field of cells.

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:48.100
That's actually very difficult to do with electrodes.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.660
But if you want to do things like move cells around,

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:54.420
that you can do with external currents.

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:56.220
Okay, so you might have to go as small

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:58.340
as like magnetic nanoparticles or something,

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.100
folding around to produce something more interesting

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:02.540
or sit with the chemicals.

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.060
But yeah, I see your point and you're right.

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:05.860
It's a mesoscopic at that point.

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:08.460
Yeah, I mean, but the tools are already here.

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:11.340
So I mean, if we want to set up a pattern

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:14.860
that encodes the correct size and shape of the brain,

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:16.340
which is not a simple pattern,

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:19.060
we can already do that with drugs.

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.820
And if you want a more complex pattern,

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.780
I think what you would do is optogenetics.

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:25.100
So you would lay down a light mask

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.060
that had the exact shape that you want

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.460
and your tissue would have on our channel eruptions

01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:30.300
or something like that.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:34.860
And we've done that for kickstarting tail regeneration

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:35.700
and things like that.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:39.820
I think right now, that's the easier path for this.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:42.100
Fascinating, thank you so much, Michael.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:43.260
Bleeding edge stuff.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.600
Cool, thanks.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.500
We have Artem and then Carl.

01:02:49.860 --> 01:02:50.700
Hi there.

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:56.660
Just earlier to Ashish and the Brett's question just now,

01:02:56.660 --> 01:03:01.260
I think more operational than a senescence question,

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:05.740
but yeah, is there anything you think

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:10.740
that could be brought from a computer science background

01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:16.060
from adjacent fields like microscopy or NGS sequencing

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.020
to enrich the stool kit that you mentioned,

01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:26.940
both using the drugs to alter the ion channels

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:32.140
and to get access to more of the morphospace, let's say.

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.500
Sure, yeah, absolutely.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:39.140
I mean, on the microscopy and better dyes

01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:41.940
and better imaging of bioelectric states

01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:44.460
in under various conditions is really important.

01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:47.180
So nobody's done the basic profiling.

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:48.620
So like physiomic profiling

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:52.460
I'm asking every normal organ in its normal structure,

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:54.740
what is the bioelectric map, right?

01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:55.580
No one's done that.

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.660
I mean, we've done it in very specific cases

01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.620
for some frogs and worms and things like this,

01:03:59.620 --> 01:04:02.660
but in general, that data is extremely sparse.

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:06.860
So lots more imaging using better dyes

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:07.940
that need to be developed

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:11.760
and just getting those physiomic data sets

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.100
to complement the transcriptomic

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.900
and the genomic data sets is critical.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.780
For NGS, yeah, NGS is good.

01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:22.540
I feel like we already have most of the NGS that we need

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:25.260
because almost any tissue, what do we wanna know?

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:26.580
We wanna know which channels are there

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.140
because those are our control knobs.

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:31.340
So pretty much any tissue you can go online

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:34.020
and you can download somebody's profiling

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:36.580
and you can figure out what channels are there.

01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:39.180
So that's probably not the rate limiting step

01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:41.020
but the microscopy for sure, yeah.

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.140
Wow, okay, now Carl, you go again.

01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:50.100
So outside of the sort of translational aspect here

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:52.380
of getting things to regenerate

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.980
or fixing problems in the process,

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:59.100
how many labs in the world are studying the basic,

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:00.780
get us more information about this?

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:02.340
Questions, like you mentioned

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:03.580
that there's not a whole lot of work

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.860
understanding the aging aspect of this.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:09.220
Like, what changes about the nine to 11 year olds

01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:10.640
or whatever that makes their fingertips

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:11.900
not regenerate versus before?

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.740
What's different about the bioelectronite resource

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:16.140
or what's involved in human liver regeneration

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:19.220
to those networks change over time, things like that?

01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:21.740
And the question Allison asks at the end,

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:23.220
which maybe she was still saving

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:24.460
is what can this group do for you?

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:26.820
So maybe in relation to that question,

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:31.260
are you doing anything to encourage research labs

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:34.580
that focus on aging to nudge in this direction?

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:39.580
Yeah, so overall, definitely there are not that many labs.

01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:43.180
It's still relatively speaking a small field.

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:47.260
There are people who work in bioelectricity

01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:48.940
and don't know they work in bioelectricity.

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:51.820
And what I mean by that is people who, for example,

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:53.860
if you study Anderson-Taywell syndrome, right?

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:54.780
And you're a geneticist

01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:55.980
and you don't care about bioelectricity,

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.820
but you care about Anderson-Taywell syndrome.

01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:58.940
And then eventually you sequence

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:01.020
and you find out that, whoa, it's a potassium channel.

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.740
Why do my potassium channel patients

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:04.380
have craniofacial dysmorphias?

01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:06.540
Well, now you're working in developmental bioelectricity,

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:10.100
so there are some folks that sort of get dragged

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:14.380
into it that way, but labs that really focus on this,

01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:17.260
there aren't that many, there really aren't that many.

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:20.460
And in particular, getting money for profiling

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:21.660
is almost impossible, right?

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:24.020
If you're lucky, if you can from standard sources

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:25.660
and IH and so on, you're lucky

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:27.660
if you can get funding for functional data,

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:31.220
like I'm going to figure out what these ion channels do

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.700
in drosophila development or something like this,

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:37.100
you can do that, but getting money

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:40.380
for a comprehensive profiling project,

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:44.660
the way that they do in, when they have these,

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:46.700
let's figure out what every cell in the brain

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:47.620
is expressing, right?

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:51.460
And the Allen brain atlas and these kinds of things,

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.340
getting funding for that is almost impossible,

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:57.100
so no one's done it.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.740
As far as your last question,

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:02.540
yeah, I mean, I would love to get into aging,

01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:05.580
I'd love to collaborate with anybody in this community.

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:08.180
Generally speaking, what we've been doing for years now

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:10.860
to try and lower the barrier for other people to get in

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.620
is that we publish a lot of reviews

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:15.420
and a lot of how-to protocols.

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:17.780
So we put everything online as far as if you wanted

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:19.860
to get into this from whatever system,

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:21.060
whatever you're interested in,

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:24.500
here is like literally step A, B, C,

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.380
how, what do you do next, right?

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.980
And so we send out gift baskets of reagents,

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:33.980
we provide all the plasmids, the dye protocols,

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.100
all the data interpretation stuff,

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.060
we all have that as out there.

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:39.180
So anybody that's interested,

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.180
I would be more than happy to help you guys do this.

01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:43.020
It'd be great.

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:45.700
Fantastic, thank you.

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:49.140
And well, you also mentioned there's a company, right?

01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:52.460
And would you make clear quickly at the beginning of the talk?

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:54.300
And so what's happening with that next?

01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:56.380
What are your next steps in this arena?

01:07:56.380 --> 01:08:00.420
Yeah, it's basically the company is,

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:05.340
the initial focus is quite narrow, it's limb regeneration.

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:08.020
And so what we're doing is we're testing our various cocktails

01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:11.540
in mice using David Kaplan's wearable bioreactor,

01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:14.540
short-term application, our ion channel cocktail,

01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:17.140
can we trigger limb regeneration?

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:18.380
That's the beginning.

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:23.380
Obviously my dream is to grow this to a kind of fundamental

01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:28.260
approach to picking electroseuticals

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:31.020
for all sorts of indications from birth defects

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:34.060
to regenerative medicine to aging to cancer.

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:36.860
But right now it's just about limb regeneration.

01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:41.260
Okay, and anything people in this group could do there

01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:42.620
to help, like are you looking for collaborators

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.340
with that company or like investors

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.980
or is there anything, what are our next steps?

01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:51.980
Sure, we're certainly happy to hear from investors.

01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:54.780
For sure, anybody that wants to collaborate,

01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:56.620
drop me an email and let me know what you do

01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:59.380
and we'll see what makes sense.

01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:01.780
Yeah, our lab is very collaborative,

01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:02.860
we work with all kinds of people.

01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:05.580
So for sure, I'd love to hear from this community.

01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:08.580
Great, well, it seems like you're already collaborating,

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:12.940
at least with Vadim, be known around Cornus.

01:09:12.940 --> 01:09:14.540
One final thing, which is,

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:17.220
we ask people to submit a longevity channel challenge,

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:18.220
which you've done.

01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:20.260
And this is just another pack

01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:21.980
that people can answer this challenge

01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:24.980
and actually, again, up to $250 doing.

01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:27.100
So do you want to say maybe a few words

01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:29.860
about the challenge that you submitted?

01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:32.660
Yeah, well, I mean, so I wasn't really familiar

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:35.980
with how all this works, but basically,

01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:38.380
the big challenge in this field that I see

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:41.660
is just what I think, let's put it this way,

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:45.220
what I think would make a real breakthrough

01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:47.860
and move the field forward, kind of a watershed effect,

01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:51.580
would be the ability to really image

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:52.780
these bioelectric states

01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:55.020
in all sorts of important conditions.

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.140
And not because imaging by itself,

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.540
I really focus on functional experiments.

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.460
I mean, seeing the beautiful patterns is nice,

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.620
but more importantly, are they instructive, right?

01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:05.700
Can I show that when you alter the pattern,

01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:07.700
the gene expression changes and the anatomy changes,

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.540
and we do that.

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:09.820
And so that's what my lab is focused on.

01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:12.140
But it would certainly make it much easier

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:15.060
to develop those kind of functional approaches

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:18.620
if we had the baseline data from other model systems,

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:20.940
other conditions, various disease conditions,

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:23.740
various human organs, this would be a real game changer.

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:26.140
So that's what I plan.
