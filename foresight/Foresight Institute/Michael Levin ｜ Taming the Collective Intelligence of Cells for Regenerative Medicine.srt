00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Welcome, everyone, to Forsyth's Biotech and Health Extension

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,960
Group, sponsored by 100 Plus Capital.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,440
I'm so filled to have Michael Levine here today.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,160
He was recommended by someone whose recommendations

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,200
I hold very highly.

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,680
So I'm terribly excited for your talk.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,600
I think you're tying together a variety

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,360
of different super interesting fields.

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,240
You're definitely, I think, pushing the envelope

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,200
with the research that you do.

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,960
I will say no more and let you guys

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,760
the conversation.

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,600
We'll have a little break halfway through,

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,240
in which we'll have a few announcements

15
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,280
from people in the community, and then

16
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,640
we'll go for a longer discussion.

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,440
I think Michael already said he can stay a little longer.

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,760
But this is just a reminder from me on the beginning

19
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,280
that I will, in a second, prompt you in the chat

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,880
to ask questions.

21
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,920
And usually what happens at the end of these talks

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,080
is that we have lots of questions and not the time

23
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,120
to cover them all.

24
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,960
So don't be shy.

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,760
Ask them early.

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,960
Then we can start uploading, downloading questions.

27
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,120
Because usually at the end of it, we always

28
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,280
try to keep them as short as possible.

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,880
But why not start early with asking questions?

30
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,280
So thank you so, so, so much for joining today.

31
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,680
And Michael, it's really a pleasure to finally have you on.

32
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,640
We scheduled this a while back already.

33
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,840
And you're going to tell us lots of things

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,200
about regenerative medicine that I think

35
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,160
many people here don't even have on the radar yet at all.

36
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,360
You're leading the Taft Center for Regenerative

37
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,760
and Developmental Biology.

38
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,920
I will post more on your bio in the chat.

39
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,240
For now, please take it away.

40
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,760
I'm really thrilled to have you here.

41
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,600
And thank you for joining.

42
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,640
Thank you so much.

43
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,760
And yeah, thank you for having me and for the opportunity

44
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,880
to speak to you all about this.

45
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,280
So let's see, can everybody see my slide?

46
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,960
Yeah, perfect.

47
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,520
OK, so you see here two websites.

48
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,800
Please feel free to get in touch with me afterwards

49
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,680
if you have any questions that we don't cover.

50
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,480
Everything is there, all the primary papers

51
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,160
and everything else is there.

52
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,840
And I have to do a disclosure.

53
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,120
I have a spin-off company called Morphosuticals Inc.

54
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,000
with David Kaplan.

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,880
And I'll tell you a little bit more about that.

56
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,160
So I want to give the main point of the talk right up front.

57
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,800
And here are the four things that I'm

58
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,680
going to try to transmit today.

59
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,600
I think that solving the problem of anatomical homeostasis,

60
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,000
which I will discuss, is the key to really transformative

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,120
regenerative medicine, which will address aging

62
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,320
as well as many other things.

63
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,520
And that the current approaches focusing

64
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,400
on stem cell biology, genomic editing, things like this

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,520
are limited by themselves.

66
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,640
And that what is really, really key

67
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,040
is to understand the software of life.

68
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,960
And I'll show you some examples of that.

69
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,640
A key medium by which cells compute and make decisions

70
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,440
in vivo is what we call non-neural bioelectricity.

71
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,560
And it now turns out that we have learned to read and write

72
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,520
various goal states into the collective intelligence

73
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,200
of tissues.

74
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,920
And I'll show you some examples of that.

75
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,680
And I think fundamentally that cracking

76
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,400
this bioelectric code, which is a sort of evolutionary precursor

77
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,040
to the electric code that our brains use,

78
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,360
will enable a really profound new class of electroseuticals

79
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,000
with lots of new applications in birth defects,

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,320
regenerative medicine, cancer, aging,

81
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,880
and synthetic bioengineering.

82
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,440
So those are my main points.

83
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,120
If we boil down the whole talk to one sentence,

84
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,000
what I'm here to tell you is that, like the brain,

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,640
all of your body cells and tissues make decisions.

86
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,720
And these are decisions about structure and function.

87
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,760
And that we can now, we have the techniques

88
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,560
to actually read the information processing that

89
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,800
goes into those decisions and actually modify it rationally.

90
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,560
And what you see here is one of our five-legged frogs.

91
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,080
And this is my reminder to tell you

92
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,160
that you're going to see all kinds of weird-looking creatures

93
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,560
today.

94
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,880
And that is not Photoshop.

95
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,040
These are actual real animals that we produce as a means

96
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,400
of testing our theories of where shape comes from

97
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,720
and how to control.

98
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,760
So let's talk first about some fundamental knowledge gaps.

99
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,000
I want to highlight what it is that we don't know,

100
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,400
despite all of our amazing advances in molecular biology.

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,760
So what we would like to have is something

102
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,480
we call the anatomical compiler.

103
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,280
The idea is that someday you should

104
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,080
be able to sit down at a computer

105
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,440
and draw the animal or plant that you would like to have.

106
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,920
So not try to create a bottom up from a description of pathways.

107
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,640
You shouldn't need to think about pathways.

108
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,960
You should be able to, like we do for computer-aided design,

109
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,240
when the field is mature, you should

110
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,480
be able to sit down and say, I want a three-headed flatworm

111
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,400
with a shape that roughly looks like this.

112
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,600
And what the compiler would do is convert that anatomical

113
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,280
description into the set of stimuli

114
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,720
that have to be given to those cells to produce whatever

115
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,120
it is that you ask for.

116
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,920
That's the end game for this field.

117
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,200
It's complete and total control of morphology.

118
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,240
And it might be a liver, and it might be a heart,

119
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,320
and it might be a whole organism,

120
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,040
or it might be something that's never existed on Earth before.

121
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,000
It shouldn't matter.

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,840
We should be able to take a description of the anatomy

123
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,560
that we want and to figure out what stimuli would

124
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,040
have to be given to cells to be able to produce it.

125
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,560
And the critical thing is that if we could do this,

126
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,200
we would immediately have all the answers to birth defects,

127
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,040
to regenerating lost or damaged organs,

128
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,040
to the defection from the body plan known as cancer,

129
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,840
to aging, to all of these challenges

130
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,760
to the normal healthy morphology of a body.

131
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,960
And so this is fundamentally a problem of information

132
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,040
processing, as I will argue.

133
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,160
And so the question is, why don't we have this yet?

134
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,640
Genomics has proceeded very rapidly.

135
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,760
Why do we not have this?

136
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,280
Because, of course, we don't have anything remotely like this.

137
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Our control over anatomy is still extremely poor.

138
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,840
And so the reason is because there

139
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,880
are fundamental gaps in our understanding.

140
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
And I'll just give you a very simple example.

141
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,200
So here on the left, you see an axolotl.

142
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,960
And axolotl larvae have legs.

143
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,680
And on the right, you see a frog larva.

144
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,240
And frog larvae do not have legs.

145
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,760
The tadpoles don't have legs.

146
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,440
And one can do a thought experiment

147
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,960
and say that, well, at the early embryonic stage,

148
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,120
I'm going to take 50% of the axolotl embryo,

149
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,480
50% of the frog embryo, I'm going to mix them up,

150
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,120
and I'm going to make a frog allotl.

151
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,120
And it turns out the cells do perfectly fine.

152
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,560
They actually do work together.

153
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,480
But now I ask you a simple question.

154
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,640
Will the frog allotl have legs?

155
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,040
You have access to both genomes.

156
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,600
You have access to the axolotl genome.

157
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,280
You have access to the frog genome.

158
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,840
Will the frog allotl have legs?

159
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,880
And if so, will the legs be made entirely of axolotl cells?

160
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,480
Or will they recruit the frog cells?

161
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,920
The point is we have no idea.

162
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,800
And until we do the experiment, of course, right?

163
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,080
So even having the genomic sequence,

164
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,160
these basic fundamental questions

165
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,080
about what shape is going to result

166
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,640
are something that we cannot yet answer.

167
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,560
And that really holds back regenerative medicine.

168
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,840
And so let's just ask the fundamental question,

169
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,360
where does shape come from?

170
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,200
And so we all start life as this sort of ball

171
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,560
of embryonic blastomers.

172
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,920
And then here you see a cross-section

173
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,160
through the human torso.

174
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,600
So look at this incredible arrangement.

175
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,120
All the organs are in exactly the right place,

176
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,040
orientation, size, position relative to each other.

177
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,560
Where does all this come from?

178
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,240
And if you might be tempted to say the genome,

179
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,560
and so the genome certainly produces

180
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,920
the cellular hardware that you need to create this.

181
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,400
So the genome gives you all the protein sequences,

182
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,280
but the genome doesn't directly say anything

183
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,720
about this kind of order.

184
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,240
It's simply not there in that way.

185
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,160
And so we really need to understand

186
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,280
how do cell groups know what to make and when to stop, right?

187
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,600
It's a collective, it's a collective intelligence problem

188
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,440
in the sense that all of these cells are active agents

189
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,920
that do various things.

190
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,400
And the result of their activity

191
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,200
is to self-assemble this amazing organism.

192
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,320
And as part of understanding this process,

193
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,920
we need to ask, first of all, in regenerative medicine,

194
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,960
if part of this is missing,

195
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,440
how do we convince the cells to rebuild it again?

196
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,800
And as engineers, we might ask, well, what else could we build?

197
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,280
Could we build something completely different

198
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,800
out of these same cells?

199
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,560
And so this central question

200
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,640
of where anatomical order comes from

201
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,840
and how do we control it is the key, I think,

202
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,400
to really profound changes in how we do medicine.

203
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,680
So the important thing is that single cells

204
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,120
are incredibly competent.

205
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,760
So here you have this creature is called the lacrimaria.

206
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,440
And you can see what it's doing, it's hunting,

207
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,000
it handles all of its physiological, its anatomical,

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,400
and its behavioral needs all in one cell.

209
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
There is no brain, there's no nervous system,

210
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,360
there are no stem cells,

211
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,800
there's no cell-to-cell communication, it's one cell.

212
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,600
And it's doing everything it needs

213
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,560
on the scale of one cell.

214
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,480
Now, when cells get together,

215
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,480
they actually scale up this ability

216
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,280
and they work on much bigger goals.

217
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,520
And these goals are the production

218
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,560
of complex invariant anatomy, such as these here.

219
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,560
And we know that simply differentiating stem cells

220
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,400
into particular tissue types is not sufficient

221
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,440
because then you can get something like this down here,

222
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,760
which is a teratoma.

223
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,680
So this is a tumor that might have skin and hair

224
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,920
and teeth and bone and muscle.

225
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,120
And the reason this is not a good embryo

226
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,440
is because it's missing that three-dimensional organization,

227
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,280
that structure.

228
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,600
All the stem cell differentiation proceeded fine.

229
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
You've got your cell types,

230
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,520
you've got your mature derivatives,

231
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,920
but they're not arranged in the correct place.

232
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,640
So it's not enough to have the building blocks,

233
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,880
you actually need to specify how they get together.

234
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,860
And so there's a kind of a mainstream paradigm

235
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,880
which thinks about a feed-forward emergent process

236
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,400
where you have gene regulatory networks

237
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,320
and these genes turn each other on and off,

238
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,080
they make proteins, some of these proteins

239
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,360
that are sticky or they exert force or they diffuse

240
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,200
and so on.

241
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,880
And as a result, there's this process

242
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,480
of what they call emergence.

243
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,560
And at the end, something really complex from top.

244
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,680
And the difficulty with this paradigm

245
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,600
for regenerative medicine is that

246
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,200
if you want to make changes here,

247
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,560
if you want to make repairs to the anatomy,

248
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,920
you have to somehow invert this chain

249
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,840
to figure out what are you going to do back here?

250
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,240
Which genes are you going to edit

251
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,520
and how in order to make complex anatomical changes?

252
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,160
And that inverse problem is fundamentally intractable.

253
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,600
It's extremely difficult.

254
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,520
And so this is basically what's holding

255
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,440
back regenerative medicine.

256
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,640
You simply don't know how to figure out

257
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,520
what changes to make at the very lowest levels

258
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,520
to give you the desired effects at the system level.

259
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,560
And so what we're very good at in the field

260
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,040
is figuring out things like this,

261
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,600
which genes and proteins control each other

262
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,920
and so on these pathways.

263
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,000
But what we really want to understand is this,

264
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,280
where do these different shapes come from

265
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,760
and what do we do when we want to alter

266
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,480
the rationally, okay.

267
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,600
So I should point out that it's not only

268
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,120
about creating a complex body during embryogenesis,

269
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,520
it's also about the amazing ability

270
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,600
of the cellular collectives to repair over time.

271
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,560
So here what you see here is an animal called an axolotl.

272
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,560
So this is a Mexican salamander.

273
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,440
These animals throughout their lifespan

274
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,720
regenerate their eyes, their limbs,

275
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,000
their ovaries, portions of their heart and brain

276
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,240
and their spinal cords.

277
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,600
So they will sort of bite off each other's legs

278
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,120
all the time and if you keep them in an aquarium

279
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,320
and the legs grow back.

280
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,000
And so here's what happens no matter where you amputate

281
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,960
or where they lose it along this axis,

282
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,080
they will do exactly the correct amount of growth

283
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,720
and patterning and then you have an indistinguishable limb

284
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,600
at the end.

285
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,000
And so what's remarkable about this

286
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
is not only that it rapidly grows

287
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,760
and creates the correct tissues

288
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,440
that actually stops at the right time.

289
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,760
The fact that regeneration stops is really amazing.

290
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,400
Think about it, when does it stop?

291
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,400
It stops when a correct salamander limb has formed.

292
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,040
And until then it has really rapid proliferation

293
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,000
and cell movement and changes in gene expression.

294
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,720
But all of that grinds to a halt

295
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,520
when a correct salamander limb has formed.

296
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,560
How does it know what a correct salamander limb is?

297
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,760
How does it know when to stop?

298
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,600
Because this is not simply a process

299
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,120
that always starts at the egg,

300
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,400
proceeds during a set of hardwired steps and then stops.

301
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,040
This is a flexible process that you can interrupt,

302
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,520
you can make changes, you can cut at any point

303
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,480
and it will pick up exactly at the right spot,

304
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,600
do what's needed and then stop when it's done.

305
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,000
So there's a degree of plasticity

306
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,060
and adaptive problem solving here.

307
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,540
So of course, axolotls are not the only creatures

308
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,940
that regenerate, so the human liver is regenerative

309
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,540
and even the ancient Greeks knew that,

310
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,140
I don't know how they knew that, but they did.

311
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,860
As you see here, deer are a large adult mammal

312
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,460
that every year regenerates huge amounts of bone

313
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,060
and skin and innervation and vasculature.

314
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,980
These antlers grow up to a rate of a centimeter

315
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,260
and a half per day.

316
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,300
Think about that, a centimeter and a half of new bone

317
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,860
per day is possible in mammals.

318
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,060
And even human children, usually below the age

319
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,780
of somewhere between seven and 11,

320
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,420
if they amputate their fingertips,

321
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,860
if you don't sew it over with skin,

322
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,900
but just sort of keep it clean, they will regenerate.

323
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,020
So even human children initially have some regenerability

324
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,260
to regenerate their fingers and then it goes away.

325
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,340
So these here are, I think, the champions of regeneration

326
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,820
and this should be a really motivational

327
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,020
and sort of aspirational animal for us all

328
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,540
who are interested in healthy lifespans.

329
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,860
This is a planarian.

330
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,180
These animals have a couple of interesting properties.

331
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,660
First of all, they're a complex animal

332
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,980
with a true brain and bilateral symmetry.

333
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,020
They're not like earthworms.

334
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,940
These are similar to our direct ancestor, okay?

335
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,700
They, first of all, have the ability of regeneration.

336
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,340
So you can cut them into any pieces along any plane.

337
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,500
The record is something like 276 pieces.

338
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,140
Every piece will regenerate exactly what's missing,

339
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,980
no more, no less,

340
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,900
and give you a perfect tiny little worm.

341
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,460
Every piece, they regenerate their brain,

342
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,740
every other organ.

343
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,540
Not only that, they're smart, so they can learn.

344
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,660
They have the ability to learn

345
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,820
in a variety of behavioral assays.

346
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,820
And best of all, they are immortal.

347
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,380
There is no such thing as an old planarian.

348
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,620
So individual cells senesce and fall off

349
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,380
and they regenerate whatever's missing

350
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,020
and they just keep on going.

351
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,900
And so what these guys are telling us

352
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,460
is that it is possible to be an immortal,

353
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,060
highly regenerative creature that also has intelligence.

354
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,100
This is not only for CNM and these and things like this.

355
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,700
You can actually be a bilaterian with a true brain,

356
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,300
all the same neurotransmitters that we have,

357
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,940
and be immortal, okay?

358
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,140
So this is a proof of principle right here,

359
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,660
an existence proof.

360
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,380
So one of the really important concepts

361
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,500
to try and understand how all this works

362
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,100
is really the idea of problem solving

363
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,020
by the collective intelligence of cells.

364
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,420
And I wanna show you just one example,

365
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,700
there are many examples, I wanna show you one example.

366
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,660
Here is a tadpole face and here's some eyes

367
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,260
and the brain and the nostrils.

368
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,020
And tadpoles need to become frogs.

369
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,060
And in order to become frogs, they rearrange their face.

370
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,460
So the nostrils have to move, the eyes have to move forward,

371
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,860
the jaws have to move, all these things have to move around.

372
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,700
And it used to be thought that somehow

373
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,420
what the genetics does is it gives you

374
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,700
a hardwired set of movements.

375
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,180
After all, all tadpoles look the same

376
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,100
and all frogs look the same.

377
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,860
So as long as everything moves in the right way,

378
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,300
you should get from a normal tadpole to a normal frog.

379
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,860
So what we did was we made so-called Picasso tadpoles

380
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,580
where everything is in the wrong place.

381
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,740
So the eyes are off kilter,

382
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,420
the nose is not where it's supposed to be,

383
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,700
the jaws are on the side of the head,

384
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,420
everything's not where it's supposed to be.

385
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,340
So when this happens, what we find is that

386
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,980
they still make largely normal frogs.

387
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,820
Why?

388
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,460
Because all of the different components

389
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,580
move around in novel paths, okay?

390
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,420
And in fact, sometimes they go too far

391
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,860
and have to back up and come back,

392
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,380
but they all move around

393
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,140
until they get pretty much to a normal frog face.

394
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,060
And this is remarkable.

395
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,060
This means that what the genetics actually gives you

396
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,340
is a machine that is able to minimize error,

397
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,580
that it has some internal representation

398
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,060
of what a correct frog face looks like.

399
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,260
And when you start it off in the wrong configuration,

400
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,420
something that never appears during normal embryogenesis,

401
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,820
no problem, they can still navigate morphospace,

402
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,900
they can navigate a path to where they need to be

403
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,060
from this completely unexpected starting position.

404
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,460
So this, if we had a swarm robotics instance

405
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,060
that was able to do this, instead of cells,

406
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,900
we have little robots that could do this,

407
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,180
this would be a remarkable example

408
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,180
of collective intelligence.

409
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,500
And so it is here.

410
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,620
These are groups of cells that are able to solve this problem

411
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,420
from different starting configurations.

412
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,340
And this is the process that collective intelligence

413
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,020
and that problem solving is what we need to solve

414
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,700
in addition to all of the mechanistic advances

415
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,020
over the component pathways

416
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,360
in order to really control anatomy

417
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,940
and to really solve regenerative medicine.

418
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,180
So what we would like to do is to try to move

419
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,940
to a point where we really understand this

420
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,540
at an algorithmic level,

421
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,780
not just the mechanisms that are required for this to happen,

422
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,300
but the algorithms that are sufficient for this to happen.

423
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,980
And we really need to understand

424
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,860
how these cellular collectives process information

425
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,420
and how reprogrammable really is it.

426
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:17,420
So computer science offers us an interesting analogy.

427
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,140
Back in the 1940s and 50s, this is what programming looked

428
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,980
like.

429
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,820
So in order to program this computer,

430
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,900
you have to physically move the wires around.

431
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,700
You have to physically change the structure of the machine.

432
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,620
And since then, the journey that computer science has taken

433
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,180
is to realize that if your hardware is good enough,

434
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,740
if it's reprogrammable,

435
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,240
then you don't need to physically change the hardware.

436
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,860
What you can do is interact with it

437
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,260
by means of inputs or experiences

438
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,620
and take advantage of the software that's in the system

439
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,820
and the plasticity that's in the system.

440
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:51,060
So of course, what you'll notice

441
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,620
that all of modern biology is basically down here

442
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,460
at this point.

443
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,100
All of the exciting advances are single molecule approaches.

444
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,100
We're rewiring pathways, genomic editing.

445
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
Everything is about getting more and more specific

446
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,100
at the low level of the hardware.

447
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,740
And these are very important things,

448
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,060
but they need to be coupled with an understanding

449
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,740
of what the software looks like

450
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,700
and how much we can get done with stimuli,

451
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,980
not with rewiring, whether it be genetic or otherwise.

452
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,220
And so the framework that we work in

453
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,700
looks a little bit more like this,

454
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,700
where yes, there's this feed forward component,

455
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,820
but there's also a very important set of feedback loops

456
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,540
where any challenge to the body,

457
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,100
and this could be traumatic injury,

458
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,580
this could be aging, this could be teratogens,

459
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,780
pathogens, whatever triggers a set of feedback loops,

460
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,980
both at the level of physics and genetics

461
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,900
that serves to get back to the correct target morphology.

462
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,280
Anybody that's taken engineering

463
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,020
will immediately recognize this as a homeostatic cycle.

464
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,340
It's basically what you have

465
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,180
in your thermostatic home,

466
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,460
where this is a system that's able to regulate

467
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,220
back to the correct state.

468
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,220
Now, of course, feedback is not new,

469
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,460
biologists all understand about the importance of feedback,

470
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,620
but there are two unusual things here in this model

471
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,900
that I'm going to talk about.

472
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,620
The first is that the set point

473
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,620
for this homeostatic process is not a simple number

474
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,260
or a scalar, like a temperature or pH or hunger level

475
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,420
or anything like that.

476
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,860
It's actually a much more complex structure

477
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,860
that's a coarse-graining of the anatomy.

478
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,380
So large-scale patterning information

479
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,700
is what's guiding this homeostatic process.

480
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,980
And the second part that's kind of unusual

481
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,940
is that this is a process that has a goal.

482
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,300
And when I say goal, this is not in some mystical sense,

483
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,660
it's basically in the sense of cybernetics

484
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,540
and control theory.

485
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,700
There's a set point, and this is a system

486
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,220
that's fundamentally able to expand energy and effort

487
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,100
to get back to the correct region of state space

488
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,300
by activating all kinds of cellular behaviors

489
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,300
to get back as close as possible to minimize error

490
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,460
and minimize the difference

491
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,300
between whatever the current shape is

492
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,980
and the shape that it's supposed to have.

493
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,260
So if you make that hypothesis,

494
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,820
it has a couple of strong predictions.

495
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,500
One strong prediction is that you ought to be able to find

496
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,700
the medium in which that target morphology is encoded.

497
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,420
So the set point has to be recorded somewhere.

498
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,460
And then it means that you could alter that set point,

499
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,940
you could rewrite it and ask the machine

500
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,460
to build something different without having to rewire it.

501
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,140
In the same way that you can set your thermostat

502
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,100
to a different temperature,

503
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,380
and the exact same system will now maintain

504
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,380
a different temperature

505
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,860
because there's a distinction between the data

506
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,340
and the execution here.

507
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,980
So this is what we've been doing in my group

508
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,540
for some years now is saying,

509
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,420
can we find the representation of the target morphology

510
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,660
and exploit it for regenerative medicine?

511
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,540
And I think we found an important chunk of it.

512
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,580
And so in order to tell you

513
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,780
how that target morphology is encoded,

514
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,980
I have to introduce you to developmental bioelectricity.

515
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:01,020
And all cells in the body are sitting

516
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,860
in a morphogenetic field of information

517
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,820
that comes in all kinds of different media.

518
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,180
So there's chemical gradients,

519
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,500
extracellular matrix, tensions and stresses and so on.

520
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,100
And then the one that we're interested in is bioelectricity.

521
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,780
So bioelectricity is not the only important layer,

522
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,620
but it's a, I think, a uniquely powerful and interesting one.

523
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,020
And that's the one we'll be talking about now.

524
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,700
Okay, so what is bioelectricity?

525
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,620
Well, let's think about what happens in the brain.

526
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,620
In the brain, you have networks of these cells called neurons.

527
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,180
They all have ion channels.

528
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,980
They create voltage potentials

529
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,700
by passing ions in and out of these ion channels.

530
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,900
And they can pass those electrical states

531
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,980
to their neighbors through these little electrical synapse.

532
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,100
The synapse is known as gap junctions.

533
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,020
And networks of these cells have this really interesting

534
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,380
property that they can execute physiological

535
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,180
information processing that we associate with memory,

536
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,460
with behavior, with goal-directed activity,

537
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,100
with preferences and so on.

538
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,980
And so what you can see here is an example

539
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,860
of tracking electrical activity in the brain.

540
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,380
So this happens to be a zebrafish,

541
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,980
thinking about whatever the zebrafish think about.

542
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,020
And you can literally see the electrical activity

543
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,140
and neuroscience has the following commitment.

544
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,220
We think that if we understood the encoding,

545
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,740
if we understood the neural electric code,

546
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,460
we could look at this electrical activity

547
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,660
and extract the semantic information.

548
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,380
We would know what is the meaning to the animal?

549
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,220
What is the content of that memory

550
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,420
of whatever it's thinking about?

551
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,060
Okay, and so people are working on

552
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,940
and have had some success with all kinds of decoding methods

553
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,420
to try and pull that information

554
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,540
out of electrical activity in the brain.

555
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,140
Well, you can sort of ask yourself,

556
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
where did this all come from?

557
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,220
Certainly this didn't just evolve out of nowhere.

558
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,700
It must have had a simpler evolutionary precursor,

559
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,460
and it did.

560
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,140
The evolutionary precursor is the fact

561
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,500
that all cells do this, not just neurons.

562
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,380
So every cell has high-end channels.

563
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,300
Most cells have gap junctions to their neighbors.

564
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,660
And this kind of scheme of putting

565
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,820
electrically active subunits into networks

566
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,740
is about as old as bacterial biofilms.

567
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,220
It's an extremely ancient evolutionary thing.

568
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,340
And all cells do this.

569
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,340
And so what you're seeing here is an early frog embryo

570
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,740
in time-lapse, where the cells are having discussions

571
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,900
with each other electrically about who's going to be

572
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,940
if anterior, posterior, left, right,

573
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,460
dorsal ventral, and so on.

574
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,700
Because whereas the electrical activity in the brain

575
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,700
is designed to move, to activate muscles to move the body

576
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,340
to solve problems in three-dimensional space,

577
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,500
what developmental bioelectricity does

578
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,060
is process information to move the body through morphospace

579
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,100
to change and control morphogenesis.

580
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,380
And we can do this, the exact same thing here.

581
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,860
We can try to decode this to try to understand

582
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,780
how is it that specific patterns arise

583
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,300
and how can we change them?

584
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,100
So my lab has developed some tools to do this.

585
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,740
So first, here are voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes.

586
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,580
And this is my colleague, Danny Adams,

587
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,500
who has perfected this particular technique

588
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,980
of using voltage reporters.

589
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,100
So this is not a model, this is an actual embryo,

590
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,780
using these voltage dyes to read in real time

591
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,740
all the electrical conversations

592
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,260
that these cells are having.

593
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,620
We, of course, do lots of computational modeling.

594
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,700
And then more importantly, we have functional techniques

595
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,660
where you can go in and change

596
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,820
the electrical information processing in the tissue.

597
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,940
We do not use electrodes, applied electric fields,

598
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,780
there's no electromagnetics going on.

599
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,580
This is purely molecular physiology

600
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,980
to target the native processes

601
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,700
by which these cells are communicating electrically.

602
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,700
So there are ways to control the topology of the network,

603
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,740
so which cells talk to each other cells

604
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,060
through these gap junctions.

605
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,460
We can open them, we can close them,

606
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,860
we can mutate them and so on.

607
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,500
And the same thing for the ion channels.

608
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,460
We can go in and literally set the electrical states

609
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,060
you could either optogenetics or drugs or mutations

610
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,020
that change the channel properties.

611
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,820
So basically taking all the tools of neuroscience

612
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,700
and using them to control morphogenetic decision-making

613
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,540
outside of the nervous system.

614
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,140
And so this is just a simple example

615
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,620
of what some of these endogenous patterns look like.

616
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,540
Here you see, again, a time lapse,

617
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,860
this embryo is putting its tadpole face together.

618
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,540
You can see all the dynamic electrical patterns.

619
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,580
Here's one frame from that movie.

620
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,460
And the amazing thing is,

621
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,340
and the reason I love this example so much

622
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,780
is that the encoding is really simple here.

623
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,700
The electric, we call this the electric face.

624
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,620
The bi-electric pattern of the face actually looks like a face.

625
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,660
And this shows up before the genes are turned on

626
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,380
to regionalize the face.

627
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,220
And so here you can see,

628
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,620
here's where the eye is going to be,

629
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,540
here are the placodes,

630
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,260
here's where the mouth is going to be.

631
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,620
All these bi-electrical gradients are a pre-pattern.

632
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,340
They're a subtle scaffold

633
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,140
that directs downstream gene expression and anatomy.

634
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,260
And if we go in and we change the distribution

635
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,420
of voltages here,

636
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,820
you will change the gene expression

637
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,900
and you will change the anatomy.

638
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,940
That is one way to make those Picasso tadpoles

639
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,980
that I showed you about.

640
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,780
So this is a native pattern that is required.

641
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,900
It's a normal, natural part of specifying

642
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,740
what the tadpole face is going to look like.

643
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,420
Here's a pathological pattern.

644
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,180
What we've done here is,

645
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,460
what we've done here is inject a human oncogene

646
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,300
into this tadpole.

647
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,020
They will make tumors like this.

648
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,140
But before they do,

649
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,060
you can already see using this bi-electric map,

650
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,340
you can already see that these cells

651
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,540
have a really aberrant electrical potential.

652
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,980
They are dissociating from the electrical network.

653
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,260
They're basically reverting back to their unicellular state

654
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,900
and they're going to treat the rest of the animal

655
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,260
as just external environment.

656
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,180
They've unplugged from the collective

657
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,380
and this is metastasis.

658
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,300
This is failure to participate in embryogenesis

659
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,980
because the first thing that oncogenes do

660
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,940
is uncouple you from the electric network

661
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,860
that normally tells every cell what it should be doing.

662
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,260
So the reason we know this is important

663
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,460
is that if you inject tumors

664
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,980
like nasty KRAS mutations and so on,

665
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,860
if you inject these things and cause tumors,

666
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,500
you can prevent the actual tumor genesis

667
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,780
even though the oncogene is very strongly expressed.

668
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,460
So here, this is the same animal.

669
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,420
So here's the oncogene that we've labeled it with red,

670
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,860
very strongly expressed and yet there's no tumor

671
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,860
because what we've done is co-inject an ion channel

672
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:33,220
that forces these cells into a voltage state

673
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,020
that keeps them coupled to the rest of the electrical network

674
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,740
and they simply don't progress

675
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,980
to tumor genesis or metastasis.

676
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,980
So we know this is instructive.

677
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,980
Now, going beyond the single cell property

678
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,220
of conversion to cancer,

679
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,500
we could look at morphogenesis

680
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,460
and we can say, okay, here's a tadpole.

681
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,300
Let's take a region of the gut.

682
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,100
So here, these are some cells in the embryo

683
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,660
that are going to become gut

684
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,620
and we're going to inject some ion channels

685
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,940
that will set a voltage state

686
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,380
that normally is associated with making an eye.

687
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,220
And guess what happens?

688
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,100
These cells, once you instruct them that way,

689
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,580
they will in fact build an eye

690
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,860
out of cells that were fated to be gut

691
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,140
and you can make these eyes anywhere,

692
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,580
on the tails, spinal cord, in the gut, whatever.

693
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,420
They have all the correct layers,

694
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,260
the retina, optic nerve, all of that.

695
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,420
And also pretty cool is that they instruct their neighbors.

696
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,260
So these blue cells here are the ones

697
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,620
whose voltage we changed

698
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,580
and they recruited a whole bunch of other cells

699
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,060
which we never touched directly, right?

700
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,700
These are just neighboring cells

701
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,900
that they recruit to make this nice lens

702
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,460
that's sitting out in the tail of this tadpole.

703
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,460
And so we can use this technique.

704
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,740
We can induce eyes, brains, hearts and other things.

705
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,180
And then there's many things that we can't,

706
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,420
we don't know how to make it.

707
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,620
So the point is that these bioelectrical gradients

708
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,020
are instructive for anatomy.

709
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,220
They control at the large scale.

710
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,060
And one of the most important features of this

711
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,860
is that we don't have to micromanage this process.

712
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,100
So what we basically found is an instructive hooking

713
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,380
to subroutines that say make an eye here

714
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,180
or make a heart here or make a brain here.

715
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,180
We don't have to go in and give all the information about,

716
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,100
well, how do you make an eye?

717
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,180
What are all the layers?

718
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,140
What are all the cell differentiation cascades?

719
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,860
What are all the genes that have to be expressed?

720
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,340
That would be incredibly difficult.

721
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,420
We're nowhere near being able to do that

722
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,500
as a field, but what you can do

723
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,500
is find the native modular control structure

724
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,420
in the bioelectric layer

725
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,900
that determines which organs get placed in what regions.

726
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,660
And then the cells will take it from there

727
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,380
once you've instructed them what to do.

728
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,420
They will turn on all the things they need.

729
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,260
So let's look at the planaria

730
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,500
because this is really interesting.

731
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,900
In a planarian, you chop off the head and the tail.

732
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,980
You got this middle fragment,

733
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,060
the middle fragment has to know to build a new head here

734
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,020
and a new tail here.

735
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,180
How does it know to do that?

736
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,020
Well, it has this interesting voltage gradient

737
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,540
that says one head here in this depolarized region,

738
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,620
one tail here.

739
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,220
And if we go in and we artificially manipulate

740
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,580
the voltage back here to be depolarized,

741
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,740
then sure enough, these cells will build what you said

742
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,460
and they will make a two-headed animal.

743
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,820
And these are perfectly viable.

744
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,060
So you can make a two-headed animal,

745
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,980
you can make a no-headed animal, okay?

746
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,580
So again, instructive,

747
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,940
and all we've done is activate the build ahead subroutine

748
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,220
and we've done it here at this particular region

749
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,460
without actually knowing too much about how you go

750
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,060
about building ahead in the first place.

751
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,300
The cells will turn on and off all the genes that they need

752
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,980
once they've received this high-level instruction

753
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,780
about what organ they're supposed to build.

754
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,380
Not only can you build ectopic heads of the same animal,

755
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,460
you can actually build heads appropriate to other species.

756
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,540
Okay, so if we take this planarian

757
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,420
with a nice triangular head here, chop off the head,

758
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,060
perturb the electrical network

759
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,140
and you can get flat heads like a Pifelina,

760
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,980
you can get round heads like an S-Mediterranean,

761
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,780
or you can get your normal triangular heads.

762
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,860
And not only do you get the head shape,

763
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,500
but actually the brain shape changes

764
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,180
in the distribution of stem cells

765
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,820
becomes just like these other species

766
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,580
because the space of possible outcomes

767
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,140
of this electrical circuit contains attractors

768
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,480
that correspond to other species

769
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,780
that evolution has found in the past, okay?

770
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,740
And you can dial in those without any changes

771
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,140
to the genomics, so both in here

772
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,060
and in the two-headed animals I showed you,

773
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,100
there's nothing wrong with the genome.

774
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,980
The genetics are completely wild type.

775
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,060
This is modifying the information

776
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,380
stored in the electrical network

777
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,140
and you can access other attractors

778
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,580
that belong to other species

779
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,860
with the exact same genetically normal cells.

780
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,140
And in fact, you can access regions of that state space

781
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,720
that evolution doesn't use because they're not viable.

782
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,580
You can take flat planaria and turn them

783
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,500
into these weird spiky forms.

784
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,340
You can make these three-dimensional things

785
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,740
that look like hats.

786
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,180
You can make this kind of thing,

787
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,700
which are sort of combinations.

788
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,780
The flatworms don't even need to be flat anymore.

789
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,980
And so the idea here is that you can really have

790
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,340
drastic control over large-scale anatomy

791
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,700
given the same genome because what the genome builds

792
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,420
is cellular collectives that use electricity

793
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:08,420
to store their set points, their target morphologies.

794
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,060
And this should sound like a very familiar story

795
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,660
for neuroscientists because that's exactly

796
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,260
how brains work.

797
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:19,980
So getting to the sort of applied regenerative medicine side

798
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,580
of this, unlike salamanders, frogs

799
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,780
do not regenerate their legs.

800
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,780
And what we've done is we've taken froglets

801
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,300
and we've designed, we've used this information

802
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,340
to design a cocktail of drugs

803
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,420
that change the electrical state of the wound.

804
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,900
And you can see here normally in the frog,

805
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,900
you amputate the leg and there's basically nothing

806
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,020
in 45 days.

807
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,500
We add the cocktail, the application's actually

808
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,420
just for 48 hours, sorry, 24 hours, so one day.

809
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,140
And after that one day exposure,

810
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,820
it kick starts the whole cascade.

811
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,980
So here pro regenerative genes become turned on.

812
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,420
So this is MSX1.

813
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,060
And then immediately you start growing this leg.

814
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,900
By 45 days later, you've got some toes,

815
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,580
you've got a toenail, eventually a very nice leg.

816
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,700
And you can see that the leg is

817
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,900
both touch sensitive and motile.

818
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,940
So what you can do is override the normal program

819
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,100
of growth, which is normally very little,

820
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,220
and give the whole thing of a simple signal

821
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,740
over 24 hours that then is picked up

822
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,020
by all the transcriptional cascades and everything else

823
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,300
that will work over months.

824
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,300
In fact, our latest paper, 13 months of leg growth

825
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,540
following one day treatment.

826
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,220
And so we've looked at this in,

827
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,300
so these are frogs and worms,

828
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,540
we've looked at this in human mesenchymal stem cells

829
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,100
and cardiomyocytes and so on.

830
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,820
And it's very highly conserved.

831
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,740
It works throughout the tree of life.

832
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,620
We know it's relevant to humans

833
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,420
because of human channelopathies.

834
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,460
So lots of human ion channel mutations give rise

835
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,980
to different kinds of birth defects,

836
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,140
telling us that even in humans,

837
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,700
these electrical properties are very important

838
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,980
for setting correct morphologies.

839
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:57,820
And so what we do now,

840
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,220
and so this is our company with David Kaplan,

841
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:05,900
we have a company that's focused on David's lab

842
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,340
builds these bioreactors,

843
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:12,340
which basically deliver cocktails of ion channel drugs

844
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,260
that are picked by us to induce pro-regenerative states.

845
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,660
And we are now having more or less solved it in frog.

846
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,860
We are now in mammals, we're doing this in mice.

847
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,540
And then hopefully someday hopefully humans, of course.

848
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,900
So just to start wrapping up here,

849
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,460
the point of all of this is that

850
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:33,060
we now are starting to understand the circuits

851
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,660
to the point where we can make multi-scale models.

852
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,700
So we start with knowing what genes are there

853
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,140
to produce various types of ion channels,

854
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,660
but these ion channels open and close.

855
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,020
So simply knowing the genes

856
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,220
doesn't tell you what the electrical states are going to be.

857
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,860
You have to simulate the physiological tissues

858
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,180
and those give rise to larger organ structures.

859
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,260
And eventually you can get down to algorithmic types

860
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,340
of control that show you how the electrical activity

861
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,420
in these tissues makes decisions

862
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,020
about what's going to go where.

863
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,300
So you go from the genomically specified hardware

864
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,700
to the low level and then the higher level software

865
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,180
that allows these cells to make the kinds of decisions

866
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:14,420
to robustly create and repair complex morphologies, okay?

867
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,060
And so in that process, of course,

868
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,220
there's a huge opportunity for application

869
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,060
for machine learning.

870
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,060
And so we've done some of this,

871
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,700
use machine learning to both discover the electrical circuits

872
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,580
and to discover the modulations

873
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,940
that are needed to use these therapeutically.

874
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,380
And just as a very simple,

875
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,140
I'll just close up here with a couple of slides

876
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,940
to show you a very simple example.

877
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,660
This is what a normal tadpole brain looks like.

878
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,140
And if you perturb it with a mutation,

879
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,300
let's say in a really important gene like notch,

880
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,100
which basically the forebrain is gone,

881
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,100
the midbrain is a bubble,

882
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,020
the hindbrain is also a bubble,

883
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,260
it's just they have no behavior that's laid there.

884
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,540
And what you can do is create a model

885
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,780
with the bioelectric circuit that determines brain shape

886
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,300
and ask it in under circumstances like this,

887
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,860
that either there's a mutation

888
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,380
or they've been hit by alcohol or nicotine

889
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,740
or some other kind of poison,

890
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,340
what would you have to change?

891
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,820
Which channels would you open and close

892
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,500
to get back to this correct bioelectric pattern

893
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,060
that is responsible for a normal brain?

894
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,380
And so the model is actually now sufficiently detailed

895
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,140
that it can actually tell us what channel is

896
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,060
and using that we can pick drugs.

897
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,460
So known ion channel drugs and when you do this,

898
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,380
you get back the correct brain shape,

899
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,900
the correct brain size and you get their behavior,

900
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,820
you get their IQs back,

901
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,660
so their learning rates are back to normal,

902
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,380
despite the fact that they've had really debilitating mutations

903
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,220
or exposure to teratogens like nicotine or alcohol

904
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,340
and so on.

905
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,780
Okay, so this is an example of starting off

906
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,780
with a basic understanding of bioelectric circuits

907
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,580
and how they work to a computational model

908
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,780
that actually helps you design therapeutics

909
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,940
to fix a rather complex outcome,

910
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,700
which is brain development.

911
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,380
Okay, and so what we are doing now

912
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,620
is we're trying to create a complete pipeline

913
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,740
where you start off with existing information

914
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,660
on what ion channels are in your tissue of interest,

915
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,700
what bioelectrical state do you want

916
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,100
and then use the model and the simulations

917
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:17,020
to tell you what channel openers and blockers do you need,

918
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,540
something like 20% of all drugs are ion channel drugs.

919
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:23,260
So there's this huge toolkit that we call electroseuticals,

920
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:27,060
which with the correct computational simulations,

921
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:31,180
you can actually start to deploy outside of things

922
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:33,660
like cardiac arrhythmia as an epilepsy,

923
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,860
as all those drugs can be repurposed now

924
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,020
for regenerative medicine.

925
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,340
And so this is an example of our software,

926
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,100
you can all play with it.

927
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,020
It's online and the idea is that you would pick

928
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,980
the tissues you want and it would actually help you

929
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,380
pick the correct drugs.

930
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,580
So I'll just close here and just summarize what I've told you

931
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,980
is that there's this incredibly powerful

932
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,100
physiological software layer

933
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,660
that sits between the genotype and the anatomy.

934
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,380
And it's a really trackable target

935
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,380
for regenerative biomedicine.

936
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,020
Evolution discovered very early

937
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,020
that electrical signaling is a really convenient medium

938
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,700
for computation and global decision-making.

939
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,100
And this is why brains exploit it,

940
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,140
this is why our computer technology exploits it

941
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,300
and this is why morphogenesis runs on the system.

942
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,220
Cracking this code, you can really give us the opportunity

943
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,300
to rewrite the pattern memories

944
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:30,700
that allow us to control large-scale shape.

945
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,820
And when I say pattern memories,

946
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,420
I mean, these are literally those two-headed worms

947
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,700
that I showed you, if you now cut them into pieces

948
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,820
with no more manipulation of any kind,

949
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,660
they continue to make two-headed animals,

950
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,860
even though their genomes are wild type, okay?

951
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:46,780
This is that memory, that electrical circuit

952
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,380
really keeps the memory and so you can set it back

953
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,380
to being one-headed, but until you do that,

954
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,580
the pieces will continue to make two-headed worms, okay?

955
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,100
And so new artificial intelligence tools

956
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,420
are now coming online to help us design

957
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,340
these kinds of strategies.

958
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,900
So it's now rational design to address birth defects,

959
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,660
cancer and regeneration.

960
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,380
And also our latest work has been

961
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,060
on making synthetic living organisms.

962
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,380
So with that, I'd like to thank the people

963
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,780
who contributed to all this work,

964
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,140
our funders, and I'll thank all of you for listening.

965
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,940
And if we could take a five-minute break

966
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,300
and then I'll come back and I'm happy to answer

967
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,220
any questions.

968
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,460
Wow, that was a lot.

969
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,900
I think we do need a break.

970
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,740
We will let you go for now and have you back in five minutes.

971
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,420
Thank you so, so much already.

972
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,860
And there's lots of questions in the chat,

973
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,340
but I will moderate them and we'll see you in a bit.

974
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,860
Perfect, five minutes.

975
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,180
Okay, sounds great.

976
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,300
Okay, lovely.

977
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,180
Well, that was quite a lot to digest.

978
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,820
I'll keep the questions coming and also

979
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,380
upvote the ones that you want to push forward.

980
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,420
He already agreed that he can stay on for half an hour,

981
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,580
up to half an hour longer.

982
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,620
So for those of you who want to learn more about this,

983
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,900
feel free to join longer.

984
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,060
For now, we have lots of exciting community updates,

985
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,580
lots of exciting projects and events

986
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,660
and fellowships and hackathons and so forth

987
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,620
in the community.

988
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,660
We will start with Elena.

989
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,380
Elena, if you're here, feel free to unmute

990
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,300
and tell us about your upcoming conference.

991
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,540
Yeah, hello everyone.

992
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,660
Very nice to see a lot of useful developments in the field

993
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,980
and hear all those awesome talks.

994
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:24,020
I'm actually a very big fan of this group,

995
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,420
even though not always can I attend.

996
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,980
Anyways, I just wanted to let you know that soon

997
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,780
we're going to have our fourth annual conference

998
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,100
and in Agile of the Diseases 2021.

999
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,020
It's going to take place virtually this year again

1000
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,100
because we're not so sure that it's safe

1001
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,620
for all of us together.

1002
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,340
We hope that it will change in the next years, of course.

1003
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,660
So the conference is going to take place on August 1922

1004
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,980
and in the Eastern time zone.

1005
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,500
So we will focus on the four traditional topics,

1006
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,220
which will be the mechanisms of aging,

1007
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,820
the human trials of rejuvenation by technology therapies,

1008
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,180
the biomarkers of aging,

1009
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,300
and of course traditionally investment matters

1010
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,580
and regulatory matters.

1011
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,980
As usual, we have a number of prominent researchers

1012
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,940
giving their talks.

1013
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,700
Some of the information is going to be pretty fresh

1014
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,580
just from the lab.

1015
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,380
So I hope that you will have a look

1016
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,980
at the program of the conference

1017
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,180
and probably get inspired and come join us this year.

1018
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,580

Lovely.

1028
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,340
Okay.

1029
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,660
Next on up, we have Anastasia.

1030
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,940
Anastasia, are you here?

1031
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,300
Oh, can you hear me?

1032
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,140
Yes.

1033
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,300
Wow, lovely background.

1034
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,140
Thank you.

1035
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,300
It's Idaho.

1036
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,140
Yeah.

1037
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:10,980
Thanks, Alison.

1038
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,980
And great to meet you all on this regular meetings

1039
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,940
that are really great and informative.

1040
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,580
Some of you might know me.

1041
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,980
And so I work with Ranjan.

1042
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,260
Ranjan is the founder of R42 Group.

1043
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,620
We are a fund and also investing in AI and longevity

1044
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,540
and also an institute.

1045
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,060
Part of our institute that we have is Fellowship.

1046
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,300
So it's AI Fellowship.

1047
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:37,660
And we're now in our cohort four.

1048
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:40,180
And our demo day is actually tomorrow

1049
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,300
between 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. noon Pacific.

1050
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,660
Some really great projects.

1051
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,020
Students from all over the world were working

1052
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,340
on these projects over the 12 week period.

1053
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,420
So they include mathematics, adventure capital,

1054
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,100
no code, machine learning platform

1055
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:00,860
for biomedical researchers, cancer biology,

1056
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:04,420
just kind of a wide range of really exciting projects.

1057
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,220
So you're all welcome to come.

1058
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,180
And I'll send you the schedule

1059
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:10,740
and also the registration link in the chat,

1060
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,060
as well as, yeah, feel free to pop in and out

1061
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,740
and come for all our new presentations.

1062
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,300
So, yeah, great.

1063
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,340
And yes.

1064
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,420
Thank you.

1065
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:22,660
Here, you might add a few words.

1066
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:27,060
Let us know in case you wanna do so, Ranjan.

1067
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,780
Otherwise, we look forward to-

1068
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,740
Yes, that's okay.

1069
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:30,580
It's free.

1070
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,420
I'll just add it's free.

1071
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:36,380
And we're gonna have the first holographic telephone call

1072
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,940
tomorrow between England and Silicon Valley.

1073
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,260
So that'll be around about 11 a.m. Pacific.

1074
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,100
Exciting stuff.

1075
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,860
You're taking the A.I. theme very meta.

1076
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,020
Okay, lovely.

1077
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,580
Next one up, we have Dima.

1078
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,540
Yeah, hi, everyone.

1079
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,460
So we're organizing a longevity hackathon.

1080
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,020
So it's a 48 hour event

1081
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,420
to bring the ideas to fruition in longevity

1082
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,340
and the ideas to bring together longevity researchers,

1083
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,660
developers, A.I. scientists, entrepreneurs,

1084
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,780
attract people from outside the field as well,

1085
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,660
help them build teams and tackle the kind of

1086
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,620
like long hanging fruits that you can actually,

1087
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,460
or you can actually produce innovation over just 48 hours.

1088
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:21,140
So if there's topics from biotech, A.I., pharma,

1089
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,700
we already have people from all continents,

1090
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,500
except perhaps like Antarctica and Australia,

1091
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,460
but like there's people joining from all over the world.

1092
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,660
There's longevity tech funds.

1093
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:35,820
We'll invest 100K into the winning teams.

1094
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,540
So I'm also confident that this will continue afterwards.

1095
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,620
And then Forsyte Institute is also supporting

1096
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,460
with the fellowship for 2022.

1097
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:45,580
So yeah, please join.

1098
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,980
We're still looking for sponsors and mentors

1099
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:48,820
filled with each other.

1100
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,260
And I'm gonna drop it in chat as well.

1101
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,020
The information about it.

1102
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:54,860
Thank you.

1103
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:55,940
Okay, I have one more to go,

1104
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:58,500
which is the Aging Research and Drug Development Conference

1105
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,660
in Copenhagen on August 31st to September 3rd.

1106
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:02,980
I'll drop a link to that.

1107
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:04,260
And as you can tell,

1108
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,140
there's lots of exciting stuff happening.

1109
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,660
Nathan, I think is on the call for the fellowship.

1110
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,620
I reached out to you earlier,

1111
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,700
if you wanna say something to your feet to do so now,

1112
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,700
or in the chat.

1113
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,580
Otherwise, I think we have Michael back.

1114
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,420
Okay, Michael, are you back?

1115
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,260
I'm back.

1116
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,380
Okay, lovely.

1117
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,300
Okay, great.

1118
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:29,260
I think let's do maybe a few questions on the record.

1119
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,700
And if anyone prefers to have theirs off the record,

1120
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,980
then I'll turn the recording off for that.

1121
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,540
I think some people just prefer that

1122
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:37,660
for a more open discussion.

1123
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,980
But the first one that got uploaded a bunch is Carl.

1124
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,660
Carl asked, I think three questions

1125
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,220
so you can make your pick now.

1126
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,420
No pressure on you.

1127
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,420
This is totally good.

1128
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:47,300
These are good questions to be on the record

1129
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,420
because well, I mean, first of all,

1130
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,540
just let me say kudos.

1131
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,260
This is very awesome sounding stuff

1132
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,860
and kind of blows me away a little bit.

1133
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,980
So before getting into aging and regenerative medicine

1134
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,260
even just more basic back,

1135
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,300
I have loads of more basic background questions

1136
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,980
about these bioelectric networks.

1137
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:08,420
So the meta question in,

1138
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,180
I'll just give two example questions.

1139
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:15,180
The meta question that the myriad of questions raises

1140
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,660
is what's the best modern review or textbook

1141
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,060
that introduces all those people who don't know anything

1142
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,700
about these bioelectric networks to that.

1143
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,620
But so the two example questions I had right away were,

1144
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,940
what is the down, you know, what is within a cell,

1145
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:34,220
what is the pathway for this bioelectrics

1146
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,740
to actually control gene expression, right?

1147
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,540
So what's going on in the cell that way?

1148
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:42,660
How does it work epigenetically?

1149
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,900
And then the other question I wrote was,

1150
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:51,420
in non-regenerative species after development,

1151
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:54,780
what do these bioelectric networks do with anything?

1152
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,180
Yeah, yeah, great.

1153
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,660
Okay, three questions.

1154
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,060
Let's see, as far as reviews.

1155
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,500
So I have lots, I've written lots.

1156
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,340
A couple of other people have written some good ones.

1157
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,740
Anybody who's interested, please email me.

1158
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,100
Or if you guys have some sort of a form

1159
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,860
that I can post this at, I will post.

1160
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,780
If you just tell Alison later offline, she can forward it.

1161
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,620
Sure, yeah, I will.

1162
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,660
Yeah, we've written tons of very basic reviews

1163
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,260
on this stuff, taking you from zero

1164
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,700
all the way to what's known today.

1165
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:27,700
Okay, the second question is a transduction to gene expression.

1166
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:33,380
So on the single cell level,

1167
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,500
we know there are about half a dozen ways

1168
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,780
in which voltage change regulates downstream gene expression.

1169
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,940
So this includes things that you're familiar with,

1170
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,020
the neuroscience, for example,

1171
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:45,620
voltage-gated calcium signals

1172
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,500
followed by calcium transduction.

1173
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,780
This includes control of neurotransmitter movement

1174
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,340
like serotonin between cells through gap junctions

1175
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,660
or through the serotonin transporter.

1176
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,500
And this includes some more exotic things

1177
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
like voltage-sensitive phosphatases.

1178
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,580
It includes things like voltage-gated butyrate transporters

1179
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,420
that then hit HDAC and those kind of

1180
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,020
epichromatin modification pathways.

1181
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,420
All of that is known.

1182
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:14,420
I should say, though, that it's highly unsatisfying

1183
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,740
because what that, I mean, it's good information,

1184
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:18,700
it's good to have that.

1185
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:22,260
The problem is all of that is single cell level data.

1186
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,020
And if you want to know why your hand

1187
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,420
doesn't look like your foot,

1188
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,180
it's good to know the transduction on the single cell level,

1189
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,380
but you still have to ask about global dynamics

1190
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,580
that determine the size and the shape and the scaling.

1191
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,220
It's not enough to know what the transduction

1192
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,980
looks like on the single cell.

1193
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,820
And what's the, oh, what's it doing in adults?

1194
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:46,100
I think what it's doing in adults is morphostasis.

1195
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,700
So it's keeping you together

1196
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:51,940
against individual cell senescence and turnover.

1197
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:55,260
So usually what it's, and by the way,

1198
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:57,780
the interface between bioelectricity and aging

1199
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,140
is not well understood at all.

1200
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,340
No one has studied it, right?

1201
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,700
We haven't even touched it.

1202
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,580
So it's not as if we know what the answer is,

1203
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,540
but basically I think probably what it's doing

1204
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:10,340
is it's just cancer suppression and morphostasis

1205
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,940
and keeping your tissues together.

1206
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,340
And it's really activating those very dynamic

1207
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,620
morphogenetic rearrangement modules

1208
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:20,020
that is needed to really sort of rejuvenate

1209
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,380
and restore after injury.

1210
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:25,820
Are you satisfied?

1211
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:26,780
Okay, lovely.

1212
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,780
Glad you snuck three questions and Carl.

1213
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,580
Okay, next one up, we have one out.

1214
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:37,540
You do?

1215
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:38,380
Okay.

1216
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,460
Fascinating stuff.

1217
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,340
So what is the, what controls the appearance

1218
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,900
of these electrical zones?

1219
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,100
What determines their dispersal as well?

1220
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:56,300
Yeah, so there's two important pieces to this.

1221
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,500
One important piece is what underlies the hardware itself.

1222
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:00,620
And so you have to ask,

1223
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,980
in order to have any kind of electrical states,

1224
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:05,660
you have to have the correct ion channels

1225
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,380
that are capable of producing them.

1226
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,980
So one thing that you need to understand

1227
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,100
is what channels are there and what are their properties?

1228
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,660
So for example, they might themselves be voltage sensitive

1229
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:16,300
or they might be pH gated or whatever,

1230
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,060
and this controls the properties of these channels

1231
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:26,060
are the excitable medium on which these electrical phenomena

1232
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:28,900
propagate.

1233
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,140
Now the specific patterns,

1234
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,140
let's say that electric face pattern is,

1235
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,340
it's an emergent pattern in the same way

1236
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:41,340
that Turing patterns emerge from an excitable chemical medium

1237
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:45,220
or the way that when we talk about this with my students,

1238
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,180
I start off and I say visualize,

1239
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,020
you have a collection of electric parts

1240
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,140
that make a calculator and when you turn it on,

1241
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:53,780
it has a default behavior, right?

1242
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:55,860
That the parts were chosen

1243
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,820
so that when a juice is turned on and the thing is running,

1244
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:03,820
it will by default start off at a consistent baseline

1245
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:05,740
emergent state, which is zero.

1246
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,220
Now, past that, it has interesting properties

1247
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:12,060
of reprogrammability and all kinds of other things it can do,

1248
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,980
but there's this basic state that the parts

1249
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,460
which are shaped by evolution,

1250
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,060
there's an emergent pattern

1251
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,780
and we can study that symmetry breaking.

1252
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,220
So it's a process of symmetry breaking

1253
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,940
of amplification of long range inhibition,

1254
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,180
short range activation that sets up,

1255
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,220
it sets up exactly two eye spots

1256
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,060
at a particular distance apart.

1257
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,960
All of these things can be modeled.

1258
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,860
Okay.

1259
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,300
Are you satisfied, Donald?

1260
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,660
Yes, okay, great.

1261
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,220
We'll do it.

1262
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:42,380
Lovely, great.

1263
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,620
Next up, we have Josh.

1264
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,940
Hey, thanks again for the talk.

1265
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,940
That was like super interesting.

1266
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,980
My question was for the worms to put planaria,

1267
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,140
is that how you pronounce it?

1268
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,660
If you chop, you mentioned that they could have

1269
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,380
like learned behaviors.

1270
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,060
I was curious if like the worms chopped

1271
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,740
with multiple pieces, once those pieces grow,

1272
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,580
if all the pieces retain those learned behaviors

1273
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,140
of like the original worm?

1274
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,780
Yeah, that's a great question.

1275
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:12,020
It was addressed first in the 60s by a guy named McConnell

1276
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:15,620
and he published his observations that in fact they do.

1277
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,060
So you can take a worm and you can train

1278
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,300
on a particular task, chop off the tail,

1279
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,060
raise a new worm from that tail.

1280
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:27,060
So we in 2013, we reproduced all that aspect

1281
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,380
of his work, he did other stuff,

1282
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,900
but that's what we reproduced and it's true, they do.

1283
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:33,100
So what that's telling you is that

1284
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:36,380
even learned sort of behavioral information,

1285
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:38,100
not just morphological information,

1286
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:42,980
is stored outside the brain in some form

1287
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:46,260
and is able to be imprinted on the new brain as it forms.

1288
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,100
It's pretty remarkable

1289
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,260
because that tail doesn't do anything

1290
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,420
until the new brain forms, right?

1291
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:50,540
So it grows a new brain

1292
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,700
and then the information is somehow imprinted.

1293
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,980
So what you're seeing is learned information

1294
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,340
moving around within the body.

1295
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,060
Super interesting, not well understood at all.

1296
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,700
Cool.

1297
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,620
Wow, okay, Ashish is next.

1298
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,780
Hi, Michael, very nice talk.

1299
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,620
Thank you.

1300
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:10,020
I wanted to ask which intervention tools

1301
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,820
are available right now for mainly

1302
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:14,740
for the regenerative medicine purposes?

1303
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:16,700
Is it mainly ion channel genes

1304
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,620
or something else also available?

1305
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:23,540
Yeah, the tools, I mean, as I see it,

1306
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,820
the best tools are the ion channel drugs.

1307
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,300
I mean, in model systems at the bench,

1308
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:32,380
ion channel genes are useful

1309
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,820
because they give you the cleanest,

1310
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:34,980
the genetic technologies,

1311
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,260
like the cleanest for getting pathway information.

1312
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,540
But I think in medical application,

1313
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,540
you don't want to have to do gene therapy

1314
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:44,780
every time you want to target these pathways

1315
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:45,740
and you don't have to

1316
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,780
because I think we've had great success

1317
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:51,500
using drugs together with the computational model.

1318
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,860
That's the key, you need both.

1319
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:55,660
You need the available toolkit of drugs

1320
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,900
that target all of these ion channels.

1321
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,500
And then you need the computational model

1322
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,700
to tell you which channels to turn on and off

1323
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,140
and when to get the correct outcome.

1324
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,540
And so I see that as the most important tool to get right now.

1325
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,820
It's the collection of channel drugs.

1326
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,380
All right, thank you very much.

1327
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:14,820
Lovely, we have Martin next.

1328
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:17,700
Hi, is there a relationship

1329
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:22,540
between endogenous peptide-based ionophores

1330
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,460
and the ionophores you're using?

1331
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:29,700
We have used, so the vast majority of our work

1332
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,900
is not with ionophores.

1333
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,660
We've done a little bit with ionophores.

1334
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,660
The main ionophore we've used is monensin

1335
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,420
and we've also used a couple other things.

1336
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:40,380
But I'm sure there are others.

1337
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:43,060
I mean, I don't know about the peptide-based ones.

1338
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,340
So maybe we should have a conversation offline

1339
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,540
so that I could learn more about them.

1340
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,340
But we've used things like monensin basically.

1341
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,980
Yeah, but the majority of things we use are not,

1342
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,220
the ionophores are really kind of a sledgehammer

1343
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:57,260
in many ways.

1344
00:54:57,260 --> 00:55:00,540
We tend to use very specific ion channel drugs

1345
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,500
that hit classes of different kinds of channels.

1346
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:05,660
Thank you.

1347
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:09,500
Thanks, next one up we have Alan.

1348
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,220
I can also ask you a question

1349
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:24,940
in case you're talking about muting.

1350
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:28,580
She's just asking, what is the cocktail that includes DPCA?

1351
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,140
Is this Ellen Heberkatz, is that right?

1352
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:35,900
Oh, hey, Ellen, it's been a while, I have a long time no see.

1353
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:39,860
Yeah, so there's a variety of cocktails.

1354
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:42,660
The earliest cocktail wasn't even a cocktail,

1355
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:43,900
it was extremely simple.

1356
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:46,820
It was just monensin.

1357
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:50,860
We had one after that that had progesterone

1358
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,380
and things like that.

1359
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:56,580
We are playing with DPCA, stay tuned.

1360
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:58,980
Among many other things,

1361
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,300
the current cocktail has five different ingredients

1362
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,540
and that paper should be out in a matter of weeks.

1363
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:07,100
So you'll see the cocktail,

1364
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,740
you'll see all the dosages and everything else.

1365
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,980
Okay, lovely, next one up, Anton.

1366
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:20,460
Hello, so I was really impressed by your in vivo results

1367
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,820
with fog limber generation,

1368
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:29,660
but I actually have a question regarding in vitro application,

1369
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:34,660
like can your drug cocktails and similar interventions

1370
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,740
be used for suspension culture

1371
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:42,100
to grow some vascularized organoids

1372
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:47,100
or some vascularized muscle tissues for clean meat application

1373
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,500
or for in vitro we have to do something quite different?

1374
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,380
Yeah, great question.

1375
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,540
So I think absolutely they can.

1376
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,740
We've not done that particular thing.

1377
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:02,660
What we have done with David Kaplan's group

1378
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:06,820
and some others is we've done in vitro with cell culture.

1379
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:10,540
So mammalian human cell culture, it absolutely works.

1380
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,940
So you can keep stem cells more stem-like,

1381
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:15,260
you can force stem cells to differentiate.

1382
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,500
You can do those kinds of things

1383
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,620
exactly the same methods.

1384
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:22,620
I think absolutely they would work in organoids.

1385
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:26,780
We are currently using them in our synthetic bio-bots

1386
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:29,940
which are sort of, it's like organoids one step further

1387
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,180
which they have organoids with behavior.

1388
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,020
So they move around, they do various things

1389
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,660
and that's what we're doing.

1390
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,820
But I would love to, if that's something you work on,

1391
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,420
drop me an email and let's talk about it

1392
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:43,500
because yeah, that's an open area of application

1393
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,700
that just nobody's gotten to it yet.

1394
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,540
Oh yeah, we work a bit, I will drop an email.

1395
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,420
Sure, drop me an email, yeah.

1396
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:51,740
Thank you.

1397
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,260
Vadim is up next.

1398
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,260
Thank you.

1399
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:59,260
Yeah, the answer to my question probably is not known

1400
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:02,700
but Michael, based on what, I mean,

1401
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,580
based on your understanding of the regeneration process

1402
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,460
in your systems, what do you think

1403
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:11,500
would be a biological age of the regenerated tissues?

1404
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,140
Would it be younger or the same age

1405
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,780
of the rest of the animal will be older?

1406
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,020
Great question.

1407
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,260
I don't know the answer to that.

1408
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,220
We have been working with,

1409
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:27,060
so Steve Hoverarth is making this methylation clock

1410
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,540
for various organisms and we're waiting

1411
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:33,460
till he calibrates the frog one and then we can see.

1412
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,980
That would be the easiest way to do it right now.

1413
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,780
If you have some other markers,

1414
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:40,900
I'd love to hear about it but we don't know.

1415
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,420
Actually, we are doing this together

1416
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:43,820
and we're waiting for this him for the frog.

1417
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:44,660
Oh, well, there you go.

1418
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:45,500
I said, okay, great.

1419
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,220
So, okay, so we'll, you know, as soon as you guys are ready,

1420
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:50,460
we'll, we can check it out.

1421
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:55,460
And maybe, you know, once we get the mice working,

1422
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,900
then we can check, I mean, that should be much easier.

1423
00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:00,340
Once we get the mice working,

1424
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,060
we can see what the mouse tissues look like.

1425
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,660
That stuff is still in progress.

1426
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,220
Fantastic, okay.

1427
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:09,180
Then next one up, let's take one

1428
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,460
who hasn't asked the question, Thomas Schwirder.

1429
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,140
Yeah, hi, fantastic talk.

1430
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:17,860
So I have a question basically about an example

1431
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,100
that you mentioned sort of in passing,

1432
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:24,100
which is the fact that in like deer antlers grow at rates

1433
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,540
on the order of centimeters per day.

1434
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,420
Now, you mentioned in the flatworms

1435
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,340
that you were able to sort of activate

1436
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:36,260
processes that happen in certain species

1437
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:38,580
in flatworms that are of other species.

1438
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,660
And what I'm wondering is whether you think

1439
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,020
it might be possible to use bioelectrical signaling

1440
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:47,140
to trigger bone regrowth on that same sort of order.

1441
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:51,260
Yeah, in kind of the same way.

1442
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:54,660
Yeah, I mean, optimistically, I think so.

1443
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,260
I, you know, it's entirely possible

1444
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,980
that we will run into some weird aspect of deer physiology

1445
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,100
that permits it, whereas for humans, it wouldn't work.

1446
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,740
I can't say that that doesn't exist.

1447
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:05,700
We don't know, but I don't think so.

1448
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:10,500
I think that, I think these are all very fundamental things

1449
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,020
and I can tell you some speculative stories

1450
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,980
about why I think humans normally don't do this kind of stuff.

1451
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,940
But I think it's there to be unlocked.

1452
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,980
I doubt it's gonna be a deer-specific issue, yeah.

1453
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,140
Thank you.

1454
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:24,620
Oh, lots of work to be done.

1455
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,700
Brad English.

1456
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:30,780
Yeah, you mentioned me.

1457
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,700
Sorry, you're breaking up.

1458
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:35,540
I can't hear.

1459
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,140
General pathways that you,

1460
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,340
maybe someone else can ask about the internet issue for me.

1461
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:41,940
My question's in the chat.

1462
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:45,500
Okay, have you tried sitting a plate of cells

1463
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,220
atop a conductive plate with a certain pattern

1464
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:50,780
to see if you could guide its development?

1465
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,500
Sorry, what do you mean by a conductive,

1466
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,260
but what's a conductive plate?

1467
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:57,660
Like with a voltage or current running through it to change,

1468
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:01,620
what would, yeah, the underlying firmware.

1469
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,940
Yeah, got it, got it.

1470
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:05,940
You can, okay, so generally speaking,

1471
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:10,540
using external electrical signals,

1472
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:13,500
like using electrodes basically,

1473
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,060
is you can do certain things that way.

1474
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,260
So one thing you can do that way

1475
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:22,060
is provide a vector for cell migration.

1476
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:22,900
So that's an easy way.

1477
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,460
If you have migratory cell types,

1478
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:26,540
that is a great way to get them all moving

1479
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:28,220
in one particular direction.

1480
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:32,140
What's very hard using external electrodes

1481
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:36,020
is to set up standing patterns of voltage across tissue,

1482
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:38,460
which is what the encoding really is.

1483
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:41,620
The bioelectrical code is really spatial patterns

1484
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:44,700
of voltage differences across a field of cells.

1485
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,100
That's actually very difficult to do with electrodes.

1486
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,660
But if you want to do things like move cells around,

1487
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:54,420
that you can do with external currents.

1488
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,220
Okay, so you might have to go as small

1489
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:58,340
as like magnetic nanoparticles or something,

1490
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:01,100
folding around to produce something more interesting

1491
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,540
or sit with the chemicals.

1492
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:04,060
But yeah, I see your point and you're right.

1493
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:05,860
It's a mesoscopic at that point.

1494
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:08,460
Yeah, I mean, but the tools are already here.

1495
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:11,340
So I mean, if we want to set up a pattern

1496
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:14,860
that encodes the correct size and shape of the brain,

1497
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,340
which is not a simple pattern,

1498
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:19,060
we can already do that with drugs.

1499
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:20,820
And if you want a more complex pattern,

1500
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,780
I think what you would do is optogenetics.

1501
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:25,100
So you would lay down a light mask

1502
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,060
that had the exact shape that you want

1503
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:29,460
and your tissue would have on our channel eruptions

1504
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,300
or something like that.

1505
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:34,860
And we've done that for kickstarting tail regeneration

1506
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:35,700
and things like that.

1507
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:39,820
I think right now, that's the easier path for this.

1508
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,100
Fascinating, thank you so much, Michael.

1509
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:43,260
Bleeding edge stuff.

1510
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,600
Cool, thanks.

1511
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,500
We have Artem and then Carl.

1512
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:50,700
Hi there.

1513
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:56,660
Just earlier to Ashish and the Brett's question just now,

1514
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:01,260
I think more operational than a senescence question,

1515
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:05,740
but yeah, is there anything you think

1516
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:10,740
that could be brought from a computer science background

1517
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:16,060
from adjacent fields like microscopy or NGS sequencing

1518
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:21,020
to enrich the stool kit that you mentioned,

1519
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:26,940
both using the drugs to alter the ion channels

1520
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:32,140
and to get access to more of the morphospace, let's say.

1521
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,500
Sure, yeah, absolutely.

1522
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:39,140
I mean, on the microscopy and better dyes

1523
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:41,940
and better imaging of bioelectric states

1524
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,460
in under various conditions is really important.

1525
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:47,180
So nobody's done the basic profiling.

1526
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:48,620
So like physiomic profiling

1527
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:52,460
I'm asking every normal organ in its normal structure,

1528
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,740
what is the bioelectric map, right?

1529
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:55,580
No one's done that.

1530
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,660
I mean, we've done it in very specific cases

1531
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:59,620
for some frogs and worms and things like this,

1532
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:02,660
but in general, that data is extremely sparse.

1533
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:06,860
So lots more imaging using better dyes

1534
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:07,940
that need to be developed

1535
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,760
and just getting those physiomic data sets

1536
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,100
to complement the transcriptomic

1537
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,900
and the genomic data sets is critical.

1538
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:18,780
For NGS, yeah, NGS is good.

1539
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:22,540
I feel like we already have most of the NGS that we need

1540
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:25,260
because almost any tissue, what do we wanna know?

1541
01:04:25,260 --> 01:04:26,580
We wanna know which channels are there

1542
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:28,140
because those are our control knobs.

1543
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:31,340
So pretty much any tissue you can go online

1544
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:34,020
and you can download somebody's profiling

1545
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:36,580
and you can figure out what channels are there.

1546
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:39,180
So that's probably not the rate limiting step

1547
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,020
but the microscopy for sure, yeah.

1548
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,140
Wow, okay, now Carl, you go again.

1549
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:50,100
So outside of the sort of translational aspect here

1550
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,380
of getting things to regenerate

1551
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,980
or fixing problems in the process,

1552
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:59,100
how many labs in the world are studying the basic,

1553
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:00,780
get us more information about this?

1554
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,340
Questions, like you mentioned

1555
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,580
that there's not a whole lot of work

1556
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:05,860
understanding the aging aspect of this.

1557
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:09,220
Like, what changes about the nine to 11 year olds

1558
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:10,640
or whatever that makes their fingertips

1559
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,900
not regenerate versus before?

1560
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:13,740
What's different about the bioelectronite resource

1561
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,140
or what's involved in human liver regeneration

1562
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:19,220
to those networks change over time, things like that?

1563
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:21,740
And the question Allison asks at the end,

1564
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,220
which maybe she was still saving

1565
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:24,460
is what can this group do for you?

1566
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,820
So maybe in relation to that question,

1567
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:31,260
are you doing anything to encourage research labs

1568
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,580
that focus on aging to nudge in this direction?

1569
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:39,580
Yeah, so overall, definitely there are not that many labs.

1570
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:43,180
It's still relatively speaking a small field.

1571
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:47,260
There are people who work in bioelectricity

1572
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,940
and don't know they work in bioelectricity.

1573
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:51,820
And what I mean by that is people who, for example,

1574
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,860
if you study Anderson-Taywell syndrome, right?

1575
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:54,780
And you're a geneticist

1576
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:55,980
and you don't care about bioelectricity,

1577
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:57,820
but you care about Anderson-Taywell syndrome.

1578
01:05:57,820 --> 01:05:58,940
And then eventually you sequence

1579
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:01,020
and you find out that, whoa, it's a potassium channel.

1580
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:02,740
Why do my potassium channel patients

1581
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,380
have craniofacial dysmorphias?

1582
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:06,540
Well, now you're working in developmental bioelectricity,

1583
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:10,100
so there are some folks that sort of get dragged

1584
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:14,380
into it that way, but labs that really focus on this,

1585
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,260
there aren't that many, there really aren't that many.

1586
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:20,460
And in particular, getting money for profiling

1587
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:21,660
is almost impossible, right?

1588
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,020
If you're lucky, if you can from standard sources

1589
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:25,660
and IH and so on, you're lucky

1590
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,660
if you can get funding for functional data,

1591
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:31,220
like I'm going to figure out what these ion channels do

1592
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:33,700
in drosophila development or something like this,

1593
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:37,100
you can do that, but getting money

1594
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:40,380
for a comprehensive profiling project,

1595
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:44,660
the way that they do in, when they have these,

1596
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:46,700
let's figure out what every cell in the brain

1597
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,620
is expressing, right?

1598
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:51,460
And the Allen brain atlas and these kinds of things,

1599
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:53,340
getting funding for that is almost impossible,

1600
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,100
so no one's done it.

1601
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,740
As far as your last question,

1602
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:02,540
yeah, I mean, I would love to get into aging,

1603
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:05,580
I'd love to collaborate with anybody in this community.

1604
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:08,180
Generally speaking, what we've been doing for years now

1605
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:10,860
to try and lower the barrier for other people to get in

1606
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,620
is that we publish a lot of reviews

1607
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:15,420
and a lot of how-to protocols.

1608
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:17,780
So we put everything online as far as if you wanted

1609
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:19,860
to get into this from whatever system,

1610
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,060
whatever you're interested in,

1611
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:24,500
here is like literally step A, B, C,

1612
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,380
how, what do you do next, right?

1613
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:28,980
And so we send out gift baskets of reagents,

1614
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:33,980
we provide all the plasmids, the dye protocols,

1615
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:36,100
all the data interpretation stuff,

1616
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,060
we all have that as out there.

1617
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,180
So anybody that's interested,

1618
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,180
I would be more than happy to help you guys do this.

1619
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,020
It'd be great.

1620
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:45,700
Fantastic, thank you.

1621
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,140
And well, you also mentioned there's a company, right?

1622
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:52,460
And would you make clear quickly at the beginning of the talk?

1623
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,300
And so what's happening with that next?

1624
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,380
What are your next steps in this arena?

1625
01:07:56,380 --> 01:08:00,420
Yeah, it's basically the company is,

1626
01:08:01,860 --> 01:08:05,340
the initial focus is quite narrow, it's limb regeneration.

1627
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:08,020
And so what we're doing is we're testing our various cocktails

1628
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:11,540
in mice using David Kaplan's wearable bioreactor,

1629
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:14,540
short-term application, our ion channel cocktail,

1630
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:17,140
can we trigger limb regeneration?

1631
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:18,380
That's the beginning.

1632
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:23,380
Obviously my dream is to grow this to a kind of fundamental

1633
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:28,260
approach to picking electroseuticals

1634
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:31,020
for all sorts of indications from birth defects

1635
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:34,060
to regenerative medicine to aging to cancer.

1636
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:36,860
But right now it's just about limb regeneration.

1637
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:41,260
Okay, and anything people in this group could do there

1638
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,620
to help, like are you looking for collaborators

1639
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:44,340
with that company or like investors

1640
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:46,980
or is there anything, what are our next steps?

1641
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:51,980
Sure, we're certainly happy to hear from investors.

1642
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:54,780
For sure, anybody that wants to collaborate,

1643
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:56,620
drop me an email and let me know what you do

1644
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:59,380
and we'll see what makes sense.

1645
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:01,780
Yeah, our lab is very collaborative,

1646
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:02,860
we work with all kinds of people.

1647
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:05,580
So for sure, I'd love to hear from this community.

1648
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:08,580
Great, well, it seems like you're already collaborating,

1649
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:12,940
at least with Vadim, be known around Cornus.

1650
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,540
One final thing, which is,

1651
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:17,220
we ask people to submit a longevity channel challenge,

1652
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,220
which you've done.

1653
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:20,260
And this is just another pack

1654
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:21,980
that people can answer this challenge

1655
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:24,980
and actually, again, up to $250 doing.

1656
01:09:24,980 --> 01:09:27,100
So do you want to say maybe a few words

1657
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,860
about the challenge that you submitted?

1658
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:32,660
Yeah, well, I mean, so I wasn't really familiar

1659
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:35,980
with how all this works, but basically,

1660
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:38,380
the big challenge in this field that I see

1661
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:41,660
is just what I think, let's put it this way,

1662
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:45,220
what I think would make a real breakthrough

1663
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:47,860
and move the field forward, kind of a watershed effect,

1664
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:51,580
would be the ability to really image

1665
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:52,780
these bioelectric states

1666
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:55,020
in all sorts of important conditions.

1667
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:57,140
And not because imaging by itself,

1668
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,540
I really focus on functional experiments.

1669
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:01,460
I mean, seeing the beautiful patterns is nice,

1670
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:03,620
but more importantly, are they instructive, right?

1671
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:05,700
Can I show that when you alter the pattern,

1672
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:07,700
the gene expression changes and the anatomy changes,

1673
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:08,540
and we do that.

1674
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:09,820
And so that's what my lab is focused on.

1675
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:12,140
But it would certainly make it much easier

1676
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:15,060
to develop those kind of functional approaches

1677
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:18,620
if we had the baseline data from other model systems,

1678
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:20,940
other conditions, various disease conditions,

1679
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:23,740
various human organs, this would be a real game changer.

1680
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:26,140
So that's what I plan.
