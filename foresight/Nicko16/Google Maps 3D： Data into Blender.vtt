Okay, so in this video I'm going to show you how you can import Google Maps 3D data into

00:05.760 --> 00:06.760
Blender.

00:06.760 --> 00:10.680
And just a word of warning, this process only works on Windows at the moment.

00:10.680 --> 00:14.200
This process was devised by a guy called Ellie Michelle, and if you find the process useful

00:14.200 --> 00:16.120
I'd encourage you to go over here and donate.

00:16.120 --> 00:21.080
He came up with an add-on called Maps Model Importer, which lets you import this special

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
3D file.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.280
And the 3D file is created using a program called RenderDoc, which is an open source

00:26.280 --> 00:31.200
project for capturing 3D buffer, and we're going to import a 3D buffer from Google Maps

00:31.200 --> 00:34.160
on Google Chrome, so you can need Google Chrome as well.

00:34.160 --> 00:39.480
So first of all, you can download the add-on by going down to the releases page, downloading

00:39.480 --> 00:40.760
this file here.

00:40.760 --> 00:44.280
So save that to your add-ons folder, and once your download is finished, you want to head

00:44.280 --> 00:49.360
over to Blender, go to edit preferences, go to the add-ons tab, press install, choose

00:49.360 --> 00:53.400
the place where you saved Maps Model Importer, press install, and you'll just need to check

00:53.400 --> 00:56.080
this little box here to enable the add-on.

00:56.080 --> 01:00.000
Then next you need to install RenderDoc, and if you did it correctly, it should look something

01:00.000 --> 01:01.440
like this when it starts.

01:01.440 --> 01:06.840
Okay, so now for the tricky bit, you need to go over to your Chrome application folder.

01:06.840 --> 01:11.440
For me, it was Cprogramfiles x86 Google Chrome application.

01:11.440 --> 01:16.640
Find your chrome.exe launcher file, right-click on it, go to create a shortcut, and it'll

01:16.640 --> 01:20.920
ask you if you want to put it on your desktop, so if you say yes, then go over to your desktop.

01:20.920 --> 01:26.640
You should find chrome.exe, and if you right-click on it and go to properties, you should see

01:26.640 --> 01:28.120
this section here called target.

01:28.120 --> 01:32.560
We need to change the target, and there's a special bit of text that you need to paste

01:32.560 --> 01:33.560
into here.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.560
I'll put it in the description.

01:34.560 --> 01:39.120
Basically, it's going to add a couple of flags onto the execution of this file so that

01:39.120 --> 01:40.640
it runs in a kind of debug mode.

01:40.640 --> 01:44.680
You can see here there's a few little dashes, and press apply, and you should see that your

01:44.680 --> 01:47.360
icon changes to this command prompt icon.

01:47.760 --> 01:51.880
Then we want to double-click on our shortcut, and you can see that Chrome has launched with

01:51.880 --> 01:57.880
two windows, and one of them has this message that says GPU starting with PID 11256, and

01:57.880 --> 02:02.880
you're going to want to write that number down, and then head over to render.go to file,

02:02.880 --> 02:06.960
inject into process, and then here, I'm going to search for that number that we just wrote

02:06.960 --> 02:07.960
down.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.320
We can see that there is a process with that PID.

02:10.320 --> 02:14.080
I'm going to select it, and then I'm going to press inject, and if you've done it correctly,

02:14.080 --> 02:15.920
you should see connection status established.

02:16.440 --> 02:20.320
Then we can go back to that message, press OK, and Chrome will launch, but it will launch

02:20.320 --> 02:24.840
with this debug mode, and then what you can do is you can go over to Google Maps, satellite

02:24.840 --> 02:29.360
view, go to an interesting location, position your camera so that it can see the thing that

02:29.360 --> 02:30.360
you want to capture.

02:30.360 --> 02:31.960
This is a bit like taking a screenshot.

02:31.960 --> 02:35.800
Go over to render doc, and then if you press capture frames immediately, and then just

02:35.800 --> 02:42.280
wiggle the viewport inside of Chrome, you should see that this little thumbnail pops up, and

02:42.280 --> 02:44.560
this is our captured 3D data.

02:44.600 --> 02:49.280
If it's got these sections here, color pass 2, color pass 3, you've probably done it right,

02:49.280 --> 02:54.440
and so with this selected, we can go to file, save capture as, and then we can save an RDC

02:54.440 --> 02:57.080
file to a location that's convenient for us.

02:57.080 --> 03:01.880
Then we go back to blender, and I'm going to go to file, import, Google Maps capture

03:01.880 --> 03:07.680
RDC, and then we're going to go to the place where I saved my file, press import, and then

03:07.680 --> 03:11.800
if I just delete the default cube, we should see that the geometry has been imported, and

03:11.840 --> 03:16.240
if I go to this button here, the texture mode, we should see that it has an image texture

03:16.240 --> 03:17.240
on it as well.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.720
And that's how you import Google Maps 3D data into blender.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.680
It's a bit of a hack though, but it works.

03:22.680 --> 03:26.880
So one thing you may have noticed is that the models don't import at real world scale,

03:26.880 --> 03:32.440
so what I've done here is I've just imported a base map using blender GIS, and I worked

03:32.440 --> 03:39.000
out that it imports the 3D models 50 times smaller, so 2% of their original size.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.200
So here I'm just going to select my 3D data, press S to scale, and then scale it by a factor

03:44.200 --> 03:49.640
of 50, and then you should see that it matches the real world scale of your blender scene.
