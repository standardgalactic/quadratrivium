0	5760	Okay, so in this video I'm going to show you how you can import Google Maps 3D data into
5760	6760	Blender.
6760	10680	And just a word of warning, this process only works on Windows at the moment.
10680	14200	This process was devised by a guy called Ellie Michelle, and if you find the process useful
14200	16120	I'd encourage you to go over here and donate.
16120	21080	He came up with an add-on called Maps Model Importer, which lets you import this special
21080	22080	3D file.
22080	26280	And the 3D file is created using a program called RenderDoc, which is an open source
26280	31200	project for capturing 3D buffer, and we're going to import a 3D buffer from Google Maps
31200	34160	on Google Chrome, so you can need Google Chrome as well.
34160	39480	So first of all, you can download the add-on by going down to the releases page, downloading
39480	40760	this file here.
40760	44280	So save that to your add-ons folder, and once your download is finished, you want to head
44280	49360	over to Blender, go to edit preferences, go to the add-ons tab, press install, choose
49360	53400	the place where you saved Maps Model Importer, press install, and you'll just need to check
53400	56080	this little box here to enable the add-on.
56080	60000	Then next you need to install RenderDoc, and if you did it correctly, it should look something
60000	61440	like this when it starts.
61440	66840	Okay, so now for the tricky bit, you need to go over to your Chrome application folder.
66840	71440	For me, it was Cprogramfiles x86 Google Chrome application.
71440	76640	Find your chrome.exe launcher file, right-click on it, go to create a shortcut, and it'll
76640	80920	ask you if you want to put it on your desktop, so if you say yes, then go over to your desktop.
80920	86640	You should find chrome.exe, and if you right-click on it and go to properties, you should see
86640	88120	this section here called target.
88120	92560	We need to change the target, and there's a special bit of text that you need to paste
92560	93560	into here.
93560	94560	I'll put it in the description.
94560	99120	Basically, it's going to add a couple of flags onto the execution of this file so that
99120	100640	it runs in a kind of debug mode.
100640	104680	You can see here there's a few little dashes, and press apply, and you should see that your
104680	107360	icon changes to this command prompt icon.
107760	111880	Then we want to double-click on our shortcut, and you can see that Chrome has launched with
111880	117880	two windows, and one of them has this message that says GPU starting with PID 11256, and
117880	122880	you're going to want to write that number down, and then head over to render.go to file,
122880	126960	inject into process, and then here, I'm going to search for that number that we just wrote
126960	127960	down.
127960	130320	We can see that there is a process with that PID.
130320	134080	I'm going to select it, and then I'm going to press inject, and if you've done it correctly,
134080	135920	you should see connection status established.
136440	140320	Then we can go back to that message, press OK, and Chrome will launch, but it will launch
140320	144840	with this debug mode, and then what you can do is you can go over to Google Maps, satellite
144840	149360	view, go to an interesting location, position your camera so that it can see the thing that
149360	150360	you want to capture.
150360	151960	This is a bit like taking a screenshot.
151960	155800	Go over to render doc, and then if you press capture frames immediately, and then just
155800	162280	wiggle the viewport inside of Chrome, you should see that this little thumbnail pops up, and
162280	164560	this is our captured 3D data.
164600	169280	If it's got these sections here, color pass 2, color pass 3, you've probably done it right,
169280	174440	and so with this selected, we can go to file, save capture as, and then we can save an RDC
174440	177080	file to a location that's convenient for us.
177080	181880	Then we go back to blender, and I'm going to go to file, import, Google Maps capture
181880	187680	RDC, and then we're going to go to the place where I saved my file, press import, and then
187680	191800	if I just delete the default cube, we should see that the geometry has been imported, and
191840	196240	if I go to this button here, the texture mode, we should see that it has an image texture
196240	197240	on it as well.
197240	200720	And that's how you import Google Maps 3D data into blender.
200720	202680	It's a bit of a hack though, but it works.
202680	206880	So one thing you may have noticed is that the models don't import at real world scale,
206880	212440	so what I've done here is I've just imported a base map using blender GIS, and I worked
212440	219000	out that it imports the 3D models 50 times smaller, so 2% of their original size.
219000	224200	So here I'm just going to select my 3D data, press S to scale, and then scale it by a factor
224200	229640	of 50, and then you should see that it matches the real world scale of your blender scene.
