Checking Nicko16/Google Maps 3Dï¼š Data into Blender.txt
 Certainly! Here's a summarized step-by-step guide on how to import Google Maps 3D data into Blender, as described in the video:

1. **Install the Add-on:**
   - Download the "Maps Model Importer" add-on from its releases page and save it to your Blender add-ons folder.
   - Open Blender, go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons tab.
   - Press "Install," choose the location where you saved the Maps Model Importer, and enable it by checking the box next to it.

2. **Install RenderDoc:**
   - Download and install RenderDoc from its official website.

3. **Modify Chrome Shortcut:**
   - Navigate to your Chrome application folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application`).
   - Create a shortcut to `chrome.exe` on your desktop.
   - Right-click the new shortcut, select "Properties," and add `--enable-force-glyph-path --disable-gpu-vsync` to the "Target" field.
   - Apply the changes, and you should see the icon change to a command prompt icon.

4. **Capture 3D Data:**
   - Run the modified Chrome shortcut, which will open two windows.
   - In one of the windows, navigate to Google Maps, switch to satellite view, and select an area you want to capture.
   - Open RenderDoc and use the "Inject into Process" feature to inject RenderDoc into the Chrome window that's running in debug mode.
   - Once connected, close the message box in Chrome to let it continue running in debug mode.
   - In Google Maps, move the camera to the desired position and capture the frames using RenderDoc.
   - Save the captured data as an RDC file.

5. **Import into Blender:**
   - Back in Blender, use the "File" menu > "Import" > "Google Maps Capture RDC..." to import the saved RDC file.
   - The 3D model and texture should now appear in your Blender scene.

6. **Adjust Scale:**
   - It's important to note that the imported models are typically 50 times smaller than their real-world scale.
   - To correct this, select the imported model, press "S" to scale, and multiply by 50 (or divide by 0.02) to match the real-world scale.

7. **Finalize:**
   - After scaling, you can add additional details or adjustments as needed in your Blender project.

This process allows you to bring highly detailed 3D terrain data from Google Maps into Blender for further modeling, animation, or rendering. Keep in mind that this method relies on a specific setup and may require some troubleshooting if issues arise.
