0	10560	It is the night of August 23, 1995.
10560	12440	You got your GINCO jeans on?
12440	16280	You brought your Game Boy with you because you have no idea how long this is going to
16280	22160	take and you and your friend are waiting in line at Best Buy with hundreds of other people,
22160	28520	waiting for midnight to strike because that is when the all-new Windows 95 operating system
28600	32280	will be available for purchase on store shelves.
32280	35320	But do you even know why you're here?
35320	37880	Does really anyone for that matter?
37880	39480	What's the big deal?
45400	50960	Microsoft got the whole world excited for its latest operating system, Windows 95,
50960	54680	with its retrospectively famous Start Me Up campaign.
54680	57320	Its marketing was just incredible.
57320	62720	It worked so well, thousands of people waited in line at many retail stores across the world
62720	68360	to buy it, making it the most successful software launch in history.
68360	75320	People knew that Windows 95 was an important milestone, but did they understand why?
75320	80560	Yeah, but also probably not.
80560	84840	What's really interesting about Microsoft's product launch is that it was able to even
84840	89440	mesmerize people that, frankly, didn't really know what was going on.
89440	94000	Today we are going to look at the causes and effects of this great software phenomenon
94000	97800	and explain why Windows 95 was so important.
101600	106440	The seemingly everlasting influence of the Windows 95 operating system can really be
106440	108680	boiled down to three things.
108680	114000	Brilliant marketing, arguably the biggest component, innovative features, and just like
114000	118520	many other incredibly successful things, timing.
118520	124680	It's honestly really easy to overlook Windows 95 as this revolutionary piece of software,
124680	125680	even at the time.
125680	130320	But keep in mind that's not the question this video is answering, but rather why Windows
130320	132320	95 was important.
132320	136040	Being important and revolutionary are different things.
136040	139560	But was Windows 95 revolutionary?
139560	141160	Not really.
141160	143400	Or at least not as much as you think.
143400	149360	Heck, its exorbitant amount of marketing actually brought it a lot of criticism, particularly
149360	151800	from Apple users.
151800	157000	Many of these people scoffed at the features that Windows 95 was boastfully advertising,
157000	160400	and mockingly nicknamed it Macintosh 87.
160400	165240	This is because they claimed that Macintosh did it first almost a decade earlier, and
165240	167320	they actually weren't too far off.
167320	174240	A new feature included in Windows 95 allowed users to name files up to 255 characters long,
174240	177960	a huge improvement to the previous 11 character limit.
177960	183560	The Macintosh had already supported file names as much as 31 characters long since its launch
183560	190560	in 1984, and while 255 characters was much bigger than that, it was argued to be almost
190560	192840	unrealistically big.
193200	197600	Considering that file names more than 120 characters long were extremely uncommon at
197600	203440	the time, Apple users felt that this was just excessive, and unnecessarily adding onto a
203440	206360	feature that Apple had included first.
206360	211920	Basically, this was a feature the Macintosh had for over 10 years, along with a similar
211920	214840	looking GUI that used similar icons.
214840	219140	I mean if you really want to get technical, Macintosh actually copied Xerox, and Windows
219140	222480	just copied it afterwards, but that's a whole other video.
222480	227560	But it didn't stop Apple users at the time from giving Windows 95 some bad PR.
227560	232520	Yeah, the whole Mac vs PC debate is a lot older than you might think.
232520	237560	But Microsoft's incredible advertising serves as a testament for why people still chose
237560	241680	Windows 95 over the already existing Mac OS instead.
241680	248240	Yeah, Windows 95 was similar to the Macintosh, but its marketing gave it better personality.
248240	254600	Computing had an interesting role in the 90s, which was to be as relatable as possible,
254600	260440	to transform from this niche community into something that everybody did.
260440	266640	Computers were soon going to be as relatable and fun as cars or television, and Windows
266640	272440	95 in a lot of ways was the one that took initiative on achieving this goal.
272440	277800	Their commercials were upbeat, exciting, and appealed to the masses using pop culture references
277800	278800	of the time.
278800	282320	This is Jennifer Amiston, I'm Matthew Perry, we're here to see Mr. Bill Gates about a
282320	286380	possible starring role in the video guide to Microsoft Windows 95.
286380	290360	Their main focus was showing the operating system's simplicity and how much the user
290360	295000	could do with such little effort.
295000	300640	Windows 95 was less of a convoluted piece of software, and more like a person, when
300640	306440	in reality, Windows 95 honestly wasn't all that different from its previous version,
306440	307960	Windows 3.1.
307960	313160	Visually, yes, but under the hood, not so much.
313160	317360	With the way these previous versions were marketed, people basically just saw Windows
317360	320440	as DOS wearing a fancy outfit.
320440	323440	Windows 95 also ran on top of DOS.
323440	328560	Only difference was DOS booted into Windows by default, so you didn't notice it.
328560	331080	And of course, the ads wouldn't tell you that.
331080	335920	All this fun advertising excited people, and encouraged them to go out and see what all
335920	341200	the fuss was about, including those that were just getting into computers and had no prior
341200	343160	experience with them.
343160	348160	Consequently, many people weren't even exactly sure why they were in line, but just knew
348160	352740	that it was the start of something big, and that this product was going to soon enrich
352740	355640	their lives in one way or another.
355640	359440	Can the same thing be said about the Macintosh in 1995?
359440	386440	I mean, what did their advertising look like in comparison?
386440	389320	To be honest, which one are you going to buy?
389320	394520	Aside from some criticism that it was just copying the Macintosh, Windows 95 actually
394520	398640	did have some new features that proved to be innovative for the time.
398640	405880	The most notable being, of course, the Start Menu, the main subject of all Windows 95 commercials.
405880	413000	This was a big deal, particularly because it made all the difference when it came to organization.
413000	416840	The Start Menu was essentially the hub of the computer.
416840	422000	All of your files, applications, and system configurations were just a couple of clicks
422000	423100	away.
423100	429000	It was a big improvement on the previous Windows version, 3.1, where users had to use a tool
429000	433360	called Program Manager, which was much more complicated.
433360	440640	This new Start Menu, along with Windows Explorer, another new feature, made Program Manager unnecessary,
440640	444000	when navigating the computer wasn't as much of a hassle.
444000	449120	Again, there was, of course, criticism that this was just a ripoff of Macintosh's Apple
449120	454960	Menu, but the Start Menu was arguably easier to use and more convenient.
454960	460560	They were similar in that they were both system menus that gave the user access to applications,
460560	464880	but the difference is how these applications are displayed.
464880	470480	Many times you had to manually add your preferred applications to the Apple Menu by digging for
470480	473280	it through the actual file system.
473280	478020	Windows Start Menu did this for you, and if you didn't want something there, you could
478020	480520	just remove it at any time.
480520	485520	This was a great setup for non-tech savvy computer users, and saved them an extra step
485520	489920	of navigating an environment that they were completely unfamiliar with.
489920	494560	Compared to the Apple Menu, the Start Menu also just stood out better.
494640	500640	Often, inexperienced Macintosh users would assume that the Menu's icon was just a logo
500640	502720	that didn't do anything.
502720	509040	This would actually be the case in future beta releases of OS X in the year 2000.
509040	513960	Because of this, many users would initially struggle with navigating the machine.
513960	519760	For those who don't know where to start on a Windows machine, it literally tells them.
519760	524640	Another groundbreaking feature that Windows had to offer was the Taskbar.
524640	529880	If you were using multiple programs, it took just one click to switch back and forth between
529880	530880	them.
530880	537200	Much quicker and easier than the application menu on the Macintosh or other operating systems.
537200	542280	Windows 95 also had a great feature known as Plug and Play.
542280	548000	It had a lot of problems, but it was a brilliant concept that would prove to be essential in
548000	550160	future releases.
550160	555200	Rather than having to manually install hardware such as a printer, Windows would detect it
555200	561720	automatically and install the drivers for you, or prompt you to do so with a CD-ROM.
561720	568120	And lastly, arguably the greatest feature of all that Windows 95 had was access to the
568120	569440	internet.
569440	572040	This wasn't inherently revolutionary.
572040	577040	Most mainstream operating systems at the time had this, but it didn't matter.
577040	580800	Because of one thing, timing.
580800	583280	Timing caused Windows Vista to flop.
583280	587960	It caused the pet rock to become popular, along with flagpole sitting.
587960	590760	And in some respects, the Beatles.
590760	596440	So much of something's success can be attributed to just coming out at the right time.
596440	599320	And Windows 95 is no exception.
599320	605400	The 1990s were a very special decade, and that's because, historically, it can arguably
605400	613000	be divided into two different decades, because it has two eras that are so distinct.
613000	620840	In the early 90s, from roughly 1988 to 1994, you have the sort of pre-internet Golden Girls
620840	623800	MTV Grunge era of the 90s.
623800	629480	Still very much influenced by the 1980s, because the decade, in some ways, hasn't really had
629480	631800	much time to identify itself.
631800	638520	It's from around 1996 to 2002, where the 90s are really starting to solidify.
638520	643880	You have an era filled with AOL, boy bands, and a dot-com bubble.
643880	648120	Not that all of these trends are mutually exclusive, but when looking at the decade
648120	652800	through an historical lens, it's clear to see which trends took priority and which
652800	654800	timeframes.
654800	657600	1995 is smack in the middle.
657600	660800	It is the transitioning point between these two eras.
660800	665040	Essentially embodying both characteristics of these periods.
665040	668920	Of course, you might think I sound totally crazy bringing all this stuff up about two
668920	670720	eras colliding.
670720	671720	And you could be right.
671720	675320	I mean, you could really make this argument about any decade.
675320	677840	But the 90s especially.
677840	684160	Just like the 60s was a cultural revolution, the 90s was a technological one.
684160	688960	Defining the exact time an era starts and ends is totally subjective.
688960	694280	But in all honesty, it could be an explanation for people's thoughts and behaviors at the
694280	695280	time.
695280	700320	In 1995, it was clear that the internet was going somewhere big.
700320	704320	It was the year that most people were just getting introduced to it.
704320	710040	And going back to its influential marketing, Windows 95 acted as a friendly gateway to
710040	712080	the world wide web.
712080	715560	You didn't have to be a computer geek to use it.
715560	717520	You could be anybody.
717520	721480	Computer operating systems didn't really do that.
721480	726040	So yeah, Windows 95 wasn't the only OS to support the internet.
726040	729920	But everyone knew it as the OS to support the internet.
729920	733780	By 1999, your grandmother was using the internet.
733780	737600	You could not say the same thing back in 1992.
737600	742960	It's clear that the internet was going to inevitably boom by the end of the 1990s.
742960	747800	Microsoft was just smart enough to be the ones to lead the way.
747800	752960	Windows 95 did not start the growing popularity of the world wide web, but it was part of
752960	753960	it.
753960	757400	It was both the catalyst and the leader.
757400	763340	When seeing the big picture, it makes perfect sense why Windows 95 was so popular and why
763340	766480	it continues to influence us today.
766480	771920	Its marketing allowed personal computers to become even more personal than they already
772920	778760	Making something complicated like an operating system relatable to most people.
778760	784840	All of its design configurations set a precedent for how an operating system should look and
784840	785840	feel.
785840	791480	And its timing was the last ingredient in creating a perfect storm of circumstances that
791480	796320	would transform Windows 95 into this technological phenomenon.
796320	801760	And it's apparent that Microsoft knew this, because they did everything to prepare for
801760	802920	it.
802920	809240	Many features introduced, or at least emphasized in Windows 95, are still seen in many operating
809240	811280	systems today.
811280	817840	Features that likely never need to be changed because they were so convenient and timeless.
817840	823960	Windows 95 was the OS where Microsoft finally found its sweet spot, and all future versions
823960	828560	would essentially just build on top of it and make it better.
828560	834120	And Microsoft has been able to start us up ever since.
834120	836920	What was your experience with Windows 95?
836920	838640	Did you enjoy using it?
838640	840160	Too young to remember?
