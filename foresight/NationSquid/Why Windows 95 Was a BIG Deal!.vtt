00:00.000 --> 00:10.560
It is the night of August 23, 1995.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.440
You got your GINCO jeans on?

00:12.440 --> 00:16.280
You brought your Game Boy with you because you have no idea how long this is going to

00:16.280 --> 00:22.160
take and you and your friend are waiting in line at Best Buy with hundreds of other people,

00:22.160 --> 00:28.520
waiting for midnight to strike because that is when the all-new Windows 95 operating system

00:28.600 --> 00:32.280
will be available for purchase on store shelves.

00:32.280 --> 00:35.320
But do you even know why you're here?

00:35.320 --> 00:37.880
Does really anyone for that matter?

00:37.880 --> 00:39.480
What's the big deal?

00:45.400 --> 00:50.960
Microsoft got the whole world excited for its latest operating system, Windows 95,

00:50.960 --> 00:54.680
with its retrospectively famous Start Me Up campaign.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.320
Its marketing was just incredible.

00:57.320 --> 01:02.720
It worked so well, thousands of people waited in line at many retail stores across the world

01:02.720 --> 01:08.360
to buy it, making it the most successful software launch in history.

01:08.360 --> 01:15.320
People knew that Windows 95 was an important milestone, but did they understand why?

01:15.320 --> 01:20.560
Yeah, but also probably not.

01:20.560 --> 01:24.840
What's really interesting about Microsoft's product launch is that it was able to even

01:24.840 --> 01:29.440
mesmerize people that, frankly, didn't really know what was going on.

01:29.440 --> 01:34.000
Today we are going to look at the causes and effects of this great software phenomenon

01:34.000 --> 01:37.800
and explain why Windows 95 was so important.

01:41.600 --> 01:46.440
The seemingly everlasting influence of the Windows 95 operating system can really be

01:46.440 --> 01:48.680
boiled down to three things.

01:48.680 --> 01:54.000
Brilliant marketing, arguably the biggest component, innovative features, and just like

01:54.000 --> 01:58.520
many other incredibly successful things, timing.

01:58.520 --> 02:04.680
It's honestly really easy to overlook Windows 95 as this revolutionary piece of software,

02:04.680 --> 02:05.680
even at the time.

02:05.680 --> 02:10.320
But keep in mind that's not the question this video is answering, but rather why Windows

02:10.320 --> 02:12.320
95 was important.

02:12.320 --> 02:16.040
Being important and revolutionary are different things.

02:16.040 --> 02:19.560
But was Windows 95 revolutionary?

02:19.560 --> 02:21.160
Not really.

02:21.160 --> 02:23.400
Or at least not as much as you think.

02:23.400 --> 02:29.360
Heck, its exorbitant amount of marketing actually brought it a lot of criticism, particularly

02:29.360 --> 02:31.800
from Apple users.

02:31.800 --> 02:37.000
Many of these people scoffed at the features that Windows 95 was boastfully advertising,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.400
and mockingly nicknamed it Macintosh 87.

02:40.400 --> 02:45.240
This is because they claimed that Macintosh did it first almost a decade earlier, and

02:45.240 --> 02:47.320
they actually weren't too far off.

02:47.320 --> 02:54.240
A new feature included in Windows 95 allowed users to name files up to 255 characters long,

02:54.240 --> 02:57.960
a huge improvement to the previous 11 character limit.

02:57.960 --> 03:03.560
The Macintosh had already supported file names as much as 31 characters long since its launch

03:03.560 --> 03:10.560
in 1984, and while 255 characters was much bigger than that, it was argued to be almost

03:10.560 --> 03:12.840
unrealistically big.

03:13.200 --> 03:17.600
Considering that file names more than 120 characters long were extremely uncommon at

03:17.600 --> 03:23.440
the time, Apple users felt that this was just excessive, and unnecessarily adding onto a

03:23.440 --> 03:26.360
feature that Apple had included first.

03:26.360 --> 03:31.920
Basically, this was a feature the Macintosh had for over 10 years, along with a similar

03:31.920 --> 03:34.840
looking GUI that used similar icons.

03:34.840 --> 03:39.140
I mean if you really want to get technical, Macintosh actually copied Xerox, and Windows

03:39.140 --> 03:42.480
just copied it afterwards, but that's a whole other video.

03:42.480 --> 03:47.560
But it didn't stop Apple users at the time from giving Windows 95 some bad PR.

03:47.560 --> 03:52.520
Yeah, the whole Mac vs PC debate is a lot older than you might think.

03:52.520 --> 03:57.560
But Microsoft's incredible advertising serves as a testament for why people still chose

03:57.560 --> 04:01.680
Windows 95 over the already existing Mac OS instead.

04:01.680 --> 04:08.240
Yeah, Windows 95 was similar to the Macintosh, but its marketing gave it better personality.

04:08.240 --> 04:14.600
Computing had an interesting role in the 90s, which was to be as relatable as possible,

04:14.600 --> 04:20.440
to transform from this niche community into something that everybody did.

04:20.440 --> 04:26.640
Computers were soon going to be as relatable and fun as cars or television, and Windows

04:26.640 --> 04:32.440
95 in a lot of ways was the one that took initiative on achieving this goal.

04:32.440 --> 04:37.800
Their commercials were upbeat, exciting, and appealed to the masses using pop culture references

04:37.800 --> 04:38.800
of the time.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.320
This is Jennifer Amiston, I'm Matthew Perry, we're here to see Mr. Bill Gates about a

04:42.320 --> 04:46.380
possible starring role in the video guide to Microsoft Windows 95.

04:46.380 --> 04:50.360
Their main focus was showing the operating system's simplicity and how much the user

04:50.360 --> 04:55.000
could do with such little effort.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.640
Windows 95 was less of a convoluted piece of software, and more like a person, when

05:00.640 --> 05:06.440
in reality, Windows 95 honestly wasn't all that different from its previous version,

05:06.440 --> 05:07.960
Windows 3.1.

05:07.960 --> 05:13.160
Visually, yes, but under the hood, not so much.

05:13.160 --> 05:17.360
With the way these previous versions were marketed, people basically just saw Windows

05:17.360 --> 05:20.440
as DOS wearing a fancy outfit.

05:20.440 --> 05:23.440
Windows 95 also ran on top of DOS.

05:23.440 --> 05:28.560
Only difference was DOS booted into Windows by default, so you didn't notice it.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.080
And of course, the ads wouldn't tell you that.

05:31.080 --> 05:35.920
All this fun advertising excited people, and encouraged them to go out and see what all

05:35.920 --> 05:41.200
the fuss was about, including those that were just getting into computers and had no prior

05:41.200 --> 05:43.160
experience with them.

05:43.160 --> 05:48.160
Consequently, many people weren't even exactly sure why they were in line, but just knew

05:48.160 --> 05:52.740
that it was the start of something big, and that this product was going to soon enrich

05:52.740 --> 05:55.640
their lives in one way or another.

05:55.640 --> 05:59.440
Can the same thing be said about the Macintosh in 1995?

05:59.440 --> 06:26.440
I mean, what did their advertising look like in comparison?

06:26.440 --> 06:29.320
To be honest, which one are you going to buy?

06:29.320 --> 06:34.520
Aside from some criticism that it was just copying the Macintosh, Windows 95 actually

06:34.520 --> 06:38.640
did have some new features that proved to be innovative for the time.

06:38.640 --> 06:45.880
The most notable being, of course, the Start Menu, the main subject of all Windows 95 commercials.

06:45.880 --> 06:53.000
This was a big deal, particularly because it made all the difference when it came to organization.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.840
The Start Menu was essentially the hub of the computer.

06:56.840 --> 07:02.000
All of your files, applications, and system configurations were just a couple of clicks

07:02.000 --> 07:03.100
away.

07:03.100 --> 07:09.000
It was a big improvement on the previous Windows version, 3.1, where users had to use a tool

07:09.000 --> 07:13.360
called Program Manager, which was much more complicated.

07:13.360 --> 07:20.640
This new Start Menu, along with Windows Explorer, another new feature, made Program Manager unnecessary,

07:20.640 --> 07:24.000
when navigating the computer wasn't as much of a hassle.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.120
Again, there was, of course, criticism that this was just a ripoff of Macintosh's Apple

07:29.120 --> 07:34.960
Menu, but the Start Menu was arguably easier to use and more convenient.

07:34.960 --> 07:40.560
They were similar in that they were both system menus that gave the user access to applications,

07:40.560 --> 07:44.880
but the difference is how these applications are displayed.

07:44.880 --> 07:50.480
Many times you had to manually add your preferred applications to the Apple Menu by digging for

07:50.480 --> 07:53.280
it through the actual file system.

07:53.280 --> 07:58.020
Windows Start Menu did this for you, and if you didn't want something there, you could

07:58.020 --> 08:00.520
just remove it at any time.

08:00.520 --> 08:05.520
This was a great setup for non-tech savvy computer users, and saved them an extra step

08:05.520 --> 08:09.920
of navigating an environment that they were completely unfamiliar with.

08:09.920 --> 08:14.560
Compared to the Apple Menu, the Start Menu also just stood out better.

08:14.640 --> 08:20.640
Often, inexperienced Macintosh users would assume that the Menu's icon was just a logo

08:20.640 --> 08:22.720
that didn't do anything.

08:22.720 --> 08:29.040
This would actually be the case in future beta releases of OS X in the year 2000.

08:29.040 --> 08:33.960
Because of this, many users would initially struggle with navigating the machine.

08:33.960 --> 08:39.760
For those who don't know where to start on a Windows machine, it literally tells them.

08:39.760 --> 08:44.640
Another groundbreaking feature that Windows had to offer was the Taskbar.

08:44.640 --> 08:49.880
If you were using multiple programs, it took just one click to switch back and forth between

08:49.880 --> 08:50.880
them.

08:50.880 --> 08:57.200
Much quicker and easier than the application menu on the Macintosh or other operating systems.

08:57.200 --> 09:02.280
Windows 95 also had a great feature known as Plug and Play.

09:02.280 --> 09:08.000
It had a lot of problems, but it was a brilliant concept that would prove to be essential in

09:08.000 --> 09:10.160
future releases.

09:10.160 --> 09:15.200
Rather than having to manually install hardware such as a printer, Windows would detect it

09:15.200 --> 09:21.720
automatically and install the drivers for you, or prompt you to do so with a CD-ROM.

09:21.720 --> 09:28.120
And lastly, arguably the greatest feature of all that Windows 95 had was access to the

09:28.120 --> 09:29.440
internet.

09:29.440 --> 09:32.040
This wasn't inherently revolutionary.

09:32.040 --> 09:37.040
Most mainstream operating systems at the time had this, but it didn't matter.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.800
Because of one thing, timing.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.280
Timing caused Windows Vista to flop.

09:43.280 --> 09:47.960
It caused the pet rock to become popular, along with flagpole sitting.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.760
And in some respects, the Beatles.

09:50.760 --> 09:56.440
So much of something's success can be attributed to just coming out at the right time.

09:56.440 --> 09:59.320
And Windows 95 is no exception.

09:59.320 --> 10:05.400
The 1990s were a very special decade, and that's because, historically, it can arguably

10:05.400 --> 10:13.000
be divided into two different decades, because it has two eras that are so distinct.

10:13.000 --> 10:20.840
In the early 90s, from roughly 1988 to 1994, you have the sort of pre-internet Golden Girls

10:20.840 --> 10:23.800
MTV Grunge era of the 90s.

10:23.800 --> 10:29.480
Still very much influenced by the 1980s, because the decade, in some ways, hasn't really had

10:29.480 --> 10:31.800
much time to identify itself.

10:31.800 --> 10:38.520
It's from around 1996 to 2002, where the 90s are really starting to solidify.

10:38.520 --> 10:43.880
You have an era filled with AOL, boy bands, and a dot-com bubble.

10:43.880 --> 10:48.120
Not that all of these trends are mutually exclusive, but when looking at the decade

10:48.120 --> 10:52.800
through an historical lens, it's clear to see which trends took priority and which

10:52.800 --> 10:54.800
timeframes.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.600
1995 is smack in the middle.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.800
It is the transitioning point between these two eras.

11:00.800 --> 11:05.040
Essentially embodying both characteristics of these periods.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.920
Of course, you might think I sound totally crazy bringing all this stuff up about two

11:08.920 --> 11:10.720
eras colliding.

11:10.720 --> 11:11.720
And you could be right.

11:11.720 --> 11:15.320
I mean, you could really make this argument about any decade.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.840
But the 90s especially.

11:17.840 --> 11:24.160
Just like the 60s was a cultural revolution, the 90s was a technological one.

11:24.160 --> 11:28.960
Defining the exact time an era starts and ends is totally subjective.

11:28.960 --> 11:34.280
But in all honesty, it could be an explanation for people's thoughts and behaviors at the

11:34.280 --> 11:35.280
time.

11:35.280 --> 11:40.320
In 1995, it was clear that the internet was going somewhere big.

11:40.320 --> 11:44.320
It was the year that most people were just getting introduced to it.

11:44.320 --> 11:50.040
And going back to its influential marketing, Windows 95 acted as a friendly gateway to

11:50.040 --> 11:52.080
the world wide web.

11:52.080 --> 11:55.560
You didn't have to be a computer geek to use it.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.520
You could be anybody.

11:57.520 --> 12:01.480
Computer operating systems didn't really do that.

12:01.480 --> 12:06.040
So yeah, Windows 95 wasn't the only OS to support the internet.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.920
But everyone knew it as the OS to support the internet.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.780
By 1999, your grandmother was using the internet.

12:13.780 --> 12:17.600
You could not say the same thing back in 1992.

12:17.600 --> 12:22.960
It's clear that the internet was going to inevitably boom by the end of the 1990s.

12:22.960 --> 12:27.800
Microsoft was just smart enough to be the ones to lead the way.

12:27.800 --> 12:32.960
Windows 95 did not start the growing popularity of the world wide web, but it was part of

12:32.960 --> 12:33.960
it.

12:33.960 --> 12:37.400
It was both the catalyst and the leader.

12:37.400 --> 12:43.340
When seeing the big picture, it makes perfect sense why Windows 95 was so popular and why

12:43.340 --> 12:46.480
it continues to influence us today.

12:46.480 --> 12:51.920
Its marketing allowed personal computers to become even more personal than they already

12:52.920 --> 12:58.760
Making something complicated like an operating system relatable to most people.

12:58.760 --> 13:04.840
All of its design configurations set a precedent for how an operating system should look and

13:04.840 --> 13:05.840
feel.

13:05.840 --> 13:11.480
And its timing was the last ingredient in creating a perfect storm of circumstances that

13:11.480 --> 13:16.320
would transform Windows 95 into this technological phenomenon.

13:16.320 --> 13:21.760
And it's apparent that Microsoft knew this, because they did everything to prepare for

13:21.760 --> 13:22.920
it.

13:22.920 --> 13:29.240
Many features introduced, or at least emphasized in Windows 95, are still seen in many operating

13:29.240 --> 13:31.280
systems today.

13:31.280 --> 13:37.840
Features that likely never need to be changed because they were so convenient and timeless.

13:37.840 --> 13:43.960
Windows 95 was the OS where Microsoft finally found its sweet spot, and all future versions

13:43.960 --> 13:48.560
would essentially just build on top of it and make it better.

13:48.560 --> 13:54.120
And Microsoft has been able to start us up ever since.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.920
What was your experience with Windows 95?

13:56.920 --> 13:58.640
Did you enjoy using it?

13:58.640 --> 14:00.160
Too young to remember?
