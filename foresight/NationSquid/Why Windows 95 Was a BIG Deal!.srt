1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,560
It is the night of August 23, 1995.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,440
You got your GINCO jeans on?

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,280
You brought your Game Boy with you because you have no idea how long this is going to

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:22,160
take and you and your friend are waiting in line at Best Buy with hundreds of other people,

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,520
waiting for midnight to strike because that is when the all-new Windows 95 operating system

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,280
will be available for purchase on store shelves.

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,320
But do you even know why you're here?

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,880
Does really anyone for that matter?

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,480
What's the big deal?

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,960
Microsoft got the whole world excited for its latest operating system, Windows 95,

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,680
with its retrospectively famous Start Me Up campaign.

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,320
Its marketing was just incredible.

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,720
It worked so well, thousands of people waited in line at many retail stores across the world

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,360
to buy it, making it the most successful software launch in history.

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:15,320
People knew that Windows 95 was an important milestone, but did they understand why?

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,560
Yeah, but also probably not.

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,840
What's really interesting about Microsoft's product launch is that it was able to even

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,440
mesmerize people that, frankly, didn't really know what was going on.

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,000
Today we are going to look at the causes and effects of this great software phenomenon

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,800
and explain why Windows 95 was so important.

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,440
The seemingly everlasting influence of the Windows 95 operating system can really be

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,680
boiled down to three things.

23
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,000
Brilliant marketing, arguably the biggest component, innovative features, and just like

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,520
many other incredibly successful things, timing.

25
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,680
It's honestly really easy to overlook Windows 95 as this revolutionary piece of software,

26
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
even at the time.

27
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,320
But keep in mind that's not the question this video is answering, but rather why Windows

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,320
95 was important.

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,040
Being important and revolutionary are different things.

30
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,560
But was Windows 95 revolutionary?

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,160
Not really.

32
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,400
Or at least not as much as you think.

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,360
Heck, its exorbitant amount of marketing actually brought it a lot of criticism, particularly

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,800
from Apple users.

35
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,000
Many of these people scoffed at the features that Windows 95 was boastfully advertising,

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,400
and mockingly nicknamed it Macintosh 87.

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,240
This is because they claimed that Macintosh did it first almost a decade earlier, and

38
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,320
they actually weren't too far off.

39
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:54,240
A new feature included in Windows 95 allowed users to name files up to 255 characters long,

40
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,960
a huge improvement to the previous 11 character limit.

41
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:03,560
The Macintosh had already supported file names as much as 31 characters long since its launch

42
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:10,560
in 1984, and while 255 characters was much bigger than that, it was argued to be almost

43
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,840
unrealistically big.

44
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,600
Considering that file names more than 120 characters long were extremely uncommon at

45
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,440
the time, Apple users felt that this was just excessive, and unnecessarily adding onto a

46
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,360
feature that Apple had included first.

47
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,920
Basically, this was a feature the Macintosh had for over 10 years, along with a similar

48
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,840
looking GUI that used similar icons.

49
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,140
I mean if you really want to get technical, Macintosh actually copied Xerox, and Windows

50
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,480
just copied it afterwards, but that's a whole other video.

51
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,560
But it didn't stop Apple users at the time from giving Windows 95 some bad PR.

52
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,520
Yeah, the whole Mac vs PC debate is a lot older than you might think.

53
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,560
But Microsoft's incredible advertising serves as a testament for why people still chose

54
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,680
Windows 95 over the already existing Mac OS instead.

55
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,240
Yeah, Windows 95 was similar to the Macintosh, but its marketing gave it better personality.

56
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,600
Computing had an interesting role in the 90s, which was to be as relatable as possible,

57
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,440
to transform from this niche community into something that everybody did.

58
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,640
Computers were soon going to be as relatable and fun as cars or television, and Windows

59
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:32,440
95 in a lot of ways was the one that took initiative on achieving this goal.

60
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,800
Their commercials were upbeat, exciting, and appealed to the masses using pop culture references

61
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
of the time.

62
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,320
This is Jennifer Amiston, I'm Matthew Perry, we're here to see Mr. Bill Gates about a

63
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,380
possible starring role in the video guide to Microsoft Windows 95.

64
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,360
Their main focus was showing the operating system's simplicity and how much the user

65
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,000
could do with such little effort.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,640
Windows 95 was less of a convoluted piece of software, and more like a person, when

67
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,440
in reality, Windows 95 honestly wasn't all that different from its previous version,

68
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,960
Windows 3.1.

69
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,160
Visually, yes, but under the hood, not so much.

70
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,360
With the way these previous versions were marketed, people basically just saw Windows

71
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,440
as DOS wearing a fancy outfit.

72
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Windows 95 also ran on top of DOS.

73
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,560
Only difference was DOS booted into Windows by default, so you didn't notice it.

74
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,080
And of course, the ads wouldn't tell you that.

75
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,920
All this fun advertising excited people, and encouraged them to go out and see what all

76
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,200
the fuss was about, including those that were just getting into computers and had no prior

77
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,160
experience with them.

78
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Consequently, many people weren't even exactly sure why they were in line, but just knew

79
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,740
that it was the start of something big, and that this product was going to soon enrich

80
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,640
their lives in one way or another.

81
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,440
Can the same thing be said about the Macintosh in 1995?

82
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:26,440
I mean, what did their advertising look like in comparison?

83
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,320
To be honest, which one are you going to buy?

84
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,520
Aside from some criticism that it was just copying the Macintosh, Windows 95 actually

85
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,640
did have some new features that proved to be innovative for the time.

86
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:45,880
The most notable being, of course, the Start Menu, the main subject of all Windows 95 commercials.

87
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:53,000
This was a big deal, particularly because it made all the difference when it came to organization.

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,840
The Start Menu was essentially the hub of the computer.

89
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,000
All of your files, applications, and system configurations were just a couple of clicks

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,100
away.

91
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:09,000
It was a big improvement on the previous Windows version, 3.1, where users had to use a tool

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,360
called Program Manager, which was much more complicated.

93
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:20,640
This new Start Menu, along with Windows Explorer, another new feature, made Program Manager unnecessary,

94
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,000
when navigating the computer wasn't as much of a hassle.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,120
Again, there was, of course, criticism that this was just a ripoff of Macintosh's Apple

96
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,960
Menu, but the Start Menu was arguably easier to use and more convenient.

97
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,560
They were similar in that they were both system menus that gave the user access to applications,

98
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,880
but the difference is how these applications are displayed.

99
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,480
Many times you had to manually add your preferred applications to the Apple Menu by digging for

100
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,280
it through the actual file system.

101
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,020
Windows Start Menu did this for you, and if you didn't want something there, you could

102
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,520
just remove it at any time.

103
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,520
This was a great setup for non-tech savvy computer users, and saved them an extra step

104
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,920
of navigating an environment that they were completely unfamiliar with.

105
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,560
Compared to the Apple Menu, the Start Menu also just stood out better.

106
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:20,640
Often, inexperienced Macintosh users would assume that the Menu's icon was just a logo

107
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,720
that didn't do anything.

108
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,040
This would actually be the case in future beta releases of OS X in the year 2000.

109
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,960
Because of this, many users would initially struggle with navigating the machine.

110
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,760
For those who don't know where to start on a Windows machine, it literally tells them.

111
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,640
Another groundbreaking feature that Windows had to offer was the Taskbar.

112
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,880
If you were using multiple programs, it took just one click to switch back and forth between

113
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
them.

114
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,200
Much quicker and easier than the application menu on the Macintosh or other operating systems.

115
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,280
Windows 95 also had a great feature known as Plug and Play.

116
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:08,000
It had a lot of problems, but it was a brilliant concept that would prove to be essential in

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,160
future releases.

118
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,200
Rather than having to manually install hardware such as a printer, Windows would detect it

119
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,720
automatically and install the drivers for you, or prompt you to do so with a CD-ROM.

120
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,120
And lastly, arguably the greatest feature of all that Windows 95 had was access to the

121
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,440
internet.

122
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,040
This wasn't inherently revolutionary.

123
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Most mainstream operating systems at the time had this, but it didn't matter.

124
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,800
Because of one thing, timing.

125
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,280
Timing caused Windows Vista to flop.

126
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,960
It caused the pet rock to become popular, along with flagpole sitting.

127
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,760
And in some respects, the Beatles.

128
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,440
So much of something's success can be attributed to just coming out at the right time.

129
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,320
And Windows 95 is no exception.

130
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:05,400
The 1990s were a very special decade, and that's because, historically, it can arguably

131
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:13,000
be divided into two different decades, because it has two eras that are so distinct.

132
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,840
In the early 90s, from roughly 1988 to 1994, you have the sort of pre-internet Golden Girls

133
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,800
MTV Grunge era of the 90s.

134
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,480
Still very much influenced by the 1980s, because the decade, in some ways, hasn't really had

135
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,800
much time to identify itself.

136
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:38,520
It's from around 1996 to 2002, where the 90s are really starting to solidify.

137
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,880
You have an era filled with AOL, boy bands, and a dot-com bubble.

138
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,120
Not that all of these trends are mutually exclusive, but when looking at the decade

139
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,800
through an historical lens, it's clear to see which trends took priority and which

140
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
timeframes.

141
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,600
1995 is smack in the middle.

142
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,800
It is the transitioning point between these two eras.

143
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,040
Essentially embodying both characteristics of these periods.

144
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,920
Of course, you might think I sound totally crazy bringing all this stuff up about two

145
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,720
eras colliding.

146
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
And you could be right.

147
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,320
I mean, you could really make this argument about any decade.

148
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,840
But the 90s especially.

149
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:24,160
Just like the 60s was a cultural revolution, the 90s was a technological one.

150
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,960
Defining the exact time an era starts and ends is totally subjective.

151
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,280
But in all honesty, it could be an explanation for people's thoughts and behaviors at the

152
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,280
time.

153
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,320
In 1995, it was clear that the internet was going somewhere big.

154
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,320
It was the year that most people were just getting introduced to it.

155
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,040
And going back to its influential marketing, Windows 95 acted as a friendly gateway to

156
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,080
the world wide web.

157
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,560
You didn't have to be a computer geek to use it.

158
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,520
You could be anybody.

159
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,480
Computer operating systems didn't really do that.

160
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,040
So yeah, Windows 95 wasn't the only OS to support the internet.

161
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,920
But everyone knew it as the OS to support the internet.

162
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,780
By 1999, your grandmother was using the internet.

163
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,600
You could not say the same thing back in 1992.

164
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,960
It's clear that the internet was going to inevitably boom by the end of the 1990s.

165
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,800
Microsoft was just smart enough to be the ones to lead the way.

166
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,960
Windows 95 did not start the growing popularity of the world wide web, but it was part of

167
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,960
it.

168
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,400
It was both the catalyst and the leader.

169
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,340
When seeing the big picture, it makes perfect sense why Windows 95 was so popular and why

170
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,480
it continues to influence us today.

171
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,920
Its marketing allowed personal computers to become even more personal than they already

172
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,760
Making something complicated like an operating system relatable to most people.

173
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,840
All of its design configurations set a precedent for how an operating system should look and

174
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
feel.

175
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:11,480
And its timing was the last ingredient in creating a perfect storm of circumstances that

176
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,320
would transform Windows 95 into this technological phenomenon.

177
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,760
And it's apparent that Microsoft knew this, because they did everything to prepare for

178
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,920
it.

179
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:29,240
Many features introduced, or at least emphasized in Windows 95, are still seen in many operating

180
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,280
systems today.

181
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:37,840
Features that likely never need to be changed because they were so convenient and timeless.

182
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:43,960
Windows 95 was the OS where Microsoft finally found its sweet spot, and all future versions

183
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,560
would essentially just build on top of it and make it better.

184
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,120
And Microsoft has been able to start us up ever since.

185
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,920
What was your experience with Windows 95?

186
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,640
Did you enjoy using it?

187
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,160
Too young to remember?
