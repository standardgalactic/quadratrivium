Thank you to Ren for supporting PBS.

00:03.440 --> 00:07.600
In around four and a half billion years, the Andromeda Galaxy and their own Milky Way

00:07.600 --> 00:14.240
will finish their long mutual plummet. On a first grazing pass, the delicate spiral arms will be

00:14.240 --> 00:20.160
yanked almost out of their sockets. Perhaps their denizens will look back with relief

00:20.160 --> 00:26.400
as the dislocated galaxies retreat on their future night skies. But then they'll pause

00:26.400 --> 00:31.760
for a hundred thousand year eye blink before falling back together. In a series of whirling

00:31.760 --> 00:36.720
collisions, all spiral structure will be obliterated, gas will be compacted to produce

00:36.720 --> 00:42.560
waves of supernovae, and the giant milk-dromeda galaxy will have been born.

00:42.560 --> 00:47.440
The event I just described will happen as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow.

00:47.440 --> 00:52.080
We know this because we've calculated the chaotic gravitational and hydrodynamic

00:52.080 --> 00:58.880
interactions of countless stars and gas and dark matter particles over billions of future years.

00:59.840 --> 01:05.920
And simulations of galaxy collisions are just the beginning. We routinely simulate the universe

01:05.920 --> 01:12.320
on all of its scales, from planets to large fractions of the cosmos. Today we're going to

01:12.320 --> 01:19.440
see how it's possible to build a universe in a computer, and to see whether there's a limit

01:19.440 --> 01:21.200
to what we can simulate.

01:26.640 --> 01:31.840
In 1941, the Swedish astronomer Erik Holmberg conducted what was probably the first

01:31.840 --> 01:37.760
simulation of the universe. Right when the first programmable computers were being assembled,

01:38.400 --> 01:45.840
but Holmberg didn't use a computer, he arrayed 37 light bulbs on a plane, each one representing

01:45.840 --> 01:51.760
billions of stars in a spiral galaxy disk. The light from each bulb was its gravity,

01:51.760 --> 01:56.080
felt more strongly close to the bulb, and dropping away with a square of distance,

01:56.080 --> 02:02.640
just like gravity. At any point on the disk, a galvanic cell could determine in which direction

02:02.640 --> 02:08.000
the intensity of light was strongest. So the simulation went like this. Holmberg started with

02:08.000 --> 02:13.360
a pair of these light bulb galaxies next to each other, with the motion of each bulb existing

02:13.360 --> 02:18.560
only as a note on a piece of paper. He would then measure the light at each bulb,

02:18.560 --> 02:24.640
which told him the sum gravitational pull on that group of stars. He'd then adjust the

02:24.640 --> 02:31.040
velocities of all according to Newton's laws. Finally, he'd allow time to tick forward. He'd

02:31.040 --> 02:35.680
move the bulbs according to their new velocities. Then from that new configuration he'd start

02:35.680 --> 02:42.320
the process again. And so the two galaxies collided. Just as with our modern supercomputer

02:42.320 --> 02:48.160
simulations, he witnessed the destruction of the disks, the throwing off of tidal streams,

02:48.160 --> 02:55.280
and the formation of an elliptical galaxy. Holmberg's experiment was ingenious. But why go to all this

02:55.280 --> 03:01.040
effort? Since the time of Isaac Newton, it had been possible to write down equations describing

03:01.040 --> 03:06.240
the trajectories of a pair of massive bodies moving in each other's gravitational fields.

03:07.040 --> 03:12.240
And then to solve those equations to find their positions at any time in the future.

03:12.240 --> 03:18.560
But note that I said pairs of bodies. This only works for two objects. For three or more bodies,

03:18.560 --> 03:23.600
there is no simple set of equations describing their future evolution under gravity.

03:24.400 --> 03:28.080
This is the so-called three-body problem, which we've discussed in the past.

03:28.880 --> 03:34.240
The three-body problem doesn't have any analytical solution, no simple master equations,

03:34.240 --> 03:37.840
which is why Holmberg had to solve the problem with light bulbs.

03:38.720 --> 03:43.680
Holmberg did what we call a numerical calculation, in which an impossibly complex

03:43.680 --> 03:48.960
computation is broken down into a series of much simpler steps. And this particular type

03:48.960 --> 03:55.760
of numerical calculation is called an n-body simulation. In an n-body simulation, Newton's

03:55.760 --> 04:01.120
laws of motion and gravity are applied over a series of time steps. Each step is short enough

04:01.200 --> 04:07.440
that we can assume that the global gravitational field is constant. It only changes in the next step,

04:07.440 --> 04:12.720
after all the particles have made their moves. The predictions of these n-body simulations

04:12.720 --> 04:19.120
can be as accurate as you like, as long as you make the time steps small enough. And I would hope so,

04:19.120 --> 04:23.760
because this is essentially how we calculate the trajectories that place people on the moon or

04:23.760 --> 04:30.320
land robots on comets. For simulating a solar system, this method is pretty reasonable. In fact,

04:30.320 --> 04:36.080
the room-sized computer used to calculate the Apollo trajectories had about the computing power

04:36.080 --> 04:41.600
of your smartphone. But if we want realistic simulations of, say, a galaxy with its billions

04:41.600 --> 04:48.240
of stars, we need to do a bit better. Fortunately, computing power has improved somewhat since

04:48.240 --> 04:54.080
Holmberg or the Apollo missions. But actually, it's improved nowhere near enough to do n-body

04:54.080 --> 04:59.520
simulations of entire galaxies using the method that I described. Let's think about what this

04:59.520 --> 05:06.240
computation really needs. In the simplest type of n-body simulation, you need to compute the effect

05:06.240 --> 05:13.120
of every particle on every other particle. So if there are n-particles, that's n-squared

05:13.120 --> 05:18.480
calculations. For a modern one million particle simulation of, say, a star cluster, that's a

05:18.480 --> 05:23.600
trillion computations per time step. The real challenge in astrophysics is that we often have

05:23.600 --> 05:29.440
to deal with huge ranges in scale. For example, in a cosmological simulation, we're trying to

05:29.440 --> 05:35.360
watch the detailed formation of individual galaxies, as well as the evolution of giant clusters of

05:35.360 --> 05:41.600
galaxies. But if we keep enough precision to get the fine structure, it's computationally impossible

05:41.600 --> 05:47.600
to also produce a large enough volume to get the larger scales. To do these simulations,

05:47.600 --> 05:52.720
astrophysicists have to come up with some ingenious tricks. Perhaps the most important

05:52.720 --> 05:58.320
is to avoid having to consider every single particle pair. Remember, the strength of gravity

05:58.320 --> 06:03.440
drops off with distance squared. For nearby particles, it's important to consider every

06:03.440 --> 06:08.880
individual interaction. But for more distant locations, it's okay to clump particles together

06:08.880 --> 06:14.080
and consider only their sum gravitational effect. One of the original approaches to doing this is

06:14.080 --> 06:19.440
a so-called tree code. It works like this. You start with a volume full of particles,

06:19.440 --> 06:25.120
each with its starting position and velocity. Now, divide up the volume into eight sub-cubes,

06:25.120 --> 06:31.040
then divide each of these into eight more, and so on. You stop dividing at any given part of the

06:31.040 --> 06:38.320
volume when there is no more than one particle per cube in that part. Next, you run an n-body

06:38.320 --> 06:43.760
simulation by calculating the sum gravitational pull on each given particle. But now you have

06:43.760 --> 06:48.640
a shortcut. When you calculate the effect from distant locations, you don't do it for each

06:48.640 --> 06:54.000
particle. Instead, you do it for all particles inside one of these cubes. The larger the distance,

06:54.000 --> 06:58.560
the larger the cube you can use. Now, this sounds like a complicated process, but now the number

06:58.560 --> 07:05.520
of calculations that you need to do goes down from n squared to n times log n, which for large

07:05.520 --> 07:12.000
particle numbers is much, much faster. Another approach is the particle mesh method, in which

07:12.000 --> 07:17.600
particles are converted into a density distribution and a gravitational potential across the grid.

07:17.600 --> 07:22.640
The force at each point can then be solved using Fourier transform methods, which can

07:22.640 --> 07:29.840
be very fast. Adaptive particle meshes can be used to add higher resolution when needed,

07:29.840 --> 07:36.320
say where the stars have higher density or structure. Modern mesh codes also do classic

07:36.320 --> 07:42.000
particle-particle interactions at short ranges to improve accuracy at small scales. These mesh

07:42.000 --> 07:47.120
codes are useful for systems of particles interacting under gravity, but they also work

07:47.120 --> 07:53.440
for another really important astrophysical situation, flowing gas. The universe started

07:53.440 --> 07:59.200
as an ocean of gas a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang. That gas is still everywhere.

07:59.200 --> 08:05.200
It flows into galaxies from beyond where it rides the disk, fragments and collapses into stars.

08:05.200 --> 08:10.480
It forms whirlpools and jets around new stars and black holes. All of these processes are key

08:10.480 --> 08:16.560
parts of galaxy evolution and of star and planet formation, and so we'd better be able to simulate

08:16.560 --> 08:23.360
this too. Now we call these hydrodynamic simulations. They simulate the flow of gas

08:23.360 --> 08:29.120
using the equations of fluid dynamics. Particle mesh approaches can do this,

08:29.120 --> 08:33.600
but these days it's more common to use an approach called smoothed particle hydrodynamics,

08:33.600 --> 08:41.280
or SPH. SPH codes don't use a rigid grid, but rather they track tracer particles within the

08:41.280 --> 08:47.120
fluid. Those particles effectively make up a constantly shifting grid. In astrophysics, SPH

08:47.120 --> 08:53.360
codes are used to simulate the flows of gas in galaxies and around quasars, used to simulate star

08:53.360 --> 08:59.680
and planet formation, and even star and planet destruction in collisions or supernovae. SPH

08:59.680 --> 09:05.520
can even be used to do galaxy formation where the stars themselves are treated as a type of fluid.

09:05.520 --> 09:11.920
In practice, modern simulations often use an amalgam of these methods. For example, SPH for

09:11.920 --> 09:18.320
large-scale flows and particle-particle n-body for small-scale interactions. Astrophysicists

09:18.320 --> 09:23.840
often inject all sorts of other physics into their simulations. In your galaxy simulation,

09:23.840 --> 09:30.560
you might need a separate prescription to describe how stars age and die. In your quasar disk,

09:30.640 --> 09:36.080
you need to simulate separately how light travels through the hot plasma, and don't get me started

09:36.080 --> 09:41.360
about the complexity of including magnetic fields or of Einstein's general relativity when the

09:41.360 --> 09:46.800
gravitational field becomes very strong. With the techniques now available, using parallelised

09:46.800 --> 09:54.160
code on modern computing clusters, we can compute some pretty insane simulations. We can see how

09:54.160 --> 10:00.080
stars form in multitudes from collapsing gas clouds, and how planets then coalesce in the

10:00.080 --> 10:06.800
disks surrounding those stars. We can watch as galaxies form with gas and dark matter interacting

10:06.800 --> 10:12.960
to produce waves of star formation and supernovae, settling into spiral structures just like we see

10:12.960 --> 10:19.680
in the real universe. And then we have cosmological simulations, which create entire virtual universes,

10:20.240 --> 10:25.040
from the moment the first atoms formed to the modern day. One of the most famous is the

10:25.040 --> 10:30.640
Millennium Simulation from the Max Planck Institute in Germany. It simulated a 13 billion

10:30.640 --> 10:37.280
light-year-wide cube containing over 300 billion particles, each representing a billion sun's

10:37.280 --> 10:43.680
worth of dark matter. But the current largest cosmological simulation is Abacus Summit,

10:43.680 --> 10:49.600
which just last year simulated 70 trillion particles on the supercomputers at the Center

10:49.600 --> 10:57.440
for Computational Astrophysics in New York. So how far can all of this go? Can we ever simulate

10:57.440 --> 11:02.480
a real universe in which creatures evolve that can themselves simulate universes?

11:03.440 --> 11:10.320
In fact, could we be such creatures? Probably not. None of these simulations contain the full

11:10.320 --> 11:14.560
information of an actual universe or even a tiny part of it. As we discussed recently,

11:14.560 --> 11:19.200
a full quantum description of the world contains unthinkably more information than is contained

11:19.200 --> 11:26.000
in a typical simulation, which just tracks particle positions and velocities. No conceivable technology

11:26.000 --> 11:32.080
could fully simulate a quantum universe, except perhaps a cosmologically sized quantum computer,

11:32.640 --> 11:38.240
which is kind of what the universe is anyway. We've talked about this simulation and hypothesis

11:38.320 --> 11:43.520
stuff before, and maybe we'll come back to it. For now, let's just be proud of the science

11:43.520 --> 11:48.880
that we can get from modern simulations, because we've come an awful long way since Eric Holmberg

11:48.880 --> 11:54.640
pushed some light bulbs around on his table. And the fidelity and size of our simulations will

11:54.640 --> 12:00.240
only get better as computing power continues its exponential growth and as we invent better and

12:00.240 --> 12:06.480
better algorithms. Perhaps there is no limit to what we can learn about the outside universe by

12:06.480 --> 12:13.040
rebuilding it inside our computers and then peering into that simulated space time.

12:13.680 --> 12:19.440
Thank you to Ren for supporting PBS. Ren is a website where you calculate your carbon footprint,

12:19.440 --> 12:24.880
then offset it by funding projects that plant trees, protect rainforests, and suck carbon from

12:24.880 --> 12:30.160
the sky. By answering a few questions about your lifestyle, you can find out your carbon footprint

12:30.160 --> 12:36.320
and how you can reduce it. No one can reduce their carbon footprint to zero, so you can offset

12:36.320 --> 12:41.840
what you have left after reducing. Subscribers receive monthly updates from the tree planting,

12:41.840 --> 12:47.200
rainforest protection, and carbon removal projects they support. You can get to see

12:47.200 --> 12:52.480
the trees you planted and what your money is spent on. You can learn more about Ren's

12:52.480 --> 12:54.480
