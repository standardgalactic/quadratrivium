Thank you to NordVPN for supporting PBS.

00:03.120 --> 00:07.680
It's about time we discussed an obscure concept in physics that may be more fundamental

00:07.680 --> 00:11.680
than energy and entropy, and perhaps time itself.

00:11.680 --> 00:12.840
Ready?

00:12.840 --> 00:13.840
Action.

00:18.560 --> 00:22.640
In order to wrench the laws of physics from the reluctant clutches of nature,

00:22.640 --> 00:27.600
we need to watch for clues, patterns in its behaviour that can reveal deeper truths.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.000
Here's an example.

00:29.080 --> 00:34.280
Around 40 AD, Heron of Alexandria, noticed that when light moves between two points,

00:34.280 --> 00:38.200
out of all possible paths between them, it follows the shortest one.

00:38.200 --> 00:43.400
He proposed what you might call a principle of least distance to define the path of light.

00:44.200 --> 00:47.000
Of course, we now know that light doesn't always travel in a straight line,

00:47.000 --> 00:50.840
like when it's refracted by glass or travelling through a gravitational field.

00:50.840 --> 00:55.800
It took a millennium and a half following Heron for Pierre de Fermat to propose a solution

00:55.800 --> 00:57.640
for the case of refraction.

00:57.640 --> 01:03.160
What if light didn't travel the path of least distance, but rather of least time?

01:03.160 --> 01:08.440
If light changes speed between media, then the fastest trajectory is no longer a straight line.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.480
With this principle of least time, Fermat was able to explain all of the field of optics.

01:15.480 --> 01:19.960
It seemed as if we'd stumbled upon a powerful guiding pattern in nature,

01:20.600 --> 01:21.960
minimising principles.

01:22.680 --> 01:27.320
What if there was a similar property that could be minimised to determine the trajectories

01:27.320 --> 01:28.760
of matter as well as light?

01:29.560 --> 01:33.240
There were some efforts, for example, Euler considered properties involving

01:33.240 --> 01:35.880
momentum and kinetic energy, but to no avail.

01:36.680 --> 01:41.560
In the meantime, Isaac Newton came up with his laws of motion, which gave us the

01:41.560 --> 01:45.640
instant and miraculous power to explain the motion of all particles in the universe.

01:46.200 --> 01:51.720
To do this, all you needed to do was know the exact vector forces on each body at

01:51.720 --> 01:56.040
each time, which lets you calculate that body's exact vector position,

01:56.040 --> 01:58.760
velocity and accelerations at each time.

01:59.560 --> 02:03.560
That's doable for, say, a ball flying through the air, but it gets, frankly,

02:03.560 --> 02:05.960
pretty hellish for complicated systems.

02:06.600 --> 02:11.400
So maybe we were still in the market for a simple guiding principle after all.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.840
It was Joseph Louis Lagrange who found that principle.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.240
Consider again the ball flying through the air.

02:17.240 --> 02:21.240
We can describe that motion without the painful vectors if we use energy.

02:21.720 --> 02:25.080
The ball starts out moving fast, it has a lot of kinetic energy,

02:25.080 --> 02:29.480
which it trades for potential energy as it rises and then back to kinetic as it falls.

02:30.280 --> 02:34.920
If you need a refresher on the energy stuff, check out our previous video when you're done here.

02:35.800 --> 02:39.720
You can figure out a lot just using energy like the maximum height the ball will reach,

02:39.720 --> 02:44.120
but because energy doesn't include directional information, vectors,

02:44.120 --> 02:50.040
it seems that you shouldn't be able to determine the exact path, except you can.

02:50.040 --> 02:54.600
Lagrange realized that a particular combination of kinetic and potential energy

02:54.600 --> 02:58.200
had the same minimizing property as does time for the path of light.

02:58.840 --> 03:02.680
He found that the ball will always follow the path that minimizes

03:02.680 --> 03:06.680
the timed average difference between these energies.

03:06.680 --> 03:10.120
In other words, add up the difference between kinetic and potential energy

03:10.120 --> 03:13.560
at all time steps during the flight and you get a number.

03:14.440 --> 03:18.040
Then try the same for any other path that you can imagine.

03:18.040 --> 03:23.640
The result will come out higher for every path other than the path that the ball actually travels.

03:24.520 --> 03:27.640
Lagrange called this new quantity the action.

03:28.520 --> 03:32.920
Formally, it's the integral over time of the kinetic minus potential energies,

03:33.560 --> 03:37.640
and that difference in energies itself got the name Lagrangian,

03:37.640 --> 03:41.480
which itself turns out to be an enormously important and useful quantity.

03:41.480 --> 03:47.160
Lagrange proposed that everything in nature happens in such a way that action is always

03:47.160 --> 03:51.080
minimized, and so was discovered the principle of least action.

03:51.800 --> 03:56.600
A century later, William Hamilton made the important correction that action

03:56.600 --> 03:59.240
is always minimized or maximized.

03:59.800 --> 04:04.440
Here's an imaginary graph of how the action can change between paths.

04:04.440 --> 04:08.200
You get paths where it's at its lowest and at its highest.

04:08.760 --> 04:14.200
Moving objects tend to choose paths where the variation of the action between nearby paths

04:14.280 --> 04:19.080
doesn't change much. In other words, where the slope of this curve is zero,

04:19.080 --> 04:21.880
and that's true at both the minima and maxima.

04:21.880 --> 04:25.560
Most of the time it's the minimum, which is why people still call this the principle of

04:25.560 --> 04:29.640
least action, but others call it the stationary action principle.

04:29.640 --> 04:33.960
If the principle of least action is true, then it should be possible to figure out the path

04:33.960 --> 04:38.440
that any object will take between two points as long as you can find a way to determine

04:38.440 --> 04:45.320
which has the minimum action. That sounds hard, but thankfully Lagrange and Euler already did

04:45.320 --> 04:50.680
most of the work for us by finding the Euler-Lagrange equations, allowing both physics students

04:50.680 --> 04:53.400
and nature to minimize their action.

04:53.400 --> 04:58.120
The principle of least action, in combination with the Euler-Lagrange equations, leads to

04:58.120 --> 05:03.880
Lagrangian mechanics. When you study Newton's mechanics and then move on to Lagrangian mechanics,

05:03.880 --> 05:09.560
it seems almost like a miracle. The hellishly complex equations needed to solve problems using

05:09.560 --> 05:17.000
pure Newton seem to just melt away into much simpler forms. This simplicity comes from the fact

05:17.000 --> 05:22.760
that with Lagrangian mechanics we can dispense with forces and vectors in general and only

05:22.760 --> 05:28.440
consider the energies. The principle of least action is so powerful that it really seems like

05:28.440 --> 05:33.800
it must be telling us something deep about the universe. But what? It's hard to interpret

05:33.960 --> 05:39.960
what this action property really signifies. Well, if it really is so fundamental, then it should

05:39.960 --> 05:44.920
apply well beyond classical mechanics and into our modern theories, in particular general

05:44.920 --> 05:50.840
relativity and quantum mechanics, and perhaps in these we'll find clues as to what the action

05:50.840 --> 05:55.400
is really about. Let's start with Einstein's general theory of relativity, which as we've

05:55.400 --> 06:00.360
discussed before, describes the force of gravity in terms of the bending of the fabric of space and

06:00.360 --> 06:06.680
time. One of Einstein's motivations in developing general relativity was the fact that Newtonian

06:06.680 --> 06:12.840
mechanics failed to correctly predict the orbit of Mercury. If you calculate that orbit using

06:12.840 --> 06:19.240
the Einstein equations in their full glory and full gory detail, you get the right answer. But you

06:19.240 --> 06:23.960
don't even need to go that far. If the principle of least action really is a fundamental law,

06:23.960 --> 06:29.240
then there should be a relativistic version of the action that we can minimize to find Mercury's

06:29.240 --> 06:34.440
orbit. After all, planets trade between potential and kinetic energy as they move around in their

06:34.440 --> 06:39.160
orbits just like the ball. It turns out that we only need to make a couple of relativistic

06:39.160 --> 06:45.320
corrections to do this. The most important is writing the Lagrangian as a function of something

06:45.320 --> 06:51.640
called proper time. In relativity, clocks run at different rates depending on things like relative

06:51.640 --> 06:56.280
speed and position in a gravitational field. Proper time is the time that an object will

06:56.280 --> 07:02.520
perceive in its own reference frame. If you plug the relativistic Lagrangian into the Euler-Lagrange

07:02.520 --> 07:09.240
equation, you get equations of motion correctly describing the orbit of Mercury around the sun.

07:09.240 --> 07:16.600
This shows us that the principle of least action holds up in GR, but it reveals a lot more. First,

07:16.600 --> 07:22.760
it means that Lagrangian mechanics based on this principle can be made to be Lorentz invariant.

07:22.760 --> 07:27.960
It gives equations of motion that are valid even in the shifting frames of Einstein's relativity,

07:27.960 --> 07:33.000
and we also start to learn something about the nature of the action. Once we apply the relativistic

07:33.000 --> 07:39.480
corrections, the action simplifies into just an integral over proper time. Let's take a moment

07:39.480 --> 07:47.080
to think about that, before action was a somewhat vague notion of change in energy. But working with

07:47.080 --> 07:53.400
a more precise model of the universe, we see action is much easier to understand. Action

07:53.400 --> 07:58.920
is now just how much time is perceived by an observer in their own frame of reference.

07:59.560 --> 08:05.400
All objects moving through spacetime move through paths that minimize the time measured

08:05.400 --> 08:10.120
on that path. Remember that Fermat figured out that light always travels the path that

08:10.120 --> 08:15.400
minimizes its travel time, the principle of least time. Well, it turns out that this is just a special

08:15.480 --> 08:21.720
case of a principle of least proper time. The reason for this is that in the classical limit,

08:21.720 --> 08:27.480
proper time becomes kinetic minus potential energy for objects with mass. But for objects

08:27.480 --> 08:33.240
without mass, like light, proper time and time are the same. Okay, it seems like we're getting

08:33.240 --> 08:38.680
somewhere. Let's see if quantum mechanics will get us any deeper, or perhaps just make everything

08:38.680 --> 08:43.720
more confusing. Let's start with the famous double slit experiment as we so often do when

08:43.720 --> 08:48.840
talking quantum mechanics. In it, a stream of quantum particles are launched at a barrier with

08:48.840 --> 08:53.640
two slits cut in it. When the stream reaches a detector screen on the other side, the individual

08:53.640 --> 08:58.440
particles make individual spots, but over time the spots make out this series of bands and

08:58.440 --> 09:03.000
interference pattern. The quantum interpretation of this is that the particle travels between

09:03.000 --> 09:07.960
the source and the screen, not as a particle with a well-defined trajectory, but as a quantum

09:07.960 --> 09:13.080
wave function that represents all possible paths that it could take. The wave function at the screen

09:13.080 --> 09:18.280
represents the range of possible final locations for those paths, with some being more probable

09:18.280 --> 09:24.120
than others. The particle that appears to randomly select a position from that distribution, but

09:24.120 --> 09:28.840
there seems to be a conflict here. The principle of least action says that a particle will always

09:28.840 --> 09:34.840
land where the action of the trajectory is at a minimum or maximum. That should correspond

09:34.840 --> 09:40.360
only to the central points of those bands. However, we see particles landing at every

09:40.360 --> 09:44.760
location in between, albeit with more likelihood the closer you get to these

09:44.760 --> 09:49.640
action stationary points. So perhaps action isn't as fundamental as we thought it was,

09:50.520 --> 09:57.160
or perhaps this is telling us something more about what the action really is. Paul Dirac very

09:57.160 --> 10:03.800
nearly figured this out. He realized that a quantum analog of the action existed that was

10:03.800 --> 10:09.720
related to the integrated time evolution of the wave function, and he realized that this quantity

10:09.720 --> 10:14.440
should result in destructive interference in most places, like the dark bands in the

10:14.440 --> 10:19.320
double slit experiment. It would lead to constructive interference only where this

10:19.320 --> 10:25.400
quantum action varied slowly, near its stationary points, just like with classical action.

10:26.280 --> 10:30.600
But the real action hero of this story is Richard Feynman.

10:31.320 --> 10:36.200
Remember that the action tells us about a particle's history along some hypothetical path?

10:36.280 --> 10:40.520
Feynman realized that the path of a quantum object could be determined by adding together

10:40.520 --> 10:47.400
all possible paths that particles could take weighted by this quantum action. In this case,

10:47.400 --> 10:51.160
the quantum action doesn't come from adding up kinetic minus potential energy,

10:51.160 --> 10:58.040
nor the proper time. Instead, it effectively calculates the phase shift that a particle picks up

10:58.040 --> 11:04.360
along each path towards its destination. Then it adds the phases of all conceivable paths to

11:04.360 --> 11:09.720
that destination. We find that the most likely destinations are those where the phases line

11:09.720 --> 11:15.320
up, constructively interfere. This is Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics,

11:15.320 --> 11:20.360
and it exactly reproduces the predictions of previous versions of quantum mechanics,

11:20.360 --> 11:25.160
for example Schrodinger's wave mechanics, that talks about the evolution of a single wave function.

11:25.880 --> 11:30.760
This is analogous to how Lagrangian mechanics reproduced Newton's mechanics,

11:30.760 --> 11:37.000
and it's no coincidence, because the path integral is the quantum analog of the principle

11:37.000 --> 11:43.000
of least action. So what does this tell us about the action? Well, the path integral tells us that

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
a particular final destination is likely if the phases of the many paths that could lead to that

11:49.000 --> 11:55.240
destination line up. Away from those special points, very tiny changes in the path lead to rapid

11:55.240 --> 12:00.920
changes in the phase, causing those paths to cancel out. As Dirac started to guess, particles

12:00.920 --> 12:07.080
tend to end up near the stationary points of the quantum action. In the path integral, this happens

12:07.080 --> 12:13.800
for paths that take the shortest path, but not the shortest path through space, the shortest path

12:13.800 --> 12:19.880
through something called configuration space. And this configuration space is what ties all of this

12:19.960 --> 12:25.800
together. Configuration space is the space of all possible trajectories given our object's

12:25.800 --> 12:31.240
constraints. In the case of the ball, configuration space refers to all the places the ball could

12:31.240 --> 12:37.320
reach with its current potential and kinetic energies. When we take this to relativity, we see

12:37.320 --> 12:43.320
that the configuration space becomes configuration spacetime, where the shortest path minimizes

12:43.320 --> 12:49.160
proper time. In quantum mechanics, configuration space could mean phase space, which is the space

12:49.160 --> 12:56.040
of all possible positions and momenta. Or it could be the more general state space, representing

12:56.040 --> 13:01.560
all the quantum states that a system could evolve through. The application of the quantum

13:01.560 --> 13:07.240
action principle to the evolution through quantum states underpins modern quantum theory.

13:08.040 --> 13:14.200
Back to Paul Dirac, just for a moment. His eponymous equation was derived to describe

13:14.200 --> 13:21.240
the quantum evolution of the electron. Well, it turns out that this equation is just the Lagrangian

13:21.240 --> 13:28.760
for a spin half quantum field. And there's a Lagrangian for each quantum field, which describes

13:28.760 --> 13:36.680
how that field and its particles tend to evolve. Combining these gives the standard model Lagrangian,

13:36.680 --> 13:42.280
which allows us to track the evolution of all quantum fields through configuration space and

13:42.280 --> 13:48.760
so predict the behavior of all known particles. And remember, all of this started with Heron of

13:48.760 --> 13:55.160
Alexandria studying light 2000 years ago. He found a very simple and beautiful pattern in nature,

13:55.160 --> 14:01.000
and this has been inspiring us ever since. Through Fermat and Lagrangian Dirac and Feynman,

14:01.000 --> 14:07.720
each seeking a path through the configuration space of ideas, guided by mysterious principles,

14:07.800 --> 14:14.600
not least of which is the action, pointing the shortest way to the fundamental nature of space

14:14.600 --> 14:20.760
time. We'd like to thank NordVPN for supporting PBS. Imagine VPN as a secure encrypted tunnel

15:00.680 --> 15:06.120
enough how helpful your support is in keeping this show going. But today, I want to give a huge

15:06.120 --> 15:13.480
shout out to our quasi supporter, Michael Schneider. Hamilton's principle tells us that action must

15:13.480 --> 15:20.680
always be minimized or maximized. Michael, thank you for choosing maximal action. You clearly have

15:20.680 --> 15:26.920
a Lagrangian of the highest order, and we are delighted that our equations of motion have joined

15:26.920 --> 15:31.720
forces. Let's get into your comments on our recent episode on Constructor Theory. This was a

15:31.720 --> 15:36.440
contentious one. Many of you were dubious that Constructor Theory really offers anything new,

15:36.440 --> 15:39.960
and honestly I started out wondering the same, and it took me a lot of time

15:39.960 --> 15:45.400
to get an inkling that there probably is something in it. I'm still not as convinced as, for example,

15:45.400 --> 15:50.680
David Deutsch that this is some sort of huge revolution, but at least it seems a useful path

15:50.760 --> 15:56.760
to explore. Nestor de Buen asks, isn't this more of an epistemological framework than a

15:56.760 --> 16:02.840
theory, adding that everything would be better if physicists and philosophers of science collaborated

16:02.840 --> 16:09.160
more. So my sense is that Constructor Theory does try to bring a philosophical perspective shift,

16:09.160 --> 16:14.440
which in principle can be incredibly useful. All great discoveries came from perspective shifts.

16:15.080 --> 16:20.040
But there is math behind it also, which I understand is based on set theory and

16:20.040 --> 16:25.800
gothic theory, and for a great resource on those, I recommend the internet.

16:25.800 --> 16:31.640
Speaking of the math, Corbin Simpson and Skooks say that Constructor Theory sounds like category

16:31.640 --> 16:37.720
theory. I only learned about category theory while researching this episode when Chiara

16:37.720 --> 16:42.280
Maletto was asked at the end of one of her lectures whether she tried formulating Constructor

16:42.280 --> 16:47.160
Theory in terms of category theory, and she said she hadn't, but agreed that maybe they should.

16:47.720 --> 16:53.880
So nice insight there, Corbin and Skooks. As for what category theory is, it's loosely a way

16:53.880 --> 16:57.880
to generalise mathematics by representing mathematical concepts and the relationships

16:57.880 --> 17:03.160
between them with graphs. But for details, check my previous reference, the internet,

17:03.160 --> 17:08.760
chapter 7.4 I think. But as far as I understand, category theory, set theory, and presumably

17:08.760 --> 17:15.400
Constructor Theory are all attempts at formalising how we define and arrange our axiomatic foundations.

17:15.400 --> 17:20.680
This is all some pretty obtuse stuff, and some of you did a better job at explaining the point

17:20.680 --> 17:26.840
of Constructor Theory than I did, so let me just summarise. The Andy points out that Constructor

17:26.840 --> 17:31.640
Theory seeks to narrow down the space of all possible functions that might represent physical

17:31.640 --> 17:36.680
laws into the subset of functions that are consistent with the restrictions that come

17:36.680 --> 17:42.680
from observation. Subsequent observations and constraints then allow that set to be further

17:42.680 --> 17:47.880
narrowed. The hope is that this process converges on a single function, which means physics is over.

17:48.520 --> 17:54.280
Or we might find that there are still infinite functions that can perfectly describe the universe.

17:54.280 --> 17:59.480
Joe Habel also puts it well. If we assume the universe operates under certain assumptions,

18:00.040 --> 18:06.120
infinite finite discrete continuous space-time, invariance, quantum, etc., then Constructor

18:06.120 --> 18:11.960
Theory gives us insights as to what math is possible and what math should be restricting

18:11.960 --> 18:18.520
our models. Well that's nicely put Joe. So, rather than digging for the particular equation

18:18.520 --> 18:23.400
that describes the precise details of a given observed phenomenon, usually by trial and error,

18:24.040 --> 18:30.440
we come at it from the other direction and ask what sub-realm of math space we should be looking at

18:30.440 --> 18:36.840
given what we know with certainty is possible and impossible. DJ Club notes that Constructor

18:36.840 --> 18:43.160
Theory feels like alchemy. Relatedly, Cube C says, rough shade on Newton with the whole

18:43.160 --> 18:48.440
you can't transmute apples into gold line. And for those who are unaware, Isaac Newton was an

18:48.440 --> 18:54.120
avid alchemist. But I think there's a point to be made here. How could Newton have known which

18:54.120 --> 19:00.200
lines of inquiry would be fruitful without exploring them? Constructor Theory might be

19:00.200 --> 19:05.400
another alchemy or it might be another Newtonian mechanics. Shall we find out?

19:06.360 --> 19:12.440
Not according to Sinseverus, who says, it's honestly the dumbest thing in existence,

19:12.440 --> 19:17.960
best to forget it exists. Well, I am swayed by the strength of your conviction, Sinseverus,

19:17.960 --> 19:22.440
I guess we can rule out. What were we talking about again?
