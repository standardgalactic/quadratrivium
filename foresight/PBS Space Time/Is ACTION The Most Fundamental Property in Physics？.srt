Thank you to NordVPN for supporting PBS.

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,680
It's about time we discussed an obscure concept in physics that may be more fundamental

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,680
than energy and entropy, and perhaps time itself.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,840
Ready?

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,840
Action.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,640
In order to wrench the laws of physics from the reluctant clutches of nature,

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,600
we need to watch for clues, patterns in its behaviour that can reveal deeper truths.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,000
Here's an example.

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,280
Around 40 AD, Heron of Alexandria, noticed that when light moves between two points,

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,200
out of all possible paths between them, it follows the shortest one.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,400
He proposed what you might call a principle of least distance to define the path of light.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,000
Of course, we now know that light doesn't always travel in a straight line,

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,840
like when it's refracted by glass or travelling through a gravitational field.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,800
It took a millennium and a half following Heron for Pierre de Fermat to propose a solution

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,640
for the case of refraction.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,160
What if light didn't travel the path of least distance, but rather of least time?

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,440
If light changes speed between media, then the fastest trajectory is no longer a straight line.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,480
With this principle of least time, Fermat was able to explain all of the field of optics.

19
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,960
It seemed as if we'd stumbled upon a powerful guiding pattern in nature,

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,960
minimising principles.

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,320
What if there was a similar property that could be minimised to determine the trajectories

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,760
of matter as well as light?

23
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,240
There were some efforts, for example, Euler considered properties involving

24
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,880
momentum and kinetic energy, but to no avail.

25
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,560
In the meantime, Isaac Newton came up with his laws of motion, which gave us the

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,640
instant and miraculous power to explain the motion of all particles in the universe.

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,720
To do this, all you needed to do was know the exact vector forces on each body at

28
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,040
each time, which lets you calculate that body's exact vector position,

29
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,760
velocity and accelerations at each time.

30
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,560
That's doable for, say, a ball flying through the air, but it gets, frankly,

31
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,960
pretty hellish for complicated systems.

32
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,400
So maybe we were still in the market for a simple guiding principle after all.

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,840
It was Joseph Louis Lagrange who found that principle.

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,240
Consider again the ball flying through the air.

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,240
We can describe that motion without the painful vectors if we use energy.

36
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,080
The ball starts out moving fast, it has a lot of kinetic energy,

37
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,480
which it trades for potential energy as it rises and then back to kinetic as it falls.

38
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,920
If you need a refresher on the energy stuff, check out our previous video when you're done here.

39
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,720
You can figure out a lot just using energy like the maximum height the ball will reach,

40
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,120
but because energy doesn't include directional information, vectors,

41
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,040
it seems that you shouldn't be able to determine the exact path, except you can.

42
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,600
Lagrange realized that a particular combination of kinetic and potential energy

43
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,200
had the same minimizing property as does time for the path of light.

44
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,680
He found that the ball will always follow the path that minimizes

45
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,680
the timed average difference between these energies.

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,120
In other words, add up the difference between kinetic and potential energy

47
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,560
at all time steps during the flight and you get a number.

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,040
Then try the same for any other path that you can imagine.

49
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,640
The result will come out higher for every path other than the path that the ball actually travels.

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,640
Lagrange called this new quantity the action.

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,920
Formally, it's the integral over time of the kinetic minus potential energies,

52
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,640
and that difference in energies itself got the name Lagrangian,

53
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,480
which itself turns out to be an enormously important and useful quantity.

54
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,160
Lagrange proposed that everything in nature happens in such a way that action is always

55
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,080
minimized, and so was discovered the principle of least action.

56
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,600
A century later, William Hamilton made the important correction that action

57
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,240
is always minimized or maximized.

58
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,440
Here's an imaginary graph of how the action can change between paths.

59
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,200
You get paths where it's at its lowest and at its highest.

60
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,200
Moving objects tend to choose paths where the variation of the action between nearby paths

61
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,080
doesn't change much. In other words, where the slope of this curve is zero,

62
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,880
and that's true at both the minima and maxima.

63
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,560
Most of the time it's the minimum, which is why people still call this the principle of

64
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,640
least action, but others call it the stationary action principle.

65
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,960
If the principle of least action is true, then it should be possible to figure out the path

66
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,440
that any object will take between two points as long as you can find a way to determine

67
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:45,320
which has the minimum action. That sounds hard, but thankfully Lagrange and Euler already did

68
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,680
most of the work for us by finding the Euler-Lagrange equations, allowing both physics students

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,400
and nature to minimize their action.

70
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,120
The principle of least action, in combination with the Euler-Lagrange equations, leads to

71
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,880
Lagrangian mechanics. When you study Newton's mechanics and then move on to Lagrangian mechanics,

72
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,560
it seems almost like a miracle. The hellishly complex equations needed to solve problems using

73
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:17,000
pure Newton seem to just melt away into much simpler forms. This simplicity comes from the fact

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,760
that with Lagrangian mechanics we can dispense with forces and vectors in general and only

75
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,440
consider the energies. The principle of least action is so powerful that it really seems like

76
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,800
it must be telling us something deep about the universe. But what? It's hard to interpret

77
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,960
what this action property really signifies. Well, if it really is so fundamental, then it should

78
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,920
apply well beyond classical mechanics and into our modern theories, in particular general

79
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,840
relativity and quantum mechanics, and perhaps in these we'll find clues as to what the action

80
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,400
is really about. Let's start with Einstein's general theory of relativity, which as we've

81
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,360
discussed before, describes the force of gravity in terms of the bending of the fabric of space and

82
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,680
time. One of Einstein's motivations in developing general relativity was the fact that Newtonian

83
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,840
mechanics failed to correctly predict the orbit of Mercury. If you calculate that orbit using

84
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:19,240
the Einstein equations in their full glory and full gory detail, you get the right answer. But you

85
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,960
don't even need to go that far. If the principle of least action really is a fundamental law,

86
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,240
then there should be a relativistic version of the action that we can minimize to find Mercury's

87
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,440
orbit. After all, planets trade between potential and kinetic energy as they move around in their

88
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,160
orbits just like the ball. It turns out that we only need to make a couple of relativistic

89
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,320
corrections to do this. The most important is writing the Lagrangian as a function of something

90
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,640
called proper time. In relativity, clocks run at different rates depending on things like relative

91
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,280
speed and position in a gravitational field. Proper time is the time that an object will

92
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,520
perceive in its own reference frame. If you plug the relativistic Lagrangian into the Euler-Lagrange

93
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:09,240
equation, you get equations of motion correctly describing the orbit of Mercury around the sun.

94
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:16,600
This shows us that the principle of least action holds up in GR, but it reveals a lot more. First,

95
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,760
it means that Lagrangian mechanics based on this principle can be made to be Lorentz invariant.

96
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,960
It gives equations of motion that are valid even in the shifting frames of Einstein's relativity,

97
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,000
and we also start to learn something about the nature of the action. Once we apply the relativistic

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,480
corrections, the action simplifies into just an integral over proper time. Let's take a moment

99
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:47,080
to think about that, before action was a somewhat vague notion of change in energy. But working with

100
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,400
a more precise model of the universe, we see action is much easier to understand. Action

101
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,920
is now just how much time is perceived by an observer in their own frame of reference.

102
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:05,400
All objects moving through spacetime move through paths that minimize the time measured

103
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,120
on that path. Remember that Fermat figured out that light always travels the path that

104
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,400
minimizes its travel time, the principle of least time. Well, it turns out that this is just a special

105
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:21,720
case of a principle of least proper time. The reason for this is that in the classical limit,

106
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,480
proper time becomes kinetic minus potential energy for objects with mass. But for objects

107
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,240
without mass, like light, proper time and time are the same. Okay, it seems like we're getting

108
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,680
somewhere. Let's see if quantum mechanics will get us any deeper, or perhaps just make everything

109
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,720
more confusing. Let's start with the famous double slit experiment as we so often do when

110
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,840
talking quantum mechanics. In it, a stream of quantum particles are launched at a barrier with

111
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,640
two slits cut in it. When the stream reaches a detector screen on the other side, the individual

112
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,440
particles make individual spots, but over time the spots make out this series of bands and

113
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,000
interference pattern. The quantum interpretation of this is that the particle travels between

114
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,960
the source and the screen, not as a particle with a well-defined trajectory, but as a quantum

115
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,080
wave function that represents all possible paths that it could take. The wave function at the screen

116
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,280
represents the range of possible final locations for those paths, with some being more probable

117
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,120
than others. The particle that appears to randomly select a position from that distribution, but

118
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,840
there seems to be a conflict here. The principle of least action says that a particle will always

119
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,840
land where the action of the trajectory is at a minimum or maximum. That should correspond

120
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,360
only to the central points of those bands. However, we see particles landing at every

121
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,760
location in between, albeit with more likelihood the closer you get to these

122
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,640
action stationary points. So perhaps action isn't as fundamental as we thought it was,

123
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:57,160
or perhaps this is telling us something more about what the action really is. Paul Dirac very

124
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,800
nearly figured this out. He realized that a quantum analog of the action existed that was

125
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,720
related to the integrated time evolution of the wave function, and he realized that this quantity

126
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,440
should result in destructive interference in most places, like the dark bands in the

127
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,320
double slit experiment. It would lead to constructive interference only where this

128
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,400
quantum action varied slowly, near its stationary points, just like with classical action.

129
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,600
But the real action hero of this story is Richard Feynman.

130
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,200
Remember that the action tells us about a particle's history along some hypothetical path?

131
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,520
Feynman realized that the path of a quantum object could be determined by adding together

132
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:47,400
all possible paths that particles could take weighted by this quantum action. In this case,

133
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,160
the quantum action doesn't come from adding up kinetic minus potential energy,

134
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:58,040
nor the proper time. Instead, it effectively calculates the phase shift that a particle picks up

135
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,360
along each path towards its destination. Then it adds the phases of all conceivable paths to

136
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,720
that destination. We find that the most likely destinations are those where the phases line

137
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,320
up, constructively interfere. This is Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics,

138
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,360
and it exactly reproduces the predictions of previous versions of quantum mechanics,

139
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,160
for example Schrodinger's wave mechanics, that talks about the evolution of a single wave function.

140
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,760
This is analogous to how Lagrangian mechanics reproduced Newton's mechanics,

141
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:37,000
and it's no coincidence, because the path integral is the quantum analog of the principle

142
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
of least action. So what does this tell us about the action? Well, the path integral tells us that

143
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
a particular final destination is likely if the phases of the many paths that could lead to that

144
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,240
destination line up. Away from those special points, very tiny changes in the path lead to rapid

145
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,920
changes in the phase, causing those paths to cancel out. As Dirac started to guess, particles

146
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:07,080
tend to end up near the stationary points of the quantum action. In the path integral, this happens

147
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:13,800
for paths that take the shortest path, but not the shortest path through space, the shortest path

148
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,880
through something called configuration space. And this configuration space is what ties all of this

149
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:25,800
together. Configuration space is the space of all possible trajectories given our object's

150
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,240
constraints. In the case of the ball, configuration space refers to all the places the ball could

151
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,320
reach with its current potential and kinetic energies. When we take this to relativity, we see

152
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,320
that the configuration space becomes configuration spacetime, where the shortest path minimizes

153
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,160
proper time. In quantum mechanics, configuration space could mean phase space, which is the space

154
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:56,040
of all possible positions and momenta. Or it could be the more general state space, representing

155
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,560
all the quantum states that a system could evolve through. The application of the quantum

156
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,240
action principle to the evolution through quantum states underpins modern quantum theory.

157
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:14,200
Back to Paul Dirac, just for a moment. His eponymous equation was derived to describe

158
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:21,240
the quantum evolution of the electron. Well, it turns out that this equation is just the Lagrangian

159
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:28,760
for a spin half quantum field. And there's a Lagrangian for each quantum field, which describes

160
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:36,680
how that field and its particles tend to evolve. Combining these gives the standard model Lagrangian,

161
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,280
which allows us to track the evolution of all quantum fields through configuration space and

162
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:48,760
so predict the behavior of all known particles. And remember, all of this started with Heron of

163
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:55,160
Alexandria studying light 2000 years ago. He found a very simple and beautiful pattern in nature,

164
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:01,000
and this has been inspiring us ever since. Through Fermat and Lagrangian Dirac and Feynman,

165
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,720
each seeking a path through the configuration space of ideas, guided by mysterious principles,

166
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:14,600
not least of which is the action, pointing the shortest way to the fundamental nature of space

167
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,760
time. We'd like to thank NordVPN for supporting PBS. Imagine VPN as a secure encrypted tunnel

168
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,720
for online traffic to flow. Nobody can see through the tunnel and get their hands on your internet

169
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,160
data. NordVPN allows you to use public Wi-Fi and coffee shops or hotels or anywhere else that you're

170
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,200
on someone else's network. That way you can access personal and work accounts on the road,

171
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,960
or simply keep your browsing history to yourself. With NordVPN, your one account lets you connect

175
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,120
enough how helpful your support is in keeping this show going. But today, I want to give a huge

176
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:13,480
shout out to our quasi supporter, Michael Schneider. Hamilton's principle tells us that action must

177
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:20,680
always be minimized or maximized. Michael, thank you for choosing maximal action. You clearly have

178
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,920
a Lagrangian of the highest order, and we are delighted that our equations of motion have joined

179
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,720
forces. Let's get into your comments on our recent episode on Constructor Theory. This was a

180
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,440
contentious one. Many of you were dubious that Constructor Theory really offers anything new,

181
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,960
and honestly I started out wondering the same, and it took me a lot of time

182
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,400
to get an inkling that there probably is something in it. I'm still not as convinced as, for example,

183
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,680
David Deutsch that this is some sort of huge revolution, but at least it seems a useful path

184
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,760
to explore. Nestor de Buen asks, isn't this more of an epistemological framework than a

185
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,840
theory, adding that everything would be better if physicists and philosophers of science collaborated

186
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:09,160
more. So my sense is that Constructor Theory does try to bring a philosophical perspective shift,

187
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,440
which in principle can be incredibly useful. All great discoveries came from perspective shifts.

188
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:20,040
But there is math behind it also, which I understand is based on set theory and

189
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,800
gothic theory, and for a great resource on those, I recommend the internet.

190
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,640
Speaking of the math, Corbin Simpson and Skooks say that Constructor Theory sounds like category

191
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:37,720
theory. I only learned about category theory while researching this episode when Chiara

192
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,280
Maletto was asked at the end of one of her lectures whether she tried formulating Constructor

193
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,160
Theory in terms of category theory, and she said she hadn't, but agreed that maybe they should.

194
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,880
So nice insight there, Corbin and Skooks. As for what category theory is, it's loosely a way

195
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,880
to generalise mathematics by representing mathematical concepts and the relationships

196
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:03,160
between them with graphs. But for details, check my previous reference, the internet,

197
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,760
chapter 7.4 I think. But as far as I understand, category theory, set theory, and presumably

198
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:15,400
Constructor Theory are all attempts at formalising how we define and arrange our axiomatic foundations.

199
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,680
This is all some pretty obtuse stuff, and some of you did a better job at explaining the point

200
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:26,840
of Constructor Theory than I did, so let me just summarise. The Andy points out that Constructor

201
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,640
Theory seeks to narrow down the space of all possible functions that might represent physical

202
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,680
laws into the subset of functions that are consistent with the restrictions that come

203
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:42,680
from observation. Subsequent observations and constraints then allow that set to be further

204
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,880
narrowed. The hope is that this process converges on a single function, which means physics is over.

205
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:54,280
Or we might find that there are still infinite functions that can perfectly describe the universe.

206
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,480
Joe Habel also puts it well. If we assume the universe operates under certain assumptions,

207
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:06,120
infinite finite discrete continuous space-time, invariance, quantum, etc., then Constructor

208
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,960
Theory gives us insights as to what math is possible and what math should be restricting

209
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:18,520
our models. Well that's nicely put Joe. So, rather than digging for the particular equation

210
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,400
that describes the precise details of a given observed phenomenon, usually by trial and error,

211
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:30,440
we come at it from the other direction and ask what sub-realm of math space we should be looking at

212
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,840
given what we know with certainty is possible and impossible. DJ Club notes that Constructor

213
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:43,160
Theory feels like alchemy. Relatedly, Cube C says, rough shade on Newton with the whole

214
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,440
you can't transmute apples into gold line. And for those who are unaware, Isaac Newton was an

215
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:54,120
avid alchemist. But I think there's a point to be made here. How could Newton have known which

216
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:00,200
lines of inquiry would be fruitful without exploring them? Constructor Theory might be

217
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,400
another alchemy or it might be another Newtonian mechanics. Shall we find out?

218
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,440
Not according to Sinseverus, who says, it's honestly the dumbest thing in existence,

219
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:17,960
best to forget it exists. Well, I am swayed by the strength of your conviction, Sinseverus,

220
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,440
I guess we can rule out. What were we talking about again?
