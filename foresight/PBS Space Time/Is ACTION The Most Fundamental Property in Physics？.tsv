3120	7680	It's about time we discussed an obscure concept in physics that may be more fundamental
7680	11680	than energy and entropy, and perhaps time itself.
11680	12840	Ready?
12840	13840	Action.
18560	22640	In order to wrench the laws of physics from the reluctant clutches of nature,
22640	27600	we need to watch for clues, patterns in its behaviour that can reveal deeper truths.
27600	29000	Here's an example.
29080	34280	Around 40 AD, Heron of Alexandria, noticed that when light moves between two points,
34280	38200	out of all possible paths between them, it follows the shortest one.
38200	43400	He proposed what you might call a principle of least distance to define the path of light.
44200	47000	Of course, we now know that light doesn't always travel in a straight line,
47000	50840	like when it's refracted by glass or travelling through a gravitational field.
50840	55800	It took a millennium and a half following Heron for Pierre de Fermat to propose a solution
55800	57640	for the case of refraction.
57640	63160	What if light didn't travel the path of least distance, but rather of least time?
63160	68440	If light changes speed between media, then the fastest trajectory is no longer a straight line.
69000	75480	With this principle of least time, Fermat was able to explain all of the field of optics.
75480	79960	It seemed as if we'd stumbled upon a powerful guiding pattern in nature,
80600	81960	minimising principles.
82680	87320	What if there was a similar property that could be minimised to determine the trajectories
87320	88760	of matter as well as light?
89560	93240	There were some efforts, for example, Euler considered properties involving
93240	95880	momentum and kinetic energy, but to no avail.
96680	101560	In the meantime, Isaac Newton came up with his laws of motion, which gave us the
101560	105640	instant and miraculous power to explain the motion of all particles in the universe.
106200	111720	To do this, all you needed to do was know the exact vector forces on each body at
111720	116040	each time, which lets you calculate that body's exact vector position,
116040	118760	velocity and accelerations at each time.
119560	123560	That's doable for, say, a ball flying through the air, but it gets, frankly,
123560	125960	pretty hellish for complicated systems.
126600	131400	So maybe we were still in the market for a simple guiding principle after all.
131400	134840	It was Joseph Louis Lagrange who found that principle.
134840	137240	Consider again the ball flying through the air.
137240	141240	We can describe that motion without the painful vectors if we use energy.
141720	145080	The ball starts out moving fast, it has a lot of kinetic energy,
145080	149480	which it trades for potential energy as it rises and then back to kinetic as it falls.
150280	154920	If you need a refresher on the energy stuff, check out our previous video when you're done here.
155800	159720	You can figure out a lot just using energy like the maximum height the ball will reach,
159720	164120	but because energy doesn't include directional information, vectors,
164120	170040	it seems that you shouldn't be able to determine the exact path, except you can.
170040	174600	Lagrange realized that a particular combination of kinetic and potential energy
174600	178200	had the same minimizing property as does time for the path of light.
178840	182680	He found that the ball will always follow the path that minimizes
182680	186680	the timed average difference between these energies.
186680	190120	In other words, add up the difference between kinetic and potential energy
190120	193560	at all time steps during the flight and you get a number.
194440	198040	Then try the same for any other path that you can imagine.
198040	203640	The result will come out higher for every path other than the path that the ball actually travels.
204520	207640	Lagrange called this new quantity the action.
208520	212920	Formally, it's the integral over time of the kinetic minus potential energies,
213560	217640	and that difference in energies itself got the name Lagrangian,
217640	221480	which itself turns out to be an enormously important and useful quantity.
221480	227160	Lagrange proposed that everything in nature happens in such a way that action is always
227160	231080	minimized, and so was discovered the principle of least action.
231800	236600	A century later, William Hamilton made the important correction that action
236600	239240	is always minimized or maximized.
239800	244440	Here's an imaginary graph of how the action can change between paths.
244440	248200	You get paths where it's at its lowest and at its highest.
248760	254200	Moving objects tend to choose paths where the variation of the action between nearby paths
254280	259080	doesn't change much. In other words, where the slope of this curve is zero,
259080	261880	and that's true at both the minima and maxima.
261880	265560	Most of the time it's the minimum, which is why people still call this the principle of
265560	269640	least action, but others call it the stationary action principle.
269640	273960	If the principle of least action is true, then it should be possible to figure out the path
273960	278440	that any object will take between two points as long as you can find a way to determine
278440	285320	which has the minimum action. That sounds hard, but thankfully Lagrange and Euler already did
285320	290680	most of the work for us by finding the Euler-Lagrange equations, allowing both physics students
290680	293400	and nature to minimize their action.
293400	298120	The principle of least action, in combination with the Euler-Lagrange equations, leads to
298120	303880	Lagrangian mechanics. When you study Newton's mechanics and then move on to Lagrangian mechanics,
303880	309560	it seems almost like a miracle. The hellishly complex equations needed to solve problems using
309560	317000	pure Newton seem to just melt away into much simpler forms. This simplicity comes from the fact
317000	322760	that with Lagrangian mechanics we can dispense with forces and vectors in general and only
322760	328440	consider the energies. The principle of least action is so powerful that it really seems like
328440	333800	it must be telling us something deep about the universe. But what? It's hard to interpret
333960	339960	what this action property really signifies. Well, if it really is so fundamental, then it should
339960	344920	apply well beyond classical mechanics and into our modern theories, in particular general
344920	350840	relativity and quantum mechanics, and perhaps in these we'll find clues as to what the action
350840	355400	is really about. Let's start with Einstein's general theory of relativity, which as we've
355400	360360	discussed before, describes the force of gravity in terms of the bending of the fabric of space and
360360	366680	time. One of Einstein's motivations in developing general relativity was the fact that Newtonian
366680	372840	mechanics failed to correctly predict the orbit of Mercury. If you calculate that orbit using
372840	379240	the Einstein equations in their full glory and full gory detail, you get the right answer. But you
379240	383960	don't even need to go that far. If the principle of least action really is a fundamental law,
383960	389240	then there should be a relativistic version of the action that we can minimize to find Mercury's
389240	394440	orbit. After all, planets trade between potential and kinetic energy as they move around in their
394440	399160	orbits just like the ball. It turns out that we only need to make a couple of relativistic
399160	405320	corrections to do this. The most important is writing the Lagrangian as a function of something
405320	411640	called proper time. In relativity, clocks run at different rates depending on things like relative
411640	416280	speed and position in a gravitational field. Proper time is the time that an object will
416280	422520	perceive in its own reference frame. If you plug the relativistic Lagrangian into the Euler-Lagrange
422520	429240	equation, you get equations of motion correctly describing the orbit of Mercury around the sun.
429240	436600	This shows us that the principle of least action holds up in GR, but it reveals a lot more. First,
436600	442760	it means that Lagrangian mechanics based on this principle can be made to be Lorentz invariant.
442760	447960	It gives equations of motion that are valid even in the shifting frames of Einstein's relativity,
447960	453000	and we also start to learn something about the nature of the action. Once we apply the relativistic
453000	459480	corrections, the action simplifies into just an integral over proper time. Let's take a moment
459480	467080	to think about that, before action was a somewhat vague notion of change in energy. But working with
467080	473400	a more precise model of the universe, we see action is much easier to understand. Action
473400	478920	is now just how much time is perceived by an observer in their own frame of reference.
479560	485400	All objects moving through spacetime move through paths that minimize the time measured
485400	490120	on that path. Remember that Fermat figured out that light always travels the path that
490120	495400	minimizes its travel time, the principle of least time. Well, it turns out that this is just a special
495480	501720	case of a principle of least proper time. The reason for this is that in the classical limit,
501720	507480	proper time becomes kinetic minus potential energy for objects with mass. But for objects
507480	513240	without mass, like light, proper time and time are the same. Okay, it seems like we're getting
513240	518680	somewhere. Let's see if quantum mechanics will get us any deeper, or perhaps just make everything
518680	523720	more confusing. Let's start with the famous double slit experiment as we so often do when
523720	528840	talking quantum mechanics. In it, a stream of quantum particles are launched at a barrier with
528840	533640	two slits cut in it. When the stream reaches a detector screen on the other side, the individual
533640	538440	particles make individual spots, but over time the spots make out this series of bands and
538440	543000	interference pattern. The quantum interpretation of this is that the particle travels between
543000	547960	the source and the screen, not as a particle with a well-defined trajectory, but as a quantum
547960	553080	wave function that represents all possible paths that it could take. The wave function at the screen
553080	558280	represents the range of possible final locations for those paths, with some being more probable
558280	564120	than others. The particle that appears to randomly select a position from that distribution, but
564120	568840	there seems to be a conflict here. The principle of least action says that a particle will always
568840	574840	land where the action of the trajectory is at a minimum or maximum. That should correspond
574840	580360	only to the central points of those bands. However, we see particles landing at every
580360	584760	location in between, albeit with more likelihood the closer you get to these
584760	589640	action stationary points. So perhaps action isn't as fundamental as we thought it was,
590520	597160	or perhaps this is telling us something more about what the action really is. Paul Dirac very
597160	603800	nearly figured this out. He realized that a quantum analog of the action existed that was
603800	609720	related to the integrated time evolution of the wave function, and he realized that this quantity
609720	614440	should result in destructive interference in most places, like the dark bands in the
614440	619320	double slit experiment. It would lead to constructive interference only where this
619320	625400	quantum action varied slowly, near its stationary points, just like with classical action.
626280	630600	But the real action hero of this story is Richard Feynman.
631320	636200	Remember that the action tells us about a particle's history along some hypothetical path?
636280	640520	Feynman realized that the path of a quantum object could be determined by adding together
640520	647400	all possible paths that particles could take weighted by this quantum action. In this case,
647400	651160	the quantum action doesn't come from adding up kinetic minus potential energy,
651160	658040	nor the proper time. Instead, it effectively calculates the phase shift that a particle picks up
658040	664360	along each path towards its destination. Then it adds the phases of all conceivable paths to
664360	669720	that destination. We find that the most likely destinations are those where the phases line
669720	675320	up, constructively interfere. This is Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics,
675320	680360	and it exactly reproduces the predictions of previous versions of quantum mechanics,
680360	685160	for example Schrodinger's wave mechanics, that talks about the evolution of a single wave function.
685880	690760	This is analogous to how Lagrangian mechanics reproduced Newton's mechanics,
690760	697000	and it's no coincidence, because the path integral is the quantum analog of the principle
697000	703000	of least action. So what does this tell us about the action? Well, the path integral tells us that
703000	709000	a particular final destination is likely if the phases of the many paths that could lead to that
709000	715240	destination line up. Away from those special points, very tiny changes in the path lead to rapid
715240	720920	changes in the phase, causing those paths to cancel out. As Dirac started to guess, particles
720920	727080	tend to end up near the stationary points of the quantum action. In the path integral, this happens
727080	733800	for paths that take the shortest path, but not the shortest path through space, the shortest path
733800	739880	through something called configuration space. And this configuration space is what ties all of this
739960	745800	together. Configuration space is the space of all possible trajectories given our object's
745800	751240	constraints. In the case of the ball, configuration space refers to all the places the ball could
751240	757320	reach with its current potential and kinetic energies. When we take this to relativity, we see
757320	763320	that the configuration space becomes configuration spacetime, where the shortest path minimizes
763320	769160	proper time. In quantum mechanics, configuration space could mean phase space, which is the space
769160	776040	of all possible positions and momenta. Or it could be the more general state space, representing
776040	781560	all the quantum states that a system could evolve through. The application of the quantum
781560	787240	action principle to the evolution through quantum states underpins modern quantum theory.
788040	794200	Back to Paul Dirac, just for a moment. His eponymous equation was derived to describe
794200	801240	the quantum evolution of the electron. Well, it turns out that this equation is just the Lagrangian
801240	808760	for a spin half quantum field. And there's a Lagrangian for each quantum field, which describes
808760	816680	how that field and its particles tend to evolve. Combining these gives the standard model Lagrangian,
816680	822280	which allows us to track the evolution of all quantum fields through configuration space and
822280	828760	so predict the behavior of all known particles. And remember, all of this started with Heron of
828760	835160	Alexandria studying light 2000 years ago. He found a very simple and beautiful pattern in nature,
835160	841000	and this has been inspiring us ever since. Through Fermat and Lagrangian Dirac and Feynman,
841000	847720	each seeking a path through the configuration space of ideas, guided by mysterious principles,
847800	854600	not least of which is the action, pointing the shortest way to the fundamental nature of space
854600	860760	time. We'd like to thank NordVPN for supporting PBS. Imagine VPN as a secure encrypted tunnel

900680	906120	enough how helpful your support is in keeping this show going. But today, I want to give a huge
906120	913480	shout out to our quasi supporter, Michael Schneider. Hamilton's principle tells us that action must
913480	920680	always be minimized or maximized. Michael, thank you for choosing maximal action. You clearly have
920680	926920	a Lagrangian of the highest order, and we are delighted that our equations of motion have joined
926920	931720	forces. Let's get into your comments on our recent episode on Constructor Theory. This was a
931720	936440	contentious one. Many of you were dubious that Constructor Theory really offers anything new,
936440	939960	and honestly I started out wondering the same, and it took me a lot of time
939960	945400	to get an inkling that there probably is something in it. I'm still not as convinced as, for example,
945400	950680	David Deutsch that this is some sort of huge revolution, but at least it seems a useful path
950760	956760	to explore. Nestor de Buen asks, isn't this more of an epistemological framework than a
956760	962840	theory, adding that everything would be better if physicists and philosophers of science collaborated
962840	969160	more. So my sense is that Constructor Theory does try to bring a philosophical perspective shift,
969160	974440	which in principle can be incredibly useful. All great discoveries came from perspective shifts.
975080	980040	But there is math behind it also, which I understand is based on set theory and
980040	985800	gothic theory, and for a great resource on those, I recommend the internet.
985800	991640	Speaking of the math, Corbin Simpson and Skooks say that Constructor Theory sounds like category
991640	997720	theory. I only learned about category theory while researching this episode when Chiara
997720	1002280	Maletto was asked at the end of one of her lectures whether she tried formulating Constructor
1002280	1007160	Theory in terms of category theory, and she said she hadn't, but agreed that maybe they should.
1007720	1013880	So nice insight there, Corbin and Skooks. As for what category theory is, it's loosely a way
1013880	1017880	to generalise mathematics by representing mathematical concepts and the relationships
1017880	1023160	between them with graphs. But for details, check my previous reference, the internet,
1023160	1028760	chapter 7.4 I think. But as far as I understand, category theory, set theory, and presumably
1028760	1035400	Constructor Theory are all attempts at formalising how we define and arrange our axiomatic foundations.
1035400	1040680	This is all some pretty obtuse stuff, and some of you did a better job at explaining the point
1040680	1046840	of Constructor Theory than I did, so let me just summarise. The Andy points out that Constructor
1046840	1051640	Theory seeks to narrow down the space of all possible functions that might represent physical
1051640	1056680	laws into the subset of functions that are consistent with the restrictions that come
1056680	1062680	from observation. Subsequent observations and constraints then allow that set to be further
1062680	1067880	narrowed. The hope is that this process converges on a single function, which means physics is over.
1068520	1074280	Or we might find that there are still infinite functions that can perfectly describe the universe.
1074280	1079480	Joe Habel also puts it well. If we assume the universe operates under certain assumptions,
1080040	1086120	infinite finite discrete continuous space-time, invariance, quantum, etc., then Constructor
1086120	1091960	Theory gives us insights as to what math is possible and what math should be restricting
1091960	1098520	our models. Well that's nicely put Joe. So, rather than digging for the particular equation
1098520	1103400	that describes the precise details of a given observed phenomenon, usually by trial and error,
1104040	1110440	we come at it from the other direction and ask what sub-realm of math space we should be looking at
1110440	1116840	given what we know with certainty is possible and impossible. DJ Club notes that Constructor
1116840	1123160	Theory feels like alchemy. Relatedly, Cube C says, rough shade on Newton with the whole
1123160	1128440	you can't transmute apples into gold line. And for those who are unaware, Isaac Newton was an
1128440	1134120	avid alchemist. But I think there's a point to be made here. How could Newton have known which
1134120	1140200	lines of inquiry would be fruitful without exploring them? Constructor Theory might be
1140200	1145400	another alchemy or it might be another Newtonian mechanics. Shall we find out?
1146360	1152440	Not according to Sinseverus, who says, it's honestly the dumbest thing in existence,
1152440	1157960	best to forget it exists. Well, I am swayed by the strength of your conviction, Sinseverus,
1157960	1162440	I guess we can rule out. What were we talking about again?
