3440	7600	In around four and a half billion years, the Andromeda Galaxy and their own Milky Way
7600	14240	will finish their long mutual plummet. On a first grazing pass, the delicate spiral arms will be
14240	20160	yanked almost out of their sockets. Perhaps their denizens will look back with relief
20160	26400	as the dislocated galaxies retreat on their future night skies. But then they'll pause
26400	31760	for a hundred thousand year eye blink before falling back together. In a series of whirling
31760	36720	collisions, all spiral structure will be obliterated, gas will be compacted to produce
36720	42560	waves of supernovae, and the giant milk-dromeda galaxy will have been born.
42560	47440	The event I just described will happen as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow.
47440	52080	We know this because we've calculated the chaotic gravitational and hydrodynamic
52080	58880	interactions of countless stars and gas and dark matter particles over billions of future years.
59840	65920	And simulations of galaxy collisions are just the beginning. We routinely simulate the universe
65920	72320	on all of its scales, from planets to large fractions of the cosmos. Today we're going to
72320	79440	see how it's possible to build a universe in a computer, and to see whether there's a limit
79440	81200	to what we can simulate.
86640	91840	In 1941, the Swedish astronomer Erik Holmberg conducted what was probably the first
91840	97760	simulation of the universe. Right when the first programmable computers were being assembled,
98400	105840	but Holmberg didn't use a computer, he arrayed 37 light bulbs on a plane, each one representing
105840	111760	billions of stars in a spiral galaxy disk. The light from each bulb was its gravity,
111760	116080	felt more strongly close to the bulb, and dropping away with a square of distance,
116080	122640	just like gravity. At any point on the disk, a galvanic cell could determine in which direction
122640	128000	the intensity of light was strongest. So the simulation went like this. Holmberg started with
128000	133360	a pair of these light bulb galaxies next to each other, with the motion of each bulb existing
133360	138560	only as a note on a piece of paper. He would then measure the light at each bulb,
138560	144640	which told him the sum gravitational pull on that group of stars. He'd then adjust the
144640	151040	velocities of all according to Newton's laws. Finally, he'd allow time to tick forward. He'd
151040	155680	move the bulbs according to their new velocities. Then from that new configuration he'd start
155680	162320	the process again. And so the two galaxies collided. Just as with our modern supercomputer
162320	168160	simulations, he witnessed the destruction of the disks, the throwing off of tidal streams,
168160	175280	and the formation of an elliptical galaxy. Holmberg's experiment was ingenious. But why go to all this
175280	181040	effort? Since the time of Isaac Newton, it had been possible to write down equations describing
181040	186240	the trajectories of a pair of massive bodies moving in each other's gravitational fields.
187040	192240	And then to solve those equations to find their positions at any time in the future.
192240	198560	But note that I said pairs of bodies. This only works for two objects. For three or more bodies,
198560	203600	there is no simple set of equations describing their future evolution under gravity.
204400	208080	This is the so-called three-body problem, which we've discussed in the past.
208880	214240	The three-body problem doesn't have any analytical solution, no simple master equations,
214240	217840	which is why Holmberg had to solve the problem with light bulbs.
218720	223680	Holmberg did what we call a numerical calculation, in which an impossibly complex
223680	228960	computation is broken down into a series of much simpler steps. And this particular type
228960	235760	of numerical calculation is called an n-body simulation. In an n-body simulation, Newton's
235760	241120	laws of motion and gravity are applied over a series of time steps. Each step is short enough
241200	247440	that we can assume that the global gravitational field is constant. It only changes in the next step,
247440	252720	after all the particles have made their moves. The predictions of these n-body simulations
252720	259120	can be as accurate as you like, as long as you make the time steps small enough. And I would hope so,
259120	263760	because this is essentially how we calculate the trajectories that place people on the moon or
263760	270320	land robots on comets. For simulating a solar system, this method is pretty reasonable. In fact,
270320	276080	the room-sized computer used to calculate the Apollo trajectories had about the computing power
276080	281600	of your smartphone. But if we want realistic simulations of, say, a galaxy with its billions
281600	288240	of stars, we need to do a bit better. Fortunately, computing power has improved somewhat since
288240	294080	Holmberg or the Apollo missions. But actually, it's improved nowhere near enough to do n-body
294080	299520	simulations of entire galaxies using the method that I described. Let's think about what this
299520	306240	computation really needs. In the simplest type of n-body simulation, you need to compute the effect
306240	313120	of every particle on every other particle. So if there are n-particles, that's n-squared
313120	318480	calculations. For a modern one million particle simulation of, say, a star cluster, that's a
318480	323600	trillion computations per time step. The real challenge in astrophysics is that we often have
323600	329440	to deal with huge ranges in scale. For example, in a cosmological simulation, we're trying to
329440	335360	watch the detailed formation of individual galaxies, as well as the evolution of giant clusters of
335360	341600	galaxies. But if we keep enough precision to get the fine structure, it's computationally impossible
341600	347600	to also produce a large enough volume to get the larger scales. To do these simulations,
347600	352720	astrophysicists have to come up with some ingenious tricks. Perhaps the most important
352720	358320	is to avoid having to consider every single particle pair. Remember, the strength of gravity
358320	363440	drops off with distance squared. For nearby particles, it's important to consider every
363440	368880	individual interaction. But for more distant locations, it's okay to clump particles together
368880	374080	and consider only their sum gravitational effect. One of the original approaches to doing this is
374080	379440	a so-called tree code. It works like this. You start with a volume full of particles,
379440	385120	each with its starting position and velocity. Now, divide up the volume into eight sub-cubes,
385120	391040	then divide each of these into eight more, and so on. You stop dividing at any given part of the
391040	398320	volume when there is no more than one particle per cube in that part. Next, you run an n-body
398320	403760	simulation by calculating the sum gravitational pull on each given particle. But now you have
403760	408640	a shortcut. When you calculate the effect from distant locations, you don't do it for each
408640	414000	particle. Instead, you do it for all particles inside one of these cubes. The larger the distance,
414000	418560	the larger the cube you can use. Now, this sounds like a complicated process, but now the number
418560	425520	of calculations that you need to do goes down from n squared to n times log n, which for large
425520	432000	particle numbers is much, much faster. Another approach is the particle mesh method, in which
432000	437600	particles are converted into a density distribution and a gravitational potential across the grid.
437600	442640	The force at each point can then be solved using Fourier transform methods, which can
442640	449840	be very fast. Adaptive particle meshes can be used to add higher resolution when needed,
449840	456320	say where the stars have higher density or structure. Modern mesh codes also do classic
456320	462000	particle-particle interactions at short ranges to improve accuracy at small scales. These mesh
462000	467120	codes are useful for systems of particles interacting under gravity, but they also work
467120	473440	for another really important astrophysical situation, flowing gas. The universe started
473440	479200	as an ocean of gas a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang. That gas is still everywhere.
479200	485200	It flows into galaxies from beyond where it rides the disk, fragments and collapses into stars.
485200	490480	It forms whirlpools and jets around new stars and black holes. All of these processes are key
490480	496560	parts of galaxy evolution and of star and planet formation, and so we'd better be able to simulate
496560	503360	this too. Now we call these hydrodynamic simulations. They simulate the flow of gas
503360	509120	using the equations of fluid dynamics. Particle mesh approaches can do this,
509120	513600	but these days it's more common to use an approach called smoothed particle hydrodynamics,
513600	521280	or SPH. SPH codes don't use a rigid grid, but rather they track tracer particles within the
521280	527120	fluid. Those particles effectively make up a constantly shifting grid. In astrophysics, SPH
527120	533360	codes are used to simulate the flows of gas in galaxies and around quasars, used to simulate star
533360	539680	and planet formation, and even star and planet destruction in collisions or supernovae. SPH
539680	545520	can even be used to do galaxy formation where the stars themselves are treated as a type of fluid.
545520	551920	In practice, modern simulations often use an amalgam of these methods. For example, SPH for
551920	558320	large-scale flows and particle-particle n-body for small-scale interactions. Astrophysicists
558320	563840	often inject all sorts of other physics into their simulations. In your galaxy simulation,
563840	570560	you might need a separate prescription to describe how stars age and die. In your quasar disk,
570640	576080	you need to simulate separately how light travels through the hot plasma, and don't get me started
576080	581360	about the complexity of including magnetic fields or of Einstein's general relativity when the
581360	586800	gravitational field becomes very strong. With the techniques now available, using parallelised
586800	594160	code on modern computing clusters, we can compute some pretty insane simulations. We can see how
594160	600080	stars form in multitudes from collapsing gas clouds, and how planets then coalesce in the
600080	606800	disks surrounding those stars. We can watch as galaxies form with gas and dark matter interacting
606800	612960	to produce waves of star formation and supernovae, settling into spiral structures just like we see
612960	619680	in the real universe. And then we have cosmological simulations, which create entire virtual universes,
620240	625040	from the moment the first atoms formed to the modern day. One of the most famous is the
625040	630640	Millennium Simulation from the Max Planck Institute in Germany. It simulated a 13 billion
630640	637280	light-year-wide cube containing over 300 billion particles, each representing a billion sun's
637280	643680	worth of dark matter. But the current largest cosmological simulation is Abacus Summit,
643680	649600	which just last year simulated 70 trillion particles on the supercomputers at the Center
649600	657440	for Computational Astrophysics in New York. So how far can all of this go? Can we ever simulate
657440	662480	a real universe in which creatures evolve that can themselves simulate universes?
663440	670320	In fact, could we be such creatures? Probably not. None of these simulations contain the full
670320	674560	information of an actual universe or even a tiny part of it. As we discussed recently,
674560	679200	a full quantum description of the world contains unthinkably more information than is contained
679200	686000	in a typical simulation, which just tracks particle positions and velocities. No conceivable technology
686000	692080	could fully simulate a quantum universe, except perhaps a cosmologically sized quantum computer,
692640	698240	which is kind of what the universe is anyway. We've talked about this simulation and hypothesis
698320	703520	stuff before, and maybe we'll come back to it. For now, let's just be proud of the science
703520	708880	that we can get from modern simulations, because we've come an awful long way since Eric Holmberg
708880	714640	pushed some light bulbs around on his table. And the fidelity and size of our simulations will
714640	720240	only get better as computing power continues its exponential growth and as we invent better and
720240	726480	better algorithms. Perhaps there is no limit to what we can learn about the outside universe by
726480	733040	rebuilding it inside our computers and then peering into that simulated space time.
