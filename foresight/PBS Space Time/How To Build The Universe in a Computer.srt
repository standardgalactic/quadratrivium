00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Thank you to Ren for supporting PBS.

00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,600
In around four and a half billion years, the Andromeda Galaxy and their own Milky Way

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,240
will finish their long mutual plummet. On a first grazing pass, the delicate spiral arms will be

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,160
yanked almost out of their sockets. Perhaps their denizens will look back with relief

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,400
as the dislocated galaxies retreat on their future night skies. But then they'll pause

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,760
for a hundred thousand year eye blink before falling back together. In a series of whirling

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,720
collisions, all spiral structure will be obliterated, gas will be compacted to produce

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,560
waves of supernovae, and the giant milk-dromeda galaxy will have been born.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,440
The event I just described will happen as surely as the sun will rise tomorrow.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,080
We know this because we've calculated the chaotic gravitational and hydrodynamic

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,880
interactions of countless stars and gas and dark matter particles over billions of future years.

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,920
And simulations of galaxy collisions are just the beginning. We routinely simulate the universe

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,320
on all of its scales, from planets to large fractions of the cosmos. Today we're going to

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,440
see how it's possible to build a universe in a computer, and to see whether there's a limit

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,200
to what we can simulate.

16
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,840
In 1941, the Swedish astronomer Erik Holmberg conducted what was probably the first

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,760
simulation of the universe. Right when the first programmable computers were being assembled,

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,840
but Holmberg didn't use a computer, he arrayed 37 light bulbs on a plane, each one representing

19
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,760
billions of stars in a spiral galaxy disk. The light from each bulb was its gravity,

20
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,080
felt more strongly close to the bulb, and dropping away with a square of distance,

21
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,640
just like gravity. At any point on the disk, a galvanic cell could determine in which direction

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,000
the intensity of light was strongest. So the simulation went like this. Holmberg started with

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,360
a pair of these light bulb galaxies next to each other, with the motion of each bulb existing

24
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,560
only as a note on a piece of paper. He would then measure the light at each bulb,

25
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,640
which told him the sum gravitational pull on that group of stars. He'd then adjust the

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,040
velocities of all according to Newton's laws. Finally, he'd allow time to tick forward. He'd

27
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,680
move the bulbs according to their new velocities. Then from that new configuration he'd start

28
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,320
the process again. And so the two galaxies collided. Just as with our modern supercomputer

29
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:48,160
simulations, he witnessed the destruction of the disks, the throwing off of tidal streams,

30
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:55,280
and the formation of an elliptical galaxy. Holmberg's experiment was ingenious. But why go to all this

31
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,040
effort? Since the time of Isaac Newton, it had been possible to write down equations describing

32
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,240
the trajectories of a pair of massive bodies moving in each other's gravitational fields.

33
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,240
And then to solve those equations to find their positions at any time in the future.

34
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,560
But note that I said pairs of bodies. This only works for two objects. For three or more bodies,

35
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,600
there is no simple set of equations describing their future evolution under gravity.

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,080
This is the so-called three-body problem, which we've discussed in the past.

37
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,240
The three-body problem doesn't have any analytical solution, no simple master equations,

38
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,840
which is why Holmberg had to solve the problem with light bulbs.

39
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,680
Holmberg did what we call a numerical calculation, in which an impossibly complex

40
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,960
computation is broken down into a series of much simpler steps. And this particular type

41
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:55,760
of numerical calculation is called an n-body simulation. In an n-body simulation, Newton's

42
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,120
laws of motion and gravity are applied over a series of time steps. Each step is short enough

43
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,440
that we can assume that the global gravitational field is constant. It only changes in the next step,

44
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,720
after all the particles have made their moves. The predictions of these n-body simulations

45
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,120
can be as accurate as you like, as long as you make the time steps small enough. And I would hope so,

46
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,760
because this is essentially how we calculate the trajectories that place people on the moon or

47
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,320
land robots on comets. For simulating a solar system, this method is pretty reasonable. In fact,

48
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,080
the room-sized computer used to calculate the Apollo trajectories had about the computing power

49
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,600
of your smartphone. But if we want realistic simulations of, say, a galaxy with its billions

50
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,240
of stars, we need to do a bit better. Fortunately, computing power has improved somewhat since

51
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,080
Holmberg or the Apollo missions. But actually, it's improved nowhere near enough to do n-body

52
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,520
simulations of entire galaxies using the method that I described. Let's think about what this

53
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:06,240
computation really needs. In the simplest type of n-body simulation, you need to compute the effect

54
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,120
of every particle on every other particle. So if there are n-particles, that's n-squared

55
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,480
calculations. For a modern one million particle simulation of, say, a star cluster, that's a

56
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,600
trillion computations per time step. The real challenge in astrophysics is that we often have

57
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,440
to deal with huge ranges in scale. For example, in a cosmological simulation, we're trying to

58
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,360
watch the detailed formation of individual galaxies, as well as the evolution of giant clusters of

59
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,600
galaxies. But if we keep enough precision to get the fine structure, it's computationally impossible

60
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,600
to also produce a large enough volume to get the larger scales. To do these simulations,

61
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,720
astrophysicists have to come up with some ingenious tricks. Perhaps the most important

62
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,320
is to avoid having to consider every single particle pair. Remember, the strength of gravity

63
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,440
drops off with distance squared. For nearby particles, it's important to consider every

64
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,880
individual interaction. But for more distant locations, it's okay to clump particles together

65
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,080
and consider only their sum gravitational effect. One of the original approaches to doing this is

66
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,440
a so-called tree code. It works like this. You start with a volume full of particles,

67
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,120
each with its starting position and velocity. Now, divide up the volume into eight sub-cubes,

68
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,040
then divide each of these into eight more, and so on. You stop dividing at any given part of the

69
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:38,320
volume when there is no more than one particle per cube in that part. Next, you run an n-body

70
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,760
simulation by calculating the sum gravitational pull on each given particle. But now you have

71
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,640
a shortcut. When you calculate the effect from distant locations, you don't do it for each

72
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,000
particle. Instead, you do it for all particles inside one of these cubes. The larger the distance,

73
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,560
the larger the cube you can use. Now, this sounds like a complicated process, but now the number

74
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,520
of calculations that you need to do goes down from n squared to n times log n, which for large

75
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,000
particle numbers is much, much faster. Another approach is the particle mesh method, in which

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,600
particles are converted into a density distribution and a gravitational potential across the grid.

77
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,640
The force at each point can then be solved using Fourier transform methods, which can

78
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:29,840
be very fast. Adaptive particle meshes can be used to add higher resolution when needed,

79
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,320
say where the stars have higher density or structure. Modern mesh codes also do classic

80
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:42,000
particle-particle interactions at short ranges to improve accuracy at small scales. These mesh

81
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,120
codes are useful for systems of particles interacting under gravity, but they also work

82
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,440
for another really important astrophysical situation, flowing gas. The universe started

83
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,200
as an ocean of gas a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang. That gas is still everywhere.

84
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,200
It flows into galaxies from beyond where it rides the disk, fragments and collapses into stars.

85
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,480
It forms whirlpools and jets around new stars and black holes. All of these processes are key

86
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:16,560
parts of galaxy evolution and of star and planet formation, and so we'd better be able to simulate

87
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,360
this too. Now we call these hydrodynamic simulations. They simulate the flow of gas

88
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,120
using the equations of fluid dynamics. Particle mesh approaches can do this,

89
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,600
but these days it's more common to use an approach called smoothed particle hydrodynamics,

90
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:41,280
or SPH. SPH codes don't use a rigid grid, but rather they track tracer particles within the

91
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:47,120
fluid. Those particles effectively make up a constantly shifting grid. In astrophysics, SPH

92
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,360
codes are used to simulate the flows of gas in galaxies and around quasars, used to simulate star

93
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,680
and planet formation, and even star and planet destruction in collisions or supernovae. SPH

94
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,520
can even be used to do galaxy formation where the stars themselves are treated as a type of fluid.

95
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,920
In practice, modern simulations often use an amalgam of these methods. For example, SPH for

96
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,320
large-scale flows and particle-particle n-body for small-scale interactions. Astrophysicists

97
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,840
often inject all sorts of other physics into their simulations. In your galaxy simulation,

98
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:30,560
you might need a separate prescription to describe how stars age and die. In your quasar disk,

99
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,080
you need to simulate separately how light travels through the hot plasma, and don't get me started

100
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,360
about the complexity of including magnetic fields or of Einstein's general relativity when the

101
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,800
gravitational field becomes very strong. With the techniques now available, using parallelised

102
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:54,160
code on modern computing clusters, we can compute some pretty insane simulations. We can see how

103
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,080
stars form in multitudes from collapsing gas clouds, and how planets then coalesce in the

104
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,800
disks surrounding those stars. We can watch as galaxies form with gas and dark matter interacting

105
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,960
to produce waves of star formation and supernovae, settling into spiral structures just like we see

106
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,680
in the real universe. And then we have cosmological simulations, which create entire virtual universes,

107
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,040
from the moment the first atoms formed to the modern day. One of the most famous is the

108
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,640
Millennium Simulation from the Max Planck Institute in Germany. It simulated a 13 billion

109
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,280
light-year-wide cube containing over 300 billion particles, each representing a billion sun's

110
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:43,680
worth of dark matter. But the current largest cosmological simulation is Abacus Summit,

111
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,600
which just last year simulated 70 trillion particles on the supercomputers at the Center

112
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:57,440
for Computational Astrophysics in New York. So how far can all of this go? Can we ever simulate

113
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,480
a real universe in which creatures evolve that can themselves simulate universes?

114
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:10,320
In fact, could we be such creatures? Probably not. None of these simulations contain the full

115
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,560
information of an actual universe or even a tiny part of it. As we discussed recently,

116
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,200
a full quantum description of the world contains unthinkably more information than is contained

117
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,000
in a typical simulation, which just tracks particle positions and velocities. No conceivable technology

118
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,080
could fully simulate a quantum universe, except perhaps a cosmologically sized quantum computer,

119
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,240
which is kind of what the universe is anyway. We've talked about this simulation and hypothesis

120
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,520
stuff before, and maybe we'll come back to it. For now, let's just be proud of the science

121
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,880
that we can get from modern simulations, because we've come an awful long way since Eric Holmberg

122
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,640
pushed some light bulbs around on his table. And the fidelity and size of our simulations will

123
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,240
only get better as computing power continues its exponential growth and as we invent better and

124
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,480
better algorithms. Perhaps there is no limit to what we can learn about the outside universe by

125
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,040
rebuilding it inside our computers and then peering into that simulated space time.

Thank you to Ren for supporting PBS. Ren is a website where you calculate your carbon footprint,

127
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,880
then offset it by funding projects that plant trees, protect rainforests, and suck carbon from

128
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,160
the sky. By answering a few questions about your lifestyle, you can find out your carbon footprint

129
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,320
and how you can reduce it. No one can reduce their carbon footprint to zero, so you can offset

130
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,840
what you have left after reducing. Subscribers receive monthly updates from the tree planting,

131
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,200
rainforest protection, and carbon removal projects they support. You can get to see

132
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,480
the trees you planted and what your money is spent on. You can learn more about Ren's
