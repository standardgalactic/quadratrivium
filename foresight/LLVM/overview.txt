Processing Overview for LLVM
============================
Checking LLVM/2023 LLVM Dev Mtg - Mojo ðŸ”¥ï¼š A system programming language for heterogenous computing.txt
1. Mojo is a high-performance MLIR dialect designed to be easy to use and extendable with other LLVM-based MLIR dialects, focusing on two primary upstream dialects: LLVM and Index. It aims to simplify the process of optimizing code for heterogeneous hardware without requiring deep understanding of all target architectures.

2. Mojo provides a predictable interface for performance programmers, allowing them to specify optimizations explicitly while giving control to the user over compiler optimizations. This is in contrast to traditional compilers that might automatically apply optimizations which could conflict with user intent.

3. The default behavior of Mojo is designed to be optimal without explicit user intervention, but any user-specified optimizations or directives will take precedence over the compiler's best guess.

4. Mojo abstracts away the complexity of targeting different hardware accelerators (like ampere, hopper, Volta), so that performance library developers can focus on their area of expertise rather than becoming experts in multiple hardware domains.

5. The approach taken by Mojo is to empower current programmers and performance engineers who are experts in their respective domains, rather than expecting them to also become expert compiler engineers. This is based on the premise that there are more programmers and performance engineers than compiler engineers.

6. Mojo can integrate with other MLIR dialects if needed, providing flexibility for different use cases and hardware targets, but its core design philosophy is to simplify the interaction between high-level code and low-level optimizations without overwhelming the user with options or conflicts.

7. The Mojo project is part of the LLVM and MLIR ecosystem, which continues to evolve and integrate new features and dialects as needed to address performance programming challenges.
