0	5680	In the philosophy of science, constructivism is the perspective that, while reality may exist
5680	11360	independent of our silly little human brains, scientific knowledge is socially constructed.
11360	14720	But definitions are boring. Vibes are far more important.
14720	18960	How do scientists feel about this idea? Let's examine the data.
18960	24720	A perverse doctrine that subordinates rationality to politics and unbridled subjectivity.
24720	30240	An indefensible reduction of all claims about nature to equally contingent status.
30240	35680	A conspiracy of leftist humanists and social scientists against both science and western
35680	41200	civilization. Fascinating. I'm going to go ahead and say that most scientists, you know,
41200	45200	I could be wrong about this, but it's the impression I get from years in the field,
45200	50000	extensive study on the culture of science and, you know, being a person online.
50000	56240	Most scientists don't find constructivism that helpful an idea. But lucky for you, I'm not
56240	60720	most scientists. My doctoral research was in astrophysics, but more recently I've been
60720	66240	publishing papers and making videos about the more social and political aspects of science.
66240	70080	And the whole point that I'm trying to get across is that even the hardest of the hard
70080	75600	sciences are still affected by messy people stuff. And I get the impression that some people are
75600	79600	kind of starting to come around to that idea, especially in fields like medicine or maybe
79600	87280	even technology, but not physics, right? Physics is just the fundamental truth about the universe.
87280	92640	Particles don't care about the political climate. Radiation doesn't discriminate against women.
92640	100080	Gravity isn't a social construct, right? In this video, I'm going to use gravity,
100080	105760	dark matter and a controversial, but in my opinion, compelling theory to illustrate why even the most
105760	112880	objective, rational, definitely not made up facts about the universe are indeed socially constructed.
112880	116640	And don't worry, I'm going to explain what that even means. But it's going to be a lighthearted
116640	120720	and fun video today. I promise this isn't going to end up being about racism or something heavy
120800	126320	like that about God, maybe, but not in the way you think. Just watch it. Trust me, it's going to be a good one.
126320	151840	Before we get into it, I want to lay out a few working definitions because I feel like a lot of
151840	156080	conversations about squishy human subjects like this tend to get stuck on semantics.
156160	160880	And social constructivism is definitely the kind of term that means different things in different
160880	165360	contexts. So if you're mostly here for the physics, bear with me for just a little while I talk about
166320	173120	sociology. Social constructivism is broadly the idea that the natural world just kind of exists,
173120	178480	and then scientific knowledge is what we create in our attempt to model the natural world,
178480	184560	but it is not the same as transcendent truth about the natural world. In other words,
184560	189200	knowledge is something we construct. One way to build a stronger intuition for what this means
189200	195440	is to consider the opposite philosophy, objectivism. Not that weird like A&Rand objectivism where
195440	200720	productivity is man's most noble calling or whatever. The scientific objectivist belief
200720	204880	that us mere mortals can in fact deduce fundamental truths about the universe
204880	209840	transcendent of approximations or models. But like many things in the social sciences,
209840	214800	these philosophies exist on a spectrum. On one end of the spectrum we have objectivism,
214800	220640	and on the other end strong constructivism. The two genders. Strong constructivism is where an
220640	226080	objective observer independent reality just doesn't exist. Or at least that us humans are
226080	232160	indelibly incapable of accessing it so it might as well not exist. Closer to the objectivist end,
232160	238640	we can consider a weak constructivism that proposes the goals of science at any given time can be
238640	243760	reflective of the surrounding culture or the vague claim that individual scientists work will
243760	248320	tend to follow the money. But somewhere between the weak and strong versions we have a whole lot
248320	253760	of epistemological question marks that constructivist analyses aim to answer. When does an experiment
253760	258480	sufficiently capture a natural phenomenon? What happens when theories conflict with each other?
258480	264560	How are unexpected outlying data points interpreted? And critically, how are any of these things
264560	269200	influenced by the people who are doing them? I've talked in videos before about the strong
269200	274160	constructivist end and the weak constructivist end, so today I'm concerning myself with this middle
274160	279920	area that's less about the nature of reality or the influence of politics and more about the choices
279920	285520	made in the process of conducting scientific research. In Act 1 we'll look at the science.
285520	290320	We'll go through a brief history of gravity, do a little primer on dark matter, and introduce a
290320	295120	theory that is attempting to challenge it. In Act 2 we'll get to more of the social side.
295120	298800	We'll learn how the scientific method is actually kind of messy,
298800	303120	get into how this messiness opens up space for subjective interpretations,
303120	307600	and look at what kinds of things can influence those interpretations.
307600	312880	We're going straight philosophy of physics today, and I for one am very excited.
323440	328160	Everyone ever has known that gravity exists. I want to like drop something as a demonstration,
328160	330000	but I don't actually have anything I want to drop.
331760	336080	Gravity. Even animals know what gravity is, at least to the extent that their behavior is
336080	340320	obviously informed by its existence. Like have you ever seen a cat do a really precise
340320	344800	jump over something? You can't tell me that that cat doesn't understand what parabolic
344800	349200	motion is just as well as any intro physics college student. Maybe not in equations or
349200	354720	words, but as an experience for sure. Arguably the only beings to ever not intuitively understand
354720	359040	that gravity exists are astronauts who just got back to earth and haven't yet remembered that
359040	363040	they can't just put things down in midair. Now you know you've got the space station right up there
363280	369120	that- I start with this comically basic understanding of what gravity is because
369120	373520	some people will inevitably try to counter the whole social construct thing with this level
373520	378320	of arguments. About it just being so obviously real and clearly not made up. So I bring up these
378320	383040	silly examples to illustrate the difference between some inarguably self-evident shared
383040	388720	experience and specific scientific descriptions of something, which is the part that I'm arguing
388720	393920	is socially constructed. Me, you, and the cat can all agree that there is definitely some
394480	400800	fundamentally real thing that makes some things fall into other things, but that is different
400800	405200	than a scientific theory and it precedes any attempt to characterize it. The earliest written
405200	409520	descriptions of gravity come from Greece and the Indian subcontinent and don't get much more advanced
409520	414720	than vague notions of things tend to fall down towards the earth instead of up towards the sky.
414720	419760	Neat. Eventually people started using numbers to describe this tendency more precisely and came
419760	425120	to the conclusion that things fall down towards the earth at an acceleration of about 9.8 meters
425120	429040	per second squared. The first mathematical formulation of gravity is often attributed
429040	434880	to Gal Leo in the 17th century, but his work was built on 11th century polymath Ibn Sina's work on
434880	440000	projectile motion, as well as 12th century polymath Abul Barakat al-Bardadi's relations between
440000	444480	acceleration and force. Really bummed that I missed the era of interdisciplinary Middle Eastern
444480	450160	scientists or artist scientists like Da Vinci actually helped this whole gravity progression
450160	456000	along in between painting seminal masterpieces. Da Vinci? Today's physicists can never. So with
456000	461600	this first quantitative description of gravity, we went from being able to predict that if you drop
461600	467360	something it will hit the ground to if you drop something this is how long it will take to hit
467360	473680	the ground. We did it. We made science. However, as mathematically rigorous as this description was,
473680	479680	it had limitations. The acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 ish meters per second squared that we use
479680	485600	in an intro physics class actually varies depending on latitude. Someone in Ecuador for example would
485600	489920	measure a slightly different gravitational acceleration than someone in Sweden and both of
489920	494720	them would measure something completely different than someone on say the surface of Mars. So while
494720	501040	this formulation of gravity was true enough to like hit a rival ship with a cannonball or something,
501040	506480	it was by no means internationally true, let alone universally true. We didn't get that until a guy
506480	512000	named Isaac iterated on the work of Galileo and another guy who thought therefore he was and came
512000	517760	up with what we now refer to as Newton's law of universal gravitation. Universal because this
517760	522880	description wasn't specific to gravity on the surface of the earth. Newton's formulation described
522880	528400	the gravitational force between any two bodies with mass, you and the earth, the earth and the sun,
528400	533280	Jupiter and the Galilean moons, whatever. Any two objects with mass will experience a
533280	539120	gravitational attraction between them that increases with either objects mass and decreases
539120	544160	with the distance separating them. Boom, we figured it out, but for real this time. We've cracked the
544160	549680	code to predict not only the motion of objects here on earth, but the orbits of the celestial bodies
549680	554960	and theoretically anything else in the universe with mass. We're definitely right this time.
554960	559280	But again, while more broadly useful than the previous Galilean formulation,
559920	565920	Newton's law of universal gravitation wasn't quite as universal as he thought. For example,
565920	571680	in the 1800s astronomers had measured the orbit of the planet Mercury so precisely that they found
571680	577040	it to be inconsistent with what Newton's law of universal gravitation would predict. So they figured
577040	583120	that there has to be another planet in closer to the sun. Spoiler alert, there was no such planet.
583120	587680	It wasn't until Albert Einstein developed his theories of relativity at the start of the 20th
587680	593200	century that Mercury's weird orbit could be explained. The TLDR of relativity is that the
593200	600160	rates at which time passes can be altered by extremely high speeds or strong gravity. Time is
600160	606320	relative, so everything else is too. Relativity is trippy and weird and too complicated to explain
606320	611600	here, but the important thing that you need to know for our purposes is that we were able to make
611600	616880	even more precise predictions about gravity with it. And many experiments have supported
616880	621120	Einstein's theories of relativity. From Eddington's observations of gravitational
621120	626320	lensing during a solar eclipse in 1919 to measurements of stellar orbits around the
626320	631360	supermassive black hole SAJ star in the middle of our galaxy made just a few years ago. So we're
631360	637440	definitely right this time. As powerful as this set of theories is, even it has shortcomings.
637440	642480	Most famously, the relativistic construction of gravity is incompatible with quantum mechanics,
642480	647360	which is arguably the other most successful set of theories to come out of the last century of
647360	653440	physics. Both of these paradigms make extremely robust predictions in their own regimes. Relativity
653440	659200	describing interactions between the most massive objects like stars and black holes and quantum
659200	664720	mechanics describing interactions between the smallest things like particles and light waves.
664720	668960	But they break down if you try to consider them together because they each make different assumptions
668960	673760	about the underlying nature of reality. In quantum mechanics, causality is statistical,
673760	679040	almost random seeming. The rate of time passage is static, and the universe has some baseline
679040	684240	resolution, as if it's made out of really tiny pixels. For relativity to work, however, causality
684240	690000	is necessarily deterministic. One cause can yield only one effect. Time is relative, like we said
690000	696160	before, and the universe is continuous. There isn't some minimum size or mass that things can be.
696160	700320	This is a great opportunity to point out the problem with thinking of scientific knowledge as
700320	705680	either right or wrong. A naive, if not kind of understandable, reaction to these conflicting
705680	710640	theories might be to say, well, if they contradict, one of them must be wrong. But the reality is that
710640	716800	they both work. They both have predictive power. But each one has a particular context in which
716800	722160	its predictive power is reliable. In fact, it doesn't really make sense to call earlier theories of
722160	727920	gravity wrong either. Newtonian gravity works for certain contexts. Galilean gravity works for
727920	732320	certain contexts. Hell, even the ancient Greek models that were barely more sophisticated than a
732320	737760	cat's understanding of gravity works in certain contexts. I mean, the cat got over the thing,
737760	742240	didn't it? Sometimes the cat knowledge is enough. Each model accounts for the knowledge that was
742240	748800	available at the time and was iterated on as our new discoveries and ideas illuminated our ignorance.
748800	752960	And it's easy to look at this history of gravity and feel like we're coming closer and closer to
752960	758400	the truth. But in reality, it only seems like that in hindsight. When you learn a lineage of
758400	763440	increasingly successful theories in a physics class or science documentary, you generally don't learn
763440	768400	about the false darts and failed ideas that were necessary to get us to where we are today.
768400	773440	So to complicate matters a bit, we're going to shift gears into a modern problem in astrophysics
773440	777680	that continues to illuminate our ignorance about gravity, dark matter.
784880	789120	So I'm going to go ahead and hazard a guess that most of you have heard of dark matter before and
789120	794160	are at least vaguely aware of it as something that probably exists. As another astrophysical lady
794160	798320	YouTuber who I get compared to a whole lot has explained in a recent video of hers,
798320	803440	dark matter is not a theory, it is an observation. For our purposes today, I'm only going to explain
803440	808560	one of these observations as a mental foothold for my broader argument, but I will refer to some of
808560	813520	these other observations a little in passing. So if you want a more solid baseline explanation of the
813520	818400	full set of observations, go check out her video, if for no other reason than to hear the dark matter
819040	824720	dark matter. Do we need it? What is it? Where is it? How much iconic? So what is this observation
824720	829920	that we call dark matter? The graph I'm going to use to explain this is called a rotation curve,
829920	834800	and it shows how the speed objects in orbit around something changes as they get farther
834800	840080	away from that thing. So if we were to make a rotation curve of the solar system, for example,
840080	845600	this axis would be each planet's distance from the sun and each point's height would tell us how
845600	851360	fast the planet is orbiting. And we have a trend. The further the planet is, the slower it orbits,
851360	856320	because the force due to gravity, which is what's driving the orbit, gets weaker with distance.
856320	861280	But it's slightly more complicated than that. The mass that gravitationally drives the orbital
861280	866960	speed isn't just the thing in the center, it's everything inside the orbit. But because the sun
866960	873040	is so much more massive than even all the planets put together, the difference in mass inside Mercury's
873040	878720	orbit and the mass inside Pluto's orbit isn't that important. So the variation we see in this
878720	883760	rotation curve is mostly just because of the changing distance. If we were to make the same
883760	888880	graph for a galaxy rather than a solar system, we would expect the curve to look a little bit
888880	893520	different. Because the mass isn't as concentrated in the center, the further you get, the more
893520	898400	stuff you're orbiting, so instead of the graph dropping off quickly, it holds up for a while.
898400	902720	But once you get to the edge of the galaxy where there's not that much more stuff being added,
902720	907440	the graph should begin to drop. Or at least that's what we would have expected. Turns out,
907440	911840	when we measure the speeds of the furthest out orbiting stars and gas in galaxies,
911840	916240	they're going much faster than we'd expect, as if there was a lot more stuff inside those
916240	922000	far out orbits than we can see. And that difference between the rotation curve we'd predict based on
922000	927600	the mass of the matter we can see in the galaxy, and the actual rotation curve we get when we measure
927600	936960	how fast things are moving, is what we call dark matter. The term dark matter is simply a label
936960	942160	for a particular way in which our understanding of the universe is wrong. It is exactly this
942160	948640	wrong, and that wrongness is what dark matter is. It's not a theory, it's a set of observations,
948640	953040	and this is one of them. Now everything I've said so far is just kind of categorically true.
953040	957840	This is the prediction that our currently accepted models of gravity expect, and this
957840	962640	is the measurement we see when we try to test those models. Neither of these things is really up for
962640	965920	debate. I mean, I could probably make it up for debate, but I won't. But even though what I'm
965920	970880	about to say next could be found in any intro astronomy textbook, I want to mark this point
970880	977280	as the end of me sharing facts about dark matter, and the beginning of me sharing theories about
977280	980960	dark matter. There's a difference, and it will make more sense as we go. Would it be a mixing
980960	984640	metaphor as if I said we're now crossing the event horizon? Whatever, I'm a physicist,
984640	989440	not a poet. So the prevailing explanation for why these two curves look different is because
989440	994400	there's some invisible stuff in galaxies. And if this were to be the case, there are two things
994400	999440	we could confidently say about it. First, that it doesn't interact electromagnetically. It doesn't
999440	1004880	emit light, or absorb light, or reflect light, and is therefore completely undetectable in images
1004880	1009520	that rely on light coming from an object. Or according to some theories, it doesn't interact
1009520	1016640	electromagnetically much. Hence, dark. And second, it does interact gravitationally. Because it's
1016640	1022800	causing these gravitational effects on orbits, it must have mass, which means it must be some kind
1022800	1030800	of matter. Thus, dark matter. Stuff with mass that we cannot see. Hard to see stuff. And that's a fine
1030800	1036160	idea. But there's kind of a big hole in it, and that's that we don't have any real idea of what
1036160	1041840	it actually is. There are a ton of different models for what dark matter is, but none of them explain
1041840	1047680	the observations completely. Some theories model dark matter as a kind of particle, like axions,
1047680	1054160	or gravatinos, or what somebody very cleverly named, weakly interacting massive particles.
1054160	1059280	Feels like projection. Presumably playing off that pun, somebody proposed a theory for dark matter
1059280	1064800	in which it was made of large, dark objects like black holes or brown dwarfs. Instead of a fluid
1064880	1071360	of particles naming them massive, compact, halo objects. So at one point, the competing theories
1071360	1076720	for dark matter were wimps and machos. This is an astronomer's idea of a good joke, by the way.
1076720	1081600	This is astronomy culture. And it's not like a nickname or something. The title of the paper
1081600	1086800	I published once has the word macho in it twice because of the name of the events I'm analyzing.
1086800	1091280	I was looking for black holes and the data I used to identify them came from the macho project,
1091280	1095680	because black holes could maybe be a kind of macho. So the maybe black holes from my thesis
1095680	1100240	are named things like macho 96 bulge 5. I always had more hope in that one. I was never convinced
1100240	1106000	by macho 98 bulge 6. At 100,000 subscribers, I'll do a video about my old astrophysics research.
1106000	1111440	So if you want to hear more about this overdone tangent, smash that subscribe button. I hate myself
1111440	1115600	when I do this sometimes. Sorry, the pun thing really got me going. So some people think dark
1115600	1120560	matter is an invisible particle. Some people think it's big dark things. Some people think it's a
1120560	1125600	fifth dimension that somehow makes everything make sense. There are theories of cold dark matter
1125600	1131040	and hot dark matter and even warm dark matter. My personal favorite theory is that of primordial
1131040	1135840	black holes, which are like teeny tiny little black holes that formed right after the Big Bang,
1135840	1140960	because I think it's cute. The Uwu theory of dark matter, if you will. This must be what Contra
1140960	1144800	points felt like when she said Squidwardian. Are we really saying that's word out loud? To an
1144800	1149760	audience of millions? Okay. But here's the problem. None of these theories of dark matter on their
1149760	1154800	own can explain all our observations. Like I said earlier, there are other kinds of observations
1154800	1159680	besides the rotation curves of galaxies that point to some undetectable mass of an unknown
1159680	1165040	nature. And different models of what dark matter actually is are better able to explain the different
1165040	1170960	observations. This vulcanization of theories is not dissimilar from the story of luminiferous ether,
1170960	1176000	which 19th century physicists used to explain how light traveled through empty space. Just like
1176000	1181040	with dark matter, some effectively invisible material was predicted in order to explain
1181040	1185920	unexpected experimental results. And the models fractured further and further until everybody
1185920	1190160	had an ether theory to match their favorite observation. And just like with ether, some
1190160	1195280	scholars have called this multiplicity of models a crisis for the dark matter community, contrasting
1195280	1199760	the minimal evidence of any one model with the massive amounts of effort that have gone to
1199760	1204000	experimentally testing them. Dark matter is one of those particles that for decades physicists
1204000	1208640	have been saying they're going to find it in the next 10 years. And haven't. We just need to build
1208640	1213280	a particle collider the size of Earth's orbit. Then we'll find it. Given everything I've learned
1213280	1218080	about dark matter, I'm inclined to agree with astrophysicists more to hide Milgram's take on the
1218080	1225280	search. If one does not presuppose anything about what dark matter is, about what its interactions
1225280	1232240	with baryons and with itself are, besides gravity, and about how it got to where it is,
1232960	1239040	then it is hard to rule out. My God, the shade. He's kind of right, though. It is pretty hard to
1239040	1243040	rule out a theory when you have no evidence. And you might be thinking, but what about those
1243040	1248320	rotation curves? We learned a whole graph for it. Isn't that evidence of something? Well, it could be.
1248320	1250480	Or we could just be wrong about gravity again.
1250880	1262400	Remember earlier when I said that Mercury had a weird orbit and that in order to explain it,
1262400	1267040	astronomers predicted there might be another planet closer into the sun? So even though this was
1267040	1271040	wrong, there was good context for it. French mathematician and astronomer,
1271040	1277280	Urban Leverrier, Urban Leverrier, Urbane Leverrier, whatever his name was, the guy who identified
1277280	1282800	Mercury's weird orbit had actually predicted the existence of Neptune just a few years earlier
1282800	1288320	based on weirdness in Uranus's orbit. He used Newtonian gravity to analyze the orbit of Uranus
1288320	1292560	and found it to be slightly off from what the observers were measuring, so he deduced that
1292560	1297920	there must be another planet there that nobody had seen yet, causing these gravitational perturbations.
1297920	1302880	And there was. He sent his calculations to an observer who identified Neptune literally that
1302880	1307920	same evening. Truly a testament of Newtonian mechanics' predictive power. So when he found
1307920	1313440	similar gravitational anomalies in Mercury's orbit, he theorized that there may be, once again,
1313440	1317680	an unidentified planet to blame. And since he was so successful last time he did that,
1317680	1322320	the community went all in. The search began, sub-theories proliferated, and they even gave
1322320	1327520	the putative planet a name, Vulcan. There's a weirdly high rate of almost having things called
1327520	1332080	Vulcan in astronomy. Some of it precedes Star Trek. But as we know today, there is no planet
1332080	1336240	Vulcan. And it wasn't until a century later that Einstein's theories of relativity came
1336240	1342160	along to explain why. Newtonian gravity just wasn't adequate to predict an orbit as close
1342160	1346800	into the Sun's gravitational influence as Mercury. I share this example of planet predictions
1346800	1352320	because it illustrates two diverging responses to failed experiments. You make a prediction,
1352320	1356240	you take a measurement, your prediction doesn't match your measurements. What do you do? Well,
1356240	1361280	when it came to Uranus, the answer was to imagine what other stuff might be affecting the data and
1361280	1366000	then look for that stuff. And sometimes that works. But when it came to Mercury, it wasn't that there
1366000	1372000	was unaccounted for stuff. It was that the theory the predictions were based on was inadequate.
1372000	1377200	Do you see where I'm going with this? On the whole, the astronomy community in the last century-ish
1377200	1381200	has determined that in order to resolve the difference between what we see and what we
1381200	1386880	predict in galaxies, there must be some stuff out there that we're not seeing. Neptune must exist,
1386880	1391520	so to speak. But what if dark matter isn't like Neptune? What if it's like Mercury? What if the
1391520	1396960	assumptions we use to make this were just wrong? Well, that guy Milgram, who's brutal dressing
1396960	1401680	down of the search for dark matter, I just quoted, kind of developed a whole theory for this. It's
1401680	1408160	called Modified Newtonian Dynamics, or MOND, and it's an alternate explanation for the dark matter
1408160	1412800	observations that makes adjustments to our understanding of gravity instead of inventing
1412880	1419280	invisible ether stuff. Milgram published his first paper on MOND in 1983, 50 years after the term
1419280	1424000	dark matter was coined by Fritz Zwicky. And while, as I'll get to in a minute, it's not exactly a
1424000	1429520	popular theory, it is legitimate insofar as there are hundreds of peer-reviewed papers on it. It's
1429520	1433440	fringe, but it's decidedly not in crackpot territory. Now, I'm not going to get into the
1433440	1438800	mathematics here, mostly because I refuse to ever show an equation on this channel on principle,
1438800	1444800	but in the same way that Einstein's relativity usurped Newtonian mechanics because it was more
1444800	1451040	broadly applicable in the situations of extremely high speed or gravity, MOND proposes additions
1451040	1455920	that also account for very low accelerations, which becomes more relevant when you're considering
1455920	1460240	things on the size scale of galaxies, for example. If you want all the math, you can go read the
1460240	1464160	papers yourself. My references are in the description. I feel like when my old college
1464160	1469040	professors would like introduce an idea and be like, and you can go home and do the derivation
1469040	1474640	for fun if you want. And it's like, what nerds actually did that? I did that. The important
1474640	1478960	thing is that by making tweaks to our current understanding of gravity, we would be able to
1478960	1483520	make predictions for the rotation curves of galaxies that match our observations better.
1483520	1489600	But like previous changes to gravity, MOND doesn't negate what came before it so much as add to it.
1489600	1494480	MOND makes gravity predictable in a wider range of situations, and there's actually
1494480	1499520	decently compelling evidence for MOND. Unlike most models of dark matter, people have actually used
1499520	1505280	it to make successful predictions in advance of seeing data instead of adapting to data after
1505280	1508880	the fact, which you would think would be an important quality to consider when evaluating
1508880	1513280	competing theories, but as we'll get to later, not the most important. And to be clear, I'm not
1513280	1518080	going to sit here and pretend that MOND is definitely the more correct hypothesis. I think the strongest
1518080	1522560	argument against it is that it can't account for everything. In particular, it's not very good at
1522560	1527760	explaining the cosmological scale dark matter observations that I didn't get into because
1527760	1533520	this video needs some bounds. But when it comes to galaxy scale observations like our rotation curves,
1533520	1538720	papers published as recently as last year argue that MOND actually works better than any one model
1538720	1543120	of dark matter. I should also mention that there are more theories of modified gravity than just
1543120	1547280	MOND, and some of them do a better job with the cosmology stuff. Kind of similar to how there
1547360	1552160	are many models of dark matter that each do better or worse at explaining different pieces of evidence.
1552160	1556320	I'll just say MOND for the rest of the video, but know that I'm using it as a shorthand to
1556320	1562320	refer to the multiplicity of models that solve dark matter by updating gravity rather than
1562320	1568800	inventing space ether. But as interesting as this theory is, the field doesn't really like it. As in,
1569360	1574720	and forgive me for generalizing, but most astronomers do not take MOND seriously as an
1574720	1581040	option for explaining dark matter. Anecdotally, I can say that in my 10 years studying astrophysics,
1581040	1586640	I had only ever heard MOND referred to once in earnest, and any other time I had heard anybody
1586640	1592000	mention it, it's been as a joke. Like, look at those kooky MOND researchers who think they're
1592000	1600160	gonna solve gravity. So silly. Who's even funding them? MOND is like astronomy's embarrassing cousin
1600160	1606240	that gets lumped in with ET research and is like in the space of technically legitimate but
1606240	1611040	effectively crackpotty? Actually, that's not true. People respect SETI. I'm gonna go out on a limb
1611040	1616480	and say most astronomers take them more seriously than they do the MOND people. But beyond my own
1616480	1620960	personal experience, you just have to look at an astronomy textbook to see the institutional
1620960	1626960	erasure of MOND as a viable solution for dark matter. Here's what my first astro textbook
1626960	1632560	says about dark matter. To explain these nearly uniform orbital speeds in the outer parts of the
1632560	1639280	galaxy, astronomers conclude that a large amount of matter must lie outside the sun's orbit.
1639280	1644160	This unseen material, which is by far the predominant constituent of our galaxy,
1644160	1652080	is called dark matter. Not astronomers hypothesize. Not astronomers are evaluating. Astronomers
1652080	1658960	conclude there is unseen material and is called dark matter. I looked through all of my old textbooks
1658960	1665440	that I had lying around and all of them had sections on, you know, dark matter that described
1665440	1672000	machos and wimps and axions and all that stuff, but literally no mention of the possibility of
1672000	1678000	other formulations of gravity. Curious. Finally, we can compare the distribution of papers published
1678000	1683840	on each topic. Doing a quick search on NASA ADS, which is the place to search for astrophysics
1683840	1690000	articles, we get nearly 80,000 hits for papers with the keywords dark matter and only 1,600
1690000	1695040	with the keyword MOND. That's a difference of nearly two orders of magnitude. That's huge.
1695040	1701040	I bring all this up. MOND's complete absence from textbooks, the relative lack of research
1701040	1706000	conducted on it and the way it's literally treated as a joke by people I know. To support the claim
1706000	1711200	that as a community, the field of astrophysics has made a choice. And I'm not saying that the
1711200	1715920	Council of Astronomers who demoted Pluto got together again to suppress MOND. I'm saying that
1715920	1721680	we hit this phenomenological fork in the road, the dark matter observations, and we had the options
1721680	1728320	of inventing something or adjusting our models. And despite what I see as a good amount of compelling
1728320	1734080	but non-conclusive evidence supporting the validity of either option, the field has very clearly
1734080	1739040	made a decision. And this is really interesting to me because it is such a good example of the
1739040	1745360	problem in thinking that science is some linear march towards objective truth where we get closer
1745360	1752480	and closer to the end by using our manly emotionless rationality. That attitude towards science lacks
1752480	1758160	the complexity of making choices. Like a great philosopher once said, everybody got choices.
1758160	1762960	Even scientists got choices. Is that a particle we didn't see? Take another shot of modified
1763920	1768320	gravity? That was a pretty deep cut, but I couldn't not. And I cannot stress this enough.
1768320	1774720	Those choices are not a failure of the scientific method. In fact, they're necessary for the pursuit
1774720	1780160	of science to go anywhere at all. Wow, what a cliffhanger. I don't know about you, but I'm excited
1780160	1783840	to see where this is going. But before we get to that, I got to do my least favorite part of the
1783840	1788560	video. The part where I give you the uncomfortable choice of paying for the content you're watching
1788560	1793600	or not. See, I have this kind of idealistic belief that if I make something good and put it out into
1793600	1798640	the world, then enough people will volunteer to pay me for it that I can keep it free for everybody
1798640	1803680	who can't and not have to succumb to the various sponsor requests in my inbox. Because wouldn't
1803680	1807440	it be cool if I could get paid for my work without trying to sell my viewers something they probably
1807440	1813200	don't want or need? I think so. But I do understand it's a choice. Some reasons one might choose not
1813200	1818000	to support me on Patreon are because they can't afford $3 a month, because they don't think the
1818000	1822960	videos I make are worth that, or because they're three raccoons in a trenchcoat and don't understand
1822960	1828480	the idea of compensation. I know my sincerity reads a sarcasm sometimes, but I really do sympathize
1828480	1832720	with all those reasons. Especially the raccoon one, you would have no idea what's going on.
1832720	1838080	But some reasons one might choose to subscribe to my Patreon are to watch exclusive videos,
1838080	1843440	where I answer questions patrons ask me or interview other creators, get access to the
1843440	1849440	ad-free versions of my video essays, and help me pay my bills while still making this YouTube stuff.
1849440	1853920	Both choices are valid, and while they're certainly one that I'd prefer, I do understand
1853920	1857840	that there can be good reasons either way. So to those already supporting me on Patreon,
1857840	1862880	thank you. You're amazing. To those who already know they won't, that's fine. I'm still glad
1862880	1868000	you're here. And to those considering it, you are the population who will determine how long I
1868000	1872720	can keep doing this. No pressure. Just trying to help you make informed decisions. Okay, that's enough
1872720	1878160	discussion of like personal finance choices. Let's get back to the fun stuff. Science choices.
1887840	1891600	So I know a lot of people think that science is just the straightforward application of the
1891600	1898400	scientific method, and that's very cute. The fact that this is only kind of sometimes what the process
1898400	1903440	of scientific research looks like is a huge topic that I will probably make a whole video about
1903440	1908800	whenever I get around to reading against method. But today, I want to draw our attention to that
1908800	1914800	ineffable initiation of inquiry, the hypothesis. The formulation of a hypothesis has been called
1914800	1919520	the most mysterious step of the scientific method, because it's kind of hard to explain
1919520	1924960	exactly where a hypothesis comes from, how a hypothesis is constructed, if you will. The
1924960	1930240	choice of a hypothesis is so crucial to the whole scientific process, because what you choose to
1930240	1935680	study determines what you're gonna find out. This is especially important when you have multiple
1935680	1940720	or conflicting hypotheses. How do you decide which one to point the scientific method at?
1940720	1946400	One might naively think, well, just systematically test all the hypotheses in whichever is the most
1946400	1951440	successful determines where your theory goes. So objective. But the inherent futility of this
1951440	1956800	strategy is exactly what drove philosopher Robert Piercig, who was a university biochemistry student
1956800	1962720	at the age of only 15, to abandon science entirely after only a few years of research. While doing
1962720	1968800	laboratory work, he became obsessed with the idea of hypotheses in and of themselves, and in particular,
1968800	1974320	their tendency to multiply. As you test one hypothesis, he realized, many more hypotheses will
1974320	1978880	come to mind. And then when you go to test the first of those, you would get hit by yet another
1978880	1984560	flood of hypotheses. The more science you do, the more untested hypotheses you have. At first,
1984560	1989360	he thought this was amusing and came up with like a jokie law saying that the number of rational
1989360	1995840	hypotheses that can explain any given phenomenon is infinite. But over time, his amusement transformed
1995840	2002240	into a deep nihilism about scientific reasoning and its potential to lead humans to true knowledge
2002240	2007440	of nature. If the purpose of the scientific method is to select from among a multitude of
2007440	2013440	hypotheses, and if the number of hypotheses grows faster than experimental method can handle,
2013440	2019520	then it is clear that all hypotheses can never be tested. If all hypotheses cannot be tested,
2019520	2025120	then the results of any experiment are inconclusive, and the entire scientific method falls short of
2025120	2031200	its goal of establishing proven knowledge. Establishing proven knowledge. How much you
2031200	2034560	want to bet Piercig was one of those science students who picked the subject because of how
2034560	2039040	much he likes that there's only one single definite answer to each question. I say that
2039040	2043440	like I wasn't also that student at one point. I thought I was so clever just choosing to learn
2043440	2050240	absolute truths about the universe. For Piercig, this realization of infinite hypotheses along
2050240	2055680	with the lack of rational tools to choose between them was catastrophic for his ability to do science.
2055680	2060480	And I guess because he couldn't reconcile these complications with what I'm assuming was his starting
2060480	2066640	point of dogmatic scientific rationalism and objective truth-seeking, he dropped out of university
2066640	2071120	just a few years later. But others have realized these complicating aspects of science without
2071120	2076800	having existential crises. For example, in The Island of Knowledge, The Limits of Science and
2076800	2082400	the Search for Meaning, Brazilian astrophysicist Marcelo Gleiser uses a metaphor of an island
2082400	2087920	to describe how increasing knowledge actually takes us further from a final truth.
2087920	2093040	As The Island of Knowledge grows, so do the shores of our ignorance, the boundary between
2093040	2098160	the known and unknown. Learning more about the world doesn't lead to a point closer to a final
2098160	2104080	destination, whose existence is nothing but a hopeful assumption anyways, but to more questions
2104080	2109920	and mysteries. According to Gleiser, Piercig's problem of infinite hypotheses wasn't a flaw
2109920	2115680	of the scientific method so much as a fundamental feature of human's knowledge acquisition. By
2115680	2121520	seeking more and more information, we're not converging on truth, but fractaling out into
2121520	2125920	complexity. The more you know, the more you know you don't know.
2133920	2139040	So if trying to answer questions leads to more questions, and if we only have finite time and
2139040	2145280	resources to attempt answering some questions, then we still need to figure out how do we choose
2145360	2150160	which hypotheses to pursue. Well, we've talked about Einstein's sum in this video and he seems
2150160	2154720	to have landed on some pretty good theories, so what did he think about how we should find our
2154720	2161120	way to the best truths? The supreme task is to arrive at those universal elementary laws,
2161120	2166240	from which the cosmos can be built up by pure deduction. There is no logical path to these
2166240	2172960	laws. Only intuition, resting on sympathetic understanding of experience, can reach them.
2172960	2178800	Intuition? Sympathetic understanding? What do you think all the Einstein fanboys would think if
2178800	2183920	they knew their physics god believed that feelings are how we solve the universe? Einstein's not
2183920	2188320	the only one who says this, by the way. In his writings on how theories are modified over time,
2188320	2193200	the French physicist and philosopher Pierre Duem suggests that scientists have to follow their
2193200	2198880	good sense. And this was directly in response to the philosophical question of how to decide
2198880	2204400	if a challenged theory should change in its foundational premises or the surrounding assumptions.
2204400	2207840	In other words, the exact kind of fork in the road we see with dark matter and
2207840	2212320	bond. Do we go back and revise or do we press on and add more? At the present moment,
2212320	2216160	I don't think we have enough evidence in either direction to know for sure, but as I've already
2216160	2222240	argued, a decision has been made. And while I agree with Einstein and Duem's ideas of some kind of
2222240	2227360	intellectual intuition that guides us through the inherently open-ended parts of the scientific
2227360	2232640	method, and unlike Piercig, I believe that it's fine for this to be how science works and not
2232640	2238320	evidence of its failure, I think there's an important difference between an individual scientist
2238320	2245520	going off vibes and a collection of scientists going off vibes in a patterned way. Or there would
2245520	2251200	be if there was actually such a thing as an individual scientist. You see, despite their aura of pure
2251200	2254720	objectivity, scientists also live in a society.
2262000	2266880	So now that we have some context, I want to come back to this question of what does it mean for
2266880	2271520	science to be socially constructed. Like I said at the top of this video, today I'm interested
2271520	2276720	in the mid-strength constructivist regime that claims the substance of scientific theories can
2276800	2281200	be influenced by social factors. And I have a really good example of this that is not at all
2281200	2286240	related to astrophysics. Science historian Everett Mendelssohn has done some really fascinating work
2286240	2293120	analyzing the socio-political forces that led to a reductionist approach to biology in 1840s Germany,
2293120	2298160	a time and place characterized by significant political unrest, emerging revolutionary movements,
2298160	2304480	and an anti-autocratic energy among the youths. Mendelssohn argued that this particular social
2304480	2310000	milieu, the same one that produced a young Karl Marx in fact, resulted in a young,
2310000	2314960	alienated intellectual group that sought to create counter concepts. Whether through science or
2314960	2320880	politics, they wanted to challenge the old order and their explanations for the world. Reductionism,
2320880	2325280	the idea that you can best understand things by breaking them down to their fundamental pieces,
2325280	2330160	was at the time considered controversial and revolutionary and therefore was in line with
2330160	2335520	the counter-cultural moment. And that's cool, I guess. The interesting part is that at the exact
2335520	2341440	same time, biologists in France were having their own scientific revolution, except their shift was
2341440	2348800	towards a holistic, organismic paradigm of biology, which is the antithetical approach to reductionism,
2348800	2353440	their opposites. Or at least they were opposite at the time. Apparently modern biology has made
2353440	2357280	some advances towards synthesizing the two approaches, which is cool. Good for them.
2357280	2361200	Shout out to the biologists who read the script for me. Of the stark difference between French
2361200	2367600	and German biological paradigms, Mendelssohn says, The very existence of such a marked difference
2367600	2373680	almost demands a parallel investigation of the mix of cognitive, institutional, and social factors
2373680	2377840	west of the Rhine. You'll have to read his papers for a more detailed explanation of what
2377840	2383040	those factors were, but the important thing here is that differences in the social, political,
2383120	2390000	or institutional contexts led to differences in the approach to formulating scientific theories.
2390000	2396080	The dark matter, Mend's split, is to an extent an analogous situation. Two antithetical paradigms
2396080	2400480	for solving a science problem. But the dichotomy is less visible because of what I think is the
2400480	2405920	monopolizing tendency of American research. Interestingly, more of the top-sided Mend research
2405920	2410960	comes from outside of the US as opposed to the top-sided dark matter research, so maybe the split
2410960	2414880	here isn't as clear as Germany versus France, and it's more like the United States research
2414880	2420400	industrial complex versus a small population of random foreign scientists. I'm not sure about
2420400	2425360	that detail, but the point is, different contexts leads to different science. And I'm going to get
2425360	2431520	to my theory on the context that produced the dark matter choice, but first, I want to touch on why
2431520	2436560	this kind of analysis matters at all. Because the social constructedness of science doesn't just
2436640	2442880	dictate how science happens, it also determines how it will interact with the rest of society.
2442880	2449200	For example, via policy, education, or public communication. There are so many situations
2449200	2454000	where the subjective decision-making necessary to do science has been socially influenced in
2454000	2459440	negative ways. The choice of how much effort to invest in researching a cure for AIDS in the 80s.
2459440	2463760	Or the existence of completely legitimate scientific research that exists solely to sell
2463760	2468080	particular food products. Or the kinds of algorithms and software that venture capital
2468080	2472560	is investing in right now. Or the decision to launch the space shuttle challenger when they did.
2472560	2476480	That one's actually really interesting. There's a whole argument that the particular ways in
2476480	2481280	which people were visualizing data in order to communicate to project leadership is why
2482480	2487760	what happened happened. And, you know, data visualization is definitely a subjective choice.
2487760	2492000	I should do a video on that. Comment below if you want a video on data visualization.
2492000	2496720	None of these are just outcomes of the straight logical path towards linear progress.
2496720	2502320	They're choices that are influenced by and subsequently influence politics. And like,
2502320	2506080	please don't reduce this to me saying that science is just a political tool.
2506080	2512480	Science can be used to many ends, and a lot of them are good, but, dare I say, some of them,
2512480	2517600	sometimes are bad. Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
2517600	2523120	And I'm not saying the way to avoid doing socially bad science is to remove the subjectivity.
2523120	2526720	Frankly, I don't think that's possible. I think the more productive takeaway is the
2526720	2532560	need for transparency and self-awareness in those choices so they can be as well-informed as possible.
2532560	2537760	In a 1996 paper titled, Is Science Socially Constructed? And Can It Still Inform Public
2537760	2543040	Policy? Scholar of Science and Technology Studies Sheila Jasenoff answers both questions with a
2543040	2548320	resounding and well-justified yes, emphasizing the importance of being aware of this multiplicity
2548320	2554000	of paths scientists can take. As one probes more deeply into the causes of policy-relevant
2554000	2560320	controversies, one finds that science's inability to answer questions is rarely the most pressing
2560320	2566000	problem. People are often convinced that they have the right scientific answer. Constructivist
2566000	2571600	analysis, which seeks even handedly to explain variations in beliefs about the world,
2571600	2577600	discovers in many such instances that disagreements about the right way to answer the quote-unquote
2577600	2583360	same question reflected deeper disagreements about what the disagreement really is.
2583360	2588240	So in order to get the maximum benefit of using science to inform any kind of public policy,
2588240	2595600	we have to be able to do the meta-analysis of which questions should we be asking to science.
2595600	2600080	And that is outside the purview of the scientific method. It's a skill set,
2600160	2604720	nuclear physicist Alvin Weinberg called trans-science. Understanding science
2604720	2610000	as social constructiveness is also really important in education. In the US, physics education,
2610000	2616720	especially at the earlier levels, frames learning science as collecting facts and tools that will
2616720	2622800	lead one to uncovering objective truths. What isn't often taught is the cognitive flexibility
2622800	2629120	required to make the judgment calls necessary to doing science. Remember Piercig? If he'd had a more
2629200	2634480	epistemologically mature understanding of what the point of science even is, he probably wouldn't
2634480	2638880	have had a crisis of faith that made him leave the field when he realized you can't be completely
2638880	2645520	rational about all of it all of the time. If your goal doing science is to find objective truth through
2645520	2651040	purely rational pathways, you're gonna get stuck the fuck up when you realize you can't find the
2651040	2656000	one true path. Or I guess you can convince yourself that you found it and then everybody around you
2656000	2660480	has to deal with your god complex. A complaint I hear all the time from research mentors and
2660480	2664560	advisors is that their students don't know how to take initiative over their work. Like they're
2664560	2669520	basically just obedient little robots who can do any analysis you instruct them to but really
2669520	2674240	struggle to come up with their own ideas. I think that struggle comes at least partially from
2674240	2680800	students' lack of belief in their own subjective reasoning skills and intuitive curiosity
2681280	2685520	because we never teach them how to make imperfect decisions. I don't think we even
2685520	2691280	tell them making imperfect decisions is okay, let alone necessary. For a more detailed discussion
2691280	2696080	on the gap between physics students learned perfectionism and the decidedly non-perfectionist
2696080	2700960	thinking necessary to do science, check out this article called Leaving the One True Path,
2700960	2706000	Teaching Physics Without Single Correct Answers, where MyLen DePenta talks about their experience
2706000	2711600	helping students unlearn rigid single solution thinking. Students often accepted the idea that
2711600	2716560	historical models were imperfect but assumed that the goal of science was to find the single
2716560	2722960	correct model. But there are no quote-unquote completely right answers. The finite number
2722960	2728960	of acceptable solutions all have their downsides so the skill of using them isn't in memorizing
2728960	2735520	or even deriving but in discerning which situations a model is well suited to. This helps students
2735520	2741680	reject objectivity without rejecting accountability. And it's not just future scientists who have to
2741680	2747120	have this knowledge flexibility. A lot of arguments against things like climate change or vaccine
2747120	2753440	efficacy stem from, well, the science changed so the science must be wrong. Maybe if we did a better
2753440	2758960	job of teaching people what science actually is and how we make it, they wouldn't be recreating
2758960	2763440	Pearson's very rational breakdown every time they're confronted with updated information.
2763440	2767680	Scientific literacy is a thing and it's more than just memorizing some fun facts or knowing
2767680	2772880	how to manipulate equations. And on that note, the social constructiveness of science plays a huge
2772880	2778000	part in determining what the public believes. An example of this I really like is the recent
2778000	2784000	scientific validation of millennia old practices in eastern medicine and spirituality like yoga
2784000	2788880	or acupuncture. Today there is peer-reviewed research proving the efficacy of these practices
2788880	2792560	to the point that they're sometimes prescribed by doctors or covered by insurance.
2792560	2796560	But while pointing scientific tools at these ancient methods didn't all of a sudden make
2796560	2802160	them work better, it did make it so that large swaths of the population who would have dismissed
2802160	2807840	them before as mystic bullshit would now take them seriously. They believe it because science said
2807840	2812640	it was true. Science made it true for them, even though it had already been true for a lot of people
2812640	2818240	for a long time. Similarly, at least to the extent that you probably have heard of dark matter and
2818240	2824720	you probably haven't heard of Monde, your scientific knowledge of gravity has been socially constructed.
2824720	2827840	Because while the physicists in my comment section are currently typing,
2827840	2833120	well duh, scientists know that we're dealing with imperfect models and gravity is obviously
2833120	2837440	incomplete. Who doesn't know that? The public doesn't always know that and they can only work
2837440	2843200	with what we give them. So via what I feel safe to assess is the common belief that dark matter
2843200	2849280	exists and gravity is just facts. Scientific knowledge is socially constructed. The way
2849280	2855440	scientists do the science has space for variation while still being science. But the reasons for
2855440	2860400	that variation are not because of the science, they're because of the science's context.
2860400	2866240	If you buy that whole German-French biology analysis, things like political climate and
2866240	2872160	social milieu can influence the direction scientists pursue the infinite hypotheses
2872160	2877840	available to them. And like I keep saying, the field of astrophysics has largely made a choice
2877840	2882000	when it comes to dark matter. The logical conclusion I'm coming to is that there must
2882000	2886720	be some contextual reason for us choosing dark matter, which begs the question...
2895520	2900800	Okay, so this is the highly speculative and squishy part of the video where I share
2901440	2907600	the broader trends that, at least in my mind, seem aligned with the hard lean towards explaining
2907600	2912800	the dark matter observations with space ether instead of more complicated gravity. I have
2912800	2918320	one pitch for a purely socio-political factor because that's what this video is about. But I
2918320	2922560	would be remiss if I didn't mention the institutional factors that are at play as well.
2922560	2928880	TLDR, academic publishing in the United States, is literally just a business that motivates researchers
2928880	2932560	to heavily invest in whatever is already being heavily invested in.
2932560	2937120	This isn't something specific to Mond and dark matter, by the way. This is just saying that
2937120	2942160	if there's some small difference in people's interest in the two theories, the financial
2942160	2948480	incentives of publishing would exacerbate and solidify that difference such that there is an
2948480	2953920	obvious choice of which one you should study if you want a job. The Matthew Effect, a principle
2954000	2958960	that says that a small advantage early on will snowball into a large advantage later on,
2958960	2964080	has been measured in all aspects of publishing from journal impact to institutional ranking
2964080	2970240	and even individual careers. And papers on novel research are actually biased against in journals
2970240	2976000	even though they're more likely to become a top 1% most cited paper in the long term.
2976000	2980800	Basically, financial incentives deter people from rocking the boat even though boat rocking is
2980800	2986000	fundamentally necessary to progress science. But that's enough publishing and bibliometrics talk.
2986000	2988960	If you want to hear more about it, go watch this other video that I made.
2988960	2993840	My point here is that if there's enough of a reason to push scientists towards one direction
2993840	2999760	even a little bit, then institutional incentives would solidify and exacerbate that choice.
2999760	3004240	But this still begs the question, why the initial push towards dark matter?
3004240	3009920	What were the post-big bang in homogeneities that led to the large-scale structure of the universe?
3009920	3014000	Is a metaphor useful if you need an upper division cosmology course to understand it?
3014000	3016560	I don't know, this joke's almost as obscure as the E41.
3016560	3018720	What am I doing? Okay, here's my pitch.
3018720	3024160	I think the collective subjective choice of choosing invisible stuff as an explanation
3024160	3029840	for dark matter is consistent with physics' cultural value of simplicity.
3029840	3034720	And if you don't think physics has a culture, congratulations, you're thinking like a physicist.
3034720	3041280	Because believing that physicists have no culture is a well-documented part of physics' culture.
3041280	3045760	But yeah, the physics community, at least in post-enlightenment western science,
3045760	3052880	highly values solutions that are beautiful or elegant, like some kind of horny Occam's razor
3052880	3057840	that prioritizes solutions so simple they require feminizing for some reason.
3057840	3061760	Occam's razor, by the way, also called the principle of parsimony sometimes,
3061760	3066640	is the idea that the solution that makes the fewest assumptions is usually the best solution.
3066640	3070000	But as much as Occam's razor can be a helpful rule of thumb that prevents
3070000	3073040	nerds like Piercig from having a complete mental breakdown,
3073040	3076480	there is no rule that the universe has to be straightforward.
3076480	3081120	A messy solution can in fact be more useful than a clean one, an elegant one.
3081120	3087280	A really great example of simplicity as a driving value for physics is the search for a theory of
3087280	3094800	everything. Hypothetically, a theory of knowledge would explain all aspects of the universe fully
3094800	3101920	in one neat set of equations. Or ideally, one equation. Historically, we have had success
3101920	3107760	with some kinds of unified theories. For example, Maxwell unified our theories of electricity and
3107760	3114080	magnetism into electromagnetism. But a unified theory of everything that combines the electromagnetic
3114080	3118400	force with the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force and even gravity?
3118400	3122080	That's our holy grail. And I'll grant we've come kind of close.
3122080	3126960	There are fairly solid models for a grand unified theory that explain all the forces except for
3126960	3131360	gravity. A whole bunch of famous theories exist to make gravity play nice with the other forces.
3131360	3135200	This is what string theory is trying to do, this is what m-theory is trying to do,
3135200	3140320	this is what loop quantum gravity is trying to do, but no one's quite gotten it to work.
3140320	3144800	Honestly, gravity's just really hard to pin down in general. Like we can predict what it does
3144800	3152800	in some context, but we have absolutely no idea why. So the search for theories of everything
3152800	3158240	is illustrative of modern physics' tendency towards simplification. And I think astronomy's
3158240	3163760	attempt to explain the dark matter observations with space ether instead of further revisions to
3163760	3169520	gravity is consistent with a broader desire to reduce everything to a few simple rules.
3169520	3173600	Because we like for things to be simple. No more than that, we expect them to be.
3173600	3180000	So we often study them as if they are. And I'm not trying to say this tendency is purely monkey
3180000	3184640	brain's vibes based. The principle of parsimony is useful in a lot of contexts, and there are
3184640	3189440	perfectly valid statistical and philosophical arguments for not rejecting it outright. And it
3189440	3195360	is objectively a cool thing when you can explain multiple different problems with a single solution.
3195360	3200000	And it's awesome that that is sometimes the solution that works best. But I don't think
3200000	3204880	it's unreasonable to say that the assumption of simplicity can affect what scientists choose to
3204880	3210720	study and how they choose to study it. Not necessarily in bad ways, but in ways that limit
3210720	3216000	the knowledge we generate. In a second here, I'm going to wax philosophical on why physicists want
3216000	3220400	everything to be simple. But first, I want to pose this video's discussion prompt for the comment
3220400	3224720	section. If you're new here, I've been ending my videos with a question for the viewer at home
3224720	3229200	to answer in the comments. And in the end of the next video, I'll share some of the answers I get
3229200	3234400	from this video, prioritizing commenters who also comment on other people's comments,
3234400	3240640	because that's how we make this a conversation. Today's question is, what are other examples
3240640	3246480	of cultural values influencing the creation of knowledge in whatever field, discipline,
3246480	3251840	or area of expertise you have experience in? What's a subjective principle you've seen
3251840	3257120	affect how people explain things or even what things people choose to explain? And it doesn't
3257120	3262560	have to be in academia, knowledge creation happens in lots of contexts and values are always involved.
3262560	3266080	I know my viewers always come through with super interesting answers, so I'm really excited to
3266080	3269840	see what we get with this one. So I hope you'll take a moment to share your unique perspective
3269840	3273600	with me and the rest of the audience and check out other people's perspectives too,
3273600	3278480	so you don't just have to trust mine. Did you do it? Great, thanks. So why do physicists want
3278480	3282560	everything to be simple? I think the most compelling reason I've heard for this actually
3282560	3286720	comes from an argument against grand unified theories, so it's a good thing that you already
3286720	3291040	know what those are. That astrophysicist Glycer that I mentioned earlier who wrote Island of
3291040	3295520	Knowledge also wrote a really interesting contribution to a book of essays called This Idea
3295520	3300720	Must Die, Scientific Theories That Are Blocking Progress, which is a super fun read by the way.
3300720	3305280	In his essay, he points out some of the shortcomings of existing unification theories,
3305280	3308720	argues that the idea is nice but ultimately kind of naive,
3308720	3313120	and proposes what he sees as an explanation for said naivete.
3313120	3319760	The scientific impulse to unify is crypto-religious. The West has bathed in monotheism for thousands
3319760	3325280	of years, and even in polytheistic cultures, there's always an Alpha God in charge. There's
3325280	3331280	something deeply appealing in equating all of nature to a single creative principle. To decipher
3331280	3335680	the mind of God is to be special, is to answer a higher calling.
3335680	3339360	Okay, I know there's going to be people who have been with me this whole time whose brains just like
3340000	3343840	shut off when they heard the word God. If it makes you feel better, Stephen Hawking,
3343840	3348720	who was a very rational guy whose biopic was literally titled The Theory of Everything,
3348720	3354560	initially believed in such theories but eventually abandoned it as well. But back to the God stuff.
3354560	3358960	Despite the common belief that science and religion are opposite things that don't have
3358960	3362960	anything to do with each other, there is a strong historical record that indicates that
3362960	3367520	Enlightenment science was influenced by the cultural dominance of the church in Europe,
3367520	3373200	and a particular puritanism that was the predecessor for modern physics' weird secular
3373200	3379040	asceticism in the name of a god of rationality. Again, this one point will probably be a whole
3379040	3384000	hour long video eventually. But for now, let's just say that the intermingling of science and
3384000	3389280	religious thought, including western science and Christianity, is a well-documented part of
3389280	3394080	its history. And I'm not trying to overstate the chain of causality here because social evolution
3394080	3399840	is not so easily reducible. But the Abrahamic holdover of a single point of origin for all
3399840	3406720	things just makes a lot of sense to me as the reason physicists tend towards a simple solution
3406720	3412800	even in the face of a messy reality. It really feels like this desire to reduce the universe
3412800	3419360	to a base set of equations is just repackaged monism with some scientific flavor. We want to
3419360	3424240	make physics simple because deep down we know that we're all one, man. Damn, is that really
3424240	3428400	where this video is landing? We made up dark matter because scientists want to believe in God,
3428400	3430240	I guess so. Told you we'd get there.
3437520	3442160	What a journey this has been. Unless this video convinced anyone that I'm not a serious
3442240	3446640	scientist, I should clarify I'm not some diehard Mont supporter who thinks that dark matter
3446640	3451920	definitely can't exist. I'm more just trying to make a point that sometimes scientists pedestal
3451920	3456720	certain theories because of subjective values. I don't know what's definitely true, I'm just
3456720	3461920	trying to see what I can glean from the situation by keeping an open mind. And like, who knows,
3461920	3466320	maybe they're both right. If the biggest problem with either solution is that neither can explain
3466320	3471840	all of the dark matter observations, then maybe there's some combo solution in which both things
3471840	3477280	are contributing to what we see. Real talk, though, it barely matters which of these theories is right
3477280	3483440	because it's astrophysics. The stakes are literally just ego. The thing that matters is that if we
3483440	3489040	don't pay attention to how we construct scientific knowledge, we might not realize the effects it
3489040	3495360	could have on people. And when it comes to actually materially useful fields like medicine or engineering
3495360	3502240	or computer science or psychology, those impacts can do as much to harm as they can do to help.
3502240	3507280	And as much as I am deeply a proponent of science for the sake of science, knowledge for the sake
3507280	3512880	of knowledge, and don't need every question we attempt to answer to immediately have a tangible
3512880	3520000	use for humanity, I also think that we should maybe kind of actively try not to make knowledge that
3520000	3525120	is harmful. Maybe. And it's hard to do that if you can't even admit you're making it.
3525120	3530320	So yeah, our scientific understanding of gravity is socially constructed, and we are almost certainly
3530320	3535280	wrong about it in the exact same way that people at any point in the past have been wrong about it.
3535280	3541520	And yet, we've accomplished incredible things with it, like landing people on the moon or sending
3541520	3547280	a soundtrack of humanity to the furthest reaches of the solar system. Like, Einstein predicted
3547280	3552560	gravitational waves 100 years ago, and in the last decade, we started measuring them accurately
3552560	3557920	enough to detect when two black holes smash into each other in another galaxy. That is nothing
3557920	3565040	short of amazing. I am amazed. Amazed. But as amazing as it is, we did still make that knowledge
3565040	3570480	up, and we will continue to make knowledge up, and it will continue to be cool and useful and
3570480	3575840	interesting. Social constructivism doesn't negate science or say that nothing is real or that
3575840	3581120	everything is relative. It makes our understanding more complete by giving us a lens to analyze
3581120	3587280	why we do what we do and why we think what we think. To deny the inherently subjective
3587280	3593920	humanness in the endeavor of doing physics is to deny what pushed us to do it in the first place.
3593920	3600880	Not ego or money or even utility, but curiosity. That spark that only comes when you realize that
3600880	3605440	you don't know something and that there might be more to the world than you thought before.
3605440	3611680	That drive to describe the ineffable that we attempt to satisfy through art and religion and
3611680	3617040	yeah, even science. When you hear an astronomer wax poetic about the beauty of the cosmos,
3617040	3622240	that's not rationality, that's mythology. And a thousand years from now, when future humans look
3622240	3626800	back at whatever remaining record there is about dark matter from today, and they're inevitably
3626800	3632320	mixing up our science with our pop culture, and they go, look at those humans from way back in
3632320	3636560	the day that invented this invisible stuff because they didn't understand this super
3636560	3642720	simple thing about gravity that even kids know today. It'll be fine because gravity is a social
3642720	3652000	construct and that's okay. Hey everyone, welcome to the end of the video. Thank you so much for
3652000	3657680	making it here. I had a lot of fun with this video. It might honestly be my favorite one so far
3657680	3662960	and I appreciate you watching it all the way to the end. In a second, I'm going to share some viewer
3662960	3668320	comments from my last video, which was about the tech industry and the TV show succession,
3668320	3673760	but first I gotta pay my bills. I already mentioned my Patreon and you probably know what Patreon is,
3673760	3677920	but just in case you don't, it's a website where you can sign up to give creators like me
3677920	3683040	a couple dollars a month in exchange for things like exclusive access to secret content,
3683040	3690080	having your names immortalized in my videos, and that tiny thing of helping me have an income.
3690080	3695600	Like I said before, I really, really, really, really appreciate everybody who signed up already.
3695600	3699520	I really encourage you to think about it if you're able to and if you're not, like, don't
3699520	3704240	worry about it. Otherwise, you can do the free things to support me, like liking the video,
3704240	3708640	sharing it with a friend, leaving a comment, subscribing to the channel. I know they all
3708640	3713520	seem kind of silly and small, but ultimately they make the numbers go up and that is what
3713520	3718240	determines how much I get paid. So enough of that, let's get into the succession comments.
3718240	3725440	So for context, this last video was where I used the very popular HBO show succession
3726160	3733760	to examine how some decisions are made re-regulation of the tech industry. Basically,
3733760	3740160	the gist is that the tech industry can be quite harmful and regulation is often seen as the way
3740160	3746880	to prevent that harm and regulation can do some things to prevent harm, but it has limitations
3746880	3753200	because of the fact that it's a top-down solution and therefore is ultimately controlled by people
3753200	3759840	with power. And my conclusion was that regulation's fine, but we should try to consider a multiplicity
3759840	3764720	of solutions for the problems we face with the tech industry. And so I asked people to share
3765360	3770960	what might be some of those solutions, particularly, like, what might be solutions that people can
3770960	3776160	engage in, not, like, what should the government do to fix everything. So before I share the kinds
3776160	3782160	of solutions that people suggested, I want to share one comment that I think is a really good framing
3782160	3788880	for the whole question of the role of, like, tech and software in, like, liberation projects.
3788880	3794160	So this is from Kevin Hengehold, who I actually know through the Patreon. I got really excited
3794160	3798640	learning about data and big tech during lockdown because I saw all the hype around Cambridge
3798640	3803920	Analytica and thought, fire with fire, right? But to build large-scale left-wing projects to
3803920	3809360	fight for workers' rights, housing rights, decommodified existence, etc., we need to develop
3809360	3815360	strong relationships that you can't get by A-B testing email subject lines. All that's to say,
3815360	3820640	I think it's better to find the people fighting a good cause and use tech to support it rather than
3820640	3826480	saying how can tech solve x, which I think puts the cart before the horse. I think he completely
3826480	3831840	hit the nail on the head with that comment. Like, I see a lot of really well-intentioned people with
3831840	3836720	a lot of very technical expertise try to, like, hold up their technical expertise as the solution
3836720	3843440	to whatever problem is ailing society, and it's not that their expertise has no place in a solution,
3843440	3850560	but it is not enough on its own. And I think what Kevin pointed out as, like,
3850560	3855680	you can't fight fire with fire when you're trying to do something more meaningful than burn
3855680	3862240	everything down. Becoming the socialist software developer or whatever it was from the last video
3862240	3868000	requires more than just imitating the enemy. The master's tools will not dismantle the master's house
3868640	3875840	but for algorithms. Now I've got three lifeboats or three solutions that a lot of people seem to
3875840	3881840	converge on. The first is open-source software, which is when software is made free and publicly
3881840	3888160	available along with the code that created it so people can use it and modify it and build upon
3888160	3894480	it freely. Nick Albritton3796 says, I think it's important to kickstart and develop new open-source
3894480	3899760	software technologies and to hopefully start building that same concept into hardware technologies,
3899760	3904400	removing the profit drive and leaving only the incentive of why people develop and use that
3904400	3908400	tech in the first place. And a lot of people said something very similar and I agree. But I
3908400	3913120	think something that was really interesting to see was not exactly the criticisms people had of
3913120	3919360	open-source, but kind of the caveats that should be kept in mind when trying to implement open-source
3919360	3925600	projects that seem really important. For example, respectable user name says, definitely agree on
3925600	3930640	the promoting open-source, but also putting in place mechanisms to support people working on
3930640	3935920	open-source as so often these folks are effectively working for all these big tech companies literally
3935920	3940800	for free. And there was another interesting critique I saw from Mary Reverie who says,
3940800	3946880	open-source software is not without fault either. It is the transparent aspect of website text that
3946880	3953440	allowed for proprietary LLMs like GPT to be created. There is no free lunch, brunch, or dinner.
3953440	3958000	Everyone has to think critically before putting stuff out. So yeah, open-source can be super
3958000	3963040	helpful in making more resources accessible to more people, but it does have the shortcoming that
3963040	3969120	big tech companies can take advantage of it just as easily as you or I. So the second lifeboat that
3969120	3973280	people converged on was education. And I know I talked about education in the video, but I was
3973280	3977520	mostly talking about college level education. There were actually a lot of people talking about
3977520	3984080	like K through 12 level education. So for example, Matias Lopez 6144 says, as a high school teacher
3984080	3988240	in Argentina, I have numerous students with different interests and political standpoints.
3988240	3993200	Many of them want to be programmers and are excited about AI and untrusting of international
3993200	3998320	corporations. One lifeboat is to foster community building in high schools, opening the debate and
3998320	4003600	showing other ways to live and to understand both society and technology. Treating our students
4003600	4008080	with respect and engaging with their interests in a matter that fosters their passion, empathy,
4008080	4012800	and love for their future profession and for the rest of humanity has the potential for helping in
4012800	4017920	the change. Something I really appreciate about your comment Matias was that you mentioned empathy
4017920	4026720	and based in the work I've done in like college level education for engineering ethics is that
4026800	4031040	it's really hard to imagine people who are learning engineering and computer science and all
4031040	4037280	these things go on being empathetic in their careers and in the things they create when they
4037280	4042160	weren't necessarily treated very empathetically as they were learning how to do those things.
4042160	4046480	And I feel like a lot of people might think it's weird to be like, we need to make engineers more
4046480	4051840	empathetic, but I kind of do think that's very important. And there were quite some other comments
4051840	4057280	from educators talking about engaging their students like this. John Hendricks 3253 says that
4057280	4062640	since 2016 they've taught a mini unit on media literacy where students learn strategies to
4062640	4068080	navigate and dismiss fake news, which is a really cool way to try to combat a specific harm of tech.
4068080	4073760	And there was even one high school student who talked about trying to engage their classmates
4073760	4078400	in conversations about tech and ethics and all this stuff. Misery of Micah says,
4078400	4082960	it seems really small, but being a high school student, soon to be college student,
4082960	4087600	I feel starting direct conversations with teachers and classmates about the role of technology in
4087600	4093120	our world would be a first step to decreasing anti-techno capitalist sentiment in this education
4093120	4097840	institution. I love that. And the last lifeboat I saw again and again was community engagement,
4097840	4102160	which made me very excited because I made a whole video about why that's so important for
4102720	4110320	doing any kind of politics. But I also saw someone talk about how community engagement
4110320	4117520	can kind of fill the personal hole that so many of us have that we try to fill with social media
4117520	4123200	and stuff like that. Burn Blue Fire K says, I think on the most individual level, what people need
4123200	4127840	is a sense of fulfillment or entertainment outside of what tech provides. Most people's
4127840	4133120	everyday use of tech or understanding of it just as a vehicle for content and or convenience.
4133120	4137760	Addictive but hollow on both the creator and the audience side. Learn to love something
4137760	4143520	about the place you're in. It helps to naturally form an investment in seeing it thrive. Have that
4143520	4147840	be in people's focus rather than all the things we see online that are functionally intangible
4147840	4152240	and feel impossible to do anything about. These interests will naturally lead to connections
4152560	4159040	Point is, there are so many different ways that so many different people can participate in a
4159040	4164880	resistance against whatever kind of oppressive force, be it big tech or anything else. And it's
4164880	4168560	so much fun to see the different ideas people come up with. Thank you so much for everybody who
4168560	4175120	left a comment. I don't know how to end this. I kind of want to just like end on something
4175120	4180000	like controversial. Exoplanet research is a sham.
