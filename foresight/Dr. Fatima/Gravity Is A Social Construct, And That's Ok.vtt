00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
In the philosophy of science, constructivism is the perspective that, while reality may exist

00:05.680 --> 00:11.360
independent of our silly little human brains, scientific knowledge is socially constructed.

00:11.360 --> 00:14.720
But definitions are boring. Vibes are far more important.

00:14.720 --> 00:18.960
How do scientists feel about this idea? Let's examine the data.

00:18.960 --> 00:24.720
A perverse doctrine that subordinates rationality to politics and unbridled subjectivity.

00:24.720 --> 00:30.240
An indefensible reduction of all claims about nature to equally contingent status.

00:30.240 --> 00:35.680
A conspiracy of leftist humanists and social scientists against both science and western

00:35.680 --> 00:41.200
civilization. Fascinating. I'm going to go ahead and say that most scientists, you know,

00:41.200 --> 00:45.200
I could be wrong about this, but it's the impression I get from years in the field,

00:45.200 --> 00:50.000
extensive study on the culture of science and, you know, being a person online.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.240
Most scientists don't find constructivism that helpful an idea. But lucky for you, I'm not

00:56.240 --> 01:00.720
most scientists. My doctoral research was in astrophysics, but more recently I've been

01:00.720 --> 01:06.240
publishing papers and making videos about the more social and political aspects of science.

01:06.240 --> 01:10.080
And the whole point that I'm trying to get across is that even the hardest of the hard

01:10.080 --> 01:15.600
sciences are still affected by messy people stuff. And I get the impression that some people are

01:15.600 --> 01:19.600
kind of starting to come around to that idea, especially in fields like medicine or maybe

01:19.600 --> 01:27.280
even technology, but not physics, right? Physics is just the fundamental truth about the universe.

01:27.280 --> 01:32.640
Particles don't care about the political climate. Radiation doesn't discriminate against women.

01:32.640 --> 01:40.080
Gravity isn't a social construct, right? In this video, I'm going to use gravity,

01:40.080 --> 01:45.760
dark matter and a controversial, but in my opinion, compelling theory to illustrate why even the most

01:45.760 --> 01:52.880
objective, rational, definitely not made up facts about the universe are indeed socially constructed.

01:52.880 --> 01:56.640
And don't worry, I'm going to explain what that even means. But it's going to be a lighthearted

01:56.640 --> 02:00.720
and fun video today. I promise this isn't going to end up being about racism or something heavy

02:00.800 --> 02:06.320
like that about God, maybe, but not in the way you think. Just watch it. Trust me, it's going to be a good one.

02:06.320 --> 02:31.840
Before we get into it, I want to lay out a few working definitions because I feel like a lot of

02:31.840 --> 02:36.080
conversations about squishy human subjects like this tend to get stuck on semantics.

02:36.160 --> 02:40.880
And social constructivism is definitely the kind of term that means different things in different

02:40.880 --> 02:45.360
contexts. So if you're mostly here for the physics, bear with me for just a little while I talk about

02:46.320 --> 02:53.120
sociology. Social constructivism is broadly the idea that the natural world just kind of exists,

02:53.120 --> 02:58.480
and then scientific knowledge is what we create in our attempt to model the natural world,

02:58.480 --> 03:04.560
but it is not the same as transcendent truth about the natural world. In other words,

03:04.560 --> 03:09.200
knowledge is something we construct. One way to build a stronger intuition for what this means

03:09.200 --> 03:15.440
is to consider the opposite philosophy, objectivism. Not that weird like A&Rand objectivism where

03:15.440 --> 03:20.720
productivity is man's most noble calling or whatever. The scientific objectivist belief

03:20.720 --> 03:24.880
that us mere mortals can in fact deduce fundamental truths about the universe

03:24.880 --> 03:29.840
transcendent of approximations or models. But like many things in the social sciences,

03:29.840 --> 03:34.800
these philosophies exist on a spectrum. On one end of the spectrum we have objectivism,

03:34.800 --> 03:40.640
and on the other end strong constructivism. The two genders. Strong constructivism is where an

03:40.640 --> 03:46.080
objective observer independent reality just doesn't exist. Or at least that us humans are

03:46.080 --> 03:52.160
indelibly incapable of accessing it so it might as well not exist. Closer to the objectivist end,

03:52.160 --> 03:58.640
we can consider a weak constructivism that proposes the goals of science at any given time can be

03:58.640 --> 04:03.760
reflective of the surrounding culture or the vague claim that individual scientists work will

04:03.760 --> 04:08.320
tend to follow the money. But somewhere between the weak and strong versions we have a whole lot

04:08.320 --> 04:13.760
of epistemological question marks that constructivist analyses aim to answer. When does an experiment

04:13.760 --> 04:18.480
sufficiently capture a natural phenomenon? What happens when theories conflict with each other?

04:18.480 --> 04:24.560
How are unexpected outlying data points interpreted? And critically, how are any of these things

04:24.560 --> 04:29.200
influenced by the people who are doing them? I've talked in videos before about the strong

04:29.200 --> 04:34.160
constructivist end and the weak constructivist end, so today I'm concerning myself with this middle

04:34.160 --> 04:39.920
area that's less about the nature of reality or the influence of politics and more about the choices

04:39.920 --> 04:45.520
made in the process of conducting scientific research. In Act 1 we'll look at the science.

04:45.520 --> 04:50.320
We'll go through a brief history of gravity, do a little primer on dark matter, and introduce a

04:50.320 --> 04:55.120
theory that is attempting to challenge it. In Act 2 we'll get to more of the social side.

04:55.120 --> 04:58.800
We'll learn how the scientific method is actually kind of messy,

04:58.800 --> 05:03.120
get into how this messiness opens up space for subjective interpretations,

05:03.120 --> 05:07.600
and look at what kinds of things can influence those interpretations.

05:07.600 --> 05:12.880
We're going straight philosophy of physics today, and I for one am very excited.

05:23.440 --> 05:28.160
Everyone ever has known that gravity exists. I want to like drop something as a demonstration,

05:28.160 --> 05:30.000
but I don't actually have anything I want to drop.

05:31.760 --> 05:36.080
Gravity. Even animals know what gravity is, at least to the extent that their behavior is

05:36.080 --> 05:40.320
obviously informed by its existence. Like have you ever seen a cat do a really precise

05:40.320 --> 05:44.800
jump over something? You can't tell me that that cat doesn't understand what parabolic

05:44.800 --> 05:49.200
motion is just as well as any intro physics college student. Maybe not in equations or

05:49.200 --> 05:54.720
words, but as an experience for sure. Arguably the only beings to ever not intuitively understand

05:54.720 --> 05:59.040
that gravity exists are astronauts who just got back to earth and haven't yet remembered that

05:59.040 --> 06:03.040
they can't just put things down in midair. Now you know you've got the space station right up there

06:03.280 --> 06:09.120
that- I start with this comically basic understanding of what gravity is because

06:09.120 --> 06:13.520
some people will inevitably try to counter the whole social construct thing with this level

06:13.520 --> 06:18.320
of arguments. About it just being so obviously real and clearly not made up. So I bring up these

06:18.320 --> 06:23.040
silly examples to illustrate the difference between some inarguably self-evident shared

06:23.040 --> 06:28.720
experience and specific scientific descriptions of something, which is the part that I'm arguing

06:28.720 --> 06:33.920
is socially constructed. Me, you, and the cat can all agree that there is definitely some

06:34.480 --> 06:40.800
fundamentally real thing that makes some things fall into other things, but that is different

06:40.800 --> 06:45.200
than a scientific theory and it precedes any attempt to characterize it. The earliest written

06:45.200 --> 06:49.520
descriptions of gravity come from Greece and the Indian subcontinent and don't get much more advanced

06:49.520 --> 06:54.720
than vague notions of things tend to fall down towards the earth instead of up towards the sky.

06:54.720 --> 06:59.760
Neat. Eventually people started using numbers to describe this tendency more precisely and came

06:59.760 --> 07:05.120
to the conclusion that things fall down towards the earth at an acceleration of about 9.8 meters

07:05.120 --> 07:09.040
per second squared. The first mathematical formulation of gravity is often attributed

07:09.040 --> 07:14.880
to Gal Leo in the 17th century, but his work was built on 11th century polymath Ibn Sina's work on

07:14.880 --> 07:20.000
projectile motion, as well as 12th century polymath Abul Barakat al-Bardadi's relations between

07:20.000 --> 07:24.480
acceleration and force. Really bummed that I missed the era of interdisciplinary Middle Eastern

07:24.480 --> 07:30.160
scientists or artist scientists like Da Vinci actually helped this whole gravity progression

07:30.160 --> 07:36.000
along in between painting seminal masterpieces. Da Vinci? Today's physicists can never. So with

07:36.000 --> 07:41.600
this first quantitative description of gravity, we went from being able to predict that if you drop

07:41.600 --> 07:47.360
something it will hit the ground to if you drop something this is how long it will take to hit

07:47.360 --> 07:53.680
the ground. We did it. We made science. However, as mathematically rigorous as this description was,

07:53.680 --> 07:59.680
it had limitations. The acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 ish meters per second squared that we use

07:59.680 --> 08:05.600
in an intro physics class actually varies depending on latitude. Someone in Ecuador for example would

08:05.600 --> 08:09.920
measure a slightly different gravitational acceleration than someone in Sweden and both of

08:09.920 --> 08:14.720
them would measure something completely different than someone on say the surface of Mars. So while

08:14.720 --> 08:21.040
this formulation of gravity was true enough to like hit a rival ship with a cannonball or something,

08:21.040 --> 08:26.480
it was by no means internationally true, let alone universally true. We didn't get that until a guy

08:26.480 --> 08:32.000
named Isaac iterated on the work of Galileo and another guy who thought therefore he was and came

08:32.000 --> 08:37.760
up with what we now refer to as Newton's law of universal gravitation. Universal because this

08:37.760 --> 08:42.880
description wasn't specific to gravity on the surface of the earth. Newton's formulation described

08:42.880 --> 08:48.400
the gravitational force between any two bodies with mass, you and the earth, the earth and the sun,

08:48.400 --> 08:53.280
Jupiter and the Galilean moons, whatever. Any two objects with mass will experience a

08:53.280 --> 08:59.120
gravitational attraction between them that increases with either objects mass and decreases

08:59.120 --> 09:04.160
with the distance separating them. Boom, we figured it out, but for real this time. We've cracked the

09:04.160 --> 09:09.680
code to predict not only the motion of objects here on earth, but the orbits of the celestial bodies

09:09.680 --> 09:14.960
and theoretically anything else in the universe with mass. We're definitely right this time.

09:14.960 --> 09:19.280
But again, while more broadly useful than the previous Galilean formulation,

09:19.920 --> 09:25.920
Newton's law of universal gravitation wasn't quite as universal as he thought. For example,

09:25.920 --> 09:31.680
in the 1800s astronomers had measured the orbit of the planet Mercury so precisely that they found

09:31.680 --> 09:37.040
it to be inconsistent with what Newton's law of universal gravitation would predict. So they figured

09:37.040 --> 09:43.120
that there has to be another planet in closer to the sun. Spoiler alert, there was no such planet.

09:43.120 --> 09:47.680
It wasn't until Albert Einstein developed his theories of relativity at the start of the 20th

09:47.680 --> 09:53.200
century that Mercury's weird orbit could be explained. The TLDR of relativity is that the

09:53.200 --> 10:00.160
rates at which time passes can be altered by extremely high speeds or strong gravity. Time is

10:00.160 --> 10:06.320
relative, so everything else is too. Relativity is trippy and weird and too complicated to explain

10:06.320 --> 10:11.600
here, but the important thing that you need to know for our purposes is that we were able to make

10:11.600 --> 10:16.880
even more precise predictions about gravity with it. And many experiments have supported

10:16.880 --> 10:21.120
Einstein's theories of relativity. From Eddington's observations of gravitational

10:21.120 --> 10:26.320
lensing during a solar eclipse in 1919 to measurements of stellar orbits around the

10:26.320 --> 10:31.360
supermassive black hole SAJ star in the middle of our galaxy made just a few years ago. So we're

10:31.360 --> 10:37.440
definitely right this time. As powerful as this set of theories is, even it has shortcomings.

10:37.440 --> 10:42.480
Most famously, the relativistic construction of gravity is incompatible with quantum mechanics,

10:42.480 --> 10:47.360
which is arguably the other most successful set of theories to come out of the last century of

10:47.360 --> 10:53.440
physics. Both of these paradigms make extremely robust predictions in their own regimes. Relativity

10:53.440 --> 10:59.200
describing interactions between the most massive objects like stars and black holes and quantum

10:59.200 --> 11:04.720
mechanics describing interactions between the smallest things like particles and light waves.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.960
But they break down if you try to consider them together because they each make different assumptions

11:08.960 --> 11:13.760
about the underlying nature of reality. In quantum mechanics, causality is statistical,

11:13.760 --> 11:19.040
almost random seeming. The rate of time passage is static, and the universe has some baseline

11:19.040 --> 11:24.240
resolution, as if it's made out of really tiny pixels. For relativity to work, however, causality

11:24.240 --> 11:30.000
is necessarily deterministic. One cause can yield only one effect. Time is relative, like we said

11:30.000 --> 11:36.160
before, and the universe is continuous. There isn't some minimum size or mass that things can be.

11:36.160 --> 11:40.320
This is a great opportunity to point out the problem with thinking of scientific knowledge as

11:40.320 --> 11:45.680
either right or wrong. A naive, if not kind of understandable, reaction to these conflicting

11:45.680 --> 11:50.640
theories might be to say, well, if they contradict, one of them must be wrong. But the reality is that

11:50.640 --> 11:56.800
they both work. They both have predictive power. But each one has a particular context in which

11:56.800 --> 12:02.160
its predictive power is reliable. In fact, it doesn't really make sense to call earlier theories of

12:02.160 --> 12:07.920
gravity wrong either. Newtonian gravity works for certain contexts. Galilean gravity works for

12:07.920 --> 12:12.320
certain contexts. Hell, even the ancient Greek models that were barely more sophisticated than a

12:12.320 --> 12:17.760
cat's understanding of gravity works in certain contexts. I mean, the cat got over the thing,

12:17.760 --> 12:22.240
didn't it? Sometimes the cat knowledge is enough. Each model accounts for the knowledge that was

12:22.240 --> 12:28.800
available at the time and was iterated on as our new discoveries and ideas illuminated our ignorance.

12:28.800 --> 12:32.960
And it's easy to look at this history of gravity and feel like we're coming closer and closer to

12:32.960 --> 12:38.400
the truth. But in reality, it only seems like that in hindsight. When you learn a lineage of

12:38.400 --> 12:43.440
increasingly successful theories in a physics class or science documentary, you generally don't learn

12:43.440 --> 12:48.400
about the false darts and failed ideas that were necessary to get us to where we are today.

12:48.400 --> 12:53.440
So to complicate matters a bit, we're going to shift gears into a modern problem in astrophysics

12:53.440 --> 12:57.680
that continues to illuminate our ignorance about gravity, dark matter.

13:04.880 --> 13:09.120
So I'm going to go ahead and hazard a guess that most of you have heard of dark matter before and

13:09.120 --> 13:14.160
are at least vaguely aware of it as something that probably exists. As another astrophysical lady

13:14.160 --> 13:18.320
YouTuber who I get compared to a whole lot has explained in a recent video of hers,

13:18.320 --> 13:23.440
dark matter is not a theory, it is an observation. For our purposes today, I'm only going to explain

13:23.440 --> 13:28.560
one of these observations as a mental foothold for my broader argument, but I will refer to some of

13:28.560 --> 13:33.520
these other observations a little in passing. So if you want a more solid baseline explanation of the

13:33.520 --> 13:38.400
full set of observations, go check out her video, if for no other reason than to hear the dark matter

13:39.040 --> 13:44.720
dark matter. Do we need it? What is it? Where is it? How much iconic? So what is this observation

13:44.720 --> 13:49.920
that we call dark matter? The graph I'm going to use to explain this is called a rotation curve,

13:49.920 --> 13:54.800
and it shows how the speed objects in orbit around something changes as they get farther

13:54.800 --> 14:00.080
away from that thing. So if we were to make a rotation curve of the solar system, for example,

14:00.080 --> 14:05.600
this axis would be each planet's distance from the sun and each point's height would tell us how

14:05.600 --> 14:11.360
fast the planet is orbiting. And we have a trend. The further the planet is, the slower it orbits,

14:11.360 --> 14:16.320
because the force due to gravity, which is what's driving the orbit, gets weaker with distance.

14:16.320 --> 14:21.280
But it's slightly more complicated than that. The mass that gravitationally drives the orbital

14:21.280 --> 14:26.960
speed isn't just the thing in the center, it's everything inside the orbit. But because the sun

14:26.960 --> 14:33.040
is so much more massive than even all the planets put together, the difference in mass inside Mercury's

14:33.040 --> 14:38.720
orbit and the mass inside Pluto's orbit isn't that important. So the variation we see in this

14:38.720 --> 14:43.760
rotation curve is mostly just because of the changing distance. If we were to make the same

14:43.760 --> 14:48.880
graph for a galaxy rather than a solar system, we would expect the curve to look a little bit

14:48.880 --> 14:53.520
different. Because the mass isn't as concentrated in the center, the further you get, the more

14:53.520 --> 14:58.400
stuff you're orbiting, so instead of the graph dropping off quickly, it holds up for a while.

14:58.400 --> 15:02.720
But once you get to the edge of the galaxy where there's not that much more stuff being added,

15:02.720 --> 15:07.440
the graph should begin to drop. Or at least that's what we would have expected. Turns out,

15:07.440 --> 15:11.840
when we measure the speeds of the furthest out orbiting stars and gas in galaxies,

15:11.840 --> 15:16.240
they're going much faster than we'd expect, as if there was a lot more stuff inside those

15:16.240 --> 15:22.000
far out orbits than we can see. And that difference between the rotation curve we'd predict based on

15:22.000 --> 15:27.600
the mass of the matter we can see in the galaxy, and the actual rotation curve we get when we measure

15:27.600 --> 15:36.960
how fast things are moving, is what we call dark matter. The term dark matter is simply a label

15:36.960 --> 15:42.160
for a particular way in which our understanding of the universe is wrong. It is exactly this

15:42.160 --> 15:48.640
wrong, and that wrongness is what dark matter is. It's not a theory, it's a set of observations,

15:48.640 --> 15:53.040
and this is one of them. Now everything I've said so far is just kind of categorically true.

15:53.040 --> 15:57.840
This is the prediction that our currently accepted models of gravity expect, and this

15:57.840 --> 16:02.640
is the measurement we see when we try to test those models. Neither of these things is really up for

16:02.640 --> 16:05.920
debate. I mean, I could probably make it up for debate, but I won't. But even though what I'm

16:05.920 --> 16:10.880
about to say next could be found in any intro astronomy textbook, I want to mark this point

16:10.880 --> 16:17.280
as the end of me sharing facts about dark matter, and the beginning of me sharing theories about

16:17.280 --> 16:20.960
dark matter. There's a difference, and it will make more sense as we go. Would it be a mixing

16:20.960 --> 16:24.640
metaphor as if I said we're now crossing the event horizon? Whatever, I'm a physicist,

16:24.640 --> 16:29.440
not a poet. So the prevailing explanation for why these two curves look different is because

16:29.440 --> 16:34.400
there's some invisible stuff in galaxies. And if this were to be the case, there are two things

16:34.400 --> 16:39.440
we could confidently say about it. First, that it doesn't interact electromagnetically. It doesn't

16:39.440 --> 16:44.880
emit light, or absorb light, or reflect light, and is therefore completely undetectable in images

16:44.880 --> 16:49.520
that rely on light coming from an object. Or according to some theories, it doesn't interact

16:49.520 --> 16:56.640
electromagnetically much. Hence, dark. And second, it does interact gravitationally. Because it's

16:56.640 --> 17:02.800
causing these gravitational effects on orbits, it must have mass, which means it must be some kind

17:02.800 --> 17:10.800
of matter. Thus, dark matter. Stuff with mass that we cannot see. Hard to see stuff. And that's a fine

17:10.800 --> 17:16.160
idea. But there's kind of a big hole in it, and that's that we don't have any real idea of what

17:16.160 --> 17:21.840
it actually is. There are a ton of different models for what dark matter is, but none of them explain

17:21.840 --> 17:27.680
the observations completely. Some theories model dark matter as a kind of particle, like axions,

17:27.680 --> 17:34.160
or gravatinos, or what somebody very cleverly named, weakly interacting massive particles.

17:34.160 --> 17:39.280
Feels like projection. Presumably playing off that pun, somebody proposed a theory for dark matter

17:39.280 --> 17:44.800
in which it was made of large, dark objects like black holes or brown dwarfs. Instead of a fluid

17:44.880 --> 17:51.360
of particles naming them massive, compact, halo objects. So at one point, the competing theories

17:51.360 --> 17:56.720
for dark matter were wimps and machos. This is an astronomer's idea of a good joke, by the way.

17:56.720 --> 18:01.600
This is astronomy culture. And it's not like a nickname or something. The title of the paper

18:01.600 --> 18:06.800
I published once has the word macho in it twice because of the name of the events I'm analyzing.

18:06.800 --> 18:11.280
I was looking for black holes and the data I used to identify them came from the macho project,

18:11.280 --> 18:15.680
because black holes could maybe be a kind of macho. So the maybe black holes from my thesis

18:15.680 --> 18:20.240
are named things like macho 96 bulge 5. I always had more hope in that one. I was never convinced

18:20.240 --> 18:26.000
by macho 98 bulge 6. At 100,000 subscribers, I'll do a video about my old astrophysics research.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.440
So if you want to hear more about this overdone tangent, smash that subscribe button. I hate myself

18:31.440 --> 18:35.600
when I do this sometimes. Sorry, the pun thing really got me going. So some people think dark

18:35.600 --> 18:40.560
matter is an invisible particle. Some people think it's big dark things. Some people think it's a

18:40.560 --> 18:45.600
fifth dimension that somehow makes everything make sense. There are theories of cold dark matter

18:45.600 --> 18:51.040
and hot dark matter and even warm dark matter. My personal favorite theory is that of primordial

18:51.040 --> 18:55.840
black holes, which are like teeny tiny little black holes that formed right after the Big Bang,

18:55.840 --> 19:00.960
because I think it's cute. The Uwu theory of dark matter, if you will. This must be what Contra

19:00.960 --> 19:04.800
points felt like when she said Squidwardian. Are we really saying that's word out loud? To an

19:04.800 --> 19:09.760
audience of millions? Okay. But here's the problem. None of these theories of dark matter on their

19:09.760 --> 19:14.800
own can explain all our observations. Like I said earlier, there are other kinds of observations

19:14.800 --> 19:19.680
besides the rotation curves of galaxies that point to some undetectable mass of an unknown

19:19.680 --> 19:25.040
nature. And different models of what dark matter actually is are better able to explain the different

19:25.040 --> 19:30.960
observations. This vulcanization of theories is not dissimilar from the story of luminiferous ether,

19:30.960 --> 19:36.000
which 19th century physicists used to explain how light traveled through empty space. Just like

19:36.000 --> 19:41.040
with dark matter, some effectively invisible material was predicted in order to explain

19:41.040 --> 19:45.920
unexpected experimental results. And the models fractured further and further until everybody

19:45.920 --> 19:50.160
had an ether theory to match their favorite observation. And just like with ether, some

19:50.160 --> 19:55.280
scholars have called this multiplicity of models a crisis for the dark matter community, contrasting

19:55.280 --> 19:59.760
the minimal evidence of any one model with the massive amounts of effort that have gone to

19:59.760 --> 20:04.000
experimentally testing them. Dark matter is one of those particles that for decades physicists

20:04.000 --> 20:08.640
have been saying they're going to find it in the next 10 years. And haven't. We just need to build

20:08.640 --> 20:13.280
a particle collider the size of Earth's orbit. Then we'll find it. Given everything I've learned

20:13.280 --> 20:18.080
about dark matter, I'm inclined to agree with astrophysicists more to hide Milgram's take on the

20:18.080 --> 20:25.280
search. If one does not presuppose anything about what dark matter is, about what its interactions

20:25.280 --> 20:32.240
with baryons and with itself are, besides gravity, and about how it got to where it is,

20:32.960 --> 20:39.040
then it is hard to rule out. My God, the shade. He's kind of right, though. It is pretty hard to

20:39.040 --> 20:43.040
rule out a theory when you have no evidence. And you might be thinking, but what about those

20:43.040 --> 20:48.320
rotation curves? We learned a whole graph for it. Isn't that evidence of something? Well, it could be.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.480
Or we could just be wrong about gravity again.

20:50.880 --> 21:02.400
Remember earlier when I said that Mercury had a weird orbit and that in order to explain it,

21:02.400 --> 21:07.040
astronomers predicted there might be another planet closer into the sun? So even though this was

21:07.040 --> 21:11.040
wrong, there was good context for it. French mathematician and astronomer,

21:11.040 --> 21:17.280
Urban Leverrier, Urban Leverrier, Urbane Leverrier, whatever his name was, the guy who identified

21:17.280 --> 21:22.800
Mercury's weird orbit had actually predicted the existence of Neptune just a few years earlier

21:22.800 --> 21:28.320
based on weirdness in Uranus's orbit. He used Newtonian gravity to analyze the orbit of Uranus

21:28.320 --> 21:32.560
and found it to be slightly off from what the observers were measuring, so he deduced that

21:32.560 --> 21:37.920
there must be another planet there that nobody had seen yet, causing these gravitational perturbations.

21:37.920 --> 21:42.880
And there was. He sent his calculations to an observer who identified Neptune literally that

21:42.880 --> 21:47.920
same evening. Truly a testament of Newtonian mechanics' predictive power. So when he found

21:47.920 --> 21:53.440
similar gravitational anomalies in Mercury's orbit, he theorized that there may be, once again,

21:53.440 --> 21:57.680
an unidentified planet to blame. And since he was so successful last time he did that,

21:57.680 --> 22:02.320
the community went all in. The search began, sub-theories proliferated, and they even gave

22:02.320 --> 22:07.520
the putative planet a name, Vulcan. There's a weirdly high rate of almost having things called

22:07.520 --> 22:12.080
Vulcan in astronomy. Some of it precedes Star Trek. But as we know today, there is no planet

22:12.080 --> 22:16.240
Vulcan. And it wasn't until a century later that Einstein's theories of relativity came

22:16.240 --> 22:22.160
along to explain why. Newtonian gravity just wasn't adequate to predict an orbit as close

22:22.160 --> 22:26.800
into the Sun's gravitational influence as Mercury. I share this example of planet predictions

22:26.800 --> 22:32.320
because it illustrates two diverging responses to failed experiments. You make a prediction,

22:32.320 --> 22:36.240
you take a measurement, your prediction doesn't match your measurements. What do you do? Well,

22:36.240 --> 22:41.280
when it came to Uranus, the answer was to imagine what other stuff might be affecting the data and

22:41.280 --> 22:46.000
then look for that stuff. And sometimes that works. But when it came to Mercury, it wasn't that there

22:46.000 --> 22:52.000
was unaccounted for stuff. It was that the theory the predictions were based on was inadequate.

22:52.000 --> 22:57.200
Do you see where I'm going with this? On the whole, the astronomy community in the last century-ish

22:57.200 --> 23:01.200
has determined that in order to resolve the difference between what we see and what we

23:01.200 --> 23:06.880
predict in galaxies, there must be some stuff out there that we're not seeing. Neptune must exist,

23:06.880 --> 23:11.520
so to speak. But what if dark matter isn't like Neptune? What if it's like Mercury? What if the

23:11.520 --> 23:16.960
assumptions we use to make this were just wrong? Well, that guy Milgram, who's brutal dressing

23:16.960 --> 23:21.680
down of the search for dark matter, I just quoted, kind of developed a whole theory for this. It's

23:21.680 --> 23:28.160
called Modified Newtonian Dynamics, or MOND, and it's an alternate explanation for the dark matter

23:28.160 --> 23:32.800
observations that makes adjustments to our understanding of gravity instead of inventing

23:32.880 --> 23:39.280
invisible ether stuff. Milgram published his first paper on MOND in 1983, 50 years after the term

23:39.280 --> 23:44.000
dark matter was coined by Fritz Zwicky. And while, as I'll get to in a minute, it's not exactly a

23:44.000 --> 23:49.520
popular theory, it is legitimate insofar as there are hundreds of peer-reviewed papers on it. It's

23:49.520 --> 23:53.440
fringe, but it's decidedly not in crackpot territory. Now, I'm not going to get into the

23:53.440 --> 23:58.800
mathematics here, mostly because I refuse to ever show an equation on this channel on principle,

23:58.800 --> 24:04.800
but in the same way that Einstein's relativity usurped Newtonian mechanics because it was more

24:04.800 --> 24:11.040
broadly applicable in the situations of extremely high speed or gravity, MOND proposes additions

24:11.040 --> 24:15.920
that also account for very low accelerations, which becomes more relevant when you're considering

24:15.920 --> 24:20.240
things on the size scale of galaxies, for example. If you want all the math, you can go read the

24:20.240 --> 24:24.160
papers yourself. My references are in the description. I feel like when my old college

24:24.160 --> 24:29.040
professors would like introduce an idea and be like, and you can go home and do the derivation

24:29.040 --> 24:34.640
for fun if you want. And it's like, what nerds actually did that? I did that. The important

24:34.640 --> 24:38.960
thing is that by making tweaks to our current understanding of gravity, we would be able to

24:38.960 --> 24:43.520
make predictions for the rotation curves of galaxies that match our observations better.

24:43.520 --> 24:49.600
But like previous changes to gravity, MOND doesn't negate what came before it so much as add to it.

24:49.600 --> 24:54.480
MOND makes gravity predictable in a wider range of situations, and there's actually

24:54.480 --> 24:59.520
decently compelling evidence for MOND. Unlike most models of dark matter, people have actually used

24:59.520 --> 25:05.280
it to make successful predictions in advance of seeing data instead of adapting to data after

25:05.280 --> 25:08.880
the fact, which you would think would be an important quality to consider when evaluating

25:08.880 --> 25:13.280
competing theories, but as we'll get to later, not the most important. And to be clear, I'm not

25:13.280 --> 25:18.080
going to sit here and pretend that MOND is definitely the more correct hypothesis. I think the strongest

25:18.080 --> 25:22.560
argument against it is that it can't account for everything. In particular, it's not very good at

25:22.560 --> 25:27.760
explaining the cosmological scale dark matter observations that I didn't get into because

25:27.760 --> 25:33.520
this video needs some bounds. But when it comes to galaxy scale observations like our rotation curves,

25:33.520 --> 25:38.720
papers published as recently as last year argue that MOND actually works better than any one model

25:38.720 --> 25:43.120
of dark matter. I should also mention that there are more theories of modified gravity than just

25:43.120 --> 25:47.280
MOND, and some of them do a better job with the cosmology stuff. Kind of similar to how there

25:47.360 --> 25:52.160
are many models of dark matter that each do better or worse at explaining different pieces of evidence.

25:52.160 --> 25:56.320
I'll just say MOND for the rest of the video, but know that I'm using it as a shorthand to

25:56.320 --> 26:02.320
refer to the multiplicity of models that solve dark matter by updating gravity rather than

26:02.320 --> 26:08.800
inventing space ether. But as interesting as this theory is, the field doesn't really like it. As in,

26:09.360 --> 26:14.720
and forgive me for generalizing, but most astronomers do not take MOND seriously as an

26:14.720 --> 26:21.040
option for explaining dark matter. Anecdotally, I can say that in my 10 years studying astrophysics,

26:21.040 --> 26:26.640
I had only ever heard MOND referred to once in earnest, and any other time I had heard anybody

26:26.640 --> 26:32.000
mention it, it's been as a joke. Like, look at those kooky MOND researchers who think they're

26:32.000 --> 26:40.160
gonna solve gravity. So silly. Who's even funding them? MOND is like astronomy's embarrassing cousin

26:40.160 --> 26:46.240
that gets lumped in with ET research and is like in the space of technically legitimate but

26:46.240 --> 26:51.040
effectively crackpotty? Actually, that's not true. People respect SETI. I'm gonna go out on a limb

26:51.040 --> 26:56.480
and say most astronomers take them more seriously than they do the MOND people. But beyond my own

26:56.480 --> 27:00.960
personal experience, you just have to look at an astronomy textbook to see the institutional

27:00.960 --> 27:06.960
erasure of MOND as a viable solution for dark matter. Here's what my first astro textbook

27:06.960 --> 27:12.560
says about dark matter. To explain these nearly uniform orbital speeds in the outer parts of the

27:12.560 --> 27:19.280
galaxy, astronomers conclude that a large amount of matter must lie outside the sun's orbit.

27:19.280 --> 27:24.160
This unseen material, which is by far the predominant constituent of our galaxy,

27:24.160 --> 27:32.080
is called dark matter. Not astronomers hypothesize. Not astronomers are evaluating. Astronomers

27:32.080 --> 27:38.960
conclude there is unseen material and is called dark matter. I looked through all of my old textbooks

27:38.960 --> 27:45.440
that I had lying around and all of them had sections on, you know, dark matter that described

27:45.440 --> 27:52.000
machos and wimps and axions and all that stuff, but literally no mention of the possibility of

27:52.000 --> 27:58.000
other formulations of gravity. Curious. Finally, we can compare the distribution of papers published

27:58.000 --> 28:03.840
on each topic. Doing a quick search on NASA ADS, which is the place to search for astrophysics

28:03.840 --> 28:10.000
articles, we get nearly 80,000 hits for papers with the keywords dark matter and only 1,600

28:10.000 --> 28:15.040
with the keyword MOND. That's a difference of nearly two orders of magnitude. That's huge.

28:15.040 --> 28:21.040
I bring all this up. MOND's complete absence from textbooks, the relative lack of research

28:21.040 --> 28:26.000
conducted on it and the way it's literally treated as a joke by people I know. To support the claim

28:26.000 --> 28:31.200
that as a community, the field of astrophysics has made a choice. And I'm not saying that the

28:31.200 --> 28:35.920
Council of Astronomers who demoted Pluto got together again to suppress MOND. I'm saying that

28:35.920 --> 28:41.680
we hit this phenomenological fork in the road, the dark matter observations, and we had the options

28:41.680 --> 28:48.320
of inventing something or adjusting our models. And despite what I see as a good amount of compelling

28:48.320 --> 28:54.080
but non-conclusive evidence supporting the validity of either option, the field has very clearly

28:54.080 --> 28:59.040
made a decision. And this is really interesting to me because it is such a good example of the

28:59.040 --> 29:05.360
problem in thinking that science is some linear march towards objective truth where we get closer

29:05.360 --> 29:12.480
and closer to the end by using our manly emotionless rationality. That attitude towards science lacks

29:12.480 --> 29:18.160
the complexity of making choices. Like a great philosopher once said, everybody got choices.

29:18.160 --> 29:22.960
Even scientists got choices. Is that a particle we didn't see? Take another shot of modified

29:23.920 --> 29:28.320
gravity? That was a pretty deep cut, but I couldn't not. And I cannot stress this enough.

29:28.320 --> 29:34.720
Those choices are not a failure of the scientific method. In fact, they're necessary for the pursuit

29:34.720 --> 29:40.160
of science to go anywhere at all. Wow, what a cliffhanger. I don't know about you, but I'm excited

29:40.160 --> 29:43.840
to see where this is going. But before we get to that, I got to do my least favorite part of the

29:43.840 --> 29:48.560
video. The part where I give you the uncomfortable choice of paying for the content you're watching

29:48.560 --> 29:53.600
or not. See, I have this kind of idealistic belief that if I make something good and put it out into

29:53.600 --> 29:58.640
the world, then enough people will volunteer to pay me for it that I can keep it free for everybody

29:58.640 --> 30:03.680
who can't and not have to succumb to the various sponsor requests in my inbox. Because wouldn't

30:03.680 --> 30:07.440
it be cool if I could get paid for my work without trying to sell my viewers something they probably

30:07.440 --> 30:13.200
don't want or need? I think so. But I do understand it's a choice. Some reasons one might choose not

30:13.200 --> 30:18.000
to support me on Patreon are because they can't afford $3 a month, because they don't think the

30:18.000 --> 30:22.960
videos I make are worth that, or because they're three raccoons in a trenchcoat and don't understand

30:22.960 --> 30:28.480
the idea of compensation. I know my sincerity reads a sarcasm sometimes, but I really do sympathize

30:28.480 --> 30:32.720
with all those reasons. Especially the raccoon one, you would have no idea what's going on.

30:32.720 --> 30:38.080
But some reasons one might choose to subscribe to my Patreon are to watch exclusive videos,

30:38.080 --> 30:43.440
where I answer questions patrons ask me or interview other creators, get access to the

30:43.440 --> 30:49.440
ad-free versions of my video essays, and help me pay my bills while still making this YouTube stuff.

30:49.440 --> 30:53.920
Both choices are valid, and while they're certainly one that I'd prefer, I do understand

30:53.920 --> 30:57.840
that there can be good reasons either way. So to those already supporting me on Patreon,

30:57.840 --> 31:02.880
thank you. You're amazing. To those who already know they won't, that's fine. I'm still glad

31:02.880 --> 31:08.000
you're here. And to those considering it, you are the population who will determine how long I

31:08.000 --> 31:12.720
can keep doing this. No pressure. Just trying to help you make informed decisions. Okay, that's enough

31:12.720 --> 31:18.160
discussion of like personal finance choices. Let's get back to the fun stuff. Science choices.

31:27.840 --> 31:31.600
So I know a lot of people think that science is just the straightforward application of the

31:31.600 --> 31:38.400
scientific method, and that's very cute. The fact that this is only kind of sometimes what the process

31:38.400 --> 31:43.440
of scientific research looks like is a huge topic that I will probably make a whole video about

31:43.440 --> 31:48.800
whenever I get around to reading against method. But today, I want to draw our attention to that

31:48.800 --> 31:54.800
ineffable initiation of inquiry, the hypothesis. The formulation of a hypothesis has been called

31:54.800 --> 31:59.520
the most mysterious step of the scientific method, because it's kind of hard to explain

31:59.520 --> 32:04.960
exactly where a hypothesis comes from, how a hypothesis is constructed, if you will. The

32:04.960 --> 32:10.240
choice of a hypothesis is so crucial to the whole scientific process, because what you choose to

32:10.240 --> 32:15.680
study determines what you're gonna find out. This is especially important when you have multiple

32:15.680 --> 32:20.720
or conflicting hypotheses. How do you decide which one to point the scientific method at?

32:20.720 --> 32:26.400
One might naively think, well, just systematically test all the hypotheses in whichever is the most

32:26.400 --> 32:31.440
successful determines where your theory goes. So objective. But the inherent futility of this

32:31.440 --> 32:36.800
strategy is exactly what drove philosopher Robert Piercig, who was a university biochemistry student

32:36.800 --> 32:42.720
at the age of only 15, to abandon science entirely after only a few years of research. While doing

32:42.720 --> 32:48.800
laboratory work, he became obsessed with the idea of hypotheses in and of themselves, and in particular,

32:48.800 --> 32:54.320
their tendency to multiply. As you test one hypothesis, he realized, many more hypotheses will

32:54.320 --> 32:58.880
come to mind. And then when you go to test the first of those, you would get hit by yet another

32:58.880 --> 33:04.560
flood of hypotheses. The more science you do, the more untested hypotheses you have. At first,

33:04.560 --> 33:09.360
he thought this was amusing and came up with like a jokie law saying that the number of rational

33:09.360 --> 33:15.840
hypotheses that can explain any given phenomenon is infinite. But over time, his amusement transformed

33:15.840 --> 33:22.240
into a deep nihilism about scientific reasoning and its potential to lead humans to true knowledge

33:22.240 --> 33:27.440
of nature. If the purpose of the scientific method is to select from among a multitude of

33:27.440 --> 33:33.440
hypotheses, and if the number of hypotheses grows faster than experimental method can handle,

33:33.440 --> 33:39.520
then it is clear that all hypotheses can never be tested. If all hypotheses cannot be tested,

33:39.520 --> 33:45.120
then the results of any experiment are inconclusive, and the entire scientific method falls short of

33:45.120 --> 33:51.200
its goal of establishing proven knowledge. Establishing proven knowledge. How much you

33:51.200 --> 33:54.560
want to bet Piercig was one of those science students who picked the subject because of how

33:54.560 --> 33:59.040
much he likes that there's only one single definite answer to each question. I say that

33:59.040 --> 34:03.440
like I wasn't also that student at one point. I thought I was so clever just choosing to learn

34:03.440 --> 34:10.240
absolute truths about the universe. For Piercig, this realization of infinite hypotheses along

34:10.240 --> 34:15.680
with the lack of rational tools to choose between them was catastrophic for his ability to do science.

34:15.680 --> 34:20.480
And I guess because he couldn't reconcile these complications with what I'm assuming was his starting

34:20.480 --> 34:26.640
point of dogmatic scientific rationalism and objective truth-seeking, he dropped out of university

34:26.640 --> 34:31.120
just a few years later. But others have realized these complicating aspects of science without

34:31.120 --> 34:36.800
having existential crises. For example, in The Island of Knowledge, The Limits of Science and

34:36.800 --> 34:42.400
the Search for Meaning, Brazilian astrophysicist Marcelo Gleiser uses a metaphor of an island

34:42.400 --> 34:47.920
to describe how increasing knowledge actually takes us further from a final truth.

34:47.920 --> 34:53.040
As The Island of Knowledge grows, so do the shores of our ignorance, the boundary between

34:53.040 --> 34:58.160
the known and unknown. Learning more about the world doesn't lead to a point closer to a final

34:58.160 --> 35:04.080
destination, whose existence is nothing but a hopeful assumption anyways, but to more questions

35:04.080 --> 35:09.920
and mysteries. According to Gleiser, Piercig's problem of infinite hypotheses wasn't a flaw

35:09.920 --> 35:15.680
of the scientific method so much as a fundamental feature of human's knowledge acquisition. By

35:15.680 --> 35:21.520
seeking more and more information, we're not converging on truth, but fractaling out into

35:21.520 --> 35:25.920
complexity. The more you know, the more you know you don't know.

35:33.920 --> 35:39.040
So if trying to answer questions leads to more questions, and if we only have finite time and

35:39.040 --> 35:45.280
resources to attempt answering some questions, then we still need to figure out how do we choose

35:45.360 --> 35:50.160
which hypotheses to pursue. Well, we've talked about Einstein's sum in this video and he seems

35:50.160 --> 35:54.720
to have landed on some pretty good theories, so what did he think about how we should find our

35:54.720 --> 36:01.120
way to the best truths? The supreme task is to arrive at those universal elementary laws,

36:01.120 --> 36:06.240
from which the cosmos can be built up by pure deduction. There is no logical path to these

36:06.240 --> 36:12.960
laws. Only intuition, resting on sympathetic understanding of experience, can reach them.

36:12.960 --> 36:18.800
Intuition? Sympathetic understanding? What do you think all the Einstein fanboys would think if

36:18.800 --> 36:23.920
they knew their physics god believed that feelings are how we solve the universe? Einstein's not

36:23.920 --> 36:28.320
the only one who says this, by the way. In his writings on how theories are modified over time,

36:28.320 --> 36:33.200
the French physicist and philosopher Pierre Duem suggests that scientists have to follow their

36:33.200 --> 36:38.880
good sense. And this was directly in response to the philosophical question of how to decide

36:38.880 --> 36:44.400
if a challenged theory should change in its foundational premises or the surrounding assumptions.

36:44.400 --> 36:47.840
In other words, the exact kind of fork in the road we see with dark matter and

36:47.840 --> 36:52.320
bond. Do we go back and revise or do we press on and add more? At the present moment,

36:52.320 --> 36:56.160
I don't think we have enough evidence in either direction to know for sure, but as I've already

36:56.160 --> 37:02.240
argued, a decision has been made. And while I agree with Einstein and Duem's ideas of some kind of

37:02.240 --> 37:07.360
intellectual intuition that guides us through the inherently open-ended parts of the scientific

37:07.360 --> 37:12.640
method, and unlike Piercig, I believe that it's fine for this to be how science works and not

37:12.640 --> 37:18.320
evidence of its failure, I think there's an important difference between an individual scientist

37:18.320 --> 37:25.520
going off vibes and a collection of scientists going off vibes in a patterned way. Or there would

37:25.520 --> 37:31.200
be if there was actually such a thing as an individual scientist. You see, despite their aura of pure

37:31.200 --> 37:34.720
objectivity, scientists also live in a society.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.880
So now that we have some context, I want to come back to this question of what does it mean for

37:46.880 --> 37:51.520
science to be socially constructed. Like I said at the top of this video, today I'm interested

37:51.520 --> 37:56.720
in the mid-strength constructivist regime that claims the substance of scientific theories can

37:56.800 --> 38:01.200
be influenced by social factors. And I have a really good example of this that is not at all

38:01.200 --> 38:06.240
related to astrophysics. Science historian Everett Mendelssohn has done some really fascinating work

38:06.240 --> 38:13.120
analyzing the socio-political forces that led to a reductionist approach to biology in 1840s Germany,

38:13.120 --> 38:18.160
a time and place characterized by significant political unrest, emerging revolutionary movements,

38:18.160 --> 38:24.480
and an anti-autocratic energy among the youths. Mendelssohn argued that this particular social

38:24.480 --> 38:30.000
milieu, the same one that produced a young Karl Marx in fact, resulted in a young,

38:30.000 --> 38:34.960
alienated intellectual group that sought to create counter concepts. Whether through science or

38:34.960 --> 38:40.880
politics, they wanted to challenge the old order and their explanations for the world. Reductionism,

38:40.880 --> 38:45.280
the idea that you can best understand things by breaking them down to their fundamental pieces,

38:45.280 --> 38:50.160
was at the time considered controversial and revolutionary and therefore was in line with

38:50.160 --> 38:55.520
the counter-cultural moment. And that's cool, I guess. The interesting part is that at the exact

38:55.520 --> 39:01.440
same time, biologists in France were having their own scientific revolution, except their shift was

39:01.440 --> 39:08.800
towards a holistic, organismic paradigm of biology, which is the antithetical approach to reductionism,

39:08.800 --> 39:13.440
their opposites. Or at least they were opposite at the time. Apparently modern biology has made

39:13.440 --> 39:17.280
some advances towards synthesizing the two approaches, which is cool. Good for them.

39:17.280 --> 39:21.200
Shout out to the biologists who read the script for me. Of the stark difference between French

39:21.200 --> 39:27.600
and German biological paradigms, Mendelssohn says, The very existence of such a marked difference

39:27.600 --> 39:33.680
almost demands a parallel investigation of the mix of cognitive, institutional, and social factors

39:33.680 --> 39:37.840
west of the Rhine. You'll have to read his papers for a more detailed explanation of what

39:37.840 --> 39:43.040
those factors were, but the important thing here is that differences in the social, political,

39:43.120 --> 39:50.000
or institutional contexts led to differences in the approach to formulating scientific theories.

39:50.000 --> 39:56.080
The dark matter, Mend's split, is to an extent an analogous situation. Two antithetical paradigms

39:56.080 --> 40:00.480
for solving a science problem. But the dichotomy is less visible because of what I think is the

40:00.480 --> 40:05.920
monopolizing tendency of American research. Interestingly, more of the top-sided Mend research

40:05.920 --> 40:10.960
comes from outside of the US as opposed to the top-sided dark matter research, so maybe the split

40:10.960 --> 40:14.880
here isn't as clear as Germany versus France, and it's more like the United States research

40:14.880 --> 40:20.400
industrial complex versus a small population of random foreign scientists. I'm not sure about

40:20.400 --> 40:25.360
that detail, but the point is, different contexts leads to different science. And I'm going to get

40:25.360 --> 40:31.520
to my theory on the context that produced the dark matter choice, but first, I want to touch on why

40:31.520 --> 40:36.560
this kind of analysis matters at all. Because the social constructedness of science doesn't just

40:36.640 --> 40:42.880
dictate how science happens, it also determines how it will interact with the rest of society.

40:42.880 --> 40:49.200
For example, via policy, education, or public communication. There are so many situations

40:49.200 --> 40:54.000
where the subjective decision-making necessary to do science has been socially influenced in

40:54.000 --> 40:59.440
negative ways. The choice of how much effort to invest in researching a cure for AIDS in the 80s.

40:59.440 --> 41:03.760
Or the existence of completely legitimate scientific research that exists solely to sell

41:03.760 --> 41:08.080
particular food products. Or the kinds of algorithms and software that venture capital

41:08.080 --> 41:12.560
is investing in right now. Or the decision to launch the space shuttle challenger when they did.

41:12.560 --> 41:16.480
That one's actually really interesting. There's a whole argument that the particular ways in

41:16.480 --> 41:21.280
which people were visualizing data in order to communicate to project leadership is why

41:22.480 --> 41:27.760
what happened happened. And, you know, data visualization is definitely a subjective choice.

41:27.760 --> 41:32.000
I should do a video on that. Comment below if you want a video on data visualization.

41:32.000 --> 41:36.720
None of these are just outcomes of the straight logical path towards linear progress.

41:36.720 --> 41:42.320
They're choices that are influenced by and subsequently influence politics. And like,

41:42.320 --> 41:46.080
please don't reduce this to me saying that science is just a political tool.

41:46.080 --> 41:52.480
Science can be used to many ends, and a lot of them are good, but, dare I say, some of them,

41:52.480 --> 41:57.600
sometimes are bad. Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?

41:57.600 --> 42:03.120
And I'm not saying the way to avoid doing socially bad science is to remove the subjectivity.

42:03.120 --> 42:06.720
Frankly, I don't think that's possible. I think the more productive takeaway is the

42:06.720 --> 42:12.560
need for transparency and self-awareness in those choices so they can be as well-informed as possible.

42:12.560 --> 42:17.760
In a 1996 paper titled, Is Science Socially Constructed? And Can It Still Inform Public

42:17.760 --> 42:23.040
Policy? Scholar of Science and Technology Studies Sheila Jasenoff answers both questions with a

42:23.040 --> 42:28.320
resounding and well-justified yes, emphasizing the importance of being aware of this multiplicity

42:28.320 --> 42:34.000
of paths scientists can take. As one probes more deeply into the causes of policy-relevant

42:34.000 --> 42:40.320
controversies, one finds that science's inability to answer questions is rarely the most pressing

42:40.320 --> 42:46.000
problem. People are often convinced that they have the right scientific answer. Constructivist

42:46.000 --> 42:51.600
analysis, which seeks even handedly to explain variations in beliefs about the world,

42:51.600 --> 42:57.600
discovers in many such instances that disagreements about the right way to answer the quote-unquote

42:57.600 --> 43:03.360
same question reflected deeper disagreements about what the disagreement really is.

43:03.360 --> 43:08.240
So in order to get the maximum benefit of using science to inform any kind of public policy,

43:08.240 --> 43:15.600
we have to be able to do the meta-analysis of which questions should we be asking to science.

43:15.600 --> 43:20.080
And that is outside the purview of the scientific method. It's a skill set,

43:20.160 --> 43:24.720
nuclear physicist Alvin Weinberg called trans-science. Understanding science

43:24.720 --> 43:30.000
as social constructiveness is also really important in education. In the US, physics education,

43:30.000 --> 43:36.720
especially at the earlier levels, frames learning science as collecting facts and tools that will

43:36.720 --> 43:42.800
lead one to uncovering objective truths. What isn't often taught is the cognitive flexibility

43:42.800 --> 43:49.120
required to make the judgment calls necessary to doing science. Remember Piercig? If he'd had a more

43:49.200 --> 43:54.480
epistemologically mature understanding of what the point of science even is, he probably wouldn't

43:54.480 --> 43:58.880
have had a crisis of faith that made him leave the field when he realized you can't be completely

43:58.880 --> 44:05.520
rational about all of it all of the time. If your goal doing science is to find objective truth through

44:05.520 --> 44:11.040
purely rational pathways, you're gonna get stuck the fuck up when you realize you can't find the

44:11.040 --> 44:16.000
one true path. Or I guess you can convince yourself that you found it and then everybody around you

44:16.000 --> 44:20.480
has to deal with your god complex. A complaint I hear all the time from research mentors and

44:20.480 --> 44:24.560
advisors is that their students don't know how to take initiative over their work. Like they're

44:24.560 --> 44:29.520
basically just obedient little robots who can do any analysis you instruct them to but really

44:29.520 --> 44:34.240
struggle to come up with their own ideas. I think that struggle comes at least partially from

44:34.240 --> 44:40.800
students' lack of belief in their own subjective reasoning skills and intuitive curiosity

44:41.280 --> 44:45.520
because we never teach them how to make imperfect decisions. I don't think we even

44:45.520 --> 44:51.280
tell them making imperfect decisions is okay, let alone necessary. For a more detailed discussion

44:51.280 --> 44:56.080
on the gap between physics students learned perfectionism and the decidedly non-perfectionist

44:56.080 --> 45:00.960
thinking necessary to do science, check out this article called Leaving the One True Path,

45:00.960 --> 45:06.000
Teaching Physics Without Single Correct Answers, where MyLen DePenta talks about their experience

45:06.000 --> 45:11.600
helping students unlearn rigid single solution thinking. Students often accepted the idea that

45:11.600 --> 45:16.560
historical models were imperfect but assumed that the goal of science was to find the single

45:16.560 --> 45:22.960
correct model. But there are no quote-unquote completely right answers. The finite number

45:22.960 --> 45:28.960
of acceptable solutions all have their downsides so the skill of using them isn't in memorizing

45:28.960 --> 45:35.520
or even deriving but in discerning which situations a model is well suited to. This helps students

45:35.520 --> 45:41.680
reject objectivity without rejecting accountability. And it's not just future scientists who have to

45:41.680 --> 45:47.120
have this knowledge flexibility. A lot of arguments against things like climate change or vaccine

45:47.120 --> 45:53.440
efficacy stem from, well, the science changed so the science must be wrong. Maybe if we did a better

45:53.440 --> 45:58.960
job of teaching people what science actually is and how we make it, they wouldn't be recreating

45:58.960 --> 46:03.440
Pearson's very rational breakdown every time they're confronted with updated information.

46:03.440 --> 46:07.680
Scientific literacy is a thing and it's more than just memorizing some fun facts or knowing

46:07.680 --> 46:12.880
how to manipulate equations. And on that note, the social constructiveness of science plays a huge

46:12.880 --> 46:18.000
part in determining what the public believes. An example of this I really like is the recent

46:18.000 --> 46:24.000
scientific validation of millennia old practices in eastern medicine and spirituality like yoga

46:24.000 --> 46:28.880
or acupuncture. Today there is peer-reviewed research proving the efficacy of these practices

46:28.880 --> 46:32.560
to the point that they're sometimes prescribed by doctors or covered by insurance.

46:32.560 --> 46:36.560
But while pointing scientific tools at these ancient methods didn't all of a sudden make

46:36.560 --> 46:42.160
them work better, it did make it so that large swaths of the population who would have dismissed

46:42.160 --> 46:47.840
them before as mystic bullshit would now take them seriously. They believe it because science said

46:47.840 --> 46:52.640
it was true. Science made it true for them, even though it had already been true for a lot of people

46:52.640 --> 46:58.240
for a long time. Similarly, at least to the extent that you probably have heard of dark matter and

46:58.240 --> 47:04.720
you probably haven't heard of Monde, your scientific knowledge of gravity has been socially constructed.

47:04.720 --> 47:07.840
Because while the physicists in my comment section are currently typing,

47:07.840 --> 47:13.120
well duh, scientists know that we're dealing with imperfect models and gravity is obviously

47:13.120 --> 47:17.440
incomplete. Who doesn't know that? The public doesn't always know that and they can only work

47:17.440 --> 47:23.200
with what we give them. So via what I feel safe to assess is the common belief that dark matter

47:23.200 --> 47:29.280
exists and gravity is just facts. Scientific knowledge is socially constructed. The way

47:29.280 --> 47:35.440
scientists do the science has space for variation while still being science. But the reasons for

47:35.440 --> 47:40.400
that variation are not because of the science, they're because of the science's context.

47:40.400 --> 47:46.240
If you buy that whole German-French biology analysis, things like political climate and

47:46.240 --> 47:52.160
social milieu can influence the direction scientists pursue the infinite hypotheses

47:52.160 --> 47:57.840
available to them. And like I keep saying, the field of astrophysics has largely made a choice

47:57.840 --> 48:02.000
when it comes to dark matter. The logical conclusion I'm coming to is that there must

48:02.000 --> 48:06.720
be some contextual reason for us choosing dark matter, which begs the question...

48:15.520 --> 48:20.800
Okay, so this is the highly speculative and squishy part of the video where I share

48:21.440 --> 48:27.600
the broader trends that, at least in my mind, seem aligned with the hard lean towards explaining

48:27.600 --> 48:32.800
the dark matter observations with space ether instead of more complicated gravity. I have

48:32.800 --> 48:38.320
one pitch for a purely socio-political factor because that's what this video is about. But I

48:38.320 --> 48:42.560
would be remiss if I didn't mention the institutional factors that are at play as well.

48:42.560 --> 48:48.880
TLDR, academic publishing in the United States, is literally just a business that motivates researchers

48:48.880 --> 48:52.560
to heavily invest in whatever is already being heavily invested in.

48:52.560 --> 48:57.120
This isn't something specific to Mond and dark matter, by the way. This is just saying that

48:57.120 --> 49:02.160
if there's some small difference in people's interest in the two theories, the financial

49:02.160 --> 49:08.480
incentives of publishing would exacerbate and solidify that difference such that there is an

49:08.480 --> 49:13.920
obvious choice of which one you should study if you want a job. The Matthew Effect, a principle

49:14.000 --> 49:18.960
that says that a small advantage early on will snowball into a large advantage later on,

49:18.960 --> 49:24.080
has been measured in all aspects of publishing from journal impact to institutional ranking

49:24.080 --> 49:30.240
and even individual careers. And papers on novel research are actually biased against in journals

49:30.240 --> 49:36.000
even though they're more likely to become a top 1% most cited paper in the long term.

49:36.000 --> 49:40.800
Basically, financial incentives deter people from rocking the boat even though boat rocking is

49:40.800 --> 49:46.000
fundamentally necessary to progress science. But that's enough publishing and bibliometrics talk.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.960
If you want to hear more about it, go watch this other video that I made.

49:48.960 --> 49:53.840
My point here is that if there's enough of a reason to push scientists towards one direction

49:53.840 --> 49:59.760
even a little bit, then institutional incentives would solidify and exacerbate that choice.

49:59.760 --> 50:04.240
But this still begs the question, why the initial push towards dark matter?

50:04.240 --> 50:09.920
What were the post-big bang in homogeneities that led to the large-scale structure of the universe?

50:09.920 --> 50:14.000
Is a metaphor useful if you need an upper division cosmology course to understand it?

50:14.000 --> 50:16.560
I don't know, this joke's almost as obscure as the E41.

50:16.560 --> 50:18.720
What am I doing? Okay, here's my pitch.

50:18.720 --> 50:24.160
I think the collective subjective choice of choosing invisible stuff as an explanation

50:24.160 --> 50:29.840
for dark matter is consistent with physics' cultural value of simplicity.

50:29.840 --> 50:34.720
And if you don't think physics has a culture, congratulations, you're thinking like a physicist.

50:34.720 --> 50:41.280
Because believing that physicists have no culture is a well-documented part of physics' culture.

50:41.280 --> 50:45.760
But yeah, the physics community, at least in post-enlightenment western science,

50:45.760 --> 50:52.880
highly values solutions that are beautiful or elegant, like some kind of horny Occam's razor

50:52.880 --> 50:57.840
that prioritizes solutions so simple they require feminizing for some reason.

50:57.840 --> 51:01.760
Occam's razor, by the way, also called the principle of parsimony sometimes,

51:01.760 --> 51:06.640
is the idea that the solution that makes the fewest assumptions is usually the best solution.

51:06.640 --> 51:10.000
But as much as Occam's razor can be a helpful rule of thumb that prevents

51:10.000 --> 51:13.040
nerds like Piercig from having a complete mental breakdown,

51:13.040 --> 51:16.480
there is no rule that the universe has to be straightforward.

51:16.480 --> 51:21.120
A messy solution can in fact be more useful than a clean one, an elegant one.

51:21.120 --> 51:27.280
A really great example of simplicity as a driving value for physics is the search for a theory of

51:27.280 --> 51:34.800
everything. Hypothetically, a theory of knowledge would explain all aspects of the universe fully

51:34.800 --> 51:41.920
in one neat set of equations. Or ideally, one equation. Historically, we have had success

51:41.920 --> 51:47.760
with some kinds of unified theories. For example, Maxwell unified our theories of electricity and

51:47.760 --> 51:54.080
magnetism into electromagnetism. But a unified theory of everything that combines the electromagnetic

51:54.080 --> 51:58.400
force with the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force and even gravity?

51:58.400 --> 52:02.080
That's our holy grail. And I'll grant we've come kind of close.

52:02.080 --> 52:06.960
There are fairly solid models for a grand unified theory that explain all the forces except for

52:06.960 --> 52:11.360
gravity. A whole bunch of famous theories exist to make gravity play nice with the other forces.

52:11.360 --> 52:15.200
This is what string theory is trying to do, this is what m-theory is trying to do,

52:15.200 --> 52:20.320
this is what loop quantum gravity is trying to do, but no one's quite gotten it to work.

52:20.320 --> 52:24.800
Honestly, gravity's just really hard to pin down in general. Like we can predict what it does

52:24.800 --> 52:32.800
in some context, but we have absolutely no idea why. So the search for theories of everything

52:32.800 --> 52:38.240
is illustrative of modern physics' tendency towards simplification. And I think astronomy's

52:38.240 --> 52:43.760
attempt to explain the dark matter observations with space ether instead of further revisions to

52:43.760 --> 52:49.520
gravity is consistent with a broader desire to reduce everything to a few simple rules.

52:49.520 --> 52:53.600
Because we like for things to be simple. No more than that, we expect them to be.

52:53.600 --> 53:00.000
So we often study them as if they are. And I'm not trying to say this tendency is purely monkey

53:00.000 --> 53:04.640
brain's vibes based. The principle of parsimony is useful in a lot of contexts, and there are

53:04.640 --> 53:09.440
perfectly valid statistical and philosophical arguments for not rejecting it outright. And it

53:09.440 --> 53:15.360
is objectively a cool thing when you can explain multiple different problems with a single solution.

53:15.360 --> 53:20.000
And it's awesome that that is sometimes the solution that works best. But I don't think

53:20.000 --> 53:24.880
it's unreasonable to say that the assumption of simplicity can affect what scientists choose to

53:24.880 --> 53:30.720
study and how they choose to study it. Not necessarily in bad ways, but in ways that limit

53:30.720 --> 53:36.000
the knowledge we generate. In a second here, I'm going to wax philosophical on why physicists want

53:36.000 --> 53:40.400
everything to be simple. But first, I want to pose this video's discussion prompt for the comment

53:40.400 --> 53:44.720
section. If you're new here, I've been ending my videos with a question for the viewer at home

53:44.720 --> 53:49.200
to answer in the comments. And in the end of the next video, I'll share some of the answers I get

53:49.200 --> 53:54.400
from this video, prioritizing commenters who also comment on other people's comments,

53:54.400 --> 54:00.640
because that's how we make this a conversation. Today's question is, what are other examples

54:00.640 --> 54:06.480
of cultural values influencing the creation of knowledge in whatever field, discipline,

54:06.480 --> 54:11.840
or area of expertise you have experience in? What's a subjective principle you've seen

54:11.840 --> 54:17.120
affect how people explain things or even what things people choose to explain? And it doesn't

54:17.120 --> 54:22.560
have to be in academia, knowledge creation happens in lots of contexts and values are always involved.

54:22.560 --> 54:26.080
I know my viewers always come through with super interesting answers, so I'm really excited to

54:26.080 --> 54:29.840
see what we get with this one. So I hope you'll take a moment to share your unique perspective

54:29.840 --> 54:33.600
with me and the rest of the audience and check out other people's perspectives too,

54:33.600 --> 54:38.480
so you don't just have to trust mine. Did you do it? Great, thanks. So why do physicists want

54:38.480 --> 54:42.560
everything to be simple? I think the most compelling reason I've heard for this actually

54:42.560 --> 54:46.720
comes from an argument against grand unified theories, so it's a good thing that you already

54:46.720 --> 54:51.040
know what those are. That astrophysicist Glycer that I mentioned earlier who wrote Island of

54:51.040 --> 54:55.520
Knowledge also wrote a really interesting contribution to a book of essays called This Idea

54:55.520 --> 55:00.720
Must Die, Scientific Theories That Are Blocking Progress, which is a super fun read by the way.

55:00.720 --> 55:05.280
In his essay, he points out some of the shortcomings of existing unification theories,

55:05.280 --> 55:08.720
argues that the idea is nice but ultimately kind of naive,

55:08.720 --> 55:13.120
and proposes what he sees as an explanation for said naivete.

55:13.120 --> 55:19.760
The scientific impulse to unify is crypto-religious. The West has bathed in monotheism for thousands

55:19.760 --> 55:25.280
of years, and even in polytheistic cultures, there's always an Alpha God in charge. There's

55:25.280 --> 55:31.280
something deeply appealing in equating all of nature to a single creative principle. To decipher

55:31.280 --> 55:35.680
the mind of God is to be special, is to answer a higher calling.

55:35.680 --> 55:39.360
Okay, I know there's going to be people who have been with me this whole time whose brains just like

55:40.000 --> 55:43.840
shut off when they heard the word God. If it makes you feel better, Stephen Hawking,

55:43.840 --> 55:48.720
who was a very rational guy whose biopic was literally titled The Theory of Everything,

55:48.720 --> 55:54.560
initially believed in such theories but eventually abandoned it as well. But back to the God stuff.

55:54.560 --> 55:58.960
Despite the common belief that science and religion are opposite things that don't have

55:58.960 --> 56:02.960
anything to do with each other, there is a strong historical record that indicates that

56:02.960 --> 56:07.520
Enlightenment science was influenced by the cultural dominance of the church in Europe,

56:07.520 --> 56:13.200
and a particular puritanism that was the predecessor for modern physics' weird secular

56:13.200 --> 56:19.040
asceticism in the name of a god of rationality. Again, this one point will probably be a whole

56:19.040 --> 56:24.000
hour long video eventually. But for now, let's just say that the intermingling of science and

56:24.000 --> 56:29.280
religious thought, including western science and Christianity, is a well-documented part of

56:29.280 --> 56:34.080
its history. And I'm not trying to overstate the chain of causality here because social evolution

56:34.080 --> 56:39.840
is not so easily reducible. But the Abrahamic holdover of a single point of origin for all

56:39.840 --> 56:46.720
things just makes a lot of sense to me as the reason physicists tend towards a simple solution

56:46.720 --> 56:52.800
even in the face of a messy reality. It really feels like this desire to reduce the universe

56:52.800 --> 56:59.360
to a base set of equations is just repackaged monism with some scientific flavor. We want to

56:59.360 --> 57:04.240
make physics simple because deep down we know that we're all one, man. Damn, is that really

57:04.240 --> 57:08.400
where this video is landing? We made up dark matter because scientists want to believe in God,

57:08.400 --> 57:10.240
I guess so. Told you we'd get there.

57:17.520 --> 57:22.160
What a journey this has been. Unless this video convinced anyone that I'm not a serious

57:22.240 --> 57:26.640
scientist, I should clarify I'm not some diehard Mont supporter who thinks that dark matter

57:26.640 --> 57:31.920
definitely can't exist. I'm more just trying to make a point that sometimes scientists pedestal

57:31.920 --> 57:36.720
certain theories because of subjective values. I don't know what's definitely true, I'm just

57:36.720 --> 57:41.920
trying to see what I can glean from the situation by keeping an open mind. And like, who knows,

57:41.920 --> 57:46.320
maybe they're both right. If the biggest problem with either solution is that neither can explain

57:46.320 --> 57:51.840
all of the dark matter observations, then maybe there's some combo solution in which both things

57:51.840 --> 57:57.280
are contributing to what we see. Real talk, though, it barely matters which of these theories is right

57:57.280 --> 58:03.440
because it's astrophysics. The stakes are literally just ego. The thing that matters is that if we

58:03.440 --> 58:09.040
don't pay attention to how we construct scientific knowledge, we might not realize the effects it

58:09.040 --> 58:15.360
could have on people. And when it comes to actually materially useful fields like medicine or engineering

58:15.360 --> 58:22.240
or computer science or psychology, those impacts can do as much to harm as they can do to help.

58:22.240 --> 58:27.280
And as much as I am deeply a proponent of science for the sake of science, knowledge for the sake

58:27.280 --> 58:32.880
of knowledge, and don't need every question we attempt to answer to immediately have a tangible

58:32.880 --> 58:40.000
use for humanity, I also think that we should maybe kind of actively try not to make knowledge that

58:40.000 --> 58:45.120
is harmful. Maybe. And it's hard to do that if you can't even admit you're making it.

58:45.120 --> 58:50.320
So yeah, our scientific understanding of gravity is socially constructed, and we are almost certainly

58:50.320 --> 58:55.280
wrong about it in the exact same way that people at any point in the past have been wrong about it.

58:55.280 --> 59:01.520
And yet, we've accomplished incredible things with it, like landing people on the moon or sending

59:01.520 --> 59:07.280
a soundtrack of humanity to the furthest reaches of the solar system. Like, Einstein predicted

59:07.280 --> 59:12.560
gravitational waves 100 years ago, and in the last decade, we started measuring them accurately

59:12.560 --> 59:17.920
enough to detect when two black holes smash into each other in another galaxy. That is nothing

59:17.920 --> 59:25.040
short of amazing. I am amazed. Amazed. But as amazing as it is, we did still make that knowledge

59:25.040 --> 59:30.480
up, and we will continue to make knowledge up, and it will continue to be cool and useful and

59:30.480 --> 59:35.840
interesting. Social constructivism doesn't negate science or say that nothing is real or that

59:35.840 --> 59:41.120
everything is relative. It makes our understanding more complete by giving us a lens to analyze

59:41.120 --> 59:47.280
why we do what we do and why we think what we think. To deny the inherently subjective

59:47.280 --> 59:53.920
humanness in the endeavor of doing physics is to deny what pushed us to do it in the first place.

59:53.920 --> 01:00:00.880
Not ego or money or even utility, but curiosity. That spark that only comes when you realize that

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.440
you don't know something and that there might be more to the world than you thought before.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:11.680
That drive to describe the ineffable that we attempt to satisfy through art and religion and

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:17.040
yeah, even science. When you hear an astronomer wax poetic about the beauty of the cosmos,

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:22.240
that's not rationality, that's mythology. And a thousand years from now, when future humans look

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:26.800
back at whatever remaining record there is about dark matter from today, and they're inevitably

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:32.320
mixing up our science with our pop culture, and they go, look at those humans from way back in

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.560
the day that invented this invisible stuff because they didn't understand this super

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:42.720
simple thing about gravity that even kids know today. It'll be fine because gravity is a social

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:52.000
construct and that's okay. Hey everyone, welcome to the end of the video. Thank you so much for

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.680
making it here. I had a lot of fun with this video. It might honestly be my favorite one so far

01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:02.960
and I appreciate you watching it all the way to the end. In a second, I'm going to share some viewer

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:08.320
comments from my last video, which was about the tech industry and the TV show succession,

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:13.760
but first I gotta pay my bills. I already mentioned my Patreon and you probably know what Patreon is,

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:17.920
but just in case you don't, it's a website where you can sign up to give creators like me

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:23.040
a couple dollars a month in exchange for things like exclusive access to secret content,

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:30.080
having your names immortalized in my videos, and that tiny thing of helping me have an income.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.600
Like I said before, I really, really, really, really appreciate everybody who signed up already.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.520
I really encourage you to think about it if you're able to and if you're not, like, don't

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:44.240
worry about it. Otherwise, you can do the free things to support me, like liking the video,

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.640
sharing it with a friend, leaving a comment, subscribing to the channel. I know they all

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:53.520
seem kind of silly and small, but ultimately they make the numbers go up and that is what

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:58.240
determines how much I get paid. So enough of that, let's get into the succession comments.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:05.440
So for context, this last video was where I used the very popular HBO show succession

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:13.760
to examine how some decisions are made re-regulation of the tech industry. Basically,

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:20.160
the gist is that the tech industry can be quite harmful and regulation is often seen as the way

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:26.880
to prevent that harm and regulation can do some things to prevent harm, but it has limitations

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:33.200
because of the fact that it's a top-down solution and therefore is ultimately controlled by people

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:39.840
with power. And my conclusion was that regulation's fine, but we should try to consider a multiplicity

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:44.720
of solutions for the problems we face with the tech industry. And so I asked people to share

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:50.960
what might be some of those solutions, particularly, like, what might be solutions that people can

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:56.160
engage in, not, like, what should the government do to fix everything. So before I share the kinds

01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:02.160
of solutions that people suggested, I want to share one comment that I think is a really good framing

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:08.880
for the whole question of the role of, like, tech and software in, like, liberation projects.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:14.160
So this is from Kevin Hengehold, who I actually know through the Patreon. I got really excited

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.640
learning about data and big tech during lockdown because I saw all the hype around Cambridge

01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:23.920
Analytica and thought, fire with fire, right? But to build large-scale left-wing projects to

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:29.360
fight for workers' rights, housing rights, decommodified existence, etc., we need to develop

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:35.360
strong relationships that you can't get by A-B testing email subject lines. All that's to say,

01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:40.640
I think it's better to find the people fighting a good cause and use tech to support it rather than

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:46.480
saying how can tech solve x, which I think puts the cart before the horse. I think he completely

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:51.840
hit the nail on the head with that comment. Like, I see a lot of really well-intentioned people with

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.720
a lot of very technical expertise try to, like, hold up their technical expertise as the solution

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:03.440
to whatever problem is ailing society, and it's not that their expertise has no place in a solution,

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:10.560
but it is not enough on its own. And I think what Kevin pointed out as, like,

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:15.680
you can't fight fire with fire when you're trying to do something more meaningful than burn

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:22.240
everything down. Becoming the socialist software developer or whatever it was from the last video

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:28.000
requires more than just imitating the enemy. The master's tools will not dismantle the master's house

01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:35.840
but for algorithms. Now I've got three lifeboats or three solutions that a lot of people seem to

01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:41.840
converge on. The first is open-source software, which is when software is made free and publicly

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:48.160
available along with the code that created it so people can use it and modify it and build upon

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:54.480
it freely. Nick Albritton3796 says, I think it's important to kickstart and develop new open-source

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:59.760
software technologies and to hopefully start building that same concept into hardware technologies,

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:04.400
removing the profit drive and leaving only the incentive of why people develop and use that

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.400
tech in the first place. And a lot of people said something very similar and I agree. But I

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:13.120
think something that was really interesting to see was not exactly the criticisms people had of

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:19.360
open-source, but kind of the caveats that should be kept in mind when trying to implement open-source

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:25.600
projects that seem really important. For example, respectable user name says, definitely agree on

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:30.640
the promoting open-source, but also putting in place mechanisms to support people working on

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:35.920
open-source as so often these folks are effectively working for all these big tech companies literally

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:40.800
for free. And there was another interesting critique I saw from Mary Reverie who says,

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:46.880
open-source software is not without fault either. It is the transparent aspect of website text that

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:53.440
allowed for proprietary LLMs like GPT to be created. There is no free lunch, brunch, or dinner.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:58.000
Everyone has to think critically before putting stuff out. So yeah, open-source can be super

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.040
helpful in making more resources accessible to more people, but it does have the shortcoming that

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:09.120
big tech companies can take advantage of it just as easily as you or I. So the second lifeboat that

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:13.280
people converged on was education. And I know I talked about education in the video, but I was

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:17.520
mostly talking about college level education. There were actually a lot of people talking about

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:24.080
like K through 12 level education. So for example, Matias Lopez 6144 says, as a high school teacher

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:28.240
in Argentina, I have numerous students with different interests and political standpoints.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:33.200
Many of them want to be programmers and are excited about AI and untrusting of international

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:38.320
corporations. One lifeboat is to foster community building in high schools, opening the debate and

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:43.600
showing other ways to live and to understand both society and technology. Treating our students

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.080
with respect and engaging with their interests in a matter that fosters their passion, empathy,

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:52.800
and love for their future profession and for the rest of humanity has the potential for helping in

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:57.920
the change. Something I really appreciate about your comment Matias was that you mentioned empathy

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:06.720
and based in the work I've done in like college level education for engineering ethics is that

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:11.040
it's really hard to imagine people who are learning engineering and computer science and all

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:17.280
these things go on being empathetic in their careers and in the things they create when they

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:22.160
weren't necessarily treated very empathetically as they were learning how to do those things.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:26.480
And I feel like a lot of people might think it's weird to be like, we need to make engineers more

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:31.840
empathetic, but I kind of do think that's very important. And there were quite some other comments

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:37.280
from educators talking about engaging their students like this. John Hendricks 3253 says that

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:42.640
since 2016 they've taught a mini unit on media literacy where students learn strategies to

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:48.080
navigate and dismiss fake news, which is a really cool way to try to combat a specific harm of tech.

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:53.760
And there was even one high school student who talked about trying to engage their classmates

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:58.400
in conversations about tech and ethics and all this stuff. Misery of Micah says,

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:02.960
it seems really small, but being a high school student, soon to be college student,

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:07.600
I feel starting direct conversations with teachers and classmates about the role of technology in

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:13.120
our world would be a first step to decreasing anti-techno capitalist sentiment in this education

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:17.840
institution. I love that. And the last lifeboat I saw again and again was community engagement,

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:22.160
which made me very excited because I made a whole video about why that's so important for

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:30.320
doing any kind of politics. But I also saw someone talk about how community engagement

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:37.520
can kind of fill the personal hole that so many of us have that we try to fill with social media

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:43.200
and stuff like that. Burn Blue Fire K says, I think on the most individual level, what people need

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:47.840
is a sense of fulfillment or entertainment outside of what tech provides. Most people's

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:53.120
everyday use of tech or understanding of it just as a vehicle for content and or convenience.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:57.760
Addictive but hollow on both the creator and the audience side. Learn to love something

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:03.520
about the place you're in. It helps to naturally form an investment in seeing it thrive. Have that

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:07.840
be in people's focus rather than all the things we see online that are functionally intangible

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:12.240
and feel impossible to do anything about. These interests will naturally lead to connections

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:19.040
Point is, there are so many different ways that so many different people can participate in a

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:24.880
resistance against whatever kind of oppressive force, be it big tech or anything else. And it's

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.560
so much fun to see the different ideas people come up with. Thank you so much for everybody who

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:35.120
left a comment. I don't know how to end this. I kind of want to just like end on something

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:40.000
like controversial. Exoplanet research is a sham.
