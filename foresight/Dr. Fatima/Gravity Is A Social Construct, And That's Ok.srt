1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
In the philosophy of science, constructivism is the perspective that, while reality may exist

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,360
independent of our silly little human brains, scientific knowledge is socially constructed.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,720
But definitions are boring. Vibes are far more important.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,960
How do scientists feel about this idea? Let's examine the data.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,720
A perverse doctrine that subordinates rationality to politics and unbridled subjectivity.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,240
An indefensible reduction of all claims about nature to equally contingent status.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,680
A conspiracy of leftist humanists and social scientists against both science and western

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,200
civilization. Fascinating. I'm going to go ahead and say that most scientists, you know,

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,200
I could be wrong about this, but it's the impression I get from years in the field,

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,000
extensive study on the culture of science and, you know, being a person online.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,240
Most scientists don't find constructivism that helpful an idea. But lucky for you, I'm not

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,720
most scientists. My doctoral research was in astrophysics, but more recently I've been

13
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:06,240
publishing papers and making videos about the more social and political aspects of science.

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,080
And the whole point that I'm trying to get across is that even the hardest of the hard

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,600
sciences are still affected by messy people stuff. And I get the impression that some people are

16
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,600
kind of starting to come around to that idea, especially in fields like medicine or maybe

17
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:27,280
even technology, but not physics, right? Physics is just the fundamental truth about the universe.

18
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,640
Particles don't care about the political climate. Radiation doesn't discriminate against women.

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,080
Gravity isn't a social construct, right? In this video, I'm going to use gravity,

20
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,760
dark matter and a controversial, but in my opinion, compelling theory to illustrate why even the most

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:52,880
objective, rational, definitely not made up facts about the universe are indeed socially constructed.

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,640
And don't worry, I'm going to explain what that even means. But it's going to be a lighthearted

23
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,720
and fun video today. I promise this isn't going to end up being about racism or something heavy

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,320
like that about God, maybe, but not in the way you think. Just watch it. Trust me, it's going to be a good one.

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:31,840
Before we get into it, I want to lay out a few working definitions because I feel like a lot of

26
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,080
conversations about squishy human subjects like this tend to get stuck on semantics.

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,880
And social constructivism is definitely the kind of term that means different things in different

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,360
contexts. So if you're mostly here for the physics, bear with me for just a little while I talk about

29
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,120
sociology. Social constructivism is broadly the idea that the natural world just kind of exists,

30
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,480
and then scientific knowledge is what we create in our attempt to model the natural world,

31
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,560
but it is not the same as transcendent truth about the natural world. In other words,

32
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,200
knowledge is something we construct. One way to build a stronger intuition for what this means

33
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,440
is to consider the opposite philosophy, objectivism. Not that weird like A&Rand objectivism where

34
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,720
productivity is man's most noble calling or whatever. The scientific objectivist belief

35
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,880
that us mere mortals can in fact deduce fundamental truths about the universe

36
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,840
transcendent of approximations or models. But like many things in the social sciences,

37
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,800
these philosophies exist on a spectrum. On one end of the spectrum we have objectivism,

38
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,640
and on the other end strong constructivism. The two genders. Strong constructivism is where an

39
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,080
objective observer independent reality just doesn't exist. Or at least that us humans are

40
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,160
indelibly incapable of accessing it so it might as well not exist. Closer to the objectivist end,

41
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:58,640
we can consider a weak constructivism that proposes the goals of science at any given time can be

42
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,760
reflective of the surrounding culture or the vague claim that individual scientists work will

43
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,320
tend to follow the money. But somewhere between the weak and strong versions we have a whole lot

44
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,760
of epistemological question marks that constructivist analyses aim to answer. When does an experiment

45
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,480
sufficiently capture a natural phenomenon? What happens when theories conflict with each other?

46
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,560
How are unexpected outlying data points interpreted? And critically, how are any of these things

47
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,200
influenced by the people who are doing them? I've talked in videos before about the strong

48
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,160
constructivist end and the weak constructivist end, so today I'm concerning myself with this middle

49
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,920
area that's less about the nature of reality or the influence of politics and more about the choices

50
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,520
made in the process of conducting scientific research. In Act 1 we'll look at the science.

51
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,320
We'll go through a brief history of gravity, do a little primer on dark matter, and introduce a

52
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,120
theory that is attempting to challenge it. In Act 2 we'll get to more of the social side.

53
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,800
We'll learn how the scientific method is actually kind of messy,

54
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,120
get into how this messiness opens up space for subjective interpretations,

55
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,600
and look at what kinds of things can influence those interpretations.

56
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,880
We're going straight philosophy of physics today, and I for one am very excited.

57
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,160
Everyone ever has known that gravity exists. I want to like drop something as a demonstration,

58
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,000
but I don't actually have anything I want to drop.

59
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,080
Gravity. Even animals know what gravity is, at least to the extent that their behavior is

60
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,320
obviously informed by its existence. Like have you ever seen a cat do a really precise

61
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,800
jump over something? You can't tell me that that cat doesn't understand what parabolic

62
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,200
motion is just as well as any intro physics college student. Maybe not in equations or

63
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,720
words, but as an experience for sure. Arguably the only beings to ever not intuitively understand

64
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,040
that gravity exists are astronauts who just got back to earth and haven't yet remembered that

65
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,040
they can't just put things down in midair. Now you know you've got the space station right up there

66
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,120
that- I start with this comically basic understanding of what gravity is because

67
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,520
some people will inevitably try to counter the whole social construct thing with this level

68
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,320
of arguments. About it just being so obviously real and clearly not made up. So I bring up these

69
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,040
silly examples to illustrate the difference between some inarguably self-evident shared

70
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,720
experience and specific scientific descriptions of something, which is the part that I'm arguing

71
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,920
is socially constructed. Me, you, and the cat can all agree that there is definitely some

72
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:40,800
fundamentally real thing that makes some things fall into other things, but that is different

73
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,200
than a scientific theory and it precedes any attempt to characterize it. The earliest written

74
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,520
descriptions of gravity come from Greece and the Indian subcontinent and don't get much more advanced

75
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,720
than vague notions of things tend to fall down towards the earth instead of up towards the sky.

76
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,760
Neat. Eventually people started using numbers to describe this tendency more precisely and came

77
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,120
to the conclusion that things fall down towards the earth at an acceleration of about 9.8 meters

78
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,040
per second squared. The first mathematical formulation of gravity is often attributed

79
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,880
to Gal Leo in the 17th century, but his work was built on 11th century polymath Ibn Sina's work on

80
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,000
projectile motion, as well as 12th century polymath Abul Barakat al-Bardadi's relations between

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,480
acceleration and force. Really bummed that I missed the era of interdisciplinary Middle Eastern

82
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:30,160
scientists or artist scientists like Da Vinci actually helped this whole gravity progression

83
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,000
along in between painting seminal masterpieces. Da Vinci? Today's physicists can never. So with

84
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,600
this first quantitative description of gravity, we went from being able to predict that if you drop

85
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,360
something it will hit the ground to if you drop something this is how long it will take to hit

86
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,680
the ground. We did it. We made science. However, as mathematically rigorous as this description was,

87
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,680
it had limitations. The acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 ish meters per second squared that we use

88
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,600
in an intro physics class actually varies depending on latitude. Someone in Ecuador for example would

89
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,920
measure a slightly different gravitational acceleration than someone in Sweden and both of

90
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,720
them would measure something completely different than someone on say the surface of Mars. So while

91
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,040
this formulation of gravity was true enough to like hit a rival ship with a cannonball or something,

92
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,480
it was by no means internationally true, let alone universally true. We didn't get that until a guy

93
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:32,000
named Isaac iterated on the work of Galileo and another guy who thought therefore he was and came

94
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,760
up with what we now refer to as Newton's law of universal gravitation. Universal because this

95
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,880
description wasn't specific to gravity on the surface of the earth. Newton's formulation described

96
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,400
the gravitational force between any two bodies with mass, you and the earth, the earth and the sun,

97
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,280
Jupiter and the Galilean moons, whatever. Any two objects with mass will experience a

98
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,120
gravitational attraction between them that increases with either objects mass and decreases

99
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,160
with the distance separating them. Boom, we figured it out, but for real this time. We've cracked the

100
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,680
code to predict not only the motion of objects here on earth, but the orbits of the celestial bodies

101
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,960
and theoretically anything else in the universe with mass. We're definitely right this time.

102
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,280
But again, while more broadly useful than the previous Galilean formulation,

103
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Newton's law of universal gravitation wasn't quite as universal as he thought. For example,

104
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,680
in the 1800s astronomers had measured the orbit of the planet Mercury so precisely that they found

105
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,040
it to be inconsistent with what Newton's law of universal gravitation would predict. So they figured

106
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,120
that there has to be another planet in closer to the sun. Spoiler alert, there was no such planet.

107
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,680
It wasn't until Albert Einstein developed his theories of relativity at the start of the 20th

108
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,200
century that Mercury's weird orbit could be explained. The TLDR of relativity is that the

109
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,160
rates at which time passes can be altered by extremely high speeds or strong gravity. Time is

110
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,320
relative, so everything else is too. Relativity is trippy and weird and too complicated to explain

111
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,600
here, but the important thing that you need to know for our purposes is that we were able to make

112
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,880
even more precise predictions about gravity with it. And many experiments have supported

113
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,120
Einstein's theories of relativity. From Eddington's observations of gravitational

114
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,320
lensing during a solar eclipse in 1919 to measurements of stellar orbits around the

115
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,360
supermassive black hole SAJ star in the middle of our galaxy made just a few years ago. So we're

116
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,440
definitely right this time. As powerful as this set of theories is, even it has shortcomings.

117
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,480
Most famously, the relativistic construction of gravity is incompatible with quantum mechanics,

118
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,360
which is arguably the other most successful set of theories to come out of the last century of

119
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,440
physics. Both of these paradigms make extremely robust predictions in their own regimes. Relativity

120
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,200
describing interactions between the most massive objects like stars and black holes and quantum

121
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,720
mechanics describing interactions between the smallest things like particles and light waves.

122
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,960
But they break down if you try to consider them together because they each make different assumptions

123
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,760
about the underlying nature of reality. In quantum mechanics, causality is statistical,

124
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,040
almost random seeming. The rate of time passage is static, and the universe has some baseline

125
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,240
resolution, as if it's made out of really tiny pixels. For relativity to work, however, causality

126
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,000
is necessarily deterministic. One cause can yield only one effect. Time is relative, like we said

127
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,160
before, and the universe is continuous. There isn't some minimum size or mass that things can be.

128
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,320
This is a great opportunity to point out the problem with thinking of scientific knowledge as

129
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,680
either right or wrong. A naive, if not kind of understandable, reaction to these conflicting

130
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,640
theories might be to say, well, if they contradict, one of them must be wrong. But the reality is that

131
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:56,800
they both work. They both have predictive power. But each one has a particular context in which

132
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,160
its predictive power is reliable. In fact, it doesn't really make sense to call earlier theories of

133
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,920
gravity wrong either. Newtonian gravity works for certain contexts. Galilean gravity works for

134
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,320
certain contexts. Hell, even the ancient Greek models that were barely more sophisticated than a

135
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,760
cat's understanding of gravity works in certain contexts. I mean, the cat got over the thing,

136
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,240
didn't it? Sometimes the cat knowledge is enough. Each model accounts for the knowledge that was

137
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,800
available at the time and was iterated on as our new discoveries and ideas illuminated our ignorance.

138
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,960
And it's easy to look at this history of gravity and feel like we're coming closer and closer to

139
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,400
the truth. But in reality, it only seems like that in hindsight. When you learn a lineage of

140
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,440
increasingly successful theories in a physics class or science documentary, you generally don't learn

141
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,400
about the false darts and failed ideas that were necessary to get us to where we are today.

142
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,440
So to complicate matters a bit, we're going to shift gears into a modern problem in astrophysics

143
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,680
that continues to illuminate our ignorance about gravity, dark matter.

144
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,120
So I'm going to go ahead and hazard a guess that most of you have heard of dark matter before and

145
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,160
are at least vaguely aware of it as something that probably exists. As another astrophysical lady

146
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,320
YouTuber who I get compared to a whole lot has explained in a recent video of hers,

147
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,440
dark matter is not a theory, it is an observation. For our purposes today, I'm only going to explain

148
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,560
one of these observations as a mental foothold for my broader argument, but I will refer to some of

149
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,520
these other observations a little in passing. So if you want a more solid baseline explanation of the

150
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,400
full set of observations, go check out her video, if for no other reason than to hear the dark matter

151
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,720
dark matter. Do we need it? What is it? Where is it? How much iconic? So what is this observation

152
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,920
that we call dark matter? The graph I'm going to use to explain this is called a rotation curve,

153
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,800
and it shows how the speed objects in orbit around something changes as they get farther

154
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,080
away from that thing. So if we were to make a rotation curve of the solar system, for example,

155
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,600
this axis would be each planet's distance from the sun and each point's height would tell us how

156
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,360
fast the planet is orbiting. And we have a trend. The further the planet is, the slower it orbits,

157
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,320
because the force due to gravity, which is what's driving the orbit, gets weaker with distance.

158
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,280
But it's slightly more complicated than that. The mass that gravitationally drives the orbital

159
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,960
speed isn't just the thing in the center, it's everything inside the orbit. But because the sun

160
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:33,040
is so much more massive than even all the planets put together, the difference in mass inside Mercury's

161
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,720
orbit and the mass inside Pluto's orbit isn't that important. So the variation we see in this

162
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,760
rotation curve is mostly just because of the changing distance. If we were to make the same

163
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,880
graph for a galaxy rather than a solar system, we would expect the curve to look a little bit

164
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,520
different. Because the mass isn't as concentrated in the center, the further you get, the more

165
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,400
stuff you're orbiting, so instead of the graph dropping off quickly, it holds up for a while.

166
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,720
But once you get to the edge of the galaxy where there's not that much more stuff being added,

167
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,440
the graph should begin to drop. Or at least that's what we would have expected. Turns out,

168
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,840
when we measure the speeds of the furthest out orbiting stars and gas in galaxies,

169
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,240
they're going much faster than we'd expect, as if there was a lot more stuff inside those

170
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,000
far out orbits than we can see. And that difference between the rotation curve we'd predict based on

171
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,600
the mass of the matter we can see in the galaxy, and the actual rotation curve we get when we measure

172
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:36,960
how fast things are moving, is what we call dark matter. The term dark matter is simply a label

173
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:42,160
for a particular way in which our understanding of the universe is wrong. It is exactly this

174
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,640
wrong, and that wrongness is what dark matter is. It's not a theory, it's a set of observations,

175
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,040
and this is one of them. Now everything I've said so far is just kind of categorically true.

176
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,840
This is the prediction that our currently accepted models of gravity expect, and this

177
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,640
is the measurement we see when we try to test those models. Neither of these things is really up for

178
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,920
debate. I mean, I could probably make it up for debate, but I won't. But even though what I'm

179
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,880
about to say next could be found in any intro astronomy textbook, I want to mark this point

180
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,280
as the end of me sharing facts about dark matter, and the beginning of me sharing theories about

181
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,960
dark matter. There's a difference, and it will make more sense as we go. Would it be a mixing

182
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,640
metaphor as if I said we're now crossing the event horizon? Whatever, I'm a physicist,

183
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,440
not a poet. So the prevailing explanation for why these two curves look different is because

184
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,400
there's some invisible stuff in galaxies. And if this were to be the case, there are two things

185
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,440
we could confidently say about it. First, that it doesn't interact electromagnetically. It doesn't

186
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,880
emit light, or absorb light, or reflect light, and is therefore completely undetectable in images

187
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,520
that rely on light coming from an object. Or according to some theories, it doesn't interact

188
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:56,640
electromagnetically much. Hence, dark. And second, it does interact gravitationally. Because it's

189
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:02,800
causing these gravitational effects on orbits, it must have mass, which means it must be some kind

190
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:10,800
of matter. Thus, dark matter. Stuff with mass that we cannot see. Hard to see stuff. And that's a fine

191
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:16,160
idea. But there's kind of a big hole in it, and that's that we don't have any real idea of what

192
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,840
it actually is. There are a ton of different models for what dark matter is, but none of them explain

193
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:27,680
the observations completely. Some theories model dark matter as a kind of particle, like axions,

194
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:34,160
or gravatinos, or what somebody very cleverly named, weakly interacting massive particles.

195
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,280
Feels like projection. Presumably playing off that pun, somebody proposed a theory for dark matter

196
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:44,800
in which it was made of large, dark objects like black holes or brown dwarfs. Instead of a fluid

197
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,360
of particles naming them massive, compact, halo objects. So at one point, the competing theories

198
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,720
for dark matter were wimps and machos. This is an astronomer's idea of a good joke, by the way.

199
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,600
This is astronomy culture. And it's not like a nickname or something. The title of the paper

200
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,800
I published once has the word macho in it twice because of the name of the events I'm analyzing.

201
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,280
I was looking for black holes and the data I used to identify them came from the macho project,

202
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,680
because black holes could maybe be a kind of macho. So the maybe black holes from my thesis

203
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,240
are named things like macho 96 bulge 5. I always had more hope in that one. I was never convinced

204
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,000
by macho 98 bulge 6. At 100,000 subscribers, I'll do a video about my old astrophysics research.

205
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,440
So if you want to hear more about this overdone tangent, smash that subscribe button. I hate myself

206
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,600
when I do this sometimes. Sorry, the pun thing really got me going. So some people think dark

207
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,560
matter is an invisible particle. Some people think it's big dark things. Some people think it's a

208
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,600
fifth dimension that somehow makes everything make sense. There are theories of cold dark matter

209
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:51,040
and hot dark matter and even warm dark matter. My personal favorite theory is that of primordial

210
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,840
black holes, which are like teeny tiny little black holes that formed right after the Big Bang,

211
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,960
because I think it's cute. The Uwu theory of dark matter, if you will. This must be what Contra

212
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,800
points felt like when she said Squidwardian. Are we really saying that's word out loud? To an

213
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,760
audience of millions? Okay. But here's the problem. None of these theories of dark matter on their

214
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,800
own can explain all our observations. Like I said earlier, there are other kinds of observations

215
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,680
besides the rotation curves of galaxies that point to some undetectable mass of an unknown

216
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,040
nature. And different models of what dark matter actually is are better able to explain the different

217
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:30,960
observations. This vulcanization of theories is not dissimilar from the story of luminiferous ether,

218
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,000
which 19th century physicists used to explain how light traveled through empty space. Just like

219
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,040
with dark matter, some effectively invisible material was predicted in order to explain

220
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,920
unexpected experimental results. And the models fractured further and further until everybody

221
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,160
had an ether theory to match their favorite observation. And just like with ether, some

222
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,280
scholars have called this multiplicity of models a crisis for the dark matter community, contrasting

223
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,760
the minimal evidence of any one model with the massive amounts of effort that have gone to

224
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,000
experimentally testing them. Dark matter is one of those particles that for decades physicists

225
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,640
have been saying they're going to find it in the next 10 years. And haven't. We just need to build

226
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,280
a particle collider the size of Earth's orbit. Then we'll find it. Given everything I've learned

227
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,080
about dark matter, I'm inclined to agree with astrophysicists more to hide Milgram's take on the

228
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:25,280
search. If one does not presuppose anything about what dark matter is, about what its interactions

229
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:32,240
with baryons and with itself are, besides gravity, and about how it got to where it is,

230
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,040
then it is hard to rule out. My God, the shade. He's kind of right, though. It is pretty hard to

231
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,040
rule out a theory when you have no evidence. And you might be thinking, but what about those

232
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,320
rotation curves? We learned a whole graph for it. Isn't that evidence of something? Well, it could be.

233
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,480
Or we could just be wrong about gravity again.

234
00:20:50,880 --> 00:21:02,400
Remember earlier when I said that Mercury had a weird orbit and that in order to explain it,

235
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,040
astronomers predicted there might be another planet closer into the sun? So even though this was

236
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,040
wrong, there was good context for it. French mathematician and astronomer,

237
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:17,280
Urban Leverrier, Urban Leverrier, Urbane Leverrier, whatever his name was, the guy who identified

238
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,800
Mercury's weird orbit had actually predicted the existence of Neptune just a few years earlier

239
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:28,320
based on weirdness in Uranus's orbit. He used Newtonian gravity to analyze the orbit of Uranus

240
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,560
and found it to be slightly off from what the observers were measuring, so he deduced that

241
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,920
there must be another planet there that nobody had seen yet, causing these gravitational perturbations.

242
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,880
And there was. He sent his calculations to an observer who identified Neptune literally that

243
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,920
same evening. Truly a testament of Newtonian mechanics' predictive power. So when he found

244
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,440
similar gravitational anomalies in Mercury's orbit, he theorized that there may be, once again,

245
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,680
an unidentified planet to blame. And since he was so successful last time he did that,

246
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,320
the community went all in. The search began, sub-theories proliferated, and they even gave

247
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,520
the putative planet a name, Vulcan. There's a weirdly high rate of almost having things called

248
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,080
Vulcan in astronomy. Some of it precedes Star Trek. But as we know today, there is no planet

249
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,240
Vulcan. And it wasn't until a century later that Einstein's theories of relativity came

250
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,160
along to explain why. Newtonian gravity just wasn't adequate to predict an orbit as close

251
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,800
into the Sun's gravitational influence as Mercury. I share this example of planet predictions

252
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:32,320
because it illustrates two diverging responses to failed experiments. You make a prediction,

253
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,240
you take a measurement, your prediction doesn't match your measurements. What do you do? Well,

254
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,280
when it came to Uranus, the answer was to imagine what other stuff might be affecting the data and

255
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,000
then look for that stuff. And sometimes that works. But when it came to Mercury, it wasn't that there

256
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
was unaccounted for stuff. It was that the theory the predictions were based on was inadequate.

257
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,200
Do you see where I'm going with this? On the whole, the astronomy community in the last century-ish

258
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,200
has determined that in order to resolve the difference between what we see and what we

259
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,880
predict in galaxies, there must be some stuff out there that we're not seeing. Neptune must exist,

260
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,520
so to speak. But what if dark matter isn't like Neptune? What if it's like Mercury? What if the

261
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,960
assumptions we use to make this were just wrong? Well, that guy Milgram, who's brutal dressing

262
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,680
down of the search for dark matter, I just quoted, kind of developed a whole theory for this. It's

263
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:28,160
called Modified Newtonian Dynamics, or MOND, and it's an alternate explanation for the dark matter

264
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,800
observations that makes adjustments to our understanding of gravity instead of inventing

265
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,280
invisible ether stuff. Milgram published his first paper on MOND in 1983, 50 years after the term

266
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,000
dark matter was coined by Fritz Zwicky. And while, as I'll get to in a minute, it's not exactly a

267
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,520
popular theory, it is legitimate insofar as there are hundreds of peer-reviewed papers on it. It's

268
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,440
fringe, but it's decidedly not in crackpot territory. Now, I'm not going to get into the

269
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,800
mathematics here, mostly because I refuse to ever show an equation on this channel on principle,

270
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:04,800
but in the same way that Einstein's relativity usurped Newtonian mechanics because it was more

271
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:11,040
broadly applicable in the situations of extremely high speed or gravity, MOND proposes additions

272
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,920
that also account for very low accelerations, which becomes more relevant when you're considering

273
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,240
things on the size scale of galaxies, for example. If you want all the math, you can go read the

274
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,160
papers yourself. My references are in the description. I feel like when my old college

275
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:29,040
professors would like introduce an idea and be like, and you can go home and do the derivation

276
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:34,640
for fun if you want. And it's like, what nerds actually did that? I did that. The important

277
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,960
thing is that by making tweaks to our current understanding of gravity, we would be able to

278
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,520
make predictions for the rotation curves of galaxies that match our observations better.

279
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,600
But like previous changes to gravity, MOND doesn't negate what came before it so much as add to it.

280
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,480
MOND makes gravity predictable in a wider range of situations, and there's actually

281
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,520
decently compelling evidence for MOND. Unlike most models of dark matter, people have actually used

282
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:05,280
it to make successful predictions in advance of seeing data instead of adapting to data after

283
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,880
the fact, which you would think would be an important quality to consider when evaluating

284
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,280
competing theories, but as we'll get to later, not the most important. And to be clear, I'm not

285
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,080
going to sit here and pretend that MOND is definitely the more correct hypothesis. I think the strongest

286
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,560
argument against it is that it can't account for everything. In particular, it's not very good at

287
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,760
explaining the cosmological scale dark matter observations that I didn't get into because

288
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,520
this video needs some bounds. But when it comes to galaxy scale observations like our rotation curves,

289
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,720
papers published as recently as last year argue that MOND actually works better than any one model

290
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,120
of dark matter. I should also mention that there are more theories of modified gravity than just

291
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,280
MOND, and some of them do a better job with the cosmology stuff. Kind of similar to how there

292
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,160
are many models of dark matter that each do better or worse at explaining different pieces of evidence.

293
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,320
I'll just say MOND for the rest of the video, but know that I'm using it as a shorthand to

294
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,320
refer to the multiplicity of models that solve dark matter by updating gravity rather than

295
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,800
inventing space ether. But as interesting as this theory is, the field doesn't really like it. As in,

296
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,720
and forgive me for generalizing, but most astronomers do not take MOND seriously as an

297
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:21,040
option for explaining dark matter. Anecdotally, I can say that in my 10 years studying astrophysics,

298
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,640
I had only ever heard MOND referred to once in earnest, and any other time I had heard anybody

299
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,000
mention it, it's been as a joke. Like, look at those kooky MOND researchers who think they're

300
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:40,160
gonna solve gravity. So silly. Who's even funding them? MOND is like astronomy's embarrassing cousin

301
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:46,240
that gets lumped in with ET research and is like in the space of technically legitimate but

302
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,040
effectively crackpotty? Actually, that's not true. People respect SETI. I'm gonna go out on a limb

303
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,480
and say most astronomers take them more seriously than they do the MOND people. But beyond my own

304
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,960
personal experience, you just have to look at an astronomy textbook to see the institutional

305
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,960
erasure of MOND as a viable solution for dark matter. Here's what my first astro textbook

306
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,560
says about dark matter. To explain these nearly uniform orbital speeds in the outer parts of the

307
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:19,280
galaxy, astronomers conclude that a large amount of matter must lie outside the sun's orbit.

308
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,160
This unseen material, which is by far the predominant constituent of our galaxy,

309
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:32,080
is called dark matter. Not astronomers hypothesize. Not astronomers are evaluating. Astronomers

310
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:38,960
conclude there is unseen material and is called dark matter. I looked through all of my old textbooks

311
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,440
that I had lying around and all of them had sections on, you know, dark matter that described

312
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:52,000
machos and wimps and axions and all that stuff, but literally no mention of the possibility of

313
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
other formulations of gravity. Curious. Finally, we can compare the distribution of papers published

314
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,840
on each topic. Doing a quick search on NASA ADS, which is the place to search for astrophysics

315
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:10,000
articles, we get nearly 80,000 hits for papers with the keywords dark matter and only 1,600

316
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,040
with the keyword MOND. That's a difference of nearly two orders of magnitude. That's huge.

317
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:21,040
I bring all this up. MOND's complete absence from textbooks, the relative lack of research

318
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:26,000
conducted on it and the way it's literally treated as a joke by people I know. To support the claim

319
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,200
that as a community, the field of astrophysics has made a choice. And I'm not saying that the

320
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,920
Council of Astronomers who demoted Pluto got together again to suppress MOND. I'm saying that

321
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:41,680
we hit this phenomenological fork in the road, the dark matter observations, and we had the options

322
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:48,320
of inventing something or adjusting our models. And despite what I see as a good amount of compelling

323
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,080
but non-conclusive evidence supporting the validity of either option, the field has very clearly

324
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,040
made a decision. And this is really interesting to me because it is such a good example of the

325
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,360
problem in thinking that science is some linear march towards objective truth where we get closer

326
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:12,480
and closer to the end by using our manly emotionless rationality. That attitude towards science lacks

327
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,160
the complexity of making choices. Like a great philosopher once said, everybody got choices.

328
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,960
Even scientists got choices. Is that a particle we didn't see? Take another shot of modified

329
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,320
gravity? That was a pretty deep cut, but I couldn't not. And I cannot stress this enough.

330
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:34,720
Those choices are not a failure of the scientific method. In fact, they're necessary for the pursuit

331
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,160
of science to go anywhere at all. Wow, what a cliffhanger. I don't know about you, but I'm excited

332
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,840
to see where this is going. But before we get to that, I got to do my least favorite part of the

333
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,560
video. The part where I give you the uncomfortable choice of paying for the content you're watching

334
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:53,600
or not. See, I have this kind of idealistic belief that if I make something good and put it out into

335
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,640
the world, then enough people will volunteer to pay me for it that I can keep it free for everybody

336
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,680
who can't and not have to succumb to the various sponsor requests in my inbox. Because wouldn't

337
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,440
it be cool if I could get paid for my work without trying to sell my viewers something they probably

338
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,200
don't want or need? I think so. But I do understand it's a choice. Some reasons one might choose not

339
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,000
to support me on Patreon are because they can't afford $3 a month, because they don't think the

340
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,960
videos I make are worth that, or because they're three raccoons in a trenchcoat and don't understand

341
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,480
the idea of compensation. I know my sincerity reads a sarcasm sometimes, but I really do sympathize

342
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,720
with all those reasons. Especially the raccoon one, you would have no idea what's going on.

343
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,080
But some reasons one might choose to subscribe to my Patreon are to watch exclusive videos,

344
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,440
where I answer questions patrons ask me or interview other creators, get access to the

345
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,440
ad-free versions of my video essays, and help me pay my bills while still making this YouTube stuff.

346
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,920
Both choices are valid, and while they're certainly one that I'd prefer, I do understand

347
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,840
that there can be good reasons either way. So to those already supporting me on Patreon,

348
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,880
thank you. You're amazing. To those who already know they won't, that's fine. I'm still glad

349
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,000
you're here. And to those considering it, you are the population who will determine how long I

350
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,720
can keep doing this. No pressure. Just trying to help you make informed decisions. Okay, that's enough

351
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,160
discussion of like personal finance choices. Let's get back to the fun stuff. Science choices.

352
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,600
So I know a lot of people think that science is just the straightforward application of the

353
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:38,400
scientific method, and that's very cute. The fact that this is only kind of sometimes what the process

354
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,440
of scientific research looks like is a huge topic that I will probably make a whole video about

355
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,800
whenever I get around to reading against method. But today, I want to draw our attention to that

356
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:54,800
ineffable initiation of inquiry, the hypothesis. The formulation of a hypothesis has been called

357
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,520
the most mysterious step of the scientific method, because it's kind of hard to explain

358
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,960
exactly where a hypothesis comes from, how a hypothesis is constructed, if you will. The

359
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,240
choice of a hypothesis is so crucial to the whole scientific process, because what you choose to

360
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,680
study determines what you're gonna find out. This is especially important when you have multiple

361
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,720
or conflicting hypotheses. How do you decide which one to point the scientific method at?

362
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,400
One might naively think, well, just systematically test all the hypotheses in whichever is the most

363
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,440
successful determines where your theory goes. So objective. But the inherent futility of this

364
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,800
strategy is exactly what drove philosopher Robert Piercig, who was a university biochemistry student

365
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:42,720
at the age of only 15, to abandon science entirely after only a few years of research. While doing

366
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:48,800
laboratory work, he became obsessed with the idea of hypotheses in and of themselves, and in particular,

367
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:54,320
their tendency to multiply. As you test one hypothesis, he realized, many more hypotheses will

368
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,880
come to mind. And then when you go to test the first of those, you would get hit by yet another

369
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,560
flood of hypotheses. The more science you do, the more untested hypotheses you have. At first,

370
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:09,360
he thought this was amusing and came up with like a jokie law saying that the number of rational

371
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:15,840
hypotheses that can explain any given phenomenon is infinite. But over time, his amusement transformed

372
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:22,240
into a deep nihilism about scientific reasoning and its potential to lead humans to true knowledge

373
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,440
of nature. If the purpose of the scientific method is to select from among a multitude of

374
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,440
hypotheses, and if the number of hypotheses grows faster than experimental method can handle,

375
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,520
then it is clear that all hypotheses can never be tested. If all hypotheses cannot be tested,

376
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:45,120
then the results of any experiment are inconclusive, and the entire scientific method falls short of

377
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,200
its goal of establishing proven knowledge. Establishing proven knowledge. How much you

378
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,560
want to bet Piercig was one of those science students who picked the subject because of how

379
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,040
much he likes that there's only one single definite answer to each question. I say that

380
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,440
like I wasn't also that student at one point. I thought I was so clever just choosing to learn

381
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:10,240
absolute truths about the universe. For Piercig, this realization of infinite hypotheses along

382
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,680
with the lack of rational tools to choose between them was catastrophic for his ability to do science.

383
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,480
And I guess because he couldn't reconcile these complications with what I'm assuming was his starting

384
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,640
point of dogmatic scientific rationalism and objective truth-seeking, he dropped out of university

385
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:31,120
just a few years later. But others have realized these complicating aspects of science without

386
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:36,800
having existential crises. For example, in The Island of Knowledge, The Limits of Science and

387
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,400
the Search for Meaning, Brazilian astrophysicist Marcelo Gleiser uses a metaphor of an island

388
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,920
to describe how increasing knowledge actually takes us further from a final truth.

389
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:53,040
As The Island of Knowledge grows, so do the shores of our ignorance, the boundary between

390
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,160
the known and unknown. Learning more about the world doesn't lead to a point closer to a final

391
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:04,080
destination, whose existence is nothing but a hopeful assumption anyways, but to more questions

392
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,920
and mysteries. According to Gleiser, Piercig's problem of infinite hypotheses wasn't a flaw

393
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,680
of the scientific method so much as a fundamental feature of human's knowledge acquisition. By

394
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:21,520
seeking more and more information, we're not converging on truth, but fractaling out into

395
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,920
complexity. The more you know, the more you know you don't know.

396
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,040
So if trying to answer questions leads to more questions, and if we only have finite time and

397
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:45,280
resources to attempt answering some questions, then we still need to figure out how do we choose

398
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,160
which hypotheses to pursue. Well, we've talked about Einstein's sum in this video and he seems

399
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,720
to have landed on some pretty good theories, so what did he think about how we should find our

400
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:01,120
way to the best truths? The supreme task is to arrive at those universal elementary laws,

401
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:06,240
from which the cosmos can be built up by pure deduction. There is no logical path to these

402
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:12,960
laws. Only intuition, resting on sympathetic understanding of experience, can reach them.

403
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,800
Intuition? Sympathetic understanding? What do you think all the Einstein fanboys would think if

404
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,920
they knew their physics god believed that feelings are how we solve the universe? Einstein's not

405
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,320
the only one who says this, by the way. In his writings on how theories are modified over time,

406
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,200
the French physicist and philosopher Pierre Duem suggests that scientists have to follow their

407
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,880
good sense. And this was directly in response to the philosophical question of how to decide

408
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,400
if a challenged theory should change in its foundational premises or the surrounding assumptions.

409
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,840
In other words, the exact kind of fork in the road we see with dark matter and

410
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,320
bond. Do we go back and revise or do we press on and add more? At the present moment,

411
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,160
I don't think we have enough evidence in either direction to know for sure, but as I've already

412
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,240
argued, a decision has been made. And while I agree with Einstein and Duem's ideas of some kind of

413
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,360
intellectual intuition that guides us through the inherently open-ended parts of the scientific

414
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:12,640
method, and unlike Piercig, I believe that it's fine for this to be how science works and not

415
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,320
evidence of its failure, I think there's an important difference between an individual scientist

416
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:25,520
going off vibes and a collection of scientists going off vibes in a patterned way. Or there would

417
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,200
be if there was actually such a thing as an individual scientist. You see, despite their aura of pure

418
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,720
objectivity, scientists also live in a society.

419
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,880
So now that we have some context, I want to come back to this question of what does it mean for

420
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,520
science to be socially constructed. Like I said at the top of this video, today I'm interested

421
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,720
in the mid-strength constructivist regime that claims the substance of scientific theories can

422
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,200
be influenced by social factors. And I have a really good example of this that is not at all

423
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,240
related to astrophysics. Science historian Everett Mendelssohn has done some really fascinating work

424
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:13,120
analyzing the socio-political forces that led to a reductionist approach to biology in 1840s Germany,

425
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:18,160
a time and place characterized by significant political unrest, emerging revolutionary movements,

426
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,480
and an anti-autocratic energy among the youths. Mendelssohn argued that this particular social

427
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,000
milieu, the same one that produced a young Karl Marx in fact, resulted in a young,

428
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,960
alienated intellectual group that sought to create counter concepts. Whether through science or

429
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,880
politics, they wanted to challenge the old order and their explanations for the world. Reductionism,

430
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,280
the idea that you can best understand things by breaking them down to their fundamental pieces,

431
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,160
was at the time considered controversial and revolutionary and therefore was in line with

432
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,520
the counter-cultural moment. And that's cool, I guess. The interesting part is that at the exact

433
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,440
same time, biologists in France were having their own scientific revolution, except their shift was

434
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:08,800
towards a holistic, organismic paradigm of biology, which is the antithetical approach to reductionism,

435
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,440
their opposites. Or at least they were opposite at the time. Apparently modern biology has made

436
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,280
some advances towards synthesizing the two approaches, which is cool. Good for them.

437
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,200
Shout out to the biologists who read the script for me. Of the stark difference between French

438
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,600
and German biological paradigms, Mendelssohn says, The very existence of such a marked difference

439
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:33,680
almost demands a parallel investigation of the mix of cognitive, institutional, and social factors

440
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,840
west of the Rhine. You'll have to read his papers for a more detailed explanation of what

441
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:43,040
those factors were, but the important thing here is that differences in the social, political,

442
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:50,000
or institutional contexts led to differences in the approach to formulating scientific theories.

443
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,080
The dark matter, Mend's split, is to an extent an analogous situation. Two antithetical paradigms

444
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,480
for solving a science problem. But the dichotomy is less visible because of what I think is the

445
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,920
monopolizing tendency of American research. Interestingly, more of the top-sided Mend research

446
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,960
comes from outside of the US as opposed to the top-sided dark matter research, so maybe the split

447
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,880
here isn't as clear as Germany versus France, and it's more like the United States research

448
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,400
industrial complex versus a small population of random foreign scientists. I'm not sure about

449
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,360
that detail, but the point is, different contexts leads to different science. And I'm going to get

450
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:31,520
to my theory on the context that produced the dark matter choice, but first, I want to touch on why

451
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:36,560
this kind of analysis matters at all. Because the social constructedness of science doesn't just

452
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,880
dictate how science happens, it also determines how it will interact with the rest of society.

453
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:49,200
For example, via policy, education, or public communication. There are so many situations

454
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,000
where the subjective decision-making necessary to do science has been socially influenced in

455
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,440
negative ways. The choice of how much effort to invest in researching a cure for AIDS in the 80s.

456
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,760
Or the existence of completely legitimate scientific research that exists solely to sell

457
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,080
particular food products. Or the kinds of algorithms and software that venture capital

458
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,560
is investing in right now. Or the decision to launch the space shuttle challenger when they did.

459
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,480
That one's actually really interesting. There's a whole argument that the particular ways in

460
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,280
which people were visualizing data in order to communicate to project leadership is why

461
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,760
what happened happened. And, you know, data visualization is definitely a subjective choice.

462
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,000
I should do a video on that. Comment below if you want a video on data visualization.

463
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,720
None of these are just outcomes of the straight logical path towards linear progress.

464
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,320
They're choices that are influenced by and subsequently influence politics. And like,

465
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,080
please don't reduce this to me saying that science is just a political tool.

466
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:52,480
Science can be used to many ends, and a lot of them are good, but, dare I say, some of them,

467
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,600
sometimes are bad. Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?

468
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:03,120
And I'm not saying the way to avoid doing socially bad science is to remove the subjectivity.

469
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,720
Frankly, I don't think that's possible. I think the more productive takeaway is the

470
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,560
need for transparency and self-awareness in those choices so they can be as well-informed as possible.

471
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,760
In a 1996 paper titled, Is Science Socially Constructed? And Can It Still Inform Public

472
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,040
Policy? Scholar of Science and Technology Studies Sheila Jasenoff answers both questions with a

473
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,320
resounding and well-justified yes, emphasizing the importance of being aware of this multiplicity

474
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:34,000
of paths scientists can take. As one probes more deeply into the causes of policy-relevant

475
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,320
controversies, one finds that science's inability to answer questions is rarely the most pressing

476
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:46,000
problem. People are often convinced that they have the right scientific answer. Constructivist

477
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,600
analysis, which seeks even handedly to explain variations in beliefs about the world,

478
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:57,600
discovers in many such instances that disagreements about the right way to answer the quote-unquote

479
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:03,360
same question reflected deeper disagreements about what the disagreement really is.

480
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:08,240
So in order to get the maximum benefit of using science to inform any kind of public policy,

481
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:15,600
we have to be able to do the meta-analysis of which questions should we be asking to science.

482
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:20,080
And that is outside the purview of the scientific method. It's a skill set,

483
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,720
nuclear physicist Alvin Weinberg called trans-science. Understanding science

484
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,000
as social constructiveness is also really important in education. In the US, physics education,

485
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,720
especially at the earlier levels, frames learning science as collecting facts and tools that will

486
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:42,800
lead one to uncovering objective truths. What isn't often taught is the cognitive flexibility

487
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:49,120
required to make the judgment calls necessary to doing science. Remember Piercig? If he'd had a more

488
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,480
epistemologically mature understanding of what the point of science even is, he probably wouldn't

489
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,880
have had a crisis of faith that made him leave the field when he realized you can't be completely

490
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,520
rational about all of it all of the time. If your goal doing science is to find objective truth through

491
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,040
purely rational pathways, you're gonna get stuck the fuck up when you realize you can't find the

492
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,000
one true path. Or I guess you can convince yourself that you found it and then everybody around you

493
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,480
has to deal with your god complex. A complaint I hear all the time from research mentors and

494
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,560
advisors is that their students don't know how to take initiative over their work. Like they're

495
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,520
basically just obedient little robots who can do any analysis you instruct them to but really

496
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,240
struggle to come up with their own ideas. I think that struggle comes at least partially from

497
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:40,800
students' lack of belief in their own subjective reasoning skills and intuitive curiosity

498
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,520
because we never teach them how to make imperfect decisions. I don't think we even

499
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,280
tell them making imperfect decisions is okay, let alone necessary. For a more detailed discussion

500
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,080
on the gap between physics students learned perfectionism and the decidedly non-perfectionist

501
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,960
thinking necessary to do science, check out this article called Leaving the One True Path,

502
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,000
Teaching Physics Without Single Correct Answers, where MyLen DePenta talks about their experience

503
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,600
helping students unlearn rigid single solution thinking. Students often accepted the idea that

504
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:16,560
historical models were imperfect but assumed that the goal of science was to find the single

505
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:22,960
correct model. But there are no quote-unquote completely right answers. The finite number

506
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,960
of acceptable solutions all have their downsides so the skill of using them isn't in memorizing

507
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,520
or even deriving but in discerning which situations a model is well suited to. This helps students

508
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:41,680
reject objectivity without rejecting accountability. And it's not just future scientists who have to

509
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:47,120
have this knowledge flexibility. A lot of arguments against things like climate change or vaccine

510
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:53,440
efficacy stem from, well, the science changed so the science must be wrong. Maybe if we did a better

511
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,960
job of teaching people what science actually is and how we make it, they wouldn't be recreating

512
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,440
Pearson's very rational breakdown every time they're confronted with updated information.

513
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,680
Scientific literacy is a thing and it's more than just memorizing some fun facts or knowing

514
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,880
how to manipulate equations. And on that note, the social constructiveness of science plays a huge

515
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,000
part in determining what the public believes. An example of this I really like is the recent

516
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,000
scientific validation of millennia old practices in eastern medicine and spirituality like yoga

517
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,880
or acupuncture. Today there is peer-reviewed research proving the efficacy of these practices

518
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,560
to the point that they're sometimes prescribed by doctors or covered by insurance.

519
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:36,560
But while pointing scientific tools at these ancient methods didn't all of a sudden make

520
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:42,160
them work better, it did make it so that large swaths of the population who would have dismissed

521
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,840
them before as mystic bullshit would now take them seriously. They believe it because science said

522
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:52,640
it was true. Science made it true for them, even though it had already been true for a lot of people

523
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:58,240
for a long time. Similarly, at least to the extent that you probably have heard of dark matter and

524
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:04,720
you probably haven't heard of Monde, your scientific knowledge of gravity has been socially constructed.

525
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,840
Because while the physicists in my comment section are currently typing,

526
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:13,120
well duh, scientists know that we're dealing with imperfect models and gravity is obviously

527
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:17,440
incomplete. Who doesn't know that? The public doesn't always know that and they can only work

528
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:23,200
with what we give them. So via what I feel safe to assess is the common belief that dark matter

529
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:29,280
exists and gravity is just facts. Scientific knowledge is socially constructed. The way

530
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,440
scientists do the science has space for variation while still being science. But the reasons for

531
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,400
that variation are not because of the science, they're because of the science's context.

532
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:46,240
If you buy that whole German-French biology analysis, things like political climate and

533
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:52,160
social milieu can influence the direction scientists pursue the infinite hypotheses

534
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,840
available to them. And like I keep saying, the field of astrophysics has largely made a choice

535
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:02,000
when it comes to dark matter. The logical conclusion I'm coming to is that there must

536
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,720
be some contextual reason for us choosing dark matter, which begs the question...

537
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,800
Okay, so this is the highly speculative and squishy part of the video where I share

538
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,600
the broader trends that, at least in my mind, seem aligned with the hard lean towards explaining

539
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:32,800
the dark matter observations with space ether instead of more complicated gravity. I have

540
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,320
one pitch for a purely socio-political factor because that's what this video is about. But I

541
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,560
would be remiss if I didn't mention the institutional factors that are at play as well.

542
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:48,880
TLDR, academic publishing in the United States, is literally just a business that motivates researchers

543
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,560
to heavily invest in whatever is already being heavily invested in.

544
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:57,120
This isn't something specific to Mond and dark matter, by the way. This is just saying that

545
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:02,160
if there's some small difference in people's interest in the two theories, the financial

546
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:08,480
incentives of publishing would exacerbate and solidify that difference such that there is an

547
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,920
obvious choice of which one you should study if you want a job. The Matthew Effect, a principle

548
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,960
that says that a small advantage early on will snowball into a large advantage later on,

549
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:24,080
has been measured in all aspects of publishing from journal impact to institutional ranking

550
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:30,240
and even individual careers. And papers on novel research are actually biased against in journals

551
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:36,000
even though they're more likely to become a top 1% most cited paper in the long term.

552
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,800
Basically, financial incentives deter people from rocking the boat even though boat rocking is

553
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,000
fundamentally necessary to progress science. But that's enough publishing and bibliometrics talk.

554
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,960
If you want to hear more about it, go watch this other video that I made.

555
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,840
My point here is that if there's enough of a reason to push scientists towards one direction

556
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:59,760
even a little bit, then institutional incentives would solidify and exacerbate that choice.

557
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,240
But this still begs the question, why the initial push towards dark matter?

558
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,920
What were the post-big bang in homogeneities that led to the large-scale structure of the universe?

559
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,000
Is a metaphor useful if you need an upper division cosmology course to understand it?

560
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,560
I don't know, this joke's almost as obscure as the E41.

561
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,720
What am I doing? Okay, here's my pitch.

562
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:24,160
I think the collective subjective choice of choosing invisible stuff as an explanation

563
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:29,840
for dark matter is consistent with physics' cultural value of simplicity.

564
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:34,720
And if you don't think physics has a culture, congratulations, you're thinking like a physicist.

565
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:41,280
Because believing that physicists have no culture is a well-documented part of physics' culture.

566
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,760
But yeah, the physics community, at least in post-enlightenment western science,

567
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:52,880
highly values solutions that are beautiful or elegant, like some kind of horny Occam's razor

568
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,840
that prioritizes solutions so simple they require feminizing for some reason.

569
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:01,760
Occam's razor, by the way, also called the principle of parsimony sometimes,

570
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,640
is the idea that the solution that makes the fewest assumptions is usually the best solution.

571
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,000
But as much as Occam's razor can be a helpful rule of thumb that prevents

572
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,040
nerds like Piercig from having a complete mental breakdown,

573
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,480
there is no rule that the universe has to be straightforward.

574
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,120
A messy solution can in fact be more useful than a clean one, an elegant one.

575
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:27,280
A really great example of simplicity as a driving value for physics is the search for a theory of

576
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:34,800
everything. Hypothetically, a theory of knowledge would explain all aspects of the universe fully

577
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:41,920
in one neat set of equations. Or ideally, one equation. Historically, we have had success

578
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,760
with some kinds of unified theories. For example, Maxwell unified our theories of electricity and

579
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:54,080
magnetism into electromagnetism. But a unified theory of everything that combines the electromagnetic

580
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:58,400
force with the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force and even gravity?

581
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,080
That's our holy grail. And I'll grant we've come kind of close.

582
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:06,960
There are fairly solid models for a grand unified theory that explain all the forces except for

583
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,360
gravity. A whole bunch of famous theories exist to make gravity play nice with the other forces.

584
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,200
This is what string theory is trying to do, this is what m-theory is trying to do,

585
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,320
this is what loop quantum gravity is trying to do, but no one's quite gotten it to work.

586
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,800
Honestly, gravity's just really hard to pin down in general. Like we can predict what it does

587
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:32,800
in some context, but we have absolutely no idea why. So the search for theories of everything

588
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,240
is illustrative of modern physics' tendency towards simplification. And I think astronomy's

589
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,760
attempt to explain the dark matter observations with space ether instead of further revisions to

590
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:49,520
gravity is consistent with a broader desire to reduce everything to a few simple rules.

591
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,600
Because we like for things to be simple. No more than that, we expect them to be.

592
00:52:53,600 --> 00:53:00,000
So we often study them as if they are. And I'm not trying to say this tendency is purely monkey

593
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,640
brain's vibes based. The principle of parsimony is useful in a lot of contexts, and there are

594
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:09,440
perfectly valid statistical and philosophical arguments for not rejecting it outright. And it

595
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:15,360
is objectively a cool thing when you can explain multiple different problems with a single solution.

596
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:20,000
And it's awesome that that is sometimes the solution that works best. But I don't think

597
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,880
it's unreasonable to say that the assumption of simplicity can affect what scientists choose to

598
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:30,720
study and how they choose to study it. Not necessarily in bad ways, but in ways that limit

599
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:36,000
the knowledge we generate. In a second here, I'm going to wax philosophical on why physicists want

600
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,400
everything to be simple. But first, I want to pose this video's discussion prompt for the comment

601
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,720
section. If you're new here, I've been ending my videos with a question for the viewer at home

602
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,200
to answer in the comments. And in the end of the next video, I'll share some of the answers I get

603
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:54,400
from this video, prioritizing commenters who also comment on other people's comments,

604
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:00,640
because that's how we make this a conversation. Today's question is, what are other examples

605
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:06,480
of cultural values influencing the creation of knowledge in whatever field, discipline,

606
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,840
or area of expertise you have experience in? What's a subjective principle you've seen

607
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:17,120
affect how people explain things or even what things people choose to explain? And it doesn't

608
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:22,560
have to be in academia, knowledge creation happens in lots of contexts and values are always involved.

609
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,080
I know my viewers always come through with super interesting answers, so I'm really excited to

610
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,840
see what we get with this one. So I hope you'll take a moment to share your unique perspective

611
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,600
with me and the rest of the audience and check out other people's perspectives too,

612
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,480
so you don't just have to trust mine. Did you do it? Great, thanks. So why do physicists want

613
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,560
everything to be simple? I think the most compelling reason I've heard for this actually

614
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:46,720
comes from an argument against grand unified theories, so it's a good thing that you already

615
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,040
know what those are. That astrophysicist Glycer that I mentioned earlier who wrote Island of

616
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,520
Knowledge also wrote a really interesting contribution to a book of essays called This Idea

617
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:00,720
Must Die, Scientific Theories That Are Blocking Progress, which is a super fun read by the way.

618
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:05,280
In his essay, he points out some of the shortcomings of existing unification theories,

619
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,720
argues that the idea is nice but ultimately kind of naive,

620
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,120
and proposes what he sees as an explanation for said naivete.

621
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:19,760
The scientific impulse to unify is crypto-religious. The West has bathed in monotheism for thousands

622
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:25,280
of years, and even in polytheistic cultures, there's always an Alpha God in charge. There's

623
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:31,280
something deeply appealing in equating all of nature to a single creative principle. To decipher

624
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,680
the mind of God is to be special, is to answer a higher calling.

625
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:39,360
Okay, I know there's going to be people who have been with me this whole time whose brains just like

626
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,840
shut off when they heard the word God. If it makes you feel better, Stephen Hawking,

627
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:48,720
who was a very rational guy whose biopic was literally titled The Theory of Everything,

628
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:54,560
initially believed in such theories but eventually abandoned it as well. But back to the God stuff.

629
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,960
Despite the common belief that science and religion are opposite things that don't have

630
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,960
anything to do with each other, there is a strong historical record that indicates that

631
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,520
Enlightenment science was influenced by the cultural dominance of the church in Europe,

632
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:13,200
and a particular puritanism that was the predecessor for modern physics' weird secular

633
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:19,040
asceticism in the name of a god of rationality. Again, this one point will probably be a whole

634
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:24,000
hour long video eventually. But for now, let's just say that the intermingling of science and

635
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,280
religious thought, including western science and Christianity, is a well-documented part of

636
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:34,080
its history. And I'm not trying to overstate the chain of causality here because social evolution

637
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:39,840
is not so easily reducible. But the Abrahamic holdover of a single point of origin for all

638
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:46,720
things just makes a lot of sense to me as the reason physicists tend towards a simple solution

639
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:52,800
even in the face of a messy reality. It really feels like this desire to reduce the universe

640
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:59,360
to a base set of equations is just repackaged monism with some scientific flavor. We want to

641
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:04,240
make physics simple because deep down we know that we're all one, man. Damn, is that really

642
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,400
where this video is landing? We made up dark matter because scientists want to believe in God,

643
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,240
I guess so. Told you we'd get there.

644
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,160
What a journey this has been. Unless this video convinced anyone that I'm not a serious

645
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:26,640
scientist, I should clarify I'm not some diehard Mont supporter who thinks that dark matter

646
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:31,920
definitely can't exist. I'm more just trying to make a point that sometimes scientists pedestal

647
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,720
certain theories because of subjective values. I don't know what's definitely true, I'm just

648
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:41,920
trying to see what I can glean from the situation by keeping an open mind. And like, who knows,

649
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,320
maybe they're both right. If the biggest problem with either solution is that neither can explain

650
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:51,840
all of the dark matter observations, then maybe there's some combo solution in which both things

651
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:57,280
are contributing to what we see. Real talk, though, it barely matters which of these theories is right

652
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:03,440
because it's astrophysics. The stakes are literally just ego. The thing that matters is that if we

653
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:09,040
don't pay attention to how we construct scientific knowledge, we might not realize the effects it

654
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:15,360
could have on people. And when it comes to actually materially useful fields like medicine or engineering

655
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:22,240
or computer science or psychology, those impacts can do as much to harm as they can do to help.

656
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:27,280
And as much as I am deeply a proponent of science for the sake of science, knowledge for the sake

657
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,880
of knowledge, and don't need every question we attempt to answer to immediately have a tangible

658
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:40,000
use for humanity, I also think that we should maybe kind of actively try not to make knowledge that

659
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,120
is harmful. Maybe. And it's hard to do that if you can't even admit you're making it.

660
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:50,320
So yeah, our scientific understanding of gravity is socially constructed, and we are almost certainly

661
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:55,280
wrong about it in the exact same way that people at any point in the past have been wrong about it.

662
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:01,520
And yet, we've accomplished incredible things with it, like landing people on the moon or sending

663
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:07,280
a soundtrack of humanity to the furthest reaches of the solar system. Like, Einstein predicted

664
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:12,560
gravitational waves 100 years ago, and in the last decade, we started measuring them accurately

665
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:17,920
enough to detect when two black holes smash into each other in another galaxy. That is nothing

666
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:25,040
short of amazing. I am amazed. Amazed. But as amazing as it is, we did still make that knowledge

667
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:30,480
up, and we will continue to make knowledge up, and it will continue to be cool and useful and

668
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,840
interesting. Social constructivism doesn't negate science or say that nothing is real or that

669
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:41,120
everything is relative. It makes our understanding more complete by giving us a lens to analyze

670
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:47,280
why we do what we do and why we think what we think. To deny the inherently subjective

671
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:53,920
humanness in the endeavor of doing physics is to deny what pushed us to do it in the first place.

672
00:59:53,920 --> 01:00:00,880
Not ego or money or even utility, but curiosity. That spark that only comes when you realize that

673
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:05,440
you don't know something and that there might be more to the world than you thought before.

674
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:11,680
That drive to describe the ineffable that we attempt to satisfy through art and religion and

675
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:17,040
yeah, even science. When you hear an astronomer wax poetic about the beauty of the cosmos,

676
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:22,240
that's not rationality, that's mythology. And a thousand years from now, when future humans look

677
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,800
back at whatever remaining record there is about dark matter from today, and they're inevitably

678
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:32,320
mixing up our science with our pop culture, and they go, look at those humans from way back in

679
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:36,560
the day that invented this invisible stuff because they didn't understand this super

680
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:42,720
simple thing about gravity that even kids know today. It'll be fine because gravity is a social

681
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:52,000
construct and that's okay. Hey everyone, welcome to the end of the video. Thank you so much for

682
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:57,680
making it here. I had a lot of fun with this video. It might honestly be my favorite one so far

683
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,960
and I appreciate you watching it all the way to the end. In a second, I'm going to share some viewer

684
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:08,320
comments from my last video, which was about the tech industry and the TV show succession,

685
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:13,760
but first I gotta pay my bills. I already mentioned my Patreon and you probably know what Patreon is,

686
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,920
but just in case you don't, it's a website where you can sign up to give creators like me

687
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:23,040
a couple dollars a month in exchange for things like exclusive access to secret content,

688
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:30,080
having your names immortalized in my videos, and that tiny thing of helping me have an income.

689
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:35,600
Like I said before, I really, really, really, really appreciate everybody who signed up already.

690
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,520
I really encourage you to think about it if you're able to and if you're not, like, don't

691
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:44,240
worry about it. Otherwise, you can do the free things to support me, like liking the video,

692
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,640
sharing it with a friend, leaving a comment, subscribing to the channel. I know they all

693
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:53,520
seem kind of silly and small, but ultimately they make the numbers go up and that is what

694
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:58,240
determines how much I get paid. So enough of that, let's get into the succession comments.

695
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:05,440
So for context, this last video was where I used the very popular HBO show succession

696
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:13,760
to examine how some decisions are made re-regulation of the tech industry. Basically,

697
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:20,160
the gist is that the tech industry can be quite harmful and regulation is often seen as the way

698
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:26,880
to prevent that harm and regulation can do some things to prevent harm, but it has limitations

699
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:33,200
because of the fact that it's a top-down solution and therefore is ultimately controlled by people

700
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:39,840
with power. And my conclusion was that regulation's fine, but we should try to consider a multiplicity

701
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:44,720
of solutions for the problems we face with the tech industry. And so I asked people to share

702
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:50,960
what might be some of those solutions, particularly, like, what might be solutions that people can

703
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:56,160
engage in, not, like, what should the government do to fix everything. So before I share the kinds

704
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:02,160
of solutions that people suggested, I want to share one comment that I think is a really good framing

705
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:08,880
for the whole question of the role of, like, tech and software in, like, liberation projects.

706
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:14,160
So this is from Kevin Hengehold, who I actually know through the Patreon. I got really excited

707
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:18,640
learning about data and big tech during lockdown because I saw all the hype around Cambridge

708
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:23,920
Analytica and thought, fire with fire, right? But to build large-scale left-wing projects to

709
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:29,360
fight for workers' rights, housing rights, decommodified existence, etc., we need to develop

710
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:35,360
strong relationships that you can't get by A-B testing email subject lines. All that's to say,

711
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:40,640
I think it's better to find the people fighting a good cause and use tech to support it rather than

712
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:46,480
saying how can tech solve x, which I think puts the cart before the horse. I think he completely

713
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,840
hit the nail on the head with that comment. Like, I see a lot of really well-intentioned people with

714
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:56,720
a lot of very technical expertise try to, like, hold up their technical expertise as the solution

715
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:03,440
to whatever problem is ailing society, and it's not that their expertise has no place in a solution,

716
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:10,560
but it is not enough on its own. And I think what Kevin pointed out as, like,

717
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:15,680
you can't fight fire with fire when you're trying to do something more meaningful than burn

718
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:22,240
everything down. Becoming the socialist software developer or whatever it was from the last video

719
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:28,000
requires more than just imitating the enemy. The master's tools will not dismantle the master's house

720
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:35,840
but for algorithms. Now I've got three lifeboats or three solutions that a lot of people seem to

721
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:41,840
converge on. The first is open-source software, which is when software is made free and publicly

722
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:48,160
available along with the code that created it so people can use it and modify it and build upon

723
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:54,480
it freely. Nick Albritton3796 says, I think it's important to kickstart and develop new open-source

724
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:59,760
software technologies and to hopefully start building that same concept into hardware technologies,

725
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,400
removing the profit drive and leaving only the incentive of why people develop and use that

726
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,400
tech in the first place. And a lot of people said something very similar and I agree. But I

727
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,120
think something that was really interesting to see was not exactly the criticisms people had of

728
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:19,360
open-source, but kind of the caveats that should be kept in mind when trying to implement open-source

729
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:25,600
projects that seem really important. For example, respectable user name says, definitely agree on

730
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:30,640
the promoting open-source, but also putting in place mechanisms to support people working on

731
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:35,920
open-source as so often these folks are effectively working for all these big tech companies literally

732
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,800
for free. And there was another interesting critique I saw from Mary Reverie who says,

733
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:46,880
open-source software is not without fault either. It is the transparent aspect of website text that

734
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:53,440
allowed for proprietary LLMs like GPT to be created. There is no free lunch, brunch, or dinner.

735
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,000
Everyone has to think critically before putting stuff out. So yeah, open-source can be super

736
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,040
helpful in making more resources accessible to more people, but it does have the shortcoming that

737
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:09,120
big tech companies can take advantage of it just as easily as you or I. So the second lifeboat that

738
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:13,280
people converged on was education. And I know I talked about education in the video, but I was

739
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:17,520
mostly talking about college level education. There were actually a lot of people talking about

740
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:24,080
like K through 12 level education. So for example, Matias Lopez 6144 says, as a high school teacher

741
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:28,240
in Argentina, I have numerous students with different interests and political standpoints.

742
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:33,200
Many of them want to be programmers and are excited about AI and untrusting of international

743
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:38,320
corporations. One lifeboat is to foster community building in high schools, opening the debate and

744
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:43,600
showing other ways to live and to understand both society and technology. Treating our students

745
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:48,080
with respect and engaging with their interests in a matter that fosters their passion, empathy,

746
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:52,800
and love for their future profession and for the rest of humanity has the potential for helping in

747
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:57,920
the change. Something I really appreciate about your comment Matias was that you mentioned empathy

748
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:06,720
and based in the work I've done in like college level education for engineering ethics is that

749
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:11,040
it's really hard to imagine people who are learning engineering and computer science and all

750
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:17,280
these things go on being empathetic in their careers and in the things they create when they

751
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:22,160
weren't necessarily treated very empathetically as they were learning how to do those things.

752
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:26,480
And I feel like a lot of people might think it's weird to be like, we need to make engineers more

753
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:31,840
empathetic, but I kind of do think that's very important. And there were quite some other comments

754
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:37,280
from educators talking about engaging their students like this. John Hendricks 3253 says that

755
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:42,640
since 2016 they've taught a mini unit on media literacy where students learn strategies to

756
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:48,080
navigate and dismiss fake news, which is a really cool way to try to combat a specific harm of tech.

757
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:53,760
And there was even one high school student who talked about trying to engage their classmates

758
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,400
in conversations about tech and ethics and all this stuff. Misery of Micah says,

759
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:02,960
it seems really small, but being a high school student, soon to be college student,

760
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,600
I feel starting direct conversations with teachers and classmates about the role of technology in

761
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:13,120
our world would be a first step to decreasing anti-techno capitalist sentiment in this education

762
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:17,840
institution. I love that. And the last lifeboat I saw again and again was community engagement,

763
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:22,160
which made me very excited because I made a whole video about why that's so important for

764
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:30,320
doing any kind of politics. But I also saw someone talk about how community engagement

765
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:37,520
can kind of fill the personal hole that so many of us have that we try to fill with social media

766
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:43,200
and stuff like that. Burn Blue Fire K says, I think on the most individual level, what people need

767
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:47,840
is a sense of fulfillment or entertainment outside of what tech provides. Most people's

768
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:53,120
everyday use of tech or understanding of it just as a vehicle for content and or convenience.

769
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:57,760
Addictive but hollow on both the creator and the audience side. Learn to love something

770
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:03,520
about the place you're in. It helps to naturally form an investment in seeing it thrive. Have that

771
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,840
be in people's focus rather than all the things we see online that are functionally intangible

772
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:12,240
and feel impossible to do anything about. These interests will naturally lead to connections

773
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:19,040
Point is, there are so many different ways that so many different people can participate in a

774
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:24,880
resistance against whatever kind of oppressive force, be it big tech or anything else. And it's

775
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,560
so much fun to see the different ideas people come up with. Thank you so much for everybody who

776
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:35,120
left a comment. I don't know how to end this. I kind of want to just like end on something

777
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:40,000
like controversial. Exoplanet research is a sham.
