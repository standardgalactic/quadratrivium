WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
And we can use AI as we were just talking to make us radically more efficient at communicating

00:06.320 --> 00:12.880
with one another because communication can be radically better and alignment can be radically

00:12.880 --> 00:16.800
better and disambiguation can be radically better. People say words other people hear

00:16.800 --> 00:21.360
something else or they project something else onto it. Something needs to help us communicate

00:21.360 --> 00:27.520
with one another. And AI is going to do that. Mind indexing plus AI does just that.

00:35.600 --> 00:39.280
Welcome to the Cave Minds podcast. Welcome to the Cave Minds podcast here. We are we got an

00:39.280 --> 00:46.080
exciting guest today, Dimitri Shapiro. And he is the co-founder CEO of UAI. And he's got a pretty

00:46.080 --> 00:50.960
extensive background. And I'm excited to kind of share that through with everybody. So Dimitri

00:50.960 --> 00:55.760
aside from being the co-founder CEO of UAI and Koji, another company, he's also the founder

00:55.760 --> 01:02.480
CEO of Go Meta Inc. based in San Diego. And Dimitri, feel free to jump in at any point if I'm not

01:02.480 --> 01:07.680
not reading this right. But before this, he created the video sharing site Veo, which I've

01:07.680 --> 01:16.480
everyone has used back in 2005. And then he served as a CTO at MySpace, which is one of the most

01:16.560 --> 01:20.640
epic companies that everyone used back in the day. And then before moving on to Google,

01:21.360 --> 01:26.320
where he took up a role of Group Product Manager. And then after that, Dimitri left Google to

01:26.320 --> 01:31.200
found Go Meta. And then he has a bachelor's in electrical engineering from the Georgia

01:31.200 --> 01:37.120
Institute of Technology. Is that is that pretty good, Dimitri? I think it hits a bunch of points.

01:37.120 --> 01:44.960
I'm not sure if that it's in the right order. But that's all right. It's complicated. Yeah. So

01:44.960 --> 01:50.960
the way I describe myself these days is I'm an old nerd. I started writing code in 1984 when I was

01:50.960 --> 01:56.480
in high school. I studied electrical engineering and got a degree, but I've never done a day of it.

01:56.480 --> 02:03.440
I've always done software. I most recently before finding Go Meta, which is the company that owns

02:03.440 --> 02:11.200
Koji and owns UAI. So these are two platforms that Go Meta Inc. the holding company owns.

02:11.200 --> 02:19.040
And I'm CEO of Go Meta Inc. Therefore, you know, CEO of these two platforms Koji and UAI.

02:19.840 --> 02:25.440
Prior to that, I was at Google for four years on the main campus for the first three years. I ran

02:25.440 --> 02:30.720
three machine learning teams, a product for three machine learning teams that were crunching a bunch

02:30.720 --> 02:35.600
of implicit signals that Google had. Prior to that, I was CTO of Myspace. And then prior to that,

02:35.600 --> 02:41.600
I founded two other venture-backed companies. One was a major competitor to YouTube called Vio

02:41.600 --> 02:46.160
Networks, which is the one you mentioned. And then I also built a venture-backed cybersecurity

02:46.160 --> 02:51.520
company, enterprise software cybersecurity company called Aconics Systems, raised 34 million for

02:51.520 --> 02:59.360
that, raised 70 million for Vio. And then before both of those for five years from 95 to 99,

02:59.440 --> 03:04.800
I built the web team at Fujitsu, which is, you know, giant Japanese company. And so,

03:05.440 --> 03:10.000
as I said, I'm just an old nerd. You've been around, definitely. I mean, that's a lot of

03:10.000 --> 03:13.280
experience there. And then I think, like, they read the story, like, I think total,

03:13.840 --> 03:17.760
roughly, I think you've raised over 140 million venture capital from various companies.

03:19.040 --> 03:23.120
Okay. So let's jump into it. Because then, you know, our main topic here is like, we at Cavemines,

03:23.120 --> 03:29.440
we've got thousands of founders from networks like EO, YPO, Vistage, and a lot of startup grind.

03:29.440 --> 03:33.600
It's a wide commonator people. And then I think our main thing is that we want to bring on AI

03:33.600 --> 03:38.000
leaders. And that's why we have you here today. It's like people that have done it, been there,

03:38.000 --> 03:42.160
and are still doing it today, and just like building stuff within AI, even beyond that,

03:42.160 --> 03:47.680
like real AI, and then sharing the practical applications and like what they need to consider,

03:47.680 --> 03:51.120
and just shedding more light, because I've been having conversations with a lot of these founders

03:51.120 --> 03:56.000
that have built businesses, but in like outside of AI, and then if they're non-technical, they're

03:56.000 --> 04:01.760
all overwhelmed, like they don't know what's happening. They see all these tools, you know,

04:01.760 --> 04:05.520
they're using chat GPD, they're prompting, but they really don't know what they don't know.

04:05.520 --> 04:09.840
And, you know, they kind of stick to the lane. So and I think like that's one of the things when

04:09.840 --> 04:15.120
I was checking on you AI was like, wow, like you've simplified the ability to allow people,

04:15.120 --> 04:20.080
developers or even founders to go on and build an app within AI that they can actually start,

04:20.080 --> 04:23.920
like then releasing it and launching it. It's almost like you're creating like the AI app marketplace,

04:23.920 --> 04:29.200
essentially, especially, yeah, exactly there, and Mind Studio, especially to allow them to build in

04:29.200 --> 04:34.000
with it. And everything I like about UAI for all of you listeners, like, check it out, go on there,

04:34.000 --> 04:38.800
because you can go on there and you can actually see what is what is currently available, and it's

04:38.800 --> 04:44.080
all laid out in a very simple way. So there's no complex jargon or like text and stuff for you to

04:44.080 --> 04:47.600
like complicate and overwhelm me like other AI things. It's like really simple and easy to

04:47.600 --> 04:52.400
understand, which is not easy to do, especially to distill that information.

04:52.400 --> 04:58.080
Always making it a little bit crisper and tighter and constantly working on messaging,

04:58.080 --> 05:02.080
because these are complex things to describe to people. This is new to

05:03.200 --> 05:08.480
everyone. You know, I mean, I've been working with machine learning since 2006, when we started

05:08.480 --> 05:14.640
using it at VO, again, it's a YouTube competitor, we actually had recommendations, video recommendations

05:14.640 --> 05:20.480
before YouTube had them. My chief scientist at that time was Dr. Ted Dunning, who's a sort of

05:20.480 --> 05:26.160
world-renowned expert in collaborative filtering, which is a sort of a form of machine learning,

05:26.160 --> 05:31.040
not exactly machine learning, but used for similar things, you know, prior generations

05:31.040 --> 05:38.720
version of machine learning. So anyway, so yeah, I appreciate the compliment and I sympathize with

05:38.720 --> 05:46.560
founders who are trying to build companies in this environment. Again, this is my third

05:46.560 --> 05:52.560
venture-backed company. I've now been doing this one for seven years, the other two or five years

05:52.560 --> 06:03.200
each. So there you go, 17 years of this. And I think this is the most interesting time, meaning

06:03.200 --> 06:10.720
has many variables that must be considered that didn't exist in sort of my prior experience.

06:10.720 --> 06:15.200
Things used to feel relatively stable. I mean, you kind of knew what the floor was that you were

06:15.200 --> 06:19.440
building on, what the ground was what you were building on. Now the ground is sort of moving

06:19.440 --> 06:26.720
quite a bit. And everybody's struggling with it from founders to venture capitalists who also

06:26.720 --> 06:31.680
sort of don't know how to invest in this kind of an environment, because things that they're

06:31.680 --> 06:36.240
doing due diligence on this week, we're going to get disrupted later on this week.

06:36.240 --> 06:37.200
It's moving so fast.

06:37.200 --> 06:41.280
And then you start doing due diligence on that, and that gets disrupted. And you do that a few

06:41.280 --> 06:45.520
times. And all of a sudden they're like, well, it seems everything's about to get disrupted

06:45.520 --> 06:49.840
over and over again. How can we invest? And so I have a lot of friends that are venture

06:49.840 --> 06:54.160
capitalists that are sort of struggling, trying to figure out how do I do my job

06:55.040 --> 06:59.280
and in this kind of environment. So it's a difficult environment for everyone.

06:59.680 --> 07:08.160
But I believe, I think, certainly, that this is the best environment for new entrepreneurs

07:08.720 --> 07:17.680
to jump in and build companies. What AI, specifically generative AI, has brought to the

07:17.680 --> 07:24.560
table is the ability to build products much faster, like orders of magnitude faster,

07:25.120 --> 07:33.760
and with a lot less technical capabilities required from a human resource standpoint.

07:34.640 --> 07:42.720
You've seen large language models writing code. You've seen large language models responding

07:42.720 --> 07:50.480
to prompts that if those responses would have been somehow written in something other than

07:50.560 --> 07:55.760
a large language model, some kind of a heuristic approach, that would have been a lot of software

07:55.760 --> 07:59.600
development and a lot of data crunching to be able to give these kinds of responses.

07:59.600 --> 08:05.600
They come in a sense for free instantaneously. So those dynamics have changed dramatically of how

08:05.600 --> 08:12.000
quickly one can bring a new product to market. And we're sort of in the thick of things with

08:12.000 --> 08:19.680
UAI Mines Studio, to your point, which is someone can show up with an idea. And then in less than

08:19.680 --> 08:27.440
an hour, launch a product that leverages all of the power of chat GPT and Anthropics Clawed,

08:27.440 --> 08:35.040
we're Model Agnostic, so we support today GPT 33540, and also Clawed 1 and 2, so we'll support

08:35.040 --> 08:39.840
all the other models as well. And so you can sort of leverage the power of all of those in less than

08:39.840 --> 08:46.640
an hour, build a new service that you can launch on the internet, including monetization, that you

08:46.640 --> 08:51.200
ask people to give it a free tier and ask people to pay a subscription fee for it.

08:52.240 --> 08:57.600
And we now have over a thousand of these services that have been launched. This is the last month

08:57.600 --> 09:03.040
and a half since we announced Mines Studio. And I think a lot of them are like really profound,

09:03.040 --> 09:10.240
like, you know, people are building an AI medic. So basically like a physician that you can chat

09:10.240 --> 09:15.600
with and it'll diagnose your symptoms. There's also an AI vet. So if your pet is having symptoms,

09:15.600 --> 09:21.120
you can diagnose it. There's gardening assistance. If you want to plant tomatoes in San Diego where

09:21.120 --> 09:26.000
I live, this gardening assistant knows where you live and will tell you the exact time to plant

09:26.000 --> 09:29.520
tomatoes because if you're living in Northern California, this is the wrong time. You've got

09:29.520 --> 09:34.560
a different time. You're in a different zone, right? Or a parenting co-pilot. I have five kids.

09:36.160 --> 09:40.240
You could try to read all the books in the world. I don't have time to read any books.

09:40.240 --> 09:46.240
But I have on my phone a parenting assistant that's read every book. That's read every study.

09:47.280 --> 09:52.560
Because behind the scenes, it's just GPT-4. And it simply asks me what's happening.

09:53.120 --> 09:57.280
And it knows about my kids because I've already trained it. And that took two minutes less

09:57.840 --> 10:03.120
to train it. And so I can say, Una is crying because Diego won't go to sleep. And this thing

10:03.120 --> 10:08.080
knows that Diego is older and Una is younger and can tell me exactly what to say to Una,

10:08.080 --> 10:14.160
exactly what to say to Diego, how to frame any of it. And there's over a thousand more of those.

10:14.160 --> 10:17.360
Wow, that's interesting. Okay, that's super helpful because then I just realized I was playing

10:17.360 --> 10:22.240
around with it. And then I think that, yeah, like parenting is one use case and there's thousands

10:22.240 --> 10:26.000
of use cases there. But I think that like, if I can pop in and use it, because the difference that

10:26.000 --> 10:30.800
using GPT-4, you got to like heavily prompt and you got to do a new chat every time. But this is

10:30.800 --> 10:35.920
fully trained in that specific use case and it retains everything. And I think there's no limits

10:35.920 --> 10:40.480
as far as I know. I haven't reached any limits yet using it in terms of like, prompting. Like,

10:40.480 --> 10:46.400
it's like, I think, correct me. Other than context windows and standard things that are limits of

10:46.400 --> 10:52.960
modern LLMs, there are no limits. Because again, behind the scenes, think of us as like an abstraction

10:52.960 --> 10:59.600
layer, like the application abstraction layer, two large language models. Basically, we believe,

10:59.600 --> 11:03.920
which is what you're pointing at, that it doesn't make sense for consumers, for regular people,

11:04.000 --> 11:11.920
to go directly to chat GPT and start typing. You know, you are a blog writing assistant

11:12.800 --> 11:17.200
that has 40 years of experience and like all these things people write, please,

11:17.920 --> 11:23.280
I will give you examples, backspace, backspace. This doesn't make any sense. We believe AI should

11:23.280 --> 11:27.920
work the same way as mobile apps work, meaning there's an app for that. You want to write a

11:27.920 --> 11:32.960
blog post, you push the right blog post button, you want help with parenting, you push the parenting

11:32.960 --> 11:41.120
co-pilot button. And so prompt engineers, people who like, who are nerds like us, who want to go

11:41.120 --> 11:47.280
and craft those prompts and experiment and tune them up in Nuancem, those people should do the work

11:47.280 --> 11:54.480
to create that and package it using Mind Studio, package those prompts as consumer accessible

11:54.480 --> 12:00.000
AIs. And so we're basically just a prompt package. But it's more than prompt. It's prompt and system

12:00.000 --> 12:05.840
message and preamble and various parameters of, you know, large language models, temperature and

12:05.840 --> 12:11.440
dealing with context windows and overflows and summarizations. Like a lot of things there that

12:11.440 --> 12:18.080
we allow you as a prompt engineer to tune so that the consumer can simply answer the question,

12:18.080 --> 12:21.680
what do you want to write the blog post about and now paste a sample of your writing style.

12:21.680 --> 12:25.600
They only need to do that once, paste a sample of their writing style. From then on, they've

12:25.600 --> 12:30.960
trained their own personalized blog post writer. And from then on, all they have to do is say,

12:30.960 --> 12:36.080
I'm going to write a blog post of how, you know, AI is going to disrupt medicine. And it says,

12:36.080 --> 12:42.480
who's the audience? And you might say physicians who are concerned about AI displacing them, great,

12:42.480 --> 12:48.160
this thing is going to write a blog post in your writing style towards physicians that are concerned.

12:48.720 --> 12:54.800
How many words would a consumer have to write in order to set up ChatGPT to be able to do that?

12:54.800 --> 12:58.240
I think that's really cool because then my mind is kind of racing out because I think that I don't

12:58.240 --> 13:01.440
know if maybe this is already released. Maybe it's not correct me if I'm wrong, but like

13:02.320 --> 13:07.920
what if like, let's say the top five to 10 parent blogging apps or any of the categories there.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.360
And then they're like, okay, instead of us building this whole conversation of Chatbot using

13:11.920 --> 13:17.920
ABCD app, I want to just integrate the parenting app on UAI into our website. And then they pay,

13:18.880 --> 13:22.320
like they don't pay the consumer rate, but they pay like a business. Is that already available?

13:22.320 --> 13:28.160
Or is that something that's still in the works? Yeah, you can take, if you have content of your own,

13:28.720 --> 13:32.720
let's say you're a parenting blogger and you've got a bunch of your blog posts and so,

13:32.720 --> 13:39.680
in a sense, you can, your, your mental models are digitized. You've written a content. There it is.

13:40.320 --> 13:45.920
You can take MindStudio, our product, and you can take that content and integrate it

13:46.640 --> 13:54.560
into a URL that is a Chatbot and embed that on your blog or post it as a Instagram story. It's

13:54.560 --> 14:02.960
just a link. Share it anywhere on social media, post it to Twitter, I guess X. And, and yeah,

14:02.960 --> 14:07.440
so it's like really easy to do. And then you want to charge for it. Oh, wait, so the businesses

14:07.440 --> 14:11.760
where they don't pay for, they pay for the usage of it, meaning that like if they have a thousand

14:11.840 --> 14:16.400
visitors visiting the site and then they all 1000 use the app through their business website

14:16.400 --> 14:22.480
or through their blog. No, no, the way it's set up is that you as prompt engineer can show up,

14:22.480 --> 14:29.120
create a free account, start, you know, say, create new AI, we give you a bunch of templates you can

14:29.120 --> 14:36.640
use or you can use blank and make that AI again, typically takes a few minutes to an hour, maybe

14:36.640 --> 14:41.200
depends on like how much you want to geek out to really tune it up and make it awesome. But

14:41.760 --> 14:45.920
not huge amounts of time, including integrating your own data and all of that. And then when you

14:45.920 --> 14:50.320
publish it, that asks you to fill out some information. What do you want to call it? You

14:50.320 --> 14:54.560
know, give it an icon, give it like a sharing image. And then there's a section says, do you want to

14:54.560 --> 15:00.960
make it free to consumers to use? Or do you want to charge a subscription fee? You want to charge

15:00.960 --> 15:07.120
a subscription fee for me to use your AI as a consumer, I get a free tier, which typically,

15:07.120 --> 15:13.200
you know, I think 15 messages. And then it prompts me to give you money, depending on how

15:13.200 --> 15:17.120
much you've said you want to charge. Some people are charging dollars, some people are charging

15:17.120 --> 15:24.880
50 bucks a month. Again, we just launched payments the late last week before last, so like 10 days

15:24.880 --> 15:30.720
ago. And there are already people who have subscribers and making money, you know, so it's

15:31.280 --> 15:39.440
in the teens, not even 100, but still like the thing works. And people are starting to generate

15:39.440 --> 15:46.720
recurring revenue monthly subscribers for their hard work of doing prompt engineering, you know,

15:46.720 --> 15:52.320
figuring out what prompts work the right way and tuning all the other parameters and setting it

15:52.320 --> 15:57.600
out. This use cases them every blog, every any business really e-commerce, the world I come

15:57.680 --> 16:03.280
from like can definitely utilize building a specific app on it, putting it on as an embed

16:03.280 --> 16:07.920
somewhere or even on a page and being like, hey, like get like a customer AI chat bot with our

16:07.920 --> 16:12.400
thing. Or you can add them to home screens on mobile phones, right, because they're just web

16:12.400 --> 16:16.640
apps, you can bookmark them and add them to home screens, they're there. Again, we see people sharing

16:16.640 --> 16:20.640
them social media, that's an awesome channel to be able to do it because they'll render inside of

16:20.640 --> 16:25.200
a Facebook feed. Because they, you know, Facebook thinks of them as like articles. And so you get

16:25.280 --> 16:29.760
the open graph image in description and people can just tap on it or click on it and instantly get

16:29.760 --> 16:35.120
access to this AI inside of Instagram or Facebook or Twitter or anywhere else. Oh, wow. Okay. Very

16:35.120 --> 16:40.960
cool. And by the way, your point of like use cases, this is going to be just like the mobile app store,

16:40.960 --> 16:46.160
meaning what kind of apps are in the mobile app stores, over 2 million apps in each app store,

16:46.160 --> 16:52.640
apps for everything. There's an app for that. This is the same way. There should be an AI for that.

16:53.600 --> 16:59.520
Today, the AI for that is chat GPT. I have to go there and tell chat GPT to behave as some AI for

16:59.520 --> 17:04.880
that that we just discussed. But really what we should do is treat chat GPT as like raw material.

17:05.520 --> 17:10.720
And we prompt engineers take all that raw material and make out of it specific things for specific

17:10.720 --> 17:16.800
use cases that are much faster and easier for people to use consumers and SMBs and enterprises.

17:17.760 --> 17:25.760
The scope is infinite. It is. I think like, and that like is current product as of today. And

17:25.760 --> 17:29.200
like, what is what do you think is long term vision? What's the vision that you have like long

17:29.200 --> 17:32.640
term that you can share like, you know, publicly, I'm sure there's a lot of things happening behind

17:32.640 --> 17:43.520
the scenes. But yeah, I tend to be an open book. So I'll happily share. Yeah, so there's there's

17:44.080 --> 17:50.080
near term work that we're doing. And then there's a longer term vision that we believe in

17:50.880 --> 17:59.200
that we've already experimented with, meaning we put it into alpha and got data to show us that

17:59.200 --> 18:06.080
we are right. But that this is viable. I'll explain both of these to you. So there's the near term

18:06.080 --> 18:12.560
thing, which is mine studio. And so again, we believe that already these large language models

18:12.640 --> 18:17.680
and image diffusion models and video models that are coming out, all of these generative models

18:17.680 --> 18:24.560
are incredible, have countless literally countless use cases. But that the interface today that's

18:24.560 --> 18:31.920
provided to consumers, this sort of chatbot interface cannot be the right interface. You

18:31.920 --> 18:37.360
know, those of us that are old enough to remember DOS before there was Windows. DOS was generally

18:37.360 --> 18:43.920
unusable. It wasn't until we got Windows that computing took off. And this is the same thing

18:43.920 --> 18:49.360
we believe. And so while it's extraordinarily powerful, and it's amazing that people think that

18:49.360 --> 18:54.480
they need to become prompt engineers to be able to sort of live in this new world of leveraging AI,

18:54.480 --> 18:59.360
we don't believe that's true. We believe we prompt engineers, let's call ourselves people that are

18:59.360 --> 19:06.400
motivated to do this work should show up right now, use mine studio, and basically build out

19:06.480 --> 19:12.320
every use case possible. And you can do that now, you don't need any programming experience,

19:12.320 --> 19:16.480
there's no code to this, you need to be able to use language while though, you need to be able

19:16.480 --> 19:22.400
to be articulate, you have to explain, but that's what prompt writing is to be able to explain clearly

19:23.280 --> 19:28.000
what you want the thing to do. And so that is a skill that you should have, but you can show up

19:28.000 --> 19:32.480
now and do it. So that's the near term. And so we're making mine studio more powerful. So in it,

19:32.480 --> 19:36.560
for example, is something called automations, where you can do these like multi step workflows,

19:36.560 --> 19:41.680
you can collect input from a user, you know, during during their sessions, including, you know,

19:41.680 --> 19:46.400
long term memory. So this thing remembers. So when they come back next week or next year,

19:46.400 --> 19:50.880
this thing knows about them. So it's really, really powerful. Yeah, I don't have to constantly

19:50.880 --> 19:55.200
start up from scratch and and type. Yeah, that's the biggest challenge. And so we're expanding

19:55.200 --> 20:02.160
automation section, quite dramatically, we are making the sort of the output product itself

20:02.160 --> 20:09.040
the AI are creating better interfaces for it. So it's sort of more usable by consumers and

20:09.040 --> 20:18.000
and simpler to configure. We are adding analytics, deep analytics for AI creators to be able to

20:18.000 --> 20:23.520
understand how people are using their AI so they can take it and make better AI's and make new AI's

20:23.520 --> 20:27.840
and all of that. So there's a lot of work that's being done right now. You'll see a lot of releases

20:27.840 --> 20:34.720
coming from us in the mind studio realm, again, focused on creators of AI's these,

20:34.720 --> 20:38.800
let's call them prompt engineers for them, and for consumers that are engaging with those,

20:38.800 --> 20:45.200
that's one piece. Another piece is we run a directory called UAI UAI dot AI. And there you

20:45.200 --> 20:50.160
can go and find again, over 1000 of these AI's already. So think of it as like an app store

20:50.960 --> 20:58.400
for AI's, you can go and browse categories or search and find interesting tools, AI tools you

20:58.400 --> 21:03.040
can use and simply use them. And you know, the favorite section and you get again, as I said,

21:03.040 --> 21:06.400
you can just add them to your home screen and there you go. So we're going to make that better.

21:06.400 --> 21:10.720
Right now, discovery is dumb. There's some editorial that we do. There's nothing personalized.

21:10.720 --> 21:15.360
There's nothing algorithmic. But there's already a lot of like really powerful interesting stuff.

21:15.360 --> 21:19.200
And still invest some resources and discovery that's there. That's in the near term,

21:20.080 --> 21:25.040
longer term. Oh, by the way, look, this is the when I say near term, like this is certainly

21:25.040 --> 21:32.240
the next year, and probably next two years, as we're here. Because this opportunity is giant

21:33.280 --> 21:38.160
for there to be an app store for AI's and for all prompt engineers of the world

21:38.160 --> 21:44.080
to show up and sort of plant their flag and build all build out all of these services and

21:44.160 --> 21:49.280
then benefit from that by making a living doing it rather. We think again, another way to put it

21:49.280 --> 21:54.640
is if you want to start a new company, start it on you on on Mind Studio started on UAI Mind Studio.

21:55.440 --> 21:59.760
Show up, build an AI, say I want to make money from it monetize it. And there you go, you just

21:59.760 --> 22:04.160
launch the company. Later on today, you can watch another company being another product,

22:04.160 --> 22:09.600
probably one company, but another product, one was a AI medic, another one's an AI vet.

22:10.560 --> 22:16.160
Same thing sort of like you didn't have to do any work other than tell GPT that it's now a vet

22:16.160 --> 22:21.120
versus it's now a human medic. That's interesting. Everything else is reusable. And also, as you're

22:21.120 --> 22:25.520
talking about the short term time, short term side, one of the things I was thinking about was,

22:25.520 --> 22:30.160
let's say there's like 100 bed apps over the period of time, how do you navigate that from

22:30.160 --> 22:34.400
the consumer side? Business side doesn't affect it. But yeah, I mean, same way you do it in the

22:34.480 --> 22:39.120
App Store. How many calendars are there? How many calendars are there in the App Store? How many

22:39.120 --> 22:45.040
productivity apps are the countless of anything? And so you have ranking, right? And you have reviews,

22:45.680 --> 22:51.120
and you have usage stats. And you basically, it's a ranking problem. Okay. And then there's

22:51.120 --> 22:55.360
something that you'll build in like in the near term, we're doing that now. Yeah, that's one of

22:55.360 --> 22:59.200
the things that we're doing that because we already have, as I said, over 1000 ai's last week,

22:59.200 --> 23:03.280
there's over 100 created to accelerating. Yeah. And it makes sense because it's like easy to go on

23:03.280 --> 23:08.480
and hop on a build. Is there, do you have something to think about when it comes to like audio, like

23:08.480 --> 23:13.520
voice, the conversational within these apps? That would be interesting. Like instead of text,

23:13.520 --> 23:19.440
it's like, you can speak to that app. I mean, in a sense, you can speak to that because built into

23:19.440 --> 23:25.200
every desktop or mobile operating system now is, you know, voice to text capabilities, right? So

23:25.200 --> 23:29.360
you got a little microphone next to messenger. Oh, okay. You can just speak to wherever there's

23:29.360 --> 23:34.880
text input, we already have the way to take voice and trans transcode into text, basically.

23:35.440 --> 23:40.720
Yeah. So we don't have to build that. I thought where you were going is there are absolutely

23:43.120 --> 23:51.200
sound generation models that are starting to be available and meaningful. And also, you know,

23:52.160 --> 23:56.000
sort of music generation and speech generation is part of that.

23:57.200 --> 24:04.640
Where you can do sort of automated generation of audio. Today, we don't have any of those,

24:04.640 --> 24:10.400
but we absolutely will, because as I mentioned, we're completely model agnostic. And so we will

24:10.400 --> 24:16.720
support all major language models and diffusion models and video and audio and all of that.

24:16.720 --> 24:21.200
I was just thinking like how I would probably use it is I would just put you AI as the actual thing

24:21.200 --> 24:26.320
saved on my phone on my iPhone and just click on it and then use it as like, I can navigate and

24:26.320 --> 24:31.200
search everything also saving like specific apps as well. Because then I would be able to just like

24:31.200 --> 24:35.360
get access to everything in one go. And then I could find things. Yeah. Yeah. Like, I mean,

24:35.360 --> 24:39.680
I think I saw you posting things about prompts, right? Like, so I see people saying, Hey, I've got

24:39.680 --> 24:46.160
this like notion, you know, a sheet or I've got, I've got a spreadsheet that's got all these prompts.

24:46.160 --> 24:50.960
And you can just go find the right prompt and copy and paste it into chat GPT and do that. We

24:50.960 --> 24:56.640
think that's a silly way of doing things. If you've got a good prompt, turn it into an AI.

24:57.760 --> 25:02.320
So I as a consumer can just pick it and bookmark it and just use it whenever I want.

25:02.320 --> 25:06.000
Why should I have to go and open up a spreadsheet and copy and paste things

25:06.640 --> 25:10.400
into chat GPT? How does that make sense? Yeah, it's just inefficient. And even right now,

25:10.400 --> 25:14.640
like anytime we and the biggest thing is that it forgets. And if you delete it or you lose it,

25:14.720 --> 25:19.120
yeah, it's just everything. But I do like that the fact that you're agnostic is in you integrate

25:19.120 --> 25:24.560
all these other LLMs and API's and stuff. And then I don't have to manually go to five because

25:24.560 --> 25:28.400
right now what we're doing is like, even as like us trying to utilize different platforms,

25:28.400 --> 25:32.560
we're going to multiple different ones, try to link it together. And it just takes way more

25:32.560 --> 25:37.600
time than it's necessary, which versus I can just use that one, go to you and then be able to

25:37.600 --> 25:41.600
integrate. Hey, I want to use these anthropic or use like open AI or something like that.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.560
Totally. Okay, yeah, interesting. We support those now.

25:45.520 --> 25:49.600
Yeah, that makes sense. And then okay, so in the going back to long term, like do you in like

25:49.600 --> 25:53.200
five to 10 years, I guess, like, where do you where do you kind of see that like some that

25:53.200 --> 25:59.120
that's what's interesting? Yeah, so that is the long term piece that I want to tell you about. So

26:00.400 --> 26:08.560
in May, so just a few months ago, we launched an alpha of UAI. This is before we had Mind Studio.

26:08.560 --> 26:15.600
Mind Studio sort of came out of UAI. And our our vision there that we articulated to people and

26:15.600 --> 26:22.480
said, please come and play with it if you want is this, that the right way to truly leverage

26:23.920 --> 26:32.320
all the power of modern information technology, meaning that continues to accelerate, we have

26:32.320 --> 26:37.040
Google, which by the way behind the scenes is all machine learning output that's not seen as an AI

26:37.040 --> 26:41.920
platform, but it's absolutely an AI platform, or YouTube or any of these things are all behind

26:41.920 --> 26:47.600
the scenes driven by machine learning. That's why they are so good. But but now we have these

26:47.600 --> 26:52.320
new generative models, and all of that is just accelerating faster and faster and faster. And

26:52.320 --> 26:58.640
so the thing that we pointed out is that we believe that humans are the bottleneck already

26:59.200 --> 27:04.160
in being able to leverage all of the power of information technology, meaning I'll get you

27:04.160 --> 27:10.080
like this, there are countless mobile apps I could be using right now that would make me better,

27:10.080 --> 27:17.520
smarter, faster, happier, etc. I have no time to go find them, set them up, learn to use them and

27:17.520 --> 27:24.080
use them. I am the bottleneck. The technology exists, but I'm the bottleneck. All of these new

27:24.080 --> 27:30.480
large language models are really sort of exacerbating that and making it clear that human beings are

27:30.480 --> 27:35.280
the bottleneck in being able to leverage all the power. This is why things like auto GPT are

27:35.280 --> 27:40.640
exciting because you take the human out of the loop all of a sudden you have wire speed AI. Well,

27:40.640 --> 27:46.160
now we're talking. It's not guided very well. So we believe that the real problem is the problem

27:46.720 --> 27:54.240
of human to digital interface. And today it's gotten even worse because we said that the interface is

27:54.240 --> 28:00.160
a chat box, which is one of the worst interfaces to it. We believe the right interface to that

28:00.240 --> 28:06.640
is to take our minds, all of these beliefs, biases, mental constructs, desires, all those things in

28:06.640 --> 28:14.080
our minds and digitize them, turn them into a data set. So we can then take that data set and grant

28:14.080 --> 28:21.600
it to AI, which by the way, these are all neural networks. They don't want prompts. They want data

28:21.680 --> 28:31.200
sets. Their core thing that they do is they take data sets and they process them and they find

28:31.200 --> 28:37.520
structure in them, where structure may not have been seen by humans or was seen, but they're

28:37.520 --> 28:42.480
much better at doing it. Statistically, meaningful features. That's what these things do. And so

28:42.480 --> 28:48.000
if we digitize our minds somehow, and I'll explain to you how we did it that works, you can play with

28:48.000 --> 28:53.840
it, then you get a data set of your mind and you can simply give that to AI and AI can sort of look

28:53.840 --> 28:58.800
and say, uh-huh, I grok you. I understand how you're different from this person or different from the

28:58.800 --> 29:03.600
majority or whatever. I understand what your strengths are. I understand what your weaknesses are. I

29:03.600 --> 29:07.840
understand what your gaps of knowledge are. I understand what your desires are. And then I,

29:08.720 --> 29:14.080
the AI, can take the lead and say, you don't need to prompt me anymore. Let me take the lead and make

29:14.160 --> 29:19.200
proposals for you. I think you might like this. Do you like it? And you say, yes, please do that.

29:19.200 --> 29:23.920
Thank you. I got you. What about this? I thought you might want to learn this. I've created a custom

29:24.720 --> 29:28.800
learning material for you because I thought that you understood prompt engineering,

29:28.800 --> 29:32.800
but it seemed you didn't understand this dimension of prompt engineering. And so I filled that in

29:32.800 --> 29:37.840
for you. Here it is. Just that. Instead of giving you more things to read about prompt engineering.

29:37.840 --> 29:43.920
And so anyway, so we believe that's the future of human beings being able to leverage all of the

29:43.920 --> 29:50.720
accelerating power of information technology is to for us not to interface with this technology

29:50.720 --> 29:56.720
directly, but for us to, in a sense, interface with this proxy, this mind indexing proxy.

29:56.720 --> 30:01.680
And because our minds are constantly changing, this is something that we do from now on. And by

30:01.680 --> 30:08.240
the way, what does it feel like? It feels like TikTok. It feels like a never ending feed of

30:08.240 --> 30:14.320
proposals and interfaces that we present to human and say, how would you choose? Some are

30:14.320 --> 30:20.240
open answer questions. Some are multiple choice questions. Some are high density grids that say,

30:20.240 --> 30:26.880
tap all the things that seem yummy. How would you describe yummy to chat GPT in words if you

30:26.880 --> 30:32.400
wanted to recommend food choices for you? That take a lot of words. It would be very crude.

30:33.040 --> 30:38.160
But if I give you just a few screens of high density screens of images and say,

30:38.160 --> 30:44.560
pick the things that seem yummy, I can build a vector that differentiates you from me or from

30:44.560 --> 30:52.800
other people. You see? And so we announced this. We had over 5,000 people show up in our alpha

30:53.520 --> 30:59.840
and go through a median number of prompts. We call them prompts that we presented to them

30:59.840 --> 31:08.000
answered as 177. So 177 explicitly articulated data points. And by the way, the reason it was,

31:08.000 --> 31:12.320
you know, on one hand, that's extraordinarily high. On the other hand, that's limited because we only

31:12.320 --> 31:18.880
had a limited number of prompts in there. And so people ran out of things to answer. And we paused

31:18.880 --> 31:25.440
it for a moment, well, moment, maybe for a little bit of time, because we realized from that that

31:25.600 --> 31:31.920
that is going to work. Like we could really go in that and digitize people's minds. But for what?

31:31.920 --> 31:36.800
What are they going to get for that in the near term? That's where Mind Studio comes in.

31:37.920 --> 31:42.800
What they get for that is all of these AIs that are being built right now with Mind Studio can

31:42.800 --> 31:51.520
leverage all of that data that's being collected by Mind Indexing. You can grant it. You can grant

31:51.520 --> 31:58.000
any new AI you discover. It can ask you, can I use this set of data about you? And you can say yes.

31:58.640 --> 32:00.800
And it's instantly trained, personalized to you.

32:00.800 --> 32:06.240
You're essentially like, it's like a close thing to like digital, digitizing one's mind and also

32:06.240 --> 32:12.560
like replicating them. You know, a lot of good points. I guess like, I can tell you philosophical

32:12.560 --> 32:16.160
as well, like, what do you think are the philosophical implications of this, like the

32:16.160 --> 32:21.520
digitization of one's mind and removing someone to fully, I guess, quote unquote,

32:21.520 --> 32:26.720
build a fully AI-powered experience where the human isn't getting involved in each step and like

32:26.720 --> 32:33.520
all that stuff that's currently the state of AI? Yeah, I think, I mean, it's a brave new world,

32:33.520 --> 32:39.600
like it's profoundly transformative. First of all, obviously the speed of ability for a human

32:39.600 --> 32:49.760
to communicate with machine becomes many orders of magnitude faster. So that itself is profound.

32:49.760 --> 32:53.760
The ability and one of, I think one of the biggest problems humans have is we don't know what we

32:53.760 --> 33:02.160
don't know. And this thing can figure out what we don't know and fill in the gaps for us. And so

33:02.160 --> 33:08.960
education gets transformed radically. So the pace of education, you know, goes up dramatically.

33:09.920 --> 33:15.200
And everyone gets basically personal content delivered to them. It also transforms the web.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.680
It doesn't make sense anymore to create websites that are geared towards personas

33:20.400 --> 33:25.600
or ideal customer profiles. There is no such thing. These are all crude caricatures. Any

33:25.600 --> 33:30.640
person, any marketing team has ever built is a crude caricature of something that doesn't exist.

33:30.640 --> 33:36.960
Each person is infinitely complex, individual. So this thing could actually sort of leverage that

33:36.960 --> 33:43.440
data where a human shows up to an e-commerce site and says, here's me in data form. An e-commerce

33:43.440 --> 33:48.800
site says, I grok you, here are the things that you would like from our catalog of things. Let

33:48.800 --> 33:53.120
me explain them to you in the language you will understand how they will matter in your life

33:53.120 --> 33:58.080
and why you should choose this over our competitors product. So everything becomes

33:58.080 --> 34:04.640
ultra personalized content created on demand for each one of us based upon, again, our states of

34:04.640 --> 34:09.120
being. That's the right way it should be. That's the way humans do it. Like if you have a human

34:09.120 --> 34:13.840
salesperson, why is a human salesperson better than just a website? Because a human person can

34:13.840 --> 34:20.160
have a conversation with the other human and understand them in a more nuanced way and then

34:20.160 --> 34:25.600
paraphrase thing to them and leave them from where they are now to where we need them to be.

34:26.320 --> 34:30.960
And that can only be done by understanding who is the customer in this case. And by the way,

34:30.960 --> 34:34.960
of course, beyond that, you start to get into all kinds of other crazy things, which is when you

34:34.960 --> 34:40.720
digitize, again, I've thought about this now for years and so I'll propose some things that to me

34:40.720 --> 34:47.920
are quite obvious, but won't be obvious at first blush, which is, so I'm married. My wife and I

34:47.920 --> 34:52.800
just celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary. We have five kids. I know her extraordinarily well.

34:53.520 --> 34:58.000
But periodically, there are still things that come out in conversation. I'm like,

34:58.880 --> 35:03.840
how did I not know this about you? I've had this with Fran, 54 years old. I've had this

35:03.840 --> 35:09.840
with friends I've known for 30 years. I'm like, how is it possible that we'd never touched upon

35:09.840 --> 35:15.040
that? Or I always assumed you were this or now you're this, right? Well, because I propose to

35:15.600 --> 35:21.440
you and the listeners that we know a very thin veneer of one another.

35:22.240 --> 35:28.240
Human communication is very shallow. We don't have time to go deep. It's uncomfortable to go deep.

35:29.840 --> 35:35.120
Who takes the lead on making things deeper? It's hard to do that. But if we are all indexing

35:35.120 --> 35:39.680
our own mind, we can show up at a situation and say, hey, do you want to compare mental models?

35:40.640 --> 35:47.280
And then say yes and yes. And all of a sudden, instantly look at that data and realize all of

35:47.280 --> 35:52.000
these amazing things that we have in common that we would have never discovered in 40 years of friendship.

35:52.560 --> 35:58.160
But now we can see them. We can go deep. We can find misalignment where I thought you believed

35:58.160 --> 36:02.000
this, but you actually don't. No wonder we've been miscommunicating or I've been trying to get

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
you to see things in some way. But you can't see them in that way because of this thing. I would

36:06.000 --> 36:10.160
have never known that about you. How would I discover that? But because we're digitizing minds,

36:10.160 --> 36:16.160
we can overlay and do that. We can also do that in teams, which is profound. I run companies.

36:17.040 --> 36:21.280
Running companies is one of the hardest things, mostly in alignment and communication.

36:22.480 --> 36:27.520
People say, we agree. We're going in the right direction. I say, I'm not sure that's true. Explain

36:27.520 --> 36:31.280
it to me in your own words. And they explain it. I'm like, okay, we're aligned. And then all of a

36:31.280 --> 36:35.600
sudden we somehow are moving in different directions. How? Well, because the vector

36:35.600 --> 36:40.080
from which we were looking at it, it seemed like we were aligned because we're pointing at a point

36:40.080 --> 36:45.520
in space, but we're pointing from different directions. This thing can find misalignment

36:46.240 --> 36:50.960
and help us align. So we can work together. So anyway, so like those kinds of things become

36:50.960 --> 36:56.480
quite profound and transformative to society. That was honestly like, I don't even know how to

36:56.480 --> 37:00.880
describe it. But I think that what you just shared is like, mind blowing, because to me,

37:00.880 --> 37:05.360
that changes relationships forever, in the sense that like, if I don't know how it would look like

37:05.360 --> 37:09.280
functionally, like tactically, but if what you just described as a concept, if I can just press a

37:09.280 --> 37:13.760
button, and then we know everything, and then if they're, and then we can just look at it or maybe

37:13.760 --> 37:17.360
scroll through up there, this is like a caveman version of where we're at, but they scroll through

37:17.360 --> 37:22.560
like, Oh, Julie or John, we have all these things in common. These are things that we don't want.

37:22.560 --> 37:26.480
And it's the things that you didn't know, or you didn't know, or that would actually be,

37:26.480 --> 37:31.200
I would love to use that. That would be a very near that we almost launched that.

37:33.120 --> 37:37.920
We could in a sense launch it at any week, we're close to being able to launch that we now have

37:37.920 --> 37:44.880
over, I think just under 10,000 people who've been digitizing minds, maybe it's now above 10,000,

37:44.880 --> 37:51.680
but some are in that range. This is with UAI. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And so we actually, like

37:51.680 --> 37:57.520
said, we started, we almost launched that comparison thing. And it's just a mobile interface or desktop

37:57.520 --> 38:02.800
interface that says, you know, given these two people, they can both consent, because obviously

38:02.800 --> 38:06.720
the information is private consent, and then say, great, okay, let me compare the two of you.

38:06.720 --> 38:10.320
And then it comes out and it actually explains it to you and just plain English, like it even

38:10.320 --> 38:14.800
does the parsing in the process. Oh, wow. You don't have to just like look at data. I mean,

38:14.800 --> 38:19.600
you can look at the raw data too. But like, you can summarize it for you and it can help you grok,

38:20.560 --> 38:26.480
you know, how to interact with other humans, like human communications about to change radically.

38:26.480 --> 38:30.160
Yes. Because then it changes the way that we not just build a relationship, but it helps us build

38:30.160 --> 38:34.880
deeper and more meaningful relationship. Because when we save the time of, because we have limited

38:34.880 --> 38:39.680
time. And so like having hours and hours of conversation that we normally have now is meaningful,

38:39.680 --> 38:44.000
but it's, it's also there's a level of AI where what you described as a thing that's being built.

38:44.720 --> 38:48.800
Yeah, that's really exciting. Actually, I can see I can, I would definitely use that because I was

38:48.800 --> 38:53.440
even thinking the other day, and this is just like a in a nutshell version, like we do so many

38:53.440 --> 38:56.880
intro calls in business. And then everyone's like, Hey, can we hop on an intro call, intro call? And

38:56.880 --> 39:01.440
then like in the lifetime of business, we probably do thousands of intro calls. What if there's a

39:01.440 --> 39:06.320
way to literally apply what you just shared into the intro calls? And then, you know, and then we

39:06.320 --> 39:10.080
get into kind of like the, Hey, this is the core thing that we can add value to each other in that

39:10.080 --> 39:14.800
way. But we save the 30 minutes in one hour, not to say that it's not meaningful, but it's just

39:15.600 --> 39:20.160
to focus on building and doing more creative work and whatnot. I think that would be like

39:20.160 --> 39:26.400
really interesting as well. And you can instantly go deep. You can skip all the shallow stuff.

39:26.400 --> 39:30.400
Again, doesn't mean you don't do shallow stuff. Shallow stuff is interesting, flirting is great.

39:30.960 --> 39:36.000
But, but the real value happens in the depths. Yep. In personal relationships and business

39:36.000 --> 39:42.240
relationships, the devil is in the details. So get to the details. Because the rest,

39:42.240 --> 39:49.520
why should we waste our time talking it? It's much faster to index it, have the AI summarize it

39:50.960 --> 39:57.520
and let you guys now move on to the depths. You're both good people. I AI think you should

39:57.520 --> 40:02.080
work together. It looks like you're going to fit. Great. Let's get in the depths of it.

40:02.080 --> 40:06.640
This is really interesting. What if, since we're riffing on it, like just what if you imagine

40:06.640 --> 40:12.800
like that, but then you add in a audio replica version of the person and then that person would,

40:13.360 --> 40:17.760
after the matching is done, the audio would be there. And then you, the person that want to

40:17.760 --> 40:22.080
interact with them could do, could have a call with the audio version of it. So similar to,

40:22.080 --> 40:26.080
I don't know if you've seen, you've probably seen air.ai where it's like an AI version of

40:26.800 --> 40:31.200
the person having a conversation. And then let's say they, once they have the conversation,

40:31.200 --> 40:36.640
then it goes into that real, real self. So it's like the AI version of you having a conversation

40:36.640 --> 40:40.560
with a real person and then it becomes a real person. Yeah. So look, I think a lot, you know,

40:40.560 --> 40:45.600
lots of people are doing lots of interesting things. My personal gut feel, take that with a

40:45.600 --> 40:53.840
trillion pounds of salt. But my personal opinion is that at least for the near future, humans are

40:53.840 --> 41:02.480
going to be generally allergic to speaking with your AI avatar instead of you. It's disrespectful.

41:02.480 --> 41:08.880
It's like speaking to a, to an answering machine. And that doesn't feel right. But

41:09.680 --> 41:15.200
since we can make our calls much shorter, we can be much more efficient is what we were just talking

41:15.200 --> 41:21.200
about is we can skip all the fluff and instantly understand one another and have a short call

41:21.200 --> 41:26.800
and build rapport and get questions answered. And I know that you human answered me rather than

41:26.800 --> 41:32.240
like your, your avatar. The same thing with like all of these like writing things that will reply

41:32.240 --> 41:36.880
to emails for you and all of that. As soon as that becomes mainstream, I think that's just going

41:36.880 --> 41:42.720
to generally kill email. Because like, what am I talking? Who am I talking to? Not talking to a

41:42.720 --> 41:48.160
human. Can I take that to the bank? Oh no, my AI was hallucinating. I didn't mean that. I didn't

41:48.160 --> 41:53.040
say that AI said it. So anyway, I'm not bullish on those things. I think they're novelties.

41:53.920 --> 42:00.400
Now they're amazing novelties, you know, and we've got things that can generate content like you.

42:00.400 --> 42:04.880
So you can answer emails and do all that. That's great and sound like you. But is that good? I'm

42:04.880 --> 42:08.720
not sure. I don't think so. That's a good point. I think the respect part is key. Like you touched

42:08.720 --> 42:13.120
on that just that one word represents it's like, I think once you do the matching, then the human

42:13.520 --> 42:17.760
interaction, you can't at least like based on what we're talking about, you can't scale that

42:18.320 --> 42:22.240
without the human elements always going to be important at the very bottom to build those

42:22.240 --> 42:28.880
relationships. Yeah, we can use AI as we were just talking to make us radically more efficient at

42:28.880 --> 42:36.480
communicating with one another. And therefore we could interact with more humans. Or we could

42:36.800 --> 42:43.760
or we can get much deeper with one human using our time. Because communication can be

42:44.720 --> 42:49.760
radically better. And alignment can be radically better. And disambiguation can be radically

42:49.760 --> 42:56.400
better. And all of that human communication is looking at it from this lens is extraordinarily

42:56.400 --> 43:02.000
draconian. We're in the dark ages of human communication. By the way, this is why we have

43:02.000 --> 43:08.400
the battles we have in culture wars and all of this other stuff that we see sort of all around

43:08.400 --> 43:13.760
this right now. All of this outrage. It's a communication problem. People say words, other

43:13.760 --> 43:18.160
people hear something else, or they project something else onto something needs to help us

43:18.160 --> 43:24.800
communicate with one another. And AI is going to do that mind indexing plus AI does just that.

43:24.800 --> 43:28.160
Okay, that's a quote right there. We're going to quote that part that you just went through. That's

43:28.160 --> 43:34.560
exactly it. So next thing I would say would be, you know, some interesting questions I had was

43:34.560 --> 43:39.280
like, you know, as a, what are your thoughts actually now that we're talking about it, like

43:39.280 --> 43:43.680
what are your thoughts on the GPT wrapper stuff where like, you know, people are just basically

43:43.680 --> 43:48.480
using the open AI stuff and then just building like, one single feature thing. And then they're

43:48.480 --> 43:56.400
making like, I don't know, 2550k 100k off it versus building a long term sustainable AI business

43:56.400 --> 44:00.240
like you AI and then actually like literally thinking about the product, building a team,

44:00.880 --> 44:04.480
you know, the two, like what do you what do you thoughts on those like, is it you think it's like

44:04.480 --> 44:08.400
either or like pros and cons, obviously, but like, what do you think is like,

44:09.520 --> 44:12.800
just general thoughts around it, the people that are doing either or.

44:13.520 --> 44:20.080
Yeah. So both of those work and both of those are needed. I like to build platforms. I like to

44:20.080 --> 44:24.880
build things that other people use to build things. Yeah. I don't like to build products,

44:24.960 --> 44:29.280
actually. Like if you said to me, build an e-commerce store and go run it to me, that's

44:29.840 --> 44:34.000
very uninteresting. I'm not knocking at some people. It's extraordinarily interesting.

44:34.000 --> 44:39.520
But to me, it's not, but build a platform that allows people to build many e-commerce stores.

44:39.520 --> 44:45.120
That's interesting. And so that's, so my advice to entrepreneurs is work on things that interest

44:45.120 --> 44:49.200
you. That's the most important parts. If you're interested at the layer of platform,

44:49.200 --> 44:54.720
go build a platform company. If you're interested in AI as a solution for some kind of a

44:54.720 --> 45:00.560
problem and you want to build something that wraps that leverages chat, GPT or Claude or whatever,

45:00.560 --> 45:06.160
and then provides a real service to consumers, you should do that. I would say go do it on

45:06.160 --> 45:10.400
on mine studio because that's the fastest, easiest way to do it. I don't know if faster

45:10.400 --> 45:14.080
way to do it. You don't need to launch a, you don't need to go raise venture capital. That's

45:14.080 --> 45:19.360
right. Bootstrap, build it and then like ship it because that speed at time is like of the essence.

45:19.360 --> 45:23.360
Yeah. And again, I'm not kidding. You can do it this afternoon. Whenever you hear this,

45:23.360 --> 45:29.040
you can do it that same day and launch it and promote it and start to make money that same day.

45:29.040 --> 45:32.880
And then the next day build another one because again, there's countless use cases that need to

45:32.880 --> 45:37.120
be enumerated and built out. So I think both of those approaches work just depends on what you're,

45:37.680 --> 45:42.160
what you like doing. It's going to be interesting on these about the second order effects of you

45:42.160 --> 45:46.320
creating the platform and then people going on and literally building agencies. I'm excited to see

45:46.320 --> 45:50.800
that of like, Hey, we're going to build on you AI for the small businesses that don't know anything

45:50.800 --> 45:55.120
about AI. And then they just like build it for them or even just any business. And then they'll

45:55.120 --> 45:59.600
be charging like thousands of dollars. I'm sure it's going to happen. Someone's going to do it.

45:59.600 --> 46:03.040
And it's going to be really good. I know who's going to do it first because we're about, they

46:03.040 --> 46:09.120
reached out to us and there we go with them. So what you described is literally about to happen

46:09.120 --> 46:14.400
where I can't give it away. Unfortunately here, but, but you'll see it and there'll be a

46:15.040 --> 46:22.080
first of many I'm sure partnerships of other companies, big companies. This one's over 20 years

46:22.080 --> 46:28.400
old has got over 2000 employees that are showing up and saying, Hey, we can leverage all of this

46:28.400 --> 46:33.200
power we have with our customer base. And we just want to be able to very quickly,

46:34.640 --> 46:41.120
you know, create a bunch of AI services that we can then sell to our existing clients

46:41.760 --> 46:46.000
and new clients. And these are in businesses. So this is not a consumer thing. It's a

46:46.800 --> 46:50.800
SMB primarily thing. And the platform just gets better and better. So it makes sense.

46:50.800 --> 46:55.440
It's like a long-term partnership. Interesting. What do you think would be the, you know,

46:55.440 --> 46:59.760
aside from you AI, what do you think could be the next let's quote unquote say like most impactful

47:00.560 --> 47:04.800
AI business that no one is building because you've seen a lot. So what would you say would be

47:04.800 --> 47:12.400
something that you're like, Oh, okay. I think the businesses is a big sort of question mark word

47:12.400 --> 47:16.640
there. If we can take that out and forget the business part of it, because there's a bunch of

47:16.640 --> 47:23.680
business dynamics that might prevent extraordinarily powerful things, transformative things to occur

47:24.480 --> 47:28.240
and that could radically change the world. And by the way, then change how you would even build

47:28.240 --> 47:33.280
businesses. Like what does it mean to build a business? If we were talking early in the podcast,

47:33.280 --> 47:37.440
right? I said that venture capitalists are struggling with sort of the pace of disruption.

47:38.240 --> 47:42.000
And I think that's only going to accelerate. And so how do you build a business? What is a

47:42.000 --> 47:46.800
business? You certainly don't write a business plan. Do you have time to incorporate? No,

47:46.800 --> 47:51.520
you don't. I mean, you should, but you do that later. The first thing you do is you throw a lot

47:51.520 --> 47:55.040
of stuff at the wall and see what sticks. And once it sticks, that's when you build a business

47:55.040 --> 48:00.880
around. And so like finding product market fit becomes something you do multiple times a day on

48:00.880 --> 48:04.480
different things until you find it. And then you very quickly go do it. And by the way,

48:04.480 --> 48:09.440
you'll probably get disrupted shortly thereafter, because other people can do that too.

48:09.440 --> 48:14.240
Once they have the idea, they'll do that too. And that's going to be really hard to build

48:14.240 --> 48:19.760
businesses in general, not kind of an environment. Yeah. So well, if we take that off the table,

48:20.560 --> 48:25.280
then it becomes arguably even a more difficult question, because everywhere you look,

48:26.240 --> 48:33.200
their AI is going to create transformative, like massively transformative change. Look at medicine,

48:33.760 --> 48:41.760
will radically transform medicine, access to diagnosis, ability for personalized treatment

48:41.760 --> 48:51.040
plans, discovery, research, one of the reasons that we got these mRNA vaccines so quickly

48:51.040 --> 48:54.800
is because of our current computing capabilities to be able to run all these things, right? And we

48:55.360 --> 49:02.240
do things proactively. So you're doing research while we sleep at wire speed, right? And that's,

49:02.240 --> 49:07.280
by the way, only accelerating. And so whatever, that's medicine, you can pick anything else.

49:07.280 --> 49:14.240
But I'll point you to one that we talked about earlier, which is the creator economy is about

49:14.240 --> 49:20.800
to be destroyed, I believe, as an economy. Now this is going to be provocative. And because I

49:20.800 --> 49:24.720
built a company in the creator economy space, it becomes even more provocative. And I'm not

49:24.800 --> 49:30.720
trying to be provocative. I just want to point to something that we think is obvious, which is

49:30.720 --> 49:36.400
humans are obviously creative beings. And so we will never stop creating for the sake of creating

49:36.400 --> 49:42.640
and using our creations as a means of communicating with one another, self expression, etc. Check.

49:42.640 --> 49:46.800
But making that into a business and monetizing it, when you make something into a business,

49:47.440 --> 49:53.440
you start to deal with the cost of goods. How much time does it take me to produce a piece of

49:53.440 --> 49:58.880
content versus how much money can I get from producing that content? As soon as you look at

49:58.880 --> 50:06.080
that equation, it becomes very clear that there's no need, no possibility for humans to compete with

50:06.080 --> 50:13.280
automated content creation. Personalized automated content creation. So we already see

50:13.280 --> 50:18.560
automated YouTube channels, mostly the stuff that producing is kind of junk. Soon it won't be junk.

50:18.720 --> 50:24.080
It'll be as compelling as anything produced by a human. But it'll be produced on demand for each of

50:24.080 --> 50:29.280
us individually. And that's obviously going to be radically more compelling than anything else.

50:29.280 --> 50:34.240
And so I think the only YouTubers in the sense that might get a pass for a little while are the

50:34.240 --> 50:40.000
YouTubers where the content is about them, the human, not about anything else. Because that goes

50:40.000 --> 50:44.000
back to that thing we were just talking about where I don't want to talk to your AI. I want to

50:44.000 --> 50:49.520
talk to your AI. I want to talk to you. I don't want to see your AI generated, you know, vlog

50:49.520 --> 50:55.840
videos. I want to see you. Okay, great. Then you're safe. But for everything else, I don't care if

50:55.840 --> 51:02.800
it's you who created it or not. I care about the topic. And there that topic is going to be, again,

51:02.800 --> 51:06.800
because it's personalized, it's going to be so much better than anything you could possibly

51:06.800 --> 51:12.320
afford to produce. And that's going to be very, very disruptive. That's true. Because then it's

51:13.200 --> 51:17.280
self-explanatory, like it's just personalized to me. I don't need to search for anything.

51:17.840 --> 51:21.520
And that's the ultimate, yeah, personalization AI. Interesting. Okay.

51:22.560 --> 51:30.000
Proactive AI. AI, we shouldn't be asking AI what to do generally. Again, this is the Dark Ages.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.640
Another way of looking at it is try to explain some people like, if you met a genie, and the genie

51:34.640 --> 51:40.800
said, I can, I'll answer any of your questions. What do you want to know? And some people say,

51:40.800 --> 51:45.200
what's the meaning of life and all that? That's great. But I say that my question would be,

51:46.160 --> 51:52.160
what question should I ask? What should I know that I don't know? What's the most important thing

51:52.160 --> 51:58.560
to know? I don't know. So how can I ask the question? Only thing I can do is say, I trust that you

51:59.360 --> 52:06.240
may know what I should be asking you, because you know the world. And I'm just little on me.

52:06.240 --> 52:11.520
And I'm willing to tell you about myself. That's the mind digitization. I'll tell you what I know

52:11.520 --> 52:16.960
and I don't know how I see the world. And you tell me what I should know to make my life better

52:18.080 --> 52:22.880
and to make my children's lives better. That's the ultimate thing. And I think that reversal

52:23.600 --> 52:29.040
of roles where the AI can take the lead is the big transformative thing. That's what takes us

52:29.040 --> 52:36.000
again to wire speed. And those are those quantum leaps and capabilities, not our ability to type

52:36.080 --> 52:44.080
faster. That's true. Yeah. And also like that AI can coach us can be like the life guide as well

52:44.080 --> 52:50.160
once they learn everything about us, not just for the relationship aspect. Wow. Okay. I won't be

52:50.160 --> 52:54.080
respectful of your time. So I know we've got a few minutes left. I'm just gonna rapid fire these

52:54.080 --> 52:58.400
three because I think they'll be really interesting. Like if you were to lose everything tomorrow,

52:58.400 --> 53:03.680
like what would you what would you rebuild aside from aside from UAI? You mean in business?

53:04.080 --> 53:09.440
Could be business or could be everything where you're like, oh, sorry, for business. Let's say

53:09.440 --> 53:13.440
for business. That's right. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, not not. Yeah, just business. Yeah,

53:13.440 --> 53:18.080
let's get in business. Yeah. If I was to lose everything in business, what would I build?

53:20.400 --> 53:24.720
Again, if I maintain sort of the same state of mind that I have now, and I looked at opportunities

53:24.720 --> 53:32.320
where would opportunity be, I would instantly start launching AIs. Now again, some people would

53:32.400 --> 53:35.840
look at this and say, okay, well, he's building a damn platform. He's just promoting it. He's

53:35.840 --> 53:39.760
biased. And I respect that. But I'm telling you, like as much as I can strip that away,

53:40.400 --> 53:46.560
that's what I would do because this is obviously the growth area. This is obviously green field.

53:46.560 --> 53:52.560
I wouldn't go and build like mobile apps, almost 3 million in each app store, that thing is saturated.

53:52.560 --> 53:58.320
I wouldn't go and try to do like drop shipping and affiliate programs and any of that stuff.

53:58.320 --> 54:03.520
That doesn't make sense. If I wanted to build a business, I would go and leverage all of the

54:03.520 --> 54:10.720
power of AI and I would build things for the world that the world needed. And then depends on

54:11.920 --> 54:19.280
what I address, consumery things or SMB things or enterprise things or medical or whatever,

54:20.160 --> 54:26.560
depends. I tend to like consumery things rather than, I mean, I built an enterprise

54:26.560 --> 54:30.800
software company, Aconics, the cybersecurity company, raised 34 million for it, spent five

54:30.800 --> 54:36.400
years of fidget. So I know enterprise. I don't much enjoy building enterprise products. So I

54:36.400 --> 54:41.040
probably do consumery things. Very cool. And then what's the single, what would you say

54:41.040 --> 54:44.560
with the single greatest lesson you've learned so far in life, if you were to pick one?

54:44.560 --> 54:58.080
That I, like you, am an instance of the universe and that we are as connected to one another as

54:58.080 --> 55:04.240
my fingers are connected on my hand, that this is not a finger that's different from this finger

55:04.240 --> 55:10.960
and in competition with one another, struggling to get all the resources. So this finger has fewer

55:10.960 --> 55:17.840
resources. If you do that, your hand dies and that we, all of us, including the animals and the

55:17.840 --> 55:23.040
plants and all of us are instances of one thing you can call it God, you can call it nature,

55:23.040 --> 55:29.040
you can call it universe. You don't have to call it anything, but that, that, by the way, that I

55:29.040 --> 55:36.400
discovered in my first Burning Man in 2009. And I'm about to go to my 12th Burning Man. Oh, wow.

55:37.280 --> 55:40.640
So I'm leaving tomorrow for my 12th Burning Man with all of my kids

55:41.360 --> 55:48.640
and my family and my parents in law who now this is their seventh year at Burning Man. And so all

55:48.640 --> 55:53.520
of that came from that. So I think that would, that's the most profound thing that I learned when

55:53.520 --> 55:58.560
I was 40. And that changed my life. That also is the thing that made me want to have children,

55:59.360 --> 56:04.560
you know, until my 40s. I didn't think I wanted children. I shouldn't populate the world and

56:04.560 --> 56:11.760
any of that. But now I realize that it's a, the world is a wonderful place, not a place,

56:13.360 --> 56:19.280
thing that keeps happening. And I'm part of it. And my job is to participate.

56:20.160 --> 56:24.720
I love that. I love that. That could have been, could have been well put. And then obviously,

56:24.720 --> 56:28.880
big lesson to go to Burning Man, especially if you've done it 17 times is it?

56:29.840 --> 56:34.640
Sorry, 12. Oh, 12. Wow. Okay. So that's, okay. So I'm going to sign my own

56:34.640 --> 56:39.440
register for it in the next one. I don't think I can go for tomorrow, but yeah, that's, that's

56:39.440 --> 56:45.280
amazing. Well, okay, Demetri, this is honestly, it was more than I expected in terms of like mind

56:45.280 --> 56:50.960
blowing, like insights and stuff. I learned a lot, really appreciate you. I think that like,

56:50.960 --> 56:55.760
in the middle part where you talked about like the YouTube and then they released like the thing,

56:55.760 --> 57:00.080
and then there was the deeper, profound lessons. So I'm definitely going to re-listen to this myself,

57:00.080 --> 57:04.000
because I think that we covered a lot of things and we went like deeper. And I love that you've got

57:04.000 --> 57:10.000
the personal like philosophical and like deeper level thinking. And I'm sure that's like, that's

57:10.000 --> 57:14.640
how you always operate. But it's just like, it's just great to hear that. And then not just talk

57:14.640 --> 57:21.120
about like the, the technical aspect, but getting more grounded as well. It's basically, I think,

57:21.120 --> 57:26.000
I was thinking about the title of this episode, speaking to a brilliant mind. Like that's what

57:26.000 --> 57:29.680
came to my mind. So something like that, speaking to a brilliant mind, but then going into more

57:29.680 --> 57:33.920
deep depth of like UAI. And it obviously like will come with something interesting for the titles

57:33.920 --> 57:38.960
and stuff. And there was a lot of great clips and content there for sure. Appreciate it. It was a

57:38.960 --> 57:44.160
lot of fun. Yeah, I had a great time chatting. Thanks for wanting me to, to spend time with you.

57:44.160 --> 57:50.080
It was a pleasure. Yeah, likewise. Any questions, thoughts or anything before we wrap up?

57:50.080 --> 57:57.680
Yeah, excited to that we're connected. I'm excited that I you clearly understood what I said,

57:57.680 --> 58:03.600
that's awesome. And now that you've understood it, I think what I've done is I've planted that

58:03.600 --> 58:09.760
seed in your mind that you can now help me spread the word. Yes, this is what people should be doing.

58:09.760 --> 58:16.240
Like this is the new I'm certain this is the you want to side hustle, this is the new side hustle,

58:16.240 --> 58:20.800
you want to build a business. This is the place to build a business. There's no point trying to go

58:20.800 --> 58:24.560
and raise venture capital and build this big company to build a business that doesn't make

58:24.560 --> 58:29.120
any sense in this environment. We had to build a business to solve a problem, leverage the power

58:29.120 --> 58:34.320
of AI to solve a problem and put a price on it. And then solve another problem tomorrow and another

58:34.320 --> 58:40.000
problem the next day. When you solve a whole collection of problems, you get massively rich.

58:40.000 --> 58:46.160
You've done great work to help the world be better. You've leveraged all the power of AI is those AI

58:46.720 --> 58:52.880
get better, your AI gets better. Because behind the scenes, it's always using all of those models.

58:53.680 --> 58:59.120
Yeah, you're never stagnant. You're never, you're never stuck. You don't have to upgrade anything.

59:00.560 --> 59:04.800
Open the eyes can upgrade things. Anthropics can upgrade things. You know, Facebook's gonna

59:04.800 --> 59:10.480
upgrade things. And as those things get upgraded, your AI continues to get better. I don't know of a

59:10.480 --> 59:20.960
more clear entrepreneurial path. Exclamation point. There we go. Awesome. Thanks again, Dimitri.

59:20.960 --> 59:28.640
Have a safe flight and enjoy the 12th Burning Man. Thanks. Yeah, so 16 hour drive. No flights.

59:28.640 --> 59:33.760
Yeah, 16 hour drive and then another probably eight hours sitting at the gate to get in and then

59:33.760 --> 59:40.400
you got to set everything up. It's not a vacation of any sorts. It's a it's a bit of a sort of going

59:40.400 --> 59:47.760
to the moon and doing it. But I love it. I find it I find it powerful. Yeah. Amazing. Well,

59:47.760 --> 59:52.560
thanks so much. Have a great weekend. Appreciate you. Take care. Thank you. Take care. Bye bye.
