0	6320	And we can use AI as we were just talking to make us radically more efficient at communicating
6320	12880	with one another because communication can be radically better and alignment can be radically
12880	16800	better and disambiguation can be radically better. People say words other people hear
16800	21360	something else or they project something else onto it. Something needs to help us communicate
21360	27520	with one another. And AI is going to do that. Mind indexing plus AI does just that.
35600	39280	Welcome to the Cave Minds podcast. Welcome to the Cave Minds podcast here. We are we got an
39280	46080	exciting guest today, Dimitri Shapiro. And he is the co-founder CEO of UAI. And he's got a pretty
46080	50960	extensive background. And I'm excited to kind of share that through with everybody. So Dimitri
50960	55760	aside from being the co-founder CEO of UAI and Koji, another company, he's also the founder
55760	62480	CEO of Go Meta Inc. based in San Diego. And Dimitri, feel free to jump in at any point if I'm not
62480	67680	not reading this right. But before this, he created the video sharing site Veo, which I've
67680	76480	everyone has used back in 2005. And then he served as a CTO at MySpace, which is one of the most
76560	80640	epic companies that everyone used back in the day. And then before moving on to Google,
81360	86320	where he took up a role of Group Product Manager. And then after that, Dimitri left Google to
86320	91200	found Go Meta. And then he has a bachelor's in electrical engineering from the Georgia
91200	97120	Institute of Technology. Is that is that pretty good, Dimitri? I think it hits a bunch of points.
97120	104960	I'm not sure if that it's in the right order. But that's all right. It's complicated. Yeah. So
104960	110960	the way I describe myself these days is I'm an old nerd. I started writing code in 1984 when I was
110960	116480	in high school. I studied electrical engineering and got a degree, but I've never done a day of it.
116480	123440	I've always done software. I most recently before finding Go Meta, which is the company that owns
123440	131200	Koji and owns UAI. So these are two platforms that Go Meta Inc. the holding company owns.
131200	139040	And I'm CEO of Go Meta Inc. Therefore, you know, CEO of these two platforms Koji and UAI.
139840	145440	Prior to that, I was at Google for four years on the main campus for the first three years. I ran
145440	150720	three machine learning teams, a product for three machine learning teams that were crunching a bunch
150720	155600	of implicit signals that Google had. Prior to that, I was CTO of Myspace. And then prior to that,
155600	161600	I founded two other venture-backed companies. One was a major competitor to YouTube called Vio
161600	166160	Networks, which is the one you mentioned. And then I also built a venture-backed cybersecurity
166160	171520	company, enterprise software cybersecurity company called Aconics Systems, raised 34 million for
171520	179360	that, raised 70 million for Vio. And then before both of those for five years from 95 to 99,
179440	184800	I built the web team at Fujitsu, which is, you know, giant Japanese company. And so,
185440	190000	as I said, I'm just an old nerd. You've been around, definitely. I mean, that's a lot of
190000	193280	experience there. And then I think, like, they read the story, like, I think total,
193840	197760	roughly, I think you've raised over 140 million venture capital from various companies.
199040	203120	Okay. So let's jump into it. Because then, you know, our main topic here is like, we at Cavemines,
203120	209440	we've got thousands of founders from networks like EO, YPO, Vistage, and a lot of startup grind.
209440	213600	It's a wide commonator people. And then I think our main thing is that we want to bring on AI
213600	218000	leaders. And that's why we have you here today. It's like people that have done it, been there,
218000	222160	and are still doing it today, and just like building stuff within AI, even beyond that,
222160	227680	like real AI, and then sharing the practical applications and like what they need to consider,
227680	231120	and just shedding more light, because I've been having conversations with a lot of these founders
231120	236000	that have built businesses, but in like outside of AI, and then if they're non-technical, they're
236000	241760	all overwhelmed, like they don't know what's happening. They see all these tools, you know,
241760	245520	they're using chat GPD, they're prompting, but they really don't know what they don't know.
245520	249840	And, you know, they kind of stick to the lane. So and I think like that's one of the things when
249840	255120	I was checking on you AI was like, wow, like you've simplified the ability to allow people,
255120	260080	developers or even founders to go on and build an app within AI that they can actually start,
260080	263920	like then releasing it and launching it. It's almost like you're creating like the AI app marketplace,
263920	269200	essentially, especially, yeah, exactly there, and Mind Studio, especially to allow them to build in
269200	274000	with it. And everything I like about UAI for all of you listeners, like, check it out, go on there,
274000	278800	because you can go on there and you can actually see what is what is currently available, and it's
278800	284080	all laid out in a very simple way. So there's no complex jargon or like text and stuff for you to
284080	287600	like complicate and overwhelm me like other AI things. It's like really simple and easy to
287600	292400	understand, which is not easy to do, especially to distill that information.
292400	298080	Always making it a little bit crisper and tighter and constantly working on messaging,
298080	302080	because these are complex things to describe to people. This is new to
303200	308480	everyone. You know, I mean, I've been working with machine learning since 2006, when we started
308480	314640	using it at VO, again, it's a YouTube competitor, we actually had recommendations, video recommendations
314640	320480	before YouTube had them. My chief scientist at that time was Dr. Ted Dunning, who's a sort of
320480	326160	world-renowned expert in collaborative filtering, which is a sort of a form of machine learning,
326160	331040	not exactly machine learning, but used for similar things, you know, prior generations
331040	338720	version of machine learning. So anyway, so yeah, I appreciate the compliment and I sympathize with
338720	346560	founders who are trying to build companies in this environment. Again, this is my third
346560	352560	venture-backed company. I've now been doing this one for seven years, the other two or five years
352560	363200	each. So there you go, 17 years of this. And I think this is the most interesting time, meaning
363200	370720	has many variables that must be considered that didn't exist in sort of my prior experience.
370720	375200	Things used to feel relatively stable. I mean, you kind of knew what the floor was that you were
375200	379440	building on, what the ground was what you were building on. Now the ground is sort of moving
379440	386720	quite a bit. And everybody's struggling with it from founders to venture capitalists who also
386720	391680	sort of don't know how to invest in this kind of an environment, because things that they're
391680	396240	doing due diligence on this week, we're going to get disrupted later on this week.
396240	397200	It's moving so fast.
397200	401280	And then you start doing due diligence on that, and that gets disrupted. And you do that a few
401280	405520	times. And all of a sudden they're like, well, it seems everything's about to get disrupted
405520	409840	over and over again. How can we invest? And so I have a lot of friends that are venture
409840	414160	capitalists that are sort of struggling, trying to figure out how do I do my job
415040	419280	and in this kind of environment. So it's a difficult environment for everyone.
419680	428160	But I believe, I think, certainly, that this is the best environment for new entrepreneurs
428720	437680	to jump in and build companies. What AI, specifically generative AI, has brought to the
437680	444560	table is the ability to build products much faster, like orders of magnitude faster,
445120	453760	and with a lot less technical capabilities required from a human resource standpoint.
454640	462720	You've seen large language models writing code. You've seen large language models responding
462720	470480	to prompts that if those responses would have been somehow written in something other than
470560	475760	a large language model, some kind of a heuristic approach, that would have been a lot of software
475760	479600	development and a lot of data crunching to be able to give these kinds of responses.
479600	485600	They come in a sense for free instantaneously. So those dynamics have changed dramatically of how
485600	492000	quickly one can bring a new product to market. And we're sort of in the thick of things with
492000	499680	UAI Mines Studio, to your point, which is someone can show up with an idea. And then in less than
499680	507440	an hour, launch a product that leverages all of the power of chat GPT and Anthropics Clawed,
507440	515040	we're Model Agnostic, so we support today GPT 33540, and also Clawed 1 and 2, so we'll support
515040	519840	all the other models as well. And so you can sort of leverage the power of all of those in less than
519840	526640	an hour, build a new service that you can launch on the internet, including monetization, that you
526640	531200	ask people to give it a free tier and ask people to pay a subscription fee for it.
532240	537600	And we now have over a thousand of these services that have been launched. This is the last month
537600	543040	and a half since we announced Mines Studio. And I think a lot of them are like really profound,
543040	550240	like, you know, people are building an AI medic. So basically like a physician that you can chat
550240	555600	with and it'll diagnose your symptoms. There's also an AI vet. So if your pet is having symptoms,
555600	561120	you can diagnose it. There's gardening assistance. If you want to plant tomatoes in San Diego where
561120	566000	I live, this gardening assistant knows where you live and will tell you the exact time to plant
566000	569520	tomatoes because if you're living in Northern California, this is the wrong time. You've got
569520	574560	a different time. You're in a different zone, right? Or a parenting co-pilot. I have five kids.
576160	580240	You could try to read all the books in the world. I don't have time to read any books.
580240	586240	But I have on my phone a parenting assistant that's read every book. That's read every study.
587280	592560	Because behind the scenes, it's just GPT-4. And it simply asks me what's happening.
593120	597280	And it knows about my kids because I've already trained it. And that took two minutes less
597840	603120	to train it. And so I can say, Una is crying because Diego won't go to sleep. And this thing
603120	608080	knows that Diego is older and Una is younger and can tell me exactly what to say to Una,
608080	614160	exactly what to say to Diego, how to frame any of it. And there's over a thousand more of those.
614160	617360	Wow, that's interesting. Okay, that's super helpful because then I just realized I was playing
617360	622240	around with it. And then I think that, yeah, like parenting is one use case and there's thousands
622240	626000	of use cases there. But I think that like, if I can pop in and use it, because the difference that
626000	630800	using GPT-4, you got to like heavily prompt and you got to do a new chat every time. But this is
630800	635920	fully trained in that specific use case and it retains everything. And I think there's no limits
635920	640480	as far as I know. I haven't reached any limits yet using it in terms of like, prompting. Like,
640480	646400	it's like, I think, correct me. Other than context windows and standard things that are limits of
646400	652960	modern LLMs, there are no limits. Because again, behind the scenes, think of us as like an abstraction
652960	659600	layer, like the application abstraction layer, two large language models. Basically, we believe,
659600	663920	which is what you're pointing at, that it doesn't make sense for consumers, for regular people,
664000	671920	to go directly to chat GPT and start typing. You know, you are a blog writing assistant
672800	677200	that has 40 years of experience and like all these things people write, please,
677920	683280	I will give you examples, backspace, backspace. This doesn't make any sense. We believe AI should
683280	687920	work the same way as mobile apps work, meaning there's an app for that. You want to write a
687920	692960	blog post, you push the right blog post button, you want help with parenting, you push the parenting
692960	701120	co-pilot button. And so prompt engineers, people who like, who are nerds like us, who want to go
701120	707280	and craft those prompts and experiment and tune them up in Nuancem, those people should do the work
707280	714480	to create that and package it using Mind Studio, package those prompts as consumer accessible
714480	720000	AIs. And so we're basically just a prompt package. But it's more than prompt. It's prompt and system
720000	725840	message and preamble and various parameters of, you know, large language models, temperature and
725840	731440	dealing with context windows and overflows and summarizations. Like a lot of things there that
731440	738080	we allow you as a prompt engineer to tune so that the consumer can simply answer the question,
738080	741680	what do you want to write the blog post about and now paste a sample of your writing style.
741680	745600	They only need to do that once, paste a sample of their writing style. From then on, they've
745600	750960	trained their own personalized blog post writer. And from then on, all they have to do is say,
750960	756080	I'm going to write a blog post of how, you know, AI is going to disrupt medicine. And it says,
756080	762480	who's the audience? And you might say physicians who are concerned about AI displacing them, great,
762480	768160	this thing is going to write a blog post in your writing style towards physicians that are concerned.
768720	774800	How many words would a consumer have to write in order to set up ChatGPT to be able to do that?
774800	778240	I think that's really cool because then my mind is kind of racing out because I think that I don't
778240	781440	know if maybe this is already released. Maybe it's not correct me if I'm wrong, but like
782320	787920	what if like, let's say the top five to 10 parent blogging apps or any of the categories there.
787920	791360	And then they're like, okay, instead of us building this whole conversation of Chatbot using
791920	797920	ABCD app, I want to just integrate the parenting app on UAI into our website. And then they pay,
798880	802320	like they don't pay the consumer rate, but they pay like a business. Is that already available?
802320	808160	Or is that something that's still in the works? Yeah, you can take, if you have content of your own,
808720	812720	let's say you're a parenting blogger and you've got a bunch of your blog posts and so,
812720	819680	in a sense, you can, your, your mental models are digitized. You've written a content. There it is.
820320	825920	You can take MindStudio, our product, and you can take that content and integrate it
826640	834560	into a URL that is a Chatbot and embed that on your blog or post it as a Instagram story. It's
834560	842960	just a link. Share it anywhere on social media, post it to Twitter, I guess X. And, and yeah,
842960	847440	so it's like really easy to do. And then you want to charge for it. Oh, wait, so the businesses
847440	851760	where they don't pay for, they pay for the usage of it, meaning that like if they have a thousand
851840	856400	visitors visiting the site and then they all 1000 use the app through their business website
856400	862480	or through their blog. No, no, the way it's set up is that you as prompt engineer can show up,
862480	869120	create a free account, start, you know, say, create new AI, we give you a bunch of templates you can
869120	876640	use or you can use blank and make that AI again, typically takes a few minutes to an hour, maybe
876640	881200	depends on like how much you want to geek out to really tune it up and make it awesome. But
881760	885920	not huge amounts of time, including integrating your own data and all of that. And then when you
885920	890320	publish it, that asks you to fill out some information. What do you want to call it? You
890320	894560	know, give it an icon, give it like a sharing image. And then there's a section says, do you want to
894560	900960	make it free to consumers to use? Or do you want to charge a subscription fee? You want to charge
900960	907120	a subscription fee for me to use your AI as a consumer, I get a free tier, which typically,
907120	913200	you know, I think 15 messages. And then it prompts me to give you money, depending on how
913200	917120	much you've said you want to charge. Some people are charging dollars, some people are charging
917120	924880	50 bucks a month. Again, we just launched payments the late last week before last, so like 10 days
924880	930720	ago. And there are already people who have subscribers and making money, you know, so it's
931280	939440	in the teens, not even 100, but still like the thing works. And people are starting to generate
939440	946720	recurring revenue monthly subscribers for their hard work of doing prompt engineering, you know,
946720	952320	figuring out what prompts work the right way and tuning all the other parameters and setting it
952320	957600	out. This use cases them every blog, every any business really e-commerce, the world I come
957680	963280	from like can definitely utilize building a specific app on it, putting it on as an embed
963280	967920	somewhere or even on a page and being like, hey, like get like a customer AI chat bot with our
967920	972400	thing. Or you can add them to home screens on mobile phones, right, because they're just web
972400	976640	apps, you can bookmark them and add them to home screens, they're there. Again, we see people sharing
976640	980640	them social media, that's an awesome channel to be able to do it because they'll render inside of
980640	985200	a Facebook feed. Because they, you know, Facebook thinks of them as like articles. And so you get
985280	989760	the open graph image in description and people can just tap on it or click on it and instantly get
989760	995120	access to this AI inside of Instagram or Facebook or Twitter or anywhere else. Oh, wow. Okay. Very
995120	1000960	cool. And by the way, your point of like use cases, this is going to be just like the mobile app store,
1000960	1006160	meaning what kind of apps are in the mobile app stores, over 2 million apps in each app store,
1006160	1012640	apps for everything. There's an app for that. This is the same way. There should be an AI for that.
1013600	1019520	Today, the AI for that is chat GPT. I have to go there and tell chat GPT to behave as some AI for
1019520	1024880	that that we just discussed. But really what we should do is treat chat GPT as like raw material.
1025520	1030720	And we prompt engineers take all that raw material and make out of it specific things for specific
1030720	1036800	use cases that are much faster and easier for people to use consumers and SMBs and enterprises.
1037760	1045760	The scope is infinite. It is. I think like, and that like is current product as of today. And
1045760	1049200	like, what is what do you think is long term vision? What's the vision that you have like long
1049200	1052640	term that you can share like, you know, publicly, I'm sure there's a lot of things happening behind
1052640	1063520	the scenes. But yeah, I tend to be an open book. So I'll happily share. Yeah, so there's there's
1064080	1070080	near term work that we're doing. And then there's a longer term vision that we believe in
1070880	1079200	that we've already experimented with, meaning we put it into alpha and got data to show us that
1079200	1086080	we are right. But that this is viable. I'll explain both of these to you. So there's the near term
1086080	1092560	thing, which is mine studio. And so again, we believe that already these large language models
1092640	1097680	and image diffusion models and video models that are coming out, all of these generative models
1097680	1104560	are incredible, have countless literally countless use cases. But that the interface today that's
1104560	1111920	provided to consumers, this sort of chatbot interface cannot be the right interface. You
1111920	1117360	know, those of us that are old enough to remember DOS before there was Windows. DOS was generally
1117360	1123920	unusable. It wasn't until we got Windows that computing took off. And this is the same thing
1123920	1129360	we believe. And so while it's extraordinarily powerful, and it's amazing that people think that
1129360	1134480	they need to become prompt engineers to be able to sort of live in this new world of leveraging AI,
1134480	1139360	we don't believe that's true. We believe we prompt engineers, let's call ourselves people that are
1139360	1146400	motivated to do this work should show up right now, use mine studio, and basically build out
1146480	1152320	every use case possible. And you can do that now, you don't need any programming experience,
1152320	1156480	there's no code to this, you need to be able to use language while though, you need to be able
1156480	1162400	to be articulate, you have to explain, but that's what prompt writing is to be able to explain clearly
1163280	1168000	what you want the thing to do. And so that is a skill that you should have, but you can show up
1168000	1172480	now and do it. So that's the near term. And so we're making mine studio more powerful. So in it,
1172480	1176560	for example, is something called automations, where you can do these like multi step workflows,
1176560	1181680	you can collect input from a user, you know, during during their sessions, including, you know,
1181680	1186400	long term memory. So this thing remembers. So when they come back next week or next year,
1186400	1190880	this thing knows about them. So it's really, really powerful. Yeah, I don't have to constantly
1190880	1195200	start up from scratch and and type. Yeah, that's the biggest challenge. And so we're expanding
1195200	1202160	automation section, quite dramatically, we are making the sort of the output product itself
1202160	1209040	the AI are creating better interfaces for it. So it's sort of more usable by consumers and
1209040	1218000	and simpler to configure. We are adding analytics, deep analytics for AI creators to be able to
1218000	1223520	understand how people are using their AI so they can take it and make better AI's and make new AI's
1223520	1227840	and all of that. So there's a lot of work that's being done right now. You'll see a lot of releases
1227840	1234720	coming from us in the mind studio realm, again, focused on creators of AI's these,
1234720	1238800	let's call them prompt engineers for them, and for consumers that are engaging with those,
1238800	1245200	that's one piece. Another piece is we run a directory called UAI UAI dot AI. And there you
1245200	1250160	can go and find again, over 1000 of these AI's already. So think of it as like an app store
1250960	1258400	for AI's, you can go and browse categories or search and find interesting tools, AI tools you
1258400	1263040	can use and simply use them. And you know, the favorite section and you get again, as I said,
1263040	1266400	you can just add them to your home screen and there you go. So we're going to make that better.
1266400	1270720	Right now, discovery is dumb. There's some editorial that we do. There's nothing personalized.
1270720	1275360	There's nothing algorithmic. But there's already a lot of like really powerful interesting stuff.
1275360	1279200	And still invest some resources and discovery that's there. That's in the near term,
1280080	1285040	longer term. Oh, by the way, look, this is the when I say near term, like this is certainly
1285040	1292240	the next year, and probably next two years, as we're here. Because this opportunity is giant
1293280	1298160	for there to be an app store for AI's and for all prompt engineers of the world
1298160	1304080	to show up and sort of plant their flag and build all build out all of these services and
1304160	1309280	then benefit from that by making a living doing it rather. We think again, another way to put it
1309280	1314640	is if you want to start a new company, start it on you on on Mind Studio started on UAI Mind Studio.
1315440	1319760	Show up, build an AI, say I want to make money from it monetize it. And there you go, you just
1319760	1324160	launch the company. Later on today, you can watch another company being another product,
1324160	1329600	probably one company, but another product, one was a AI medic, another one's an AI vet.
1330560	1336160	Same thing sort of like you didn't have to do any work other than tell GPT that it's now a vet
1336160	1341120	versus it's now a human medic. That's interesting. Everything else is reusable. And also, as you're
1341120	1345520	talking about the short term time, short term side, one of the things I was thinking about was,
1345520	1350160	let's say there's like 100 bed apps over the period of time, how do you navigate that from
1350160	1354400	the consumer side? Business side doesn't affect it. But yeah, I mean, same way you do it in the
1354480	1359120	App Store. How many calendars are there? How many calendars are there in the App Store? How many
1359120	1365040	productivity apps are the countless of anything? And so you have ranking, right? And you have reviews,
1365680	1371120	and you have usage stats. And you basically, it's a ranking problem. Okay. And then there's
1371120	1375360	something that you'll build in like in the near term, we're doing that now. Yeah, that's one of
1375360	1379200	the things that we're doing that because we already have, as I said, over 1000 ai's last week,
1379200	1383280	there's over 100 created to accelerating. Yeah. And it makes sense because it's like easy to go on
1383280	1388480	and hop on a build. Is there, do you have something to think about when it comes to like audio, like
1388480	1393520	voice, the conversational within these apps? That would be interesting. Like instead of text,
1393520	1399440	it's like, you can speak to that app. I mean, in a sense, you can speak to that because built into
1399440	1405200	every desktop or mobile operating system now is, you know, voice to text capabilities, right? So
1405200	1409360	you got a little microphone next to messenger. Oh, okay. You can just speak to wherever there's
1409360	1414880	text input, we already have the way to take voice and trans transcode into text, basically.
1415440	1420720	Yeah. So we don't have to build that. I thought where you were going is there are absolutely
1423120	1431200	sound generation models that are starting to be available and meaningful. And also, you know,
1432160	1436000	sort of music generation and speech generation is part of that.
1437200	1444640	Where you can do sort of automated generation of audio. Today, we don't have any of those,
1444640	1450400	but we absolutely will, because as I mentioned, we're completely model agnostic. And so we will
1450400	1456720	support all major language models and diffusion models and video and audio and all of that.
1456720	1461200	I was just thinking like how I would probably use it is I would just put you AI as the actual thing
1461200	1466320	saved on my phone on my iPhone and just click on it and then use it as like, I can navigate and
1466320	1471200	search everything also saving like specific apps as well. Because then I would be able to just like
1471200	1475360	get access to everything in one go. And then I could find things. Yeah. Yeah. Like, I mean,
1475360	1479680	I think I saw you posting things about prompts, right? Like, so I see people saying, Hey, I've got
1479680	1486160	this like notion, you know, a sheet or I've got, I've got a spreadsheet that's got all these prompts.
1486160	1490960	And you can just go find the right prompt and copy and paste it into chat GPT and do that. We
1490960	1496640	think that's a silly way of doing things. If you've got a good prompt, turn it into an AI.
1497760	1502320	So I as a consumer can just pick it and bookmark it and just use it whenever I want.
1502320	1506000	Why should I have to go and open up a spreadsheet and copy and paste things
1506640	1510400	into chat GPT? How does that make sense? Yeah, it's just inefficient. And even right now,
1510400	1514640	like anytime we and the biggest thing is that it forgets. And if you delete it or you lose it,
1514720	1519120	yeah, it's just everything. But I do like that the fact that you're agnostic is in you integrate
1519120	1524560	all these other LLMs and API's and stuff. And then I don't have to manually go to five because
1524560	1528400	right now what we're doing is like, even as like us trying to utilize different platforms,
1528400	1532560	we're going to multiple different ones, try to link it together. And it just takes way more
1532560	1537600	time than it's necessary, which versus I can just use that one, go to you and then be able to
1537600	1541600	integrate. Hey, I want to use these anthropic or use like open AI or something like that.
1542240	1544560	Totally. Okay, yeah, interesting. We support those now.
1545520	1549600	Yeah, that makes sense. And then okay, so in the going back to long term, like do you in like
1549600	1553200	five to 10 years, I guess, like, where do you where do you kind of see that like some that
1553200	1559120	that's what's interesting? Yeah, so that is the long term piece that I want to tell you about. So
1560400	1568560	in May, so just a few months ago, we launched an alpha of UAI. This is before we had Mind Studio.
1568560	1575600	Mind Studio sort of came out of UAI. And our our vision there that we articulated to people and
1575600	1582480	said, please come and play with it if you want is this, that the right way to truly leverage
1583920	1592320	all the power of modern information technology, meaning that continues to accelerate, we have
1592320	1597040	Google, which by the way behind the scenes is all machine learning output that's not seen as an AI
1597040	1601920	platform, but it's absolutely an AI platform, or YouTube or any of these things are all behind
1601920	1607600	the scenes driven by machine learning. That's why they are so good. But but now we have these
1607600	1612320	new generative models, and all of that is just accelerating faster and faster and faster. And
1612320	1618640	so the thing that we pointed out is that we believe that humans are the bottleneck already
1619200	1624160	in being able to leverage all of the power of information technology, meaning I'll get you
1624160	1630080	like this, there are countless mobile apps I could be using right now that would make me better,
1630080	1637520	smarter, faster, happier, etc. I have no time to go find them, set them up, learn to use them and
1637520	1644080	use them. I am the bottleneck. The technology exists, but I'm the bottleneck. All of these new
1644080	1650480	large language models are really sort of exacerbating that and making it clear that human beings are
1650480	1655280	the bottleneck in being able to leverage all the power. This is why things like auto GPT are
1655280	1660640	exciting because you take the human out of the loop all of a sudden you have wire speed AI. Well,
1660640	1666160	now we're talking. It's not guided very well. So we believe that the real problem is the problem
1666720	1674240	of human to digital interface. And today it's gotten even worse because we said that the interface is
1674240	1680160	a chat box, which is one of the worst interfaces to it. We believe the right interface to that
1680240	1686640	is to take our minds, all of these beliefs, biases, mental constructs, desires, all those things in
1686640	1694080	our minds and digitize them, turn them into a data set. So we can then take that data set and grant
1694080	1701600	it to AI, which by the way, these are all neural networks. They don't want prompts. They want data
1701680	1711200	sets. Their core thing that they do is they take data sets and they process them and they find
1711200	1717520	structure in them, where structure may not have been seen by humans or was seen, but they're
1717520	1722480	much better at doing it. Statistically, meaningful features. That's what these things do. And so
1722480	1728000	if we digitize our minds somehow, and I'll explain to you how we did it that works, you can play with
1728000	1733840	it, then you get a data set of your mind and you can simply give that to AI and AI can sort of look
1733840	1738800	and say, uh-huh, I grok you. I understand how you're different from this person or different from the
1738800	1743600	majority or whatever. I understand what your strengths are. I understand what your weaknesses are. I
1743600	1747840	understand what your gaps of knowledge are. I understand what your desires are. And then I,
1748720	1754080	the AI, can take the lead and say, you don't need to prompt me anymore. Let me take the lead and make
1754160	1759200	proposals for you. I think you might like this. Do you like it? And you say, yes, please do that.
1759200	1763920	Thank you. I got you. What about this? I thought you might want to learn this. I've created a custom
1764720	1768800	learning material for you because I thought that you understood prompt engineering,
1768800	1772800	but it seemed you didn't understand this dimension of prompt engineering. And so I filled that in
1772800	1777840	for you. Here it is. Just that. Instead of giving you more things to read about prompt engineering.
1777840	1783920	And so anyway, so we believe that's the future of human beings being able to leverage all of the
1783920	1790720	accelerating power of information technology is to for us not to interface with this technology
1790720	1796720	directly, but for us to, in a sense, interface with this proxy, this mind indexing proxy.
1796720	1801680	And because our minds are constantly changing, this is something that we do from now on. And by
1801680	1808240	the way, what does it feel like? It feels like TikTok. It feels like a never ending feed of
1808240	1814320	proposals and interfaces that we present to human and say, how would you choose? Some are
1814320	1820240	open answer questions. Some are multiple choice questions. Some are high density grids that say,
1820240	1826880	tap all the things that seem yummy. How would you describe yummy to chat GPT in words if you
1826880	1832400	wanted to recommend food choices for you? That take a lot of words. It would be very crude.
1833040	1838160	But if I give you just a few screens of high density screens of images and say,
1838160	1844560	pick the things that seem yummy, I can build a vector that differentiates you from me or from
1844560	1852800	other people. You see? And so we announced this. We had over 5,000 people show up in our alpha
1853520	1859840	and go through a median number of prompts. We call them prompts that we presented to them
1859840	1868000	answered as 177. So 177 explicitly articulated data points. And by the way, the reason it was,
1868000	1872320	you know, on one hand, that's extraordinarily high. On the other hand, that's limited because we only
1872320	1878880	had a limited number of prompts in there. And so people ran out of things to answer. And we paused
1878880	1885440	it for a moment, well, moment, maybe for a little bit of time, because we realized from that that
1885600	1891920	that is going to work. Like we could really go in that and digitize people's minds. But for what?
1891920	1896800	What are they going to get for that in the near term? That's where Mind Studio comes in.
1897920	1902800	What they get for that is all of these AIs that are being built right now with Mind Studio can
1902800	1911520	leverage all of that data that's being collected by Mind Indexing. You can grant it. You can grant
1911520	1918000	any new AI you discover. It can ask you, can I use this set of data about you? And you can say yes.
1918640	1920800	And it's instantly trained, personalized to you.
1920800	1926240	You're essentially like, it's like a close thing to like digital, digitizing one's mind and also
1926240	1932560	like replicating them. You know, a lot of good points. I guess like, I can tell you philosophical
1932560	1936160	as well, like, what do you think are the philosophical implications of this, like the
1936160	1941520	digitization of one's mind and removing someone to fully, I guess, quote unquote,
1941520	1946720	build a fully AI-powered experience where the human isn't getting involved in each step and like
1946720	1953520	all that stuff that's currently the state of AI? Yeah, I think, I mean, it's a brave new world,
1953520	1959600	like it's profoundly transformative. First of all, obviously the speed of ability for a human
1959600	1969760	to communicate with machine becomes many orders of magnitude faster. So that itself is profound.
1969760	1973760	The ability and one of, I think one of the biggest problems humans have is we don't know what we
1973760	1982160	don't know. And this thing can figure out what we don't know and fill in the gaps for us. And so
1982160	1988960	education gets transformed radically. So the pace of education, you know, goes up dramatically.
1989920	1995200	And everyone gets basically personal content delivered to them. It also transforms the web.
1996000	1999680	It doesn't make sense anymore to create websites that are geared towards personas
2000400	2005600	or ideal customer profiles. There is no such thing. These are all crude caricatures. Any
2005600	2010640	person, any marketing team has ever built is a crude caricature of something that doesn't exist.
2010640	2016960	Each person is infinitely complex, individual. So this thing could actually sort of leverage that
2016960	2023440	data where a human shows up to an e-commerce site and says, here's me in data form. An e-commerce
2023440	2028800	site says, I grok you, here are the things that you would like from our catalog of things. Let
2028800	2033120	me explain them to you in the language you will understand how they will matter in your life
2033120	2038080	and why you should choose this over our competitors product. So everything becomes
2038080	2044640	ultra personalized content created on demand for each one of us based upon, again, our states of
2044640	2049120	being. That's the right way it should be. That's the way humans do it. Like if you have a human
2049120	2053840	salesperson, why is a human salesperson better than just a website? Because a human person can
2053840	2060160	have a conversation with the other human and understand them in a more nuanced way and then
2060160	2065600	paraphrase thing to them and leave them from where they are now to where we need them to be.
2066320	2070960	And that can only be done by understanding who is the customer in this case. And by the way,
2070960	2074960	of course, beyond that, you start to get into all kinds of other crazy things, which is when you
2074960	2080720	digitize, again, I've thought about this now for years and so I'll propose some things that to me
2080720	2087920	are quite obvious, but won't be obvious at first blush, which is, so I'm married. My wife and I
2087920	2092800	just celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary. We have five kids. I know her extraordinarily well.
2093520	2098000	But periodically, there are still things that come out in conversation. I'm like,
2098880	2103840	how did I not know this about you? I've had this with Fran, 54 years old. I've had this
2103840	2109840	with friends I've known for 30 years. I'm like, how is it possible that we'd never touched upon
2109840	2115040	that? Or I always assumed you were this or now you're this, right? Well, because I propose to
2115600	2121440	you and the listeners that we know a very thin veneer of one another.
2122240	2128240	Human communication is very shallow. We don't have time to go deep. It's uncomfortable to go deep.
2129840	2135120	Who takes the lead on making things deeper? It's hard to do that. But if we are all indexing
2135120	2139680	our own mind, we can show up at a situation and say, hey, do you want to compare mental models?
2140640	2147280	And then say yes and yes. And all of a sudden, instantly look at that data and realize all of
2147280	2152000	these amazing things that we have in common that we would have never discovered in 40 years of friendship.
2152560	2158160	But now we can see them. We can go deep. We can find misalignment where I thought you believed
2158160	2162000	this, but you actually don't. No wonder we've been miscommunicating or I've been trying to get
2162000	2166000	you to see things in some way. But you can't see them in that way because of this thing. I would
2166000	2170160	have never known that about you. How would I discover that? But because we're digitizing minds,
2170160	2176160	we can overlay and do that. We can also do that in teams, which is profound. I run companies.
2177040	2181280	Running companies is one of the hardest things, mostly in alignment and communication.
2182480	2187520	People say, we agree. We're going in the right direction. I say, I'm not sure that's true. Explain
2187520	2191280	it to me in your own words. And they explain it. I'm like, okay, we're aligned. And then all of a
2191280	2195600	sudden we somehow are moving in different directions. How? Well, because the vector
2195600	2200080	from which we were looking at it, it seemed like we were aligned because we're pointing at a point
2200080	2205520	in space, but we're pointing from different directions. This thing can find misalignment
2206240	2210960	and help us align. So we can work together. So anyway, so like those kinds of things become
2210960	2216480	quite profound and transformative to society. That was honestly like, I don't even know how to
2216480	2220880	describe it. But I think that what you just shared is like, mind blowing, because to me,
2220880	2225360	that changes relationships forever, in the sense that like, if I don't know how it would look like
2225360	2229280	functionally, like tactically, but if what you just described as a concept, if I can just press a
2229280	2233760	button, and then we know everything, and then if they're, and then we can just look at it or maybe
2233760	2237360	scroll through up there, this is like a caveman version of where we're at, but they scroll through
2237360	2242560	like, Oh, Julie or John, we have all these things in common. These are things that we don't want.
2242560	2246480	And it's the things that you didn't know, or you didn't know, or that would actually be,
2246480	2251200	I would love to use that. That would be a very near that we almost launched that.
2253120	2257920	We could in a sense launch it at any week, we're close to being able to launch that we now have
2257920	2264880	over, I think just under 10,000 people who've been digitizing minds, maybe it's now above 10,000,
2264880	2271680	but some are in that range. This is with UAI. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And so we actually, like
2271680	2277520	said, we started, we almost launched that comparison thing. And it's just a mobile interface or desktop
2277520	2282800	interface that says, you know, given these two people, they can both consent, because obviously
2282800	2286720	the information is private consent, and then say, great, okay, let me compare the two of you.
2286720	2290320	And then it comes out and it actually explains it to you and just plain English, like it even
2290320	2294800	does the parsing in the process. Oh, wow. You don't have to just like look at data. I mean,
2294800	2299600	you can look at the raw data too. But like, you can summarize it for you and it can help you grok,
2300560	2306480	you know, how to interact with other humans, like human communications about to change radically.
2306480	2310160	Yes. Because then it changes the way that we not just build a relationship, but it helps us build
2310160	2314880	deeper and more meaningful relationship. Because when we save the time of, because we have limited
2314880	2319680	time. And so like having hours and hours of conversation that we normally have now is meaningful,
2319680	2324000	but it's, it's also there's a level of AI where what you described as a thing that's being built.
2324720	2328800	Yeah, that's really exciting. Actually, I can see I can, I would definitely use that because I was
2328800	2333440	even thinking the other day, and this is just like a in a nutshell version, like we do so many
2333440	2336880	intro calls in business. And then everyone's like, Hey, can we hop on an intro call, intro call? And
2336880	2341440	then like in the lifetime of business, we probably do thousands of intro calls. What if there's a
2341440	2346320	way to literally apply what you just shared into the intro calls? And then, you know, and then we
2346320	2350080	get into kind of like the, Hey, this is the core thing that we can add value to each other in that
2350080	2354800	way. But we save the 30 minutes in one hour, not to say that it's not meaningful, but it's just
2355600	2360160	to focus on building and doing more creative work and whatnot. I think that would be like
2360160	2366400	really interesting as well. And you can instantly go deep. You can skip all the shallow stuff.
2366400	2370400	Again, doesn't mean you don't do shallow stuff. Shallow stuff is interesting, flirting is great.
2370960	2376000	But, but the real value happens in the depths. Yep. In personal relationships and business
2376000	2382240	relationships, the devil is in the details. So get to the details. Because the rest,
2382240	2389520	why should we waste our time talking it? It's much faster to index it, have the AI summarize it
2390960	2397520	and let you guys now move on to the depths. You're both good people. I AI think you should
2397520	2402080	work together. It looks like you're going to fit. Great. Let's get in the depths of it.
2402080	2406640	This is really interesting. What if, since we're riffing on it, like just what if you imagine
2406640	2412800	like that, but then you add in a audio replica version of the person and then that person would,
2413360	2417760	after the matching is done, the audio would be there. And then you, the person that want to
2417760	2422080	interact with them could do, could have a call with the audio version of it. So similar to,
2422080	2426080	I don't know if you've seen, you've probably seen air.ai where it's like an AI version of
2426800	2431200	the person having a conversation. And then let's say they, once they have the conversation,
2431200	2436640	then it goes into that real, real self. So it's like the AI version of you having a conversation
2436640	2440560	with a real person and then it becomes a real person. Yeah. So look, I think a lot, you know,
2440560	2445600	lots of people are doing lots of interesting things. My personal gut feel, take that with a
2445600	2453840	trillion pounds of salt. But my personal opinion is that at least for the near future, humans are
2453840	2462480	going to be generally allergic to speaking with your AI avatar instead of you. It's disrespectful.
2462480	2468880	It's like speaking to a, to an answering machine. And that doesn't feel right. But
2469680	2475200	since we can make our calls much shorter, we can be much more efficient is what we were just talking
2475200	2481200	about is we can skip all the fluff and instantly understand one another and have a short call
2481200	2486800	and build rapport and get questions answered. And I know that you human answered me rather than
2486800	2492240	like your, your avatar. The same thing with like all of these like writing things that will reply
2492240	2496880	to emails for you and all of that. As soon as that becomes mainstream, I think that's just going
2496880	2502720	to generally kill email. Because like, what am I talking? Who am I talking to? Not talking to a
2502720	2508160	human. Can I take that to the bank? Oh no, my AI was hallucinating. I didn't mean that. I didn't
2508160	2513040	say that AI said it. So anyway, I'm not bullish on those things. I think they're novelties.
2513920	2520400	Now they're amazing novelties, you know, and we've got things that can generate content like you.
2520400	2524880	So you can answer emails and do all that. That's great and sound like you. But is that good? I'm
2524880	2528720	not sure. I don't think so. That's a good point. I think the respect part is key. Like you touched
2528720	2533120	on that just that one word represents it's like, I think once you do the matching, then the human
2533520	2537760	interaction, you can't at least like based on what we're talking about, you can't scale that
2538320	2542240	without the human elements always going to be important at the very bottom to build those
2542240	2548880	relationships. Yeah, we can use AI as we were just talking to make us radically more efficient at
2548880	2556480	communicating with one another. And therefore we could interact with more humans. Or we could
2556800	2563760	or we can get much deeper with one human using our time. Because communication can be
2564720	2569760	radically better. And alignment can be radically better. And disambiguation can be radically
2569760	2576400	better. And all of that human communication is looking at it from this lens is extraordinarily
2576400	2582000	draconian. We're in the dark ages of human communication. By the way, this is why we have
2582000	2588400	the battles we have in culture wars and all of this other stuff that we see sort of all around
2588400	2593760	this right now. All of this outrage. It's a communication problem. People say words, other
2593760	2598160	people hear something else, or they project something else onto something needs to help us
2598160	2604800	communicate with one another. And AI is going to do that mind indexing plus AI does just that.
2604800	2608160	Okay, that's a quote right there. We're going to quote that part that you just went through. That's
2608160	2614560	exactly it. So next thing I would say would be, you know, some interesting questions I had was
2614560	2619280	like, you know, as a, what are your thoughts actually now that we're talking about it, like
2619280	2623680	what are your thoughts on the GPT wrapper stuff where like, you know, people are just basically
2623680	2628480	using the open AI stuff and then just building like, one single feature thing. And then they're
2628480	2636400	making like, I don't know, 2550k 100k off it versus building a long term sustainable AI business
2636400	2640240	like you AI and then actually like literally thinking about the product, building a team,
2640880	2644480	you know, the two, like what do you what do you thoughts on those like, is it you think it's like
2644480	2648400	either or like pros and cons, obviously, but like, what do you think is like,
2649520	2652800	just general thoughts around it, the people that are doing either or.
2653520	2660080	Yeah. So both of those work and both of those are needed. I like to build platforms. I like to
2660080	2664880	build things that other people use to build things. Yeah. I don't like to build products,
2664960	2669280	actually. Like if you said to me, build an e-commerce store and go run it to me, that's
2669840	2674000	very uninteresting. I'm not knocking at some people. It's extraordinarily interesting.
2674000	2679520	But to me, it's not, but build a platform that allows people to build many e-commerce stores.
2679520	2685120	That's interesting. And so that's, so my advice to entrepreneurs is work on things that interest
2685120	2689200	you. That's the most important parts. If you're interested at the layer of platform,
2689200	2694720	go build a platform company. If you're interested in AI as a solution for some kind of a
2694720	2700560	problem and you want to build something that wraps that leverages chat, GPT or Claude or whatever,
2700560	2706160	and then provides a real service to consumers, you should do that. I would say go do it on
2706160	2710400	on mine studio because that's the fastest, easiest way to do it. I don't know if faster
2710400	2714080	way to do it. You don't need to launch a, you don't need to go raise venture capital. That's
2714080	2719360	right. Bootstrap, build it and then like ship it because that speed at time is like of the essence.
2719360	2723360	Yeah. And again, I'm not kidding. You can do it this afternoon. Whenever you hear this,
2723360	2729040	you can do it that same day and launch it and promote it and start to make money that same day.
2729040	2732880	And then the next day build another one because again, there's countless use cases that need to
2732880	2737120	be enumerated and built out. So I think both of those approaches work just depends on what you're,
2737680	2742160	what you like doing. It's going to be interesting on these about the second order effects of you
2742160	2746320	creating the platform and then people going on and literally building agencies. I'm excited to see
2746320	2750800	that of like, Hey, we're going to build on you AI for the small businesses that don't know anything
2750800	2755120	about AI. And then they just like build it for them or even just any business. And then they'll
2755120	2759600	be charging like thousands of dollars. I'm sure it's going to happen. Someone's going to do it.
2759600	2763040	And it's going to be really good. I know who's going to do it first because we're about, they
2763040	2769120	reached out to us and there we go with them. So what you described is literally about to happen
2769120	2774400	where I can't give it away. Unfortunately here, but, but you'll see it and there'll be a
2775040	2782080	first of many I'm sure partnerships of other companies, big companies. This one's over 20 years
2782080	2788400	old has got over 2000 employees that are showing up and saying, Hey, we can leverage all of this
2788400	2793200	power we have with our customer base. And we just want to be able to very quickly,
2794640	2801120	you know, create a bunch of AI services that we can then sell to our existing clients
2801760	2806000	and new clients. And these are in businesses. So this is not a consumer thing. It's a
2806800	2810800	SMB primarily thing. And the platform just gets better and better. So it makes sense.
2810800	2815440	It's like a long-term partnership. Interesting. What do you think would be the, you know,
2815440	2819760	aside from you AI, what do you think could be the next let's quote unquote say like most impactful
2820560	2824800	AI business that no one is building because you've seen a lot. So what would you say would be
2824800	2832400	something that you're like, Oh, okay. I think the businesses is a big sort of question mark word
2832400	2836640	there. If we can take that out and forget the business part of it, because there's a bunch of
2836640	2843680	business dynamics that might prevent extraordinarily powerful things, transformative things to occur
2844480	2848240	and that could radically change the world. And by the way, then change how you would even build
2848240	2853280	businesses. Like what does it mean to build a business? If we were talking early in the podcast,
2853280	2857440	right? I said that venture capitalists are struggling with sort of the pace of disruption.
2858240	2862000	And I think that's only going to accelerate. And so how do you build a business? What is a
2862000	2866800	business? You certainly don't write a business plan. Do you have time to incorporate? No,
2866800	2871520	you don't. I mean, you should, but you do that later. The first thing you do is you throw a lot
2871520	2875040	of stuff at the wall and see what sticks. And once it sticks, that's when you build a business
2875040	2880880	around. And so like finding product market fit becomes something you do multiple times a day on
2880880	2884480	different things until you find it. And then you very quickly go do it. And by the way,
2884480	2889440	you'll probably get disrupted shortly thereafter, because other people can do that too.
2889440	2894240	Once they have the idea, they'll do that too. And that's going to be really hard to build
2894240	2899760	businesses in general, not kind of an environment. Yeah. So well, if we take that off the table,
2900560	2905280	then it becomes arguably even a more difficult question, because everywhere you look,
2906240	2913200	their AI is going to create transformative, like massively transformative change. Look at medicine,
2913760	2921760	will radically transform medicine, access to diagnosis, ability for personalized treatment
2921760	2931040	plans, discovery, research, one of the reasons that we got these mRNA vaccines so quickly
2931040	2934800	is because of our current computing capabilities to be able to run all these things, right? And we
2935360	2942240	do things proactively. So you're doing research while we sleep at wire speed, right? And that's,
2942240	2947280	by the way, only accelerating. And so whatever, that's medicine, you can pick anything else.
2947280	2954240	But I'll point you to one that we talked about earlier, which is the creator economy is about
2954240	2960800	to be destroyed, I believe, as an economy. Now this is going to be provocative. And because I
2960800	2964720	built a company in the creator economy space, it becomes even more provocative. And I'm not
2964800	2970720	trying to be provocative. I just want to point to something that we think is obvious, which is
2970720	2976400	humans are obviously creative beings. And so we will never stop creating for the sake of creating
2976400	2982640	and using our creations as a means of communicating with one another, self expression, etc. Check.
2982640	2986800	But making that into a business and monetizing it, when you make something into a business,
2987440	2993440	you start to deal with the cost of goods. How much time does it take me to produce a piece of
2993440	2998880	content versus how much money can I get from producing that content? As soon as you look at
2998880	3006080	that equation, it becomes very clear that there's no need, no possibility for humans to compete with
3006080	3013280	automated content creation. Personalized automated content creation. So we already see
3013280	3018560	automated YouTube channels, mostly the stuff that producing is kind of junk. Soon it won't be junk.
3018720	3024080	It'll be as compelling as anything produced by a human. But it'll be produced on demand for each of
3024080	3029280	us individually. And that's obviously going to be radically more compelling than anything else.
3029280	3034240	And so I think the only YouTubers in the sense that might get a pass for a little while are the
3034240	3040000	YouTubers where the content is about them, the human, not about anything else. Because that goes
3040000	3044000	back to that thing we were just talking about where I don't want to talk to your AI. I want to
3044000	3049520	talk to your AI. I want to talk to you. I don't want to see your AI generated, you know, vlog
3049520	3055840	videos. I want to see you. Okay, great. Then you're safe. But for everything else, I don't care if
3055840	3062800	it's you who created it or not. I care about the topic. And there that topic is going to be, again,
3062800	3066800	because it's personalized, it's going to be so much better than anything you could possibly
3066800	3072320	afford to produce. And that's going to be very, very disruptive. That's true. Because then it's
3073200	3077280	self-explanatory, like it's just personalized to me. I don't need to search for anything.
3077840	3081520	And that's the ultimate, yeah, personalization AI. Interesting. Okay.
3082560	3090000	Proactive AI. AI, we shouldn't be asking AI what to do generally. Again, this is the Dark Ages.
3090000	3094640	Another way of looking at it is try to explain some people like, if you met a genie, and the genie
3094640	3100800	said, I can, I'll answer any of your questions. What do you want to know? And some people say,
3100800	3105200	what's the meaning of life and all that? That's great. But I say that my question would be,
3106160	3112160	what question should I ask? What should I know that I don't know? What's the most important thing
3112160	3118560	to know? I don't know. So how can I ask the question? Only thing I can do is say, I trust that you
3119360	3126240	may know what I should be asking you, because you know the world. And I'm just little on me.
3126240	3131520	And I'm willing to tell you about myself. That's the mind digitization. I'll tell you what I know
3131520	3136960	and I don't know how I see the world. And you tell me what I should know to make my life better
3138080	3142880	and to make my children's lives better. That's the ultimate thing. And I think that reversal
3143600	3149040	of roles where the AI can take the lead is the big transformative thing. That's what takes us
3149040	3156000	again to wire speed. And those are those quantum leaps and capabilities, not our ability to type
3156080	3164080	faster. That's true. Yeah. And also like that AI can coach us can be like the life guide as well
3164080	3170160	once they learn everything about us, not just for the relationship aspect. Wow. Okay. I won't be
3170160	3174080	respectful of your time. So I know we've got a few minutes left. I'm just gonna rapid fire these
3174080	3178400	three because I think they'll be really interesting. Like if you were to lose everything tomorrow,
3178400	3183680	like what would you what would you rebuild aside from aside from UAI? You mean in business?
3184080	3189440	Could be business or could be everything where you're like, oh, sorry, for business. Let's say
3189440	3193440	for business. That's right. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, not not. Yeah, just business. Yeah,
3193440	3198080	let's get in business. Yeah. If I was to lose everything in business, what would I build?
3200400	3204720	Again, if I maintain sort of the same state of mind that I have now, and I looked at opportunities
3204720	3212320	where would opportunity be, I would instantly start launching AIs. Now again, some people would
3212400	3215840	look at this and say, okay, well, he's building a damn platform. He's just promoting it. He's
3215840	3219760	biased. And I respect that. But I'm telling you, like as much as I can strip that away,
3220400	3226560	that's what I would do because this is obviously the growth area. This is obviously green field.
3226560	3232560	I wouldn't go and build like mobile apps, almost 3 million in each app store, that thing is saturated.
3232560	3238320	I wouldn't go and try to do like drop shipping and affiliate programs and any of that stuff.
3238320	3243520	That doesn't make sense. If I wanted to build a business, I would go and leverage all of the
3243520	3250720	power of AI and I would build things for the world that the world needed. And then depends on
3251920	3259280	what I address, consumery things or SMB things or enterprise things or medical or whatever,
3260160	3266560	depends. I tend to like consumery things rather than, I mean, I built an enterprise
3266560	3270800	software company, Aconics, the cybersecurity company, raised 34 million for it, spent five
3270800	3276400	years of fidget. So I know enterprise. I don't much enjoy building enterprise products. So I
3276400	3281040	probably do consumery things. Very cool. And then what's the single, what would you say
3281040	3284560	with the single greatest lesson you've learned so far in life, if you were to pick one?
3284560	3298080	That I, like you, am an instance of the universe and that we are as connected to one another as
3298080	3304240	my fingers are connected on my hand, that this is not a finger that's different from this finger
3304240	3310960	and in competition with one another, struggling to get all the resources. So this finger has fewer
3310960	3317840	resources. If you do that, your hand dies and that we, all of us, including the animals and the
3317840	3323040	plants and all of us are instances of one thing you can call it God, you can call it nature,
3323040	3329040	you can call it universe. You don't have to call it anything, but that, that, by the way, that I
3329040	3336400	discovered in my first Burning Man in 2009. And I'm about to go to my 12th Burning Man. Oh, wow.
3337280	3340640	So I'm leaving tomorrow for my 12th Burning Man with all of my kids
3341360	3348640	and my family and my parents in law who now this is their seventh year at Burning Man. And so all
3348640	3353520	of that came from that. So I think that would, that's the most profound thing that I learned when
3353520	3358560	I was 40. And that changed my life. That also is the thing that made me want to have children,
3359360	3364560	you know, until my 40s. I didn't think I wanted children. I shouldn't populate the world and
3364560	3371760	any of that. But now I realize that it's a, the world is a wonderful place, not a place,
3373360	3379280	thing that keeps happening. And I'm part of it. And my job is to participate.
3380160	3384720	I love that. I love that. That could have been, could have been well put. And then obviously,
3384720	3388880	big lesson to go to Burning Man, especially if you've done it 17 times is it?
3389840	3394640	Sorry, 12. Oh, 12. Wow. Okay. So that's, okay. So I'm going to sign my own
3394640	3399440	register for it in the next one. I don't think I can go for tomorrow, but yeah, that's, that's
3399440	3405280	amazing. Well, okay, Demetri, this is honestly, it was more than I expected in terms of like mind
3405280	3410960	blowing, like insights and stuff. I learned a lot, really appreciate you. I think that like,
3410960	3415760	in the middle part where you talked about like the YouTube and then they released like the thing,
3415760	3420080	and then there was the deeper, profound lessons. So I'm definitely going to re-listen to this myself,
3420080	3424000	because I think that we covered a lot of things and we went like deeper. And I love that you've got
3424000	3430000	the personal like philosophical and like deeper level thinking. And I'm sure that's like, that's
3430000	3434640	how you always operate. But it's just like, it's just great to hear that. And then not just talk
3434640	3441120	about like the, the technical aspect, but getting more grounded as well. It's basically, I think,
3441120	3446000	I was thinking about the title of this episode, speaking to a brilliant mind. Like that's what
3446000	3449680	came to my mind. So something like that, speaking to a brilliant mind, but then going into more
3449680	3453920	deep depth of like UAI. And it obviously like will come with something interesting for the titles
3453920	3458960	and stuff. And there was a lot of great clips and content there for sure. Appreciate it. It was a
3458960	3464160	lot of fun. Yeah, I had a great time chatting. Thanks for wanting me to, to spend time with you.
3464160	3470080	It was a pleasure. Yeah, likewise. Any questions, thoughts or anything before we wrap up?
3470080	3477680	Yeah, excited to that we're connected. I'm excited that I you clearly understood what I said,
3477680	3483600	that's awesome. And now that you've understood it, I think what I've done is I've planted that
3483600	3489760	seed in your mind that you can now help me spread the word. Yes, this is what people should be doing.
3489760	3496240	Like this is the new I'm certain this is the you want to side hustle, this is the new side hustle,
3496240	3500800	you want to build a business. This is the place to build a business. There's no point trying to go
3500800	3504560	and raise venture capital and build this big company to build a business that doesn't make
3504560	3509120	any sense in this environment. We had to build a business to solve a problem, leverage the power
3509120	3514320	of AI to solve a problem and put a price on it. And then solve another problem tomorrow and another
3514320	3520000	problem the next day. When you solve a whole collection of problems, you get massively rich.
3520000	3526160	You've done great work to help the world be better. You've leveraged all the power of AI is those AI
3526720	3532880	get better, your AI gets better. Because behind the scenes, it's always using all of those models.
3533680	3539120	Yeah, you're never stagnant. You're never, you're never stuck. You don't have to upgrade anything.
3540560	3544800	Open the eyes can upgrade things. Anthropics can upgrade things. You know, Facebook's gonna
3544800	3550480	upgrade things. And as those things get upgraded, your AI continues to get better. I don't know of a
3550480	3560960	more clear entrepreneurial path. Exclamation point. There we go. Awesome. Thanks again, Dimitri.
3560960	3568640	Have a safe flight and enjoy the 12th Burning Man. Thanks. Yeah, so 16 hour drive. No flights.
3568640	3573760	Yeah, 16 hour drive and then another probably eight hours sitting at the gate to get in and then
3573760	3580400	you got to set everything up. It's not a vacation of any sorts. It's a it's a bit of a sort of going
3580400	3587760	to the moon and doing it. But I love it. I find it I find it powerful. Yeah. Amazing. Well,
