00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Professor Luciano Floridi is the Oxford Internet Institute's Professor of Philosophy

00:05.680 --> 00:11.440
and Ethics of Information at the University of Oxford, where he's also the Director of the

00:11.440 --> 00:17.280
Digital Ethics Lab of the Oxford Internet Institute. Still in Oxford, he's a distinguished

00:17.280 --> 00:22.400
research fellow of the Yuhiro Centre for Practical Ethics of the Faculty of Philosophy

00:22.400 --> 00:27.680
and Research Associate and Fellow in Information Policy in the Department of Computer Science.

00:28.480 --> 00:34.160
Outside Oxford, he's the Faculty Fellow of the Alan Turing Institute and Chair of its Data Ethics

00:34.160 --> 00:39.760
Group and the Distinguished Scholar in Residence of the Department of Economics at the American

00:39.760 --> 00:46.800
University in Washington DC. His research concerns primarily digital ethics, the philosophy of

00:46.800 --> 00:53.200
information, which is a discipline he founded, and the philosophy of technology itself.

00:53.200 --> 01:01.120
I will introduce AI as a divorce between the ability to perform a task successfully

01:01.120 --> 01:08.560
in view of a goal, shall we say, play chess just to be trivial, and any need to be intelligent

01:08.560 --> 01:17.200
in doing so. Replace that with parking a car, landing an aircraft, delivering something to your house.

01:17.920 --> 01:23.600
You don't have to be intelligent to do that if you are a piece of AI. That's why it works.

01:24.560 --> 01:31.920
If you had to wait to be intelligent, it would. My iPhone there, turn off properly, would not play

01:31.920 --> 01:37.840
better chess than anyone else in this room if we had to wait for their iPhone to be as intelligent

01:37.840 --> 01:44.160
as a rat. It is because it isn't, and we gave up on trying to make it intelligent as a rat.

01:45.040 --> 01:49.840
We're in the midst of an information revolution, as well as a computing revolution.

01:50.400 --> 01:56.560
Floridi said in his introductory book that all members of the G7 qualify as information

01:56.560 --> 02:03.840
societies, because in each country, at least 70% of their GDP depends on intangible goods,

02:03.840 --> 02:10.320
which are information related, not on material goods. Their functioning and growth requires

02:10.320 --> 02:18.800
and generates immense amounts of data, more data than humanity has ever seen in its entire history.

02:18.800 --> 02:26.880
It was estimated in 2003 that humanity had accumulated approximately 12 exabytes of data,

02:26.880 --> 02:32.480
and we're fast approaching the age of the zettabyte, which is 1000 exabytes.

02:33.280 --> 02:38.400
Sometimes people think in terms of, oh, can we regulate AI, which is a bit like, can we regulate

02:38.400 --> 02:44.880
electricity? Well, it's a bit vague. What do you mean? It's not true, false, correct, incorrect.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.840
It just doesn't yet make any friction with the real world.

02:49.360 --> 02:56.000
Floridi thinks that the material world is becoming redundant. Our agency as humans is being

02:56.000 --> 03:01.680
perniciously eroded, and that the increasing dominance of the information landscape, or the

03:02.240 --> 03:08.000
infosphere as Floridi calls it, is becoming the primary basis for our reality.

03:09.040 --> 03:15.840
Now about 95% of all of the data that we have today has been created by the current generation.

03:15.840 --> 03:22.240
We're not talking about Shakespeare or Dante. We're talking about lots and lots of dogs and

03:22.240 --> 03:29.200
cats. Floridi thinks that the infosphere is becoming so polluted with every passing day

03:29.200 --> 03:34.320
that the manifold of the infosphere is increasingly determined by technology

03:34.320 --> 03:40.000
and artificial intelligence. People are consumers. Consumers become followers.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.120
Followers become barcodes. Increasingly, the data is stored in a representation,

03:45.120 --> 03:51.200
which is primarily machine-readable, designed for consumption by other machines. Our very

03:51.200 --> 03:57.200
existence is being squeezed as a result. It wouldn't be great to have something instead

03:57.200 --> 04:04.400
of us doing it for us, better than us. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, if you read the description

04:04.400 --> 04:12.080
of that something that does it instead of us, better than us, in Aristotle, it's a slave.

04:13.360 --> 04:20.240
That's what we could do in the past. It was horrible. Luckily, it's not happening around us.

04:21.200 --> 04:26.480
But we were using humans as means to an end. Now we can use technology.

04:27.600 --> 04:33.200
Why this divorce? Why sort of pulling apart and saying, look, I want to develop something that

04:33.200 --> 04:38.400
is successful. I don't care whether it does it in the same way as I do it. As long as it's successful,

04:38.400 --> 04:43.520
that's fine. As opposed to, no, no, I want to implement human cognition. And if it's not human

04:43.520 --> 04:48.160
cognition, I don't care whether it's successful or not, but it has to have a little spark. Now,

04:48.160 --> 04:53.280
remember, AI, is it an engineering branch? Or is it a branch of colony science? Well,

04:53.280 --> 05:01.200
as a branch of colony science, we are at year zero. No step forward. We do not have the intelligence,

05:01.200 --> 05:08.960
as I said, of a rat. When it comes to engineering, that looks like magic. That looks like what has

05:08.960 --> 05:16.240
happened to humanity. Who has given us so much brain to do what we're doing today? And the old

05:16.240 --> 05:23.360
phrase like, is it worth asking whether a submarine can swim? Really? Can a computer think,

05:23.360 --> 05:28.240
ah, that's the wrong question. That's not the framework within which we should understand

05:28.240 --> 05:32.240
what a computer does. A submarine does what it does. An airplane does what it does. And it

05:32.240 --> 05:36.800
doesn't do it like a bird, doesn't do it like a fish. But it does it successfully. And that's

05:36.800 --> 05:42.880
the whole engineering point here. Success in delivering the output, given that particular input.

05:42.880 --> 05:46.960
But how do you know it's not the same process? Well, imagine you have two, two,

05:46.960 --> 05:53.040
four, and I tell you one is plus, the other one is multiplication. Which one did I use to get four

05:53.040 --> 05:58.480
from two and two? I don't know. Two plus two is equal to four. Two by two is four. You see, you

05:58.480 --> 06:05.200
can't say. So it's the same thing. No, it isn't. The way I do the dishes, the way my dishwasher

06:05.200 --> 06:11.600
does the dishes, two different things. Florides said something very significant and profound

06:11.600 --> 06:17.520
has recently happened to human self understanding. He said that in many respects,

06:17.520 --> 06:24.000
we're not standalone entities, but rather interconnected informational organisms or

06:24.000 --> 06:31.040
info orgs, sharing with biological agents and engineered artifacts, a global environment

06:31.040 --> 06:38.080
ultimately made of information, what Florides calls the info sphere. This is the informational

06:38.080 --> 06:44.880
environment constituted by all the informational processes, services and entities, thus,

06:44.880 --> 06:50.640
including the informational agents, as well as their properties and interactions and mutual

06:50.640 --> 06:56.480
relations. Now, if there was a representative scientist for the fourth revolution, this would

06:56.480 --> 07:03.040
definitely be allenturing. It's now critical that we equip ourselves with a viable philosophy of

07:03.040 --> 07:03.760
information.

07:07.680 --> 07:11.920
Gazillions of data, yeah, of any kind, of any sort, and they're all digital, readable, machine

07:11.920 --> 07:16.560
readable. When I mean machine readable, they're barcodes, not meant for our eyes, they're meant

07:16.560 --> 07:21.440
for the machines. If you hear anything about the natives, the natives in this space are the robots,

07:21.440 --> 07:29.200
not us. We scuba dive. But these machines, they are digital elements in the digital environment,

07:29.200 --> 07:35.680
reading digital stuff and digital processing, etc. And of course, I show you better machine

07:35.680 --> 07:41.040
learning, better algorithms, but also more and more internal things, things connected to other

07:41.040 --> 07:47.280
things. And when you go home and you see all those green and blue lights, they're not for us,

07:47.280 --> 07:51.840
they're talking to each other. And a lot of the data we have are generated by those machines.

07:52.000 --> 08:02.160
Information and communication technologies have been changing the world profoundly and irreversibly

08:02.160 --> 08:09.280
for more than half a century now, with breathtaking scope and at neck breaking pace. On the one hand,

08:09.280 --> 08:14.960
they've brought concrete and imminent opportunities of enormous benefit to people's education,

08:14.960 --> 08:20.240
welfare and prosperity, as well as great economic and scientific advantages.

08:22.720 --> 08:29.440
This merging of our existence, both analog and digital, both online and offline,

08:30.480 --> 08:37.120
we really ever offline? Of course not. So I'm reminded normally that if you have ever heard

08:37.120 --> 08:41.440
the whale singing, if you don't even know what I'm talking about, then you're very, very young.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.680
But if you know what I'm talking about, then you have used something called a modem.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.760
That is called whale singing. And if you have heard the whale singing,

08:52.320 --> 08:57.360
well, you're more like on my side of the divide. So we don't hear the whale singing anymore.

09:00.320 --> 09:06.480
Floridi thinks that the risks are the nature of reality and our knowledge of it. The organization

09:06.480 --> 09:13.040
of a fair society, considering the digital divide, our responsibilities and obligations to present

09:13.040 --> 09:19.280
and future generations, our understanding of a global world, and the scope of our potential

09:19.280 --> 09:25.760
interactions with the environment. And finally, conceptual implications and complexity of an

09:25.760 --> 09:31.840
information and communication technology landscape. So we don't hear the whale singing anymore. There

09:31.840 --> 09:40.640
is no terminator coming. There is no gods in the sky deciding for us. There's nobody but humanity

09:40.640 --> 09:45.040
responsibility for what we're going to do with this technology. And anyone disagrees,

09:45.840 --> 09:49.040
I hope is just naive and doesn't have an agenda.

09:53.760 --> 09:58.240
Floridi said that the information society has grown quickly and chaotically,

09:58.240 --> 10:03.040
leading to a lack of balance between technological growth and a lack of understanding

10:03.040 --> 10:08.240
of the implications of this growth. It also highlights the need to dig deeper into the

10:08.240 --> 10:14.480
nature and implications of the information age in order to better anticipate and identify

10:14.480 --> 10:23.760
and resolve problems. We started understanding ourselves in roughly in two ways, who I am

10:24.320 --> 10:32.800
and what I can do. I am, no humanity speaking, different, exceptional, special because of my

10:32.800 --> 10:41.840
nature and because and or what I can do compared to anything else. So one is called personal identity.

10:42.400 --> 10:49.680
It's going to come close to privacy and the gazillions of data out there are eroding or

10:50.240 --> 10:57.680
transforming, exercising pressure on that particular who I am, my nature, my data subject,

10:57.680 --> 11:03.440
as we are defined by the European legislation, we all data subjects here. GDPR, General Data Protection

11:03.440 --> 11:08.640
Regulation says so. So if you have data subject and there's a gazillion of data about you

11:08.640 --> 11:14.000
somewhere being manipulated, well certainly your identity is not sure we say in question.

11:14.800 --> 11:20.240
The other half is remember not who I am but what I can do, as opposed to anyone else,

11:20.240 --> 11:25.680
what I say I, and we define ourselves at least since Kant onwards in manner of the German

11:25.680 --> 11:32.720
philosophy in terms of autonomy. We are special because we are in control of our actions, we

11:32.720 --> 11:39.120
can decide, we can plan, we can choose. Well now we have autonomous agents out there and if you

11:39.120 --> 11:45.600
are trying to identify yourself as we can only be not the ones who play chess, well then we are

11:45.600 --> 11:50.800
really in trouble. You can devalue human skills, you can remove human responsibility, you can reduce

11:50.800 --> 11:56.640
human control. Erode human self-determination is the other side of the coin. It's not super dangerous

11:57.520 --> 12:07.120
but the rock who thought that their little drop of water was nothing, 18 years later has a big hole

12:07.120 --> 12:12.880
in it because drop after drop after drop, the drop will shape the stone will shape the rock.

12:19.840 --> 12:26.080
Surely we want to have a technology that makes us more capable of deciding what we want

12:27.120 --> 12:35.520
or prefer what we really have in front of us and I'm a bit worried that here human nature,

12:35.520 --> 12:40.960
no we philosophers we know something about human nature, we'll kick in, we're lazy,

12:42.800 --> 12:50.720
we're also very malleable and we are easily convinced to do this or that so we need to be a

12:50.720 --> 12:57.600
little bit more careful exposing this very fragile malleable entity to a very robust,

12:58.400 --> 13:07.360
quite silly, very efficient, very successful technology that will probably tend to inadvertently

13:08.080 --> 13:13.360
change the nature of that fragile entity. This is something that I would like to be a little

13:13.360 --> 13:20.880
bit more concerned about, not terminator. So until recently you would go to know this wonderful techie

13:20.960 --> 13:29.520
conferences and it was all about technology innovation. The average politician salivates

13:29.520 --> 13:34.320
immediately as soon as you talk about innovation because innovation is growth, growth is money,

13:34.320 --> 13:39.600
money is jobs and people happy. So innovation, innovation, yeah, absolutely and it's crucial

13:39.600 --> 13:43.840
but it's not real challenge. I don't think that that's the most difficult challenge we are facing

13:43.840 --> 13:49.200
now, not because it's easy but because something more difficult to do behind innovation. The challenge

13:49.200 --> 13:56.160
therefore is how you govern all this but governance is a matter of design, designing the right policies

13:56.160 --> 14:01.520
so that incentives and disincentives are in the right place, there are no loopholes, people tend

14:01.520 --> 14:06.720
to do more the right thing than the bad thing. So all of a sudden we are shifting all this into

14:06.720 --> 14:11.920
socio-political issues. It's a matter of design, design the kind of society we want, remember

14:11.920 --> 14:18.720
what's the human project here that we want to implement. So anyway, I had a very fun trip up

14:18.720 --> 14:24.960
to Oxford the other day and had a chat with Luciano himself. I hope you find this episode

14:24.960 --> 14:32.160
valuable. Remember to subscribe and if you're listening give us a rating on Apple podcasts

14:32.160 --> 14:43.120
or whatever you listen to the podcast on. Enjoy. So to start proceedings off with misinformation,

14:43.760 --> 14:50.160
the internet has put the world in our pocket, knowledge at our fingertips but the business

14:50.160 --> 14:56.320
of the internet is about ads and exploitation, debasement and derangement of human attention

14:56.320 --> 15:00.880
and some have argued that social media is a bit like the climate change of our society.

15:01.520 --> 15:05.600
Are you concerned that the current state of internet economics will create

15:05.600 --> 15:10.400
a layer of plausible yet false abstraction between us and reality?

15:10.480 --> 15:19.840
There is a risk of more and more content being worthless, unreliable, false, misleading,

15:20.640 --> 15:28.560
fake news, propaganda. It is not a new problem but the size, the immensity, the impact is new.

15:29.360 --> 15:34.880
It's one thing if you publish a few pamphlets with several lies and another thing if you have

15:35.760 --> 15:42.240
hundreds or millions of followers believing at once that something was not the case and

15:42.240 --> 15:48.160
something that was the case wasn't. And I'm talking about elections and very public figures.

15:50.160 --> 15:57.760
I wouldn't however put the whole emphasis on the negative side. The social media are also,

15:57.760 --> 16:03.120
if we want, the solution to the problem. Today are part of the problem, I agree,

16:03.200 --> 16:08.080
but they could easily become part of the solution. Precisely because then if you remember,

16:08.080 --> 16:16.160
and I close here, good old days when we were online and there was no web, only the internet,

16:17.520 --> 16:21.760
we thought that we were going to create a more informed, more civilized, more reasonable

16:23.120 --> 16:30.800
environment. We can still do that. It's the kind of business models and lack of political, legal

16:31.760 --> 16:39.840
framework that has generated this tsunami of, shall we say, rubbish, which is polluting our

16:39.840 --> 16:47.120
infosphere, the space of our information. So, yes, it is a problem, no, it doesn't have to be a

16:47.120 --> 16:52.640
problem. It could be easily a big solution. One suggestion for all and as close here, imagine

16:52.640 --> 16:59.600
if we were to ban, and it's a bit of a joke, advertisement online. We'd have to pay, we would

16:59.600 --> 17:05.040
pay for the product. That means that there will be competition for quality. We'll be probably in

17:05.040 --> 17:11.040
a different kind of game. Interesting. And we'll get into a minute, we'll get into the subject of how

17:11.920 --> 17:20.880
the structures of, let's say, markets and economic models affect us as human beings and as a society,

17:20.880 --> 17:29.040
but also affects our perception of reality, essentially. But before we get there, you wrote

17:29.200 --> 17:36.480
a paper called GPT-3, It's Nature, Scopes, Limits and Consequences. And you said that

17:37.200 --> 17:40.640
reversible and irreversible questions are based on mathematical logic,

17:41.760 --> 17:47.120
libanate law and other fields such as computing and physics. Can you explain what you meant by that?

17:48.960 --> 17:52.560
It's a simple idea. So, if I fail, it's my fault.

17:53.440 --> 18:03.120
A question that I define there as reversible means that from the answer, you can reverse to

18:03.840 --> 18:11.520
the actual identity of the source of the answer. An irreversible one is one that doesn't allow

18:11.520 --> 18:18.480
you to do that. Let me give you an irreversible answer today. Come to my house, you find clean

18:18.480 --> 18:24.800
dishes on the table. Who has cleaned the dishes? It's irreversible. You can't tell. It could be me

18:24.800 --> 18:29.440
or it could be the dishwasher. So, you cannot tell, by looking at the dishes, the output,

18:30.000 --> 18:33.840
whether those dishes have gone through a process of hand washing or machine washing,

18:33.840 --> 18:39.680
and whether the source is one or the other. A reversible one would be the sort of question

18:40.160 --> 18:49.760
today, and I'm talking today. We can ask to chat GPT. Use anything like Mary's mother has

18:49.760 --> 18:56.640
three children, tell me the name of one of them, and GPT says, I don't know. It does, I have no

18:56.640 --> 19:04.640
enough information. It's Mary's mother, so surely. So, that becomes immediately reversible. You know

19:04.640 --> 19:13.680
exactly that the answer is coming from a computer, from a large language model, and not from a human

19:13.680 --> 19:20.800
being who gets that immediately. Imagine the other way around. You ask for a super complex

19:20.800 --> 19:26.640
calculation, and boom, you get the answer in a fraction of a second. The other one may come

19:26.640 --> 19:33.520
snake and maybe takes longer, so who was the other side? So, increasingly in the paper, I write that,

19:34.800 --> 19:39.280
and it was before chat GPT coming out, but it's obvious, and it's been, you know, our progress

19:39.280 --> 19:46.000
since then. Increasingly, the sort of output that we are dealing with will become irreversible. We

19:46.000 --> 19:51.440
will be unable to tell whether the source is, for example, a human being, a group of human being,

19:51.440 --> 19:59.600
a human being with a computer, or chat GPT, or whatever is going to come, GPT4, etc. Imagine

19:59.600 --> 20:06.640
GPT10, not many years from now. I think that it will be completely irreversible. It does not mean,

20:06.640 --> 20:12.000
however, let me close here, that I'm like the dishwasher. If you can't tell who did the dishes,

20:12.960 --> 20:17.200
what difference does it make? I've done them in one way, which is completely different.

20:17.920 --> 20:24.640
The machine does it in a sort of mechanical, etc. So, we should be clear about what we infer from

20:25.440 --> 20:31.200
the reversibility, any reversibility of the output, and that seems to me where a lot of confusion is

20:31.200 --> 20:38.080
generated. Interesting. So, there's the provenance of the information. So, where it originated from,

20:38.080 --> 20:43.040
we could go down the line of saying, because it is human aligned with this reinforcement

20:43.040 --> 20:47.120
learning for human feedback, it's remarkably human aligned, actually, much more than the original

20:47.120 --> 20:55.520
GPT3. Then, you spoke to this semantic divergence, and we can talk about the pragmatic divergence

20:55.520 --> 21:00.720
as well. Actually, that's getting into a little bit about what John Sow talked about,

21:00.720 --> 21:06.800
the difference between ontology and epistemology. Is that something that you're

21:06.800 --> 21:12.560
seriously concerned about? Could you expand on that? I am concerned about it. I'm one of the

21:12.560 --> 21:20.480
few people, or I hope many more than Sims, who agree with the Chinese room and the

21:20.480 --> 21:25.120
philosophy behind it. Of course, you can always, among philosophers, you can always argue for

21:25.120 --> 21:30.240
details and sophisticated counter-argument, etc. But the bottom line, I mean, John got it

21:30.240 --> 21:35.280
right a long time ago, we're dealing with syntactic engines. There is no understanding,

21:35.280 --> 21:40.720
there is no insight, there is no emotional involvement, etc. Anything that would go

21:40.720 --> 21:45.440
into qualifying, characterizing human intelligence, which is also a rather fuzzy

21:45.440 --> 21:51.600
concept, by the way. On that front, I think we're going to see more and more of successful machines

21:52.480 --> 21:58.160
of the kind that we were just discussing. You mentioned the source, because that is

21:58.160 --> 22:02.640
the real difference. Let me give you a small example.

22:03.360 --> 22:14.480
Suppose you take from the shelf an amazing novel, a novel that John won the Nobel, for example.

22:16.240 --> 22:21.680
I would be surprised if you were to confuse that for something that's been generated by GPTX.

22:23.360 --> 22:28.800
The other thing is not true. Suppose you take a normal text, like an encyclopedia entry,

22:28.800 --> 22:35.120
or a good summary of that novel. Would you be able to tell me whether is a human being or GPTX?

22:35.120 --> 22:41.120
You wouldn't. So there's also a symmetry between the sort of product that we get and the sort of

22:42.240 --> 22:48.560
inferences that we can run. Final point, you know, technique is not everything,

22:49.200 --> 22:58.000
and we always fall into the same trap. You see someone reproducing on the pavement in a street,

22:58.000 --> 23:02.960
the Sistine Chapel. It's amazing. I mean, I wish I could do that, but it's not Michelangelo.

23:02.960 --> 23:09.200
Why? Well, because there is a different history, a different intention, there's a different aesthetics.

23:09.760 --> 23:17.280
So the mere ability of reproducing or doing like fails to get the semantic capital behind all that,

23:17.280 --> 23:23.120
the intention, the interpretation, the historical context, the continuity, the why did it happen

23:23.120 --> 23:30.960
and did not happen something else. All that is the richness of our understanding and semantics.

23:30.960 --> 23:37.440
We lose that if we think that all the difference that there is between Michelangelo and the artist

23:37.440 --> 23:42.160
in the street is just technique. It's not the case, and we should not be confused on that.

23:43.280 --> 23:48.560
I completely agree with you that there is a rich semantic context which is embedded,

23:49.200 --> 23:56.800
and this is something I'm conflicted on. So I agree with Soil in the sense that he said

23:56.800 --> 24:02.560
there was this rich and nagle actually, this impenetrable realm of the subject of experience,

24:02.560 --> 24:07.680
and that informs the meaning. You know, there's an ontological difference in understanding,

24:07.680 --> 24:13.920
which is what Soil said. But what's been so remarkable with chat GPT is it does seem to

24:14.880 --> 24:22.400
confer some semantic sort of inference, if you like. And I think the reason for that is

24:22.400 --> 24:31.760
going back to Pierce's triad, the symbolic version, the semantic content is embedded in

24:31.760 --> 24:38.400
our language. And that's why GPT3, even though it's mimicry, it often appears to, I mean,

24:38.480 --> 24:43.040
for example, it knows what the concept of Christmas is. So now it's becoming

24:44.080 --> 24:48.400
such a close reflection of us, it's becoming more difficult to distinguish.

24:50.160 --> 24:56.240
And at some point it would be impossible, if not already. But we should be careful not to confuse

24:56.240 --> 25:03.280
this with what you mentioned before, the intentionality, the realm of meaning, of existential

25:04.240 --> 25:12.160
experience of all this. Christmas is something that reverberates and provides meaning, for example,

25:12.160 --> 25:17.680
in each of us for a reason that is utterly cultural. It would have meant nothing to play

25:18.720 --> 25:23.280
obviously for historical reasons and so on. Let me give you an example. This would be like

25:23.280 --> 25:28.880
saying that when you cut the tree and you find the rings of the tree telling the age of the tree,

25:28.880 --> 25:36.240
the tree somehow told us its age. Well, it takes a little bit of imagination.

25:36.240 --> 25:42.160
No, it did not. And yet the symbolic, the representational, it is true that the tree has

25:42.720 --> 25:48.400
provided that information to begin with. But it's also because we can interpret that way. So

25:49.440 --> 25:54.480
I would like to see more work done on the hermeneutical side of all this, so that we get

25:54.720 --> 26:03.920
it clear on what we are consuming. Content, which is sometimes impeccable, sometimes irreversible,

26:04.880 --> 26:08.640
cannot be distinguished from content that could have been produced by a human being,

26:09.280 --> 26:14.880
but also the understanding, the interpretation, the context, the why it matters of their content.

26:14.880 --> 26:22.080
Now, boilerplates are exactly what they are. And if there's something in a, for example,

26:22.640 --> 26:29.120
encyclopedia entry or Wikipedia entry, that matters is exactly, is objectivity, is luck,

26:29.120 --> 26:35.440
insofar as we can do that, of interpretation, of an angle, almost like as if the author had to

26:35.440 --> 26:45.840
disappear. But that is exactly where tools like GPT number will excel. It would be different if

26:45.840 --> 26:54.000
we were talking about the way in which an artist, a writer, or anyone simply putting notes in

26:54.000 --> 27:00.560
her own diaries, is going through the process of verbalizing, conceptualizing the experience, etc.

27:00.560 --> 27:07.680
So ultimately, allow me another analogy. There's a reason why, although we could have

27:07.680 --> 27:13.440
the best director and the best orchestra performing that particular concert in the hall,

27:14.080 --> 27:19.680
or just a recording that you had to play, we don't. And we can't get a few, a bunch of kids

27:20.400 --> 27:26.000
in a choir and a few people who are rather amateurish here in Oxford and do a good job,

27:26.000 --> 27:30.880
but certainly not as good as it could have been done by professionals. Is the human experience

27:30.880 --> 27:34.480
that matters? It doesn't matter whether you could do that, better by having a tool.

27:35.600 --> 27:42.480
Given the pollution of the infosphere with data generated from large language models,

27:42.480 --> 27:44.720
what are the ethical implications on society?

27:46.960 --> 27:53.120
There are quite enormous, I mean, the responsibility on so many fronts. This responsibility,

27:53.120 --> 27:58.320
of course, of the source of this pollution. And by the way, we know that the actual sources are not

27:58.320 --> 28:06.560
many. It's not that each of us is constantly pouring, providing extra bits of misleading

28:06.560 --> 28:13.840
information and lies. We do inadvertently repeat and reverberate that, but the actual sources of,

28:13.840 --> 28:20.960
say, for example, Russian propaganda are very few and well known. And likewise, you know,

28:20.960 --> 28:26.640
on many other contexts. So first of all, a huge responsibility on those who are polluting the

28:26.640 --> 28:34.800
environment. They are few, they are powerful, and they should be curtailed, shall we say,

28:34.800 --> 28:40.960
if not entirely stopped. Huge responsibility on people who could legislate much better,

28:40.960 --> 28:48.000
and more firmly. Look at the current debate, people listening to this and watching this should

28:48.000 --> 28:52.560
look at the date, but look at what's happening these days to Twitter. I mean, the debate is open

28:52.560 --> 28:57.200
about whether it's going to be a source of information or misinformation, and who should

28:57.200 --> 29:01.920
be there or shouldn't, etc. How much do we want to control? How much do we want to not filter?

29:01.920 --> 29:07.440
But also how our responsibility as a society, we should demand more, and we should be more

29:07.440 --> 29:12.160
careful. So if you put together all these responsibilities between the producers, those

29:12.160 --> 29:18.960
who take advantage of it, the consumers, we are all in on this. No wonder, it's a mess.

29:18.960 --> 29:22.480
But as I said at the beginning, we could rectify it with a bit of goodwill.

29:24.240 --> 29:30.160
No, you wrote an article in Aion a few years back called Should We Be Afraid of AI?

29:30.160 --> 29:35.840
And the risk debate has been ongoing since the 1960s when Irvin John Goode prophesied a potential

29:35.840 --> 29:42.320
intelligence explosion that could leave humanity behind. And on one side of those who believe in

29:42.320 --> 29:49.040
true AI, the Church of the Singularitarians, as you wonderfully described them. And on the other

29:49.040 --> 29:53.600
side, you have those who do not believe in true AI, known as the Church of the Atheists,

29:53.600 --> 29:59.280
sort of that spell AI, which is absolutely delicious. And you said we should remain

29:59.280 --> 30:03.920
tolerant of both views. But the real challenge is to ensure that AI is used in a way that

30:03.920 --> 30:09.600
does not undermine human dignity. And you said the dogma of the Singularitarians consists of

30:09.600 --> 30:16.240
three beliefs. The creation of some form of AI is likely and humanity will be dominated by it.

30:16.240 --> 30:19.840
And it's the responsibility of the current generation to ensure it's benign.

30:21.440 --> 30:28.640
So you said that Singularitarianism is implausible. It relies on weak senses of the possibility

30:30.080 --> 30:35.760
of possibility and Moore's law, and it distracts from the real evils. It's almost an indulgent

30:35.760 --> 30:43.040
of the Western elite. So what can be done to ensure that Singularitarianism is not a distraction?

30:44.560 --> 30:51.120
I'm afraid that the only cure there will be history, meaning that as we move on,

30:52.000 --> 30:58.400
we will see that AI in its variety of forms, natural language processing,

30:59.600 --> 31:07.440
robots, even little gadgets that can help us to do this and that in our mobile phone,

31:07.440 --> 31:11.680
I mean, that they improve say communication or enable us to take a better picture,

31:12.240 --> 31:18.080
the recommended systems that you find on Netflix, et cetera, and all these things we will see as we

31:18.880 --> 31:27.440
move on and grow up, that what has really happened is absolutely extraordinary,

31:27.440 --> 31:35.600
but not extraordinary as the Singularitarian thing it is. We're actually separating and

31:35.600 --> 31:41.520
increasingly so the ability to do these things and to solve problems, take care of tasks

31:42.160 --> 31:48.480
successfully in view of some goal, some end, from any need to be intelligent in doing so,

31:48.480 --> 31:53.040
that is extraordinary. This divorce between agency and intelligence, that is amazing.

31:53.600 --> 31:57.520
And if anyone doesn't want to speculate, just think about chess playing. I mean chess playing

31:57.520 --> 32:02.880
today is done at zero intelligence, at least I hope people will admit that my iPhone doesn't think

32:03.760 --> 32:11.760
any bits, anyone I can encounter. So extraordinary ability that would require

32:11.760 --> 32:17.600
intelligence if I were to play that way, I wish I could, but that it can be done as zero intelligence.

32:17.600 --> 32:24.640
Now, as we learn more and more that there is the delta, the gap that we are building,

32:24.640 --> 32:29.760
and these two things will go further and further away as we move on, things in terms of what we

32:29.760 --> 32:35.840
just said in terms of large language models and the GPT and the other ones that are quick

32:35.840 --> 32:43.680
following from other companies without advertising for anyone. We will find any Singularity narrative

32:43.680 --> 32:50.960
science fiction, I mean entertaining at some point, frustrating at others, because as you said,

32:50.960 --> 32:58.400
it is also distracting. We have plenty of problems generated by this divorce. If you have an enormous

32:58.480 --> 33:06.000
new force or source of agency in the world, at zero intelligence, that requires intelligence,

33:06.000 --> 33:12.080
hours, governance, law, ethics, a sense of what is the human project you want to build,

33:12.800 --> 33:19.920
and meanwhile you're worried that your car would run away with your credit card to have a holiday

33:19.920 --> 33:25.920
on a beach, well then certainly frustration starts building up because we're not taking care of the

33:25.920 --> 33:31.760
real issues. Now, the discrimination, the digital divide, the amount of things that we're not doing,

33:31.760 --> 33:38.480
no, sort of opportunity cost, wherever we are lacking a clear framework and so on. So Singularity,

33:38.480 --> 33:44.400
I mean like all churches, I think they will become increasingly old and they will not die,

33:44.400 --> 33:50.080
I mean they will always have a few faithful ones, but hopefully will not be in the headlines,

33:50.080 --> 33:54.640
which is one of the reasons why people like to push forward the Singularity so that they get the

33:54.640 --> 34:00.800
headlines. In terms of the end game though, you might argue that they have a point, I suppose

34:00.800 --> 34:05.840
you're arguing that, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but you just spoke about the industrialized

34:05.840 --> 34:10.640
attenuation of our agency and that maybe that's analogous to saying we're becoming increasingly

34:10.640 --> 34:18.320
enslaved by technology and our children's generation much more so than we are. So in some sense,

34:19.200 --> 34:24.480
would you argue? Oh no, it would be like saying, well I mean you could read that in terms of the

34:24.480 --> 34:31.360
engine and wonder whether the engine and the whole industrial revolution and urbanization coming

34:31.360 --> 34:39.280
say from model engine and so on has been liberating, has been enslaving, has been a good thing, a bad

34:39.280 --> 34:46.720
thing, has all real historical and real philosophical issues. It's a mix back and you can't simply say

34:46.720 --> 34:54.080
oh no, I wish the car had never been invented, really like I'm not quite sure, but on the other

34:54.080 --> 34:58.640
hand the damage that we are caused to these environments, so same with the AI. Now one could

34:58.640 --> 35:04.080
say I wish people had never taken this genie out of the particular bottle, really like the kind

35:04.080 --> 35:10.080
of things that we can do thanks to this. Think of one case, just a simple case, like cold fusion,

35:10.080 --> 35:16.400
I mean today if there is even a remote chance to get there is because of machine learning.

35:17.200 --> 35:23.120
We will never get there without the enormous abilities of computational problem solving

35:23.120 --> 35:32.240
provided by AI and so forth, so this case too requires more commitment, more sort of human

35:32.240 --> 35:37.920
intelligence, more governance, not less. So sometimes I find that debate becomes a little bit of a

35:37.920 --> 35:42.960
deterministic kind of debate between things that people who think they were doomed and things

35:45.040 --> 35:51.040
rosy glasses think oh it's going to be a wonderful world, well honestly it just up to us. The crude

35:52.480 --> 35:58.000
painful sort of truth is that unless we do something about it, it will be a mess, but if we do

35:58.000 --> 36:02.960
something about it and we do it rightly, well then we can do an enormous amount of good things for

36:02.960 --> 36:09.440
this, no at last point just to have some references, just look at the impact of AI in a variety of forms

36:09.440 --> 36:15.920
again on the sustainable development goals has been already significant, could do so much more

36:15.920 --> 36:21.520
at the same time, how much energy goes into development these sort of large language models,

36:21.520 --> 36:27.680
huge, are we really doing the best with this sort of consumption and impact when then if we

36:27.680 --> 36:34.240
were to use this for example for entertainment, for advertisement, when every bit of electricity

36:34.240 --> 36:39.440
out there should be carefully considered, even impact on the environment, these are real issues,

36:39.440 --> 36:45.200
but they are philosophical issues for human beings. Is there a way that we can embrace this

36:45.200 --> 36:53.200
technology in a way that preserves human dignity? I think so, the question is not however to simplify

36:53.840 --> 37:01.760
in terms of human-centric, because what reason maybe we can explore later, but we have done

37:01.760 --> 37:06.880
too much of that precisely because we have been so human-centric, we have destroyed this world,

37:06.880 --> 37:15.760
we have killed the environment, we should be more sort of at the service of both the natural and the

37:15.840 --> 37:22.960
sort of man-made artificial environments as well, so to me the best way of using technology

37:22.960 --> 37:30.400
is by respecting as we said before human dignity, but also using technology to the benefit of

37:31.120 --> 37:36.000
quote-unquote the other, which could be future generations, it could be the environment,

37:36.000 --> 37:42.480
it could also be us taking it as humanity, but not just us, if we use technology just for us

37:42.480 --> 37:46.320
and our own benefit, we will ignore future generations, we will ignore the environment,

37:46.320 --> 37:52.560
and we will not have done a full decent job, so yes there is, but it takes a little bit more

37:52.560 --> 37:57.360
of a commitment that we have at the moment. What form of governance do you advocate for?

37:59.760 --> 38:06.080
To me the governance that we could develop would inevitably leverage this digital revolution by

38:06.960 --> 38:13.840
offering, not imposing, not expecting, offering more participation at the beginning of the

38:13.840 --> 38:19.040
decision or process, so these are two distinctions that go against the right democracy, I'm not

38:19.040 --> 38:26.400
advocating for the right democracy, I'm saying offering so cannot be expected or compulsory,

38:26.400 --> 38:33.360
but plenty of offer at the beginning, not at the end, take a referendum, a painful memory here,

38:33.520 --> 38:41.120
we are in the UK, a referendum is not the right democracy, why? Because you can't choose between

38:41.680 --> 38:48.720
A and B, if you dislike both A and B, someone has prepared the alternative for you, the real

38:49.360 --> 38:56.000
democracy that is co-designing of the choices, not the options at the end, but the initial

38:56.000 --> 39:04.320
choices is the one that says, should we consider a referendum or blah blah blah, so the point here

39:04.320 --> 39:11.440
is that the earlier the involvement, the better is to live in that kind of society, so the governance

39:11.440 --> 39:18.320
that I'm advocating is a governance that has as early as possible involvement of people in a

39:18.320 --> 39:27.120
co-design of the choices that we face, now that, and I was here sorry but it's a huge topic, that

39:28.240 --> 39:34.480
means that behind this particular sort of mechanism, there's a separation between

39:35.280 --> 39:44.960
those who have power, the people, and can delegate power, and those who exercise power but don't

39:45.040 --> 39:53.280
have it, this structural separation between having power without exercising and exercising power

39:53.280 --> 40:01.520
without having it, that to me is the ABC of any decent governance, governance fails, especially

40:01.520 --> 40:07.520
political governance, no in the democratic sense of governance, fails the moment you have those who

40:07.520 --> 40:12.400
have power exercise it and those who exercise it have it, it doesn't matter whether it's a majority,

40:12.400 --> 40:18.480
it's minority, it's an oligarchy, it's three people, it's one person, it's a family, it's a tyranny

40:18.480 --> 40:23.920
of a few people, maybe only one, as soon as you separate this then we start having the right

40:23.920 --> 40:29.440
governance, then we can talk about involvement in the decisional process as early as possible,

40:29.440 --> 40:35.200
then co-design, and therefore for all this the kind of technology that we have, this is doable if we

40:35.200 --> 40:41.280
want to implement it. One thing that concerns me is that when we talk about the architectural

40:41.280 --> 40:49.440
design of governance, the structure can sometimes exclude other parts of the complex world that

40:49.440 --> 40:54.320
we live in, and also there's this compatibility with the Demos which is to say it needs to be

40:54.320 --> 41:00.320
intelligible, and then you have this problem of people voting in their own self-interest,

41:00.320 --> 41:07.120
even if they did understand the purpose of the governance. True, and we know that self-interest

41:07.120 --> 41:13.680
can go only there far, we learned that from the past century, the 20th century, the 20th century

41:13.680 --> 41:19.280
has been the century, especially the second half, so stuff has been a disaster, the second half much

41:19.280 --> 41:26.080
more successful, has been the century of the citizen-consumer, and therefore the self-interest

41:26.080 --> 41:32.560
as a citizen voting for the best options, making a difference, and therefore competition between

41:32.560 --> 41:37.200
different parties etc, and the consumer having the same kind of choices, voting quote-unquote with

41:37.200 --> 41:41.680
his note, that what they feed so to speak, choosing their restaurant or another, their shop

41:41.680 --> 41:48.480
rather than another, their product or another, but this figure that was the selfish interest

41:49.680 --> 41:59.040
consumer slash citizen has become not the user and the follower, so today instead of having

41:59.040 --> 42:04.320
citizens we have sort of followers, instead of having consumers we have users, and therefore

42:04.320 --> 42:13.280
there has been sort of impoverishment of precisely their selfish sort of interest, the caring for

42:13.280 --> 42:18.400
my individual project, which is one of the two legs for democracy, so their leg has become weak,

42:18.960 --> 42:25.520
the other leg is absent, which is the social side, so at some point society should also invite,

42:25.520 --> 42:34.640
facilitate, support, so nudge gently towards more not social solutions, for the simple fact that

42:35.440 --> 42:41.760
if we need to be more ambitious in our goals, we need to get together, it's not enough to not pursue

42:41.760 --> 42:46.960
our own self-interest, we have to pursue interests that are shared, so imagine the following picture

42:46.960 --> 42:53.040
out of this quick analysis, two legs, one has become weaker, the selfish interest for my individual

42:53.040 --> 42:58.800
project, the other one which is a social project is not there for obvious reasons, when we tried in

42:58.800 --> 43:05.760
the first half of the last century, it was the most horrible episode in human history, the Nazi,

43:05.760 --> 43:12.800
the Soviet Union, no democracy going out of the window, I mean Auschwitz, I mean we have created

43:12.800 --> 43:22.000
the most horrific possible nightmares that humanity has ever seen, so on this not so well

43:22.160 --> 43:29.360
so established body of democracy which has one leg missing, at the other one we, there's a lot of

43:29.360 --> 43:35.760
work to be done, we can do a better job reinforcing a sense of individual projects, what we call not

43:35.760 --> 43:45.680
more selfish interest, yes, and no, instead of no, either or instead of weakening it, reinforcing it

43:45.680 --> 43:51.520
and balancing it with a social project, the idea that no, if you get together you can do so much

43:51.520 --> 43:56.160
more and so much better than just by yourself, finally an example, if that car, and I've used

43:56.160 --> 44:01.520
that more than once, forgive me, but if that car doesn't start, it's totally pointless for you to go

44:01.520 --> 44:06.240
and push and come back home and say I've done my duty, it has to be the five of us, and it has to be

44:06.240 --> 44:14.320
the five of us, one, two, three, push, coordinated, so we need to have a society that increases the

44:14.320 --> 44:20.640
support for individual projects and has a good liberal democracy and counterbalances that with

44:20.640 --> 44:26.480
social common projects, so there we have both, now normally you find this a little bit more sort

44:26.480 --> 44:33.360
of developed in, no, western social democracies of a Scandinavian kind, now I wonder everybody

44:33.360 --> 44:39.520
wants to get there, I think you would agree, I mean Chomsky spoke to this but that you know

44:39.520 --> 44:45.760
market forces as well as technological forces reontologize us, I want to pick up on this word

44:45.760 --> 44:51.280
reontologize, I think it's an amazing word, I'm just going to scroll down to this, but yeah you

44:51.280 --> 44:56.640
said that once digital immigrants like us are replaced by digital natives like our children,

44:56.640 --> 45:02.560
the immigration will become complete and future generations will increasingly feel deprived,

45:02.560 --> 45:07.840
excluded, handicapped or poor whenever they're disconnected from the infosphere like fish out

45:07.840 --> 45:12.800
of the water, you said that information and communication technologies are reontologizing

45:13.520 --> 45:20.080
which is an even more extreme form of re-engineering us in our society which is to say its intrinsic

45:20.080 --> 45:25.200
nature is being transformed, you said that we're modifying our everyday perspectives on the ultimate

45:25.200 --> 45:32.000
nature of reality that is our metaphysics from a materialistic one, you know in which physical

45:32.000 --> 45:38.000
objects and processes play a key role to an informational one, so let's I mean you know

45:38.000 --> 45:44.800
explain your rationale but I love this word reontologizing, yeah well this comes from a very

45:44.800 --> 45:52.640
Kantian anti-metaphysical perspective, I find any metaphysics of the bad kind that Kant was talking

45:52.640 --> 45:58.640
about beyond my comprehension, it's something that I just don't quite get, I mean how people

45:58.640 --> 46:04.960
can possibly believe that they have a direct line with being capital B and being told by being,

46:04.960 --> 46:14.480
what is like to be being is beyond me, so I'm afraid on that front I am rather deaf and I understand

46:14.480 --> 46:20.560
that it might be my limitation, I rather speak, sorry when I use the word metaphysics that's

46:20.560 --> 46:25.920
what I mean, the Kantian kind of thing that you don't do because it's meaningless to do it,

46:26.560 --> 46:32.320
there's also a lot of no kind of Vienna circle kind of an analytic philosophy in all this but

46:32.880 --> 46:41.680
ontology on the other hand is how we structure the world in the sense that we think that that's

46:41.680 --> 46:48.400
the way it is, so with the kind of eyes we have and the kind of light around the world

46:48.400 --> 46:53.600
that those are the colors we perceive, to me the colors in the world are part of the ontology of

46:53.600 --> 46:58.400
the world they're not, nothing to do with metaphysics, it's not the way things are in themselves,

46:58.400 --> 47:04.080
no woman and etc, I have no sense of what we're talking about but certainly a world full of

47:04.080 --> 47:10.800
colors is the world which I take it to be, the world, that's my ontology, now reontologizing

47:10.800 --> 47:18.080
means changing some of that particular nature, allow me a distinction so I hope it's not too

47:18.080 --> 47:24.480
confusing, reality in itself call it system, description of reality as we perceive it,

47:24.560 --> 47:30.320
enjoy it, conceptualize it, live through, model of the system, ontology to me is the ontology of

47:30.320 --> 47:35.440
the model, it's not the metaphysics of the system, I hope I haven't made a complete mess here,

47:35.440 --> 47:42.720
okay, so metaphysics no manom system, whatever the source of the data that we get, fantastic,

47:42.720 --> 47:47.680
the data don't speak about the source, the music of the radio is not about the radio,

47:47.680 --> 47:52.480
but there is a radio, of course the music is what we perceive, the music has its own ontology,

47:52.480 --> 47:59.360
structure etc, the model, the model is at that point what we enjoy, why the digital revolution

47:59.360 --> 48:05.760
has changed the nature of the world around us, not metaphysically but ontologically, so the

48:05.760 --> 48:11.120
reontologizing, because some of the things that we have inherited from modernity, and I really mean

48:11.120 --> 48:15.200
modernity in the ordinary sense, no three or four centuries depending on whether you have a

48:15.200 --> 48:22.160
large short medium modernity from Columbus onwards or bit shorters, first world world,

48:22.240 --> 48:28.640
your size, your preference, but modernity, we have been added from modernity a sense of the world

48:28.640 --> 48:36.320
that is now being restructured and a certain understanding of the world, so re-epistemologizing

48:36.320 --> 48:44.080
as well of that world, two simple examples, modernity onwards, which I know I've used in the past,

48:45.040 --> 48:52.560
we have grown up with the idea that law and territoriality are two sides of the same coin,

48:53.760 --> 48:58.640
you can't simply separate them, my place, my rules, your place, your rules,

48:58.640 --> 49:04.880
if from Westphalia onwards, that's the ABC of any legal system for a long long time,

49:04.880 --> 49:12.320
the law ends where the territory of that particular state that issues the law ends, no, at the border,

49:13.280 --> 49:18.160
so law and territoriality, two sides of the same coin, or two sides of the same piece of paper,

49:18.160 --> 49:22.320
you can't cut one without cutting the other, of course, that's the ontology of the world in which

49:22.320 --> 49:29.520
I live, welcome to cyberspace, right to be forgotten, our whole debate and today we know that actually

49:29.520 --> 49:35.200
law and territoriality are no longer two sides of the same coin, they've been completely decoupled

49:35.200 --> 49:40.560
and you cannot have rules that for example are passed in Europe that apply to a search engine

49:40.560 --> 49:45.760
that is based in the United States and yet is only one click away, so the right to be forgotten was

49:45.760 --> 49:51.760
no, the moment when this became obvious, we were legislating about Google and Google not complied

49:51.760 --> 49:57.760
in Europe, the complaint was like well but it's not changing the way google.com is working, well

49:57.760 --> 50:01.760
the law doesn't apply there and of course there was a debate in terms of oh but it has to apply

50:01.760 --> 50:09.120
everywhere in the physical space, so the decoupling of the law and the territoriality is a reontologization

50:09.120 --> 50:14.960
of that particular space, we live in a different world, we perceive the world differently, conceptually

50:14.960 --> 50:19.920
we also start thinking differently, now let me give you a small example and I close here

50:21.200 --> 50:29.360
of a reontologizing of something we took absolutely for granted, right, if you have a taxi you have a

50:29.360 --> 50:35.280
license, if you have a license you can be a taxi driver, the two things go hand in hand

50:35.840 --> 50:43.680
and it's illegal etc, then Uber comes and having a car being allowed to give a lift to someone

50:43.680 --> 50:50.960
is decoupled from having to have the license as a taxi driver, a cab driver, this decoupling

50:50.960 --> 50:57.840
has generated an enormous amount of profit, problems, issues, a change in game and all of a

50:57.840 --> 51:04.960
sudden we realize yeah those two things were not completely one side of the other, so obviously

51:04.960 --> 51:10.480
this uberization of the world means decoupling things that we have taken for granted as a single

51:10.480 --> 51:16.880
unit from modernity or gluing together things that we thought were completely independent

51:17.520 --> 51:23.120
in the past, last example, personal identity, for a long long time we discussed personal

51:23.120 --> 51:31.840
identity, I mean philosophically speaking, as you like substance, soul, body, what the incarnation

51:32.320 --> 51:37.600
today if you look at anything that identities our data, that's the European legislation

51:37.600 --> 51:44.080
describes as data subjects, I am my information, privacy, the whole privacy debate is discussed

51:44.080 --> 51:51.440
in terms of what constitutes me as that body of information, privacy is a matter of getting my

51:51.440 --> 51:56.880
body almost, so why is this important because if you look and I close here at the European

51:56.880 --> 52:06.480
legislation how did they cope with the decoupling of space territoriality and law by coupling personal

52:06.480 --> 52:14.240
identity and data, personal data so that today the legislation does not say you do as you're told

52:14.240 --> 52:22.320
because it's my space but it says you do as you're told because this data are the data of the individual

52:22.320 --> 52:29.760
who is my citizen wherever you are, so decoupling, recoupling, new legislation this is

52:29.760 --> 52:35.280
incomprehensible unless you have this cut and paste in mind which is the reontologizing,

52:35.280 --> 52:42.000
reappease demologizing of modernity through the digital evolution, it's a big deal.

52:43.200 --> 52:49.280
The Uber example is absolutely beautiful and I can place myself in the startup and these folks

52:49.280 --> 52:54.400
think they're being incredibly disruptive and what you said is interesting, we used to talk about

52:54.400 --> 53:01.360
the mind-body dualism but now there's almost a kind of identity dualism, there's my digital

53:01.360 --> 53:07.120
identity and that is becoming increasingly as you say the only thing which matters but

53:07.120 --> 53:13.120
to close off this reontologizing thing, I'm not sure this might be a little bit tangential but

53:13.120 --> 53:17.520
Heidegger conceived of technology as an intermediation between us and our environment,

53:18.320 --> 53:24.000
I think in a similar way and it shapes the environment as much as it shapes us back

53:24.560 --> 53:29.440
and in a sense reliance on technology can make us less human which is kind of what you're

53:29.440 --> 53:34.160
relating to, is there an instructive contrast to Heidegger's analysis of the relationship

53:34.160 --> 53:41.280
between humans and technology and you're right? I think Heidegger was onto something when obviously

53:41.280 --> 53:49.600
technology is between us and the environment but allow me to be critical, he didn't see this

53:50.480 --> 53:55.760
seems to me clearly enough because that description, the description of a first order,

53:55.760 --> 54:00.640
what I like to call first order technology is essentially the very idea that between me and the

54:00.640 --> 54:14.640
tree there might be a sowing mechanism or between me and that particular sort of garden

54:15.440 --> 54:21.120
there might be a spade but increasingly unless the industrial revolution

54:22.000 --> 54:25.920
instead of having humanity and nature and technology in the middle you have humanity,

54:25.920 --> 54:32.640
technology and technology and that's a second order technology so we increasingly use more and

54:32.640 --> 54:37.920
more technology to deal with other technology and that's not in Heidegger, it's a second order

54:37.920 --> 54:44.400
technology but what AI does is to generate a third order technology where no between A and

54:44.400 --> 54:48.720
B and C is technology throughout so it's a computer controlling a robot building a car

54:49.840 --> 54:53.760
at that point we are outside that relationship and we can just control

54:54.560 --> 54:57.920
check that everything goes in the right way we are on the loop or after the loop

54:58.640 --> 55:04.800
at that point we can reinterpret the Heideggerian negative view of technology and say that is

55:04.800 --> 55:12.400
exactly where you want to be, you want to be outside the me technology nature or me technology

55:12.400 --> 55:18.800
technology I want to be on top of technology technology technology and see whether that goes in

55:18.800 --> 55:27.360
the right direction now it's even more powerful even riskier but with higher risks higher rewards

55:27.360 --> 55:34.000
it could also mean how humanity can actually take care of the world nature and itself properly

55:34.640 --> 55:40.960
now we would not be able to save this planet and ourselves from ourselves on this planet

55:40.960 --> 55:47.040
without technology it's inconceivable that now we can see at the end of the 21st century

55:47.040 --> 55:53.520
as a success by abandoning technology like seriously no more embedded technology but then

55:53.520 --> 56:00.240
we need to understand this no third order idea if we're still stuck in a sort of 19th century 19th

56:00.240 --> 56:07.040
century idea that it's between me and the world we're not gonna get out this final point obviously

56:07.040 --> 56:13.440
being on the loop or after the loop the designer of the whole loop comes with enormous responsibilities

56:13.520 --> 56:19.360
that's why ultimately to me it's not digital innovation but it's the governance of the digital

56:20.000 --> 56:25.440
that makes the whole difference digital innovation is it's it's not easy but it's not difficult

56:25.440 --> 56:30.080
especially if you have deep pockets you buy the next startup and the next no three kids who come

56:30.080 --> 56:36.800
up with a fantastic idea knowing what to do with that that takes a genius so um you said in your

56:36.800 --> 56:42.800
information book that John Wheeler coined the notion of it from bit and some physicists entertain

56:42.880 --> 56:48.800
an information based description of reality and you said that this informational metaphysics may

56:48.800 --> 56:55.040
but does not have to endorse a more controversial view of the physical universe as a gigantic digital

56:55.040 --> 57:00.560
computer according to which dynamic processes are some kind of transitions in computational

57:00.560 --> 57:06.640
states in a style described similarly by Putnam and or maybe I call it Turing machine functionalism

57:07.360 --> 57:13.440
so you pointed out the the ontological difference between imagining a stomach as if it were a

57:13.440 --> 57:19.360
computer versus holding that the stomach is actually a computer you said that there's a clear

57:19.360 --> 57:23.760
philosophical distinction between whether the physical universe might be modelled computationally

57:25.040 --> 57:29.040
is a different question to whether the ultimate nature of the physical universe might actually

57:29.040 --> 57:35.440
be digital and computational in itself so so what's your take I think the whole problem is ultimate

57:36.800 --> 57:42.480
we go back to this temptation of talking about reality as if you were something that we need to

57:43.360 --> 57:54.880
grasp catch portray hook uh spears um when in fact the the way I prefer to understand it is as

57:56.480 --> 58:02.720
malleable understandable in a variety of ways um something that provides constraints

58:03.440 --> 58:08.320
it doesn't mean that you can interpret in any possible way but leaves room for

58:09.440 --> 58:14.800
different kind of interpretations so if the flow of data that come from whatever is out there

58:15.520 --> 58:22.720
and again I'd rather be sort of agnostic about it can be modelled in a variety of ways um one way

58:22.720 --> 58:28.160
is to especially 21st century given the technology we have etc to interpret that as

58:28.160 --> 58:34.000
no an enormous computational kind of uh environment it's perfectly fine as long as we don't think that

58:34.000 --> 58:41.600
there is our right metaphysics is the correct ontology for the 21st century now this is not

58:41.600 --> 58:48.480
relativism because on the other hand different models of the same system are comparable depending

58:48.480 --> 58:53.280
on why you're developing that particular model and let me give you a completely trivial exam

58:54.080 --> 58:56.720
suppose you ask me whether that building is the same building

58:57.920 --> 59:03.920
that question has no real answer because it depends on why you're asking that question

59:03.920 --> 59:08.160
if your question is asked because you want to have directions I'm gonna say oh yeah it's the

59:08.160 --> 59:13.680
same building so the same building yeah absolutely no go there turn left no traffic lights up but if

59:13.680 --> 59:17.840
your question is like same function as I know it's completely different building it was a school now

59:17.840 --> 59:26.000
is a hospital next question so is it or is it not the same that that question is the mistake

59:27.200 --> 59:33.760
an absolute question that provides no interface what computer scientists call level of abstraction

59:34.560 --> 59:40.720
chosen for one particular purpose so that I can compare whether an answer is better than another

59:40.720 --> 59:44.960
let me crack a joke for the philosophers who might be listening to this huh there's your ship

59:44.960 --> 59:51.040
is it the same or is not the same who is asking why because if it is the tax man the tax man

59:52.480 --> 59:57.520
you're doomed man I mean there is no way you can play any who I change every plank that you're

59:57.520 --> 01:00:04.080
gonna pay that tax is the same ship I don't care but if it is a collector that ship is worth zero

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:09.280
you change all the planks you must be joking it's worthless so is it or is it not the same

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:14.720
depends on why you're asking that particular question tell me why and I can give you the answer

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:21.280
now why in other words no frame within which we have chosen the interface that provides the model

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:27.680
of the system no potential answer so the question is like is the universe a computational

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:37.520
gigantic yes or no meaningless is it worth modeling the universe as a gigantic for the purpose of

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:43.920
making sense of our digital life oh yes definitely because we are informational organisms aha so

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:50.080
metaphysics no I meant in the 21st century the best way of understanding human beings today

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:56.800
is as information organisms last century we thought that biologically not made much more sense a lot

01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:06.080
of water and sprinkle all the extra and so on mechanism the car time etc so not absolute answers

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:12.960
no relativistic answers but relational answers the relation between the question the purpose

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:18.080
and the actual answer but it takes three not two any absolute question absolute mess

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:25.040
this is so interesting I mean I spoke with David Chalmers recently and about the hard problem

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:30.640
and there was a thought experiment about maybe David lives in the matrix and one of the architects

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:35.840
came down to him and he said David you don't have the consciousness model installed we've

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:39.760
installed it on other people but we didn't bother installing on you but you're a philosophical zombie

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.800
or whatever and what would we need to do to to convince you that you're in a simulation and David

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.480
said well I'm outside the Empire State Building maybe if you turned it upside down I believe you

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:53.680
but but to be to be clear you're actually saying because I'm interested in this kind of

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:59.840
ontological distinction you're saying that even if we did exist in a computer simulation it wouldn't

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:06.160
make any difference it wouldn't it for the same reason that it doesn't matter whether we are in

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:14.480
God's mind as Berkeley's subjects it makes no difference because what you have lost there is

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:21.200
any traction by asking that particular question with anything that would provide any answer in other

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:29.520
words these are only sophisticated ways of playing as you lose tails I win find me a solution

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:36.400
you should stop engaging with these kind of questions is the trolley problem you should stop

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:40.960
engaging in that particular question because there is it but philosophers love those disposals

01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:46.640
now they imagine the possible world in which well as soon as anyone start talking about imagine a

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:52.560
possible world what are they I reach for my Kalashnikov or something else I I think we should

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:56.800
really not indulge in these kind of things not because they have wronged but because they are

01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:04.720
misused any real philosopher and I'm talking about this no 20 25 30 classics have been using

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:12.560
thought experiments logical possibilities for a purpose not in themselves you will not catch

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:20.400
they can't trying to solve the demon malicious demon problem that is a tool to get somewhere

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.760
is not something worth in itself same reason why now the trolley problem was developed to test

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:31.920
the particular theory not as a puzzling itself same reason why you know people are no no in a

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:38.720
matrix etc etc once again ask yourself what is the purpose for this particular question

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:46.480
because the purpose is a lot of mental enjoyment chess is much better beautiful well we've got

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:51.360
about two minutes left so I guess we'll have a closing statement but maybe also you could bring

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:57.040
in I mean I've got a machine learning audience so they would be interested in in in digital ethics

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:03.280
for example and and what they can do to learn more but also many folks are interested in getting into

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:09.280
digital ethics and philosophy so what what would you say to those people to the machine to machine

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:17.440
learning people I was always say like congratulations you are in the right business but secondly I

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:25.600
would say please don't forget where all this is going have a sense that these are not just toys

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:31.200
these are not just a matter of competition between one company another to have a larger model a faster

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:38.080
sort of computer a slightly improved quantum something and on and on we can go in a variety

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:41.680
of directions machine learning is one of the problems but think about the impact that they

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:47.920
will have on society on the environment and on individual lives it could be a fantastic impact

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:55.440
it could really make a difference in suffering in saving the environment or it could be a total

01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:03.760
disaster so please mind your machine learning and be a little bit more aware of the importance of

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:09.760
your job don't underestimate how crucial it is what you're doing you are providing the foundations

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:15.520
for the 21st century information society that is not small task we do that right we're gonna

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:20.880
not be thanked by future generations you we do that wrongly future generations may not be even

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:26.640
there but if they are there they would not be grateful so please not be careful what can be done

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:31.920
well one of the things that no this will end up with self-advertisement a little bit but one of

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:37.520
the things that we are going to do with the new center Yale is precisely opening the doors to

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:43.920
all disciplines and all practitioners because research and development today is done especially

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:48.720
in AI especially machine learning especially in digital context enormously more within

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:56.000
industry than sometimes in even the top universities so opening up having this translational no from

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:03.680
blue sky to product and multi-disciplinary open idea that it's a big table out there we need

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:09.120
everybody around the table the politician the lawyer the engineer the machine learning expert

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:15.440
the philosopher the ethicist the social scientist etc everybody around the table then that point

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:23.040
that I made the beginning will become a little bit more reasonable doing it together to improve the

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:30.160
world improve the chances of saving the environment ourselves can be done and I'm not sticking some

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:38.320
on my actual so neck out so to speak on this but it's something that I truly believe it's

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:45.600
entirely up to us and we can do this properly if we put ourselves into it professor Luciano

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:51.600
Florida it's been an absolute honor thank you so much thanks a lot thank you so much
