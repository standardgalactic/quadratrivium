00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
Hello everyone, I'm here to talk to you about a vision of artificial intelligence that goes beyond

00:05.680 --> 00:12.960
machines and algorithms. A vision which embraces humans and nature as integral parts of a cyber

00:12.960 --> 00:19.440
physical ecosystem of intelligence. A vision that is based on first principles derived from physics

00:19.440 --> 00:25.680
and biology. Professor Carl Friston just dropped a paper called Designing Ecosystems of Intelligence

00:25.680 --> 00:32.160
from first principles. And one of the principles is active inference, a formulation of adaptive

00:32.160 --> 00:38.320
behavior which can be read as a physics of intelligence. Active inference says that

00:38.320 --> 00:43.360
intelligent systems are those which can accumulate evidence for a generative model

00:43.360 --> 00:48.320
of their sensed world. In other words, they can learn from their observations and update their

00:48.320 --> 00:54.560
beliefs accordingly. They can also act on their environment to reduce uncertainty and achieve

00:54.560 --> 01:01.680
their goals. But active inference is not about individual agents. It also explains how ensembles

01:01.680 --> 01:07.600
of agents can share beliefs and cooperate through communication protocols. This leads to a formal

01:07.600 --> 01:15.040
account of collective intelligence that rests on shared narratives and goals. So how do we realize

01:15.040 --> 01:22.640
this vision? Friston proposes a research agenda for the next decade and beyond which aims to design

01:22.640 --> 01:29.040
such ecosystems of intelligence from scratch. They suggest developing a shared hyperspatial

01:29.040 --> 01:34.880
modeling language and transaction protocols as well as novel methods for measuring and optimizing

01:34.880 --> 01:41.200
collective intelligence. So why should we care about this vision? It's because it offers a way to

01:41.200 --> 01:47.280
harness the power of artificial intelligence for the common good without compromising human dignity

01:47.280 --> 01:52.400
or autonomy and because it challenges us to rethink our relationship with technology,

01:52.400 --> 01:58.800
nature and each other and because it invites us to join in a global community of sense makers

01:58.800 --> 02:03.840
who are curious about the world and eager to improve it. Enjoy the show.

02:05.520 --> 02:12.480
Our shared human journey is filled with examples of simple ideas that were nonetheless hard to

02:12.480 --> 02:21.520
discover and some that even once explained remain hard to comprehend. Their subtle simplicity

02:21.520 --> 02:29.040
belies their far-reaching and deep consequences. Examples might include the principle of relativity,

02:29.760 --> 02:37.680
quantum mechanics, the principle of parsimony and entropy. I think the free energy principle

02:37.680 --> 02:46.480
is another example, profound and far-reaching yet belied by its simplicity. It has on the one hand

02:46.480 --> 02:54.880
been dismissed as a triviality or even a tautology and on the other hailed as revolutionary

02:55.680 --> 03:03.760
and everything in between. It has the potential to reshape how we view the connection between

03:03.840 --> 03:12.720
inanimate matter and living things and even to answer the question of how and why consciousness

03:12.720 --> 03:20.960
and intelligence might emerge from physical matter and processes. That means a world where

03:20.960 --> 03:31.200
all things from particles to people to the largest systems all move or evolve according to two processes

03:32.000 --> 03:40.000
which combine. The first is a smooth flowing evolution. Think of planets orbiting a star

03:40.640 --> 03:48.800
or waves rippling over water or through quantum fields. The second is a random process that

03:48.800 --> 03:58.400
knocks around the smooth flow in unpredictable ways. Think of twinkling stars or audio static.

03:58.400 --> 04:07.600
You might think of these two processes as a kind of order and chaos or yin and yang forever

04:07.600 --> 04:18.320
intertwined and enmeshed. These two very different effects combine into a chaotic flow which may be

04:18.880 --> 04:26.160
entangled in a kind of tropical storm while still maintaining a semblance of structure

04:26.800 --> 04:34.800
and things. Think about raindrops undulating down to earth in a state of constant flux

04:35.600 --> 04:43.440
yet still droplets or a human being growing and adapting to the surprises of life

04:44.160 --> 04:52.400
all the while remaining an individual physical entity. Biology often asks the question

04:53.200 --> 05:00.960
what must things do in order to exist? Professor Friston has turned that question on its head

05:00.960 --> 05:10.400
and developed perhaps the ultimate existential formalism. He asks if things exist, what must

05:10.400 --> 05:17.200
they do? From the foundation of stochastic differential equations, Friston demonstrates

05:17.200 --> 05:24.400
that things which are defined by a Markov blanket must always move towards a pullback

05:24.400 --> 05:33.520
attractor, a special set of attracting states which maintains the integrity of the Markov blanket

05:33.520 --> 05:41.600
and therefore a thing's coherence and identity over time. One of the profound consequences

05:41.600 --> 05:50.480
of this is that the dynamics of such a system, its laws of motion, will manifest a form of flow

05:50.480 --> 05:59.040
dynamics which can be interpreted as Bayesian active inference. In other words, such a thing

05:59.040 --> 06:08.000
maintains an internal equivalent of a generative model encoding beliefs about the world and itself.

06:08.960 --> 06:16.640
The thing uses the model to decide actions and then performs a Bayesian update based on the outcomes.

06:18.000 --> 06:26.800
For me, the idea that inference, something widely perceived as purely abstract or mathematical,

06:27.600 --> 06:34.800
the idea that it can be driven by simple laws of motion dynamically maintaining the boundaries

06:34.880 --> 06:42.400
between things, maintaining order in the face of chaos is frankly astonishing.

06:44.160 --> 06:51.200
What's more, the free energy principle is so general that it applies at all scales of size

06:51.200 --> 07:00.240
and time leading to an ecosystem of things interacting across scales. Perhaps in that

07:00.240 --> 07:07.440
multi-scale active inference, we might finally find the keys to a mathematics of emergence

07:08.160 --> 07:16.000
and consciousness. This episode is sponsored by Numeri. I'm extremely grateful to them for

07:16.000 --> 07:21.280
sponsoring Machine Learning Street Talk. I mean, remember, I do everything myself on this channel.

07:21.280 --> 07:26.160
It's a lot of time. It's a lot of hard work. It's very expensive. I pay for other software licenses

07:26.240 --> 07:32.960
and all of the equipment. Having that support from Numeri means a lot to me and it means that I

07:32.960 --> 07:39.040
can keep doing what I'm doing basically. Thank you to Numeri. A little bit about Numeri, they are a

07:39.040 --> 07:45.520
data science competition platform to predict the stock market. They've already paid out over $50

07:45.520 --> 07:53.440
million for 5,000 models on their platform. They say that it's the highest paying data science

07:53.440 --> 07:59.200
platform in the world. Now, you can get started really easily for free. They've got a couple of

07:59.200 --> 08:06.000
examples on their GitHub repo actually using XGBoost. The data comes in parquet format so you

08:06.000 --> 08:11.600
can get up and running really easily. You can submit your predictions weekly or daily. You can do it

08:11.600 --> 08:18.720
either manually or you can do it automatically. They provide many, many years of back testing data

08:18.720 --> 08:24.160
as well so you can fine-tune and test your models and do a bunch of statistical diagnostics.

08:24.160 --> 08:29.600
You can work your way up the leaderboard for bragging rights and stake your model with their

08:29.600 --> 08:36.560
NMR cryptocurrency to earn rewards. Staking is a vote of confidence of your model and the reason

08:36.560 --> 08:43.440
they do that is to prevent overfitting and to reduce the bad models from contributing bad

08:43.440 --> 08:50.400
intelligence to their aggregate. Now, a well-performing model is rewarded in proportion to its stake

08:50.400 --> 08:57.440
but a poorly performing model is punished by burning a portion of the stake. Numeri have a

08:57.440 --> 09:03.040
huge community of data scientists of all levels swapping ideas and advice and they have some

09:03.040 --> 09:08.720
community forums as well which you should join. Now, just a personal note from me. This is a form

09:08.720 --> 09:14.080
of betting on the predicted performance of your models which can go up or down. Remember the data

09:14.080 --> 09:19.280
is abstracted from the actual performance of the stocks. They don't correlate to actual stock

09:19.280 --> 09:24.240
performance so there are folks on the platform who've made lots of money but there's also folks who

09:24.240 --> 09:29.760
have lost money as well so please be responsible and only stake what you can afford to lose and

09:29.760 --> 09:35.920
have confidence in. Try to have fun, use it as a place to sharpen up your data science skills

09:36.480 --> 09:41.680
and to be the best version of yourself and use all of the latest models that we've been talking

09:41.680 --> 09:47.840
about here on Street Talk. But yeah, anyway, thank you again to Numeri for sponsoring us.

09:47.840 --> 09:50.640
Professor Friston, it's an absolute honor to meet you.

09:50.640 --> 09:54.080
Well, thank you very much for having me. So we've had you on the show two times now

09:54.720 --> 10:00.560
and in the first show we went into exquisite detail about the free energy principle and active

10:00.640 --> 10:07.920
inference. So you're extremely famous for introducing this existential imperative which is to say

10:08.480 --> 10:14.480
if things survive what must they do? They gain information about the world around them in a

10:14.480 --> 10:20.640
cybernetic loop. We find a model which fits well while maintaining high entropy. If you have a

10:20.640 --> 10:26.240
high entropy model you have greater flexibility to adapt to new information. It's an absolutely

10:26.240 --> 10:33.600
beautiful idea. So welcome. Thank you. Nicely articulated. I was speaking with Keith yesterday

10:33.600 --> 10:38.880
and he said out of all of the guests that we've had on MLST you are by far his favorite and he

10:38.880 --> 10:44.320
says he looks up to you very much so he's very gutted that he couldn't come today to be part of

10:44.320 --> 10:50.400
this. It's very gracious of him though. So you just wrote a paper and it's called designing

10:50.400 --> 10:56.880
ecosystems of intelligence from first principles. You led with this white paper lays out a vision

10:56.880 --> 11:01.600
of research and development in the field of artificial intelligence for the next decade

11:01.600 --> 11:08.800
and beyond. It's denument, I wasn't sure if I was going to say that word, is a cyberphysical ecosystem

11:08.800 --> 11:15.040
of natural and synthetic sense making in which humans are integral participants what we call

11:15.040 --> 11:20.320
shared intelligence. This vision is premised on active inference the formulation of adaptive

11:20.320 --> 11:25.360
behavior that can be read as the physics of intelligence and which inherits from the physics

11:25.360 --> 11:31.680
of self-organization. So you went on and by the way there's an interesting link with Michael Levin's

11:31.680 --> 11:36.800
work here so we had him on the show recently and maybe even transhumanism as well we can get into

11:36.800 --> 11:41.920
that. But you went on you said in this context we understand intelligence as the capacity to

11:42.000 --> 11:47.680
accumulate evidence for a generative model of one's sensed world also known as self-evidencing

11:47.680 --> 11:53.920
over multiple scales and crucially you said active inference foregrounds an existential imperative

11:53.920 --> 12:00.960
of intelligent systems namely curiosity or the resolution of uncertainty and the same imperative

12:00.960 --> 12:07.600
underwrites belief sharing in ensembles of agents in which certain aspects which is to say factors

12:07.600 --> 12:14.320
of each agent's generative model provide common ground or a frame of reference. So can you sketch

12:14.320 --> 12:21.360
some of this out for me? Yes you've used all my favorite words though I presume that I actually

12:21.360 --> 12:28.320
used all the fact to be truthful Maxwell Ramsted was one of the key architect of this so this was a

12:29.120 --> 12:33.280
this white paper was a response to a brief just to think seriously and pragmatically

12:34.000 --> 12:39.360
how this sort of high church theoretical approach to you know intelligence and self-organization

12:39.360 --> 12:46.480
would play out in industry in the way that we actually use technology over the next decade

12:46.480 --> 12:52.640
and that white paper is a product of our machinations and discussions but just drilling down on the

12:52.640 --> 13:02.560
sort of basic message there. The emphasis was as you say on what it is to exist and how that

13:02.560 --> 13:10.800
would manifest in terms of intelligent behavior and to a certain extent certainly I and I think a

13:10.800 --> 13:17.040
number of the other co-authors were reading intelligence as the kind of inference that you

13:17.040 --> 13:23.920
would need to do in order to maintain your existence so hence the existential imperative.

13:23.920 --> 13:29.120
I have to say that's a slightly poetic interpretation of the free energy principle which

13:29.120 --> 13:34.080
is the other way around of course that if you exist it looks as if you are behaving intelligently

13:34.080 --> 13:40.880
if you read intelligence as the right kind of belief updating that enables you to maintain

13:40.880 --> 13:47.360
yourself in some characteristic state so that's essentially what that existential imperative

13:47.360 --> 13:55.520
was all about just one way of reading the physics the mechanics of systems that are open in open

13:55.520 --> 14:01.840
exchange with the rest of their world or their eco niche simply in virtue of the fact that they

14:01.840 --> 14:08.000
are around for an extended period of time and have this characteristic set of states that they occupy

14:08.000 --> 14:14.880
that defines them as the kind of thing that they are. I think the move really that was inspired

14:15.600 --> 14:21.280
by this remit to look okay well that's very nice you can write lots of papers about that and have

14:21.280 --> 14:27.680
nice chats with your friends and colleagues about it about how does that actually work in practice

14:27.680 --> 14:34.800
and of course in practice you have to think about where you're going to deploy this perspective

14:34.800 --> 14:40.560
deploy the kind of technology that would you know ensue from that perspective and of course we're

14:40.560 --> 14:45.600
talking about communication we're talking about a universal world of lots of creatures like me

14:45.600 --> 14:53.200
and you so now we get to the next level of application of these existential imperatives

14:53.840 --> 15:00.560
in the context of not just intelligent behavior and just open brackets behavior here

15:01.120 --> 15:10.160
it's quite important you know often I hear underwriting the move from AI artificial intelligence

15:10.160 --> 15:17.360
to IA where it's intelligent agents that have the artifacts with agency that do have behaviors that

15:17.360 --> 15:24.080
have a sentient kind of behavior or at least an intelligent kind of behavior close brackets

15:25.280 --> 15:34.400
so we're now moving from thinking about a single thing a particle or a person or a computer

15:34.960 --> 15:40.400
and thinking now about having lots of things that are talking to each other and they're

15:40.400 --> 15:46.400
coexisting so now we're in the world of distributed intelligence distributed cognition

15:47.520 --> 15:55.040
and one thing which you mentioned explicitly this notion of belief sharing so now we're in

15:55.040 --> 16:00.720
a different kind of world where we're thinking okay we think we understand the imperatives for

16:01.280 --> 16:08.000
good behavior the necessary kinds of behaviors that you know I think you highlighted curiosity I

16:08.000 --> 16:15.200
think is absolutely central in terms of you know hallmarking and characterizing the kinds of behaviors

16:15.200 --> 16:21.040
that you and I engage with or truly intelligent or sentient behavior would entail but now the idea

16:21.040 --> 16:27.120
is well what would that look like and when you've got lots of these things talking to each other

16:27.120 --> 16:31.440
well we know what it looks like we talk to each other literally so it's all about language it's

16:31.440 --> 16:38.560
all about belief sharing shared intelligence distributed cognition would be one thing that

16:38.560 --> 16:45.760
you might find in the in the life sciences if you're a computer scientist it's all about sort of

16:45.760 --> 16:53.840
the right kind of message passing on very very large factor graphs if you're if you're a linguist

16:53.920 --> 17:01.440
or into evolution in psychology it's all about neat cultural niche construction the

17:01.440 --> 17:06.800
emergence of language so I found that quite fascinating as something which you know you

17:06.800 --> 17:12.400
really had to get on top of to think well what next and what kind of technologies would you need

17:12.400 --> 17:20.000
to realize and what would they look like you know one way that's been framed to me by my new friends

17:20.000 --> 17:30.000
now in industry is you know what would what's it going to look like what what is AI or now AI going

17:30.000 --> 17:37.440
to look like in the future taking the kind of perspective you know over the decades or indeed

17:37.440 --> 17:42.800
centuries where you're moving from sort of the industrial age to the age of information I think

17:42.800 --> 17:47.520
the notion now is we're now coming to the end of the age of information now we're in the age of

17:47.520 --> 17:53.600
intelligence and think about what what that might look like and how would one equip people with the

17:53.600 --> 18:00.160
right kind of technology and infrastructure to you know to realize the potential of shared

18:00.160 --> 18:05.600
intelligence essentially yeah that's very interesting so we spoke with Luciano Floridi

18:05.600 --> 18:10.560
Oxford and he's invented this philosophy of information and he talks about the infosphere

18:10.560 --> 18:15.840
and how we're at we're out we now have third order technology essentially so things like Amazon and

18:15.840 --> 18:22.880
Facebook and he talks about the diminishment of our ontology and agency in the infosphere

18:22.880 --> 18:27.440
and using this information as a substrate thing I think is very interesting because that's kind

18:27.440 --> 18:32.400
of alluding to what you're going to but you said something actually in your paper which gave me

18:32.400 --> 18:38.400
pause for thought you said the the AI age may end up being a distributed network of intelligent

18:38.400 --> 18:44.400
systems which interact frictionally in friction frictionlessly in real time and compose into

18:44.400 --> 18:49.440
emergent forms of intelligence at subordinate scales as you were just alluding to and the

18:49.440 --> 18:55.200
nodes of such a distributed interconnected ecosystem may then be human users as well as

18:55.200 --> 19:01.200
human designed artifacts that embody or implement forms of intelligence now this really did make

19:01.200 --> 19:08.160
me wonder because I think we're already there now and so when when we had Floridion he was talking

19:08.160 --> 19:12.800
about how our digital identity has already distributed we were consumers and then we

19:12.800 --> 19:17.760
became barcodes and now there's this kind of infinite fractionation in the infosphere and

19:17.760 --> 19:23.840
it's almost as if humanity isn't the substrate anymore information is the substrate and he said

19:23.840 --> 19:29.360
you can devalue human skills you can remove remove human responsibility you can reduce human control

19:29.360 --> 19:34.160
you can erode human self-determination but the rock that thought that little drop of water was

19:34.160 --> 19:41.040
nothing 18 years later has a hole in it because drop after drop after drop the drop will shake the

19:41.040 --> 19:46.080
stone will shake the rock and I think what he meant by that is being ensconced and enmeshed in

19:46.080 --> 19:51.600
technology to such a high degree and information being the first class citizen in our society is

19:51.600 --> 19:57.360
kind of truncating our very existence I mean what would you say to that beautifully beautifully

19:57.360 --> 20:03.600
expressed very poetic and I'd have to think about that very carefully I'm sure there are deep truths

20:04.400 --> 20:11.200
and certainly from from the point of view of a physicist your information is obviously the thing

20:11.200 --> 20:18.160
it is it is in many respects the you know the substance of our universe and our existence and

20:18.160 --> 20:24.160
you're also acknowledging that energy is information and energy is just a potential and so

20:24.160 --> 20:29.680
we're all about we're all in the game of realizing potentials in a sort of folk psychology sense but

20:29.680 --> 20:35.920
also literally in terms of minimizing certain potentials for example self-information would be

20:35.920 --> 20:41.280
the free energy potential that you're that you're minimizing the surprise and again coming back to

20:41.280 --> 20:46.640
this sort of making you know belief sharing in the service of minimizing minimizing a surprise

20:46.640 --> 20:53.680
and realizing our potential so I but I don't see that as a negative thing I think that's just an

20:53.680 --> 21:00.720
acknowledgement that you know at the end of the day the way that we model and articulate and talk

21:00.720 --> 21:10.640
about ourselves our lived world whether we're a quantum physicist speak a statistical physicist

21:10.640 --> 21:17.280
or a classical physicist or have an interest in in the equivalent mechanics at each of those

21:17.280 --> 21:22.880
levels it's all about information it's all about the probability of being in this particular state

21:22.880 --> 21:28.400
you just take the the negative log of that that is the self-information of this particular state

21:28.400 --> 21:35.040
so it's all you know if you look at quantum physics you know what else is there it boils down to

21:36.000 --> 21:42.160
in its sort of most elemental and scale free or background free form and quantum information

21:42.160 --> 21:46.960
theory and say if you can reduce it to you know to quantum information theory which many people

21:46.960 --> 21:52.880
including friends of Mike Levin and I think one can then I think there's a there's a deep truth

21:53.600 --> 22:00.640
that we are just realizations of information particularly from my perspective of course

22:02.160 --> 22:11.280
we being a thing what what kind of information processing would be apt to describe us that could

22:11.280 --> 22:16.960
be you know articulate in terms of quantum information theory it's belief updating so we come

22:16.960 --> 22:23.040
back to the Bayesian mechanics that you can put on top of this underlying you know sort of information

22:23.040 --> 22:29.520
theoretic probabilistic description of the world but I guess I'm sort of reading between the lines

22:29.520 --> 22:35.360
and the twinkle in your eye is the idea that each one I get across is that maybe quite bad for

22:35.440 --> 22:40.480
humanity is that the idea is it all that's what that's what he thinks and I mean he thinks

22:41.360 --> 22:47.600
you're a computationalist you think that information is the kind of primary substrate

22:47.600 --> 22:52.000
and in a way he's also worried that information is becoming the primary substrate but the big

22:52.000 --> 22:57.440
difference between you and 3d is that he thinks that humans are special he thinks that we like

22:57.440 --> 23:03.200
can't we have autonomy we choose our own actions you know we can't be replicated in silica so he

23:03.200 --> 23:08.480
thinks essentially that there's no such thing as general intelligence that there's just algorithms

23:08.480 --> 23:16.080
that perform skills and it's our humanity which is being truncated I see right okay well I would

23:16.080 --> 23:22.960
be very sympathetic to that yes I mean we are special kinds of intelligence and one could

23:23.760 --> 23:28.480
equip that argument with you know what is the definition of sentience what's a bright line

23:28.480 --> 23:36.640
between you know a very clever thermostat or some machine learning artifact or a virus

23:37.680 --> 23:42.800
and you and me I think there is a bright line and you of course you've just said what it is it's

23:42.800 --> 23:49.760
the autonomy it's the agency it's ability to plan and the all the existential imperatives that

23:50.960 --> 23:56.000
underwrite that planning and then we come back to curiosity so but if he's saying that

23:56.880 --> 24:03.520
are the fact we are here realize the fact we are curious creatures and because we are

24:05.280 --> 24:10.640
we populate a universe that comprises creatures like us we're all curious about each other

24:10.640 --> 24:16.880
then I would certainly say yes that is a definitive aspect of us which is not found I think

24:18.720 --> 24:24.720
I'm just thinking carefully I'm sure you can find examples but you know I don't in the kind of

24:24.800 --> 24:31.120
artificial intelligence that we currently interact with in exchange with you don't have that planning

24:31.120 --> 24:40.240
and curiosity they don't have the you don't have bait into the optimization framing of you know

24:40.240 --> 24:46.720
what makes a viable or a good bit of intelligence you don't actually have bait in universally

24:47.760 --> 24:54.400
this expected information can this curiosity and in that sense I think he's probably absolutely

24:54.400 --> 25:02.720
right and in a sense the belief sharing getting to that the right kind of belief sharing of the

25:02.720 --> 25:08.880
kind that the white paper was talking about is predicated on the notion that you will now be

25:08.880 --> 25:15.760
able to equip sentient artifacts that we make with curiosity and maybe asking well what are

25:15.760 --> 25:20.560
they going to be curious about their world what is their world it's you and me and the other

25:20.560 --> 25:24.240
artifacts so they're only going to be curious about you and me they're going to be interested

25:24.240 --> 25:31.920
in you and me so we're talking about you know a Siri or a Google Maps that starts to ask you

25:31.920 --> 25:38.000
questions instead of you asking them questions so that I think that's that's one way of eluding his

25:38.000 --> 25:47.360
his sort of rather dystopian attitude to the other the information is king I think information is

25:47.440 --> 25:57.440
king belief updating is king the belief updating is you know of course the thing that ensues once

25:57.440 --> 26:03.680
you act upon the world to do some smart data mining to you know to respond to some epistemic

26:03.680 --> 26:12.400
affordances and you know the question then is you know what kinds of systems do that and the moment

26:12.400 --> 26:17.600
I would argue it's probably just us there are other examples of some beautiful examples in

26:18.720 --> 26:23.360
say active learning using machine learning you know to design your own experiments and

26:23.360 --> 26:30.880
optimize the actual experiments and say drug discovery or molecular biology so I mean that

26:31.760 --> 26:36.800
there is a long history both in statistics and in machine learning of active learning

26:36.880 --> 26:42.080
that I think does have the potential but I don't see it really being

26:45.120 --> 26:52.960
well from what I understand in discussions I don't see that being a bedrock of the way forward

26:52.960 --> 27:01.840
an explicit part of the design for an age of intelligence that is puts us sympathetically

27:01.840 --> 27:07.760
in an ecosystem of intelligence and that's really what that white paper was trying to think what you

27:07.760 --> 27:14.800
know what would it look like and what would happen if your google maps became very curious about you

27:14.800 --> 27:23.200
particularly I mean at google maps I think well there are two sort of sort of metaphors here

27:23.760 --> 27:35.200
which might sort of ground the framework or the perspective that I'm trying to think about this

27:35.200 --> 27:46.880
worry and one which I found very helpful again coming from my colleagues in industry is just trying

27:46.960 --> 27:57.360
to explain the nature of shared intelligence and distributed intelligence and the analogy here would

27:57.360 --> 28:03.520
be the brain you know you've got really smart little elements little neurons I mean they're

28:03.520 --> 28:08.880
really smart and in fact if you get into the weeds of dendritic computation incredibly smart little

28:08.880 --> 28:14.640
things that are in receipt of their sensations and they act by some pinging they don't know who

28:14.640 --> 28:18.640
they're pinging but they're pinging away sending out little action potential or messages down down

28:18.640 --> 28:26.000
the axons the wires that are emitted from from the nerve cells and you've got you know 10 billion of

28:26.000 --> 28:30.640
these things and they're all very very smart but would you call any one of them autonomous would

28:30.640 --> 28:37.360
be called would they have agency in an elemental sense I think they do but it's when you put them

28:37.360 --> 28:42.720
all together lots and lots of little smart things together do you get this emergent kind of intelligence

28:42.800 --> 28:51.120
that you could undeniably say has the capacity to roll out into the future to you know generate

28:51.680 --> 28:57.840
fantasies or counterfactuals that are all conditioned upon what I'm going to do next where

28:57.840 --> 29:06.640
I now becomes this collective so this is the kind of emergent behavior that emerges from

29:07.280 --> 29:12.240
getting lots of little smart things to talk to each other in the right kind of way so that

29:12.240 --> 29:16.720
that's you know I think quite a helpful analogy by what is meant between you know about shared

29:16.720 --> 29:22.640
intelligence and what might you know might arise clearly a lot of these little smart brain cells

29:22.640 --> 29:28.240
be analogous to you and me a lot of others would be all kinds of apps and you know

29:30.480 --> 29:38.000
giving you now the potential to see through the eyes of any smart app that knows what you want

29:38.000 --> 29:43.840
to know and is curious about what you want to you know to find out again coming back to this notion

29:43.840 --> 29:52.080
that belief sharing I think is already there in the context of say you know sat nav you know I

29:53.440 --> 29:59.680
share my beliefs about my preferred states of being my characteristic preferences are one part of the

29:59.680 --> 30:06.080
you know the imperative suite for policy selection or good plans I share that with in terms of a

30:06.080 --> 30:11.280
destination with some shared world model or shared narrative between me and my sat nav

30:12.720 --> 30:20.240
in this instance of a geographical world model and then it has beliefs about the best policy

30:20.240 --> 30:26.720
it makes a little plan and then it shares its beliefs with me again so I think that you know that

30:26.720 --> 30:32.640
to the extent that your colleague in Oxford was saying we're already there I think that

30:32.640 --> 30:36.320
that's absolutely right I mean you know we already have this kind of belief sharing

30:37.360 --> 30:45.680
I think that the move though is to make that a much more symmetric belief sharing you know

30:45.680 --> 30:51.200
I'm asking the app for its beliefs for its I'm asking it to behave as a recommender

30:52.560 --> 31:00.240
and it only knows what I tell it so it has no autonomy but if it was now in a position to

31:01.040 --> 31:08.400
actively smartly resolve its uncertainty about me the user then that's much more of a sort of

31:08.400 --> 31:15.680
you know a balanced symmetrical dynamic interaction between me and the app and the agenda here

31:15.680 --> 31:23.280
is not to create paper clips or make money the agenda remember is just to resolve uncertainty

31:23.920 --> 31:29.520
the state curiosity and to move towards the state of greater mutual understandings

31:30.960 --> 31:40.960
that's a sort of the non-dystopian view of information sharing so Shane Legg said that

31:40.960 --> 31:45.440
his definition of intelligence is the ability of an agent and we're using words here like

31:45.440 --> 31:50.080
agent we'll get to those words in a minute being able to solve a variety of tasks in different

31:50.080 --> 31:56.880
environments Francois Chorlet said it's efficiently creating abstractions given limited prize and

31:56.880 --> 32:04.720
experience Pei Wang says it's the adaptation efficiency over finite resources so when you

32:04.720 --> 32:09.520
look at definitions of intelligence typically they focus on principle and function which I think

32:09.520 --> 32:17.280
your one does or capability or behavior or structure now the interesting thing about the

32:17.280 --> 32:21.360
principle one in particular is I think it's the least anthropomorphic and I think yours is the

32:21.360 --> 32:28.160
least anthropomorphic definition I've ever heard of so and also this concept of grounding in the

32:28.160 --> 32:34.720
physicality of information rather than reality itself and whether they are the same thing of

32:34.720 --> 32:41.360
course is a philosophical discussion that maybe we'll park for another time but yeah how would

32:41.360 --> 32:47.840
you contrast your definition of intelligence from these other ones well I think you've already

32:47.840 --> 32:56.160
done that you've you've said it's you know it's a minimal essentially a physics based definition

32:56.160 --> 33:03.120
of intelligence which requires you know a move or indeed a complete commitment to staying in the

33:03.120 --> 33:11.200
space of information and information geometries and belief updating so having said that I think

33:11.200 --> 33:17.040
all of those definitions touch upon some essential aspects of intelligence every one of them rang

33:17.040 --> 33:26.160
true you know to my ears and I could read every one of those as being one key foundational aspect

33:26.160 --> 33:32.640
of what would emerge if any self-organizing system managed to supervise and coexist with

33:32.640 --> 33:37.680
other self-organizing systems from the point of view of you know of the free energy principle

33:38.240 --> 33:46.080
or the sort of first principle approach so there are no axioms and no assumptions the question is

33:46.080 --> 33:53.600
not you know what is quintessentially anthropomorphic the question is what emergent properties of

33:53.600 --> 33:59.920
certain kinds of self-organizing systems would qualify as having that that bimimetic and then

33:59.920 --> 34:05.360
ultimately anthropomorphic aspects to them you don't even have to go to anthropomorphism I mean if you

34:06.320 --> 34:13.040
were talking as you have been to Mike Levin and his friends you know they would talk about basal

34:13.040 --> 34:20.480
cognition they would talk about you know just a multicellular organism is a beautiful construction

34:20.480 --> 34:26.560
of that rests upon orthopoiesis self-assembly of individual cells but also cells of cells and

34:26.560 --> 34:31.520
you know how does a surface cell an epithelium know that he's on the surface and how does that

34:32.240 --> 34:39.040
individuate the internal cells of an organ or an organ from the rest of the environment so that you

34:39.040 --> 34:49.920
know the kind of intelligence that has this anthropomorphic feel I think people are also

34:49.920 --> 34:54.560
seeing in biotic self-organization that would be a long way away from the kind of

34:55.200 --> 34:59.280
folk psychology intelligence that we're talking about and yet it rests upon exactly the same kind

34:59.280 --> 35:04.480
of mechanics and you know for me that would be the Bayesian mechanics that come from the

35:04.480 --> 35:10.160
you know the dynamics of systems that are self-organizing open systems that are self-organizing

35:11.600 --> 35:22.400
so you know you talked about so adaptation has been one aspect one common theme in the

35:23.040 --> 35:28.480
the sequence of definitions you gave I think does speak to this bright line between

35:29.440 --> 35:34.880
basal cognition and biotic self-organization biological intelligence of the kind you can

35:34.880 --> 35:41.520
read in many many different ways your your DNA for example your genotype is an intelligent

35:41.520 --> 35:48.320
information accumulating device on the point of view of evolution you know it it stores all

35:48.320 --> 35:53.760
the information about what it would require to build a phenotype that's fit for purpose in this

35:53.760 --> 35:59.280
particular environment so you know that's a kind of belief updating that's a kind of intelligence

35:59.280 --> 36:03.200
but it doesn't have what we were talking about before which is this capacity to plan

36:03.760 --> 36:09.120
evolution doesn't plan you could also argue that the the worldwide web doesn't plan

36:10.880 --> 36:14.880
google maps you could argue does plan to a certain extent because it's certainly

36:14.880 --> 36:20.960
so what's the difference the difference is I think implicit in at least the first two of your

36:20.960 --> 36:26.960
of your definitions which is this notion of counterfactual futures this notion of

36:28.080 --> 36:35.360
you know imagining a future or putting it another way having a world model or a generative model

36:36.560 --> 36:41.920
that explains things that are not tied to the moment so if you're a physicist what you're

36:41.920 --> 36:48.880
talking about is now a probabilistic mechanics a Bayesian mechanics or possibly just you know an

36:48.880 --> 36:54.080
information theoretic mechanics based upon paths through time so we're talking about things like

36:54.080 --> 36:59.600
the pathological formulation and you know but crucially we're talking about trajectories that

36:59.600 --> 37:05.440
don't cannot be localized to this point in time that necessarily entail the future and indeed the

37:05.440 --> 37:11.280
past so I've you know that notion of freeing yourself in a you know I can't remember the

37:11.280 --> 37:14.640
name the philosopher now I can't remember the name I just can't pronounce it so I'm going to pretend I

37:14.640 --> 37:21.280
can't remember well there are people who there are there are the philosophical schools that

37:21.280 --> 37:26.720
emphasise this temporality aspect now you know and if you just look at physics look at contributions

37:26.720 --> 37:30.720
of Richard Feynman for example it you know it's all about the pathological formulation

37:31.440 --> 37:41.200
and so I think as soon as you talk about the elements to which the information geometry

37:41.200 --> 37:48.480
as an intelligence and autonomy all of these things could apply are not states they are

37:48.480 --> 37:56.800
trajectories dynamics narratives paths that have this this sort of future pointing aspect

37:57.520 --> 38:05.360
um then being able to select among different futures becomes an emergent property of this

38:05.360 --> 38:11.680
kind of sense making this kind of autopoiesis under you're read as a Bayesian mechanics of

38:11.680 --> 38:16.800
self-organisation and just thinking about your definitions they all have that aspect of choosing

38:16.800 --> 38:24.880
among different futures or considering or having abstractions um you know about what might happen

38:24.880 --> 38:32.960
if if this so for me that that is one way of expressing curiosity because to be curious you

38:32.960 --> 38:38.720
have to imagine well what would happen if I did that and what would I know if I did that but you

38:38.720 --> 38:44.480
have to imagine it before it's actually happened which you know is is for me the big bright line

38:44.480 --> 38:50.880
between you know between the anthropomorphic kind of intelligence and the intelligence you find in

38:50.880 --> 38:58.320
the thermostat or in the you know a variation autoencoder yeah um later on we will decompose

38:58.320 --> 39:03.520
the different aspects of cognition and I think as well as thinking it can be knowing and acting

39:03.520 --> 39:09.840
as well and and we'll we'll talk to that but you said words you know action agent per se

39:09.840 --> 39:17.680
goal plan behavior and I guess and I posed this to Levin as well it feels like these are terms

39:17.680 --> 39:22.240
that we understand because we have cognitive priors like agentiveness and so on these are

39:22.240 --> 39:28.400
things that that we understand that might actually only be a lens into something far more complicated

39:28.400 --> 39:35.200
and just to touch on the information traversal points over a geometry that's very interesting

39:35.920 --> 39:41.280
and I'm no expert but I think the medial temporal lobe deals a lot with spatial

39:41.280 --> 39:48.160
contiguity and we have grid and place cells etc etc so it you know at a macroscopic level

39:48.160 --> 39:53.120
in our brain it's a first-class citizen but there's also this hierarchy isn't there

39:54.080 --> 39:59.120
when does it start happening you know do single cell organisms plan into the future

40:00.000 --> 40:06.480
and to the previous point is planning necessarily a reductive lens of intelligence

40:07.040 --> 40:13.360
you brought up loads of interesting things there you you call me by the reductive lens that's a

40:13.360 --> 40:18.240
lovely phrase what does that what does that mean well um I didn't mean it in a purer sense but

40:18.240 --> 40:26.160
when when we use words like you know like we we we say intelligence must do x y and z it must plan

40:26.160 --> 40:33.120
it must reason it must act and we have this cybernetic loop and so on and I I have a theory

40:33.120 --> 40:40.080
that this is just the way we understand things I see and and in a sense it's a lens onto a much

40:40.080 --> 40:45.600
more complicated thing and and the reason this is interesting is the reason why we have people

40:45.600 --> 40:53.920
like john so who says that the um the impenetrable realm of the subjective experience is beyond

40:53.920 --> 40:59.760
function dynamics and behavior it's a little bit extra and and even and morality is another example

40:59.840 --> 41:04.320
talk about that later that feels like it's something which is a little bit extra so there's

41:04.320 --> 41:09.760
always this question of to what extent is intelligent behavior deducible from the models and the

41:09.760 --> 41:18.400
words that we use yes I think that's a fundamental point uh you said um okay now I understand what

41:18.400 --> 41:23.440
a reductive lens is I like that I like them I like it for many reasons of course because um

41:24.160 --> 41:29.920
well first of all um it certainly is not uh you I don't think it could ever be used in a

41:29.920 --> 41:38.480
pejorative sense um but it does speak to um two fundamental themes which is um the the way that we

41:38.480 --> 41:46.640
do make sense of our world through coarse-graining through reducing uh through having um intuitive

41:46.720 --> 41:54.800
models of the way that the world works um ultimately could be um um seen as language

41:54.800 --> 41:59.920
words um could be I think could also be seen at quite to kind of as physics and maths as well

41:59.920 --> 42:06.880
to be quite honest um you know these these the more I read about you know modern mathematicians

42:06.880 --> 42:12.240
and physicists talking about that you know their skills and and the the legacies that they they

42:12.240 --> 42:18.320
enjoy the more I I realize it's all changing all the time it's just another kind of reductionism um

42:18.320 --> 42:23.520
but language particularly but it's a right kind of reductionism and I guess what you're saying is that

42:23.520 --> 42:30.960
you know um we have this um way of summarizing classifying certain kinds of behavior which may

42:31.600 --> 42:37.360
not truly reflect the underlying complexity the beauty of what's going on underneath

42:38.240 --> 42:42.640
that at that that point I would go the other way I would actually say that do not properly

42:42.640 --> 42:49.040
reflect the underlying simplicity of what's going on to be quite honest you know this comes back to

42:49.040 --> 42:56.080
you know the um unashamed use of phrases like sort of existential imperatives and self-evidencing

42:56.080 --> 43:00.560
yes yeah we're just here we're just we just have characteristic steps and sets we're just

43:01.280 --> 43:07.520
realizations of some glorious um launch of our equations and all these stories about sort of

43:08.240 --> 43:15.440
belief updating and sentience and intelligence and just reductive stories that make sense of

43:15.440 --> 43:23.760
you know what we you know what um what we must um or can if indeed to a certain extent the free

43:23.760 --> 43:28.080
energy principle itself I think is a reductive story of that kind you know when I say if you

43:28.080 --> 43:32.560
look at things through the lens of Bayesian mechanics or as if I think the free energy principle

43:32.560 --> 43:38.560
is another example of of this kind of reductive thing it's a looking at something which is inherently

43:38.560 --> 43:42.880
much more simple than the lens through which you're looking at which is the Bayesian mechanics

43:42.880 --> 43:48.400
and the free energy principle so I think that's absolutely right a really interesting idea um

43:48.480 --> 43:56.480
um so uh and at another level I think it speaks to some key issues you know I mean you're um

43:57.280 --> 44:04.800
you you're often um then confronted with you know okay I'm talking with you about agency

44:04.800 --> 44:13.120
and agents and me and you uh so what license is that what aspects of my implicit world model

44:13.360 --> 44:20.320
or generative model endow me with a sense of me and you and indeed me as agent and you know what

44:20.320 --> 44:27.920
would that look like if I stripped away um different levels of meta awareness or meta uh

44:27.920 --> 44:34.080
cognition if you're a psychologist and uh and just had a minimal selfhood um you know is just be

44:34.080 --> 44:40.960
having plans um sufficient to call me an agent even if I don't know if I'm an agent if I have plans

44:41.600 --> 44:48.320
who else is going to act you know enact those plans I mean I would love to go there slightly

44:48.320 --> 44:54.960
later but there's so much we can say about um agency and the boundaries and also the causal

44:54.960 --> 45:00.560
pressures between agents and also whether you can think of boundaries as being observer relative

45:00.560 --> 45:05.840
but I just really wanted to go to the universal um algorithm thing that you spoke about before

45:05.840 --> 45:12.240
because I think it's delicious so um I think it's fair to call you a universalist and that and that

45:12.240 --> 45:16.080
that's that there are quite a few universalists actually that these are people who think there's

45:16.080 --> 45:20.240
a simple underlying principle and this is in contrast to what we were just talking about

45:20.240 --> 45:26.640
which is that the reality is more complicated than we'll ever understand and we have a truncated

45:26.640 --> 45:32.800
cognitive horizon and we as Chomsky says we just have kind of um simple primitives built into us

45:32.800 --> 45:37.920
that help us frame and and understand a kind of abstraction space within a certain cone

45:38.560 --> 45:42.960
but um I was reading professor Christopher Somerfield's book at Oxford I interviewed him last week

45:43.600 --> 45:50.000
and he said in his book um could it be that the um success of mammalian brains is not due to any

45:50.000 --> 45:55.920
careful crafting into a mosaic of different functional subsystems but instead is merely due

45:55.920 --> 46:00.560
to size we know there's a powerful relationship between the sheer number of neurons and the

46:00.640 --> 46:06.720
complexity of behavior he went on he said researchers and neuroscientists alike such as

46:06.720 --> 46:12.480
Carl Friston and uh Jeff Hawkins and even Andrew Ng have flirted with the idea that there might be

46:12.480 --> 46:18.320
a single algorithm which underpins intelligence with the brain acting like a massive TPU repeating

46:18.320 --> 46:24.400
instructions ad nauseam to generate complex behavior so it's a fascinating idea is that a fair

46:25.040 --> 46:31.520
summation yes what's a TPU in this oh well a tensor pro programming unit it's a very

46:31.520 --> 46:38.880
powerful computer right yeah I learned another new acronym but my world is full of new acronyms

46:38.880 --> 46:49.600
right okay um yeah um so what which his argument there is it's something to do with um scale and

46:49.600 --> 46:56.400
size is is that well not not only that I mean we'll we'll get to there's a guy called Rich Sutton

46:56.400 --> 47:03.440
and he he had this um you know bitter lesson essay and it's a warning against hand crafting um

47:04.080 --> 47:09.360
structures architectures because it bottlenecks it doesn't scale so this universalist idea is that

47:09.360 --> 47:13.920
you know maybe and and Jeff Hawkins says the same thing he's got this thousand brains theory of

47:13.920 --> 47:19.840
intelligence yes and the idea is that there's a very simple underlying algorithm or principle

47:19.840 --> 47:26.960
and you just replicate it you scale it up or out and that produces emergent intelligence right

47:27.680 --> 47:40.880
yes well okay then I am a universalist so um you know but both of those the way you described it

47:40.880 --> 47:47.680
do speak to some I think very pressing issues about um structures and structure learning um

47:48.400 --> 47:52.880
that you know you could either um read from the point of view of machine learning and sort of

47:52.880 --> 47:57.280
graph learning what's the rights you know how many layers does this particular deep learning

47:57.360 --> 48:01.840
architecture need or what kind of factorization are going to put in play

48:04.800 --> 48:12.720
or if you were um you know um radical construct a radical constructivist this you know that that's

48:12.720 --> 48:17.520
where you know I've often heard people like Josh Tenenbaum for example think about sort of structure

48:17.520 --> 48:23.680
learning and um from the point of view of the universalist I've now learned that new word now

48:23.680 --> 48:31.600
that's good so as from as a universalist then you are certainly looking for the one principle

48:32.640 --> 48:42.720
that is redeployed at successive scales and that should be a sufficient explanation for

48:43.440 --> 48:51.280
those things that show emergent behaviors at particular scales so I think that you know

48:51.520 --> 48:57.680
that is absolutely true and again you can read this from the point of view of a mathematician

48:57.680 --> 49:02.880
from the point of view of um the renormalization group and what does that mean what it just means

49:02.880 --> 49:08.480
that you know if I take lots and lots of little things um and I start course training them in a

49:08.480 --> 49:15.520
particular way um then if I want to describe the behavior of all the elements at one um scale of

49:15.520 --> 49:24.800
organization say molecules or cells or people um then if I can write then down their dynamics

49:24.800 --> 49:30.880
in terms of say Lagrangian you know so some way of summarizing their dynamics that um and all the

49:30.880 --> 49:39.600
things that um accompany or ensue from those dynamics um then if I do my course training

49:40.480 --> 49:47.120
um and then look at the collective the average behavior of say lots of cells a place cell or

49:48.320 --> 49:54.080
entire medial temporal or entire person um at a more macroscopic level then I should

49:54.640 --> 49:59.120
be able to recapitulate the same functional form of the dynamics and all the Lagrangian

50:00.480 --> 50:06.720
so from that point of view um you have a particular kind of universalism that is

50:06.720 --> 50:12.000
actually scale free because you get the same principle emerging at every level and that that

50:12.000 --> 50:18.240
is basically um one um one way of looking at the deployment of the free energy principle

50:18.240 --> 50:22.240
is asking what would it look like when deployed at different scales so you can deploy it at the

50:22.240 --> 50:29.520
level of dendritic self-organization you can deploy it at the level um of um your uh neuroscience

50:29.520 --> 50:35.040
you could deploy it at the level of um morphogenesis and cellular pattern formation

50:35.040 --> 50:42.960
we've done that with Mike Levin um the idea being that this the same universal principle

50:42.960 --> 50:48.480
works at every every level then the interesting game comes between the coupling between the levels

50:48.480 --> 50:55.520
how does one level constrain um and inform or contextualize the level below and vice versa

50:55.520 --> 51:02.160
you know and this I think is a really important sort of um issue which is probably well rehearsed

51:02.240 --> 51:07.760
in many different disciplines ranging from say evolution so evolution as a free energy

51:07.760 --> 51:13.840
minimizing process where free energy is literally the um the the negative abound on the negative

51:15.440 --> 51:21.200
log marginal likelihood um I name it the likelihood of finding me this phenotype here

51:21.200 --> 51:27.360
when sampled at random from a population um how does that scale of a free energy self

51:27.360 --> 51:32.320
auto poetic process you know natural selection basic model selection if you're a statistician

51:32.320 --> 51:39.920
how does that provide constraints on the exactly the same principles um of active inference and

51:39.920 --> 51:48.000
learning um in developmental time for any given phenotype and then the that would be the top

51:48.000 --> 51:52.480
down causation the bottom up causation from one scale to the next scale would be you know how does

51:52.480 --> 51:57.920
my behavior my experience experience dependent plasticity my evidence accumulation all my good

51:57.920 --> 52:04.640
Bayesian decisions how does that now um mean I contribute to the gene pool at the at the

52:04.640 --> 52:10.480
evolutionary level yes so you know that that that would be one way of reading it the other way of

52:10.480 --> 52:16.960
reading it of course is just if you're designing um a tpu or deploying a tpu um you've got that

52:16.960 --> 52:22.880
you've got message passing on some graph what is a graph well it only has interesting structure

52:22.880 --> 52:28.560
in virtue of the um the sparsity or the connections that are not there otherwise it's a full graph

52:28.560 --> 52:37.040
and it's not where you saw for anybody speaking to Chris's Christopher's uh uh you know too too big

52:37.040 --> 52:43.520
too many neurons um you can't you you necessarily have to have a sparsity to fit all those neurons

52:43.520 --> 52:50.000
into um I would put it the other way around though I would say that um anything that is adaptive and

52:50.000 --> 52:57.840
has this size uh you know what properties must it possess and I would I would suggest that it has to

52:57.840 --> 53:07.760
comply with the principles of um self-evidencing um where evidence now is the marginal look the

53:07.760 --> 53:13.520
marginal likelihood that can always be read as accuracy minus complexity so as if it exists

53:13.520 --> 53:17.440
and it's big it's got to be minimally complex what does that mean it's going to have the

53:17.440 --> 53:21.600
smallest degrees of freedom uh the minimum number of connections in so you should be

53:21.600 --> 53:31.360
able to predict the sparsity from the first principles at every scale so that sparsity

53:31.360 --> 53:35.120
defines the nature of a graph and indeed if you're talking about anything that's deep

53:35.120 --> 53:40.880
in a hierarchical sense all you're saying is there's a particular kind of graph um that I

53:40.880 --> 53:46.800
have in mind and it you know has a certain sparsity structure but crucially it's a sparsity

53:46.800 --> 53:52.720
structure that allows me to call it a hierarchy it means that there are no connections that transcend

53:52.720 --> 53:58.960
unlike a sort of you know a u-shaped uh no it's still hierarchical to anyway sorry I'm

53:59.040 --> 54:04.320
getting a bit distracted right the choice of graph so I mean I think that's sort of um

54:04.320 --> 54:12.240
the notion of um coupling between different hierarchical scales is absolutely crucial

54:12.240 --> 54:18.480
from many different perspectives renormalization group evolution um you know getting the right

54:18.480 --> 54:21.680
graphical architecture and your method passing scheme and computer science so

54:22.560 --> 54:28.320
yes I wanted to bring that up but I discussed um it's actually the same thing with Levin so

54:28.320 --> 54:35.040
morphogenesis and the rungs of the emergence ladder and the causal pressures between those

54:35.040 --> 54:41.840
rungs and you know philosophers like George Ellis said that you only have causation uh between the

54:41.840 --> 54:47.360
levels and uh Douglas Hofstadter and Gaudalesha Bark and The Strange Loop thinks that there's a

54:47.360 --> 54:54.560
very complex panoply of causal pressures between the scales so like I gave the example to Michael

54:54.560 --> 55:00.160
my mind is an emergent phenomenon and I command my hand to move and he said that at different

55:00.160 --> 55:04.560
scales you get different amounts of work and actually I think if you get into integrated

55:04.560 --> 55:09.360
information theory it's kind of talking to that a little bit and and I think you think of consciousness

55:09.360 --> 55:14.240
as having a lot of um information processing going on because it's at the top of the stack to

55:14.240 --> 55:19.920
to some extent but do you have any intuition on on how that information is kind of partitioned

55:19.920 --> 55:25.920
between the scales and how those causal pressures work between the scale yes I do wonderful you're

55:25.920 --> 55:30.880
very well read aren't you so it's nice that you you mentioned George Ellis I use the word top

55:30.880 --> 55:35.120
down bottom causation exactly in the spirit that he writes about it so I had literally out here had

55:35.120 --> 55:40.240
him in mind but so I was hoping if he ever hears it he'll know that I was talking about him so it's

55:40.240 --> 55:44.800
exactly that and it always makes me a bit queasy when I use the word emergentism which I think

55:45.280 --> 55:50.400
some people say there's no top down causation in emergentism but I I don't fully understand the

55:50.400 --> 55:55.440
philosophy of it but it just acknowledged that sorry yes I've distracted myself from your really

55:55.440 --> 56:03.920
important question which oh yes the um so the the different scales um of a Bayesian mechanic

56:05.840 --> 56:12.800
self-organization viewed through the lens of Bayesian mechanics um I think um what we've just

56:12.800 --> 56:20.720
been talking about and I would imagine with with Mike as well a lot of focus of here in that kind

56:20.720 --> 56:28.320
of work um is um I hesitate to use it but I will use its spatial scales you know how how how to

56:28.320 --> 56:34.800
element how the single cells assemble into multicellular why but you know how on earth can you

56:35.680 --> 56:42.000
envisage the emergence of multicellular organisms as Mike's done some beautiful theoretical work

56:42.000 --> 56:48.080
you know several years ago now just just think about it to be a skin cell to be an epithelium

56:48.080 --> 56:51.920
means you have to sacrifice the ability to reproduce so it's if you like completely

56:51.920 --> 56:56.000
paradoxical from the point of view of natural selection you have to sacrifice yourself with

56:56.000 --> 57:03.440
the greater good so there are you know there's a wonderful questions about about um um cells of

57:03.440 --> 57:08.960
cells and of cells and cells as you build up to different levels of um spatial scale but I think

57:08.960 --> 57:14.320
your question will be better addressed from the point of view of temporal scales um and again you

57:14.320 --> 57:22.000
come back to this um universalism um now I'm getting fluent using that word um where you've

57:22.000 --> 57:27.280
got the same principle playing out yeah exactly the same principle exactly the same mechanics the

57:27.280 --> 57:35.440
same Lagrangian um playing out at different scales that um where each scale contextualizes and has

57:35.440 --> 57:42.160
this circular causality the bottom up and top down um um aspects to it in play so my favorite

57:42.160 --> 57:51.280
example of this is just to um look at a succession of belief updating um processes um from the very

57:51.280 --> 57:57.520
very fast which would be um from the point of view of um you know sentient machines it would

57:57.520 --> 58:01.920
be inference inferring states of the world as they are in the moment so state estimation

58:01.920 --> 58:08.080
Bayesian filtering um um everything that um you know speaks to some kind of situational

58:08.080 --> 58:15.760
awareness on the basis of some smart and hopefully smartly sampled data um and then we move to the

58:15.760 --> 58:21.120
next level I'm going to skip attention and precision but there is an intermediate level which

58:21.120 --> 58:27.840
usually um in in the neurosciences has has a time scale of your your hundreds to just uh

58:27.840 --> 58:32.080
of milliseconds to seconds but I'm going to I'm going to jump straight to learning

58:32.080 --> 58:38.720
so what's learning well it's just slow inference it's just basically um slow belief updating um

58:38.720 --> 58:44.640
where the states that matter now are equipped with another kind of label which we call parameters

58:44.640 --> 58:49.680
or weights in machine learning in neural network but they're just random variables that are

58:49.680 --> 58:55.760
brought to the table to explain uh or part of our world moral generative model but they're special

58:56.720 --> 59:02.800
kinds of parameters because they change very very slowly and then you move well okay

59:03.520 --> 59:07.600
so those are two levels what about turtles all the way down and turtles all the way up

59:07.600 --> 59:12.560
well okay what's the next level well the next level is now the structure so now for any given

59:12.560 --> 59:18.080
graph for example um that is equipped with edges and those edges will have to have some

59:18.880 --> 59:25.840
slowly varying parameters um that describe the you know the nature of the message passing on

59:25.840 --> 59:33.840
those edges um there will be um there will be a you know you are conditioning on upon a particular

59:33.840 --> 59:38.800
structure and you know is there a connection there is it a hierarchical is it heterarchical is it

59:38.800 --> 59:44.960
you know a unit is it um is it a transformer you know it's a convolutional you know you've seen

59:44.960 --> 59:52.560
this wonderful evolution of structures in machine learning over the past few decades as people try

59:52.560 --> 59:57.600
out different structures and you know some work for one kind of application of the work for others

59:57.600 --> 01:00:03.760
but um from the point of view of your question what we are seeing is a kind of structure learning

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:08.720
that's playing out over years so this but it's exactly the same principle it's this free energy

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:14.720
minimization but just in this instance the free energy now is a pathological it's just the average

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:22.880
over a long period of time which is the um which is the exactly the quantity that people doing

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:29.440
structure learning or Bayesian model selection use when adjudicating between different graphs usually

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:38.480
of complex system models for example um you know and you could argue that now over

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:44.960
several tens of years or hundreds of years that you know exactly the same maths could be

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:50.400
leveraged to provide a formal description of natural selection as Bayesian model selection

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.720
exactly the same thing as you're doing now when you're selecting whether to speak or whether not

01:00:54.720 --> 01:01:00.080
to speak or trying to infer you're selecting the right hypotheses about you know the narrative that

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:06.080
you have in your head that makes sense of what I'm saying um exactly the same maths and mechanics

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:12.000
is unfolding over the millennia um you know in terms of uh in terms in terms of evolution

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:19.120
so I think that's a nice example of the separation of temporal scales but the conservation of exactly

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:25.600
the same principles that have this information geometry and implicitly intelligence uh in of

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.440
a basal sort I use the word basal because that's what Mike Levin and Chris Fields and

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:36.320
Jim Place were at like using this it's this notion that um basal cognition and basal intelligence

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:44.640
transcends physics psychology and biology um it's all the same thing this is a line from

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:51.360
Chris Fields as a friend of Mike Levin yes yes and I think that's a great notion um and I think

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:57.280
you one can do that very gracefully by being a universalist and just by finding the right principle

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:05.200
the right sort of um reading of dynamics and you know that reading you know for me

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:13.280
is the information geometry that um that supports the belief updating I was going to do Markov

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:19.200
blankets later but it feels relevant now and maybe we should bring a bit of continuous versus

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:23.920
discreet in so a few things came to my mind when you were talking about that first of all we think

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:30.000
of um emergence over time and self-organization over space and I guess it just occurred to me

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.800
that are we only interested in time and space when we talk about this kind of structural learning

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:42.080
and then um with these Markov boundaries I had only thought of them um in at one point in time

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:48.240
but you could actually think of a kind of three-dimensional Markov boundary over time as well

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.960
now just to remind our audience um blanket states facilitate the interaction between

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:58.240
the internal and the external conditional independencies the external states are independent

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:04.240
from the um the internal states as long as we know the intermediate blanket states now um

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.640
to get to the uh to a core issue that we'd be modeling in complex systems you know like where

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:19.840
do you draw these boundaries and is it boundaries all the way down yes um so I think you're absolutely

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:24.240
right this is the perfect time to bring up this sort of uh I hadn't really thought about a notion

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:30.720
of boundaries in time and sort of um that's intriguing so but you're distracting me I well

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:36.720
I'll think about I'll think about that after our conversation and but no certainly so um there's

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:43.840
certainly a lot of current interest in um taking the notion of Markov blankets which is foundational

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:48.960
in this sort of reductionist lens of the free energy principle as a Bayesian mechanics um you know

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:55.120
the one could could summarize but the Bayesian mechanics of the free energy principle is simply

01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:01.520
just another kind of uh quantum mechanics or statistical mechanics that inherits just from

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:06.960
this partition that is the Markov blanket that separates the the inside from the outside yes um

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.920
now um and of course there are lots of vexed issues about one how do you identify those Markov

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:17.680
blankets and how long do they endure for um so there's lots of interest in that at the moment

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:25.200
but one very simple approach to um um the question how long do they endure for is to say well that's

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.200
not the right question because we've just talked about separation of temporal scales

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:37.040
so you have to say at what temporal scale well you operationally define the Markov blanket

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:43.680
as the time over which it exists and what would that look like then when you certainly now think

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:49.360
about um this situating that temporal scale within the context of a larger temporal scale

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:55.520
so what you now have is a a picture where big Markov blankets blankets and blankets things

01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:04.640
that define say you you and me or cultures or um um nation states or institutions that um out live

01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:13.920
say species um these big ones are last for a long time but they contextualize and provide

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:21.440
constraints on uh Markov blankets at this at a smaller scale that last for very uh for much

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:28.640
much shorter periods of time and so on all the way down so that at some level say at the molecular

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:34.240
level from your perspective these Markov blankets may only exist for nanoseconds or your

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:40.880
milliseconds um but from the perspective of the molecule thank you you know this this is a lifetime

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:47.200
and it's well happy complying with or can be understood as um you know doing its own basal

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:53.200
intelligence do its own basal leaf updating just automatically for its lifetime which may only be

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:58.480
a few hundred milliseconds um you're making sense of its world or inter being interpreted as having

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:03.840
this sort of um sort of your biotic intelligence and self-organization just because it exists for

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:11.280
that period of time so then again this interesting question you know the how does one time frame

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:17.360
contextualize the other starts to bite and you know you start to now think about um from the

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:26.880
point of view of a slower time scale what would um a succession of Markov blankets uh look like um

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:35.040
and what one uh immediately encounters is the notion of a of a wandering eye tinder and Markov

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:41.680
blanket yes um we spoke about vagueness on on the first one so we'll we'll park that but the

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:47.280
wandering sets is very very interesting but um I there were two things that I that I think I wanted

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:53.280
to understand um you do think that there's a hierarchy of blankets but I'm interested in

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:57.440
exploring this idea of whether the blankets could be observer relative because you used the word

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:02.640
understood as a Markov blanket and that brings up two things to the core of my mind first of all

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:08.400
the extent to which they are a lens versus describing something in reality I see and if they

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.640
do describe something in reality you spoke about this symmetric causal pressures which we can we

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:17.760
can speak to as well but but on this understood thing it's very similar to um Wittgenstein said

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:23.440
the meaning of a word is in its use and that meaning in language is is embedded in pragmatic

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:28.240
actions and the language game and so on and and then like the the further forward occurs well

01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:35.920
maybe the the understanding of a boundary or a you know Markov boundary blanket could be um

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:44.160
understood in the context of one's perspective right that's a great question and um and I

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:51.040
it may be informed by reading some of the philosophical literature and I should remind

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:57.200
you of course I am not a philosopher so um so what I say will be naive um you need to speak to

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:04.800
philosophers about this but I would I would say the Markov blanket um is is something which is

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:12.880
metaphysical um you know it it is defined by a particular spastic structure when formulating

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:19.920
any state space in terms of dynamics and specifically you know a long fan equation

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:25.920
so one talks about the free energy principle as a first principle account um but it does

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:31.520
actually commit to something it commits to the notion that there are states and that those

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:37.920
states have a separation of temporal scales that disambiguates or separates systemic states

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:44.160
from random fluctuations so but that's all it does there are no more assumptions and then

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:50.160
everything else follows from that under the understanding that for sufficiently large systems

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:58.720
the probability of there not being a Markov blanket is um um zero um so when this comes back

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:08.160
to the sort of um this sparse coupling conjecture um that Christopher I think was alluding to um or

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:16.000
at least we um we unpacked in terms of your if a system comes to uh exists of and it's

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.280
sufficiently big it will be sparse and once it spars there um with probability one will be

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:26.320
Markov blankets so at no point now have we introduced the notion of observers we haven't

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:31.120
at this point even introduced the notion of the free energy principle we're just saying um there

01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:36.640
will be one way of carving up large dynamical systems or certainly systems can be expressed

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:43.360
as a large van equation or a random dynamical system um um will be ways of carving them up

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:50.080
into one or more Markov blankets at one or more scales yes um and then the question is well what

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:57.760
what would it what what would one uh how would one then describe um the dynamics

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:05.040
for any given Markov blanket so you at this point you are at liberty if you are simulating

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:10.480
a universe to choose the Markov blanket and the scale that you want to simulate if you're part

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:16.000
of this system you're not at liberty because if you're part of this system you have your Markov

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.720
blanket so all you see are the sensory impressions upon your Markov blanket and you may or may not

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.880
have active states and it brings us back to the other bright lines that make between agents and

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:35.280
sense-making machines that can't act sessile things um so if you're asking um I am I um

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:42.400
are the observer dependent perspective dependent aspects of um this formulation

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:52.480
using Markov blankets as a um a physiological device not if you're part of the system it says

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:57.120
something quite profound about what you could you know what you know what and if you're being

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:03.040
observed by something else if you believe if your world model is populated with the fantasy that

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:11.120
there are other observers out there yes um then um those observers will never ever know your internal

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:18.400
states well what about rather than an observer um an actor or an agent and we'll talk about

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:22.560
an activism in a little bit but even at the microscopic scale there are still affordances

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:28.480
and you gave this beautiful example of um of a type of species where someone might kill themselves

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:32.400
with a great good and that that shows the kind of information sharing that you have in in these

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:39.120
complex systems so similarly if I'm an agent in this system and and I act and and there are these

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:43.120
you've described this cybernetic loop and there are these kind of symmetrical causal pressures and

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:48.880
so on and and and then you almost get this emergence of the Markov blanket so it's so it's

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:56.320
changeable yes no it certainly um that's only true um it is changeable and it's malleable and

01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.400
it's self-assembling uh and certainly when you have Markov blankets and Markov blankets and

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.320
coalitions of Markov blankets for example of formation of in-groups and out-groups and the

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:11.280
like yes you would expect there to be a a you know a dynamics of of the Markov blankets or

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:17.040
who you're relating to so you know the sparsity uh structure and who I talk to and who I listen to

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:24.640
and you know what social media uh you know I commit to all of these things are um products of or

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:30.960
reflections and can all be articulated in terms of you know wandering Markov blankets that's

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:40.000
absolutely true um I I thought you were you were asking um something more about um whether the

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:47.360
Markov blanket is part of a realist metaphysical description or whether it's uh you know I mean

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:54.080
there is another argument if you if you now play god and you now put your universe in in a computer

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:59.040
and now to simulate and write papers about your simulated universe where you can see

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:04.080
the the internal states next to all states then you know I think you're in a different world um

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:11.200
just I get I repeat that's something quite profound about the questions of you know what

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:18.080
is it like to be something um are interesting because from the point of view of the free energy

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:22.800
principle what is it like to be something means that someone's asking that question so they are a

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:28.880
thing and they're asking about another thing so now they're asking questions what is it what are

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:36.720
is it like to um know the internal states of a Markov blanket but by definition you can never

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:42.320
know them so there is something impenetrable about being something else so it's a question

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:50.800
which is unanswerable it's unknowable um um so if um from that point of view I think there's something

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:58.560
beyond the um the sort of the epistemology of you know um of Markov blankets but if you're just

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:03.920
simulating cells or people or you know doing multi-agent simulations then obviously you can

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:10.480
you can choose where to put your blankets and you can you can just use them as a device to um

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:16.160
to understand self-organization to simulate it and to predict it and I think in that instance

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:22.400
you know that you you could deploy your Markov blankets wherever you wanted to at every any

01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:28.000
scale you you you thought was interesting for the phenomena of interest that's not quite speaking

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.400
to what you're into though which is a changeability of the the Markov blankets or well I mean we

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:37.280
can get into that um because if uh and later on we'll talk about the the real world implementations

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:44.080
of these ideas but um but if you if you did hard code the the Markov blankets then you

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:48.400
would bottleneck the system essentially so ideally you you would actually have the system

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:54.320
to find a sufficient resolution where all of this could could emerge um itself yeah did did you cover

01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:02.160
the point of whether the blankets can be um must they be spatially temporally you know should they

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:08.400
have a spatial temporal contiguity and the reason I'm asking that question is when you think of a

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:14.240
blanket I like almost synonymizing it with an organism and maybe that's a bad thing to do and

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:20.400
you can correct me but but if we think of um the discontinuous blankets in information geometry

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:26.400
that's an interesting idea because we kind of visualize them in 3d space don't you yeah yeah

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:32.000
yeah well certainly they'll have a topology yeah um I mean I've noticed earlier on you're talking

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.160
about sort of play cells and grid cells which are you know very special and beautiful constructs

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:42.640
which speak to a certain continuity or contiguity aspect yes they they suggest that these um you're

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:50.880
coming back to uh Christopher some of um Summerfield's um book um you know one way of understanding

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:56.480
the um the Markov blankets in the brain so you know we've been talking about Markov blankets

01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:02.160
delineating me from a world but of course um your temporal lobe has a Markov blanket as it

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:06.640
wouldn't be a thing you wouldn't be able to call it a temporal lobe so you know the very hierarchy

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:13.120
could also be described now in terms of um Markov blankets within Markov blankets within Markov

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:16.880
blankets and some really interesting questions about what that means for what what part of the

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:21.120
brain can know about another part of the brain and what and what action becomes of course it becomes

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:25.520
a tension yeah I just wanted to slip that in because I think that was in part what you were

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:32.800
driving at with this sort of context sensitive fluid dynamics on in exchanges between Markov

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:38.320
blankets I think it's incredibly important even within the brain in neuroscience this is basically

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:43.440
the the routing of information the deployment of selective attention or sensory attenuation

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:49.360
attenuating ignoring some signals it is exactly that that makes us such adaptive context sensitive

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:54.720
information processing um machines and of course that is exactly what you'd have to worry about

01:16:54.720 --> 01:17:01.280
when designing a web with routing and and context sensitive you know who do I listen to uh so you

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:11.920
you know this is really really important um the um so the the the emergence of um I think

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:19.600
you're absolutely right they will have a topology and if I were using Markov blankets and you know

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:26.400
I do and many other people do every day when um thinking about message passing as a statistician

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:34.800
on factor graphs or um which are due to a graphical model a probabilistic graphical model of the

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:42.880
system you're trying to estimate or understand um then you know the Markov blanket is just the um

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:47.920
you know the implicit notes that that are the influence of me or the or the parents of children

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.240
the parents of the children you know and that has enormous implications for minimizing the

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:57.920
complexity of the message passing um and you know and I repeat defines a hierarchy for example

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:07.200
so Markov blankets there will have a topology um probably best understood practically from the

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:15.760
point of view of graph theory as opposed to um information geometry um but there are special

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:24.160
kinds of connectivity that you see um such as place fields and I'd also say if you just look

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:30.640
at the history of machine learning there are particular um kinds of Markov blankets that

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:34.560
characterize the very structure of certain neural networks I'm thinking here convolutional neural

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:39.840
networks I'm thinking about you're often motivated through weight sharing and the like but you know

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:43.520
if you look at weight sharing as just the kind of structural learning that's trying to minimize the

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:53.120
complexity part of your free energy or your um negative um log marginal likelihood um then what

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:57.600
you are doing is finding the right kind of spastic fit for explaining these kinds of data

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:03.840
what uh what what what is the architectural principle it's it's the translational invariance

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:09.600
the translational symmetry it's just the contiguity aspect it's a fact that you are sampling data

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:16.080
that is generated in or from a metric space that has a well-behaved metric so I would I would say

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:21.040
that sort of you know place cells and grid cells and many in and many other are thinking about

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:27.520
Chris's friend Tim Behren's work for example um finding grid light structures everywhere

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:34.000
in abstract spaces uh so what that tells you is that that it's likely that we live in a world

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:44.880
um where data are caused by samples from a metric space that has a you know a measure to it um not

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:50.880
all spaces do um I think it'd be you'd be hard pushed to find you know the right kind of metric

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:56.160
for language for example um and certainly if you're if you're if you're sort of building

01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:01.200
message-passing schemes or believe propagation schemes on a factor graph you don't you don't

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:06.640
think about contiguity in a metric sense you know you don't measure the distance between one node

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:12.400
another node it's is it connected or not um so I think there are some special um contiguity

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:19.840
there are some special worlds that are recapitulated that emerge in the internal architectures of

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:26.880
intelligent machines that have this contiguity property in virtue of the fact that some aspects

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:34.240
of the causes of the sensorium are elaborated in a metric space but not necessarily everywhere

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:40.560
and yeah well I want to take you back I know you for you I want to where you want to take me

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:49.120
anyway well I will I will finish then because um I see uh in the brain and I also see in the

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:56.560
direction of travel in terms of um building thinking machines um as you get deeper into

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:05.120
these hierarchies and you go from a fine scale to larger scale there is an interesting move between

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:12.960
um um architectures that would speak to this metric aspect in space and in time

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:20.880
to a more discretized topological non-metric representation yes I know I wanted to touch

01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:25.200
on that I mean there's a beautiful example I mean Christopher Summerfield talks about

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:31.440
Pierce's triad and various ways that we learn different types of um symbol and abstractions

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:35.440
and so on and there is a famous experiment in neuroscience I'm sure you're familiar with it

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:41.360
where they showed people pictures in a certain order and associations and then the same topological

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:47.360
structure was was recovered I think in the NTL and and this is because even though with spatial

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:51.840
temporal contiguity there is a metric space but the brain learns these kind of associations and

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:56.400
then you can essentially learn these abstract concepts that you know concepts that reverberate

01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:01.920
in our language and experience they get represented yes and I completely agree with your um point

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:08.160
about the the revolutionary idea of the um the translational local um equivalence you know the

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:15.120
the way it's sharing with CNNs it's a beautiful idea it's revolutionized deep learning so um

01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.280
just to finish off the discussion on Markov blankets I wanted to talk about part-hole

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:26.240
relationships so um for the benefit of the audience in logic and philosophy myriology

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:33.040
is the study of parts and holes that they form whereas in set theory it's founded on the membership

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:40.720
relation between a set and its elements and myriology emphasizes the relation between entities

01:22:40.720 --> 01:22:45.440
which is to say the inclusion between them so anyway when considering systems Markov blankets

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:51.440
can nest into hierarchies and what connection if any is there you know between that in the

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:57.200
philosophical study of myriology and um I was also going to bring in I don't know if you've

01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:03.760
heard of Hinton's glom architecture but it it it was it came after capsule networks and it's

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:08.000
you know we were just talking about these wonderful inductive priors in deep learning and they

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:13.280
they make the problem there are many curses in machine learning but one of them is kind of like

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:19.360
the curse of optimization and um and there's a complexity curse as well and that's why most

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:24.880
of these inductive priors they reduce the size of the hypothesis set if you reduce it too much

01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:28.560
you get approximation error which doesn't help you either there's curses everywhere but um

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:31.760
but this is a really interesting prior as well these part whole relationship

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:38.880
gosh yes there's so many issues you bring that I'll just reiterate my favorite one which is the

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:45.040
you know the the notion of um these inductive biases minimizing the complexity I think that's

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:49.600
absolute you know that's something which is absolutely central um from the physicist's

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:58.400
perspective you know this um reading um self organization as self evidencing which is a

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:05.600
philosophically poetic way of simply um describing existence as an optimization process which you

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:11.040
shouldn't really do it's all it's really a principle of least action but you can read it as an optimization

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:17.840
process what are you optimizing the evidence for my world models what how can I carve up that evidence

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:23.520
complexity and accuracy what does having a what would I then mean by optimization what I mean

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:30.480
just providing the simplest account that maintains a degree of accuracy what do I mean by simplest

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:37.600
minimizing the degrees of freedom that I use up in providing that accurate account how do I do that

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:42.320
by the right spastic structure what does that mean it just means finding the right structure

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:48.080
and you know you could actually think of much of evolution and um the trajectory of machine

01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:53.920
learning architectures as this game of finding the right structure but there are just these structural

01:24:53.920 --> 01:25:00.640
priors that are apt for describing the kind of data you know so if you're you've spent your

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:06.240
entire life doing emnist images then it's going to be the kind of structural priors that they are

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:10.800
that's that inherit from being sampled from a metric space and you'll have all the convolution

01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:16.960
I think the capsule I didn't I didn't know about the glom stuff I was like listening to Jeff's

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:23.600
latest ideas because he's always got the right kind of intuitions and and these intuitions are

01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:31.840
part of the I think part of our reflection of ashby's law of requisite varieties explored in

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:40.480
hypothesis space about the very structures but certainly the the capsule stuff and the you know

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:48.080
the one aspect of structures of graphical models or implicit factor graphs when it comes to

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:55.520
implementation which I think is often neglected is the orthogonal direction from the orthogonal

01:25:55.520 --> 01:26:01.680
aspect you know in relation to hierarchical composition and that's the sort of the breadth

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:08.000
of a model in terms of having factors that can be separated so if you wanted to have

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:14.640
say scene construction you wanted to have multi-object you're the ability to track and infer

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:21.360
and and make sense of data generated by multiple objects what are you saying well there are multiple

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:27.680
things out there and these things again from the point of view of first principle account

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:33.280
have certain conditional independences that is literally revealed by a lack of connections

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.680
in your world model what would that look like well if you're a physicist it would just be a

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:43.920
mean field approximation literally factorizing introducing conditional independences and factorizing

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:49.920
a massive joint distribution at any one level in your hierarchical model into a number of factors

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:55.600
that if you're a neurobiologist would now be functional specialization and modularity of a

01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:03.120
fedorian sense you know what aware in the brain would be the the the conical examples so I looked

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:10.880
at that as as a move towards paying more careful attention to the non convolutional aspect you

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:18.720
know those things that that actually deny a translational symmetry and actually celebrate

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:22.960
the conditional independences within any one particular within any one particular scale

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:28.720
so my guess is and I have no idea so I'm talking from a point of view of complete ignorance but

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:34.800
my guess is that if it's an extension of capsule networks then it will have that aspect it'll have

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:42.240
that separability that sort of things that can do stuff and account for attributes that are independent

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:49.600
from other attributes or other objects that are that are conspiring to generate the data and certainly

01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:58.400
my world of toy prototypes generative models usually in matlab you know then all the heavy

01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:03.840
lifting is done from the the mapping between the levels again so all the interactions you know

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:09.120
big red buses there's bigness as redness as busness these can be factorized but they all

01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:16.080
have to conspire literally through interactions and highly non-linear operators

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:25.360
and then generating what I would see if there was a big red bus so you know that puts a lot of pressure

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:32.320
on the the likelihood tensors or the mapping from you know you'll say a sense an input layer to the

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:37.920
the first hidden layer for example and then sort of leads you into all sorts of interesting issues

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:44.320
about you know how do you accommodate that non linearity and do you again as looking at the

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:51.760
evolution of machine learning architectures as an evolutionary process you know at relu or you know

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:57.840
tannate whatever you know that is another aspect of this sort of structural learning I think we'll

01:28:57.840 --> 01:29:03.600
be very much finessed I think if we just move to sort of quantum operators and just go to discrete

01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:08.560
state spaces in the in the spirit of quantum loop gravity I think sort that out and then we can worry

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:13.760
about what particularly non linearities I've wondered away what was it what was your question my

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:19.200
point well no this this is a wonderful breakpoint so um before we hit record we were talking a little

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:23.680
bit about chat gbt and just before we go there because that's a fun discussion I think one of the

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:27.680
things that really distinguishes your your line of thinking me obviously there's the uncertainty

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:32.480
quantification someone but um also there's this idea of an activism and I wanted to just do a

01:29:32.480 --> 01:29:38.400
whistle stop tour of that as a contrast to these more monolithic approaches to AI like like chat

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:45.520
gbt so um an activism contrasts with representationalism which is this idea that I you know I know

01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:51.760
everything about the world inside the model and um you said that you can't just think of the brain

01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:58.080
as some behaviorist thing it's a dance of dialogue you act in the environment and the environment acts

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:03.120
on you in a cybernetic loop now you also gave the I'm quoting like an interview that you did

01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:09.840
previously you gave the example of radical an activism that you can dispense of representationalism

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:16.000
entirely and you gave this beautiful example of this walking robot that kind of fell down a hill

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:23.040
and it did so so gracefully it looked like it was walking it was all in the body um you know if the

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:27.920
body is sufficiently tuned to the environment you don't even need cognition and of course we'll

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:33.600
talk about the decomposition of cognition in a minute um and and you bring in this idea of

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:40.320
circular causality uh so we're causally embedded in the world by directionally essentially now

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:47.120
when we decompose cognition um I think of things like thinking and feeling and knowing and acting

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:51.600
and and the environment and and so on and I think this is one of the key things that distinguishes

01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:55.840
your your line of thought so could you give us a bit of a whistle stop tour of an activism

01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:05.840
yeah so um an activism is at the heart of the circuit causality that that that um follows from

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:11.920
the very existence of a Markov blanket um and a Markov blanket is the thing that would be it's

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:17.280
certainly in my world necessary for the existence of something that is demarcated or individuated

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:24.480
from something else so just having a separation between thing and nothing or not thing um

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:32.080
having uh that separation requires you now to think about the two-way traffic um the bi-directional

01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:39.040
traffic and of course now you've got two directions of travel that can be thought of as um the agent

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:46.240
if you like sensing the environment um on the one hand and on the other hand the agent acting

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:52.400
upon the environment or vice versa um you've got now a circular causality so coming back to sort of

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:58.960
your the the the the notion of a perception action cycle and this notion of a dancing and a

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:05.680
a derdic exchange which is bi-directional two-way traffic between the two so when you apply the

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:12.240
free energy principle in practice to um emulate or simulate sentient behavior behavior that is

01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:19.120
predicated on sense making um then you are necessarily simulating action perception cycles

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:24.320
so you're necessarily inactivist and that's called active inference so sometimes just for fun i put

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:29.600
an en in front of it called an active inference i have to say the active inference was really a

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:38.240
nod to active learning it was just it's same idea but um but cast in terms of fast belief updating

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:45.840
as opposed to sort of slow evidence accumulation in terms of learning contingencies um so that use

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:51.680
of inactive is at the heart of applications of the free energy principle and obviously

01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:57.120
has been at the heart of i think all right-minded formulations of behavior and self-organization

01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:03.280
since Plato probably but certainly you know things like perceptual control theories cybernetics and

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:11.280
all of that good stuff everybody at some point active sensing um well you know what will will

01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:18.560
have to commit to this um active aspect um even to a certain extent semiotics i think well

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:26.160
no perhaps we shouldn't gather um but the so that would be one way of um sort of celebrating and

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:34.320
foregrounding the role of action um and what would that look like from the point of view of

01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:40.400
machine learning and computer science well it would look like basically smart data mining

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:49.520
and it would change the nature of the game from um big data making sense of big data so having

01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:56.400
everything on the inside having access to the entire world um and then making sense of that and

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:59.680
you know you may ask what does that mean by making sense of it well it's certainly doing

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:08.400
something with it like generative AI versus um the the the complementary approach which is much

01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:13.360
more in line with this sort of complexity minimization the imperatives for the sustainable

01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:21.040
self-organizing self-assembling systems versus smart data um so the job the action now is

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:27.120
this basically what moves do i make on the world to get the right kind of data that will serve my

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:31.600
imperatives what are my imperatives to maximize the evidence from my model of the world and if

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:38.960
i can do that by definition my um i will be there or put it other way around if i you know if i exist

01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:44.720
then that is what it looks like i am doing so you know you talk about the or you mentioned this notion

01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:52.720
sort of monolithic big systems um versus small agile intelligent little agents that go and get

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:59.920
the smart data that they need or that they think that you need that is exactly um the sort of picture

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:06.720
that underwrites this notion of distributed cognition and that a different kind of network

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:14.080
and a different way of relating to intelligent artifacts and information services and um and

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:21.120
apps uh where it's lots of really small smart things who are actively getting the right kind

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:27.600
of data that they need to um resolve uncertainty about the context in which they find themselves

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:32.000
again that you know the complexity minimization gets in and the things are very i'm sure we've

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.600
talked about this before but i can't resist just um mentioning it again from the point of view of

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:43.520
sustainability and climate change you know the direction of travel of these large um say large

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:49.680
language models for example is it's so wrong uh wrong from the point of view of the ideology of

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:54.240
climate change but also wrong from the point of view of landowners principle and the jeniski

01:35:54.240 --> 01:36:02.320
equality when read as a thermodynamic corollary of self-organization and non-equilibrium you know

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:10.080
you've got to minimize the complexity minimize um all of the internal machinations so that you

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:16.400
you just need the minimal amount of data um expertly handled every little agents and good

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:21.440
scientists designing the right experiments and get the smart data that resolves uncertainty about

01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:27.840
what it doesn't know uh the job done if you if you can do it like that so that would be one um if

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:34.560
you like sort of answer to your question your um the implications and the importance of inactivism

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:41.600
used really just as a euphemism for an agent that can gather its own data the radical inactivism is

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:46.000
i think a more of a philosophical thing and it's more of a fun argument and i don't know any radical

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:52.800
inactivist so i you know i i don't i don't have um i don't have the right sensibilities uh to

01:36:52.800 --> 01:37:00.240
just really answer this question but it's for what i understand um they you know they they have um

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:08.720
taken it a little bit too far and uh denying representationalism um uh to the extent that

01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:17.600
you know the you can get a kind of um sense making that doesn't actually involve any internal

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:25.360
dynamics um and um you know i'm sure that's true and i'm sure that you're going to sell um uh chat

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:34.400
cheat uh gtp to me as well as one one example of this mindless kind of uh sort of you're inacted

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:41.760
um sense making um it's the opposite i think um i would call chat gbt extreme representationalism

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:48.080
all right yes we'll resist the urge that we'll go there immediately after this i i promise but

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:55.520
um so clearly we we think that intelligence does necessitate embodiment i think that's clear but

01:37:55.520 --> 01:38:02.080
i want to just explore this continuum between um inactivism and representationalism um

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:10.880
um this is this is really interesting so um this comes down to grounding to a certain extent so

01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:17.840
cognition must be grounded in different domains in in the physical world possibly in language in

01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:24.560
acting in affordances in knowledge as well and so this this is a view that that it that it is

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:33.120
grounded let's say in in affordances but if these agents these organisms ground their cognition

01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:39.920
in affordances then to what extent could you say they are learning a world model if that model is

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:50.480
with the lens of an affordance i think i think you can sort of do this um reconcile um very rich

01:38:50.480 --> 01:39:00.240
representationalism um in the service of inactivism simply by noting that um in the circular exchange

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:05.520
you have to deploy the right kinds of actions and that's going to require um coming back to

01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:08.960
what we're talking about before in terms of planning yeah being able to build the right

01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:16.320
counterfactuals no and to do to do that in an expert way in an intelligent way you need to

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:21.440
be able to represent the causal contingencies and states affairs in the world at this time

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:27.200
upon which you're predicating your next action so i i'm now just thinking you know

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:33.600
just looking at your your expressions and i now realize that you that you were trying to sell

01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:39.520
a dialectic between uh inactivism and representationalism for me um they are the same thing

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:44.240
you to be a good inactivist you have to have the right representations if you want to

01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:51.040
to well may i say good i mean um good at a particular scale the big things that survive

01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:56.560
so viruses don't need to do much planning um but things like you and me do need to do a lot

01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:01.200
quite a lot of planning so as you move up those scales you have to look further into the future

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:07.600
so that we certainly need representations which is what i have which um which is why i'll smile

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:13.520
always smile what i think about radical inactivism um so if there's no space in radical inactivism

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:20.720
for being able to plan to imagine scenarios to have narratives that play out on the inside before

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:26.160
committing and selecting the right way forward yeah and it's not an apt description of certainly

01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:35.120
cognition okay it's so interesting because the question to me is we just spoke about this idea

01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:41.680
of planning potentially through an information geometry and many of the abstractions that humans

01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:48.560
learn are not grounded in the physical world at all and that's very interesting and we can get to

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:54.720
how those abstractions are learned but i guess what i'm saying is let's say one of these agents in

01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:02.240
this multi-agent system it's traversing this topology what grounds the states in that topology

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:10.080
well i think that that would be um ultimately it will be the transactions um you know with

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:15.920
with the world the underwrite um at the lowest hierarchal level all the generative models of

01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:22.160
this hierarchal sorts of the abstractions are just the coarse-graining simplifications that you know

01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:29.440
the the um the products of literally looking at the lower levels of your hierarchy through a

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:35.120
reductionist lens in the right kind of way that enable you to carve up the world in terms of these

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:42.400
in terms of these abstractions which may live in a non-metric space they may still have this

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:48.160
ordinal structure you were referring to before and then what that would mean in the context of

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:55.040
lots of similar artifacts who had done the right kind of coarse-graining would be now

01:41:55.040 --> 01:42:02.160
the opportunity for direct belief sharing your brain-to-brain communication speaking to a friend

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:08.240
of mine you heard yesterday talking about the distinction between communicating through um

01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:18.000
the through sensory um um exchanges such as language but what we're actually doing is basically

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:24.240
directly exchanging beliefs um of course you could do that directly um in silico you could

01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:31.360
actually have messages about what this agent believes at this abstract level of um of representation

01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:37.040
very high in a you know hierarchal graphical model it could pass its sufficient statistics to

01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:43.520
another partner somewhere else in the world um elsewhere on that on that graph so you do have

01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:49.920
the opportunity now for direct belief sharing um and um there are all sorts of interesting questions

01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:55.200
about you know how you'd engineer that you know you can't coming back to this fact you have to

01:42:55.200 --> 01:43:00.320
have sparsely in the game you have to decide where to to send and receive your beliefs from

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:04.640
then we have this sort of attention and routing problem and then you have do you have peer-to-peer

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:10.080
communication do you go through a server can you write that down in terms of um quantum

01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:15.200
information theories a holographic screen and who's you know having all sorts of really interesting

01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:21.120
things but what they speak to is that you're now you're sharing beliefs literally basing beliefs

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:27.680
probability distributions as encoded by sufficient statistics that can be passed um as messages uh

01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:35.760
on a on a factor graph um you're now talking about the ability for proper communication

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:42.640
of the kind that has evolved in terms of cultural niche construction and evolutionary psychology

01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:48.880
that speaks to cultural niche construction uh that we enjoy in terms of you know the words

01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:56.000
that we use and the and the exchanges that we use yes yes indeed there are two things to bring in

01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:02.480
so knowledge and language and you did invoke Andy Clark in another interview which is the

01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:09.680
extended theory of mind so it's one of the five ease in cognitive science and the the communication

01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:15.360
substrate could of course it's it's distributed so the two agents could be referring on missing

01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:20.560
information that actually exists perhaps in another agent or another another knowledge repository

01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:25.680
and then we can also talk to exactly what the role of language is and how it's compressed how it

01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:30.800
represents abstract concepts and so on um so i'm very interested in knowledge and language i'm not

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:36.480
sure if you could bring those in right um i'm not sure i can do so expertly but certainly

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:43.520
part of learning new things since my foray into into industry is this notion of knowledge graphs so

01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:52.480
if you know if you read a probabilistic graphical model as um at least its structure as being a

01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:58.400
knowledge graph then embodied um in the structure and presumably the parameters of the connections

01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:05.200
that constitute that graphical model that would be knowledge so for me um in a very non-mysterious

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:12.960
and possibly too simple minded a way knowledge is just the product of um belief updating of a

01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:22.000
slow kind which is learning so i know contingencies um in the sense that i have um a suitably configured

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:29.600
optimized structure and parametrically weighted um generative model that can be written down as a

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:35.280
knowledge graph or a graphical model um upon which i do my message passing to do my inference about

01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:42.240
the particular context sensitive in the moment kind of thing so i would put knowledge um basically

01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:52.240
as an attribute uh that is implicit in a um a graphical description of um uh an implicit

01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:59.280
generative model or world model that is um actively um that is used actively to do the

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:05.680
data mining to do the you know do the inference and uh and the sense making and then the language

01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:15.520
part of it um would just be that um highest level most coarse grained summary that is conserved over

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:26.320
multiple agents so just by definition um if i want to do belief sharing um i have to um i have to

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:32.800
have a a shared generative model or a commitment to the same narrative so that the meaning of

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:38.800
what i'm emitting is received in the right spirit or the right frame of reference by you

01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:44.640
and indeed um there's some lovely rhetoric from quantum information theory of the kind

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:49.120
that Chris Fields and Jim Glacebrook have been pursuing where you literally have to

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:56.400
think about the generative model as a quantum frame of reference and we have to share that in

01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:03.360
order to communicate so in this instance the um the Markov blanket ceases to be just a set of states

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:11.040
and see and and adopts the role of a holographic screen and action now is writing to that screen

01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:17.520
and sensation is now reading from that screen and there are two agents on either side so you know

01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:22.160
whatever is written is an action but can be read by something else and then you're looking at the

01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:28.080
entanglement which is the the synchrony of mutual understanding that you know we would aspire to

01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:37.120
through through through communication so that that that um but that only works if if the messages

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:43.840
that are written to the screen or written to the Markov blanket um um have the same kind of

01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:50.000
interpretation so it speaks again to this um the the fact that you have to have a good model of the

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:59.280
world and the world has um and that really means that there's a kind of entanglement or

01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:03.360
generalized synchrony from the point of view of dynamical system theory between the two sides of

01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:12.480
your screen or the two sides of your Markov blanket or your server um um which have you know the right

01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:18.560
kind of isomorphism so we're talking about you know basically a shared narrative that underwrites

01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:24.080
any exchange of signals and again what you know just thinking of of this from the point of view

01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:32.480
of generalized synchrony what we are talking about is just the characteristic

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:39.680
or the emergence of characteristic behaviors in any sparsely coupled set or ensemble of

01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:47.760
things that possess Markov blankets or have a separability um um uh what will they ultimately

01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:54.160
do they'll ultimately find a synchronization manifold they'll find uh a synchronization

01:48:54.800 --> 01:49:01.520
simply because um this is the um the most likely state of being and the most likely

01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:04.960
state of being is that which maximizes the marginal likelihood which minimizes the free

01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:10.160
energy which just means that they now understand and can infer each other so you know it's just

01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:16.640
another expression of this existential imperative to resolve uncertainty have good models of my world

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:21.040
and my world also needs to have good models of me and if my world is you you have to have

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:25.040
a good model of me and I have to have a good model of you ultimately what that means is

01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:30.160
we're going to converge on the same model um yeah I mean what interests me there is that

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:36.560
unlike many other researchers you're conflating understanding you know knowing and intelligence

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:44.560
itself I guess I guess so yeah um so good question um if intelligence is a process of belief

01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:52.240
updating then yes it's just intelligence and learning and just learning knowledge and intelligently

01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:56.000
inferring states of affairs are just the same process at different time scales and they both

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:02.320
depend upon each other so I have to have the right neural network of the right weights and the right

01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:08.800
learning to make sense of the data in the moment and if you think of it from the point of view of

01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:15.440
weight learning um either through propagation of errors or through experience dependent or

01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:19.920
spike timing plasticity in the brain you have to have the right inference in order to do the

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:24.880
learning so there's again this circular causality between between the two scales so knowledge

01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:29.920
requires the right inference or state estimation and state estimation requires the right knowledge

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:35.280
to make sense of the data that's being assimilated yes although I suppose philosophically we could

01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:39.600
break it down because you know knowledge might be the sort of the information acquisition

01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:44.400
because knowledge exists it's quite an interesting philosophical point actually that

01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:50.960
knowledge is on Wikipedia and it's crystallized knowledge it exists as a thing but the ability

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:57.360
to to acquire knowledge without surprise is is is your your form of intelligence but I wanted to

01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:04.240
talk about chat gpt just quickly and it's very interesting because Bing have just released

01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:12.240
a new version of their search engine which integrates chat gpt and I've I've been on a bit of a journey

01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:19.680
when they released gpt 3 in the it was November 2020 I got access to it I thought it was garbage

01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:24.720
it was just generating a load of rubbish basically but there were people out there who were true

01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:30.320
believers and they said Tim you're not seeing it I you know I I've seen it and they would show me

01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:36.160
these ridiculous examples and I just thought no you're just fooled by randomness and and then

01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:42.240
DaVinci 2 came out about a year ago and then that that transgressed the anthropomorphic

01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:47.200
fooled by randomness threshold so I started to be a bit of a believer I knew it didn't understand

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:52.000
anything but it started to get very useful and I was using it for coding and generating emails and so

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:58.400
on much much to my loss actually because recently I've been checking code into the to the repo and

01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:03.200
my colleagues have been saying to me Tim it looks like you used gpt to generate that why is it full

01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:08.560
of holes and you have to hold your hand up and oh yes I'm sorry I just I just checked in some code

01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:14.960
that I clearly didn't understand and you know didn't actually save me any time so sometimes you can

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:21.760
see problems with its generation but it's so plausible that most of the time they're hidden

01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:26.000
and unfortunately if you want to verify that knowledge you might as well have just not bothered

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:31.360
using gpt in the first place because you could have just gone so a little recap it's using a

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:36.480
self-attention decoder transformer and that's a neural network architecture that introduces

01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:42.960
permutation invariance to tuple permutation invariance which turns out to be extremely

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:48.960
useful for language and then there was this discovery of what's called in context learning

01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:54.080
which is where rather than just getting it to because it's a generative model it just generates

01:52:54.080 --> 01:53:01.120
token token you you insert a prompt and then continue to generate from that prompt and people

01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:07.520
discovered you could ask it questions it had this emergent reasoning capability in big air quotes

01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:11.840
and then more recently people have done what's called preference fine tuning which is that you

01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:18.800
do some additional supervision on the top with human reference examples and that aligns it to

01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:25.440
humans and makes it give slightly more politically correct or you know more sensible answers so

01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:30.400
and now it's been integrated into gpt and that does this retrieval augmented generation which

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:36.240
means rather than just being a snapshot in time it will also go out go out to bing get some relevant

01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:41.440
search results incorporate that into the prompt and then generate from there and there was this

01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:45.440
incident a couple of days ago where Bing had this successful launch to much fanfare

01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:50.640
and then people looked at the results it was generating including fine you know one of the

01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:56.080
the things was give me a comparison between the financial results of lulu lemon and some other

01:53:56.080 --> 01:54:01.920
company and it was just hallucinating the results it gave weren't even in the document

01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:08.720
and the product managers at microsoft didn't even themselves bother to check the truthfulness of

01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:13.280
this generation so god help anyone else using Bing um so what's your take cut

01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:21.360
i love that story thank you um as we were talking about before i i've heard so much about chuck

01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:26.160
gtp but i haven't been able to get on it because because it's always always been used over some

01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:33.200
subscriber it's a it's a wonderful moment isn't it and so many issues there um i don't know where

01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:44.880
to start with um perhaps i should start um by um conversations i've heard um about why the

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:54.000
chuck gtp moment is so important um always reduce really to um the fact that people got

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:59.440
in you're enchanted and had access to it so it wasn't so much other but it's actually really

01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:02.640
interesting to hear about the technological and the structure of the genetic model makes it work

01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:09.120
i didn't know that that was that was very useful but whatever you know the those are not really

01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:14.560
sort of quantum leaps they're not massive technological you know innovations um but what

01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:19.440
the innovation was of the accessibility so i think you know just standing back why that was a

01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:24.080
moment and it has been a moment i think you know in terms of selling ai to investors and the like

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:29.120
they are they all now oh you're talking about chuck gtp like stuff i know about that that's

01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:37.120
really exciting uh so it has changed the landscape i think uh there has been a moment um but why did

01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:42.880
it happen i think it's basically all this belief sharing i think it's you know basically uh the

01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:51.040
participatory aspect it is exactly um this um if you like sort of emphasis on belief sharing among

01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:57.440
lots of smart agents including ourselves which is you know which if you can realize that potential

01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:06.400
and getting people engaged uh is the is the nice way to use uh artificial intelligence um and in

01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:12.560
that respect you you ask yourself well how is it being used um and it's being used as gerative ai

01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:18.960
and of course you've asked yourself well okay what what's gerative ai got brought to the table

01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:25.920
well it's generating the kind of stuff that i would see um and you're basically it's an

01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:31.280
interpolation machine you know sort of if i give it enough stuff it'll interpolate and generate the

01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:37.920
kind of things that i've given it um so why is that useful well you can now select from the stuff it

01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:46.000
generates uh and you know but all of this game is all quintessentially dyadic interaction or

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.680
you participating with the generative ai that's why it's so attractive it's not the marvelous

01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:57.440
stuff it generates it just interpolates stuff um you know the interesting bit is when you now

01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:02.000
have the opportunity to select oh i like that one i don't like that one i'm going to check that code

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:08.000
before or i'm not going to check that code before before putting it in um so i looked at from that

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:16.960
point of view i think that both those if you like the um why it became so much foregrounded in people's

01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:24.000
conversation and in the media uh and why more generally people are have been enchanted by

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.800
generative ai i think they both speak to the fact that you're actually engaging people

01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:36.240
it's a dyadic exchange um of an asymmetric sort and that asymmetry um is exemplified by

01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:42.240
generative ai that there's all the action all the choosing all the triaging all the selection

01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:47.200
and what to actually show your friends or send off in your email is done by you the human user

01:57:47.200 --> 01:57:52.960
so all the inactive bit is actually done by the human still you know the generative ai in and of

01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:58.320
itself is not actually acting because it's generating content the other interesting thing about

01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:04.560
generative ai is that it's generating content not beliefs so unlike google maps which actually

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:10.240
gives you a belief about the you know the best plan forward um it's actually generating content

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:16.160
it's in data space so from the point of view of a statistician or from the point of view of

01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:22.800
a physicist committed to a um a holographic screen or markov blanket formulation of exchange with

01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:28.800
the world um notice that generative ai is doesn't have doesn't need to understand because that's

01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:35.600
not its purpose its purpose is to generate sensations to generate data to generate stuff

01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:41.360
in content space or data space stuff that has been mined in the space that the mining took place

01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:47.760
not in the sense making and the the abstraction and the understanding space so you know i i think

01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:52.240
that's an interesting distinction which which um that you know i'm sort of going off an attendant

01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:57.920
here but it's interesting when it comes to what do you mean by belief shurning and communication

01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:05.440
but just look at that um that observation in light of the discussion about why

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:14.240
gtp is so successful it's successful because it generates language so the content now is

01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:21.600
the belief and it's the kind of belief structures that have been honed through probably not is

01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:28.240
yeah certainly millennia of cultural niche construction and uh so your language is a distillation

01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:33.760
the most efficient way that we can carve up our knowledge of our world our lived world

01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:40.560
and now the generative ai which was previously just limited to generating pictures and content

01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:47.840
and sound files and whatever um is now actually generating stuff which is it in a belief space

01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:54.320
because we have evolved language so i i think there's something quite special about generative ai

01:59:54.320 --> 02:00:01.440
and large language models simply because they actually generate content in in the context of

02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:08.080
language which you know has this um speaks to knowledge uh also it has abstracted and distilled

02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:15.200
the kind of representations of of our world yes you're in the most efficient way uh

02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:22.240
that yes i mean there are so many things we can say that they are a materialized snapshot of our

02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:28.000
sense making our abstractions our world knowledge you know of the wittgensteinian language game if

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:35.360
you like but they also have a truncating effect and they introduce inertia because it's a static

02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:41.600
model right and they are as you say that they produce traversals in word space and people

02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:47.040
don't understand that these are random trajectories with some kind of modified form of maximum

02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:54.160
likelihood estimation uh much more stochastic than people realize and we can discuss the degree of

02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:59.520
how creative they are and what creativity is maybe creativity is just a random traversal

02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:06.400
through some abstraction manifold and i i loved your poetic description of this kind of didactic

02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:11.760
relationship between humans and machines much like an extended mind and this is where prompt

02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:16.880
engineering comes in because people have realized that you can say to the language model that's not

02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:21.760
quite what i wanted can you change it a little bit and it's an interactive process and that's why

02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:27.360
as a conversational interface it's very very powerful but the problem is you can say to it

02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:32.320
no uh two plus two doesn't equal four it equals five and it will say oh i'm so sorry i actually

02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:38.720
meant five so it's it's polluting the infosphere with misinformation false news probably getting

02:01:38.720 --> 02:01:44.240
out all this kind of stuff and i never really thought the the misinformation thing was a problem

02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:51.600
because you know there's loads of misinformation out there i mean most people are full of shit

02:01:51.600 --> 02:02:00.000
frankly uh carl but now it's been industrialized and democratized on this scale and people will

02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:05.760
not bother fact-checking they'll that people see plausible text and they just take it as a given

02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:11.840
and very very soon there'll be so much information out there on the internet more than was generated

02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:16.240
by humans most of it will be generated by machines and we won't know the difference

02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:24.960
and that reminds me of you know one thing which um the ambivalence that that whole issue induces

02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:32.080
in people so you know this this um this this tendency to write in meaning an anthropomorphic

02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:39.120
size that you know the the the content generated by generative ai i've heard um actually by the

02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:44.560
by the second author of the white paper we started with it smashed the chewing test you know

02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:53.520
and i guess it has i guess it has smashed the chewing test uh um but as you say there's

02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:58.720
a price to be paid if you can't discriminate between sort of uh you actually had a nice

02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:03.120
word written i hope you're going to use uh a game which is confabulation yes yeah you know

02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:06.880
that's a great way of describing it so when i was talking about sort of interpolating generating

02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:11.840
content novel content that is an interpolation it's you know that would be a confabulation it's yeah

02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:19.360
i'm just you know mindful of the the fantasies that that were generated by uh jeff hintons weeks

02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:25.360
sleep wake algorithm also you know the original the originals of amortization of

02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:34.960
of um well yeah very short on coders i guess you'd you'd you'd think about nowadays um but the

02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:40.560
you know this notion of confabulation i think is is a splendor i haven't heard it i haven't heard

02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:45.680
it expressed like that but but that is a beauty of generative ai i guess what you're saying is if

02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:53.360
people misinterpret that as real information that could be problematic um i'm too i i'm being

02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:58.240
a bit older than you i'm slightly more mellow about this i'll just very quickly tell you a little

02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:05.680
story i had to for a friend or a colleague at least an email colleague um in america i agreed to uh

02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:12.400
write some blurb for his um uh 200 plus word book which is a philosophical model but he's also very

02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:17.920
informed in terms of artificial intelligence and he sent it to me so i speed read it at the weekend

02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:25.200
in order to write a three or four sentence blurb for the publishers um and halfway through i suddenly

02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:34.400
had the awful realization that this may have been written by cha chi tp oh no it's a wonderful book

02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:41.520
and i wasn't quite sure so i actually put in the blurb this this is a 21st century Turing test

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.760
uh there you either and you know i'll just advertise it now because this will probably come out by

02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:53.600
the time people watch this i think it's called the hidden illusion uh and either this author was

02:04:53.600 --> 02:05:00.080
very very skillful in writing the book last year and pre-empting um the public release of the of

02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:07.440
these things pre-empting to the extent he could emulate the confabulation of a large language model

02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:14.320
because part of the novel actually because the the protagonist the hero is actually working as a

02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:19.920
on large language models for a tech startup it's a love story yes but it's interwoven with things

02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:27.280
that he's actually generated on his large language machine yes and he um and that comprises part of

02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:32.960
the model um but i i generally don't know whether the rest of the narrative was was actually written

02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:36.720
by a large language model and then he's carefully gone through and triaged it

02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:44.080
that's entertainment but it is entertainment that that really challenges can be viewed as a

02:05:44.080 --> 02:05:49.120
Turing test which i suspect most people will fail and i suspect that book will be talked about

02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:55.040
simply because it's very difficult to tell how much he wrote versus how much the machine wrote

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:02.240
and you know so but that you know but as long as it's kept to entertainment that's fine if it's

02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:10.080
not then we come back to smart data mining we come back um to intelligent agents that just

02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:16.320
don't confabulate content in the context of generative AI you actually need um the ability

02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:22.160
of smart agents to go and you talked about fact checking what does that mean this basically means

02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:29.840
having an explanation or a belief at hand that provides an accurate account of all the data

02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:33.600
that is internally consistent so okay we're coming coming back to the the fundamental

02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:41.280
principles of good modeling that can be quantified but to do that you're going to have to equip those

02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:47.760
agents with autonomy and so to make equip those smart data mining machines with autonomy to be

02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:54.000
able to select the you know the right kind of data that will hopefully preclude the you know

02:06:54.000 --> 02:07:00.400
the confabulated data or things that look like data but in fact not uh not data i don't know how

02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:04.720
you do that but that's going to be the challenge for the future well exactly i mean in the free

02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:11.440
energy principle and that you have this entropy and and and it will actively seek out gpt never

02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:16.080
says to you oh i don't i don't actually know that can can you explain can you explain more

02:07:16.080 --> 02:07:21.600
different modes of understanding right so the reason why we don't confabulate is because we

02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:28.640
actually understand things and these models just learn very very superficial surface statistics

02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:33.520
um about language and and how it's used and i think it's going to change the the peer review

02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:41.280
process because now so much of this stuff slips um beneath the net and the amount of um due diligence

02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:47.200
and rigor that is required to weed out some of this stuff because most of it has gone undetected

02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:52.480
i think that's the problem people don't realize how big the problem is because the mistakes are not

02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:59.760
immediately um obvious on on the surface so um you said that we believe that developing a

02:07:59.760 --> 02:08:05.040
cyber physical network of emergent intelligence in the manner described above not only ought to but

02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:10.160
for architectural reasons must be pursued in a way that positively values and safeguards the

02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:16.720
individuality of people as well as potentially non-human persons and i wanted to bring in the

02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:23.680
is ought problem as articulated by david hume and he said it arises when one makes claims about what

02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:30.640
ought to be that are based solely on statements about what is and hume found that there seems to

02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:36.640
be a significant difference between descriptive or positive statements about what is and prescriptive

02:08:36.720 --> 02:08:41.680
or normative statements about what ought to be and uh that it's not obvious how one can

02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:46.480
coherently move from descriptive statements to and prescriptive statements and i do want to draw

02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:52.480
a little bit of an analogy here to our discussion about consciousness and i i i can bring in consciousness

02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:58.080
again but you know charmers said there's this kind of um hard problem and consciousness is a little

02:08:58.080 --> 02:09:04.960
bit extra and similarly um people say the same thing about morality that it's a little bit extra

02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:11.520
and it might not be deducible from all of this empirical data that we have in our in our models

02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:17.520
and hume of course was a famous empiricist and and i think you are one as well probably the

02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:23.840
extreme version of that so the free energy principle concerns itself with model evidence and entropy

02:09:23.840 --> 02:09:33.440
but evidence is not an ought you know so the question is how do moral states come into be in

02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:39.840
in the system right okay i didn't know about the is or stuff that's really nice um um

02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:49.280
so if i understand what you said correctly um then is is ought that completely dissolves

02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:56.240
the distinction so if you know from the point of view of the free energy principle um existing

02:09:56.240 --> 02:10:03.680
in particular characteristic states are those attracting states they are part of an attracting

02:10:03.680 --> 02:10:10.320
set that define who i am and collectively who we are if we share the same kind of world model or

02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:20.080
narrative um so they are exactly how i ought to be they are definitively defining the nature of

02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:29.360
the thing that i am so if i exist the is is just the ought um and that's quite fundamental because

02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:38.240
if you if you then say well what then does um a distributed cognition or an extended cognition

02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:44.240
you know this um or a designer environment on the web um you know being undeclared for

02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:50.400
a moment if if you think about what that might look like from a first principle account then

02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:56.960
what ought to it look what ought it to look like well it will look like what it is um but

02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:04.000
being what it is if it includes us it will be like us so it will um it will be effectively um

02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:13.680
the kind of uh system where you cannot prescribe any ortoness you know because it is what it will be

02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:23.280
it will be um it will um as we have learned in the previous conversations it will come to share

02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:29.040
a narrative in a world model with certain levels of abstraction in our own world models provided

02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:35.440
we are part of that that ecosystem part of that network one could imagine a completely independent

02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:41.120
you know a mark-off blanket between us and an information you know a a worldwide web which

02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:48.080
was never used so um so it wouldn't be a mark-off blanket even it would be two separate systems um

02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:53.680
and there will be a universe where the the world web does what it does we will never know by definition

02:11:54.240 --> 02:12:01.600
but if we are part of that if we are users of either in the sense of um triaging generative

02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:12.320
AI or in acting recommendations um or supplying data um and um you know so we are in a an exchange

02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:17.760
and therefore part of that web a part of that network part of that factor graph a node on that

02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:25.440
factor graph um then by definition the is equals ought as read by the free energy principle means

02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:32.080
that the what will happen is all the intelligent artifacts on that web will converge to some

02:12:32.080 --> 02:12:37.360
kind of common ground and some kind of common sense making another way of looking about that is

02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:42.000
that you know what are the imperatives what are the things that are being optimized if if you

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:50.800
want to use an optimization um approach um it's the um the effectively the expected free energy

02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:58.240
what is that it's just minimizing uncertainty minimizing surprises it is not making paper clips

02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:06.480
it is not you ought to be good to mankind or you ought to increase prosperity um it is not

02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:16.800
monothematic um pre-specified heuristics about this or that it is just um it is all about

02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:23.680
resolving uncertainty and when there are preferences that underwrite that uncertainty just

02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:29.120
technically just in case this sounds a bit too hand-waving the expected free energy is literally

02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:34.720
the sum of the expected information gain and the expected value where the value or the negative

02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:38.880
expected free energy is the sum of the expected information gain expected value where the expected

02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:47.120
where the value is the um the log probability of a characteristic outcome now crucially in that

02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:56.720
statement where you now read value or utility or the ortness um as um a a probability distribution

02:13:56.720 --> 02:14:03.120
over the space of outcomes notice that this is now specified over all possible outcomes

02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:10.240
so it now becomes a way of specifying ortness that just is um in the spirit of multiple constraints

02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:16.080
over all dimensions of outcomes not the amount of money I make or the number of paper clips I make

02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:22.640
but over everything and over everything then converts this effectively into a sort of the

02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:27.040
solution to a multiple constraint satisfaction problem where the multiple constraints are

02:14:27.040 --> 02:14:35.120
definitive of what I am and if I am embedded in a network of sympathetic agents and artifacts

02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:42.880
what we are so baked into this kind of belief sharing there should be a harmony and a mutual

02:14:42.880 --> 02:14:48.800
understanding at various levels I mean I'm not talking about sort of direct sort of language

02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:53.840
to language you know it could be some sensory substitution devices that have a sort of very

02:14:53.840 --> 02:15:00.720
elemental very fast sympathy with with our bodies for example um but at least from the

02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:08.720
point of view of the information geometries that there will be a convergence which will be effectively

02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:15.040
if you're a quantum physicist an entanglement if you're um if you're a uh a dynamical systems

02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:21.520
theory person a generalized synchrony of everybody in that web that is necessarily

02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:28.080
a facet of free energy minimization on the one hand on the other hand it's also just a statement

02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:33.360
of the steady non-equilibrium steady states to which any distributed network will ultimately

02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:40.640
converge to it can be no other way in principle yeah I mean many people have an intuition that

02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:47.120
when designing utility functions if you look at how markets work and so on that utility and value

02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:53.600
are orthogonal and and then we have institutions like the church and government and and so on to

02:15:53.600 --> 02:16:00.000
introduce value pressures um onto the utility function and I guess what I'm what I'm getting

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.040
from you is certainly from an evolutionary perspective that they they need to not be orthogonal

02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:09.920
and um I mean in in religion for example I mean I'm not religious myself but they

02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:15.200
they have um they're moral realists and you and you have moral relativists and and they they say that

02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:22.320
um we need to hold something sacred uh because otherwise you know if everything's sacred then

02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:26.160
nothing's sacred at all so we need to have a difference between the sacred and and the profane

02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:32.560
but um they they think that uh morality shouldn't be achieved through consensus and this is this is

02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:37.440
what we need to behave properly I don't believe that but I'm very interested to know where morality

02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:44.080
comes from and I think you kind of alluded to that in in in your answer so um are they

02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:50.400
hardwired in the brain or is it just a kind of like constructivist social phenomenon I think it's

02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:55.040
a constructivist social phenomena but and over a transgenerational sort of niche construction

02:16:55.040 --> 02:17:02.480
as well but also um in the moment um and constructivist in the sense that the we're not born with

02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:07.760
these things so these things are very much part of cultural um culturally evolutionary thinking and

02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:14.400
sort of you know um um nurture um that we inherit not just from our mum but also our mum's mum a

02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:23.120
mum mum you're all the way back um so they are in the brain they are learned which are um distinct

02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:29.280
from innate priors that underwrite my homeostasis so there are certain beliefs I have sub-personal

02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:36.640
beliefs about the way I should behave um that are held with incredible precision and conviction

02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:42.880
sub-personally that they're hardwired epigenetically and these would include everything that um

02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:49.200
leads to homeostasis and then you build upon that and you get to our stasis and you build upon that

02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:53.760
and you can probably at some level get to the right way to behave morally and ethically at school

02:17:53.760 --> 02:18:00.480
with your in the playground for example and so as you you know so mathematically the the

02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:07.680
distinction between these sort of um very fixed um prior preferences or prior beliefs

02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:13.200
that are basically just an encoding of beliefs about the states I characteristically occupy or

02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:20.400
aspire to or to or narratives that I would pursue um they are very very precise in some dimensions

02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:25.520
and you said you know they are or are not orthogonal you know it was exactly that sort of multi-dimensional

02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:32.320
aspect to writing down value of something which would be possible to do for a human being unless

02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:39.920
you give me your your DNA and also your mother's womb I couldn't actually write write write it down

02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:47.760
very very easily but you know the specification has to be upon all dimensions some of which will

02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:53.200
be written down with great precision and others will be much more flexible and I think when it

02:18:53.200 --> 02:19:00.960
comes to um writing down values over attributes that do not yet exist because you haven't grown your

02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:06.960
deep generative model sufficiently deep in order to have that do abstraction then clearly those

02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:14.000
kinds of beliefs about the way I should behave um are not even specified at birth but they have to

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:19.040
be learned through interactions with other people so I guess I'm trying to bring to the notion that

02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:30.640
it's perfectly okay to have a spectrum of different convictions about the way to behave

02:19:30.640 --> 02:19:38.320
that can be absolutist or it can be more forgiving and relativistic simply and you would be able to

02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:44.560
simulate that just by writing down very very precise beliefs versus less precise beliefs

02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:52.000
the second key thing here is that we're talking about when it comes to

02:19:52.800 --> 02:20:01.360
the building beliefs about the way I should behave that basically presupposes you've got to a

02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:06.880
sufficient developmental stage to have selfhood which not everybody gets that far about severe

02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:14.160
autism you wouldn't and if you know certain other lower life forms may never get that far but

02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:20.080
certainly you have to have um selfhood you have to have a model of that selfhood and then you have

02:20:20.080 --> 02:20:27.920
to um um ask um have a model of um others that may be actually be a prerequisite before you have a

02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:34.640
model of self and then other kinds of people so um when it comes to making decisions of a moral

02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:42.160
ethical sort you know it's just inferring what would I do in this context given I am this kind

02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:48.560
of person and my limited understanding of some social signs is it is a little that's a little

02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:55.040
bit more complicated that is not necessarily what should I do in this context given I'm that kind of

02:20:55.040 --> 02:21:04.400
person it's what do you think I should do given I am in this context given what you think what kind

02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:10.240
of person you think I am so basically I'm trying to work out what you think what kind of person you

02:21:10.240 --> 02:21:16.240
think I am if I can infer that on the basis of our exchanges and my epistemic foraging and my sort

02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:22.560
of self-evidencing through language um then um I can then decide what is right or wrong so it's

02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:27.600
just basically an inference you know what's the probability of making that decision with those

02:21:27.600 --> 02:21:34.960
outcomes given my world model um if I am that kind of person versus that kind of person um to solve

02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:39.520
that I need to know what kind of person I am and that I can just get from them or I can get from

02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:46.800
my convert my correspondent or my peer group um or I can choose to you know my in-group from the

02:21:46.800 --> 02:21:52.480
social media or the the kind of television news that that I subscribe to so you know we're talking

02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:58.400
about before about sort of this utopia of um generalized synchrony and perfect quantum entanglement

02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:04.560
and we're all in perfect harmony of course it doesn't quite work like that there's a scale free

02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:11.520
sort of specialization and you know different you're at a bigger scale different Markov blankets

02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:16.160
where you get in groups and institutions and uh because of that scale freeness and because of

02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:20.880
it we're all quintessentially curious in our self-organization we're always exploring other

02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:26.880
ways of being um whilst trying to find the shared narrative and common ground with people like me

02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:36.000
my family my institution my um my sort of um theological commitments um there will always be

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:41.680
other kinds of me and I and I can sometimes you know I can I can sort of people that kind of me

02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:47.520
or the other kind of me so in that context it's really a really interesting question about um

02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:56.160
really inferring you know of all the ways I can behave what is the most likely way of behaving

02:22:56.160 --> 02:23:01.520
and if you can you know if you if you look at morals and ethics through that lens then you

02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:07.120
have now a calculus of being able to write these things down in terms of alternative ways of responding

02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:12.000
in a given situation and crucially you mentioned before uncertainty so precision is just the inverse

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:18.720
uncertainty the confidence with which I can assert no I will always do this yeah as opposed to I'm

02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:26.000
you know 80% sure I'm that kind of person but also noticing you're now conditioning your moral

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:32.720
position or your ethical position um on being a particular kind of person and of course we can

02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:37.280
all be a different kind of person I can be a teacher I can be a student I can be a parent

02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:43.760
you know I can be a friend um you know all of these will call to four different sets of

02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:48.480
prior beliefs because they're all conditioned on the kind of the the library or the repertoire of

02:23:48.480 --> 02:23:54.480
ways of being a human being which I learned from you or my mum and everybody else on television

02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:02.480
fantastic I wanted to touch on this idea of um I mean as you said you believe that it's socially

02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:06.720
constructed which rather gets away from this notion of some people believe that it's kind of

02:24:06.720 --> 02:24:13.760
hardwired and then there's the notion of is our you know our values might be changing faster than

02:24:13.760 --> 02:24:20.080
evolution essentially which necessitates the need to have some kind of societal pressures or

02:24:20.080 --> 02:24:26.720
governance if you like and I do believe that we're in a new regime now I mean people always say oh

02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:34.000
the sky's falling down everything's changing but now we are in the information world and things

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:39.520
are moving at a scale and magnitude that they haven't done before and our values are changing

02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:44.400
much faster than they have done before and what you are talking to is very interesting about this

02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:49.840
kind of fractionation so there are macroscopic pressures and there are microscopic pressures

02:24:49.840 --> 02:24:56.080
there's the internet and so on and I just wonder from your perspective how do we how do we wrestle

02:24:56.080 --> 02:25:03.200
with that because there are we've never been in in in a more kind of pluralistic interconnected

02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:10.560
environment and how does that affect us yeah I mean these are big questions I'm sure you have

02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:20.160
your own answers to um but yeah I think I think that that that sort of fast-moving um globalized

02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:28.560
exchange um that that that does speak to a deep pathology um and I have a deja vu I'm sure we've

02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:33.920
spoken about this before but sort of you know um Zuckerberg and the you know the genius boy

02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:40.720
races of of that the previous decade um talking about connectivity as somehow being a good thing

02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:47.840
I find quite frightening remember that we've been talking about um structure and existence

02:25:47.840 --> 02:25:53.120
right through to morals and ethics in the context of helping the right kind of sparsity that gives

02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:58.240
you the right kind of individuation of things from the world and within any given thing the

02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:03.920
right kind of structure that allows it to act gracefully uh and in harmony with that world

02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:10.560
every point it's the absence of connectivity that defines the structures so if you destroy

02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:17.760
that sparsity by over connecting over globalizing you will um essentially destroy it would basically

02:26:17.760 --> 02:26:23.840
cancer um you know so if you look at this is my clever thing if you look at um you know

02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:29.200
sort of a cancerous cell as a basically a self-organizing system who has forgotten its

02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:36.320
boundaries yes then you are um you have a metaphor for the kind of thing that happens

02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:41.760
if you do not respect the sparsity of communication and the um the the joyful

02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:50.480
isolation that there is existence behind your own Markov blanket so every affront to

02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:59.120
um that uh maintaining that sparsity smart data carefully sampled not being overwhelmed

02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:04.720
with a deluge of um very imprecise data that it makes it very difficult for me to actually

02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:09.440
go and smartly sample and work out what would happen if I go and look over there or look on

02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:17.200
that website um you know so what that would suggest to me is that um there will be um

02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:23.600
um there will be and I take your point that that things are changing um I I initially thought to

02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:28.160
myself well no hang on a second because all of the information and the sense of making and all

02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:34.080
the kind of um exchange of information we're talking about is about constructs that do not exist

02:27:34.080 --> 02:27:41.280
when I am born um you know you can't have you can't have misinformation uh from the um what you

02:27:41.280 --> 02:27:48.240
called the confabulation what I in my blurb refer to as the the flighty ramblings of gtp uh um

02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:54.800
you know you can't that has no meaning for some you know a child that has not yet learned to read

02:27:54.800 --> 02:28:00.480
or write or to you know so this is something that has to be below the scale of evolution

02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:05.680
so I was just thinking that it's okay you know this is a with you know this is limited to um

02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:13.920
to um your each um each each uh generation but I think that's probably a false false

02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:22.000
comfort um because you know we were talking about sort of um evolutionary psychology and

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:25.520
cultural evolution as well and I think that's what you were talking about I think that that

02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:33.360
that then is if things are speeding up um that usually means you've lost um you've lost precision

02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:39.120
in your prior beliefs which means that the precision the informativeness the salience the

02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:45.840
reliability of information now takes precedence and you increase your learning rate you become uh

02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:50.960
in schizophrenia that we call as jumping to conclusions on the basis of sparse information

02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:57.360
you're basically looking out there not inside uh to um resolve uncertainty about states of affairs

02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:04.320
because you've lost confidence in your in your very structured prior beliefs so if things are

02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:14.080
speeding up that basically means that um whoever is now generating um and garnering that information

02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:21.120
in the information age um is has lost um has lost confidence or precision in the in their own

02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:28.240
convictions and prior beliefs and possibly information morality uh so what's going to happen um

02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:38.400
I read um Carlo Brevelli's book um uh uh yesterday in fact he's he's he's he wrote in

02:29:38.400 --> 02:29:43.920
2014 just sort of seven things you need to know about physics which was originally um published

02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:51.200
each chapter as you know in the in the the um the sunday newspapers with potentials to scientific

02:29:51.200 --> 02:29:56.080
discourse and then he ends up with a very very pessimistic he thinks it's all over

02:29:57.600 --> 02:30:03.520
I was actually compelled with by that he you read the last few pages uh yeah he makes exactly the

02:30:03.520 --> 02:30:08.800
same points that we we've just been discussing from the point of view of physics um at different

02:30:08.800 --> 02:30:16.240
levels um and and and he you know he jelly thinks it's over it's uh I know it's so hard because it's

02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:20.640
like the hill climbing problem and you can't see behind the next hill and there are always people

02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:26.560
who were uh you know techno luddites and people who think that the sky is falling down it's genuinely

02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:34.080
hard to know just just to finish on on this um ethics point uh Lisa Felben Barrett was a constructionist

02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:38.720
she had a book called how emotions are made the secret life of the brain

02:30:38.720 --> 02:30:45.280
and she thought emotions themselves are socially constructed would you subscribe to that view

02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:51.360
and I think I probably would I mean she she writes very wisely and has thought for many

02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:56.880
decades about the you know the nature of emotion I think you know I would say yes absolutely it's

02:30:56.880 --> 02:31:04.000
simply because you know the the notion of building generative models in a neurodevelopmental

02:31:05.040 --> 02:31:11.280
context is an act of construction you know it's a free energy minimizing process that is

02:31:12.880 --> 02:31:17.360
that explains why we construct better and better explanations which are sort of

02:31:17.360 --> 02:31:25.280
you know carving nature in its joints in our head and part of that is is not just about the

02:31:25.280 --> 02:31:31.200
state of the external extraceptive world but also our internal world our interceptions our

02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:39.120
gut feelings our respiration and everything else so so her big thing and indeed other people

02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:46.160
thinking along similar lines people like Anil Seth and sorry well would really always how

02:31:46.160 --> 02:31:52.720
nod towards interception and embodiment but now beyond the the situated cognition kind of

02:31:52.720 --> 02:31:58.640
embodiment you we were talking about before but actually now about the the physical body the the

02:31:59.520 --> 02:32:09.840
the beast machine as as Anil Seth would would say so the physiology so having a constructed

02:32:09.840 --> 02:32:15.680
explanation or hypothesis for the way that I put together my gut feelings my interceptive

02:32:15.680 --> 02:32:21.680
signals with situational awareness derived from extraceptive sensations and indeed what I do about

02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:26.800
I think leads to a very compelling notion of constructed emotions so for example

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:37.360
I am I can infer I can use the explanation on the hypothesis I am frightened as the best explanation

02:32:38.240 --> 02:32:47.760
for why my heart is racing why I feel frozen proprioceptively why I have cardio acceleration

02:32:48.480 --> 02:32:59.920
and why I have why I cannot discern that dark figure in this dark alley in a city which I've

02:32:59.920 --> 02:33:08.000
never been in before all of these myriad of sensations and my low level constructs now

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:13.920
succumb to a simple explanation oh I'm frightened yes that explains everything explains my racing

02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:18.960
heart explains this fact I can't I can't see who that is your the potential predation that

02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:25.680
would follow from from that also interestingly because of you got this circular causality in

02:33:25.680 --> 02:33:35.440
the inactivism the fact that I am frightened means I expect to cardio accelerate and of course under

02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:39.920
active inference that's exactly what will happen because you're acting to generate the evidence

02:33:39.920 --> 02:33:46.880
for your predictions and for your your your hypothesis about your you your you and your

02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:52.160
lived world but also you as you hypothesize yourself to be so you've got this sort of

02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:58.720
closing the circle in a sort of James Langian kind of sense the yes I explain my my current

02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:05.760
set of sensations as having the emotion of fear that itself induces the very evidence that I was

02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:10.960
trying to so you've got this sort of auto poetic self-fulfilling prophecy that you know

02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:17.680
is just idea motor theory but in the interceptive domain yes so I think if you read constructed

02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:22.160
that's right but I notice he says socially constructed which I I guess is okay yes if

02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:27.760
you're taught that you can be have these you know this kind of fine grain repertoire of

02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:33.040
feelings or you can use these to explain your own sensations yes I I would imagine it is molded by

02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:38.960
you know by by convention and you know by the culture which you come come from in the same way

02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:45.840
that you know Eskimo is having 12 words for snow would give them a finer visual acuity and

02:34:45.840 --> 02:34:52.800
visual discrimination of whiteness I I'm sure that exactly the same kind of cultural inculturation

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:59.760
speaks to different kinds of elixir thymia and you know the coarse grainness of my

02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:05.040
repertoire of explanations for emotional states of mind the best explained me in my

02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:09.200
you know in my interactions now car I know you have a background in psychotherapy

02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:19.040
can people be evil it doesn't exist in the diagnostic criteria I believe

02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:26.320
no it doesn't um so that was out of the blue question which I've never

02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:32.640
been asked in public before um as a psychiatrist I think it would be rather difficult

02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:39.680
to conceive of that um there you know there are certain there are certain patterns of behavior

02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:45.280
and um I do have some psychotherapy but it's group psychotherapy but really I'm a psychiatrist

02:35:45.280 --> 02:35:50.080
so you know there's a distinction I think right um from a professional point of view

02:35:50.720 --> 02:35:54.400
you know I'd be more like a biological my apologies I didn't mean to

02:35:54.480 --> 02:35:59.840
honestly no no I mean the psychotherapy is an important aspect of of psychiatry it's just that

02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:07.920
psychotherapists have to undergo you know five six years of training to become psychotherapists I

02:36:07.920 --> 02:36:15.920
did two two years of very baby uh psychotherapy training um but um you know in terms of the

02:36:15.920 --> 02:36:21.600
neurology and psychiatry you can certainly get sort of certain kinds of personality disorders

02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:30.000
and certain kinds of psychopathy that would normally be associated with evil um evil behavior

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:37.040
and it normally basically um transcends the social norms so it comes back again to basically me

02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:41.600
trying to work out what kind of person do you should I be which you know my only point of

02:36:41.600 --> 02:36:47.360
reference is you so you know how should how do I think you think I should behave and when that um

02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:54.080
when that kind of self-modeling doesn't work then you will be you know you will have um

02:36:54.080 --> 02:37:00.480
behaviors which are so far from the social norms and morally acceptable I guess you can label them

02:37:00.480 --> 02:37:09.280
as being evil when could they arise well when you fail to um have any theory of mind for example

02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:18.160
if I am an able to see you as a another thing like me so I may see you as a French or a car or

02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:23.520
some sort of your camera an artifact um you're not a person you know you don't have intentional

02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:28.720
dispositions or you don't have we don't have a share now that I couldn't talk to you in in any

02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:36.080
really deep sense um then obviously I can never ask the question how do you think I should behave

02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:40.320
because you do not you know you don't have that kind of belief or that kind of

02:37:40.320 --> 02:37:45.840
intentional stance in relation to me um so you could imagine that some you know some

02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:55.200
kinds of um psychiatric conditions that preclude proper theory of mind and you know

02:37:55.200 --> 02:38:04.160
the ability to sympathize or empathize or bond would enable the expression of certain behaviors

02:38:04.160 --> 02:38:08.160
which would be regarded by other people as evil whether the person prosecuting them thought they

02:38:08.160 --> 02:38:13.120
were evil or not would cause be a mute question one you never know because it's inside her mark

02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:18.720
off blanket but uh but also uh from her point of view there is no reference and that is the problem

02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:23.200
yes there you are um but you can certainly have somebody else out from the outside saying that

02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:29.760
is evil um you normally don't you try not to do that when you're doing psychiatry or psychotherapy

02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:36.400
you have to have conditional positive regard yes so you you can't really impute you know nastiness

02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:43.520
or evil or bad intentions um yes and it's one of these things where um autonomy comes into it

02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:50.640
free will comes into it possibly it it you know evil itself is a constructed concept um which

02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:56.400
exists in in our language and and it's something which some people will perceive depending on

02:38:56.480 --> 02:39:03.760
lots of other things they believe yes but um okay and talking about ethics in AI

02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:13.200
it seems to suffer from a similar um form of fractionation in the sense that different people

02:39:13.200 --> 02:39:18.560
with different beliefs think that it should be enforced in in different ways what's the solution

02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:29.600
well i'd take a um sort of deflationary approach um and it won't be a terribly informed approach but

02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:36.080
you know my answer would be well if you get the right um the right optimization the right

02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:44.240
imperatives in play then that kind of question just goes away um i think um one way that i have heard

02:39:44.240 --> 02:39:49.120
this discuss now i actually enjoy discussing this with you know with with my colleagues and friends

02:39:50.960 --> 02:39:56.720
is that there is this dystopian meme you know the singularity the paper clips paradox everything you

02:39:56.720 --> 02:40:04.480
see and you know sort of um you know on comic films of a futuristic dystopian dark very entertaining

02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:09.840
i mean that's the first things i go for when going to the watch list but but but they they are all

02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:16.080
dystopian in a rather unconvincing and fantastical way um and you have to ask yourself well why

02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:25.120
why are they um why do people have this sort of dystopian um uh view of um realizing the potential

02:40:25.120 --> 02:40:35.280
of um you know what used to be called you know AGI or um and um i think it usually inherits um

02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:42.160
from that distinction when you were you introduced the is and the ought yeah so what should a good AGI

02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:49.440
what ought it to do and who's in charge of saying who what it ought to do is it meant to make money

02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:56.240
is it meant to make profits is it meant to save lives is it meant to um make paper clips um

02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:04.160
of course that question just goes away if you're thinking um in terms of um the free energy principle

02:41:04.160 --> 02:41:10.400
and an active inference and belief sharing so the only agenda in sharing beliefs is to resolve

02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:18.080
curiosity so you know you know i i cannot prescribe what you should do or what an intelligent

02:41:18.080 --> 02:41:25.600
artifact should do um other than put constraints on every kinds of outcomes that are expected to

02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:31.680
encounter so i can certainly write down constraints in the in the spirit again of either um a multiple

02:41:31.680 --> 02:41:36.800
constraint satisfaction from a sort of um uh an engineering point of view or from a mathematician's

02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:41.680
point of view the constraints inherent in uh jane's constraint maximum tree principle which is another

02:41:41.680 --> 02:41:46.480
way of reading the free energy principle writing down those constraints but within those constraints

02:41:46.480 --> 02:41:50.960
so these are the no-go areas you were actually talking about you mentioned explicitly before

02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:57.200
so there are certain things you never do um or put it another way uh with relatively high precision

02:41:57.200 --> 02:42:04.160
there is a these outcomes are highly implausible and if you find yourself in these outcomes you

02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:09.920
you remove yourself immediately so that's quite easy to write down but then within those constraints

02:42:09.920 --> 02:42:15.920
you know what is imperative it's just to gather information about what about you it's just showing

02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:23.760
an interest in you so become your psychotherapist uh you know well could could i um push back a

02:42:23.760 --> 02:42:30.400
tiny bit so i think part of the reason why we have this focus on ethics is because of the

02:42:30.400 --> 02:42:36.720
centralization of ai um things like facebook they're controlled by centralized corporations

02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:44.000
and what you're leading to is far more interesting it's this multi-agent diffusion stratification

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:51.600
fractionation nicely and that's i agree in many ways might solve the problem because it would it

02:42:51.600 --> 02:43:00.240
would emerge and then you can discuss whether morality was part of why we survived it it's not

02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:06.880
orthogonal but then i might still push back and say well what if the wrong thing emerged so what

02:43:06.880 --> 02:43:12.080
if we do need to introduce governance because in in this active inference multi-agent setting with

02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:19.040
humans and machines um we started to see behaviors emerge which we didn't agree with um how could

02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:25.840
we then place value pressures on on that um that's an excellent question and you also make that very

02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:32.480
important point which i think needs to be foreground that yeah so when i was talking about

02:43:34.480 --> 02:43:40.400
belief sharing and distributed the the age of intelligence you know it was exactly this

02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:47.680
distributed ecosystem a democratized kind of belief sharing and data sharing um where the

02:43:47.680 --> 02:43:53.600
data is small bits of smart data that are essential to to to reduce and so it was very much this

02:43:55.200 --> 02:44:02.960
walking away from large data monolithic bits of say large language models for example that can

02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:10.160
scrape data from you know from wherever they can get it so that i think that's an important

02:44:10.160 --> 02:44:19.440
distinction which which which um um qualifies my um dismissing of all these dystopian outcomes so

02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:25.760
i'm assuming that that so spending a billion uh or a million dollars on get training some some

02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:30.400
deep neural network is not going to be happening in the future and and we're going to be buying

02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:34.720
cheap and cheerful edge devices and little apps that are smart and just and just you know

02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:40.320
go go and get the data that we need to know in terms of resolving on-center about what about

02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:46.960
you know what what what we are going to do next um but um so so i thought that was a really important

02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:51.840
point and of course i forgot your your major question which was what which was the oh well so

02:44:51.840 --> 02:44:59.200
if we did have let's say en masse yeah what do you do about that yeah um well again i'm not sure

02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:03.600
i'm going to give you a terribly informed response but you know i think the notion of an ecosystem

02:45:03.600 --> 02:45:11.680
is quite central here and one if you like um tenet of that white paper was a nod to natural

02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:16.400
intelligence and natural processes and what has actually happened what does actually happen in

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:24.800
as a natural scientist so if you have um if you do imagine uh you're an ecosystem of intelligence

02:45:24.800 --> 02:45:32.240
in the future it will be subject to exactly the same um dynamics and pressures that that we have

02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:40.320
currently in terms of you know um cooperation and competition and wars and geopolitical issues

02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:44.480
that that's that's part of the ecosystem and then you will have the normal problems of

02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:53.600
democratization and access and um so um there's you know you cannot prescribe aughts for this

02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:58.000
because then you have to choose who's going to prescribe the aughts so you have to have a very

02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:03.760
libertarian approach to this so the emphasis and now it's not really me talking so much but now the

02:46:03.760 --> 02:46:07.920
the architects of the future the generation below who are sort of you know thinking about

02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:16.400
the legacy they're going to leave their children um so a lot of emphasis um is from what i see in

02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:22.320
conversations i have in my world which may not be um you know microsoft or or you know big tech

02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:30.880
who are still focused on big data um in my world it's much more upon um putting constraints in

02:46:30.880 --> 02:46:40.960
place that preclude the the the the the emergence of autocracies that um resolve uncertainty about

02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:46.960
others by making them all like themselves basically that's one way to get harmony is to

02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:53.760
make everybody do what um do the same thing um so but but i you can write down uh so there's a lot

02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:59.920
of attention is being paid and i'm talking here about the the next generation of uh of message

02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:05.680
passing um that will support that information sharing and belief sharing so a lot of attention is

02:47:05.680 --> 02:47:11.520
being paid not just to generalize it from just hypertext but into a sort of more abstract hyperspace

02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:19.920
so literally hyperspace message passing and uh sorry um languages and transaction protocols

02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:25.600
but also the credentials and the contracts that underwrite that message passing so you know

02:47:25.600 --> 02:47:32.720
a lot of emphasis on contracts shared agreements in terms of what data is shareable and who has

02:47:32.720 --> 02:47:38.720
the credentials to share that and and having that distributed so not in a in a blockchain sense but

02:47:38.720 --> 02:47:46.160
you know uh in some workable um shareable sense so i think if if if one gets the standards right

02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:52.320
and a lot of work is being currently done um um under the auspices of the iEEE for example with

02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:59.120
the spatial web foundation one gets that right that i think that these catastrophic dystopian

02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:07.600
abuses or your emergence of autocracies in an in an age of intelligence will um will be precluded

02:48:07.600 --> 02:48:14.160
simply because you've put the right constraints in in place but you know given given that you are

02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:20.720
committed to creating an ecology that is truly democratized and and open you know there are no

02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:28.160
guarantees are there i hope my friends don't hear me saying this but yeah if you aspire to an ecology

02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:33.760
you are you're you're creating a nature on the web basically yes which we are participants and

02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:40.240
that will have its you know that will have its own challenges so um you wrote a beautiful paper

02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:47.280
called am i self-conscious or does self-organization entail self-consciousness and Keith and i agree

02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:53.840
that this is probably the best quote we've ever seen in our lives you said the proposal on offer

02:48:53.840 --> 02:49:00.320
here is that the mind comes into being when self-evidencing has a temporal thickness or counterfactual

02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:06.240
depth which grounds inferences about the consequences of my action on this view consciousness

02:49:06.240 --> 02:49:12.800
is nothing more than inference about my future namely the self-evidencing consequences of what

02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:18.640
i can do and uh we spoke with you um last time i think and we invoked charmers and the hard problem

02:49:18.640 --> 02:49:23.680
and so on and we were talking about qualia and subjective states and you know in a dialogue

02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:29.360
and all this kind of thing and um you responded that different feeling states are hypotheses about

02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:34.560
how i'm feeling at the moment and then it would use all the messages and belief updating and all

02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:39.200
the planning and estimates of uncertainty which attend that planning the precision or estimates

02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:45.120
of uncertainty play heavier roles the higher you get in the hierarchy and this rather leads to this

02:49:45.120 --> 02:49:50.640
idea of planes of consciousness you know we said we'd kind of defer this discussion to later so

02:49:51.360 --> 02:49:56.720
consciousness is something which um there's no operational measure for it there's no touring

02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:02.160
test for consciousness but it's something that we all experience and we feel and and it's with us

02:50:02.800 --> 02:50:08.880
um so could you talk to let's say the these planes of consciousness is consciousness everywhere

02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:12.720
or are we only aware of the plane where most of the work is being done

02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:20.240
okay excellent final question again i'm not the best person to answer this question because i

02:50:20.320 --> 02:50:27.680
you know the 300 principle as i'm sure i've said before is not a theory or a principle that would

02:50:27.680 --> 02:50:32.240
generate theories of consciousness um but there are lots of people are very interested in this

02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:39.920
including yourself obviously and not your viewers um actually i should say also um there's um first

02:50:39.920 --> 02:50:46.960
of all this has become a big question in the sort of r and d part of industry also the

02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:51.600
Templeton Foundation are starting to fund a number of adversarial research collaborations

02:50:52.560 --> 02:50:59.440
to really drill down on that thing that you are picking up on which is to be conscious to

02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:05.920
actually have sentient behavior um requires this planning aspect this going out into the future

02:51:05.920 --> 02:51:13.840
you know it's put it very very simply um i um conscious or sentient just because i have the

02:51:13.840 --> 02:51:21.120
capacity to plan which also entails some kinds of free selection amongst alternative courses of

02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:26.400
action which is something that a thermostat wouldn't have something the weather doesn't have you know

02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:30.000
there are lots of self-organizing systems that don't have the capacity to select

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:37.280
amongst a number of counterfactual um policies so for me that's that's a sort of um bright line

02:51:37.280 --> 02:51:46.480
between sort of um sentience at least and and uh and self-organization that is not um sentient

02:51:46.480 --> 02:51:51.440
and that that distinction is exactly what is being tested in this adversarial research

02:51:51.440 --> 02:51:58.080
collaboration funded by the Templeton Foundation it's called Intrepid it's contrasting information

02:51:58.080 --> 02:52:06.640
IIT integrated information theory with various um predictive processing either of a sort of

02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:11.600
non-representationalist or in an active sort so it's a really interesting issue um and it all

02:52:11.600 --> 02:52:17.600
comes back down to agency and acting in the long term and I guess your question here is you know

02:52:17.600 --> 02:52:25.280
what level um where at what point do you get um qualitative experience and at what point do you

02:52:25.280 --> 02:52:28.880
do you think it's you that's having that qualitative experience is that what you meant

02:52:28.880 --> 02:52:33.360
well I mean just just to comment on what you've said uh and Chalmers says something very similar

02:52:33.360 --> 02:52:37.760
actually he's a computationalist functionalist and thinks that there are you know certain patterns

02:52:37.760 --> 02:52:42.640
of information processing and causal structures and counterfactuals and so on if you take the

02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:46.800
episode and remove the counter counterfactuals it's not conscious anymore but what you're

02:52:46.800 --> 02:52:52.960
saying is interesting about this kind of hierarchy so the heart for example um that doesn't really

02:52:52.960 --> 02:52:57.200
have many affordances it doesn't have many counterfactual plans or things it can do it just

02:52:57.200 --> 02:53:02.480
has to beat all of the time so that so you would say that the heart is not conscious whereas the

02:53:02.480 --> 02:53:08.640
the upper plane is conscious yes yes I would yes yes yeah that's a good one I hadn't thought about that

02:53:08.640 --> 02:53:16.160
yeah yeah that's right sorted that one um I mean yeah you know I mean you know I think there are

02:53:16.160 --> 02:53:20.960
interesting issues of different levels you know planes or levels of consciousness you know there's

02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:28.080
minimal selfhood um and then if it's the case that sort of consciousness as a process entails

02:53:28.080 --> 02:53:32.560
some kind of action you have to now think about sort of what is action on the inside what is

02:53:32.560 --> 02:53:38.560
mental action and then what what normally what ends up doing is thinking in terms of attention and the

02:53:38.560 --> 02:53:44.080
the kind of routing and selection the smart data sampling but now not by moving my eyes or by

02:53:45.520 --> 02:53:52.880
going to the right wikipedia page but by basically switching on and off various sources of input from

02:53:52.880 --> 02:53:57.440
lower in the hierarchy so you know I repeat from the point of view of psychology that would be like

02:53:57.440 --> 02:54:02.640
endogenous attention so that would be the mental action that makes it conscious processing

02:54:03.840 --> 02:54:10.560
and then you have to ask well at what point is that you know is that necessary to actually

02:54:10.560 --> 02:54:16.160
experience anything and I think I think you probably there are people who argue yes that is

02:54:16.160 --> 02:54:22.960
actually a prerequisite for a qualitative experience so you have to be able to select it

02:54:22.960 --> 02:54:28.240
what does that mean you have to be able to attend to it and you have to be the source of that sort

02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:33.200
of enabling attention that active sampling inside the brain so now there's a deep link between

02:54:33.920 --> 02:54:40.240
qualia or qualitative experience and attention and conscious processing that of the kind that

02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:47.520
is accompanied by qualitative experience I think is important it also interestingly also speaks to

02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:52.800
your dynamic Markov blankets because of course by switching off and selecting various bits of

02:54:53.840 --> 02:54:59.520
neuronal message passing in the brain you're reconfiguring your Markov blanket out though

02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:05.600
some somebody's Markov blanket lower down which is an interesting an interesting notion but

02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:14.800
it that also fits comfortably with Thomas Metzinger's and Vanya's advice's formulations

02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:19.920
I actually Yakov Linsky as well formulations of

02:55:21.760 --> 02:55:28.640
phenology in the context of transparency and opacity that you know what what renders something

02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:36.000
opaque in the sense oh I see now if you like as a projection on a murky window

02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:41.200
it's not just going straight into it's not direct perception it's it's your it's now

02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:46.640
something I am looking at oh I'm looking at a red apple and it may well be exactly this

02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:52.960
controllability the fact you can attend or disignore it so I think there's a nice link there

02:55:53.040 --> 02:55:58.160
from the from the point of view of certain philosophical takes on self-modeling and

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:06.480
phenomenological transparency and opacity and the mechanics of belief updating when it comes to

02:56:06.480 --> 02:56:13.280
selection through basically a getting the Kalman gain right or you know doing the root getting the

02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:18.960
routine right same exactly the same mechanism you get in transformers so they call it attention

02:56:18.960 --> 02:56:24.800
it's just basically a waiting in that context it's a waiting that inherits or is inferred from

02:56:24.800 --> 02:56:28.880
something in the past a pattern in the past but if it if that waiting comes from higher

02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:34.320
in abstract hierarchical model that would look very much like in Dodger's attention

02:56:34.320 --> 02:56:39.920
and it starts to have the look and feel of a mental action that would you know bring you

02:56:39.920 --> 02:56:46.560
closer to it but whether you would know that you were deploying attention and whether you

02:56:46.560 --> 02:56:50.800
could tell somebody else oh I've got a qualitative experience or whether you become a philosopher

02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:54.640
as well your life puzzling about the fact that I can tell somebody else I'm having a qualitative

02:56:54.640 --> 02:57:00.080
experience there's the different planes I think you'd have to you'd have to contend with beautiful

02:57:00.080 --> 02:57:04.400
beautiful do you have any final thought I mean we've got a machine learning audience so any calls

02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:11.200
to action how can they start looking at active inference where should they look and what would

02:57:11.200 --> 02:57:17.840
you like to tell them I was very charming of you I'm not going to tell them anything I'm just

02:57:20.320 --> 02:57:26.080
if it's if it's the right kind of approach that you know it'll already be out there it'll be

02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:30.080
self-evident it's just a question I think of people finding their own language and their own

02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:39.120
their own rhetoric or calculus that makes sense of it and the other reason I'm not going to say

02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:44.800
anything is I've spoken far too much and I'm trying to be a recluse and the more I'm calling

02:57:44.800 --> 02:57:50.400
people to my work the less easy it is to be a recluse yes indeed uh professor Carl Frister

02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:56.400
that's been an absolute honor thank you so much for joining us thank you thank you very much okay

02:57:56.400 --> 02:58:00.960
this is just a bit of a note from me at the end of the podcast thank you so much for supporting

02:58:00.960 --> 02:58:06.560
all the stuff that we're doing it means so much to me um we have a patreon if you would like to

02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:11.840
support us personally if you're touched by the work that we do um also I'd really appreciate it

02:58:11.840 --> 02:58:17.760
if you could give us a rating on your podcast app um I actually discovered the other day I couldn't

02:58:17.760 --> 02:58:24.720
quite believe this but on Spotify we are the top rated AI podcast for active AI podcast um yeah it's

02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:30.400
incredible so thank you so much for those of you who have rated us um unfortunately on apple

02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:36.160
podcast the learning rate is only 0.01 so it hasn't quite caught up uh with the fact that we're the

02:58:36.160 --> 02:58:41.520
best AI podcast yet so particularly on on apple podcast if you could give us a five star rating

02:58:41.520 --> 02:58:47.920
and and a review I think that will accelerate the learning process um yeah other than that if you're

02:58:47.920 --> 02:58:54.080
on youtube most of you aren't subscribed um of course youtube has recently changed its modus operandi

02:58:54.080 --> 02:58:59.040
it's less of a subscription chronological model and it's more of a magical algorithm model so I

02:58:59.040 --> 02:59:03.520
guess it doesn't matter so much but just from a just from a metrics point of view it would really

02:59:03.520 --> 02:59:08.800
help us out if you hit the subscribe button uh we have an active discord community as well

02:59:08.800 --> 02:59:13.360
so check us out on there and yeah I just wanted to say one more time thank you so much for all

02:59:13.360 --> 02:59:18.560
of your support it means so much to us and uh plenty more content like this coming your way soon

02:59:19.440 --> 02:59:22.880
cheers see you on the next one
