1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
and I should look into your eyes.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,320
A bit of a bit of a combo.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,680
So yeah, like that camera vaguely in my direction.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,120
I don't think it matters.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,880
OK, just don't look down.

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,600
OK, don't look down because of the glasses and the light.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,600
Oh, yeah, let me check that.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,840
Tiny bit sort of, but when I say source,

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,360
the only light source.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,120
So I'm director of product for R&D Adversus.

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,560
And I'm also a student in PhD for cognitive computing

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,560
at the University of Quebec in Montreal.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,760
Fantastic.

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,000
So what have we just been discussing?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,760
God, we've been discussing a lot of things.

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,960
I think we discussed panpsychism most recently.

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,720
We discussed computationalism.

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,080
We discussed whether we should be focused on materiality

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,400
or whether it's about the processes themselves,

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,360
the hard problem, IIT, lots of things, lots of things.

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,880
Yeah, so why don't we start with the beginning?

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,480
So that's quite a good segue, actually.

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,880
So recently there was this letter of opposition

24
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,600
around integrated information theory.

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,960
What's your take on that?

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,360
I think the reaction was to be expected.

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,840
I think you can't ask people that aren't

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,840
involved in a process which is aimed at determining

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,520
whether they are right or wrong just to accept

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,520
the outcomes of something in which they had no say.

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,120
So there's that.

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,440
It's like saying, well, you're going

33
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,560
to have to accept the outcome of elections, but you can't vote.

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,440
I think one of the issues is the people who created the study

35
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,520
determined a process that left too much room, too much wiggle

36
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,560
room for interpretation and critique,

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,400
which means there's a problem in the study design

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,320
to begin with.

39
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,720
I think when you start attacking through adversarial means

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,720
a field, it is highly likely the field is going to retaliate.

41
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,880
So this open letter, I think, was a retaliatory move.

42
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,040
I think it was a very strong response

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,840
to perhaps coverage that should have been more nuanced.

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,960
I definitely don't think IIT is the leading

45
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,520
consciousness theory.

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,960
I think it's an interesting one.

47
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,160
I think it has promise.

48
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,400
I think it's definitely formal.

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,880
There are many others.

50
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,080
I think this one was just one of the ones that was selected

51
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,560
in the Templeton study.

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,680
And so I think we need to be more careful about how we comport

53
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,040
ourselves towards other scientists.

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,280
When we call an entire field pseudoscience,

55
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,920
I don't think it helps.

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,440
I think we can critique the parts of the field

57
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,640
we think are egregious or problematic.

58
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,040
I think that's helpful because it builds towards something

59
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,560
rather than just destroying something for which a lot of people

60
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,640
have given their lives.

61
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,040
Not through death, but they've given a lot of their time.

62
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,040
They've studied.

63
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,040
They've understood what would constitute the right kind

64
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,840
of methodology, and they've applied it.

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,680
So I don't think we can just disqualify it

66
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,560
as something that has no value offhand.

67
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,720
Now, it's not to say that they necessarily all

68
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,280
had an offhand opinion, but the way it was presented

69
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,240
basically suggested because of tabloid style reporting,

70
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,600
we're leaning towards something dangerous,

71
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,800
and to do so, they used tabloid-styled methods.

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,840
That's my take.

73
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,360
Do you think there is any bright line between what

74
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,840
is legitimate science and what isn't?

75
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,680
I think there might be, but I don't think

76
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,360
it's where people think it is.

77
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,400
I think, for instance, some people called science something

78
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,760
that used tools.

79
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,800
And I think, to me, that's insufficient to qualify as science.

80
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,640
So it's not because you use a little pinny machine

81
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,760
to go like this on somebody's head,

82
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,160
that phrenology is effectively a science.

83
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,280
That's not.

84
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,640
I think you need to measure invariance

85
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,160
and measure how those invariance allow you

86
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,680
some degree of predictability.

87
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,840
To me, that's the essence of science.

88
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,560
But I also think that some things that people

89
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,640
can discard as evidence still can qualify as evidence.

90
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,800
To me, phenomenology can become a part of evidence.

91
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,480
To me, intersectional data, which

92
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,320
means it's not necessarily data that will easily reproduce,

93
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,600
can qualify as data under the caveats,

94
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,800
that it is not something that would reproduce,

95
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,680
that it is something that is specific to a perspective

96
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,440
and therefore cannot qualify as a generalizer.

97
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,000
I think a lot of qualitative methods

98
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,280
have developed entire frameworks to explain how

99
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,280
to interpret what they measured as data.

100
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,360
And oftentimes, because people in the STEM fields

101
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,960
are not aware of how this interpretation is

102
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,200
meant to be taken, they just see something which

103
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,520
doesn't seem very systematic.

104
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,080
And they're like, well, that's not data.

105
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,440
I was like, well, OK, to your measurement,

106
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,480
that's not data.

107
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,200
Because there is no way for what you're

108
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,880
using to interpret that in any sort of systematized way.

109
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
Sure.

110
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,880
But for someone who understands how to generate that data,

111
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,160
how to potentially return to the space which

112
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,160
has similar partitions, and how to turn this

113
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,160
into something which becomes a little more systematic,

114
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,560
like thematic analysis.

115
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,960
And let's say, interjudge agreement.

116
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,000
Then we get to something that resembles systematicity,

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,600
and therefore we can derive patterns from there.

118
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,720
So I think the line is not as bright as people would like

119
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,680
to think, but it does exist.

120
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
Yeah, I like your notion of systematicity.

121
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,640
Because I suppose you could just argue

122
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,160
on some kind of just basic utility.

123
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,800
You mentioned phrenology.

124
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,120
And there was this horrific gaydar paper a few years ago.

125
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't know if you remember, where they ingested

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,680
a whole bunch of images from dating websites.

127
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,000
And they trained it to predict whether you were gay or not.

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,200
And it was from Stanford.

129
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,600
And the same Stanford researcher recently

130
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,520
published a paper about theory of mind and language models.

131
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,880
That's an interesting aside.

132
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,560
But anyway, that's something which is ethically ridiculous.

133
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,120
And there are all sorts of confounding factors and so on.

134
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,600
But they might argue, well, this is science

135
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,080
because it has predictive power.

136
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,520
Well, what part of it was science?

137
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,320
Like, what model did it allow us?

138
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,960
What understanding did it allow us?

139
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,640
Did the AI have predictive power, or did we?

140
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,680
And under what circumstances?

141
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,400
Like, did it predict very accurately

142
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,680
whether someone was gay or not?

143
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,280
I don't know.

144
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,400
But you could tell me whether, yes, it did or not.

145
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,280
But what does that tell us about the world?

146
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,320
Does it tell us that there's a context under which certain sets

147
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,800
of features are common for a given population?

148
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,240
Possibly, but I still don't know what those features are.

149
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,960
It didn't really help me.

150
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,840
And then the idea that we can turn certain kinds of studies

151
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,600
in practice, I think, is not beyond the scope of science.

152
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,520
That's not really it.

153
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,920
But I think it requires the scientists

154
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,800
to take a stance before the scientific experiment

155
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,600
to say, these are the outcomes I believe

156
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,600
should be put out into the world.

157
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,880
And therefore, this is what I choose to reify with my science.

158
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,920
And also, the kinds of methods I'm

159
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,800
going to use are themselves anchored

160
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,920
in some kind of contextuality, right?

161
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,960
Like, the idea of breaking apart the world

162
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,200
into certain kinds of categories which are laden.

163
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,800
And I'm going to measure those categories

164
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,000
with certain kinds of things, like IQ tests.

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,280
It's quite controversial, right?

166
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,800
It's like, do they measure intelligence?

167
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,040
Or do they measure a certain kind of aptitude

168
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,680
given a certain kind of context?

169
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,920
Like, maybe?

170
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,600
And also, what do we mean when we say intelligence?

171
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,160
Like, are we saying some people, therefore, are not,

172
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,440
and therefore, X, Y, Z?

173
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,760
So I think that doesn't make it phrenology, though.

174
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,040
That still could become science.

175
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,080
And in the case of the AI model,

176
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,120
if it had accuracy given that, it probably did.

177
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,160
But I don't think that tells me anything about a causal factor

178
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,360
that I could then derive and build upon, right?

179
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,680
Like, it doesn't really help.

180
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,720
Yeah, no, it's interesting.

181
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,880
I mean, the whole endeavor of science

182
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,920
is something that fascinates me.

183
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,240
And once you get past the question, of course, of, you know,

184
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,160
well, what makes good science?

185
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,400
Chomsky, by the way, says that language models are not

186
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,360
the theory of language, because they basically, you know,

187
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,720
they can recognize anything.

188
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,640
You can just put noise into a language model

189
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
and it will recognize it.

190
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,000
So it doesn't really say anything about the why

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,840
and the what would happen if not question.

192
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,080
It just, you know, it just models absolutely everything.

193
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,760
So science needs to kind of create clear dividing lines

194
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,040
between what things are and what things are not

195
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,000
and why they happen.

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,800
Yeah, so I think I just think we have to be careful when we say

197
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,440
what things are and what things are not.

198
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,880
I think it's always relative to something else.

199
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,720
Like, I think it's true that you can put language

200
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,160
in a language model and it will do something.

201
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,840
But will it do what you wanted it to do?

202
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,960
I'm not sure.

203
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,960
So in the case of Chomsky, I don't think he's wrong.

204
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,960
I just think that in general, what we mean by language,

205
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,680
we don't just mean a way to transmit

206
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,160
semantics, I think we mean a way to transmit semantics

207
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,000
which are anchored into something for which we expect

208
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
a certain kind of outcome to also follow.

209
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,400
Because if both you and I mean blue butterfly,

210
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,400
but we don't mean the same like referent,

211
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,080
then it's useless.

212
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,920
That's not really language.

213
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,920
We're not really like converging over anything.

214
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,800
So I think that's the thing.

215
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,000
Like the language models don't necessarily converge with us

216
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,160
where we want them to converge.

217
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,360
So in that sense, they're disconnected,

218
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,840
but they do, to me and you, carry some semantics.

219
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,680
And that's how we can tell that like,

220
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,840
they're not doing what we thought they were gonna do there.

221
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,080
They can get disaligned with us.

222
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,280
So yeah, so again, things that they,

223
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,080
what things are and what things are not

224
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,880
is always relative to what we're doing.

225
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,080
What we're not is always relative

226
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,760
to some kind of perspective that frames it

227
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,900
and constrains it for it to be at all.

228
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,080
Yeah, I mean, because obviously we can get to the question

229
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,960
of whether you think language is a system of thought

230
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,640
or a system of communication.

231
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,920
But I kind of agree with what you're saying

232
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,520
about language models, which is that essentially

233
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,560
they are spitting out words, which means something to us.

234
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,240
And we can discuss where that intrinsic meaning comes from

235
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,000
whether it's pragmatics or whether it's just

236
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,440
some kind of colloquial usage of the word or whatever.

237
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,040
I mean, what's your take on the first question,

238
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,160
which is, do you think language evolved

239
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,280
as a communication or thinking mechanism?

240
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,120
I think we're baking in the definition

241
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,200
when we ask for either like, is language something

242
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,720
that is simply a reference between some kind of cluster

243
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,440
and some kind of real thing, is that language

244
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,640
or does it have to be something which is externalized

245
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,640
as a symbol, in which case, then it's purely communication?

246
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,080
So whether I think we have to be more clear

247
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,200
about what we mean, because I do think

248
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,360
that you don't need to externalize what you understood

249
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,960
in order to cluster it.

250
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,240
It's better, it allows you to confirm and act on it.

251
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,000
And especially if there are more agents around you,

252
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,760
I think it makes thinking much more efficient.

253
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,480
So I think if we went all the way down,

254
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,680
I think we'd find that maybe the egg or chicken problem,

255
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,440
like we could solve it sort of,

256
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,880
I think at the layers at which we would recognize something

257
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,760
that resembles thought or resembles language,

258
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,200
they're no longer separate.

259
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,600
But if we cast language as a system of reference

260
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,600
and reference, then I don't think you need communication

261
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,800
for that, you just need one entity to recognize something

262
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,800
and be able to keep that as something

263
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,320
it can refer back to later.

264
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,080
So it it towards itself,

265
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,840
but that also could be qualified as communication,

266
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,920
communication over time with yourself, right?

267
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,560
You cash something out,

268
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,920
which you will pull back again afterwards.

269
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,120
So whether it's spatial or temporal or spatiotemporal,

270
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,960
I think, is the real question we're asking here.

271
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,080
Okay, okay, interesting.

272
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,800
But I think that you can embed thinking inside language.

273
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,600
I mean, for example, like if you're writing software,

274
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,480
there are design patterns

275
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,960
and there are patterns for doing lots of different things

276
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,240
and we give them names

277
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,760
and then the developers recognize those patterns

278
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,080
in the software and they say, oh, I understand now.

279
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,040
And loads and loads of these thinking primitives,

280
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,280
I think are kind of culturally embedded in our language

281
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,200
and they're like memes

282
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,600
and they get passed through generation

283
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,360
and we just point to those things

284
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,720
and then we link them

285
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,960
to those kind of cognitive programs that we have.

286
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,640
The fidelity of that mapping, of course,

287
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,000
whether it's mediated or whether it's a simulacrum,

288
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,240
we can discuss that.

289
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,440
Okay, I don't disagree.

290
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,960
Yeah, I think you're right.

291
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,600
I think you tapped into this idea of whether

292
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,240
this is thought or does it require a name?

293
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,640
Would the pattern exist without the name

294
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,000
and would it be referable without the name?

295
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,520
Could we still point to it?

296
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,520
And then if we think of sign language,

297
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,800
what qualifies as a symbol in sign language

298
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,040
is it a reliable action

299
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,680
that follows something else?

300
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,400
Is it this intermediate?

301
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,680
And in this case, what qualifies as an intermediate

302
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,120
or intermediary when you're pointing at something?

303
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,800
So is it the fact that I look at you, you look at me,

304
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,280
I know you're waiting for something,

305
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,560
so I'm gonna point to the thing

306
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,120
and you're gonna make that connection as well.

307
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,320
Is that language?

308
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,480
I would argue, yeah, it is language.

309
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,560
And that's why I think animals, to some extent,

310
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,040
a lot of them have language.

311
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,360
If they're capable of transmitting information

312
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,280
through themselves as intermediaries.

313
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,400
And again, do you do this with yourself

314
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,080
without having to use what we would qualify as words?

315
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,720
I think words are just reliable intermediate clusters

316
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,920
and whatever those are.

317
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,240
Yeah, no, I completely agree.

318
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,000
So yeah, first of all, I think when we say language,

319
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,840
people assume that we're talking about words.

320
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,240
And as you rightly said,

321
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,080
just imagine a hypothetical situation,

322
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,400
you were born unable to make any sounds,

323
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,720
you didn't have a mouth

324
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,480
and you could only write with a pen.

325
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,880
You would still be every bit as capable as any other human

326
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,120
or perhaps you could only use sign language.

327
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,760
And then you could say, well,

328
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,720
does sign language have the representation

329
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,480
or fidelity or cardinality of language?

330
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,040
Yes, it does, absolutely it does.

331
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,880
So language isn't so much about the cardinality of,

332
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,480
I mean, language is just basically a set of strings,

333
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,080
by the way, so how much can you represent?

334
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,000
But anyway, I think it's about

335
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,440
kind of social complexification in our brains.

336
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,120
And even the ability to write

337
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,560
is quite an interesting example of that.

338
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,840
So this is a proto-ability that we've learned

339
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,120
and you mentioned animals and animals don't have the ability

340
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,600
to, you know, they don't have the flexibility that we have.

341
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,400
So they don't have the ability to map symbols

342
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,280
to a variety of different phenomena.

343
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,040
They do map some symbols to phenomena,

344
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,200
but that seems to be much more hardwired.

345
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,760
Whereas with humans, it's very, very flexible.

346
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,800
And it's a real mystery and unfortunately,

347
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,880
we don't have the phylogenetic record,

348
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,960
the intermediate record of how and why

349
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,920
that capability developed, but it did develop in humans.

350
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,480
So I can't speak as to why it develops

351
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,280
in humans and not in animals.

352
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,640
I think what we can talk about is

353
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,520
what qualifies something as a language

354
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,760
if it's not the words, the sounds, the writing

355
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,160
or the signs, I think we're talking about a process

356
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,440
which is it's degree of rigidity on a certain scale.

357
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,640
So when you and I use words,

358
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,680
there's a very high likelihood that we refer to

359
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,160
some similar abstractness that can be contained, right?

360
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,960
Under some kind of market blanket.

361
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Whereas the porosity of me kind of pointing over there,

362
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,560
that could mean a lot of things.

363
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,400
Like I haven't really reduced entropy.

364
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,320
Like given a context, there's a possibility

365
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,720
that we would reduce it, right?

366
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,640
And that's precisely the sociality you're talking about.

367
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,040
We're talking about these scripts

368
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,320
that basically constrain, constrain, constrain, constrain.

369
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,600
And then within those constraints,

370
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,480
there are a lot of different kinds of signals

371
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,960
that have come to take on a reliable meaning.

372
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,000
And we're so expressive

373
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,760
because we have so many of these symbols

374
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,080
and we can compose them.

375
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,360
So there's different scales, right?

376
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,680
So if I say the word trout,

377
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,320
I'm not sure you know what I mean here.

378
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,480
Like why trout?

379
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,400
What are you trying to say?

380
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,520
But if I add more words,

381
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,200
then suddenly I've also added more context to trout.

382
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,320
So I've contained, constrained

383
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,760
and now suddenly scales of meaning arise.

384
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,280
We have more priors, more priors

385
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,040
and now trout takes on a whole other meaning.

386
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,800
But if I kept pointing,

387
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,880
I don't think there'd be lots of information

388
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,080
that's contained here until maybe I do the thing for you

389
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,520
and now you'll know maybe that if I point over there,

390
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,720
that's what I mean.

391
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,480
Yeah, yeah, fascinating.

392
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,280
You mentioned intelligence before, by the way.

393
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,000
So what's your take on intelligence?

394
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,200
To me, intelligence doesn't start

395
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,520
as fundamentally human, right?

396
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,400
So we start for that.

397
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,080
Like to me, intelligence is a type of process.

398
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,120
It's the capacity to derive as many paths

399
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,200
between two points as possible.

400
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,360
Because it entails that you can compute those paths, right?

401
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,260
So your capacity to compute them is one thing.

402
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,120
And the precision with which you'll be able

403
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,960
to reach the point, right?

404
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,840
You could think you're computing the paths,

405
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,160
but you could be wrong.

406
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,240
You could actually get to a way different point.

407
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,040
So I don't think that would qualify as intelligence.

408
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,520
Intelligence is both your capacity

409
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,480
to reach accurately the point,

410
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,040
but also to reach it through a variety of means

411
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,320
that you can entertain at a given time.

412
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,680
So on that, and we'll talk about goals in a minute,

413
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,560
but let's say a goal is an end state.

414
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,960
So there's a state action space

415
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,040
and we're traversing through the space.

416
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,520
And then we look at the cone pattern of traversal

417
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,960
and the shape of that cone tells us a lot about intelligence.

418
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,040
So the cone might incorporate future affordances

419
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,360
which are not yet available to us.

420
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,240
They might include, maybe there's some kind of a cost function

421
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,960
because some affordances are harder to take than others,

422
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,120
both because of physical difficulty

423
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,120
and intellectual difficulty.

424
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,200
So you're saying there's some kind of utility function

425
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,880
that we can sum over all of those trajectories

426
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,560
to tell us how intelligent we are.

427
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,720
Yeah, I think so.

428
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,040
I think it's not necessarily also your capacity

429
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,360
to enact them, right?

430
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,560
I think, because if it was your capacity to enact them,

431
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,840
anybody disempowered would not be very intelligent

432
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,800
and that's not true.

433
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,760
That's not true.

434
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,320
They could compute it and be like,

435
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,480
well, I mean, I can see that if I were in that position

436
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,080
I would be able to or I can see that this is a path

437
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,600
that exists, but there's something in the way.

438
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,440
Like I can't go there.

439
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,080
That path exists nonetheless.

440
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,160
Like I know I can go outside right now

441
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,840
but all the doors are closed.

442
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,840
So I know I could try to find a way to open the door

443
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,320
but eventually the cost for me to get outside

444
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,560
would be so high I would effectively dissolve

445
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,720
so there's no point.

446
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,080
So I might as well just not do it.

447
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,200
The likelihood of me actually taking that path

448
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,840
is really low because I'm disempowered.

449
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,960
I'm not less intelligent.

450
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,200
I found a way.

451
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,640
I found a highly improbable way.

452
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,840
I just don't think I should do it.

453
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,840
So I think intelligence generally correlates

454
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,080
with your capacity to reach those goals

455
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,040
and therefore accrue more resources

456
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,760
because you'll be able to find ways to get towards places

457
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,560
which are self-evidencing.

458
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,680
And that also has a self-reinforcing cycle

459
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,000
where the more likely you are to accrue to resources,

460
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,800
the more likely you are to find more paths

461
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,480
that lead you to more goals, et cetera.

462
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,240
And then maybe if you can stop thinking

463
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,200
about the lower level paths you have to take

464
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,800
then you could compute larger scales

465
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,000
and you can become more effective on a, again,

466
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,080
grander scale so you can start influencing more people.

467
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,200
You can start thinking in terms of longer time depth

468
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,880
whereas if you're constantly trying to survive,

469
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,560
like everything's constantly hitting you from everywhere

470
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,360
then you have to compute all the paths

471
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,840
to avoid all those things.

472
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,560
So again, privilege plays into the degree to which

473
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,680
your intellect can expand, right?

474
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,880
Or at least expand in terms of empowerment.

475
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,200
But that's not to say you're not intelligence.

476
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,040
It just means that your intelligence

477
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,320
gets carried and echoed in the world.

478
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,760
And then there's all the social stuff, right?

479
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Because you and I are constrained by socialness

480
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,640
or by some degree of social scripts, we can compute more.

481
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,320
We don't have to wonder how we should use that table.

482
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,280
We don't have to wonder how I should use this mic.

483
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,120
I know.

484
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,080
So the more we have these,

485
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,240
should you hold me to stop or?

486
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,080
Carry on.

487
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,880
The more we have these social signals

488
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,720
that allow us to compute more,

489
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,800
the more we can think on larger scales

490
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,920
or deeper time depth.

491
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,520
But sometimes I also think that some degree of constraints

492
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,680
also sometimes preclude you from thinking

493
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,840
that a potential path is probable.

494
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,240
Yeah, yeah, I mean, there's a few things there.

495
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,160
I mean, first of all, I quite like this idea

496
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,160
that the length of the prediction horizon

497
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,440
is a good indication of intelligence.

498
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,040
But the only way that we can increase the prediction horizon

499
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,440
is through creating very low resolution abstractions

500
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,400
to represent our sense world.

501
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,160
So that has a kind of brittleness associated with it.

502
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,320
You said something interesting before,

503
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,840
which is that you could think of it

504
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,320
almost as overcoming adversity or overcoming cost,

505
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,400
which like so some trajectories are going against the grain,

506
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,240
but some choose to pursue those trajectories.

507
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,200
And therefore you can think of them as more intelligent.

508
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,160
Yeah, so it's quite interesting.

509
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,480
I mean, I also like to zoom out

510
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,280
and think of the actual goals themselves.

511
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:27,000
Now, first of all, I think that goals are a system property.

512
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,240
I don't think individual agents have goals.

513
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,520
So I'm not sure it makes sense for an agent

514
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,360
to pursue a goal, but let's just as a best faith argument,

515
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,680
take a goal as a future state,

516
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,120
which an agent is aware of.

517
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,600
I would also factor in the utility of those goals

518
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,920
and the selection of those goals

519
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,640
as being parts of intelligence.

520
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,360
Yeah, so again, I mean, you said something interesting.

521
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,560
It's a property of the system.

522
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,120
And I think if we take what I said at faith,

523
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,720
intelligence is a property of the system,

524
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,320
not just the individual, right?

525
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,200
Because again, you get carried

526
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,720
given that the system props you somehow

527
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,760
and gives you capacities to think farther.

528
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,080
So given that you and I are in the same system

529
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,200
and have the same relationship to the system,

530
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,160
we could quantify or intellect,

531
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,760
given how far mine would go relative to yours.

532
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,600
But that's only given that we have the same relationship

533
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,800
to the system, which is again, highly unlikely.

534
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,480
You would have to basically be a twin

535
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,200
with practically in similar life

536
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,400
to have the same relationship to the system.

537
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,800
And then again, I mean, this idea of goal with utility,

538
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,000
it's always relative to a scale, right?

539
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,240
So given this scale, there's this gate,

540
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,560
which is highly likely and this gate,

541
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,920
which is slightly likely.

542
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,240
And so I'm probably gonna go from here to here

543
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,880
and how I get from here to here is the real question

544
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,000
and the degree to which I minimize free energy

545
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,920
by going from point to point and improve my model also

546
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,040
by going from point to point,

547
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,000
which is gonna allow me to reach the next goal

548
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,600
without too much energy.

549
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,200
So I don't think that someone taking a path

550
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,520
against the grain is necessarily more,

551
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,280
means that they're more intelligent.

552
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,800
I think that if they can take an unlikely path,

553
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,800
which also allows them to reach a goal

554
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,320
that others would have wanted to reach

555
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,560
and maybe couldn't or would do so

556
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,680
with having to spend more energy at a given scale,

557
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,180
means they're probably more intelligent.

558
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,800
But it doesn't mean that if you follow the path,

559
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,960
you're not more intelligent.

560
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,760
Maybe this is the smoothest ride.

561
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,960
Maybe there's no point in doing something different.

562
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,560
Maybe to you, the goal is that simple.

563
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,600
So you took the smoothest ride, that's very smart.

564
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,280
You just also were able to compute many other paths

565
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,760
to go there, you know?

566
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,520
Yeah, but I think a goal in,

567
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,320
because we were talking earlier about complex categories

568
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,800
like a chair, it's very, very difficult to define a chair,

569
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,800
and using the affordance is the way

570
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,960
that most ontologists use.

571
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,080
It's a thing you sit on or whatever.

572
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,080
And a goal, we're not actually talking about a state,

573
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,200
because if we represent the world in this systematic way

574
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,680
where we discretize everything,

575
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,680
then if you think about it,

576
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,940
there would be an infinitude of goals.

577
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,760
So we come up with an abstract notion of a goal,

578
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,080
and now we've just got this big goal thing

579
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,620
that we want to get to.

580
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,960
And still there's an infinite number of trajectories

581
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,680
that would reach an estate

582
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,640
which satisfied that goal.

583
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,960
So it just, it feels, I don't know,

584
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,360
it feels kind of vague to me.

585
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,360
To say goal?

586
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,360
Yeah, well, I guess like,

587
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,240
because we were talking earlier about science

588
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,320
and the benefit of science,

589
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,880
and I think like, you know,

590
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,600
abduction is a key part of science,

591
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,640
and abduction is about finding a reasonable explanation.

592
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,280
So, you know, selecting out of the infinite set

593
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,880
of hypotheses a reasonable set and mapping to them.

594
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,280
And it's a similar thing with a goal, right?

595
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,360
So what you're actually doing is you're,

596
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,320
it's very creative.

597
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,360
You're basically creating something from nothing.

598
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,000
And you're saying, these three things

599
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,640
seem very valuable to me.

600
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,100
Now we know that we're talking about a multi-agent system.

601
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,360
And the intelligence,

602
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,440
and what you said really resonated with me,

603
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,600
the intelligence arises at the system level.

604
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,760
So the individual agent,

605
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,000
I think the goals are not arbitrary,

606
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,160
but not a million miles from arbitrary.

607
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,920
But when you multiply that with many, many agents

608
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,640
and a large collective intelligence,

609
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,440
and you kind of average over the top,

610
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,760
then you get these emergent goals

611
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,320
and you get intelligent behavior.

612
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,000
But it doesn't make sense to me to think of an individual agent

613
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,560
as having any meaningful form of planning and reasoning.

614
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,440
Well, I guess we're putting a lot in meaningful here,

615
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,920
but as a thought experiment,

616
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,920
I like to think of someone really, really, really smart

617
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,160
who would compute like 3,000 years into the future.

618
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,320
And you would think, like, well,

619
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,600
that person would try, you know, solve world hunger

620
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,360
and they would like, I don't know,

621
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,880
they wouldn't try to take over the government.

622
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,560
And, you know, they would find the path

623
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,200
that makes sure that somehow they reach immortality

624
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,960
and their children and something like that.

625
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,360
And I'm like, I don't think so.

626
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,680
I think someone really, really, really intelligent

627
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,320
would probably be able to compute all the paths

628
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,720
and find that they're already on the free energy

629
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,200
minimization path and they would just, you know,

630
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,240
live a very normal life.

631
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,160
Like they would live the life they seem to have been set on

632
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,320
and they would continue in that

633
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,400
because they're part of a manifold

634
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,160
and they're already part of a pool of negentropy

635
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:07,880
and they're already like minimizing somehow.

636
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,600
As Friston says, he argues there's something fundamental

637
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,200
about, you know, if we talk about utility,

638
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,280
for him, utility is existence.

639
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,760
And there is an argument that some things

640
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,960
are so fundamental, so platonic that they go about saying.

641
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,840
So maybe it's existence.

642
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,320
I'm not so sure about that.

643
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,880
I still think that inside Friston's framework,

644
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,680
there are still many potential ways to act and live.

645
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,120
And the ex-risk people, they say,

646
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,040
oh, obviously these agents are going to seek

647
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,000
to maximize power.

648
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,680
And well, why is it obviously?

649
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm not entirely sure.

650
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,360
The agents as in the AIs?

651
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,400
Yeah, the AIs.

652
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,560
First of all, it's interesting that we're saying plural, right?

653
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,120
Like in general, the...

654
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,080
Well, for them actually, it's the one, right?

655
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,360
They're still at the AI stage of there being one.

656
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,200
Yeah, right?

657
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,040
I know, it's so typical.

658
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:06,880
That's only because they haven't got to the multi-scale yet.

659
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,280
No, I know, but I think it speaks to something.

660
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,080
It speaks to this notion of individuality

661
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,400
and disconnection from the others.

662
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,440
Whereas, no, intelligence is a function of your group,

663
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,440
not just of yourself.

664
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,000
The genius myth is a myth.

665
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,480
They all collaborate and prosociality

666
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,560
leads to something better.

667
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,120
So I do think that should AIs take over,

668
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,040
it won't be one, it'll be several,

669
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,800
it'll be a group, like coalition or something.

670
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,520
I'm interested in exploring various limiting factors

671
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,920
or scaling laws for intelligence.

672
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,360
And one of the big ones is knowing.

673
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,760
And in a certain environment,

674
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,960
there are only a finite number of things to know.

675
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,280
And what you know might be related to the agents

676
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,520
that you cohabit your environment with.

677
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,800
But you did say earlier when we were having a discussion

678
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,720
that you thought in principle

679
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,480
that you could scale intelligence.

680
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,200
And I actually like to rephrase what you just said.

681
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,080
So you said when you zoom out

682
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,680
and you're looking not at individual trajectory volumes,

683
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,520
but you're looking at kind of like the adaptability

684
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,880
of the entire super organism.

685
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,680
Because that jives with the common definition

686
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,200
of intelligence that is about adaptation, efficiency.

687
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,240
And I really like that.

688
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
But I guess I still want to say though

689
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,520
that the X-Risk people think that there's a pure intelligence.

690
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,000
So it's pure reason.

691
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,120
It's not in any way constrained by material reality

692
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,560
or like what we know.

693
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,440
And I think, well, let's look at an ecosystem.

694
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,440
And even if the agents had a perfect model of each other,

695
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,080
and so there was a lot of complexification

696
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,400
of the models of every single agent,

697
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,520
surely there's a hard limit

698
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,880
of how many time steps they could predict ahead.

699
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,720
If that intelligence is pure,

700
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,320
like not limited by materiality,

701
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,480
like say it's not,

702
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,080
it doesn't relate to land hours principle.

703
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,800
It's not bound by quantum physics.

704
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,480
Like is that what you mean?

705
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,240
Well, let's say it were possible for an agent

706
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,840
in a collective to predict many, many, many, many steps ahead.

707
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,080
In order for that to happen,

708
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,000
the agent would essentially need

709
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,880
to have an internal simulation of the entire system.

710
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,280
And maybe not the entire system

711
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,080
because we're speaking about mediation and interfaces

712
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,240
and affordances and so on.

713
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,200
So there's still a lot of information hiding there.

714
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,280
But let's say the agent had some holistic understanding

715
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,400
of the entire system

716
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,160
and could roll trajectories far into the future.

717
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,440
So, but I guess my point though is that

718
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,320
the agent wouldn't be intelligent.

719
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,360
It would have memorized everything there is

720
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,960
and know about that ecosystem.

721
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,800
I don't think this time limit thing,

722
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,680
I think you would just lose granularity.

723
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,840
I think we have hierarchical models

724
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,040
and if you extend this to infinity,

725
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:06,040
there's a really sort of high level,

726
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,000
practically near infinity state,

727
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,520
which you can predict, right?

728
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,480
There are constants to the universe.

729
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,160
And so, while I can't tell what you're gonna be doing

730
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,280
in 10 years with precision,

731
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,640
I know there's a day you're gonna die.

732
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,040
Like there's some constants that I can predict.

733
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,520
You know, I know that likes it's gonna keep traveling

734
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,160
until it no longer, you know,

735
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,720
like there's a degree of granularity

736
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,560
that can maintain accuracy,

737
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,840
even if it loses out on precision.

738
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,720
So that's probably one of the solutions.

739
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,800
You would start losing out on granularity.

740
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,000
So if you're asking me,

741
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,480
can you continue predicting with the same level

742
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,340
of both precision and accuracy across infinite time steps?

743
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,660
I think if you're stable enough, yeah.

744
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,100
So the question is really about the degree

745
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,640
to which you have volatility in your system, right?

746
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,480
Because if you and I just freeze in time,

747
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,960
I mean, we're freezing time, that's it.

748
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,160
I've predicted you for infinity.

749
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,400
So it's really a degree to which you can,

750
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,960
predict emergence I think relative to volatility.

751
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,040
And I think we'll be able to,

752
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,840
not necessarily that soon, but I think it's coming.

753
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,400
We're gonna be able to predict emergence.

754
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,960
So if we do, if we can predict emergence,

755
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,360
and we can have models that can get to,

756
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,380
let's say minimal description length,

757
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,440
and they can improve their models

758
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,400
such that they could always reach a higher level,

759
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,600
a shorter description length,

760
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,160
then I think we can predict infinity.

761
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,360
I mean, there's a few things on that.

762
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,360
So first of all, I think that when we have ecosystems

763
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,560
of life, there is a degree of irreducible complexity.

764
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,680
And I think there's a kind of power law distribution

765
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,640
where some of it is reducible complexity

766
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,080
and quite regular, and then a lot of it is so chaotic

767
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,920
on the long tail that it's essentially irreducible.

768
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,600
But I do think, what you said is very interesting

769
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,940
about there being certain trade-offs about predictions.

770
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,060
So yes, we could create low-resolution models

771
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,980
that could predict far into the future.

772
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,020
And we were having an interesting conversation

773
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,700
about AlphaGo, because I think what that does

774
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,780
is it's still a high precision.

775
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,700
It's a high-resolution model,

776
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,900
and even in respect of time steps.

777
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,940
But what it does is it's not a robust model.

778
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,060
So it's a point-alistic model.

779
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,420
So what it's saying is like, okay,

780
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,300
well, Go has a structure to it,

781
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,700
because the state space is combinatorially large.

782
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,660
It has a structure to it,

783
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,580
and most of the humans traverse the structure

784
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,340
along these joints, and I'm gonna just fill in the thing

785
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,540
around the structure.

786
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,060
And that's kind of what you're saying.

787
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,220
So I've got this model, which represents trajectories

788
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:54,620
on the structure, there's holes everywhere, right?

789
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,160
No, I mean, I think that's exactly it.

790
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,580
I think you're talking about the degree to which I can predict

791
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,340
like say a black swan, right?

792
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,900
What happens if there's a black swan?

793
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,700
I can't predict that, like that's outside of the bounce.

794
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,700
So there's always a limit to given

795
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,660
a sort of relatively static model, what I can predict,

796
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,660
no matter how good that model is.

797
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,860
Well, we're talking about models that continuously improve.

798
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,860
So if I continue grabbing complexity

799
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,340
and I continue improving, and I think

800
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:35,660
you'd continue rolling out, say, your predictions.

801
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,620
I think you'd, it would become increasingly possible

802
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,580
for you to predict farther and farther ahead,

803
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,740
especially if you have this capacity to predict

804
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,500
something that qualifies as a black swan,

805
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,620
which is just a phase shift, right?

806
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,460
It's a phase shift that you can't see at the scale

807
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,260
at which you're generally operating your predictions.

808
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,100
So...

809
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,180
Are you defining black swan to mean a rare single event

810
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,380
or like a transition to a new regime?

811
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,180
I mean, I think it's the same.

812
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:11,380
I think a rare single event, effectively,

813
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,380
if you do not have the capacity to adapt to it afterwards,

814
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,380
is effectively a new regime.

815
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:25,420
So black swans can either trigger your resilience,

816
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:31,100
but that effectively means you had the capacity

817
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,100
to deal with policies that could take you across.

818
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,180
So while you couldn't predict the event itself,

819
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,860
you had policies that were capable of dealing with it.

820
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,260
And if you can't deal with it,

821
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,180
and you had no policies that could account

822
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,420
for this degree of error, like this is too much.

823
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,820
So I think that's effectively, at that point,

824
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,060
you become in a new regime.

825
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,900
Interesting.

826
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,740
Okay, okay.

827
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,100
Let's move over to general phenomenology

828
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,140
and an activism type stuff.

829
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,220
So the early anactivists,

830
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,700
they thought that agents kind of construct

831
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,300
their own environment

832
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,820
and that they have a phenomenal experience.

833
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,100
We were discussing earlier, like this,

834
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,940
the extent to which the phenomenal component

835
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,580
adds something to an agent.

836
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,580
What's your take on that?

837
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,500
Oh, no, I think it does.

838
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,500
I think it forces the agent

839
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,740
to deal with that information.

840
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,260
Let's say, through a little more constraints,

841
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,860
you can understand something,

842
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:42,980
but it will have very low impact on your behavior

843
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,540
if you don't feel it.

844
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,460
You can have rules about things,

845
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,620
but what if I take away the rules?

846
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,940
Well, there's nothing then.

847
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:59,940
Like we're just understanding doesn't entail anything.

848
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,100
So effectively phenomenology

849
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,660
sort of forces you into some constraints, right?

850
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,260
It's phenomenology only arises

851
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,540
in relation to your self-model.

852
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,740
So what I'm gonna focus on

853
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,380
relates to what I need to focus on,

854
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,060
what will give me more information,

855
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,300
what relates to my utility function,

856
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:29,460
what I, the intensity of what I feel

857
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,540
relates to how closely or how deeply

858
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,220
it affects my internal states.

859
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,340
Like there's a whole set of things like this

860
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,700
that relate to internal external dynamics.

861
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,660
So I do think it adds something.

862
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,540
Effectively, it adds a degree of precision

863
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,620
relative to the policies you're gonna have to take

864
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,380
to maintain, to self-organize.

865
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:55,380
Without these, you just have some sort of blank picture

866
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,660
on which you're not really capable of focusing.

867
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,460
We're really good at this reflexive self-attention

868
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,340
and also knowing what to pay attention to around us

869
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:08,420
and knowing what level of resolution,

870
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,900
how much can we discard?

871
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,500
So for example, we don't need to know

872
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,620
what the title of all of these books are around us

873
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,260
at the moment because it's not relevant.

874
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,740
So we have this great ability to just discard

875
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,040
all relevant information.

876
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,120
But I don't think phenomenology adds anything

877
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,000
to that discussion, which is to say like,

878
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,800
what is it about phenomenology?

879
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,040
What value does it add in of itself

880
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,200
that can't be explained by just the basic agent framework?

881
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,080
Well, the basic agent framework,

882
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,640
does it have a reflexive model of itself?

883
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:45,640
Like is it capable of determining how it functions

884
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,560
and how that functioning relates

885
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,800
to specific elements outside of itself?

886
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,520
Well, that's a great question actually.

887
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,080
So, because we were saying earlier that to be an agent,

888
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,960
you need to have this like reflexive model of yourself.

889
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,760
And in order for that to happen,

890
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,760
you have to be around other agents

891
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,240
because you have to pass information out

892
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,480
and it comes in again.

893
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,480
So, but this self-awareness I think you would argue

894
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,720
only happens when you have a sufficient level

895
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,760
of nesting or complexity.

896
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,680
Sure, yeah, absolutely.

897
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,840
But then how does it emerge there?

898
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,840
So, you add the complexity,

899
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,000
but what is it that makes this reflexive self-model emerge?

900
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:32,360
So, we're trying to suppose right now,

901
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,760
like we're trying to make a self-model emerge.

902
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,080
Like most of the time when you create an agent

903
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,880
that has a self-model, you just endow it with it.

904
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,920
So, if you're asking me how does the self-model emerge?

905
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,320
I think, I mean, I could explain it to you

906
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,240
in terms of like evolutionary demands,

907
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,240
the kinds of systems that we're able to represent

908
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,880
through some kind of tracking mechanism,

909
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,880
their own functioning on top of the functioning itself.

910
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,320
And that through that tracking of their own functioning,

911
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,280
they were able to modulate the precision

912
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,400
on their functioning.

913
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,080
I mean, that's an explanation of how it emerges, right?

914
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,160
On a purely evolutionary stance.

915
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,680
Now, how does that come about?

916
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,560
I'm not sure I can tell you exactly,

917
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,960
but we are suggesting that potentially

918
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,600
a system can track anything, right?

919
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,120
Can track the outside,

920
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,640
can track the inside to some extent.

921
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,560
So, now that it tracks something,

922
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,640
it makes predictions and these predictions

923
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:48,040
are either good or they carry error.

924
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,320
Given that they carry error too often,

925
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,680
it could choose, it has the possibility

926
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,280
to create a new state.

927
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,160
Like just change its model, create a new state space

928
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,800
and that would be structure learning.

929
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,720
And so, the supposition would be

930
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,520
that let's say a system that has as an action,

931
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,200
as a possible action to let's say,

932
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,120
create a bunch of cells over here

933
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
that can track that stuff,

934
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,320
it will survive longer than the system

935
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,040
that doesn't push a bunch of cells over here

936
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,440
that happen to have the capacity

937
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,200
to track what they're doing.

938
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,480
So, we were gonna test this with say,

939
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,920
an agent that does a simple, silly task,

940
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,440
like find this thing over there.

941
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,960
Or now find it, but in a graph that's like 1000 node long.

942
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,960
Are you better at it if you have a self model

943
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,760
or are you worse at it if you have self model?

944
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,480
And we're not gonna give it the self model.

945
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,600
We're gonna try and see if it can,

946
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,800
through an action of modeling anything

947
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,560
or changing anything, it can start modeling

948
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,120
its own processes and see if that allows it

949
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,080
to eventually, through structure learning,

950
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,400
grow into something that has a self model.

951
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,000
Yeah, I mean, I can believe,

952
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,440
because it sounds very principal to me.

953
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,640
So, I can believe that it would emerge

954
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,400
and it would be useful for survival to emerge.

955
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,560
It makes a lot of sense to me.

956
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,200
And also, it reminds me of like,

957
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,800
Daniel Dennett's intentional stance.

958
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,560
So, like whether or not other actors have mental states,

959
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,520
treating them as if they did,

960
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,280
so that you can make better predictions

961
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,520
about what they do.

962
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,760
That's also very, very useful.

963
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,000
But also, this kind of projection can be misleading

964
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,560
because people look at language models

965
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,760
and they say they have a theory of mind

966
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,360
and they're regurgitating things

967
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,960
from the psychology literature and they're saying,

968
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,000
oh, look, let's do this theory of mind test

969
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,160
on a language model.

970
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,840
Oh, it seems to have a theory of mind.

971
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,680
Well, I don't think it does have a theory of mind.

972
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,240
So, like, is it just another form of anthropomorphization?

973
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:49,960
So, that's the thing.

974
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,120
So, when we say it, what do we mean?

975
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,880
And I think it's possible

976
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,400
that in the embedding,

977
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,120
because it encodes something again,

978
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,000
that could be sort of touring complete,

979
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:11,040
there could be something which tracks theory of mind.

980
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,960
But I don't think it,

981
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,280
as in it's having awareness of,

982
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,080
allowing it a causal model of theory of mind

983
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,560
has theory of mind.

984
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,080
That, to me, is different.

985
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,760
So, can it regurgitate information

986
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,640
that would act like theory of mind

987
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,680
and be as accurate a theory of mind?

988
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,520
Pretty sure it would.

989
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,680
Yeah, it's possible with enough data thrown at it.

990
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:36,520
Probably would.

991
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,080
But,

992
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,840
I don't think it would be able

993
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,720
to tweak its own model

994
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,280
such that it can

995
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,200
really identify why and how

996
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,880
or where it has theory of mind.

997
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,480
Like, I don't think it could self-model in that way.

998
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,160
And I don't think it could tweak its own model like that.

999
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,000
Whereas,

1000
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,200
I'm pretty sure I can.

1001
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,040
I'm pretty sure I have the capacity to know

1002
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,080
that's what I'm doing.

1003
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,880
I'm putting that into you.

1004
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,880
And therefore,

1005
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,480
through trying to understand the causal chains

1006
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,560
that lead me to getting theory of mind about you,

1007
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,840
I can maybe change how that manifests

1008
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:34,280
or increment over it or add more precision

1009
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,760
or even transfer it to something else

1010
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,800
to which now I will give some degree of theory of mind

1011
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:44,640
because I've made that conscious tweak in my model.

1012
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,680
Yeah, yeah.

1013
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,400
Okay, we had an interesting discussion earlier

1014
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,040
about mediation.

1015
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,920
So, and it's related to semantics, right?

1016
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,520
So, we understand each other.

1017
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,120
And in this conversation,

1018
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:02,680
let's say we're creating this temporary construction.

1019
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,600
So, we're implementing the mediation pattern.

1020
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,360
And we've selected some categories

1021
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,040
that we kind of agree on the semantics

1022
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,320
and we're kind of like mediating

1023
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,360
through that shared structure.

1024
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,720
And that to me,

1025
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,000
I mean, I guess that's like a kind of bespoke theory of mind,

1026
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,200
which we've just created now.

1027
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,600
The fact that we're capable of mediating through language?

1028
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,160
Yeah, not that well, I mean,

1029
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,960
as we're using language in a very broad term,

1030
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,800
as we said earlier,

1031
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,800
so we're communicating using language,

1032
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:35,520
but we are using a certain vernacular,

1033
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,280
we're talking about certain categories and so on

1034
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,120
that that we agree with.

1035
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,560
But I guess like the reason I'm bringing up mediation

1036
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,680
is perhaps we are communicating

1037
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:48,440
in a slightly adapted way than we naturally would.

1038
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,800
Yeah, so to me, the reason that this allows me to derive

1039
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,280
that we have theory of mind

1040
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,520
is because through this,

1041
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,520
I can sort of push away a specialization to you

1042
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,640
that allows me no longer to compute

1043
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,680
what you're gonna compute

1044
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,440
and still together reach our goal.

1045
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,600
What this means?

1046
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,240
I think you can model me

1047
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,380
and I think I can model you.

1048
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,000
That's it.

1049
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,440
To me, that's the extent of it.

1050
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,240
Like I can put myself in your shoes

1051
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,280
and know what you're gonna do

1052
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,800
and you can put yourself in my shoes

1053
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,840
and know what I'm gonna do.

1054
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,080
And that's just shared pretensions.

1055
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,240
It's shared coordination

1056
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,880
because I've outsourced something to you

1057
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,920
that I think reliably you're going to push

1058
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,360
towards a similar outcome.

1059
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,360
I don't think it's that complicated.

1060
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,160
I think definitely language is one of our main mediums

1061
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,960
through which we understand how we reach that coordination,

1062
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,840
but there's so much more to it, right?

1063
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:54,840
Like institutions embedded material reality,

1064
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,040
physical constraints, phenotype, time.

1065
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:05,040
Like there's so much to these shared flows

1066
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:11,280
that we are part of that we both know how to interact with

1067
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,200
and I know you know how to interact with them

1068
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,400
and how can I recognize that?

1069
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,800
Well, I see you interacting with them.

1070
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,840
I know that were I in your position,

1071
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,880
I would do very much the same thing.

1072
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,920
And I can tell you can tell I'm doing the same thing

1073
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,320
because you put the chair there.

1074
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,040
I'm pretty sure you intended me to sit and talk in that thing.

1075
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,200
You didn't tell me that.

1076
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,040
We understood through the scripts

1077
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,880
that we were able to reliably predict that this happened.

1078
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,880
So that's to me the medium is quite broad,

1079
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,200
but it manifests through its reliability.

1080
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,840
Yes, yeah, interesting.

1081
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,280
And in some sense, our generative models,

1082
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,480
even though they are very, very different,

1083
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,000
there is a significant intersection,

1084
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
although I don't think it makes sense to talk about

1085
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,040
an intersection of the high resolution generative model.

1086
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,280
It's more about the language or not only the language,

1087
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,040
you were talking about the performativity

1088
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,040
of sitting down in a chair

1089
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,240
and like the various things that we do,

1090
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,800
they can create intersections to bridge understanding.

1091
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,640
Absolutely.

1092
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,400
That's why poetry to me is mind-boggling.

1093
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,320
Like poetry to me is precisely those intersections

1094
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,960
which are generally inexistent.

1095
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,800
They're novel.

1096
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,320
Like we're literally creating images

1097
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,600
nobody else has created before, creating connections

1098
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,520
nobody else has created before.

1099
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,040
And yet, or at least it's the hope,

1100
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,280
people understand poetry.

1101
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,280
You have created an entirely new constraint system

1102
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,560
which normally doesn't point to anything.

1103
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,960
And somehow, because there's all these webs

1104
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,880
of other constraints that I can sort of pull from

1105
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,840
in reliable ways, you and I will create

1106
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:01,840
the new series of intersections across all these dimensions

1107
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,240
and we still are capable of communicating

1108
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,520
and coordinating across that.

1109
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,960
To me, that's mind-boggling.

1110
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:10,880
Yeah, yeah.

1111
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,080
And so subjectivity fascinates me

1112
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,480
and poetry we spoke about going to a music festival earlier.

1113
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,640
And at the music festival, the shared experience

1114
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:24,640
is that weird sense of being with other people.

1115
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,320
Clearly not, what does it mean to understand music?

1116
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,600
What does it mean to understand poetry?

1117
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,440
I'm not sure.

1118
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,640
Like it's this moment of, whoop,

1119
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,360
something new is happening here

1120
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,600
and we can both reliably feel there's something new.

1121
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:41,120
And now what we make of that something new,

1122
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,680
I think is why poetry is a terrible way to communicate.

1123
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,880
Like I mean, great, you've made something clever.

1124
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,160
We both felt something, something new here

1125
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,800
and we communicated the fact that we understand this gap

1126
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,720
and there's the possibility for our feeling of this gap

1127
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:00,720
to be similar and if it's, to me, a good poem

1128
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,320
will have reliably similar experiences

1129
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,280
in the sense that some poem means to say something to you,

1130
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,960
not just create an experience.

1131
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,680
Like I was just watching this video on YouTube

1132
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,200
the other day about Rupi Kaur

1133
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,920
and how she with her Insta poetry kind of ruined poetry

1134
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,120
because a lot of her poems are like,

1135
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,480
her poems are like completely like first level.

1136
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,000
They're just, they're just,

1137
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,040
she just said, this is a book and I have a book.

1138
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,040
Like there's nothing there, right?

1139
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,800
But sometimes through the clever ways that her words

1140
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:40,800
mix in a new and powerful, surprising way,

1141
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,840
you will feel this intensity and connect this intensity

1142
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:49,120
with a term you wouldn't have normally.

1143
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,760
And that's a new phenomenology that has given you a meaning.

1144
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,560
You now understand what it's like to be a woman.

1145
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,560
You would never have put that intensity

1146
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,960
on this connection of concepts

1147
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,080
that doesn't mean anything to you.

1148
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,160
It's like there's no valence there.

1149
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,760
And now there is and suddenly you've experienced something

1150
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,720
that she meant to make you experience.

1151
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,840
And so she has communicated what she meant to communicate.

1152
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:20,120
There's very low uncertainty there.

1153
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,160
But when you read a poem by some abstract poet

1154
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:28,160
who says something that, I mean, it's surprising

1155
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,840
but I don't understand what he's trying to say to me.

1156
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,800
I feel like it's not going as far.

1157
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,160
Like, yeah, okay, I felt the surprise

1158
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,600
but now it has no, it doesn't help with my model.

1159
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,000
It doesn't go any deeper.

1160
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,640
And perhaps that poetry is not for me.

1161
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,360
It doesn't give me a new phenomenology

1162
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,320
other than the surprise of the words.

1163
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,400
Yeah, that really resonates with me.

1164
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,880
And I think where I was getting stuck before is,

1165
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,160
I thought, well, and I think of meaning

1166
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,400
and understanding as being quite related.

1167
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:04,480
And you could have a very impactful phenomenal experience

1168
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,600
but I was worried it might stop with you, but it doesn't.

1169
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,360
So as long as the information can propagate, right?

1170
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:14,880
It has this memetic quality to it

1171
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,080
because there is no meaning without grounding

1172
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,760
but everything is grounded.

1173
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,120
So you're reading a poem, you're sitting in this location.

1174
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,880
It's now been grounded to this location.

1175
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:29,640
You now create a yearly pilgrimage

1176
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,920
where you come back to this location with your friends

1177
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,520
and you read the same poem

1178
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,120
and then this memetic energy builds

1179
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,800
and builds and builds.

1180
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,400
So, and maybe it doesn't always work that way

1181
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,040
but I think you can interpret that as still forming meaning.

1182
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,840
No, I agree, but I think I would find interesting

1183
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,200
the thought experiment of,

1184
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,040
because you and I, we exist in this world, right?

1185
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,080
So obviously our meaning is in this world.

1186
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,480
So we can create emergent structures

1187
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,160
but in the end they always bottom out to this world.

1188
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,040
But what if we were, to your point earlier,

1189
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:08,960
entirely systems that only exist in words?

1190
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,920
Like we, it's just words that like through some kind

1191
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,840
of functor becomes other words

1192
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,520
and then connect to other words.

1193
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,080
And it's just like large graph of words to words to words.

1194
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:25,080
And anytime a path through words is enacted,

1195
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,960
it triggers other paths through words.

1196
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,280
I feel like you could have something that resembles

1197
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,880
phenomenology.

1198
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,040
It just wouldn't be this.

1199
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,600
Like there's a possibility for a system

1200
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:48,600
to fully be contained and self-organized

1201
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:54,200
within that so long as its maintenance

1202
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,520
is conditioned upon it having a boundary

1203
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,680
which it has to maintain.

1204
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,280
Otherwise it disappears.

1205
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,360
So I could totally see some kind of simulation

1206
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:10,800
of like graphs that try to stay graphs

1207
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,720
and become so complex that they maintain graphs

1208
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,400
and it wouldn't really relate to their capacity

1209
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:18,520
to exchange bits, right?

1210
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,040
Again, it would have nothing to do

1211
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:22,560
with the physical embodiment of it.

1212
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,600
It's just that I can't conceive of anything

1213
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,240
that wouldn't have a physical embodiment to some degree.

1214
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,240
So, but I don't think that's impossible.

1215
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,440
Before we finish, I'm supposed to ask you about resiliency.

1216
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,520
Collective intelligences, they are grown.

1217
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,080
They're not designed by definition.

1218
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,200
And they have some interesting properties.

1219
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,800
They can kind of heal themselves, repair themselves.

1220
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,200
But there's a lot of complexity.

1221
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,880
We don't understand what they're doing entirely.

1222
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,800
But I guess like it is intuitive to me

1223
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,440
how, I mean, Michael Levin talks about this,

1224
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,320
you know, a collective intelligence is more resilient

1225
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,520
because of self-organization.

1226
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,600
But can you kind of explain from your perspective

1227
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:02,680
like why you think that is?

1228
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,320
Yeah, I mean, exactly why?

1229
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:08,160
Why is self-organization of a group more resilient?

1230
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,720
So we talked about it earlier,

1231
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,000
like how do we define resilience?

1232
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,800
We define resilience as the capacity for a system

1233
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,280
given a perturbation to either remain the same

1234
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:27,800
or live the perturbation and return to what it was before

1235
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:34,080
or learn something new and adapt and become better, right?

1236
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,120
So generally we think of black swans

1237
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,200
as these highly improbable things

1238
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,880
that you kind of, you can't really deal with.

1239
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,040
And so generally what'll happen with a black swan

1240
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,520
is it'll vastly perturb your system.

1241
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,160
And if you have the seed of the system

1242
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,840
and might grow again and return to what it was,

1243
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:00,840
so from that point already, it doesn't have inertia.

1244
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,280
Inertia is like the wind on the cup.

1245
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,240
The cup, the wind is a disruption,

1246
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,440
but it's so, it has such inertia in its policies

1247
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,320
that it's like it's gonna stay a cup.

1248
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,800
Now, a black swan is me grabbing the cup

1249
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,920
and dropping it on the floor.

1250
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,520
It can't deal with that.

1251
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,200
Now, a plastic cup or like say a rubber cup,

1252
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,240
it'll get on the floor, it'll bounce a little,

1253
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,880
it'll deform and it'll come back.

1254
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,760
A smart plastic cup.

1255
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,000
Now that cup will not only, you know, it'll fall,

1256
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,440
it'll learn what happened in the fall

1257
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,160
and it'll be like, what was the cause of the fall?

1258
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,120
Somebody grab me.

1259
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,000
So next time something comes to grab me,

1260
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I'll move a little bit.

1261
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,720
So that would be a plastic system.

1262
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,560
So the reason systems that are groups

1263
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,080
have the capacity for resilience

1264
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:55,760
is because they have the capacity for one,

1265
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,760
creating some core of inertia.

1266
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,600
Something of the group will be maintained.

1267
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,680
Like they have a very strong inside,

1268
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,840
it's very clear about what it is

1269
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,320
and it'll be able to continue pushing

1270
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,800
what it is into the world.

1271
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,120
Then it has like structures that are a bit more,

1272
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:15,280
you know, like elastic.

1273
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,840
They'll take disturbances, but they'll come back

1274
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,160
and they'll be able to do that

1275
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,920
because they can receive again the signal from the inside

1276
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,400
that's like, this is what we are.

1277
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,280
Okay, all right, let's go back.

1278
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,440
And through this, they understand

1279
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,480
that they have predictability,

1280
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,280
potentially even redundancy.

1281
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,880
So now what happens with redundancy?

1282
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,480
Well, maybe it becomes the generacy.

1283
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,760
So while this is doing that

1284
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,080
and I have a certainty that it's gonna keep doing that

1285
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,000
because this is super certain

1286
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,960
and this is likely to return,

1287
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,720
now I can maybe venture off and try something different

1288
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,880
because even if I die, even if part of me dies,

1289
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,720
this is pretty certain to continue.

1290
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,560
So now I have the capacity to not only

1291
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:01,800
should this die continue having the same function

1292
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,920
but should this die return to that function, right?

1293
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,880
We both have the capacity to maintain that function

1294
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,880
where we have high certainty over this path

1295
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,080
which we know is a good path,

1296
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,280
but we also have the capacity to learn more

1297
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,560
and become more fit relative to a landscape

1298
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,760
and expand such that one day

1299
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,920
when relative to this system, the black swan arrives,

1300
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,560
we are so big now, we have so many paths.

1301
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,560
The black swan is no longer gonna be a black swan,

1302
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,480
the likelihood of a black swan decreases

1303
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,640
as you increase your fitness landscape.

1304
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,120
And have you studied,

1305
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,560
redundancy is quite an interesting one

1306
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,120
because presumably the system would learn

1307
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,440
its own level of redundancy

1308
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,680
and that must surely be related to things

1309
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,160
like its behavioral complexity

1310
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,640
and like its sense world environment and so on.

1311
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:56,760
So Alex Kieffer, so we wrote a paper on this specifically

1312
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:01,400
and Alex Kieffer wrote a beautiful formalism

1313
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,960
that basically qualified redundancy

1314
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,160
as a degree of useless complexity.

1315
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,400
Anything that is not useless complexity is degeneracy.

1316
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,560
So I have two hands, but if I use one hand,

1317
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,760
the other isn't useless, right?

1318
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:18,680
It can do other things.

1319
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,480
We can play the piano, et cetera.

1320
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,920
Like it has the capacity to have different functions

1321
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,880
even if it can do the same function.

1322
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,520
But if I had five hands and they could only do two things,

1323
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,840
I'd have like three hands too many.

1324
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,120
Like it wouldn't be able,

1325
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:37,480
unless I could create some emergent patterns

1326
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:39,080
through the repetition of certain,

1327
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:42,520
at some point I would expend a lot of energy

1328
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,240
in maintaining things which are most often useless.

1329
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:49,320
Interesting, but so I agree that

1330
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,040
we have to be really economical with function

1331
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,560
because function is our interface.

1332
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,800
But I was talking earlier about,

1333
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,560
in this active inference framework,

1334
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,320
we could potentially swap out agents

1335
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,320
with different skill programs.

1336
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,240
So we could have like a marketplace of intelligence.

1337
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,080
But then it's kind of degenerate

1338
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:12,240
to have lots of agents kicking about that we're not using

1339
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,440
because we're holding onto them on the basis

1340
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:16,160
that they might be useful in the future.

1341
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,720
So we come into a new regime.

1342
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,040
Oh, let's bring this guy back in

1343
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,120
because it's started making good predictions again.

1344
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:24,840
But I don't wanna be holding these guys around for too long.

1345
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,600
So I think you mean redundant.

1346
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:27,560
They would be redundant

1347
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,400
because they wouldn't be doing any other function.

1348
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,000
If they were degenerate,

1349
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,240
they would be trying to expand the fitness landscape

1350
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,080
and therefore they would never be useless.

1351
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:38,120
Well, I would say that they are harming

1352
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:41,320
the intelligence of the overall collective

1353
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,080
because they are essentially,

1354
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:47,040
they're creating predictions which are not useful.

1355
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,680
They're polluting the predictive apparatus.

1356
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,600
But no, I think it's an interesting point.

1357
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,960
But so come back to what you were saying before.

1358
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,600
So you said if they are hanging around,

1359
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,440
they are degeneracy.

1360
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,960
So what's the difference between redundancy and degeneracy?

1361
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:05,800
So that's the thing.

1362
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,920
I think if they're just hanging around

1363
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:12,000
and not doing anything, then they're just redundant.

1364
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,080
But if they're doing stuff

1365
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,760
which is rowing in the wrong direction,

1366
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:16,720
then it's degeneracy.

1367
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,200
Yeah, I mean, degeneracy doesn't entail

1368
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,520
that you're gonna necessarily go in the right direction,

1369
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,360
but it gives you the possibility to,

1370
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,160
which means you can increase your fitness landscape.

1371
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,680
So increasing your fitness landscape

1372
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,240
also means accruing error.

1373
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,440
Like you're going to make some errors

1374
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,560
and some parts of you are gonna die.

1375
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:39,600
So it's sometimes okay to continue accruing error.

1376
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,320
This is why I think that the distinction

1377
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,880
between degeneracy and redundancy is important.

1378
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:47,480
If you're just expanding energy for something

1379
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:50,160
which literally doesn't help you right now

1380
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,320
but is doing the same thing as something else

1381
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,840
which would potentially help you,

1382
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,920
and it's not, like there's so much redundancy

1383
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:02,600
that let's say given some error,

1384
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,960
you still wouldn't need it,

1385
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,960
then it's probably best to pull it away.

1386
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:10,760
But if it's doing something else in the meantime,

1387
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:13,400
even if it's rowing in the wrong direction,

1388
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,600
it's still doing something.

1389
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:20,040
It's still trying to compute some error

1390
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,800
and it's possible that over time,

1391
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,080
you will find that this is just not a thing you ever need.

1392
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,280
You will have accrued so much error

1393
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,680
that you'll just push it away.

1394
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,360
And this is how your system changes over time as well.

1395
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:35,760
You don't just necessarily like grow as a blob, right?

1396
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,440
You sometimes you just prune and you push it away.

1397
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,680
And it is good for you to learn

1398
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,520
that you had to get rid of it.

1399
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:44,400
You wouldn't necessarily know otherwise.

1400
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,680
Yeah, yeah, it's stimulating some thoughts actually

1401
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,280
because I guess it's very similar

1402
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,200
to Friston's idea of entropy.

1403
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:53,960
So, you know, like maintaining behavioral complexity

1404
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,640
because it might be useful.

1405
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,880
But there's this thing with gradient optimization.

1406
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,440
When you do monotonic gradient optimization,

1407
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,280
you kind of expect to just strip away anything

1408
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,000
that's not helping me.

1409
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,680
And sometimes you need to like maintain the degeneracy

1410
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,000
for a significant amount of time

1411
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,720
before it becomes useful later.

1412
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,000
So like in Friston's framework,

1413
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,320
I think it's like it's keeping it around,

1414
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,600
but for quite a long time.

1415
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:24,480
Yeah, so I think it's all about the amount of energy

1416
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,960
you have as say capital.

1417
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,800
And I think it touches into something really interesting

1418
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,920
about psychology, like hoarders.

1419
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,080
Why do hoarders exist?

1420
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,080
Like if you ask them, what's the likelihood

1421
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:46,480
of you ever using that thing, like ever at all?

1422
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,160
And they're like, well, maybe I'll need it.

1423
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,440
And then you point out to them a situation,

1424
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:52,840
well, the situation happened where you would have needed it

1425
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,320
and you still didn't use it.

1426
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:55,280
Now, what do you think?

1427
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,120
And it just, it doesn't update.

1428
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:02,520
So to them, it's like they don't have the right capacity

1429
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:05,560
to update their model such that over time,

1430
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,840
even given that probability and the fact that it happened,

1431
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,360
et cetera, they can't prune it.

1432
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,000
But if it doesn't cost you anything,

1433
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,880
like you just have a, you have an adapter at home

1434
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:18,000
and you never go to the US,

1435
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,200
but you still have it and it's like, whatever,

1436
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,200
you know, it doesn't cause that much error.

1437
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:28,080
Maybe it's worth maintaining the possibility of a policy

1438
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,120
which would use it.

1439
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,600
It's more about

1440
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:37,360
given the pool of policies you're maintaining,

1441
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:39,760
how much does it cost you to maintain a policy

1442
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,320
that goes all the way over there,

1443
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,400
even though you can tell your viability is over here.

1444
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:47,720
You could choose to do so and maybe it'll be adaptive,

1445
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,520
but if it isn't, effectively the kind of system

1446
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:53,800
that maintains the wrong balance

1447
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,800
over the type of redundancy and degeneracy

1448
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,800
that it maintains is just gonna,

1449
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,960
yeah, it's gonna perish faster than the others.

1450
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,600
Yeah, yeah.

1451
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,400
Well, this has been amazing.

1452
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,840
Thank you so much for chatting with me.

1453
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,200
You're welcome, it was fun.
