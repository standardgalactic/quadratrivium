0	4120	Yeah, we're just like backups. We love net net Netflix
4120	7440	quality productions. Okay, well, in which case, let's kick
7440	10080	off. So we've we've had a couple of technical problems
10080	12600	with the stream. So now we're going to go pre recorded
12600	15800	instead, which is absolutely fine. So we're going to talk
15800	19360	about quite a few things today. Now, one big theme, I think
19360	23600	is talking about an activism and the kind of compatibility
23920	27360	between the free energy principle and an activism. We're
27360	31000	going to talk about. Now we have to be very careful how we
31000	35480	pronounce this words auto poetic. Is that right, Maxwell?
35600	39480	That's right. Yes. Amazing. So forgive me when I get it
39480	42320	wrong. I'm going to get it wrong. I'm sorry. So we're
42320	44920	talking about auto poetic and activism, which of which, of
44920	49280	course, was the brainchild of Varela. And there's an
49280	51320	interesting paper that came out, which was actually quite
51320	54320	critical of FEP. We're going to talk about some of the points
54320	56480	in that paper. And that was called laying down a forking
56480	59720	path tensions between an action and the free energy principle.
60000	62640	And in that paper, there were a few areas. So there was the
62640	67160	definition of auto poesis, historicity. So we're talking
67160	71240	about temporal sequence invariance and non steady state
71240	75440	equilibria and what it means to be a Goddick. There was this
75520	78400	critique about the non stationarity of distributions.
78560	81280	And also really interesting discussion about internalism
81320	84600	versus externalism, because of course, the the inactive view
84600	89040	is is is a form of externalised cognition, which is this very
89040	92960	interesting view that you have cognizizing elements outside
93000	96000	of the mind in the environment around you. So we'll talk about
96000	98760	that as well. We'll touch on goal directedness and also
98760	101840	structure learning, which is a really, really exciting thing
101840	105800	in in any any Bayesian cognitive framework. Now on the call
105800	108520	today, we have obviously, first of all, Professor Karl
108520	112080	Friston, the inventor of the free energy principle and active
112080	115120	inference, a man who requires no introduction whatsoever.
115120	116920	Professor Friston, welcome to the show.
117960	118760	Great to be back.
121480	125680	Fabulous. We also have Dr. Maxwell Ramstead, one of the top
125680	128800	scholars in the free energy principle and the active
128800	131240	inference literature. Of course, we've had Maxwell on very
131240	132920	recently, but welcome back Maxwell.
133800	134840	Always a pleasure, gentlemen.
135240	138680	Amazing. And we also have a new face. Professor Buckley, would
138680	139840	you like to introduce yourself?
140800	144720	Yeah, yeah. So yeah, my I'm a faculty member at the University
144720	150200	of Sussex, but I also work with versus with Maxwell and Karl. So
150200	153680	I have a background originally in physics in postgraduate in
153680	156960	physics, and then moved into cognitive robotics. I was kind
156960	161880	of working in behavior based robotics, and an activism somewhat
161880	166240	early on my my PhD, moved into kind of theoretical neuroscience,
166480	169400	and kind of really got interested in the free energy
169440	173640	principle about eight or nine or so years ago and wrote a review
173640	177960	on it. Originally, you know, wanted to challenge it and
177960	179920	then eventually fell in love with it and now think it's the
179920	184560	right way to go for it for what we want to do. So I came as a
184560	188560	skeptic and then have been bashed into into into place. Do you
188560	191640	think now this is is the correct way to think about things?
192240	195880	Amazing. Well, let's let the bashing commence. Well, we'll
195880	198680	move straight on to the subject of an activism. So there is this
198680	201480	paper laying down a forking path tensions between an action and
201480	204000	the free energy principle. And the name is very hard to
204000	208600	pronounce it as Esquiel de Paolo. Paolo.
211600	215560	Okay, thank you so much. Now, just just to be fair to them,
215960	220480	because Maxwell, you did actually couch FEP as an activism 2.0,
220960	227160	despite the inactivist rejection of information methods. And maybe
227160	231240	we should start by defining an activism. And also, there's some
231240	235480	similarities with this other idea called ecological psychology.
236280	238680	So why don't why don't we just start by framing some of these
238680	239440	ideas up?
241840	244280	That sounds good. Yeah, I think that's a great idea.
245400	248520	Did you have like a pre prepared definition you wanted to
248520	250720	share? Do you want us to riff on this?
251600	255360	Well, why don't why don't we start with Varela's an activism?
255760	260640	So there are some so it's in terms of philosophy, there are hints
260640	264240	of existentialism and phenomenology and eastern influences
264240	268080	and focus on lived experience and stuff like that. One of the and
268080	271880	the core things is that they reject information processing and
271880	275360	computationalism. They focus on actions and interactions.
276360	279720	It's a very embodied tradition. So why don't we just kind of
279760	280520	start with that?
281400	285120	Okay, yeah, that's a great way to set it up. Well, I mean, we should
285120	289280	probably just add a little bit of context and a few caveats
289280	293640	before launching into this. So I think Chris and I are of the
293640	298320	generation that was trained in the inactive embodied tradition.
299320	303080	I would describe myself as a reformed inactivist. I don't
303080	307440	know if Chris, you resonate with that I still believe in
307440	308200	activism. Yeah.
309160	315160	So these, the inactive approach is one of the so called four e
315200	319600	approaches that have become very popular since the 90s. And I
319600	323080	would argue is, at least in in the more philosophically
323080	326480	informed corners of cognitive science and neuroscience, basically
326480	332680	the dominant theoretical paradigm right now. So it we have to
332680	336520	say there's a this is a broad church of approaches that go
336600	342760	from a more kind of minimalist recognition that cognition
342800	347360	involves bodily processes to the more radical approaches that
347360	351880	you were describing earlier that just wholesale reject
352560	356400	information theory, the computation, the computational
356440	360000	metaphor for mind that mind is basically a kind of computing
360000	365600	device. And yeah, the inactive approach grew out of
365680	370120	auto poetic theory. They're distinct. It's important to say.
370360	376160	So auto poetic theory was developed by Maturana and Barrela
376680	383840	sometime in the 1980s and 90s. And it was a very mechanistic
383840	389280	approach to mind. I mean, you know, some of the early kind of
389280	393800	flagship papers in this tradition are what the frogs I
393840	396600	tells the frogs brain and this kind of stuff. So you know, hard
396600	403960	nose kind of systems biology type thinking. And I mean, there
403960	411200	was basically a break in the literature where due to Barrela
411240	416000	in a lot of ways, the emphasis moving from kind of mechanistic
416000	421040	models to phenomenology to a kind of more dynamic, coupling
421040	426080	interactive kind of mode of explanation. So yeah, the inactive
426080	429840	approach is basically committed to this idea, fundamentally that
430520	433880	cognition is basically bringing about a world, a structured
433880	439080	world of meaning and significance through adaptive
439120	446080	appropriate actions left in the world. So the the slogan is, you
446080	452080	know, yeah, exactly constructing this meaning, you know, laying
452080	455280	down a path and walking, I think is the the slogan, the poetic
455280	462040	slogan form that's so popular. Yeah, and in its more radical
462040	466960	inclinations, this inactive approach says, dynamical
466960	473600	systems is really the way to study systems that have mind. And
473640	477080	so the kind of the background assumption there is that there's
477080	480640	a fork in the path in the road somewhere, you know, where we
480640	485200	have to choose between information theory and dynamics. And
485200	490200	yet they obviously go down the dynamics path. So I think that's
490200	493640	a setup. And before launching into criticism, I should say that
493640	497720	we as a community, genuinely appreciate and benefit from
497920	502720	friendly critical engagement. So I just want to caveat all this
502720	506000	by saying that the criticism comes from a place of wanting to
506000	511120	build community from a place from our hearts, basically. And
511240	514680	yeah, although I'm going to be saying a lot of critical stuff
514680	518760	about the inactive approach. In my heart, I'm an inactivist, I
518760	525080	think just that the a lot of the, a lot of the methodology and
525080	529280	explanatory constructs that are leveraged in the approach are
529360	532240	problematic. And in particular, you see this come out when
532720	536800	the free energy principle comes into play. So
536840	539600	So Chris, do you want to add anything to that that definition?
539600	543440	Yeah, I mean, I guess it's like, I see, I'm going to use this kind
543440	547800	of phraseology was in in one of Carl's books, which is a low
547800	552080	road and a high road and activism. I basically was brought up a
552080	555080	low road and activist rights. So this is kind of rejection of
555080	558600	representationalism in cognitive architectures. It was a
558600	561280	move away from good old fashioned artificial intelligence to
561280	565120	embedded and embodied agents. So this is kind of the origin in
565120	568560	Rodney Brooks's behavior based approaches to robotics. And
568560	571760	those are the kinds of ideas I still embrace. And then there's
571920	575560	the kind of high road and activism, which kind of embraces
575560	579520	auto pieces and operational closure at its heart. I mean,
579560	582880	to me, I mean, if you're if you're a high road and activists,
582880	585680	they are the same thing, they are they come from the same place.
585960	588520	But I think there's a kind of there is a there are messages
588520	590760	to take from an activism and the low road, which are super
590760	593480	important for cognition, right, without kind of going into the
593480	597880	depths of the auto poesis. Just in terms of like the language,
597880	601960	I think, I think there is a split between dynamical systems
601960	604600	theory, which is kind of the origins of descriptions of
604600	607280	automatic systems and information theory, but that that
607280	610480	community has begun to embrace, you know, a little bit of
610480	615000	information theory, but it tends to has been done through kind
615000	617840	of phenomenological models, simple models, rather than kind
617960	622560	of have this kind of theoretical angle or deep theoretical basis
622560	626040	in something like Bayes that like we do, right? I mean, I to
626040	630560	that paper, I read it before we come to me, it doesn't seem, you
630560	632440	know, some of the language is quite dismissive. But to me, it
632440	636080	seems an opportunity to see whether we can reconcile these
636080	638480	frameworks. And I think they've done a nice job in pointing
638480	641080	where there are maybe things we can express better within the
641080	643080	free energy principle that kind of address things like
643080	646600	operational closure. I feel that this community sometimes feels
646640	652360	like it has to be divided. But I'm very much an inclusive
652560	657760	person. So some really nice dialogue between people in an
657760	660640	activism and what we do in the active inference and the free
660640	661360	energy principle.
661920	665040	Interesting. I mean, I'll bring Professor Friston in in just a
665040	667480	second. But I was reading this very interesting paper by by
667480	672400	Maxwell, written in, I think it's 2019, multi scale integration
672440	676560	or internalism. And I was 21. Okay, so it's the multi scale
676560	680400	integration paper. And you know, of course, this this an active
680400	682840	philosophy is all about externalism. So you know, you
682840	687240	actually have these cognizing elements outside of of where
687240	692200	the brain is. And in a way, it's, there's this Helm-Hopsian
692240	695160	sharp separation between the organism and the environment,
695160	698320	which is perhaps embraced by neuroscientists. But the
698320	700880	interesting thing about the free energy principle is, is I
700880	704960	think it maintains some vagueness about this notion of
704960	708320	whether it's an internalist system, where you have strong
708320	712840	representations and predictive power about what's going on in
712840	717760	the world around you, versus being this kind of dynamical
717760	720920	externalist, inactive type system. And in that paper,
720920	723560	Maxwell, you are saying that well, actually, we can integrate
723560	727600	the two views because you can have these nested boundaries. And
727600	732120	as Professor Friston has said, human minds, the reason we have
732120	735000	this temporal depth of planning and sophistication and
735000	738080	representation building and so on, is because we're at the top
738080	741960	of the stack. But there's many, many layers below us where
742080	746520	perhaps it is more of an inactive externalized form of
746520	749800	cognition. So we can kind of speak to both worlds. But
749880	751760	Professor Friston, perhaps you could come in on that.
755760	760120	Yeah, I was frightened, you were going to ask me well, if I had
760120	763920	anything to add about inactivism, because I haven't, I'm here
763920	767040	to find out whether I'm an inactivist or not. So at the
767040	769920	end, it's only come tell me whether I'm an inactivist, I'd
769920	772600	be very grateful. There's probably some nuanced version of
772600	776080	it, like a moderate, epistemological inactivist
776080	785160	retrying. So I think, in that last point, Tim, I think is a
785160	787720	really interesting one. And in fact, I just reviewed a paper
787800	790720	synthese yesterday, I think, touching upon this issue from a
790720	796040	philosophical perspective. But very simply, the free energy
796040	799960	principle basically will accommodate both perspectives. It
799960	804120	rests upon an externalist view of the universe as a random
804120	809760	dynamical system, that just by equipping that system with a
809760	812880	partition that separates something from everything else,
813240	818520	then induces an internalist explanation for the way that
818520	823520	thing makes sense of its universe. So there is a necessary
823520	826480	enmeshing of both the externalist and the internalist
826480	830800	perspectives. You put it another way, the internalist
830800	836520	perspective is entirely licensed in terms of the
836960	840920	interpretation of self organization as a process of
841160	846160	inference. And you're with that an explicit commitment to a
846160	849320	certain kind of representationalism. But that only
849320	852240	inherits from the way you start from, which is an
852240	857680	externalist view of the thing in an external world with with a
857680	860640	particular metaphysics here described in terms of random
860640	863600	dynamical systems. And it's interesting, also, you pick up
863600	868480	on this fork in the road, which I confess, I completely, I do
868520	874000	not understand. You know, all interesting information theory
874040	880840	read as probability theory, that is used in physics inherits
880840	884640	from dynamical systems. You know, we're talking thing
884640	888200	ranging, things ranging from the master equation through
888200	891520	to Schrodinger's wave equation, the Fokker-Planck
891520	895680	equation, Comer of Ford equations, all of these are
895680	899640	information theoretic treatments of dynamical systems. So I don't
899640	904040	really understand the nature of this fork. So I probably should
904040	905480	now pass you back to me.
905520	909880	Well, can I follow up on that, Chris? And then maybe I don't
909880	913600	get it either. And so what what confuses me about it is, one of
913600	917280	the the brilliant things about the free energy principle, to me
917280	921720	is this exact connection between random dynamical systems of a
921720	924440	certain degree of complexity, let's say approaching
924880	928600	auto poetic, right? And in this behavior that they must
928600	933160	manifest in order to be what they are, right, which is which is
933160	936080	this balancing between between, you know, uncertainty and
936080	939440	prediction and that sort of thing. So to me, they're hand and
939440	942240	glove. And so I guess my question to you, Chris, since you were
942240	945000	going to jump in there is, what is the source of this conflict?
945000	947840	Like, is it a fear that if it's linked, if you link the
948080	951480	information and dynamics in this certain way that they have to
951480	954080	conform to this principle that we're all going to be put out of
954080	956280	work, or we're not going to be able to study the things we want
956280	959240	to study or just do you mind if I just quickly interject with a
959240	963480	little bit of context? Okay. Just to I wanted to elaborate a
963480	967040	little bit on what Carl said, because I think there were some
967040	969480	things in here that might move in what Carl said that might not
969480	975320	be clear to the audience of the bears repeating. The first is
975320	979600	that there's this idea that Markov blankets kind of seclude the
979600	983240	organism from the environment. This is sort of like the
983240	988360	Helmholtz style story where our relationship to the environment
988360	991840	is in some sense only indirect and we are separated from the
991880	994440	environment by our Markov blanket. The important thing to
994440	996920	point out is that just definitionally, the Markov
996920	1001040	blanket comprises the set of degrees of freedom that separate
1001040	1006640	and couple systems together. So it's not the veil, it's the
1006640	1012280	interface. So that's the first thing to point out. So a radically
1012280	1015400	internalist interpretation of the free energy principle doesn't
1015400	1018680	work, because you actually need external states to be in play
1018680	1021400	for the math tour. If there are no external states, then there's
1021400	1024040	nothing to track. And there's nothing beyond the Markov
1024040	1027080	blanket. So you don't get the story started, like it doesn't get
1027080	1029960	off the ground. If you don't assume that there are these
1029960	1032960	things that the particle in question that the thing that
1032960	1036880	you're interested in is a tuning to and that so there needs to be
1036880	1039960	something to couple and to be separated from for the story to
1039960	1044520	get off the ground. So yeah, it's a if you write down your
1044520	1048080	dynamical systems equations, it's always the generative model
1048080	1050720	that we keep talking about is defined over your internal
1050760	1053560	blanket and external states. So that's the first point. What
1053560	1056440	Carlos is the other the other way around to which is if you're
1056440	1060720	empty of all internal states, and every single state you have
1060720	1063480	can be influenced from the outside. Well, there's less to
1063480	1066440	talk about. Well, then you're not a thing, strictly speaking,
1066440	1071960	right? That so you know, it's it's definitional to what it is to
1071960	1076200	be a thing to have this kind of interface between that thing
1076200	1081440	and other things. So that's a first point. So the internal
1081440	1083360	states as your point as you're pointing out do play an
1083360	1086200	asymmetric role. So the FEP says if you have this boundary,
1086200	1088320	then the internal states are going to parameterize the
1088320	1091520	belief about external states. So you do get this kind of
1091520	1095640	internalist looking thing going as well. So the there is a I
1095640	1099400	think a a kind of reconciliation of internalism and
1099400	1101800	externalism under the free energy principle. This is what the
1101800	1105600	2019 paper that you are referring to is about. It's
1105600	1108680	called multiscale integration. And that's precisely the idea
1108680	1111880	that things that look separated at one scale can be integrated
1111880	1115000	within, you know, the auspices of an overarching structure at
1115000	1118920	the scale above and so on and so on and so on. We're separate as
1119040	1121640	individuals, but we're coupled in this active inference
1121640	1124400	community. And, you know, arguably, there's an intentionality
1124440	1127880	also at play there. Same thing for ourselves, right? Our
1127880	1130240	cells are separate because they have their individual
1130240	1132520	boundaries, but then they're integrated on the time scale
1132520	1137320	of me as an organism and so on. So that's that was about
1137360	1140120	internalism and externalism. I wanted to speak quickly to the
1140120	1144040	split between dynamics and information theory. Whenever I
1144040	1146640	talked to my friends in high end mathematics about this, they
1146640	1149360	are always as perplexed as you know, Keith and Carl, you are
1149360	1153920	because it's a nonsensical starting point. To do dynamical
1153920	1157000	systems theory seriously, you at some point are going to need
1157000	1160320	to appeal to information theoretic measures. So for
1160320	1163480	example, distances in state space. So, you know, the
1163480	1165880	inactivists are all thought, you know, they like to appeal to
1165880	1168440	dynamical systems theory and stuff, but the systems that
1168440	1171240	they're considering are usually extremely simple, with a few
1171240	1173720	degrees of freedom that are coupled together. But if you
1173720	1178640	want to do like, you know, grown up, dynamical systems theory,
1178800	1181000	then you're going to need to appeal to things like information
1181000	1184400	length to describe the really the metrics on your state space,
1184400	1187880	you can't avoid that. Similarly, when we're talking about
1187880	1190480	information, we're talking about dynamical, you know, the
1190480	1193840	dynamic time course of the these coupling. So we're interested
1193840	1196440	in the dynamics of information, these things are not actually
1196440	1201080	separable. The idea that they are comes from philosophy,
1201080	1205360	actually, it's a set of papers from the basically late 80s,
1205360	1211280	early 90s by Van Gelder, and Port. And at the time, you know,
1211280	1214160	dynamical systems theory was a new thing in cognitive science.
1214160	1216680	And what they were saying was, Hey, there's this approach that
1216680	1219800	we can take, it's dynamical systems, it's not computational.
1219960	1224320	And basically, it moved from there to there's an there's this
1224320	1227520	alternative approach that's mutually incompatible. And that
1227520	1231160	shift kind of happened slowly by a self referential literature.
1231160	1234040	So, you know, this is where I'm going to be a bit critical. You
1234040	1237440	can really do the historiography and trace these claims back to
1238400	1241080	I mean, basically Van Gelder and Port, and to some extent
1241080	1244760	Gibson. But these folks, they don't offer a formal argument,
1244800	1247080	right? Like, they're not saying here's a proof that dynamical
1247080	1249480	systems and compute computational approaches are like
1249480	1253320	incompatible. They're just starting with this gut feeling
1253320	1255680	that hey, maybe there's something different here. And then
1255680	1259960	that turns into I would argue, splurrata sizes or like hardens
1260000	1264640	into like an a priori dogmatism, crystallizes that isn't
1264640	1269160	necessary. Yeah, exactly. That is just based, like I was saying
1269160	1272880	on this kind of circular, you know, we're just citing other
1272880	1276520	philosophers who cite other philosophers who are making this
1276520	1281160	stuff up at the bottom. So, yeah, I mean, I kind of feel like
1281160	1283880	this is a problem with the philosophy literature is like,
1284200	1287360	you know, taking just conceptual arguments from other
1287400	1290680	philosophers, maybe a bit more seriously than they should,
1290840	1294120	without really taking the time to do the proper historiography,
1294240	1296800	looking where these claims are originating, and then asking
1296800	1299440	the question, is there any real warrant for this kind of
1299440	1303040	separation? So yeah, I've been going around recently saying
1303040	1306200	that yeah, this split between dynamics and information theory
1306200	1308720	is mostly in people's imaginations. There's no
1308720	1310080	mathematical basis for it.
1310640	1314320	And Chris, you wanted to jump in. No, no, thank you wanted to
1314320	1317000	jump in earlier and maybe talk about your personal journey
1317040	1318080	that might come into play here.
1318400	1321960	Yeah, I mean, Maxwell's, you know, said some really
1321960	1324760	interesting stuff there. I mean, I guess I take a slightly
1324760	1328800	less hard line on that, right? I mean, I think it's a historical
1328800	1331240	thing. So Tim Van Gelder, we're looking at deterministic
1331560	1333680	dynamical systems theory, like this is in the absence of
1333680	1337080	noise. And unless you do ensembles of systems, it's not
1337120	1340720	there's no clear pathway then to information theory. And then
1340920	1345920	initially in models, when in the 80s and 90s, typically, yeah,
1345920	1347440	deterministic dynamical systems theory, looking at
1347440	1350760	bifurcations and so on. And then, but obviously, the richer
1350840	1352680	the richer set of descriptions is stochastic
1352680	1355160	dynamical systems theory. And that's when information theory
1355160	1357720	becomes irreplaceable, right? This become and then they've
1357720	1361000	come fully in meshed these these descriptions as Carl writes
1361000	1364760	about so nicely and lots of his work, right? But I think, you
1364760	1368600	know, I didn't see the forking path as kind of this. I know
1368600	1370920	in the community that there's a history of using dynamical
1370920	1373280	systems theory, and there's a sense in which the free energy
1373280	1375880	is really embraced information theory. I didn't see that
1375880	1380800	that's as a as a key, the for the key in the fork of the path,
1380800	1386080	right? I mean, I got to say that it's a way out of my area,
1386080	1389280	this this kind of depth of philosophy, but it seemed to me
1389280	1391480	the kind of the problem of operate the definition of
1391480	1397760	operational closure that seemed to be upsetting to Randall
1397760	1402120	Behr and is equal to power. And the fact that they don't think
1402120	1405360	that can be embraced by the tenants of the free energy
1405360	1409160	principle. I mean, I don't I think they they made a nice case,
1409160	1413520	I don't think it a priori that's the case. I can't see there
1413520	1416480	was a hands down argument that there is this forking path. I
1416480	1420080	still think it's an interesting angle to take to think deeply
1420080	1424080	about operational closure within the free energy principle is I
1424080	1427120	know Maxwell has and he's going to tell you the answers to this,
1427120	1432040	but you know, so I'm just aware of the trickiness in defining
1432040	1433840	operational closure that's happened in the literature in the
1433840	1437440	last 20 years. And then really, in an inability to kind of
1437440	1439720	really get a concrete quantitative description of what we
1439720	1444520	mean by operational closure. And so, you know, I guess it's to
1444520	1447120	say that we've simply solved it within the free energy principle
1447120	1452320	that might that might have put some backs up somewhere. But you
1452320	1455160	know, Maxwell, maybe can give you a bit more insight to this
1455160	1458520	because he's thought deeply about how to define a place
1458560	1461960	closure within the frame. Can I can I can I frame up for you,
1461960	1467040	Maxwell? So the paper quoted you actually, I think you you said
1467040	1471440	on one of your papers that there is an analogy, almost a direct
1471440	1475280	mapping between this concept of organizational closure and a
1475280	1477840	Markov blanket. And of course, the Markov blanket is this
1478040	1480280	conditional independence that you're talking about. And you
1480280	1484480	also called it an interface earlier on. And when they speak
1484480	1488160	about the definition of auto polices, they say that, I think
1488160	1491920	the way that you folks in the FEP literature culture is mostly
1492120	1495640	as a form of autonomy, which is this ability to maintain your
1495640	1500400	own identity under precarious position, you know, situations.
1500680	1505280	And they say, well, the Varela kind of definition of auto
1505280	1510240	polices is very much about structure and organization. So
1510240	1512520	it's not it's not just maintaining your own identity,
1512520	1516160	but it's about this self organization and this kind of
1516160	1519400	generating structure as well. So I wonder just just with those
1519400	1522280	things on the table, could you, could you
1522920	1526840	absolutely. So in that paper, I confess that I probably should
1526840	1529000	have spoken, we probably should have spoken a bit more
1529000	1533120	precisely. We say the Markov blanket formalism. What we mean
1533120	1536080	by that is, and I don't think that this was fully appreciated by
1536080	1541240	the authors at the time. What we mean is Markov blankets and the
1541240	1546560	generative models, right? Because the claim is, right, let's
1546560	1550400	remind the audience, just put the terms on the table. A
1550400	1555840	generative model, right, is our model of the dependencies that
1555840	1560720	link the states and parameters that make up a given system,
1560760	1564240	right? So it is our way of talking about basically the
1564240	1567920	causal, connective tissue or structure that underwrites a
1567920	1571040	given system. And what the free energy principle says is, if
1571040	1574600	the underlying system has is disconnected in a certain
1574640	1579400	appropriate way, then you get this tracking behavior. And
1579400	1582800	formally speaking, it says, if there's a Markov blanket in
1582800	1587160	this dependency structure, right, if conditioned on certain
1587160	1590120	blanket states, then it looks as if subsets of the system are
1590120	1593160	independent from each other, but also tracking each other,
1593160	1596960	then you know, you get you get this interesting behavior, like
1596960	1600240	the if there is this Markov blanket is if there is this
1600320	1602600	independent structure, then you will get this tracking
1602600	1604480	behavior. That's what the free energy principle is talking
1604480	1609360	about. So of course, it's not sufficient to say that things
1609440	1613240	are carved out in a specific way. And therefore, you know, you
1613240	1616120	can say interesting things about them. But I think what's
1616160	1620160	missed in the argument, and this has to do with like, you know,
1620160	1625520	I think the app, the, the, the, I'll say, provocatively, the
1625560	1629440	dogmatic commitment to anti-representationalism is like
1629480	1632480	what when the inactivists read generative model, they mean a
1632480	1635560	model in my head that I carry around, they hear like a
1635560	1640240	representation, right? But what's really at stake is the
1640240	1644160	generative model is the dependency structure. Right? So if
1644160	1647160	you have the right kind of dependency structure that
1647160	1650560	generates a Markov blanket, I would say that you have what the
1650560	1654360	inactivists call operational closure. In fact, you can show
1654360	1657120	this mathematically, it's I don't think it's appreciated, but
1657800	1662320	there is a duality that has been rigorously established. Dalton
1662320	1666360	Shakti Maribel is probably the main proponent of this work,
1666360	1668760	but you know, Carl has done a lot of work over the last two
1668760	1673720	decades in this direction. Yeah, I think the the kind of core
1673720	1679200	idea to remember is that minimizing your variational
1679200	1683080	entropy with your variational free energy with respect to a
1683080	1686480	generative model, right? So the usual free energy story, right,
1686640	1691080	is dual to or equivalent to maximizing your entropy with
1691080	1695960	respect to a set of constraints. So when the inactivists talk
1695960	1699440	about constraint closure and all this stuff, you know, Alicia
1699440	1703240	Gerero's new book, context changes, everything, the
1703240	1707320	inactivists in the auto poetic tradition really want to go
1707320	1709720	hard on this and say, Well, what you really need to do is map a
1709720	1712640	set of constraints, such that the system kind of self
1712680	1716480	generates. Well, that is rigorously, and absolutely
1716520	1720120	equivalent to minimizing your free energy with respect to a
1720120	1723200	generative model, there's no difference there. So we're talking
1723200	1725720	about the same thing, we're talking about the way that like a
1725720	1729840	set of structured dependencies generates a thing that's able to
1729840	1733960	sustain itself over time. And as I was saying, this sustained
1733960	1736200	over time is a way of describing the interface or
1736200	1740160	coupling between the system and its environment. So that just
1740200	1742880	mathematically, we're talking about the same thing.
1744480	1747200	But let me ask you a question here, because there's, and this
1747200	1750160	is hopefully because I like Carl, I want to find out if I'm an
1750160	1753280	inactivist. So maybe, maybe you can help set us up for
1753280	1755960	considering this, a big bone of contention for them in that
1755960	1759360	paper, is this distinction that they have in their mind between
1759600	1764000	structure and organization. And they seem to get upset when any
1764000	1767920	attempt is made to link organization to structure. For
1767920	1772400	example, you know, to me, the Markov boundary that say
1772400	1777480	analogous to a, a animal cell membrane, I understand as a
1777480	1781320	former person who studied biology, that the molecules of
1781320	1784560	that membrane are in flux, things come and go, proteins
1784560	1787720	are added, carbohydrates are removed, etc. I don't have in
1787720	1791280	my mind a set of molecules that's like they're forever, and
1791280	1794960	some type of like, you know, stationary structure, like it's
1794960	1798400	a very dynamic kind of system. But they seem to say, Oh, no,
1798400	1801800	if you if you equate, you know, a Markov boundary to an
1801800	1804400	organizational structure, then you're making this, you know,
1804600	1808080	fallacy of kind where you're associating like an organization
1808320	1811080	with like the substrate that, you know, manifests that in
1811080	1813720	reality. Like, can you explain to me like what they were
1813720	1817320	actually up and about with this organization structure? You
1817320	1819640	know, maybe Carl, if you could comment on it, when Maxwell
1819640	1824280	tells us so we can figure out if we're an activist. So I'll just
1824280	1827160	let me bracket the stuff about stationarity and historicity
1827160	1832400	for one second. Because I have some stuff to say about that. But
1832440	1836200	so it comes back to that we'll come back to that question about
1836200	1839120	that. It comes back to what I was saying about, you know, it's
1839120	1842160	not just about Markov blankets, it's about generative models. If
1842160	1845320	you don't appreciate the distinction. And what you think
1845480	1848720	we're saying is Markov blankets tell the whole story, then
1848720	1851160	obviously, you're going to, you know, think that we're
1851160	1854400	conflating structure and organization. When you realize
1854400	1857520	that what we're talking about is, you know, a Markov blanket
1857520	1862080	within this dependency structure, right, that then I think you
1862120	1864400	you move to something else, I would say like what the
1864400	1867200	inactivist called structure corresponds to these Markov
1867200	1870600	blankets that we're drawing. And the organization we talk
1870600	1873440	about, and we harness in the generative model, right, that
1873440	1875720	remember, the generative model is not my internal
1875720	1878440	representation in my head, it's the overall dependency
1878440	1880880	structure of the system. It's what they would call the
1880880	1884400	organization of the system. So I mean, I would agree that we
1884400	1887840	shouldn't conflate them. And I would, you know, add that we
1887840	1891840	don't, there are distinct constructs that map onto these
1891840	1895400	things. And, you know, I would also point out that Markov
1895400	1901560	blankets are flexible. We will be putting out work over the
1901560	1905280	next few months on wandering Markov blankets, like we've got
1905400	1909120	figured out algorithmically now, we can draw a blanket around a
1909120	1911760	flame and stuff like that. Now, so we've got all of that
1911760	1913480	working. And it's not
1913480	1915920	I've been looking forward to that since Carl mentioned it in
1915920	1919560	the first, the first interview with him, let's, let's set an
1919560	1921160	anchor to come back to that because that that's very
1921160	1923720	interesting. Actually, one comment you made in your
1923720	1927280	multi scale paper was that these are ontological boundaries by
1927280	1930520	which I think you are implying that they are not a lens, they
1930520	1933760	are fixed to some extent. But I want to just stick on this
1934200	1936720	organization point for a second, though. So in the paper,
1936720	1942440	they said that essentially the way the FEP couches this is as a
1942440	1946520	form of homeostasis, which is just about, you know, maintaining
1946520	1949360	structural properties. And when they spoke about organization,
1949360	1952840	they said the conservation of organization is what's spoken
1952840	1956040	about in the classic orthopedic literature. And I think you are
1956040	1958640	just making the argument Maxwell that that that generative
1958640	1962840	model is in some sense the conservation of organization. So
1962840	1965600	is that the missing link? I mean, maybe a professor for us and
1965600	1966280	you can come in.
1968520	1970400	Yeah, do you want to take that Carl? I mean, I think that's
1970400	1973920	right. But Carl will probably comment more eloquently than I
1973920	1974440	on that.
1974880	1977120	I don't think so. I think you're being very eloquent.
1977720	1978080	Thank you.
1978680	1982680	Do your worst and then I'll chip in if necessary.
1988520	1991440	Yeah, I mean, I think that's that's exactly right. Like the
1992200	1996840	Markov blankets don't have to be permanent. They can be
1996840	2000720	shifting and basically minimizing your free energy with
2000720	2003880	respect to some generative model corresponds to keeping some
2003880	2005240	structure in play.
2006720	2010080	Yep. Actually, this segue is nicely into the stuff about
2010080	2013640	stationarity and historicity. I think this is the biggest
2013640	2017240	problem in their paper. They claim that the free energy
2017240	2020960	principle can't account for historicity, in the sense that
2020960	2025160	it can't account for path dependency, right? So for our
2025160	2028520	audience, path dependency is this idea that it's not just your
2028520	2032000	position in state space that matters. It's also your velocity,
2032040	2035480	roughly speaking, right? That like the kind of direction that
2035480	2039640	you're going in, where you came from is just as important to
2039640	2043680	where you're going is where you are currently. And they claim
2043680	2046240	that, you know, the free energy, so they make a bunch of false
2046240	2048560	claims about the free energy principle, which leads them
2048560	2050640	astray. So for example, they claim that the free energy
2050640	2055400	principle assumes stationarity. It doesn't. As we've discussed
2055400	2057600	before, there are different applications of the free energy
2057600	2060080	principle in the literature. The two main families of
2060080	2066360	applications are density dynamics and path intervals. So I
2066360	2069840	drink a lot of coffee. And if you were to sample me at random
2069840	2073240	during the day, I would say there's a one in 25 chance. Yeah,
2073240	2076560	exactly. I would say there's a one in 25 chance that I'm
2076560	2079120	drinking coffee if you just sample me randomly during the
2079120	2084040	day. If you were to sample me over a week, once per day,
2084040	2088280	there's a 100% chance that I would drink coffee per day, right?
2088280	2090760	So there's a difference between looking at the probability of
2090760	2094320	states of me, you know, Maxwell is drinking coffee, and the
2094320	2099480	probabilities of paths of me or entire trajectories of me. And
2099520	2103520	that is a really critical distinction. The free energy
2103680	2107080	principle started off as a path based formulation. And I think
2107080	2109800	this is absolutely underappreciated in the literature.
2109800	2113000	If you look back at Carl's early papers, including the ones
2113000	2117560	that everyone has read, right? The 2010 unified brain theory
2117560	2121760	paper in nature. Yet these are all written in terms of paths.
2121800	2125240	Carl is taking like a sensory path and then writing down, you
2125240	2129600	know, blanket paths and internal paths. And it's all, it's all
2129600	2133480	about the way the trajectories of the system are maintained. So
2133480	2136360	this is a cool idea that was there before and that we're
2136360	2139720	doubling back down on now, which is that it's really, it's
2139720	2143800	about blanket paths that make internal paths independent of
2143840	2147760	external paths. So there's a sense in which like, it's always
2147760	2151920	been about counterfactual futures. It's, and it's difficult to
2151920	2154840	argue that, like, you don't account for historicity when
2154840	2158760	literally the core construct that you're deploying is, like
2158760	2162000	probabilities of different histories, like counterfactual
2162000	2166600	futures. But that entire argument about historicity makes no
2166600	2170920	sense formally, just abs, you know, and again, we appreciate
2170920	2174240	the critical engagement. This isn't to, you know, bash anyone
2174240	2177480	specifically. But like, this is a complete non starter
2177480	2181720	mathematically. Also, when you're doing density dynamics,
2181720	2184320	right, when you're not considering probability densities
2184320	2187680	over paths, but rather you're considering probabilities of
2187680	2190640	states, and you're doing this non equilibrium steady state
2190640	2194120	stuff. So when you are assuming stationarity, you're saying
2194120	2196080	like, yeah, there are these kind of regular cyclical
2196080	2199880	behaviors that I want to model, even in that context, the
2199880	2202120	free energy principle can handle path dependence, like
2202120	2205360	literally, I think on page 12 of like Carl's monograph from
2205360	2209360	2019, on the density dynamics formulations, there are already
2209360	2212280	terms that contain, you know, expressions that are able to
2212280	2215400	handle path dependency, that are basically dependent on
2215400	2218240	changes in surprise in your system. So, so
2218480	2221760	before we, before we move too far, maybe Chris, you can, you
2221760	2225120	might be able to steel man what the, the paper was trying to
2225120	2226640	say there, or
2229360	2231320	well, I'm just, I'm just, I'm trying to understand, I'm trying
2231320	2234240	to decide if I'm an inactivist, because Tim's a big fan. So I
2234240	2237480	want to, you know, give it fair judge anyone, does anybody
2237480	2240960	want to steel man, you know, where the paper might have been
2240960	2244120	coming from, in terms of this argument against
2244600	2245400	historicity?
2248360	2249760	I can straw man it if you want it.
2250200	2256520	No, I'm happy to have a go at it. But I mean, so we're a very
2256520	2261440	broad church at within this community, we we debate within
2261440	2264760	ourselves about the, you know, the true origins and how we get
2264760	2268000	these things out. So I actually was worried about this
2268000	2273040	historicity thing. In an earlier version, we did in, we
2273040	2275640	published in physics life reviews with a student, a very
2275640	2278640	talented student of mine. And we found real problems with it
2278640	2281800	when we were in a state based formulation of the system. And
2281800	2285880	I know Maxwell feels that that even in the state based
2285880	2288280	description of probability densities that we can recover
2288280	2293880	historicity, I guess we still not complete agreement on that.
2294120	2297320	But what's majorly happened in the in the free energy is this
2297320	2301280	movement to pass. And I agree with Maxwell, if you go back into
2301400	2305120	Carl's original work, talking like Carl was not here, but you're
2305120	2308800	back to Carl's original work, he was framing in terms of paths.
2308960	2312080	But the presentations in the monograph were to do to do with
2312080	2315640	states. And when we work through that, we found that the
2315640	2319720	historicity was hard to to to get back into these systems. But
2319720	2323040	the path formalization then makes it clear how historicity
2323040	2325560	because it's built into the system because you're preserving
2325720	2328360	sets of paths you go to, you know, homeoresis rather than
2328720	2331720	homeostasis in the descriptions of these systems. And then
2331720	2334400	there's this kind of nice, elegant way to deal with
2334440	2337760	historicity. And, you know, and I think so, I don't think
2337760	2341280	that's a real issue with the free energy principle. So, but I
2341280	2345080	can imagine, I don't know what technical literature they've
2345080	2347360	read. But perhaps if they've read the state based formula,
2347600	2350000	formulation, they had the same worries about those about
2350000	2353520	historicity. And if they read these new path based stuff that
2354520	2356640	Maxwell and Dalton are developing, I think those kind
2356640	2360480	of dissolve. I think that it's a much richer framework now.
2361120	2364760	So maybe Carl, what were you thinking back then when you did
2364760	2369240	it as as paths, you know, maybe just give us some some thought
2369240	2372760	behind your intuition for why you originally formulated it as
2372760	2376040	you know, path, path integrals for past systems and you know,
2376360	2379120	what your perspective is on what we've been discussing so far.
2379840	2385200	Right. I can't really remember. I suppose the obvious answer is
2385320	2388200	much of this inherits from Richard Feynman's work on the
2388200	2390280	path integral formulation. Indeed, the variational free
2390280	2395320	energy can be traced right back to I think probably is PhD
2395320	2397680	thesis. I haven't actually read the PhD thesis, but I've been
2397680	2402480	told that all the maths you need is there. So it would be
2402480	2407120	difficult for me to conceive of a calculus that wasn't framed in
2407120	2412480	terms of in terms of paths, until you start to try and draw
2412480	2416960	graphics and explain to people who are not familiar with, you
2417000	2418960	know, with the notion of, you know, with the path integral
2418960	2423040	formulation and its equivalence with density dynamics as
2423040	2426240	articulated say with the Vokker-Planck equation or I repeat
2426240	2433080	sort of Kolmogorov forward and backward equations. So I think
2433080	2439200	that is, you know, that's one really important aspect of
2439200	2444320	historicity and becomes I think even more prescient when you
2444320	2448720	think about deploying a path integral formulation of self
2448720	2452600	organisation in the context of 21st century physics, because
2452600	2456240	what we're talking about now is a move away from 20th century
2456240	2461920	equilibrium physics with pointer tractors to open systems that
2461920	2465960	are far from equilibrium. So mathematically, or one
2466000	2471000	mathematical bright line between the physics of equilibria and
2471000	2473200	the physics of non equilibria, which is what the free energy
2473240	2480040	principle is about, or specifically, when non equilibrium
2480760	2484800	city-state solutions admit a Markov blanket, but returning to
2484800	2489880	the sort of what is definitive of non equilibria, it is
2489880	2497080	effectively the, not the historicity, but the itinerancy
2497080	2501640	you get from solenoidal dynamics, sort of conservative
2501640	2506920	dynamics that now supplement the dissipative flows that
2506920	2510520	characterize completely classical physics and equilibrium
2511360	2515080	equilibria steady states. So if you wanted to define the
2515080	2519600	difference between an open system or an out of equilibrium or
2519600	2523360	non equilibrium system from an equilibrium system, the simple
2523360	2528920	kind of systems that Chris was referring to in his toy models
2528960	2531560	of your does a free energy principle work in your in this
2531560	2537200	kind of system, then all you would do is write down the
2537200	2542160	dynamics in terms of dissipative and conservative or
2542160	2548080	non-dissipative divergence free components. And that, if you
2548080	2552440	like, decomposition of the flow into conservative and
2552440	2556520	dissipative parts is just the Helmholtz decomposition is just
2556520	2559880	the fundamental number of variational calculus, I think,
2560640	2564760	or fundamental theorem, which just says that, you know, any
2564760	2570400	flow, any dynamics can always be decomposed into this sort of
2570400	2574200	gradient descent that underwrites classical physics or
2574240	2580640	equilibrium physics, and the a solenoidal divergence free flow
2580640	2584280	that underwrites classical mechanics. But you put the two
2584320	2590960	together and you have, by definition, now a mathematical
2590960	2595400	image of non equilibrium systems. And notice that in
2595400	2601160	introducing this kind of itinerancy, that is, for
2601160	2605280	example, you know, heuristically, you know, water going
2605280	2608040	down a plug hole. So the dissipative part, the gradient
2608040	2612040	flow would be the the water tumbling down into the depths
2612080	2616800	of your house. But as it circulates around, technically,
2616800	2620720	in terms of the information theory around on ISO contours,
2620720	2622920	the probability distribution, but you know, you can just
2622920	2626840	visualize the water circular, that's the solenoidal part. And
2626840	2630880	of course, when you talk about biotic self organization or
2630880	2636240	self organization, non equilibria, that has that sort of
2636240	2642360	life like our biotic form, the key characteristic of this
2642360	2645760	kind of biotic circulation is basically rhythms and life
2645760	2652400	cycles. So the very fact you're dealing with this kind of
2652680	2658600	historicity that is inherent in the itinerancy of any system
2658640	2662880	that is not at equilibrium means that you are you have to
2663000	2667400	write down or have an understanding or a mathematics
2667400	2670640	that deals with these with these flows and these life cycles.
2671240	2675240	Just one interesting twist here is if you take the randomness
2675240	2677880	out of it, if you go back to deterministic dynamical
2677880	2682320	systems of the kind, I now understand under the split or
2682320	2686120	the fork in the road in philosophy. What you do is
2686120	2688040	you're basically removing from the perspective of the
2688040	2691200	Helmholtz decomposition, the dissipative part, and you just
2691240	2694440	left with the conservative part. What is that? That's just
2694800	2697720	Newtonian mechanics. It's his classical mechanics, which is
2697720	2702280	why the sun, we rotate around the sun or the moon takes these
2702280	2707040	orbits. This is just this solenoidal flow in the limit that
2707040	2711640	you've ignored the randomness that you need that calls for the
2711640	2715280	information theoretic or probabilistic descriptions of any
2715280	2718560	world. So that the free energy principle doesn't deal with all
2718560	2723200	kinds of systems. It deals with systems that have an admixture
2723200	2726880	of both the dissipative and the solenoidal or divergence free
2726880	2729920	parts. If you wanted to just do the dissipative parts, you do
2729920	2733120	quantum mechanics. If you just wanted to do the solenoidal
2733120	2735840	part, you do classical mechanics and deterministic
2735840	2740640	systems. But in the middle, you're in the Goldilocks regime
2740640	2743840	in which you and I operate, we're talking about stochastic
2743880	2747680	chaos, basically, another description of this itinerancy.
2747920	2751080	So I think that that's that's, you know, one aspect of
2751080	2756640	historicity, which, you know, is celebrated in the physics of
2756640	2760880	self organization. And I keep using the word self organization
2760880	2765240	because I read auto poesis as self creation, or at least self
2765240	2770280	maintenance. I now appreciate it is not quite self. It's slightly
2770280	2775680	beyond self maintenance and in the sense that, you know, to
2775680	2782040	create your imply something slightly greater that maybe I'm
2782040	2784920	going to have to ask Chris, it may be related to operational
2784920	2789160	closure. So I'd like to if somebody just describe for me and
2789160	2791960	the audience when operational closure is that would be quite
2791960	2796400	nice. But before you do, there is another important aspect of
2796400	2800640	historicity, which we haven't mentioned, which inherits from
2801400	2805120	the deployment of the free energy principle, or perhaps
2805160	2809560	just the Helmholtz decomposition in using the apparatus of the
2809560	2812680	renormalization group. And what that brings to the table is a
2812680	2816080	separation of temporal scales. And as soon as you have that in
2816080	2819840	play, there's a different kind of historicity, which you have to
2819840	2823000	accommodate in any given calculus, certainly for open
2823000	2828120	systems, which means that the kind of steady state solutions
2828160	2830920	that are non equilibrium set solutions, we are talking about
2831560	2836040	in the context of a pathological formulation only exist over a
2836040	2839680	certain timescale. There's always a timescale above that
2839680	2842840	contextualizes it. And there's always a timescale below that is
2842840	2846760	much, much faster, where things live for very, very short
2846760	2849720	periods of time. I think that's another important aspect of
2849720	2852680	historicity that we're not talking about a unique or
2852680	2855560	privileged timescale here. So when people talk about
2855600	2863280	stationarity, or ergodicity, or steady states, they, you know,
2863280	2868200	one cannot say that this is the configuration of a system at
2868200	2873360	equals infinity. Because you have to acknowledge that there is no
2873360	2876960	privileged timescales at this timescale, we will assume that
2876960	2880920	is a state solution. But we have to be very explicit is at this
2880920	2884440	timescale. And this does not apply at the timescale above, or
2884520	2887880	at all the timescale below. And interestingly, just
2887880	2891800	mathematically, perhaps a naive mathematical or certainly a
2891800	2894960	physicist's mathematical perspective, and the very fact
2894960	2898400	you have the separation of timescale basically means that
2898400	2902360	there are fast, there's fast stuff for fast dynamics and slow
2902360	2908200	dynamics. And at the end of the day, if you now consider what is
2908200	2912000	the difference between the flow of states that you would find in
2912040	2917160	deterministic, deterministic dynamical system, and the random
2917160	2921240	fluctuations that convert it into a random dynamical system, the
2921240	2924040	only difference between these things is whether they're fast or
2924040	2927880	slow. So you can treat the random fluctuations, the noise that
2927880	2931080	induces a probabilistic description, and all the
2931080	2936680	information theoretic treatments, as simply the fast things, and
2936680	2941480	everything else is the slow stuff. So again, speaking to, if
2941480	2947880	you like, an almost necessary connection between any dynamical
2947880	2952160	systems formulation that is sufficiently liberal to include
2952160	2955960	fast and slow stuff, and probabilistic treatments of that
2956000	2960520	of the kind that Richard Feynman pursued in terms of trying to
2960520	2962920	work out the probability of the path of the small particle or
2962920	2967200	electron for his PhD thesis. Anyway, what is operational
2967200	2967840	closure?
2968040	2973520	So just go up a definition from Varela, if you want me to read
2973520	2973880	it out.
2974320	2977440	Can I just frame you up there, Chris? Because in that forking
2977440	2980520	paper, there was I actually thought it was a little bit
2981040	2984560	hand wavy. It's not like in graph theory, where you have very
2984560	2988840	kind of precise definition. So they had a they had a kind of a
2988840	2992520	node diagram. And they said it was operationally closed if all
2992520	2995440	of the black colored nodes had one arrow going out and
2995440	2998080	connecting to another one. And they had a kind of diagram
2998080	3002040	just showing an organism. But what's the official definition,
3002040	3002320	Chris?
3003120	3006160	Yeah, so this is a definition from Varela, as an autonomous
3006160	3009480	system is that is that organization is characterized by
3009480	3012960	processes such that the processes are related as a network, so
3012960	3015480	that recursively depend on each other in the generation
3015480	3018960	realization of the processes themselves. And two, they
3018960	3023120	constitute the system as a unity, recognizable in space, in
3023120	3025400	which those processes exist. So it's kind of this deep
3025400	3029720	recursive recursivity between the processes, maintaining the
3029720	3032280	network is necessary for the processes, this kind of
3032280	3035960	generation of the system's own constraints. I guess this has
3035960	3039080	been it's always been the kind of slightly ineffable within the
3039080	3041720	auto put it literature, what this means formally, right?
3041720	3043680	There's a deep intuition. This is correct. You know, you think
3043680	3048720	about, as Keith said before, we the matter is changing as as
3048720	3051600	fluxes changing these processes, but the identity is
3051720	3054480	somehow staying the same. And that's the organizational
3054480	3056880	structure that's maintained over time, rather than the
3056880	3061280	material components of that, that structure. And I do think
3061280	3065400	you know, that there is a sense that was when we did focus on
3065400	3068520	these state based descriptions of the free energy principle, I
3068520	3073280	think that kind of undersold the solenoidal flow that Carl was
3073280	3076040	talking about, whereas that is, I think it's much more
3076040	3079400	important to the people in in auto poise is because this notion
3079760	3082680	of this kind of flow of information and the organization
3082680	3086160	is dynamic within the equilibrium is important for for that
3086160	3088720	field. So I think the you know, the new directions they've got
3088760	3090960	in the free energy principle things that Maxwell and Dalton
3090960	3095040	are pursuing is to me an exciting opportunity to kind of
3095040	3097920	reconcile some of the ineffability of these operational
3097920	3102240	closure ideas in auto poise and this framework, essentially.
3105640	3106520	Cool, cool. So
3106800	3109480	Maxwell, do you want to do you want to comment maybe briefly on
3109480	3113360	that before we move on? Like Chris, Chris called out some of
3113360	3114800	your work there with Dalton?
3115520	3118360	Yeah, I mean, in a good way, though, I think what Chris is
3118360	3121120	saying is that he agrees with the direction. I would just say
3121120	3123560	that this isn't really new work. And this says that you would
3123560	3126480	Dalton and I are just doing is extending work that Carl did
3126480	3131600	20 almost 20 years ago. So I see this as more continuous. You
3131600	3134880	know, someone might say that I'm being overly generous, which I
3134880	3137720	might be, you know, by looking at this as like one kind of
3137720	3143320	continuous development. But yeah, I don't really, I think, you
3143320	3146240	know, you can think of the state based description as sort of
3146240	3149640	the asymptotic limit of the path based description, the two are
3149640	3157440	kind of like deeply connected in some sense. So no, I mean, I
3157440	3160040	think this is real, this is the direction that we want to go.
3160120	3162560	There's still some interesting stuff that you can say using the
3162560	3167160	density dynamics formulation. We just have to be you know, it's
3167160	3172280	like we were discussing Keith during our MLST interview last
3172280	3176760	time, this is mind physics, right? So, you know, a hallmark of
3176800	3181120	physics is idealization. And so, you know, necessarily some of
3181120	3184080	these constructs are going to be, you know, the map has to be
3184080	3186320	simpler than the territory, it's like we were saying, right?
3186360	3189680	You know, otherwise, you get you wind up in a boar has novel
3189680	3192680	with like, you know, a map the size of Los Angeles that you
3192680	3197600	can't use. So, you know, for certain kinds of oscillatory
3197600	3201400	cyclical bio behaviors, the non equilibrium steady state is a
3201400	3209360	perfectly fine, you know, model of it. You know, I drink coffee so
3209360	3212680	regularly that it might as well be like, you know, deterministic
3212680	3216840	and like, you know, orbiting the sun kind of thing. So, you
3216840	3219440	know, this speaks to the fact that the free energy principle
3219440	3222960	is what it says on the tin, it's a principle. It's a it's a that
3222960	3227160	leads to a modeling method. And you know, we make some
3227160	3231720	assumptions, and we're able to say some things. But the principle
3231720	3235440	itself doesn't rest on any of these assumptions. Like
3235440	3238480	stationarity, for example, like you don't really need that to
3238480	3241000	get it to get it working. All you need is a markup like it in
3241000	3244640	your random dynamical system and you're sort of ready to go. In
3244640	3248880	terms of like the formalization of the inactive approach, I
3248920	3253080	always saw this. So, like Chris, by the way, I think this is
3253320	3256880	under, I don't talk about it very much, but much like Chris, I
3256880	3260920	started off recalcitrant to the free energy principle. I found
3260920	3265160	out about this stuff in around 2014. And it, you know, like I
3265160	3268640	said, I was trained as an inactivist. And this really
3268640	3273640	conflicted with my intuitions. And I went into this thinking I
3273640	3277000	need to and this is also what I think the spirit that motivates
3277000	3279600	a lot of criticism, you go into this thinking I need to
3279600	3283040	understand this just enough to be able to know for sure that I
3283040	3286640	don't need to understand this actually. And, you know, you go
3286640	3290240	into this. And I, you know, I remember having like a conversion
3290240	3296120	experience reading Carl's 2012 entropy paper called a free
3296120	3299760	energy principle for biological systems, which was a path based
3299800	3302320	kind of formulation and everything and really, you know,
3302320	3306760	seeing, oh, wow, like, there's no, there's no resisting this,
3306760	3309760	like this is inevitable. And really getting like, oh, yeah,
3309760	3312440	this is an inevitable consequence of physics, isn't it? Like
3312440	3316000	there's no, there's no getting around this. And then kind of,
3316000	3319400	you know, doubling down in my conversion and then becoming a
3319400	3320440	part of the community.
3321000	3324280	So what's funny is I had the opposite experience of you two. So
3324280	3327240	I when I first saw it, I'm like, this is amazing. Like this is
3327240	3331080	exactly how it works. And now I've been trying to escape ever
3331120	3334440	since, you know, I don't like being shackled, like to the free
3334440	3337080	energy principle. And funny enough, we've talked before about
3337080	3339960	how, you know, Carl, that the free energy principle is one of
3339960	3344080	the few principles that applies to itself. It's like, as simple as
3344080	3347320	it is, it can be and still and still work. The other aspect in
3347320	3350400	which that's true is, as we've been talking about it maintains
3350400	3354080	this flexibility, or maybe vagueness, you know, critics
3354080	3357240	might say, but it maintains this flexibility, which leads to
3357240	3360680	it inevitably generating all kinds of controversy and debates,
3360680	3363440	you know, and people arguing about like the limits of that
3363440	3364560	flexibility, right?
3364920	3368480	One thing I would quickly point out is like, there's this
3368480	3371480	sense, I think in the literature that there are like 17
3371480	3373520	different possible interpretations of the free
3373520	3376120	energy principle, and that you can make it say one thing and
3376120	3379440	it's opposite. What I've been going around saying is no, that's
3379440	3382920	not correct. There's only the free energy principle. And it has
3382920	3386800	the implications that it does. And there are misinterpretations
3386800	3390560	of the free energy principle. So for example, you know, I
3390560	3393680	think this idea that some people in the literature have been
3394000	3397320	pushing that like the free energy principle is even compatible
3397320	3401120	with this kind of radical anti realism, this kind of, you
3401120	3405320	know, like a Descartes demon kind of thing. That's not that
3405320	3408280	just doesn't follow. It's incompatible with the math, like
3408280	3411240	the you need, you need there to be an actual world out there to
3411240	3414120	couple to you for the math to get off the ground. So there there
3414120	3416600	actually isn't a bunch of different interpretations. There's
3416600	3419840	just the free energy principle. It's just that it's a lens that
3419840	3423600	makes you makes you see that a lot of the dichotomies that use
3423600	3427160	to structure the way we think about things are false. This
3427160	3429360	comes back to the thing that we were discussing at the end of
3429360	3433920	our interview, Keith. This is sort of like a, you know, you're
3433920	3435960	sort of abolishing the distinction between the
3435960	3439960	super lunar re and the sub lunar spheres, right? So classical
3439960	3444520	mechanics abolishes the distinction that was popular
3444520	3449600	as scholastic philosophy, which was, you know, like 1000, 1500
3449600	3454360	years of like, you know, natural philosophy saying, well, I mean,
3454360	3457080	if you look at the way things behave, the things out there
3457080	3460920	beyond the moon in the super lunar sphere, right, they move in
3460920	3465160	perfect orbits, perfect circles, seems to have nothing to do
3465160	3469000	with, you know, things here that fall to the ground or rise and
3469000	3471720	have a beginning, a middle and an end. These seem like
3471720	3475800	radically distinct spheres of reality. But then Newton comes
3475800	3478720	along and classical mechanics equips you with a set of
3478720	3482560	equations that apply equally to things here and things over
3482560	3486360	there, thereby just abolishing that distinction. And I think
3486360	3489160	like the free energy principle comes around and does undoes a
3489160	3491760	lot of these false dichotomies in the same way, like we were
3491760	3495240	talking about internalism versus externalism, it allows you to
3495240	3497600	say, yeah, there's something to the internalist story, the
3497600	3499840	internal states are doing something special, but you
3499840	3502840	actually need the external world to be there to get the story to
3502840	3507560	kind of pick up. So I think you get a lot of this. And I guess
3507560	3511680	my hot tag is that the inactivists need there to
3511680	3515760	be a bright line in the universe, like a bright red line on the
3515760	3519520	one. And then what's on each side of the line depends on the
3519520	3522680	inactivists, right? So like, but the story is always something
3522680	3525920	like there's physics, there's mere physics on one side. And
3525920	3528000	then there's the interesting stuff on the other side, there's
3528000	3531360	biology, or maybe there's mind or there's something like that.
3531360	3534640	And there is this bright red line, like, yeah.
3535640	3538720	So Max, Maxwell is saying the free energy principle is the
3538720	3541080	ultimate shade of gray. I hope you
3543160	3545760	know, I know Tim, Tim, we wanted to move to a new topic.
3546600	3548960	Yeah, yeah, I mean, there's there's a few things to touch on
3548960	3552760	there. I mean, certainly the philosophy of, you know, an
3552760	3555840	activism versus ecological psychology is an interesting one
3555840	3559680	because with an activism, we get quite a few philosophical
3559680	3564400	things bagged on that possibly we may or may not want, for
3564400	3568240	example, the phenomenology, the existentialism, which is this
3568240	3571240	idea that you can shape your own experience, this kind of
3571240	3574040	Eastern philosophy, which is that in some sense, there's no
3574040	3578080	distinction between you and your environment. And it has been
3578080	3582080	criticized as being quite ill defined and vague. But I think
3582080	3584800	Maxwell, you have said that there's much more of a tighter
3584920	3589240	compatibility with ecological psychology. And that's essentially
3589240	3592720	that we see the world through affordances. And what that means
3592760	3597040	is that we see the world as trajectories of actions in our
3597040	3601000	physical environment that we live in. And philosophically,
3601000	3603600	that's a realist ontology. So that means there are no
3603600	3606400	representations, we're taking actions in the real world, and
3606400	3610760	we know that the real world exists. And now many cognitive
3610760	3612960	science people, of course, resist to this notion because they
3612960	3616640	say we need to have representations. And then we get to
3616640	3619560	this interesting discussion that we're having about this kind
3619880	3623240	of continuum between this idea that on the one hand, there are
3623240	3626360	no representations if we are Gibsonian, and we are
3626360	3631800	ecological psychologists. But on the other hand, we might need
3631800	3634720	to have increasing levels of representation if we actually
3634720	3639120	have this temporal depth, if we have these nested Markov
3639120	3641960	boundaries, and we are sophisticated minds that are
3642120	3645320	making predictions into the future. Now with that laid out, I
3645320	3649320	wanted to talk about this notion of goals. Now in a
3649600	3653640	externalist and activist framework, I think that goals
3653640	3657320	are not something we should explicitly define. Now when you
3657320	3659760	speak with go fi people, and they talk about building
3659760	3662520	cognitive architectures, they say that goals should be
3662680	3665520	explicitly crafted into the architecture, at least that's
3665520	3668040	what they would have said 20 years ago, now they're slightly
3668040	3671600	more refined. And they say, Well, we should have a goal module
3671600	3674520	in the architecture, but the goals should be acquired
3674760	3679200	empirically, and there should be sub goals and so on. Now, if I
3679200	3681200	understand correctly, we were just talking about the free
3681200	3684600	energy principle has this notion of paths, and we have
3684600	3690080	beliefs over trajectories of actions into the future. And to
3690080	3695600	what extent is a belief a goal? Because if you have an almost
3695600	3699800	infinite number of beliefs, so there's a trajectory to this
3699800	3703880	future state where I'm rich, but there's also an infinitude of
3703880	3707280	other potential trajectories. And they are of course constrained
3707280	3710520	by the physical affordances and trajectories that I can take in
3710520	3714680	my physical environment. That seems different to having an
3714680	3718880	intention of wanting to be rich or wanting to play tennis,
3719040	3722840	because I'm constrained in all of these different ways. So yeah,
3722840	3725960	why don't we just talk about the dichotomy between beliefs and
3725960	3726640	goals?
3727600	3731720	I think Karl or Chris would be better equipped to answer the
3731720	3733960	latter question. Karl in particular has been thinking
3733960	3738000	about intentional behavior quite deeply recently. I did want to
3738000	3743360	quickly comment upon ecological psychology. I have been saying
3743400	3747160	to the eco psych community that Bayesian mechanics and eco
3747160	3750520	psych are the same discipline. They're really the same thing.
3751240	3755800	Vicente Raja is one of the cooler, more technically
3755800	3760280	proficient people in the eco psych community. And after a few
3760280	3763040	years of back and forth, we've realized that yeah, we're using
3763040	3766320	exactly the same set of mathematical tools. The only
3766320	3770160	framing is the only difference is a philosophical framing is, are
3770160	3775000	you an indirectist or a directist? Right? So and I happen to
3775000	3777880	think that these are just kind of semantic quibbles. If you look
3777920	3781480	at the more contemporary eco psych literature, so the eco
3781480	3785640	psych people are tend to be much more sophisticated, technically
3785640	3788800	than the inactive people. And one thing that they have in
3788800	3791440	common is that they don't reject information theory out of
3791440	3794600	hand. They want the richer notion of information, like
3794600	3798080	ecological information or semantic information, some kind
3798080	3801800	of information that has some relevance to the environment,
3802120	3806760	you know, the organisms like Melia, it's umvelt, it's, it's
3807480	3811160	world of life. But they're not rejecting information theory. In
3811160	3815400	fact, Gibson's original ambition was to apply physics to the
3815400	3819240	study of perception just straight up. You know, so it's
3819240	3822560	all about like, you know, energy, the, the energy on the
3822560	3826040	perceptual arrays and all of this stuff. It's essentially, I
3826040	3829360	think, the same project from a methodological and
3829360	3832640	mathematical perspective. The main difference is just an
3832640	3836080	inactive and a an ecological psychologist, sorry, would say
3836080	3840480	that we perceive things directly. But then they appeal to
3840480	3844000	this, these notions of like resonance and whatever, which
3844000	3847600	you know, to us is just synonym for inference. I guess
3847600	3852200	it's like it, the difference rests in like, are you centering
3852200	3855760	on the internal perspective of an organism? Or are you looking
3855760	3859120	at things as a multi scale stack with the organism kind of
3859120	3863000	carving out one level? So we had a great session actually with
3863000	3868400	Michael Anderson's Emerge Lab group, based out of Ontario. And
3868600	3874600	my, my gut tells me that there will be a kind of strategic
3874600	3878520	alliance, and maybe even just a merging of these two fields,
3879200	3883920	moving forward. Yeah, and you know, for the more cynical part
3883920	3887680	of me thinks that the merger of free energy principle and
3887680	3890320	ecosystem gives you everything that you might want out of
3890360	3894360	inactivism, but without any of the, you know, heavy, kind of
3894360	3897360	metaphysical or philosophical baggage that seems to be, you
3897360	3902240	know, hindering progress in that field. So that's my thing
3902240	3903600	about eco psych.
3906040	3910160	Okay, maybe we can bring you Chris in on the goals thing. So
3910160	3914040	is, is a goal in end state? Is it a trajectory? Is it a
3914040	3919080	bearing? And is it, is it, does it exist explicitly in the
3919120	3920760	externalist view of cognition?
3921600	3924760	Well, so I'm a kind of more of a practical, computational
3924760	3928280	person. So I'll leave the philosophy to Maxwell. But I
3928280	3931000	mean, I tend to take the intentional stats, intentional
3931000	3934160	standards on systems, where if we can, if it makes sense for us
3934160	3937840	to describe a system as a goal directed, then we should do so.
3937840	3941160	And if that helps engineers to build those systems, then they
3941160	3945360	they should do so, right? But there's a nice kind of, there's
3945360	3948600	a nice parallel between those are kind of ideas and the original
3948640	3950400	working cybernetics. So there's the, you know, the good
3950400	3953760	regulator theorem, which this kind of early work by Conan and
3953760	3956560	Ashby suggests that any, any control system of a given
3956560	3959720	environment is a good model of the environment that it controls
3959720	3963880	just by by necessity from first principles, right? Which to me,
3963880	3966800	which we suggest that we should, in principle, be able to
3966800	3970880	describe an intentional structure in terms of the kind of
3970880	3973800	generative model within within a system, we should be able to
3973800	3976960	find it if it is a good control system, and it should exist. I
3976960	3979680	think there's also a more practical thing about shifting
3979680	3983320	from the notion of reward as this kind of potential function
3983320	3986200	that's kind of dominated the machine learning area, right? So
3986200	3988440	we have this kind of monolithic thing of reward and everything
3988440	3992240	is in in service of that reward to a richer notion of beliefs
3992240	3995760	about dynamics, which which which affords that kind of, you
3995760	3997880	know, moves away that potential function to a more kind of
3998120	4000800	dynamical system so we can get more kind of rich beliefs about
4000800	4004120	future trajectories and so on. And we know that in control
4004120	4006360	systems, that's really, it's really important, right? If we
4006360	4009560	want to control a system, we're doing model based control, we
4009560	4011640	have to have desires on the futures of those systems, we need
4011640	4014360	to understand the trajectory and the divergence of the
4014360	4016760	trajectories over through time, right? So I think it's a much
4016760	4021440	richer picture, practically, to think about, you know, beliefs
4021480	4025080	about dynamics rather than reward. And I think there's this
4025080	4027120	nice parallel between the intentional structure and the
4027120	4029160	good regulator theory, because I think the good regulator
4029160	4032200	theorem entails that we should find those kind of intentional
4032200	4035760	dynamics within our systems, right? With just by a priori
4035760	4036480	first reasoning.
4036960	4038800	Yeah, I just want to know if he could explain the good
4038800	4040400	regulator theorem, because I think that
4040440	4043440	Yes, the good regulator theorem is really strong resonances
4043440	4045720	with this. And I think, you know, there was a long, there was a
4045720	4049080	long time, not Carl, the Carl's exclusive. It's a long time
4049080	4051800	the people who were reading the free energy literature to think
4051800	4054240	that they're kind of the roots of the free energy principle was
4054240	4057160	in Helmholtz, Helmholtzian perception, right, this notion
4057160	4059920	of Bayesian inference and perception. But there's kind of
4059920	4063760	a much richer reading to see its roots in cybernetics movement,
4063920	4066400	and particularly by the works of people like Ross Ashby and so
4066400	4070440	on. So he basically said, he provided this theorem that
4070440	4073400	showed that if you want to build a regulator for a given
4073400	4075960	environmental system that optimally regulates that
4075960	4080200	system, then it necessitates that regulator is a good model of
4080200	4083600	that system, right? And there's a kind of you can take that in a
4083600	4087040	strong way and a weak way and we worried about this for a long
4087040	4091040	time. But just to diffuse that from its representational kind
4091040	4093360	of implications, which we worried about for a long time, you
4093360	4095720	can see this in something like even like the Watt-Gubner, which
4095720	4098920	is used as his classic inactivist system that doesn't is
4098920	4103080	nonrepresentationalist. But there are kind of there's a sense in
4103080	4105400	which the dynamics of the Watt-Gubner needs to mirror the
4105400	4108080	fluctuations of the the sea management regulating and it's
4108080	4111680	that kind of coupling and that kind of reflection of those
4111680	4114880	dynamics, which is important for the regulation of that system,
4114880	4118480	right? So that kind of you can back out that, you know, I think
4118480	4120760	this is very nice to line with the intentional stance and it
4120800	4124600	demands an intentional stance. If you if you if you if you if
4124600	4126520	you're committed to this notion of the good regulator,
4126520	4126840	Ferriam.
4126880	4130400	To riff on your point of the intentional son, I think that
4130400	4132760	that's a fascinating way of looking at it, Chris. And to
4132760	4136200	bring you in, Professor, Professor Daniel Dennett had
4136200	4140560	this notion of the intentional stance, that when we, you know,
4140560	4144600	we essentially have a mental model of the intentions of other
4144600	4147800	agents. And we use that to understand their behavior. And
4147800	4151320	an intention is a goal. If you think about it, it's something
4151320	4155600	I want to do. But in this dynamical systems framework,
4155600	4159680	it's not explicitly coded anywhere, it kind of emerges. And
4159680	4162800	of course, it's a subjective state. So we've spoken about
4163000	4167160	mental phenomenal states being encoded in our generative
4167160	4172160	model in our in our free energy framework. And those states will
4172160	4177000	of course have intentional, you know, representations of the
4177040	4181840	other agents that we're dealing with. So I guess, the question
4181840	4184080	back to you, Professor, for instance, how do you goals
4184080	4187040	kind of get encoded in in this dynamics?
4189560	4192520	Yeah, that's a great question. I know the answer you want,
4192520	4194160	because you don't like goals, do you?
4198480	4200840	I don't mind if they're I guess, I guess the answer is they're
4200840	4202800	emergent, which is, which is
4203040	4206640	exactly what I was hoping for that. Yes, they have to, you
4206640	4211320	know, you have to find a physics where it looks as if there are
4211320	4214640	goals, and they emerge from a particular kind of self
4214640	4217480	organization. I think that's that's been beautifully
4217480	4221080	illustrated just in the previous conversations you've had. And
4221360	4228440	you know, ranging from the work of Ross Ashby on his homey
4228440	4230800	stat, which I think would be better nowadays called an
4230800	4234160	alofstat, but it would be to stick with the homey stat. Of
4234160	4237920	course, you know, does homeostasis have a goal? Does my
4237920	4240520	physiology have the goal of maintaining my temperature at
4240520	4244400	37 degrees centigrade? It certainly looks like that. Do I
4244400	4248800	intend to do that? Well, I think on one reading of intention,
4248800	4254160	yes, you know, and certainly on an alofstatic reading of
4255000	4258600	behaviors that have this temporal depth and are the
4258600	4263880	consequence of plans into the future, you're putting turning
4263880	4267720	on the thermostat or putting on clothes. I think then you're
4267720	4270960	getting much closer to this sort of more anthropomorphic notion
4271000	4274520	of intentionality, whether I think there are girls, there are
4274560	4281240	there are endpoints. And so I guess that the question then is,
4281280	4284240	you know, at what point would these different kinds of
4284240	4288040	intentionality or goal directed behavior emerge from
4288280	4294160	self organization? And in what particular kinds of systems would
4294160	4297760	you expect to see this these these these behaviors? I think
4297760	4300520	there's some fairly straightforward answers from the
4300520	4304240	point of view of the physicist, not not the philosopher. So if
4304240	4309640	you just look at the different kinds of systems that you could
4309640	4314920	apply the free energy principle to, we've talked about one of
4314920	4318800	them right at the beginning, when considering Markov
4318800	4322760	blankets that did not have any have any internal states, for
4322760	4326560	example, a stone. Yeah, so every state of this thing is just a
4326560	4329400	Markov blanket, and it is in reciprocal exchange with the
4329400	4333920	external states. So that would be when the internal states are
4333920	4337280	empty. Well, there are other kinds of systems that you could
4337280	4339400	have. Well, you could imagine systems that didn't have any
4339400	4344680	active states. But, you know, most interesting systems do
4344680	4348720	have active states. And then you ask about the rounded
4348720	4352240	contribution of these random fluctuations to the dynamics of
4352240	4355640	you know, the self organization. And if you just follow the
4355640	4362080	maths through the pathogenical, in particular, maths of the
4362800	4366600	dynamics that any system at a particular temporal scale must
4366600	4372400	have, if it's internal or autonomous dynamics, or the
4372440	4376240	dynamics, the flows of the internal states and the
4376760	4379360	the blanket states that constitute a particle or a person,
4379600	4384160	when they become sufficiently precise. So when we become big
4384160	4390080	enough, and cool enough, so let's assume that we're bigger than
4390080	4393200	a quantum scale, but not too big to become classical. So we're
4393200	4396720	not the size of the moon, but we are roughly your size and my
4396720	4401080	size, or perhaps the size of a mouse or an insect through to an
4401080	4405480	elephant or a giraffe. Then you have this interesting
4405480	4408320	situation of these very precise dynamics, and they're precise
4408320	4411000	just because we are big. So all the random fluctuations are
4411000	4415480	averaged away. In this particular case, then you can
4416000	4419520	you can show that these particular kinds of things or
4419520	4423360	Markov blankets have a very well defined probability
4423360	4426960	distribution over paths into the future, specifically the
4426960	4430040	paths of the active states. So let's assume that there are
4430040	4434240	certain kinds of particles or creatures that have active
4434240	4439200	states and they have, you know, they and the blanket states
4439200	4443360	enshroud a sufficient number of internal states. What would
4443440	4446800	they look like if they had very precise dynamics? Well, you can
4446800	4449120	actually work out the probability distribution over the
4449120	4452440	active states that over their actions, over their movements,
4452440	4454120	and these could be physiological movements,
4454360	4457200	autonomic reflexes, they could be physical movements, eye
4457200	4461560	movements, or for ambulatory movements, indeed even talking.
4463080	4468400	And it transpires that the probability distribution over
4468400	4472680	these particular paths of active states has an interesting
4472680	4476080	functional form when written in terms of the potential of the
4476080	4480400	log probability, we call that an expected free energy. And that
4480400	4485480	expected free energy, when you just write it down, passes into
4485480	4491040	or come can be decomposed into things that people have been
4491040	4497240	dealing with for centuries, specifically, the expected
4497240	4501840	information gain, and the expected reward or utility where
4502000	4510080	reward or utility is scored by the log probability of occupying
4510080	4513560	an attractive state or rewarding state. And I use the word
4513600	4518080	attractive state deliberately because it is just part of the
4518080	4525200	pullback attractor that affords the application of the
4525200	4528920	pathological formulation. It's just the characteristic states
4528920	4532720	and this kind of thing occupies. So the the guleness, if you
4532720	4540560	like, is is inherent in the characteristics of the particle
4540560	4544120	or person that you're trying to describe. So for certain kinds
4544120	4547600	of particles or persons, then it will certainly look as if they
4547600	4553160	are acting with long term vision, namely planning in a way to
4553400	4557000	return themselves to their attracting set, which you could
4557000	4562120	look you could now regard as a goal or a rewarded or at least
4562120	4569640	an attracting an attracting outcome or or state of being. So I
4569640	4574920	think that kind of particle starts to now show the the deep
4574960	4578560	intention, you know, it looks as if they are they are doing this
4578560	4581840	because they intend some outcome. I think the next step,
4581840	4584080	though, which is the one that you were speaking to possibly done
4584080	4588600	then it was implying is another, I think, step, which is, but
4588600	4592560	does the does the internal state know that? You know, am I
4592560	4597840	aware that I am planning? And of course, that calls upon very,
4597840	4602760	very sophisticated, so if they exist, internal or generative
4602760	4607640	models that entail a model of me and the hypothesis that all of
4607640	4612040	this, these sensations and all the consequences of my actions,
4612040	4618720	which I am not aware of. You know, I cannot feel all the
4620400	4625240	sensory, not sensory, all the neuronal impulses that cause my
4625240	4628680	muscles to contract. All I can register is the consequences of
4628680	4632320	that through my muscle, my stretch receptors, my proprioceptive
4632320	4637120	receptors, or if it's in my gut or my autonomic intraceptive
4637560	4642520	receptors. So I don't know what I'm I can't I can't have I do
4642520	4646600	have have no access to my actual action. But I can see the
4646600	4651000	consequences of it and it looks as if I'm planning. So I now have
4651040	4656600	a hypothesis or a fantasy that I am a thing. And I seem to have
4656600	4661200	goals. And if I can learn the kinds of goals that I have, then I
4661200	4666320	can now start to mentalize and have notions in my generative
4666320	4670000	model about my goals. And then I can notice, oh, you have goals,
4670120	4672800	or perhaps it's the other way around. Perhaps the first of all,
4672960	4675840	it looks as if the explanation for this random dynamical system
4675840	4680400	over here called mom is actually, but she looks as if she
4680400	4684720	plans, it looks as if she has goals. And then a few years later,
4684720	4687200	if I develop a sense of self, well, perhaps I'm a thing like
4687200	4690880	mom, but perhaps I have goals. So I think that you're, you're
4691200	4694600	from the point of view of Dandenit's intentional stance, I
4694600	4698280	think we're talking about a very, very particular kind of system
4699280	4703320	that actually has this capacity to recognize, first of all,
4703480	4708080	intentional like behaviors, long term planning dynamics in other
4708120	4712640	things, or things like itself, and then actually transcribe that
4712640	4715400	and test the hypothesis, well, perhaps I'm a thing like that as
4715400	4716880	well. Perhaps I'm me.
4719400	4721960	And what's beautiful about what you just said there, and all
4721960	4724440	three of you have said this in different different ways. So I
4724440	4727120	want to dwell on this just a bit, because I think it's a source
4727120	4730640	of the misunderstanding and or controversy about the free
4730640	4733960	energy principles. So earlier Maxwell, you had said, you know,
4733960	4738040	it's really a model about the couplings and the isolations
4738040	4740880	together, the couplings and the decouplings and the dynamics
4740880	4745920	between them. You know, Carl, you just said, systems will behave
4745960	4749760	as if they had intentions, whether or not they really have
4749760	4752960	intentions or not is kind of a different philosophical question,
4752960	4756440	but they'll behave as if they had intentions. And Chris, you
4756440	4759320	brought up, you know, the watt governor, which is, it's, it's
4759320	4762520	obviously a very simple dynamic system, you know, spinning
4762520	4766480	centrifuge and, you know, arm bar, like whatever else. And yet,
4766840	4770160	it's, it's not as though it's a literal model in the sense that
4770160	4773080	I'm going to have a mathematical, mathematical model for what
4773080	4777720	the steam engine is doing, but it's behaving as if it were an
4777720	4780400	effective model of the steam engine, because hey, when it's
4780400	4783720	slightly out of sync, the arm flexes a little bit, it readjust
4783720	4786920	it's, you know, the spin changes slightly, things continue to
4786920	4791080	work because if it didn't have the dynamics that were as if it
4791080	4794080	had a model, the thing wouldn't function, would just fall apart.
4794080	4796720	So I guess what we're all, what's all being said here is that
4797280	4801960	systems at different scales will behave as if they had a model,
4801960	4805840	even if they don't necessarily have a model in the sense of a
4805840	4809760	person, like a person might have a conscious model from which
4809760	4813320	they develop a plan or whatnot, but all these systems of varying
4813320	4817680	scales and complexity still behave as if they had a model. They
4817680	4822000	act to minimize the free energy as a consequence of, you know,
4822000	4824960	being random dynamical systems that are self maintaining.
4826440	4828720	Yeah, I think that's really eloquently put. And actually,
4828720	4831520	that's this is this to kind of underwrite some of the worries
4831520	4834960	we had about the principle, when we first started walking on
4835000	4839080	working on it as kind of coming from an activist or a low road
4839080	4841760	an activist, this notion of kind of an explicit
4841760	4844440	representationalism that you can you can get in these models
4844440	4847720	where the model is a homomorphic with the environment, right?
4847720	4850480	And I just just it rankles people who've come from behavior
4850480	4852960	based robotics and stuff like this. But then to kind of
4853160	4856240	realize that there's a richer relationship between the
4856240	4859120	internal thing, external that's been mirrored, right? It
4859120	4862560	doesn't have to be this homomorphic mapping. And also,
4862720	4865720	the you know, the actions are deeply involved in carving out
4865720	4868840	the world that you represent, you live in your own vault. You're
4868840	4871200	a model of your own vault, you're a model of regulating your
4871200	4873720	own vault, which is not, you know, it's not just like this
4873720	4877400	static separation of the of the agent from its environment,
4877400	4880280	there's this deep coupling, which, which can, you know, which
4880280	4883640	these kind of mirrorings emerge from. But yeah, I think you
4883640	4884840	articulated it really well there.
4886360	4886960	Can we just
4886960	4889040	I saw Carl, any comments here?
4891400	4894080	No, I think you did a great job. I agree with Chris, like that.
4894080	4894360	Yeah.
4896280	4899360	So I think we've got about 15 minutes left. So we'll do two
4899360	4901960	more topics. We'll end on structural learning and the
4901960	4904880	practical implementations of the free energy principle. But I
4904880	4906800	just wanted to touch on what you were talking about earlier,
4906800	4909280	Maxwell, which is this notion of the boundaries being
4909480	4912200	potentially vague, or maybe even observer relative. Now, in
4912200	4916200	your multi scale paper, you did say, use the word ontological
4916200	4921280	boundaries, I think. And I also wanted to talk about meaning. So
4921280	4925400	there's the boundaries of cognition in the physical
4925400	4927560	world. So we have this dynamical system, and it kind of
4927560	4931320	converges and we've got these nested kind of hierarchy of
4931320	4935160	boundaries. But then in a kind of Dennett sense, meaning
4935200	4938680	emerges gradually and the meaning kind of depends on your
4938680	4943120	perspective. And the intentional stance also depends on your
4943160	4946280	perspective. So different agents could look at different
4946280	4948920	phenomena going on in their physical environment, and they
4948920	4952600	could describe different meaning in their generative models. So
4952600	4955960	we seem to have this kind of weird two tier system where no
4955960	4958560	longer are we even saying that the boundaries, the marker
4958560	4961800	boundaries are fixed, they are potentially variable. And then
4961800	4965520	the way that the agents construct meaning is also
4965520	4969280	observer dependent. And all of this is kind of touching on what
4969280	4972320	I was saying before with goals, which is that the reason they
4972320	4975840	emerge is because they are unintelligible, they're extremely
4975840	4981240	complex. Do you see what I mean? So it feels like the reason why
4981240	4983760	we need to have this high resolution generative model is
4983760	4986440	because in principle, it would be impossible for us to
4986440	4987760	explicitly program it.
4992800	4996560	So a few quick things about that. I mean, I think you're
4996560	5001240	you're really identifying some of the key issues. I would first
5001240	5006920	so with respect to ontology, I would, you know, distinguish
5006960	5012080	ontology from metaphysics. ontology is just talking about
5012080	5015760	what kind of things are. So when we say that the boundaries are
5015800	5020880	ontological, what we're saying is we're trying to capture kind
5020920	5025800	of features of the map, in some sense. And you know, what we've
5025800	5029680	argued in a paper recently is that the free energy principle is
5029680	5033120	metaphorically speaking, a map of that part of the territory
5033120	5038320	that behaves like a map. So I want to contrast this with
5038320	5042200	metaphysics in the sense that like this is all of this is a
5042200	5046880	modeling approach. This is a physics. This isn't saying like
5046920	5050440	once and for all, these boundaries are here and
5050440	5057040	crystallized and just, you know, are there independently of,
5057080	5061160	you know, the way that we are experiencing or sampling or
5061160	5065000	interacting with the world, like that that kind of metaphysical
5065000	5069440	stuff is not what's at stake. Yeah, so in the paper you're
5069440	5073600	referring to, we describe we describe these Markov blankets
5073760	5077320	as existential boundaries, in the sense that they're both
5077360	5081040	epistemological and ontological. They're ontological in the
5081040	5085320	sense that they are definitional of what a thing is, in this
5085320	5089200	kind of physics based approach, if you can pick out a thing as a
5089200	5095840	physical thing, then it has to have this blanket structure. And
5095840	5098600	it's it's epistemological in the sense that it's this
5098640	5102840	interface, right? Like the thing itself can only know the world
5102880	5106840	and indeed, we can only know the world, the thing through this
5107040	5111960	boundary. So like this isn't meant to be a priori. It's
5111960	5115080	sort of weird. It's in some sense, it's sort of like an app
5115080	5118600	posteriori. It's like an empirically driven way to
5118600	5119720	carve up the world.
5120760	5125560	That's fine. I mean, on that, I think that that answers my
5125560	5129760	question, because there's always this confusion about whether
5129760	5134080	we're talking about the map or the territory. And just to be
5134080	5136640	clear, we are we are always talking about the map when we
5136640	5137920	talk about these boundaries.
5138680	5141480	Yeah, the free energy principle is a map of the boundaries you
5141480	5145040	can think of and a map of what happens when things have
5145040	5149320	boundaries that it and so yeah, that that that is important to
5149320	5152320	keep in mind, like we don't want to engage in map territory
5152320	5156640	fallacies. The free energy principle is a model, it's a
5156640	5159680	scientific model, and it's a map and it turns out to be
5159720	5162920	the canonical way of modeling systems that are engaged in
5162920	5167280	modeling. So if maximum entropy is the canonical way of
5167280	5172400	modeling physical systems in physics, it's the way of arriving
5172400	5176520	at the most parsimonious model that generates, you know, some
5176520	5180920	data set, right? Well, the free energy principle is equally a
5180920	5185320	canonical way of modeling systems that also in turn seem to
5185320	5188120	be engaged in this kind of modeling behavior. But yeah,
5188480	5193160	it's a model, it's a map, you know, this probably is not the
5193160	5197600	final word. And, you know, we're, we're uncovering some, you
5197600	5201160	know, mathematical structure underneath the free energy
5201160	5205400	principle and the principle of unitarity and maximum caliber and
5205400	5208480	all of this stuff that we're tentatively calling G theory for
5208480	5214200	now in homage to M theory from string theory physics. So yeah,
5215080	5218520	you know, as most scientific models, like the progress of
5218520	5222480	science means that things will probably change. Like again, this
5222480	5227760	isn't a metaphysics. This is just a cohesive modeling approach
5227840	5230720	that inherits from the physics of information and self
5230720	5237240	organization. I would quickly just point out that the these
5237240	5240920	things like seem intrinsically related to observer
5240920	5245440	dependence, because they are in some deep sense. Carl's 2019
5245440	5249440	monograph, a particular free energy principle for a particular
5249440	5253960	physics ends on this idea that the free energy principle at core
5253960	5257840	is a metrological statement, where metrological means measure
5257840	5261120	theoretic or relating to measurement. And it basically
5261120	5264200	says, Well, things that exist, look as if they're constantly
5264360	5267320	measuring themselves and like keeping themselves within
5267320	5271320	certain bounds. So this is and you know, this is even clearer
5271320	5274360	from the quantum information theoretic formulation, where
5274360	5277000	like literally what we're saying is that the free energy
5277000	5281240	principle is a theory of observance, you know, the sort
5281240	5285280	of the it from bit, right? Like the it's thing this, but from
5285280	5288360	another perspective, it's observance, which which are kind
5288360	5292000	of the same thing. I'm sure Carl could say that again, more
5292000	5295960	eloquently than I. But at a high level, that's how I would
5296000	5296980	respond to your point.
5302200	5305920	Maybe Carl would like to give it a go. Yeah, Carl, you could do
5305920	5309600	that. And then also, since you're trying to decide if you're
5309600	5313080	an activist, you know, maybe, what other questions do we need
5313080	5316040	to ask for both of us actually to decide, you know, that we
5316040	5318120	haven't, that we haven't covered yet?
5318720	5322080	Yeah, we can we can ask Max, well, and Chris, to.
5324120	5329840	So just to pick up on that last exchange and come back to the
5329840	5334720	free energy principle as being gloriously gray. I think I like
5334720	5339840	that because, you know, the validity of that principle as
5339840	5342720	a method. So, you know, as a physicist, you would read any
5342720	5345360	principle as a method, something that you apply to some
5345400	5351040	thing. I think is is underwritten, not by its
5351040	5354960	explanatory scope, but by its internal consistency with other
5354960	5359480	principles that that people do apply. And I'm, that's what is
5359480	5363640	mentioned one. I think one important example of that, you
5363640	5367680	know, beyond the principles of least actual variational
5367680	5370080	principles that underwrite for, you know,
5370800	5375280	say Richard Feynman's work. I'm thinking of James's maximum
5375280	5378480	entropy principle. So Max well alluded to that in terms of
5378480	5383120	maximum caliber. So maximum entropy of distributions over
5383120	5386640	states just now becomes transformed into distributions
5386640	5392520	over paths when you move from when you move to the maximum
5392520	5395760	caliber principle. So the maximum entropy principle is
5396080	5400080	just a Max Janssen Max entropy principle for a pathological
5400080	5404080	formulation. And I think that's important to raise. The free
5404080	5407680	energy principle just is that it is just a constrained maximum
5407680	5410880	caliber principle or maximum entropy principle. And you may
5410880	5413280	ask, well, where did the constraints from come from? That's
5413280	5415840	just the generative model. It's just in the description of the
5415840	5418640	characteristic states that pull back a tractor that constitutes
5418640	5421680	the goals of the principle. And I think that's important to
5421680	5424640	realise the free energy principle just is that it is just a
5424720	5428560	that constitutes the goals we're just talking about. So, you
5428560	5432080	know, if you remember, free energy is just the expected energy,
5432080	5438160	the constraint part plus the entropy. And therefore, when
5438160	5441600	you're now drilling down on the constraint part, where does that
5441600	5444320	come from? It's just a description of the pullback
5444320	5446800	attractor of the characteristic states of the system that you're
5446800	5450720	trying to try to understand. So I really look at the free
5450720	5453600	energy principle as something terribly new. It's been
5453600	5456720	implicit there all the time. It's just people using slightly
5456720	5460560	different words for different concepts. So I think that's I
5460560	5463440	kind of why I'm saying this, but it seemed important to say.
5464640	5467280	And Max, what were you just talking about? Because there was
5467280	5468880	a link in terms of
5469520	5472960	were you maybe leading into the metrological aspects, the
5472960	5473760	self measurement?
5474400	5477040	Absolutely. I know that was really important. Yes, that's
5477040	5482720	right. So just looking backwards. What is the the sibling
5482720	5491280	of the, or the sibling of the free energy principle of in the
5491280	5494960	past century, in the past few decades, I think that would be
5494960	5497280	the maximum entropy principle, constraint maximum
5497280	5501280	entropy principle. Looking forwards, what would be the
5501280	5504480	bedfellows of the free energy principle? I think that the
5505040	5511120	that metrological or relational thing is vitally important.
5511840	5513840	And, you know, I love the work of
5516000	5518480	Carlo Revelli and his work with, you know,
5520000	5524480	quantum relational approaches to quantum mechanics, which is
5524480	5528240	all about relationships. And of course, how do you how do you
5529120	5532160	quantify a relationship? Well, it's just in terms of the
5532160	5534320	interaction, the coupling, which is going to be a sparse
5534320	5536480	coupling, it is just a measurement, it is just an
5536560	5540880	observation. So inference, measurement, synchronization,
5540880	5545520	sparse coupling, they're all the same thing. And so I think
5545520	5547920	that what will hopefully happen is that somebody will write
5547920	5552560	down a math possibly Dalton will write down a calculus that
5552560	5554960	says all of these things are just the same way of looking at
5554960	5558480	it. And I read yesterday, because I had to because I was
5558480	5562480	reviewing this paper for Synthese, about ontic structural
5562480	5567280	realism, ontic structural realism. And it seems to me that
5567280	5570080	that is basically philosophers having discovered the same
5571200	5575040	underlying fabric that the reality is in the measurement,
5575040	5578800	but it's the measurement of how we relate to each other via
5578800	5583680	that measurement of each other or things, measuring other
5583680	5588480	things, purely in terms of their relationships. So I think
5588720	5593840	that there is a lot of, if you like, work to be done from the
5593840	5599360	point of view of free energy principle theorists in consolidating
5599360	5602080	the links to what has gone in terms of things like maximum
5602080	5605040	entry principle, and what is to come in terms of, say,
5605040	5609200	quantum loop gravity or Chris Fields quantum information
5609200	5612240	theoretic treatment of holographic screens in the
5612240	5617760	Markov blanket. At each point, the FEP will become grayer
5617760	5621600	because it will be less easy to discriminate it from
5621600	5623840	everything else that stood the test of time.
5626240	5627600	Chris, do you have any comments on that?
5630080	5631840	You're on mute. You're on mute yet.
5634960	5638240	You're on mute, Chris. Sorry. So yeah, I think I'll leave it
5638240	5640320	there. It's a bit too deep into the philosophy for me, and
5640320	5643520	we've got two experts here, so I'll pass.
5643760	5647840	Wonderful. And to my point earlier, I mean, we won't go
5647840	5651920	into it now, but I guess my perspective is it all seems
5651920	5656480	like epistemology to me rather than ontology, and maybe we
5656480	5661040	can debate that a little bit later on. But as our uploads
5661040	5664000	are all quite slow, and I want to check that we secure this
5664000	5667680	beautiful interview, I'm going to cut it off at this point,
5667680	5670480	but gentlemen, it's been an absolute honor. Thank you so
5670480	5672800	much for coming on MLS here. Thank you so much to me.
5673680	5677200	Genuinely, always a pleasure, gentlemen. This is always great fun.
5679520	5683200	Beautiful. Beautiful. Yeah, I always enjoyed it.
