1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
Yeah, we're just like backups. We love net net Netflix

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,440
quality productions. Okay, well, in which case, let's kick

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,080
off. So we've we've had a couple of technical problems

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,600
with the stream. So now we're going to go pre recorded

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,800
instead, which is absolutely fine. So we're going to talk

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,360
about quite a few things today. Now, one big theme, I think

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,600
is talking about an activism and the kind of compatibility

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,360
between the free energy principle and an activism. We're

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,000
going to talk about. Now we have to be very careful how we

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,480
pronounce this words auto poetic. Is that right, Maxwell?

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,480
That's right. Yes. Amazing. So forgive me when I get it

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,320
wrong. I'm going to get it wrong. I'm sorry. So we're

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,920
talking about auto poetic and activism, which of which, of

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,280
course, was the brainchild of Varela. And there's an

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,320
interesting paper that came out, which was actually quite

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,320
critical of FEP. We're going to talk about some of the points

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,480
in that paper. And that was called laying down a forking

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,720
path tensions between an action and the free energy principle.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,640
And in that paper, there were a few areas. So there was the

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,160
definition of auto poesis, historicity. So we're talking

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,240
about temporal sequence invariance and non steady state

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,440
equilibria and what it means to be a Goddick. There was this

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,400
critique about the non stationarity of distributions.

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,280
And also really interesting discussion about internalism

25
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,600
versus externalism, because of course, the the inactive view

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,040
is is is a form of externalised cognition, which is this very

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,960
interesting view that you have cognizizing elements outside

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
of the mind in the environment around you. So we'll talk about

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,760
that as well. We'll touch on goal directedness and also

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,840
structure learning, which is a really, really exciting thing

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,800
in in any any Bayesian cognitive framework. Now on the call

32
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,520
today, we have obviously, first of all, Professor Karl

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,080
Friston, the inventor of the free energy principle and active

34
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,120
inference, a man who requires no introduction whatsoever.

35
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,920
Professor Friston, welcome to the show.

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,760
Great to be back.

37
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,680
Fabulous. We also have Dr. Maxwell Ramstead, one of the top

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,800
scholars in the free energy principle and the active

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,240
inference literature. Of course, we've had Maxwell on very

40
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,920
recently, but welcome back Maxwell.

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,840
Always a pleasure, gentlemen.

42
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,680
Amazing. And we also have a new face. Professor Buckley, would

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,840
you like to introduce yourself?

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,720
Yeah, yeah. So yeah, my I'm a faculty member at the University

45
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,200
of Sussex, but I also work with versus with Maxwell and Karl. So

46
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,680
I have a background originally in physics in postgraduate in

47
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,960
physics, and then moved into cognitive robotics. I was kind

48
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,880
of working in behavior based robotics, and an activism somewhat

49
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,240
early on my my PhD, moved into kind of theoretical neuroscience,

50
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,400
and kind of really got interested in the free energy

51
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,640
principle about eight or nine or so years ago and wrote a review

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,960
on it. Originally, you know, wanted to challenge it and

53
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,920
then eventually fell in love with it and now think it's the

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,560
right way to go for it for what we want to do. So I came as a

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,560
skeptic and then have been bashed into into into place. Do you

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,640
think now this is is the correct way to think about things?

57
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,880
Amazing. Well, let's let the bashing commence. Well, we'll

58
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,680
move straight on to the subject of an activism. So there is this

59
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,480
paper laying down a forking path tensions between an action and

60
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,000
the free energy principle. And the name is very hard to

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,600
pronounce it as Esquiel de Paolo. Paolo.

62
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,560
Okay, thank you so much. Now, just just to be fair to them,

63
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,480
because Maxwell, you did actually couch FEP as an activism 2.0,

64
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:47,160
despite the inactivist rejection of information methods. And maybe

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,240
we should start by defining an activism. And also, there's some

66
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,480
similarities with this other idea called ecological psychology.

67
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,680
So why don't why don't we just start by framing some of these

68
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,440
ideas up?

69
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,280
That sounds good. Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

70
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,520
Did you have like a pre prepared definition you wanted to

71
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,720
share? Do you want us to riff on this?

72
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,360
Well, why don't why don't we start with Varela's an activism?

73
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,640
So there are some so it's in terms of philosophy, there are hints

74
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,240
of existentialism and phenomenology and eastern influences

75
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,080
and focus on lived experience and stuff like that. One of the and

76
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,880
the core things is that they reject information processing and

77
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,360
computationalism. They focus on actions and interactions.

78
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,720
It's a very embodied tradition. So why don't we just kind of

79
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,520
start with that?

80
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,120
Okay, yeah, that's a great way to set it up. Well, I mean, we should

81
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,280
probably just add a little bit of context and a few caveats

82
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,640
before launching into this. So I think Chris and I are of the

83
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,320
generation that was trained in the inactive embodied tradition.

84
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,080
I would describe myself as a reformed inactivist. I don't

85
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,440
know if Chris, you resonate with that I still believe in

86
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,200
activism. Yeah.

87
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:15,160
So these, the inactive approach is one of the so called four e

88
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,600
approaches that have become very popular since the 90s. And I

89
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,080
would argue is, at least in in the more philosophically

90
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,480
informed corners of cognitive science and neuroscience, basically

91
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,680
the dominant theoretical paradigm right now. So it we have to

92
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,520
say there's a this is a broad church of approaches that go

93
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,760
from a more kind of minimalist recognition that cognition

94
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,360
involves bodily processes to the more radical approaches that

95
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,880
you were describing earlier that just wholesale reject

96
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,400
information theory, the computation, the computational

97
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,000
metaphor for mind that mind is basically a kind of computing

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,600
device. And yeah, the inactive approach grew out of

99
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,120
auto poetic theory. They're distinct. It's important to say.

100
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,160
So auto poetic theory was developed by Maturana and Barrela

101
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,840
sometime in the 1980s and 90s. And it was a very mechanistic

102
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,280
approach to mind. I mean, you know, some of the early kind of

103
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,800
flagship papers in this tradition are what the frogs I

104
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,600
tells the frogs brain and this kind of stuff. So you know, hard

105
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:43,960
nose kind of systems biology type thinking. And I mean, there

106
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:51,200
was basically a break in the literature where due to Barrela

107
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,000
in a lot of ways, the emphasis moving from kind of mechanistic

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,040
models to phenomenology to a kind of more dynamic, coupling

109
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,080
interactive kind of mode of explanation. So yeah, the inactive

110
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,840
approach is basically committed to this idea, fundamentally that

111
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,880
cognition is basically bringing about a world, a structured

112
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,080
world of meaning and significance through adaptive

113
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,080
appropriate actions left in the world. So the the slogan is, you

114
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,080
know, yeah, exactly constructing this meaning, you know, laying

115
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,280
down a path and walking, I think is the the slogan, the poetic

116
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:42,040
slogan form that's so popular. Yeah, and in its more radical

117
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,960
inclinations, this inactive approach says, dynamical

118
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,600
systems is really the way to study systems that have mind. And

119
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,080
so the kind of the background assumption there is that there's

120
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,640
a fork in the path in the road somewhere, you know, where we

121
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,200
have to choose between information theory and dynamics. And

122
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,200
yet they obviously go down the dynamics path. So I think that's

123
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,640
a setup. And before launching into criticism, I should say that

124
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,720
we as a community, genuinely appreciate and benefit from

125
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,720
friendly critical engagement. So I just want to caveat all this

126
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,000
by saying that the criticism comes from a place of wanting to

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,120
build community from a place from our hearts, basically. And

128
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,680
yeah, although I'm going to be saying a lot of critical stuff

129
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,760
about the inactive approach. In my heart, I'm an inactivist, I

130
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:45,080
think just that the a lot of the, a lot of the methodology and

131
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,280
explanatory constructs that are leveraged in the approach are

132
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,240
problematic. And in particular, you see this come out when

133
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,800
the free energy principle comes into play. So

134
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,600
So Chris, do you want to add anything to that that definition?

135
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,440
Yeah, I mean, I guess it's like, I see, I'm going to use this kind

136
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,800
of phraseology was in in one of Carl's books, which is a low

137
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,080
road and a high road and activism. I basically was brought up a

138
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,080
low road and activist rights. So this is kind of rejection of

139
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,600
representationalism in cognitive architectures. It was a

140
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,280
move away from good old fashioned artificial intelligence to

141
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,120
embedded and embodied agents. So this is kind of the origin in

142
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,560
Rodney Brooks's behavior based approaches to robotics. And

143
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,760
those are the kinds of ideas I still embrace. And then there's

144
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,560
the kind of high road and activism, which kind of embraces

145
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,520
auto pieces and operational closure at its heart. I mean,

146
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,880
to me, I mean, if you're if you're a high road and activists,

147
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,680
they are the same thing, they are they come from the same place.

148
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,520
But I think there's a kind of there is a there are messages

149
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,760
to take from an activism and the low road, which are super

150
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,480
important for cognition, right, without kind of going into the

151
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,880
depths of the auto poesis. Just in terms of like the language,

152
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,960
I think, I think there is a split between dynamical systems

153
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,600
theory, which is kind of the origins of descriptions of

154
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,280
automatic systems and information theory, but that that

155
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,480
community has begun to embrace, you know, a little bit of

156
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,000
information theory, but it tends to has been done through kind

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,840
of phenomenological models, simple models, rather than kind

158
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,560
of have this kind of theoretical angle or deep theoretical basis

159
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,040
in something like Bayes that like we do, right? I mean, I to

160
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,560
that paper, I read it before we come to me, it doesn't seem, you

161
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,440
know, some of the language is quite dismissive. But to me, it

162
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,080
seems an opportunity to see whether we can reconcile these

163
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,480
frameworks. And I think they've done a nice job in pointing

164
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,080
where there are maybe things we can express better within the

165
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
free energy principle that kind of address things like

166
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,600
operational closure. I feel that this community sometimes feels

167
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,360
like it has to be divided. But I'm very much an inclusive

168
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,760
person. So some really nice dialogue between people in an

169
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,640
activism and what we do in the active inference and the free

170
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,360
energy principle.

171
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,040
Interesting. I mean, I'll bring Professor Friston in in just a

172
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,480
second. But I was reading this very interesting paper by by

173
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,400
Maxwell, written in, I think it's 2019, multi scale integration

174
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,560
or internalism. And I was 21. Okay, so it's the multi scale

175
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,400
integration paper. And you know, of course, this this an active

176
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,840
philosophy is all about externalism. So you know, you

177
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,240
actually have these cognizing elements outside of of where

178
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,200
the brain is. And in a way, it's, there's this Helm-Hopsian

179
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,160
sharp separation between the organism and the environment,

180
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,320
which is perhaps embraced by neuroscientists. But the

181
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,880
interesting thing about the free energy principle is, is I

182
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,960
think it maintains some vagueness about this notion of

183
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,320
whether it's an internalist system, where you have strong

184
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,840
representations and predictive power about what's going on in

185
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,760
the world around you, versus being this kind of dynamical

186
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,920
externalist, inactive type system. And in that paper,

187
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,560
Maxwell, you are saying that well, actually, we can integrate

188
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,600
the two views because you can have these nested boundaries. And

189
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,120
as Professor Friston has said, human minds, the reason we have

190
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,000
this temporal depth of planning and sophistication and

191
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,080
representation building and so on, is because we're at the top

192
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,960
of the stack. But there's many, many layers below us where

193
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,520
perhaps it is more of an inactive externalized form of

194
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,800
cognition. So we can kind of speak to both worlds. But

195
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,760
Professor Friston, perhaps you could come in on that.

196
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,120
Yeah, I was frightened, you were going to ask me well, if I had

197
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,920
anything to add about inactivism, because I haven't, I'm here

198
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,040
to find out whether I'm an inactivist or not. So at the

199
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,920
end, it's only come tell me whether I'm an inactivist, I'd

200
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,600
be very grateful. There's probably some nuanced version of

201
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,080
it, like a moderate, epistemological inactivist

202
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:05,160
retrying. So I think, in that last point, Tim, I think is a

203
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,720
really interesting one. And in fact, I just reviewed a paper

204
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,720
synthese yesterday, I think, touching upon this issue from a

205
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,040
philosophical perspective. But very simply, the free energy

206
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,960
principle basically will accommodate both perspectives. It

207
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,120
rests upon an externalist view of the universe as a random

208
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,760
dynamical system, that just by equipping that system with a

209
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,880
partition that separates something from everything else,

210
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,520
then induces an internalist explanation for the way that

211
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,520
thing makes sense of its universe. So there is a necessary

212
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,480
enmeshing of both the externalist and the internalist

213
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,800
perspectives. You put it another way, the internalist

214
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,520
perspective is entirely licensed in terms of the

215
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,920
interpretation of self organization as a process of

216
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,160
inference. And you're with that an explicit commitment to a

217
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,320
certain kind of representationalism. But that only

218
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,240
inherits from the way you start from, which is an

219
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,680
externalist view of the thing in an external world with with a

220
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,640
particular metaphysics here described in terms of random

221
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,600
dynamical systems. And it's interesting, also, you pick up

222
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,480
on this fork in the road, which I confess, I completely, I do

223
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:34,000
not understand. You know, all interesting information theory

224
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:40,840
read as probability theory, that is used in physics inherits

225
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,640
from dynamical systems. You know, we're talking thing

226
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,200
ranging, things ranging from the master equation through

227
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,520
to Schrodinger's wave equation, the Fokker-Planck

228
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,680
equation, Comer of Ford equations, all of these are

229
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,640
information theoretic treatments of dynamical systems. So I don't

230
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,040
really understand the nature of this fork. So I probably should

231
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,480
now pass you back to me.

232
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,880
Well, can I follow up on that, Chris? And then maybe I don't

233
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,600
get it either. And so what what confuses me about it is, one of

234
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,280
the the brilliant things about the free energy principle, to me

235
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,720
is this exact connection between random dynamical systems of a

236
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,440
certain degree of complexity, let's say approaching

237
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,600
auto poetic, right? And in this behavior that they must

238
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,160
manifest in order to be what they are, right, which is which is

239
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,080
this balancing between between, you know, uncertainty and

240
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,440
prediction and that sort of thing. So to me, they're hand and

241
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,240
glove. And so I guess my question to you, Chris, since you were

242
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,000
going to jump in there is, what is the source of this conflict?

243
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,840
Like, is it a fear that if it's linked, if you link the

244
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,480
information and dynamics in this certain way that they have to

245
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,080
conform to this principle that we're all going to be put out of

246
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,280
work, or we're not going to be able to study the things we want

247
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,240
to study or just do you mind if I just quickly interject with a

248
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,480
little bit of context? Okay. Just to I wanted to elaborate a

249
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,040
little bit on what Carl said, because I think there were some

250
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,480
things in here that might move in what Carl said that might not

251
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,320
be clear to the audience of the bears repeating. The first is

252
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,600
that there's this idea that Markov blankets kind of seclude the

253
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,240
organism from the environment. This is sort of like the

254
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,360
Helmholtz style story where our relationship to the environment

255
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,840
is in some sense only indirect and we are separated from the

256
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,440
environment by our Markov blanket. The important thing to

257
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,920
point out is that just definitionally, the Markov

258
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,040
blanket comprises the set of degrees of freedom that separate

259
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,640
and couple systems together. So it's not the veil, it's the

260
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,280
interface. So that's the first thing to point out. So a radically

261
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,400
internalist interpretation of the free energy principle doesn't

262
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,680
work, because you actually need external states to be in play

263
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,400
for the math tour. If there are no external states, then there's

264
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,040
nothing to track. And there's nothing beyond the Markov

265
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,080
blanket. So you don't get the story started, like it doesn't get

266
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,960
off the ground. If you don't assume that there are these

267
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,960
things that the particle in question that the thing that

268
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,880
you're interested in is a tuning to and that so there needs to be

269
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,960
something to couple and to be separated from for the story to

270
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:24,520
get off the ground. So yeah, it's a if you write down your

271
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,080
dynamical systems equations, it's always the generative model

272
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,720
that we keep talking about is defined over your internal

273
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,560
blanket and external states. So that's the first point. What

274
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,440
Carlos is the other the other way around to which is if you're

275
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,720
empty of all internal states, and every single state you have

276
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,480
can be influenced from the outside. Well, there's less to

277
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,440
talk about. Well, then you're not a thing, strictly speaking,

278
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,960
right? That so you know, it's it's definitional to what it is to

279
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,200
be a thing to have this kind of interface between that thing

280
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,440
and other things. So that's a first point. So the internal

281
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,360
states as your point as you're pointing out do play an

282
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,200
asymmetric role. So the FEP says if you have this boundary,

283
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,320
then the internal states are going to parameterize the

284
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,520
belief about external states. So you do get this kind of

285
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,640
internalist looking thing going as well. So the there is a I

286
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,400
think a a kind of reconciliation of internalism and

287
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,800
externalism under the free energy principle. This is what the

288
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,600
2019 paper that you are referring to is about. It's

289
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,680
called multiscale integration. And that's precisely the idea

290
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,880
that things that look separated at one scale can be integrated

291
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,000
within, you know, the auspices of an overarching structure at

292
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,920
the scale above and so on and so on and so on. We're separate as

293
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,640
individuals, but we're coupled in this active inference

294
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,400
community. And, you know, arguably, there's an intentionality

295
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,880
also at play there. Same thing for ourselves, right? Our

296
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,240
cells are separate because they have their individual

297
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,520
boundaries, but then they're integrated on the time scale

298
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,320
of me as an organism and so on. So that's that was about

299
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,120
internalism and externalism. I wanted to speak quickly to the

300
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,040
split between dynamics and information theory. Whenever I

301
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,640
talked to my friends in high end mathematics about this, they

302
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,360
are always as perplexed as you know, Keith and Carl, you are

303
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,920
because it's a nonsensical starting point. To do dynamical

304
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,000
systems theory seriously, you at some point are going to need

305
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,320
to appeal to information theoretic measures. So for

306
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,480
example, distances in state space. So, you know, the

307
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,880
inactivists are all thought, you know, they like to appeal to

308
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,440
dynamical systems theory and stuff, but the systems that

309
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,240
they're considering are usually extremely simple, with a few

310
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,720
degrees of freedom that are coupled together. But if you

311
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,640
want to do like, you know, grown up, dynamical systems theory,

312
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,000
then you're going to need to appeal to things like information

313
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,400
length to describe the really the metrics on your state space,

314
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,880
you can't avoid that. Similarly, when we're talking about

315
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,480
information, we're talking about dynamical, you know, the

316
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,840
dynamic time course of the these coupling. So we're interested

317
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,440
in the dynamics of information, these things are not actually

318
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,080
separable. The idea that they are comes from philosophy,

319
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,360
actually, it's a set of papers from the basically late 80s,

320
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,280
early 90s by Van Gelder, and Port. And at the time, you know,

321
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,160
dynamical systems theory was a new thing in cognitive science.

322
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,680
And what they were saying was, Hey, there's this approach that

323
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,800
we can take, it's dynamical systems, it's not computational.

324
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,320
And basically, it moved from there to there's an there's this

325
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,520
alternative approach that's mutually incompatible. And that

326
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,160
shift kind of happened slowly by a self referential literature.

327
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,040
So, you know, this is where I'm going to be a bit critical. You

328
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,440
can really do the historiography and trace these claims back to

329
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,080
I mean, basically Van Gelder and Port, and to some extent

330
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,760
Gibson. But these folks, they don't offer a formal argument,

331
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,080
right? Like, they're not saying here's a proof that dynamical

332
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,480
systems and compute computational approaches are like

333
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,320
incompatible. They're just starting with this gut feeling

334
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,680
that hey, maybe there's something different here. And then

335
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,960
that turns into I would argue, splurrata sizes or like hardens

336
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,640
into like an a priori dogmatism, crystallizes that isn't

337
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,160
necessary. Yeah, exactly. That is just based, like I was saying

338
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,880
on this kind of circular, you know, we're just citing other

339
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,520
philosophers who cite other philosophers who are making this

340
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,160
stuff up at the bottom. So, yeah, I mean, I kind of feel like

341
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,880
this is a problem with the philosophy literature is like,

342
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,360
you know, taking just conceptual arguments from other

343
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,680
philosophers, maybe a bit more seriously than they should,

344
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,120
without really taking the time to do the proper historiography,

345
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,800
looking where these claims are originating, and then asking

346
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,440
the question, is there any real warrant for this kind of

347
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,040
separation? So yeah, I've been going around recently saying

348
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,200
that yeah, this split between dynamics and information theory

349
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,720
is mostly in people's imaginations. There's no

350
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,080
mathematical basis for it.

351
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,320
And Chris, you wanted to jump in. No, no, thank you wanted to

352
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,000
jump in earlier and maybe talk about your personal journey

353
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,080
that might come into play here.

354
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,960
Yeah, I mean, Maxwell's, you know, said some really

355
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,760
interesting stuff there. I mean, I guess I take a slightly

356
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,800
less hard line on that, right? I mean, I think it's a historical

357
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,240
thing. So Tim Van Gelder, we're looking at deterministic

358
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,680
dynamical systems theory, like this is in the absence of

359
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,080
noise. And unless you do ensembles of systems, it's not

360
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,720
there's no clear pathway then to information theory. And then

361
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,920
initially in models, when in the 80s and 90s, typically, yeah,

362
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,440
deterministic dynamical systems theory, looking at

363
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,760
bifurcations and so on. And then, but obviously, the richer

364
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,680
the richer set of descriptions is stochastic

365
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,160
dynamical systems theory. And that's when information theory

366
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,720
becomes irreplaceable, right? This become and then they've

367
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,000
come fully in meshed these these descriptions as Carl writes

368
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,760
about so nicely and lots of his work, right? But I think, you

369
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,600
know, I didn't see the forking path as kind of this. I know

370
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,920
in the community that there's a history of using dynamical

371
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,280
systems theory, and there's a sense in which the free energy

372
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,880
is really embraced information theory. I didn't see that

373
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,800
that's as a as a key, the for the key in the fork of the path,

374
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,080
right? I mean, I got to say that it's a way out of my area,

375
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,280
this this kind of depth of philosophy, but it seemed to me

376
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,480
the kind of the problem of operate the definition of

377
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,760
operational closure that seemed to be upsetting to Randall

378
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,120
Behr and is equal to power. And the fact that they don't think

379
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,360
that can be embraced by the tenants of the free energy

380
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,160
principle. I mean, I don't I think they they made a nice case,

381
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:33,520
I don't think it a priori that's the case. I can't see there

382
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,480
was a hands down argument that there is this forking path. I

383
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,080
still think it's an interesting angle to take to think deeply

384
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,080
about operational closure within the free energy principle is I

385
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,120
know Maxwell has and he's going to tell you the answers to this,

386
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,040
but you know, so I'm just aware of the trickiness in defining

387
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,840
operational closure that's happened in the literature in the

388
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,440
last 20 years. And then really, in an inability to kind of

389
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,720
really get a concrete quantitative description of what we

390
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,520
mean by operational closure. And so, you know, I guess it's to

391
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,120
say that we've simply solved it within the free energy principle

392
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,320
that might that might have put some backs up somewhere. But you

393
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,160
know, Maxwell, maybe can give you a bit more insight to this

394
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,520
because he's thought deeply about how to define a place

395
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,960
closure within the frame. Can I can I can I frame up for you,

396
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:27,040
Maxwell? So the paper quoted you actually, I think you you said

397
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,440
on one of your papers that there is an analogy, almost a direct

398
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,280
mapping between this concept of organizational closure and a

399
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,840
Markov blanket. And of course, the Markov blanket is this

400
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,280
conditional independence that you're talking about. And you

401
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,480
also called it an interface earlier on. And when they speak

402
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,160
about the definition of auto polices, they say that, I think

403
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,920
the way that you folks in the FEP literature culture is mostly

404
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,640
as a form of autonomy, which is this ability to maintain your

405
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,400
own identity under precarious position, you know, situations.

406
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,280
And they say, well, the Varela kind of definition of auto

407
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,240
polices is very much about structure and organization. So

408
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,520
it's not it's not just maintaining your own identity,

409
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,160
but it's about this self organization and this kind of

410
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,400
generating structure as well. So I wonder just just with those

411
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,280
things on the table, could you, could you

412
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,840
absolutely. So in that paper, I confess that I probably should

413
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,000
have spoken, we probably should have spoken a bit more

414
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,120
precisely. We say the Markov blanket formalism. What we mean

415
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,080
by that is, and I don't think that this was fully appreciated by

416
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,240
the authors at the time. What we mean is Markov blankets and the

417
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,560
generative models, right? Because the claim is, right, let's

418
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,400
remind the audience, just put the terms on the table. A

419
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,840
generative model, right, is our model of the dependencies that

420
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,720
link the states and parameters that make up a given system,

421
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,240
right? So it is our way of talking about basically the

422
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,920
causal, connective tissue or structure that underwrites a

423
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:11,040
given system. And what the free energy principle says is, if

424
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,600
the underlying system has is disconnected in a certain

425
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,400
appropriate way, then you get this tracking behavior. And

426
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,800
formally speaking, it says, if there's a Markov blanket in

427
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,160
this dependency structure, right, if conditioned on certain

428
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,120
blanket states, then it looks as if subsets of the system are

429
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,160
independent from each other, but also tracking each other,

430
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,960
then you know, you get you get this interesting behavior, like

431
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,240
the if there is this Markov blanket is if there is this

432
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,600
independent structure, then you will get this tracking

433
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,480
behavior. That's what the free energy principle is talking

434
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,360
about. So of course, it's not sufficient to say that things

435
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,240
are carved out in a specific way. And therefore, you know, you

436
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,120
can say interesting things about them. But I think what's

437
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,160
missed in the argument, and this has to do with like, you know,

438
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,520
I think the app, the, the, the, I'll say, provocatively, the

439
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,440
dogmatic commitment to anti-representationalism is like

440
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,480
what when the inactivists read generative model, they mean a

441
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,560
model in my head that I carry around, they hear like a

442
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,240
representation, right? But what's really at stake is the

443
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,160
generative model is the dependency structure. Right? So if

444
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,160
you have the right kind of dependency structure that

445
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,560
generates a Markov blanket, I would say that you have what the

446
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,360
inactivists call operational closure. In fact, you can show

447
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,120
this mathematically, it's I don't think it's appreciated, but

448
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,320
there is a duality that has been rigorously established. Dalton

449
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,360
Shakti Maribel is probably the main proponent of this work,

450
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,760
but you know, Carl has done a lot of work over the last two

451
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,720
decades in this direction. Yeah, I think the the kind of core

452
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:59,200
idea to remember is that minimizing your variational

453
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,080
entropy with your variational free energy with respect to a

454
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,480
generative model, right? So the usual free energy story, right,

455
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,080
is dual to or equivalent to maximizing your entropy with

456
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,960
respect to a set of constraints. So when the inactivists talk

457
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,440
about constraint closure and all this stuff, you know, Alicia

458
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,240
Gerero's new book, context changes, everything, the

459
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,320
inactivists in the auto poetic tradition really want to go

460
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,720
hard on this and say, Well, what you really need to do is map a

461
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,640
set of constraints, such that the system kind of self

462
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,480
generates. Well, that is rigorously, and absolutely

463
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,120
equivalent to minimizing your free energy with respect to a

464
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,200
generative model, there's no difference there. So we're talking

465
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,720
about the same thing, we're talking about the way that like a

466
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,840
set of structured dependencies generates a thing that's able to

467
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,960
sustain itself over time. And as I was saying, this sustained

468
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,200
over time is a way of describing the interface or

469
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,160
coupling between the system and its environment. So that just

470
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,880
mathematically, we're talking about the same thing.

471
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,200
But let me ask you a question here, because there's, and this

472
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,160
is hopefully because I like Carl, I want to find out if I'm an

473
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,280
inactivist. So maybe, maybe you can help set us up for

474
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,960
considering this, a big bone of contention for them in that

475
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,360
paper, is this distinction that they have in their mind between

476
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,000
structure and organization. And they seem to get upset when any

477
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,920
attempt is made to link organization to structure. For

478
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,400
example, you know, to me, the Markov boundary that say

479
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,480
analogous to a, a animal cell membrane, I understand as a

480
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,320
former person who studied biology, that the molecules of

481
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,560
that membrane are in flux, things come and go, proteins

482
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,720
are added, carbohydrates are removed, etc. I don't have in

483
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,280
my mind a set of molecules that's like they're forever, and

484
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,960
some type of like, you know, stationary structure, like it's

485
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,400
a very dynamic kind of system. But they seem to say, Oh, no,

486
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,800
if you if you equate, you know, a Markov boundary to an

487
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,400
organizational structure, then you're making this, you know,

488
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,080
fallacy of kind where you're associating like an organization

489
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,080
with like the substrate that, you know, manifests that in

490
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,720
reality. Like, can you explain to me like what they were

491
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,320
actually up and about with this organization structure? You

492
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,640
know, maybe Carl, if you could comment on it, when Maxwell

493
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,280
tells us so we can figure out if we're an activist. So I'll just

494
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,160
let me bracket the stuff about stationarity and historicity

495
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,400
for one second. Because I have some stuff to say about that. But

496
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,200
so it comes back to that we'll come back to that question about

497
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,120
that. It comes back to what I was saying about, you know, it's

498
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,160
not just about Markov blankets, it's about generative models. If

499
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,320
you don't appreciate the distinction. And what you think

500
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,720
we're saying is Markov blankets tell the whole story, then

501
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,160
obviously, you're going to, you know, think that we're

502
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,400
conflating structure and organization. When you realize

503
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,520
that what we're talking about is, you know, a Markov blanket

504
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,080
within this dependency structure, right, that then I think you

505
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,400
you move to something else, I would say like what the

506
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,200
inactivist called structure corresponds to these Markov

507
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,600
blankets that we're drawing. And the organization we talk

508
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,440
about, and we harness in the generative model, right, that

509
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,720
remember, the generative model is not my internal

510
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,440
representation in my head, it's the overall dependency

511
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,880
structure of the system. It's what they would call the

512
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,400
organization of the system. So I mean, I would agree that we

513
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,840
shouldn't conflate them. And I would, you know, add that we

514
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,840
don't, there are distinct constructs that map onto these

515
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,400
things. And, you know, I would also point out that Markov

516
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:41,560
blankets are flexible. We will be putting out work over the

517
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,280
next few months on wandering Markov blankets, like we've got

518
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,120
figured out algorithmically now, we can draw a blanket around a

519
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,760
flame and stuff like that. Now, so we've got all of that

520
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,480
working. And it's not

521
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,920
I've been looking forward to that since Carl mentioned it in

522
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,560
the first, the first interview with him, let's, let's set an

523
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,160
anchor to come back to that because that that's very

524
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,720
interesting. Actually, one comment you made in your

525
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,280
multi scale paper was that these are ontological boundaries by

526
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,520
which I think you are implying that they are not a lens, they

527
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,760
are fixed to some extent. But I want to just stick on this

528
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,720
organization point for a second, though. So in the paper,

529
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,440
they said that essentially the way the FEP couches this is as a

530
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,520
form of homeostasis, which is just about, you know, maintaining

531
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,360
structural properties. And when they spoke about organization,

532
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,840
they said the conservation of organization is what's spoken

533
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,040
about in the classic orthopedic literature. And I think you are

534
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,640
just making the argument Maxwell that that that generative

535
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,840
model is in some sense the conservation of organization. So

536
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,600
is that the missing link? I mean, maybe a professor for us and

537
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,280
you can come in.

538
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,400
Yeah, do you want to take that Carl? I mean, I think that's

539
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,920
right. But Carl will probably comment more eloquently than I

540
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,440
on that.

541
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,120
I don't think so. I think you're being very eloquent.

542
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,080
Thank you.

543
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Do your worst and then I'll chip in if necessary.

544
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,440
Yeah, I mean, I think that's that's exactly right. Like the

545
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,840
Markov blankets don't have to be permanent. They can be

546
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,720
shifting and basically minimizing your free energy with

547
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,880
respect to some generative model corresponds to keeping some

548
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,240
structure in play.

549
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,080
Yep. Actually, this segue is nicely into the stuff about

550
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,640
stationarity and historicity. I think this is the biggest

551
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,240
problem in their paper. They claim that the free energy

552
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,960
principle can't account for historicity, in the sense that

553
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,160
it can't account for path dependency, right? So for our

554
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,520
audience, path dependency is this idea that it's not just your

555
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,000
position in state space that matters. It's also your velocity,

556
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,480
roughly speaking, right? That like the kind of direction that

557
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,640
you're going in, where you came from is just as important to

558
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,680
where you're going is where you are currently. And they claim

559
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,240
that, you know, the free energy, so they make a bunch of false

560
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,560
claims about the free energy principle, which leads them

561
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,640
astray. So for example, they claim that the free energy

562
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,400
principle assumes stationarity. It doesn't. As we've discussed

563
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,600
before, there are different applications of the free energy

564
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,080
principle in the literature. The two main families of

565
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:26,360
applications are density dynamics and path intervals. So I

566
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,840
drink a lot of coffee. And if you were to sample me at random

567
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,240
during the day, I would say there's a one in 25 chance. Yeah,

568
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,560
exactly. I would say there's a one in 25 chance that I'm

569
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,120
drinking coffee if you just sample me randomly during the

570
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:44,040
day. If you were to sample me over a week, once per day,

571
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,280
there's a 100% chance that I would drink coffee per day, right?

572
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,760
So there's a difference between looking at the probability of

573
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,320
states of me, you know, Maxwell is drinking coffee, and the

574
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,480
probabilities of paths of me or entire trajectories of me. And

575
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,520
that is a really critical distinction. The free energy

576
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,080
principle started off as a path based formulation. And I think

577
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,800
this is absolutely underappreciated in the literature.

578
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,000
If you look back at Carl's early papers, including the ones

579
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,560
that everyone has read, right? The 2010 unified brain theory

580
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,760
paper in nature. Yet these are all written in terms of paths.

581
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,240
Carl is taking like a sensory path and then writing down, you

582
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:29,600
know, blanket paths and internal paths. And it's all, it's all

583
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,480
about the way the trajectories of the system are maintained. So

584
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,360
this is a cool idea that was there before and that we're

585
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,720
doubling back down on now, which is that it's really, it's

586
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,800
about blanket paths that make internal paths independent of

587
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,760
external paths. So there's a sense in which like, it's always

588
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,920
been about counterfactual futures. It's, and it's difficult to

589
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,840
argue that, like, you don't account for historicity when

590
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,760
literally the core construct that you're deploying is, like

591
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,000
probabilities of different histories, like counterfactual

592
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,600
futures. But that entire argument about historicity makes no

593
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,920
sense formally, just abs, you know, and again, we appreciate

594
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,240
the critical engagement. This isn't to, you know, bash anyone

595
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,480
specifically. But like, this is a complete non starter

596
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,720
mathematically. Also, when you're doing density dynamics,

597
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,320
right, when you're not considering probability densities

598
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,680
over paths, but rather you're considering probabilities of

599
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,640
states, and you're doing this non equilibrium steady state

600
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,120
stuff. So when you are assuming stationarity, you're saying

601
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,080
like, yeah, there are these kind of regular cyclical

602
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,880
behaviors that I want to model, even in that context, the

603
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,120
free energy principle can handle path dependence, like

604
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,360
literally, I think on page 12 of like Carl's monograph from

605
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:49,360
2019, on the density dynamics formulations, there are already

606
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,280
terms that contain, you know, expressions that are able to

607
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,400
handle path dependency, that are basically dependent on

608
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,240
changes in surprise in your system. So, so

609
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,760
before we, before we move too far, maybe Chris, you can, you

610
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,120
might be able to steel man what the, the paper was trying to

611
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,640
say there, or

612
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,320
well, I'm just, I'm just, I'm trying to understand, I'm trying

613
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,240
to decide if I'm an inactivist, because Tim's a big fan. So I

614
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,480
want to, you know, give it fair judge anyone, does anybody

615
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,960
want to steel man, you know, where the paper might have been

616
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,120
coming from, in terms of this argument against

617
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,400
historicity?

618
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,760
I can straw man it if you want it.

619
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:36,520
No, I'm happy to have a go at it. But I mean, so we're a very

620
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,440
broad church at within this community, we we debate within

621
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,760
ourselves about the, you know, the true origins and how we get

622
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,000
these things out. So I actually was worried about this

623
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,040
historicity thing. In an earlier version, we did in, we

624
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,640
published in physics life reviews with a student, a very

625
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,640
talented student of mine. And we found real problems with it

626
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,800
when we were in a state based formulation of the system. And

627
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,880
I know Maxwell feels that that even in the state based

628
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,280
description of probability densities that we can recover

629
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:13,880
historicity, I guess we still not complete agreement on that.

630
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,320
But what's majorly happened in the in the free energy is this

631
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,280
movement to pass. And I agree with Maxwell, if you go back into

632
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,120
Carl's original work, talking like Carl was not here, but you're

633
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,800
back to Carl's original work, he was framing in terms of paths.

634
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,080
But the presentations in the monograph were to do to do with

635
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,640
states. And when we work through that, we found that the

636
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,720
historicity was hard to to to get back into these systems. But

637
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,040
the path formalization then makes it clear how historicity

638
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,560
because it's built into the system because you're preserving

639
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,360
sets of paths you go to, you know, homeoresis rather than

640
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,720
homeostasis in the descriptions of these systems. And then

641
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,400
there's this kind of nice, elegant way to deal with

642
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,760
historicity. And, you know, and I think so, I don't think

643
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,280
that's a real issue with the free energy principle. So, but I

644
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,080
can imagine, I don't know what technical literature they've

645
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,360
read. But perhaps if they've read the state based formula,

646
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,000
formulation, they had the same worries about those about

647
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,520
historicity. And if they read these new path based stuff that

648
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,640
Maxwell and Dalton are developing, I think those kind

649
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,480
of dissolve. I think that it's a much richer framework now.

650
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,760
So maybe Carl, what were you thinking back then when you did

651
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,240
it as as paths, you know, maybe just give us some some thought

652
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,760
behind your intuition for why you originally formulated it as

653
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,040
you know, path, path integrals for past systems and you know,

654
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:39,120
what your perspective is on what we've been discussing so far.

655
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:45,200
Right. I can't really remember. I suppose the obvious answer is

656
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,200
much of this inherits from Richard Feynman's work on the

657
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,280
path integral formulation. Indeed, the variational free

658
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,320
energy can be traced right back to I think probably is PhD

659
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,680
thesis. I haven't actually read the PhD thesis, but I've been

660
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,480
told that all the maths you need is there. So it would be

661
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,120
difficult for me to conceive of a calculus that wasn't framed in

662
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:12,480
terms of in terms of paths, until you start to try and draw

663
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,960
graphics and explain to people who are not familiar with, you

664
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,960
know, with the notion of, you know, with the path integral

665
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,040
formulation and its equivalence with density dynamics as

666
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,240
articulated say with the Vokker-Planck equation or I repeat

667
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:33,080
sort of Kolmogorov forward and backward equations. So I think

668
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:39,200
that is, you know, that's one really important aspect of

669
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,320
historicity and becomes I think even more prescient when you

670
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,720
think about deploying a path integral formulation of self

671
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,600
organisation in the context of 21st century physics, because

672
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,240
what we're talking about now is a move away from 20th century

673
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,920
equilibrium physics with pointer tractors to open systems that

674
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,960
are far from equilibrium. So mathematically, or one

675
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
mathematical bright line between the physics of equilibria and

676
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,200
the physics of non equilibria, which is what the free energy

677
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:20,040
principle is about, or specifically, when non equilibrium

678
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,800
city-state solutions admit a Markov blanket, but returning to

679
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,880
the sort of what is definitive of non equilibria, it is

680
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:37,080
effectively the, not the historicity, but the itinerancy

681
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:41,640
you get from solenoidal dynamics, sort of conservative

682
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:46,920
dynamics that now supplement the dissipative flows that

683
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,520
characterize completely classical physics and equilibrium

684
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,080
equilibria steady states. So if you wanted to define the

685
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,600
difference between an open system or an out of equilibrium or

686
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,360
non equilibrium system from an equilibrium system, the simple

687
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,920
kind of systems that Chris was referring to in his toy models

688
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,560
of your does a free energy principle work in your in this

689
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:17,200
kind of system, then all you would do is write down the

690
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,160
dynamics in terms of dissipative and conservative or

691
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:28,080
non-dissipative divergence free components. And that, if you

692
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:32,440
like, decomposition of the flow into conservative and

693
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,520
dissipative parts is just the Helmholtz decomposition is just

694
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,880
the fundamental number of variational calculus, I think,

695
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,760
or fundamental theorem, which just says that, you know, any

696
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:50,400
flow, any dynamics can always be decomposed into this sort of

697
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,200
gradient descent that underwrites classical physics or

698
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,640
equilibrium physics, and the a solenoidal divergence free flow

699
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,280
that underwrites classical mechanics. But you put the two

700
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:10,960
together and you have, by definition, now a mathematical

701
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,400
image of non equilibrium systems. And notice that in

702
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:21,160
introducing this kind of itinerancy, that is, for

703
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:25,280
example, you know, heuristically, you know, water going

704
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,040
down a plug hole. So the dissipative part, the gradient

705
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,040
flow would be the the water tumbling down into the depths

706
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,800
of your house. But as it circulates around, technically,

707
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,720
in terms of the information theory around on ISO contours,

708
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,920
the probability distribution, but you know, you can just

709
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,840
visualize the water circular, that's the solenoidal part. And

710
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,880
of course, when you talk about biotic self organization or

711
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,240
self organization, non equilibria, that has that sort of

712
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:02,360
life like our biotic form, the key characteristic of this

713
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,760
kind of biotic circulation is basically rhythms and life

714
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:12,400
cycles. So the very fact you're dealing with this kind of

715
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:18,600
historicity that is inherent in the itinerancy of any system

716
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,880
that is not at equilibrium means that you are you have to

717
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,400
write down or have an understanding or a mathematics

718
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,640
that deals with these with these flows and these life cycles.

719
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:35,240
Just one interesting twist here is if you take the randomness

720
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,880
out of it, if you go back to deterministic dynamical

721
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,320
systems of the kind, I now understand under the split or

722
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,120
the fork in the road in philosophy. What you do is

723
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,040
you're basically removing from the perspective of the

724
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,200
Helmholtz decomposition, the dissipative part, and you just

725
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,440
left with the conservative part. What is that? That's just

726
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,720
Newtonian mechanics. It's his classical mechanics, which is

727
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,280
why the sun, we rotate around the sun or the moon takes these

728
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,040
orbits. This is just this solenoidal flow in the limit that

729
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,640
you've ignored the randomness that you need that calls for the

730
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,280
information theoretic or probabilistic descriptions of any

731
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,560
world. So that the free energy principle doesn't deal with all

732
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,200
kinds of systems. It deals with systems that have an admixture

733
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,880
of both the dissipative and the solenoidal or divergence free

734
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,920
parts. If you wanted to just do the dissipative parts, you do

735
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,120
quantum mechanics. If you just wanted to do the solenoidal

736
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,840
part, you do classical mechanics and deterministic

737
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:40,640
systems. But in the middle, you're in the Goldilocks regime

738
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,840
in which you and I operate, we're talking about stochastic

739
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,680
chaos, basically, another description of this itinerancy.

740
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,080
So I think that that's that's, you know, one aspect of

741
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:56,640
historicity, which, you know, is celebrated in the physics of

742
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,880
self organization. And I keep using the word self organization

743
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,240
because I read auto poesis as self creation, or at least self

744
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,280
maintenance. I now appreciate it is not quite self. It's slightly

745
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:15,680
beyond self maintenance and in the sense that, you know, to

746
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:22,040
create your imply something slightly greater that maybe I'm

747
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,920
going to have to ask Chris, it may be related to operational

748
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:29,160
closure. So I'd like to if somebody just describe for me and

749
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,960
the audience when operational closure is that would be quite

750
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,400
nice. But before you do, there is another important aspect of

751
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,640
historicity, which we haven't mentioned, which inherits from

752
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,120
the deployment of the free energy principle, or perhaps

753
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,560
just the Helmholtz decomposition in using the apparatus of the

754
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,680
renormalization group. And what that brings to the table is a

755
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,080
separation of temporal scales. And as soon as you have that in

756
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,840
play, there's a different kind of historicity, which you have to

757
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,000
accommodate in any given calculus, certainly for open

758
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,120
systems, which means that the kind of steady state solutions

759
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,920
that are non equilibrium set solutions, we are talking about

760
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:16,040
in the context of a pathological formulation only exist over a

761
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,680
certain timescale. There's always a timescale above that

762
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:22,840
contextualizes it. And there's always a timescale below that is

763
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,760
much, much faster, where things live for very, very short

764
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,720
periods of time. I think that's another important aspect of

765
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,680
historicity that we're not talking about a unique or

766
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,560
privileged timescale here. So when people talk about

767
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:43,280
stationarity, or ergodicity, or steady states, they, you know,

768
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,200
one cannot say that this is the configuration of a system at

769
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,360
equals infinity. Because you have to acknowledge that there is no

770
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,960
privileged timescales at this timescale, we will assume that

771
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,920
is a state solution. But we have to be very explicit is at this

772
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,440
timescale. And this does not apply at the timescale above, or

773
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,880
at all the timescale below. And interestingly, just

774
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,800
mathematically, perhaps a naive mathematical or certainly a

775
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,960
physicist's mathematical perspective, and the very fact

776
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,400
you have the separation of timescale basically means that

777
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,360
there are fast, there's fast stuff for fast dynamics and slow

778
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:28,200
dynamics. And at the end of the day, if you now consider what is

779
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,000
the difference between the flow of states that you would find in

780
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:37,160
deterministic, deterministic dynamical system, and the random

781
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,240
fluctuations that convert it into a random dynamical system, the

782
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,040
only difference between these things is whether they're fast or

783
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,880
slow. So you can treat the random fluctuations, the noise that

784
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,080
induces a probabilistic description, and all the

785
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:56,680
information theoretic treatments, as simply the fast things, and

786
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:01,480
everything else is the slow stuff. So again, speaking to, if

787
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:07,880
you like, an almost necessary connection between any dynamical

788
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:12,160
systems formulation that is sufficiently liberal to include

789
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,960
fast and slow stuff, and probabilistic treatments of that

790
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,520
of the kind that Richard Feynman pursued in terms of trying to

791
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,920
work out the probability of the path of the small particle or

792
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,200
electron for his PhD thesis. Anyway, what is operational

793
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:27,840
closure?

794
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:33,520
So just go up a definition from Varela, if you want me to read

795
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:33,880
it out.

796
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:37,440
Can I just frame you up there, Chris? Because in that forking

797
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,520
paper, there was I actually thought it was a little bit

798
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,560
hand wavy. It's not like in graph theory, where you have very

799
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,840
kind of precise definition. So they had a they had a kind of a

800
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,520
node diagram. And they said it was operationally closed if all

801
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:55,440
of the black colored nodes had one arrow going out and

802
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,080
connecting to another one. And they had a kind of diagram

803
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:02,040
just showing an organism. But what's the official definition,

804
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:02,320
Chris?

805
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,160
Yeah, so this is a definition from Varela, as an autonomous

806
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,480
system is that is that organization is characterized by

807
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,960
processes such that the processes are related as a network, so

808
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,480
that recursively depend on each other in the generation

809
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,960
realization of the processes themselves. And two, they

810
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,120
constitute the system as a unity, recognizable in space, in

811
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,400
which those processes exist. So it's kind of this deep

812
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,720
recursive recursivity between the processes, maintaining the

813
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,280
network is necessary for the processes, this kind of

814
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:35,960
generation of the system's own constraints. I guess this has

815
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,080
been it's always been the kind of slightly ineffable within the

816
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,720
auto put it literature, what this means formally, right?

817
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,680
There's a deep intuition. This is correct. You know, you think

818
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,720
about, as Keith said before, we the matter is changing as as

819
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,600
fluxes changing these processes, but the identity is

820
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,480
somehow staying the same. And that's the organizational

821
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,880
structure that's maintained over time, rather than the

822
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,280
material components of that, that structure. And I do think

823
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,400
you know, that there is a sense that was when we did focus on

824
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,520
these state based descriptions of the free energy principle, I

825
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:13,280
think that kind of undersold the solenoidal flow that Carl was

826
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,040
talking about, whereas that is, I think it's much more

827
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,400
important to the people in in auto poise is because this notion

828
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:22,680
of this kind of flow of information and the organization

829
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,160
is dynamic within the equilibrium is important for for that

830
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,720
field. So I think the you know, the new directions they've got

831
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,960
in the free energy principle things that Maxwell and Dalton

832
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,040
are pursuing is to me an exciting opportunity to kind of

833
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,920
reconcile some of the ineffability of these operational

834
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,240
closure ideas in auto poise and this framework, essentially.

835
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,520
Cool, cool. So

836
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,480
Maxwell, do you want to do you want to comment maybe briefly on

837
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,360
that before we move on? Like Chris, Chris called out some of

838
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,800
your work there with Dalton?

839
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,360
Yeah, I mean, in a good way, though, I think what Chris is

840
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,120
saying is that he agrees with the direction. I would just say

841
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,560
that this isn't really new work. And this says that you would

842
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,480
Dalton and I are just doing is extending work that Carl did

843
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,600
20 almost 20 years ago. So I see this as more continuous. You

844
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,880
know, someone might say that I'm being overly generous, which I

845
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,720
might be, you know, by looking at this as like one kind of

846
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:23,320
continuous development. But yeah, I don't really, I think, you

847
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,240
know, you can think of the state based description as sort of

848
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,640
the asymptotic limit of the path based description, the two are

849
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:37,440
kind of like deeply connected in some sense. So no, I mean, I

850
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,040
think this is real, this is the direction that we want to go.

851
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,560
There's still some interesting stuff that you can say using the

852
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:47,160
density dynamics formulation. We just have to be you know, it's

853
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:52,280
like we were discussing Keith during our MLST interview last

854
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,760
time, this is mind physics, right? So, you know, a hallmark of

855
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,120
physics is idealization. And so, you know, necessarily some of

856
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,080
these constructs are going to be, you know, the map has to be

857
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,320
simpler than the territory, it's like we were saying, right?

858
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:09,680
You know, otherwise, you get you wind up in a boar has novel

859
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,680
with like, you know, a map the size of Los Angeles that you

860
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:17,600
can't use. So, you know, for certain kinds of oscillatory

861
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:21,400
cyclical bio behaviors, the non equilibrium steady state is a

862
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:29,360
perfectly fine, you know, model of it. You know, I drink coffee so

863
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,680
regularly that it might as well be like, you know, deterministic

864
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:36,840
and like, you know, orbiting the sun kind of thing. So, you

865
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,440
know, this speaks to the fact that the free energy principle

866
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,960
is what it says on the tin, it's a principle. It's a it's a that

867
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,160
leads to a modeling method. And you know, we make some

868
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:51,720
assumptions, and we're able to say some things. But the principle

869
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,440
itself doesn't rest on any of these assumptions. Like

870
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,480
stationarity, for example, like you don't really need that to

871
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,000
get it to get it working. All you need is a markup like it in

872
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,640
your random dynamical system and you're sort of ready to go. In

873
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,880
terms of like the formalization of the inactive approach, I

874
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:13,080
always saw this. So, like Chris, by the way, I think this is

875
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,880
under, I don't talk about it very much, but much like Chris, I

876
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,920
started off recalcitrant to the free energy principle. I found

877
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,160
out about this stuff in around 2014. And it, you know, like I

878
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,640
said, I was trained as an inactivist. And this really

879
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:33,640
conflicted with my intuitions. And I went into this thinking I

880
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:37,000
need to and this is also what I think the spirit that motivates

881
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,600
a lot of criticism, you go into this thinking I need to

882
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,040
understand this just enough to be able to know for sure that I

883
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,640
don't need to understand this actually. And, you know, you go

884
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,240
into this. And I, you know, I remember having like a conversion

885
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:56,120
experience reading Carl's 2012 entropy paper called a free

886
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,760
energy principle for biological systems, which was a path based

887
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,320
kind of formulation and everything and really, you know,

888
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:06,760
seeing, oh, wow, like, there's no, there's no resisting this,

889
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:09,760
like this is inevitable. And really getting like, oh, yeah,

890
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,440
this is an inevitable consequence of physics, isn't it? Like

891
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:16,000
there's no, there's no getting around this. And then kind of,

892
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,400
you know, doubling down in my conversion and then becoming a

893
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,440
part of the community.

894
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,280
So what's funny is I had the opposite experience of you two. So

895
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,240
I when I first saw it, I'm like, this is amazing. Like this is

896
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,080
exactly how it works. And now I've been trying to escape ever

897
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,440
since, you know, I don't like being shackled, like to the free

898
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,080
energy principle. And funny enough, we've talked before about

899
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,960
how, you know, Carl, that the free energy principle is one of

900
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,080
the few principles that applies to itself. It's like, as simple as

901
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,320
it is, it can be and still and still work. The other aspect in

902
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,400
which that's true is, as we've been talking about it maintains

903
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,080
this flexibility, or maybe vagueness, you know, critics

904
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:57,240
might say, but it maintains this flexibility, which leads to

905
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,680
it inevitably generating all kinds of controversy and debates,

906
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,440
you know, and people arguing about like the limits of that

907
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,560
flexibility, right?

908
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:08,480
One thing I would quickly point out is like, there's this

909
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,480
sense, I think in the literature that there are like 17

910
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,520
different possible interpretations of the free

911
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,120
energy principle, and that you can make it say one thing and

912
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,440
it's opposite. What I've been going around saying is no, that's

913
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,920
not correct. There's only the free energy principle. And it has

914
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,800
the implications that it does. And there are misinterpretations

915
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,560
of the free energy principle. So for example, you know, I

916
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,680
think this idea that some people in the literature have been

917
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,320
pushing that like the free energy principle is even compatible

918
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:41,120
with this kind of radical anti realism, this kind of, you

919
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:45,320
know, like a Descartes demon kind of thing. That's not that

920
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:48,280
just doesn't follow. It's incompatible with the math, like

921
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,240
the you need, you need there to be an actual world out there to

922
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,120
couple to you for the math to get off the ground. So there there

923
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:56,600
actually isn't a bunch of different interpretations. There's

924
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,840
just the free energy principle. It's just that it's a lens that

925
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:03,600
makes you makes you see that a lot of the dichotomies that use

926
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,160
to structure the way we think about things are false. This

927
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,360
comes back to the thing that we were discussing at the end of

928
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:13,920
our interview, Keith. This is sort of like a, you know, you're

929
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,960
sort of abolishing the distinction between the

930
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:19,960
super lunar re and the sub lunar spheres, right? So classical

931
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,520
mechanics abolishes the distinction that was popular

932
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:29,600
as scholastic philosophy, which was, you know, like 1000, 1500

933
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:34,360
years of like, you know, natural philosophy saying, well, I mean,

934
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,080
if you look at the way things behave, the things out there

935
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,920
beyond the moon in the super lunar sphere, right, they move in

936
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,160
perfect orbits, perfect circles, seems to have nothing to do

937
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,000
with, you know, things here that fall to the ground or rise and

938
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,720
have a beginning, a middle and an end. These seem like

939
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,800
radically distinct spheres of reality. But then Newton comes

940
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,720
along and classical mechanics equips you with a set of

941
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,560
equations that apply equally to things here and things over

942
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:06,360
there, thereby just abolishing that distinction. And I think

943
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:09,160
like the free energy principle comes around and does undoes a

944
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,760
lot of these false dichotomies in the same way, like we were

945
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,240
talking about internalism versus externalism, it allows you to

946
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,600
say, yeah, there's something to the internalist story, the

947
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,840
internal states are doing something special, but you

948
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:22,840
actually need the external world to be there to get the story to

949
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:27,560
kind of pick up. So I think you get a lot of this. And I guess

950
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,680
my hot tag is that the inactivists need there to

951
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,760
be a bright line in the universe, like a bright red line on the

952
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,520
one. And then what's on each side of the line depends on the

953
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,680
inactivists, right? So like, but the story is always something

954
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,920
like there's physics, there's mere physics on one side. And

955
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,000
then there's the interesting stuff on the other side, there's

956
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,360
biology, or maybe there's mind or there's something like that.

957
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:54,640
And there is this bright red line, like, yeah.

958
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,720
So Max, Maxwell is saying the free energy principle is the

959
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,080
ultimate shade of gray. I hope you

960
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:05,760
know, I know Tim, Tim, we wanted to move to a new topic.

961
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,960
Yeah, yeah, I mean, there's there's a few things to touch on

962
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,760
there. I mean, certainly the philosophy of, you know, an

963
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,840
activism versus ecological psychology is an interesting one

964
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,680
because with an activism, we get quite a few philosophical

965
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,400
things bagged on that possibly we may or may not want, for

966
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,240
example, the phenomenology, the existentialism, which is this

967
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,240
idea that you can shape your own experience, this kind of

968
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:34,040
Eastern philosophy, which is that in some sense, there's no

969
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:38,080
distinction between you and your environment. And it has been

970
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:42,080
criticized as being quite ill defined and vague. But I think

971
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,800
Maxwell, you have said that there's much more of a tighter

972
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,240
compatibility with ecological psychology. And that's essentially

973
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:52,720
that we see the world through affordances. And what that means

974
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,040
is that we see the world as trajectories of actions in our

975
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:01,000
physical environment that we live in. And philosophically,

976
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,600
that's a realist ontology. So that means there are no

977
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,400
representations, we're taking actions in the real world, and

978
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,760
we know that the real world exists. And now many cognitive

979
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,960
science people, of course, resist to this notion because they

980
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,640
say we need to have representations. And then we get to

981
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,560
this interesting discussion that we're having about this kind

982
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,240
of continuum between this idea that on the one hand, there are

983
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,360
no representations if we are Gibsonian, and we are

984
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:31,800
ecological psychologists. But on the other hand, we might need

985
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,720
to have increasing levels of representation if we actually

986
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:39,120
have this temporal depth, if we have these nested Markov

987
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:41,960
boundaries, and we are sophisticated minds that are

988
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,320
making predictions into the future. Now with that laid out, I

989
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:49,320
wanted to talk about this notion of goals. Now in a

990
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,640
externalist and activist framework, I think that goals

991
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:57,320
are not something we should explicitly define. Now when you

992
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,760
speak with go fi people, and they talk about building

993
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,520
cognitive architectures, they say that goals should be

994
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,520
explicitly crafted into the architecture, at least that's

995
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,040
what they would have said 20 years ago, now they're slightly

996
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,600
more refined. And they say, Well, we should have a goal module

997
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,520
in the architecture, but the goals should be acquired

998
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:19,200
empirically, and there should be sub goals and so on. Now, if I

999
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,200
understand correctly, we were just talking about the free

1000
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,600
energy principle has this notion of paths, and we have

1001
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:30,080
beliefs over trajectories of actions into the future. And to

1002
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:35,600
what extent is a belief a goal? Because if you have an almost

1003
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,800
infinite number of beliefs, so there's a trajectory to this

1004
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,880
future state where I'm rich, but there's also an infinitude of

1005
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,280
other potential trajectories. And they are of course constrained

1006
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,520
by the physical affordances and trajectories that I can take in

1007
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:54,680
my physical environment. That seems different to having an

1008
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,880
intention of wanting to be rich or wanting to play tennis,

1009
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:02,840
because I'm constrained in all of these different ways. So yeah,

1010
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,960
why don't we just talk about the dichotomy between beliefs and

1011
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:06,640
goals?

1012
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:11,720
I think Karl or Chris would be better equipped to answer the

1013
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,960
latter question. Karl in particular has been thinking

1014
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,000
about intentional behavior quite deeply recently. I did want to

1015
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,360
quickly comment upon ecological psychology. I have been saying

1016
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,160
to the eco psych community that Bayesian mechanics and eco

1017
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,520
psych are the same discipline. They're really the same thing.

1018
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:35,800
Vicente Raja is one of the cooler, more technically

1019
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:40,280
proficient people in the eco psych community. And after a few

1020
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:43,040
years of back and forth, we've realized that yeah, we're using

1021
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:46,320
exactly the same set of mathematical tools. The only

1022
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:50,160
framing is the only difference is a philosophical framing is, are

1023
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:55,000
you an indirectist or a directist? Right? So and I happen to

1024
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,880
think that these are just kind of semantic quibbles. If you look

1025
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,480
at the more contemporary eco psych literature, so the eco

1026
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:05,640
psych people are tend to be much more sophisticated, technically

1027
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,800
than the inactive people. And one thing that they have in

1028
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,440
common is that they don't reject information theory out of

1029
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,600
hand. They want the richer notion of information, like

1030
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:18,080
ecological information or semantic information, some kind

1031
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:21,800
of information that has some relevance to the environment,

1032
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:26,760
you know, the organisms like Melia, it's umvelt, it's, it's

1033
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:31,160
world of life. But they're not rejecting information theory. In

1034
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:35,400
fact, Gibson's original ambition was to apply physics to the

1035
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:39,240
study of perception just straight up. You know, so it's

1036
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,560
all about like, you know, energy, the, the energy on the

1037
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:46,040
perceptual arrays and all of this stuff. It's essentially, I

1038
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,360
think, the same project from a methodological and

1039
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,640
mathematical perspective. The main difference is just an

1040
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,080
inactive and a an ecological psychologist, sorry, would say

1041
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:00,480
that we perceive things directly. But then they appeal to

1042
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,000
this, these notions of like resonance and whatever, which

1043
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,600
you know, to us is just synonym for inference. I guess

1044
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:12,200
it's like it, the difference rests in like, are you centering

1045
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,760
on the internal perspective of an organism? Or are you looking

1046
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:19,120
at things as a multi scale stack with the organism kind of

1047
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:23,000
carving out one level? So we had a great session actually with

1048
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:28,400
Michael Anderson's Emerge Lab group, based out of Ontario. And

1049
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:34,600
my, my gut tells me that there will be a kind of strategic

1050
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:38,520
alliance, and maybe even just a merging of these two fields,

1051
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:43,920
moving forward. Yeah, and you know, for the more cynical part

1052
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,680
of me thinks that the merger of free energy principle and

1053
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,320
ecosystem gives you everything that you might want out of

1054
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:54,360
inactivism, but without any of the, you know, heavy, kind of

1055
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,360
metaphysical or philosophical baggage that seems to be, you

1056
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:02,240
know, hindering progress in that field. So that's my thing

1057
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:03,600
about eco psych.

1058
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:10,160
Okay, maybe we can bring you Chris in on the goals thing. So

1059
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,040
is, is a goal in end state? Is it a trajectory? Is it a

1060
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:19,080
bearing? And is it, is it, does it exist explicitly in the

1061
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:20,760
externalist view of cognition?

1062
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,760
Well, so I'm a kind of more of a practical, computational

1063
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:28,280
person. So I'll leave the philosophy to Maxwell. But I

1064
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,000
mean, I tend to take the intentional stats, intentional

1065
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,160
standards on systems, where if we can, if it makes sense for us

1066
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,840
to describe a system as a goal directed, then we should do so.

1067
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,160
And if that helps engineers to build those systems, then they

1068
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:45,360
they should do so, right? But there's a nice kind of, there's

1069
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:48,600
a nice parallel between those are kind of ideas and the original

1070
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,400
working cybernetics. So there's the, you know, the good

1071
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,760
regulator theorem, which this kind of early work by Conan and

1072
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:56,560
Ashby suggests that any, any control system of a given

1073
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,720
environment is a good model of the environment that it controls

1074
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:03,880
just by by necessity from first principles, right? Which to me,

1075
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:06,800
which we suggest that we should, in principle, be able to

1076
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:10,880
describe an intentional structure in terms of the kind of

1077
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,800
generative model within within a system, we should be able to

1078
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:16,960
find it if it is a good control system, and it should exist. I

1079
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,680
think there's also a more practical thing about shifting

1080
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,320
from the notion of reward as this kind of potential function

1081
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,200
that's kind of dominated the machine learning area, right? So

1082
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,440
we have this kind of monolithic thing of reward and everything

1083
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:32,240
is in in service of that reward to a richer notion of beliefs

1084
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,760
about dynamics, which which which affords that kind of, you

1085
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,880
know, moves away that potential function to a more kind of

1086
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,800
dynamical system so we can get more kind of rich beliefs about

1087
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:44,120
future trajectories and so on. And we know that in control

1088
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,360
systems, that's really, it's really important, right? If we

1089
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:49,560
want to control a system, we're doing model based control, we

1090
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,640
have to have desires on the futures of those systems, we need

1091
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:54,360
to understand the trajectory and the divergence of the

1092
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:56,760
trajectories over through time, right? So I think it's a much

1093
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:01,440
richer picture, practically, to think about, you know, beliefs

1094
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:05,080
about dynamics rather than reward. And I think there's this

1095
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,120
nice parallel between the intentional structure and the

1096
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,160
good regulator theory, because I think the good regulator

1097
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,200
theorem entails that we should find those kind of intentional

1098
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,760
dynamics within our systems, right? With just by a priori

1099
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,480
first reasoning.

1100
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,800
Yeah, I just want to know if he could explain the good

1101
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,400
regulator theorem, because I think that

1102
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,440
Yes, the good regulator theorem is really strong resonances

1103
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,720
with this. And I think, you know, there was a long, there was a

1104
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:29,080
long time, not Carl, the Carl's exclusive. It's a long time

1105
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,800
the people who were reading the free energy literature to think

1106
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:34,240
that they're kind of the roots of the free energy principle was

1107
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,160
in Helmholtz, Helmholtzian perception, right, this notion

1108
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,920
of Bayesian inference and perception. But there's kind of

1109
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,760
a much richer reading to see its roots in cybernetics movement,

1110
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,400
and particularly by the works of people like Ross Ashby and so

1111
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,440
on. So he basically said, he provided this theorem that

1112
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,400
showed that if you want to build a regulator for a given

1113
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,960
environmental system that optimally regulates that

1114
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:00,200
system, then it necessitates that regulator is a good model of

1115
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:03,600
that system, right? And there's a kind of you can take that in a

1116
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:07,040
strong way and a weak way and we worried about this for a long

1117
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:11,040
time. But just to diffuse that from its representational kind

1118
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,360
of implications, which we worried about for a long time, you

1119
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,720
can see this in something like even like the Watt-Gubner, which

1120
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,920
is used as his classic inactivist system that doesn't is

1121
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:23,080
nonrepresentationalist. But there are kind of there's a sense in

1122
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,400
which the dynamics of the Watt-Gubner needs to mirror the

1123
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:28,080
fluctuations of the the sea management regulating and it's

1124
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,680
that kind of coupling and that kind of reflection of those

1125
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,880
dynamics, which is important for the regulation of that system,

1126
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,480
right? So that kind of you can back out that, you know, I think

1127
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,760
this is very nice to line with the intentional stance and it

1128
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:44,600
demands an intentional stance. If you if you if you if you if

1129
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,520
you're committed to this notion of the good regulator,

1130
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:46,840
Ferriam.

1131
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,400
To riff on your point of the intentional son, I think that

1132
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,760
that's a fascinating way of looking at it, Chris. And to

1133
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:56,200
bring you in, Professor, Professor Daniel Dennett had

1134
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:00,560
this notion of the intentional stance, that when we, you know,

1135
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,600
we essentially have a mental model of the intentions of other

1136
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,800
agents. And we use that to understand their behavior. And

1137
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:11,320
an intention is a goal. If you think about it, it's something

1138
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:15,600
I want to do. But in this dynamical systems framework,

1139
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,680
it's not explicitly coded anywhere, it kind of emerges. And

1140
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:22,800
of course, it's a subjective state. So we've spoken about

1141
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,160
mental phenomenal states being encoded in our generative

1142
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:32,160
model in our in our free energy framework. And those states will

1143
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:37,000
of course have intentional, you know, representations of the

1144
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,840
other agents that we're dealing with. So I guess, the question

1145
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,080
back to you, Professor, for instance, how do you goals

1146
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,040
kind of get encoded in in this dynamics?

1147
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,520
Yeah, that's a great question. I know the answer you want,

1148
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:54,160
because you don't like goals, do you?

1149
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,840
I don't mind if they're I guess, I guess the answer is they're

1150
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,800
emergent, which is, which is

1151
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,640
exactly what I was hoping for that. Yes, they have to, you

1152
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:11,320
know, you have to find a physics where it looks as if there are

1153
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:14,640
goals, and they emerge from a particular kind of self

1154
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,480
organization. I think that's that's been beautifully

1155
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:21,080
illustrated just in the previous conversations you've had. And

1156
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:28,440
you know, ranging from the work of Ross Ashby on his homey

1157
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,800
stat, which I think would be better nowadays called an

1158
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,160
alofstat, but it would be to stick with the homey stat. Of

1159
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,920
course, you know, does homeostasis have a goal? Does my

1160
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,520
physiology have the goal of maintaining my temperature at

1161
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:44,400
37 degrees centigrade? It certainly looks like that. Do I

1162
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,800
intend to do that? Well, I think on one reading of intention,

1163
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:54,160
yes, you know, and certainly on an alofstatic reading of

1164
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,600
behaviors that have this temporal depth and are the

1165
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:03,880
consequence of plans into the future, you're putting turning

1166
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,720
on the thermostat or putting on clothes. I think then you're

1167
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,960
getting much closer to this sort of more anthropomorphic notion

1168
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,520
of intentionality, whether I think there are girls, there are

1169
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:21,240
there are endpoints. And so I guess that the question then is,

1170
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:24,240
you know, at what point would these different kinds of

1171
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:28,040
intentionality or goal directed behavior emerge from

1172
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:34,160
self organization? And in what particular kinds of systems would

1173
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:37,760
you expect to see this these these these behaviors? I think

1174
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,520
there's some fairly straightforward answers from the

1175
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:44,240
point of view of the physicist, not not the philosopher. So if

1176
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:49,640
you just look at the different kinds of systems that you could

1177
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:54,920
apply the free energy principle to, we've talked about one of

1178
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,800
them right at the beginning, when considering Markov

1179
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:02,760
blankets that did not have any have any internal states, for

1180
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:06,560
example, a stone. Yeah, so every state of this thing is just a

1181
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,400
Markov blanket, and it is in reciprocal exchange with the

1182
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:13,920
external states. So that would be when the internal states are

1183
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,280
empty. Well, there are other kinds of systems that you could

1184
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,400
have. Well, you could imagine systems that didn't have any

1185
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:24,680
active states. But, you know, most interesting systems do

1186
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:28,720
have active states. And then you ask about the rounded

1187
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:32,240
contribution of these random fluctuations to the dynamics of

1188
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:35,640
you know, the self organization. And if you just follow the

1189
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:42,080
maths through the pathogenical, in particular, maths of the

1190
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,600
dynamics that any system at a particular temporal scale must

1191
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:52,400
have, if it's internal or autonomous dynamics, or the

1192
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:56,240
dynamics, the flows of the internal states and the

1193
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:59,360
the blanket states that constitute a particle or a person,

1194
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:04,160
when they become sufficiently precise. So when we become big

1195
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:10,080
enough, and cool enough, so let's assume that we're bigger than

1196
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:13,200
a quantum scale, but not too big to become classical. So we're

1197
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,720
not the size of the moon, but we are roughly your size and my

1198
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:21,080
size, or perhaps the size of a mouse or an insect through to an

1199
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:25,480
elephant or a giraffe. Then you have this interesting

1200
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:28,320
situation of these very precise dynamics, and they're precise

1201
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,000
just because we are big. So all the random fluctuations are

1202
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,480
averaged away. In this particular case, then you can

1203
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,520
you can show that these particular kinds of things or

1204
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,360
Markov blankets have a very well defined probability

1205
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,960
distribution over paths into the future, specifically the

1206
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,040
paths of the active states. So let's assume that there are

1207
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:54,240
certain kinds of particles or creatures that have active

1208
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:59,200
states and they have, you know, they and the blanket states

1209
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:03,360
enshroud a sufficient number of internal states. What would

1210
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:06,800
they look like if they had very precise dynamics? Well, you can

1211
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,120
actually work out the probability distribution over the

1212
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:12,440
active states that over their actions, over their movements,

1213
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:14,120
and these could be physiological movements,

1214
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:17,200
autonomic reflexes, they could be physical movements, eye

1215
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:21,560
movements, or for ambulatory movements, indeed even talking.

1216
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:28,400
And it transpires that the probability distribution over

1217
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,680
these particular paths of active states has an interesting

1218
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:36,080
functional form when written in terms of the potential of the

1219
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:40,400
log probability, we call that an expected free energy. And that

1220
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:45,480
expected free energy, when you just write it down, passes into

1221
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:51,040
or come can be decomposed into things that people have been

1222
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:57,240
dealing with for centuries, specifically, the expected

1223
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:01,840
information gain, and the expected reward or utility where

1224
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:10,080
reward or utility is scored by the log probability of occupying

1225
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:13,560
an attractive state or rewarding state. And I use the word

1226
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:18,080
attractive state deliberately because it is just part of the

1227
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:25,200
pullback attractor that affords the application of the

1228
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:28,920
pathological formulation. It's just the characteristic states

1229
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:32,720
and this kind of thing occupies. So the the guleness, if you

1230
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:40,560
like, is is inherent in the characteristics of the particle

1231
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,120
or person that you're trying to describe. So for certain kinds

1232
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:47,600
of particles or persons, then it will certainly look as if they

1233
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:53,160
are acting with long term vision, namely planning in a way to

1234
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:57,000
return themselves to their attracting set, which you could

1235
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,120
look you could now regard as a goal or a rewarded or at least

1236
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:09,640
an attracting an attracting outcome or or state of being. So I

1237
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:14,920
think that kind of particle starts to now show the the deep

1238
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,560
intention, you know, it looks as if they are they are doing this

1239
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,840
because they intend some outcome. I think the next step,

1240
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,080
though, which is the one that you were speaking to possibly done

1241
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:28,600
then it was implying is another, I think, step, which is, but

1242
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:32,560
does the does the internal state know that? You know, am I

1243
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:37,840
aware that I am planning? And of course, that calls upon very,

1244
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,760
very sophisticated, so if they exist, internal or generative

1245
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:47,640
models that entail a model of me and the hypothesis that all of

1246
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:52,040
this, these sensations and all the consequences of my actions,

1247
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:58,720
which I am not aware of. You know, I cannot feel all the

1248
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,240
sensory, not sensory, all the neuronal impulses that cause my

1249
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:08,680
muscles to contract. All I can register is the consequences of

1250
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:12,320
that through my muscle, my stretch receptors, my proprioceptive

1251
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:17,120
receptors, or if it's in my gut or my autonomic intraceptive

1252
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:22,520
receptors. So I don't know what I'm I can't I can't have I do

1253
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:26,600
have have no access to my actual action. But I can see the

1254
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:31,000
consequences of it and it looks as if I'm planning. So I now have

1255
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:36,600
a hypothesis or a fantasy that I am a thing. And I seem to have

1256
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:41,200
goals. And if I can learn the kinds of goals that I have, then I

1257
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:46,320
can now start to mentalize and have notions in my generative

1258
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:50,000
model about my goals. And then I can notice, oh, you have goals,

1259
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,800
or perhaps it's the other way around. Perhaps the first of all,

1260
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,840
it looks as if the explanation for this random dynamical system

1261
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:00,400
over here called mom is actually, but she looks as if she

1262
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:04,720
plans, it looks as if she has goals. And then a few years later,

1263
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:07,200
if I develop a sense of self, well, perhaps I'm a thing like

1264
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,880
mom, but perhaps I have goals. So I think that you're, you're

1265
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,600
from the point of view of Dandenit's intentional stance, I

1266
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:18,280
think we're talking about a very, very particular kind of system

1267
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:23,320
that actually has this capacity to recognize, first of all,

1268
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:28,080
intentional like behaviors, long term planning dynamics in other

1269
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:32,640
things, or things like itself, and then actually transcribe that

1270
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,400
and test the hypothesis, well, perhaps I'm a thing like that as

1271
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:36,880
well. Perhaps I'm me.

1272
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,960
And what's beautiful about what you just said there, and all

1273
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,440
three of you have said this in different different ways. So I

1274
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:47,120
want to dwell on this just a bit, because I think it's a source

1275
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,640
of the misunderstanding and or controversy about the free

1276
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:53,960
energy principles. So earlier Maxwell, you had said, you know,

1277
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:58,040
it's really a model about the couplings and the isolations

1278
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,880
together, the couplings and the decouplings and the dynamics

1279
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:05,920
between them. You know, Carl, you just said, systems will behave

1280
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:09,760
as if they had intentions, whether or not they really have

1281
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,960
intentions or not is kind of a different philosophical question,

1282
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,440
but they'll behave as if they had intentions. And Chris, you

1283
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:19,320
brought up, you know, the watt governor, which is, it's, it's

1284
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,520
obviously a very simple dynamic system, you know, spinning

1285
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:26,480
centrifuge and, you know, arm bar, like whatever else. And yet,

1286
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,160
it's, it's not as though it's a literal model in the sense that

1287
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:33,080
I'm going to have a mathematical, mathematical model for what

1288
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:37,720
the steam engine is doing, but it's behaving as if it were an

1289
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:40,400
effective model of the steam engine, because hey, when it's

1290
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:43,720
slightly out of sync, the arm flexes a little bit, it readjust

1291
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:46,920
it's, you know, the spin changes slightly, things continue to

1292
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:51,080
work because if it didn't have the dynamics that were as if it

1293
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:54,080
had a model, the thing wouldn't function, would just fall apart.

1294
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,720
So I guess what we're all, what's all being said here is that

1295
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:01,960
systems at different scales will behave as if they had a model,

1296
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:05,840
even if they don't necessarily have a model in the sense of a

1297
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:09,760
person, like a person might have a conscious model from which

1298
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,320
they develop a plan or whatnot, but all these systems of varying

1299
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:17,680
scales and complexity still behave as if they had a model. They

1300
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:22,000
act to minimize the free energy as a consequence of, you know,

1301
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,960
being random dynamical systems that are self maintaining.

1302
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,720
Yeah, I think that's really eloquently put. And actually,

1303
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,520
that's this is this to kind of underwrite some of the worries

1304
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,960
we had about the principle, when we first started walking on

1305
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,080
working on it as kind of coming from an activist or a low road

1306
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,760
an activist, this notion of kind of an explicit

1307
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,440
representationalism that you can you can get in these models

1308
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,720
where the model is a homomorphic with the environment, right?

1309
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:50,480
And I just just it rankles people who've come from behavior

1310
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,960
based robotics and stuff like this. But then to kind of

1311
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:56,240
realize that there's a richer relationship between the

1312
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:59,120
internal thing, external that's been mirrored, right? It

1313
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,560
doesn't have to be this homomorphic mapping. And also,

1314
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,720
the you know, the actions are deeply involved in carving out

1315
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:08,840
the world that you represent, you live in your own vault. You're

1316
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,200
a model of your own vault, you're a model of regulating your

1317
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,720
own vault, which is not, you know, it's not just like this

1318
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,400
static separation of the of the agent from its environment,

1319
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,280
there's this deep coupling, which, which can, you know, which

1320
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:23,640
these kind of mirrorings emerge from. But yeah, I think you

1321
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:24,840
articulated it really well there.

1322
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:26,960
Can we just

1323
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,040
I saw Carl, any comments here?

1324
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:34,080
No, I think you did a great job. I agree with Chris, like that.

1325
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:34,360
Yeah.

1326
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:39,360
So I think we've got about 15 minutes left. So we'll do two

1327
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,960
more topics. We'll end on structural learning and the

1328
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,880
practical implementations of the free energy principle. But I

1329
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:46,800
just wanted to touch on what you were talking about earlier,

1330
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,280
Maxwell, which is this notion of the boundaries being

1331
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:52,200
potentially vague, or maybe even observer relative. Now, in

1332
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:56,200
your multi scale paper, you did say, use the word ontological

1333
01:21:56,200 --> 01:22:01,280
boundaries, I think. And I also wanted to talk about meaning. So

1334
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:05,400
there's the boundaries of cognition in the physical

1335
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,560
world. So we have this dynamical system, and it kind of

1336
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:11,320
converges and we've got these nested kind of hierarchy of

1337
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:15,160
boundaries. But then in a kind of Dennett sense, meaning

1338
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:18,680
emerges gradually and the meaning kind of depends on your

1339
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:23,120
perspective. And the intentional stance also depends on your

1340
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:26,280
perspective. So different agents could look at different

1341
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,920
phenomena going on in their physical environment, and they

1342
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:32,600
could describe different meaning in their generative models. So

1343
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,960
we seem to have this kind of weird two tier system where no

1344
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:38,560
longer are we even saying that the boundaries, the marker

1345
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,800
boundaries are fixed, they are potentially variable. And then

1346
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:45,520
the way that the agents construct meaning is also

1347
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,280
observer dependent. And all of this is kind of touching on what

1348
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:52,320
I was saying before with goals, which is that the reason they

1349
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:55,840
emerge is because they are unintelligible, they're extremely

1350
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:01,240
complex. Do you see what I mean? So it feels like the reason why

1351
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,760
we need to have this high resolution generative model is

1352
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:06,440
because in principle, it would be impossible for us to

1353
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,760
explicitly program it.

1354
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,560
So a few quick things about that. I mean, I think you're

1355
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:21,240
you're really identifying some of the key issues. I would first

1356
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:26,920
so with respect to ontology, I would, you know, distinguish

1357
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:32,080
ontology from metaphysics. ontology is just talking about

1358
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,760
what kind of things are. So when we say that the boundaries are

1359
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:40,880
ontological, what we're saying is we're trying to capture kind

1360
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:45,800
of features of the map, in some sense. And you know, what we've

1361
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:49,680
argued in a paper recently is that the free energy principle is

1362
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:53,120
metaphorically speaking, a map of that part of the territory

1363
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:58,320
that behaves like a map. So I want to contrast this with

1364
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,200
metaphysics in the sense that like this is all of this is a

1365
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:06,880
modeling approach. This is a physics. This isn't saying like

1366
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:10,440
once and for all, these boundaries are here and

1367
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:17,040
crystallized and just, you know, are there independently of,

1368
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:21,160
you know, the way that we are experiencing or sampling or

1369
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:25,000
interacting with the world, like that that kind of metaphysical

1370
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,440
stuff is not what's at stake. Yeah, so in the paper you're

1371
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:33,600
referring to, we describe we describe these Markov blankets

1372
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:37,320
as existential boundaries, in the sense that they're both

1373
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:41,040
epistemological and ontological. They're ontological in the

1374
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:45,320
sense that they are definitional of what a thing is, in this

1375
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:49,200
kind of physics based approach, if you can pick out a thing as a

1376
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:55,840
physical thing, then it has to have this blanket structure. And

1377
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:58,600
it's it's epistemological in the sense that it's this

1378
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:02,840
interface, right? Like the thing itself can only know the world

1379
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:06,840
and indeed, we can only know the world, the thing through this

1380
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:11,960
boundary. So like this isn't meant to be a priori. It's

1381
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:15,080
sort of weird. It's in some sense, it's sort of like an app

1382
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:18,600
posteriori. It's like an empirically driven way to

1383
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,720
carve up the world.

1384
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:25,560
That's fine. I mean, on that, I think that that answers my

1385
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:29,760
question, because there's always this confusion about whether

1386
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:34,080
we're talking about the map or the territory. And just to be

1387
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,640
clear, we are we are always talking about the map when we

1388
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,920
talk about these boundaries.

1389
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:41,480
Yeah, the free energy principle is a map of the boundaries you

1390
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:45,040
can think of and a map of what happens when things have

1391
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:49,320
boundaries that it and so yeah, that that that is important to

1392
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:52,320
keep in mind, like we don't want to engage in map territory

1393
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:56,640
fallacies. The free energy principle is a model, it's a

1394
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:59,680
scientific model, and it's a map and it turns out to be

1395
01:25:59,720 --> 01:26:02,920
the canonical way of modeling systems that are engaged in

1396
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:07,280
modeling. So if maximum entropy is the canonical way of

1397
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:12,400
modeling physical systems in physics, it's the way of arriving

1398
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:16,520
at the most parsimonious model that generates, you know, some

1399
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:20,920
data set, right? Well, the free energy principle is equally a

1400
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:25,320
canonical way of modeling systems that also in turn seem to

1401
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:28,120
be engaged in this kind of modeling behavior. But yeah,

1402
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:33,160
it's a model, it's a map, you know, this probably is not the

1403
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:37,600
final word. And, you know, we're, we're uncovering some, you

1404
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:41,160
know, mathematical structure underneath the free energy

1405
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:45,400
principle and the principle of unitarity and maximum caliber and

1406
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,480
all of this stuff that we're tentatively calling G theory for

1407
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:54,200
now in homage to M theory from string theory physics. So yeah,

1408
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:58,520
you know, as most scientific models, like the progress of

1409
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:02,480
science means that things will probably change. Like again, this

1410
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:07,760
isn't a metaphysics. This is just a cohesive modeling approach

1411
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,720
that inherits from the physics of information and self

1412
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:17,240
organization. I would quickly just point out that the these

1413
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:20,920
things like seem intrinsically related to observer

1414
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:25,440
dependence, because they are in some deep sense. Carl's 2019

1415
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:29,440
monograph, a particular free energy principle for a particular

1416
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:33,960
physics ends on this idea that the free energy principle at core

1417
01:27:33,960 --> 01:27:37,840
is a metrological statement, where metrological means measure

1418
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:41,120
theoretic or relating to measurement. And it basically

1419
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:44,200
says, Well, things that exist, look as if they're constantly

1420
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:47,320
measuring themselves and like keeping themselves within

1421
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:51,320
certain bounds. So this is and you know, this is even clearer

1422
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:54,360
from the quantum information theoretic formulation, where

1423
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,000
like literally what we're saying is that the free energy

1424
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,240
principle is a theory of observance, you know, the sort

1425
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:05,280
of the it from bit, right? Like the it's thing this, but from

1426
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,360
another perspective, it's observance, which which are kind

1427
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:12,000
of the same thing. I'm sure Carl could say that again, more

1428
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,960
eloquently than I. But at a high level, that's how I would

1429
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:16,980
respond to your point.

1430
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:25,920
Maybe Carl would like to give it a go. Yeah, Carl, you could do

1431
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:29,600
that. And then also, since you're trying to decide if you're

1432
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,080
an activist, you know, maybe, what other questions do we need

1433
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:36,040
to ask for both of us actually to decide, you know, that we

1434
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,120
haven't, that we haven't covered yet?

1435
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:42,080
Yeah, we can we can ask Max, well, and Chris, to.

1436
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:49,840
So just to pick up on that last exchange and come back to the

1437
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:54,720
free energy principle as being gloriously gray. I think I like

1438
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:59,840
that because, you know, the validity of that principle as

1439
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,720
a method. So, you know, as a physicist, you would read any

1440
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,360
principle as a method, something that you apply to some

1441
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:11,040
thing. I think is is underwritten, not by its

1442
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:14,960
explanatory scope, but by its internal consistency with other

1443
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:19,480
principles that that people do apply. And I'm, that's what is

1444
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:23,640
mentioned one. I think one important example of that, you

1445
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:27,680
know, beyond the principles of least actual variational

1446
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:30,080
principles that underwrite for, you know,

1447
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:35,280
say Richard Feynman's work. I'm thinking of James's maximum

1448
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,480
entropy principle. So Max well alluded to that in terms of

1449
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:43,120
maximum caliber. So maximum entropy of distributions over

1450
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,640
states just now becomes transformed into distributions

1451
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:52,520
over paths when you move from when you move to the maximum

1452
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,760
caliber principle. So the maximum entropy principle is

1453
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:00,080
just a Max Janssen Max entropy principle for a pathological

1454
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:04,080
formulation. And I think that's important to raise. The free

1455
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,680
energy principle just is that it is just a constrained maximum

1456
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:10,880
caliber principle or maximum entropy principle. And you may

1457
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:13,280
ask, well, where did the constraints from come from? That's

1458
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,840
just the generative model. It's just in the description of the

1459
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,640
characteristic states that pull back a tractor that constitutes

1460
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,680
the goals of the principle. And I think that's important to

1461
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,640
realise the free energy principle just is that it is just a

1462
01:30:24,720 --> 01:30:28,560
that constitutes the goals we're just talking about. So, you

1463
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:32,080
know, if you remember, free energy is just the expected energy,

1464
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:38,160
the constraint part plus the entropy. And therefore, when

1465
01:30:38,160 --> 01:30:41,600
you're now drilling down on the constraint part, where does that

1466
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,320
come from? It's just a description of the pullback

1467
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:46,800
attractor of the characteristic states of the system that you're

1468
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:50,720
trying to try to understand. So I really look at the free

1469
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:53,600
energy principle as something terribly new. It's been

1470
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,720
implicit there all the time. It's just people using slightly

1471
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:00,560
different words for different concepts. So I think that's I

1472
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:03,440
kind of why I'm saying this, but it seemed important to say.

1473
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:07,280
And Max, what were you just talking about? Because there was

1474
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:08,880
a link in terms of

1475
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:12,960
were you maybe leading into the metrological aspects, the

1476
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:13,760
self measurement?

1477
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,040
Absolutely. I know that was really important. Yes, that's

1478
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:22,720
right. So just looking backwards. What is the the sibling

1479
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:31,280
of the, or the sibling of the free energy principle of in the

1480
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:34,960
past century, in the past few decades, I think that would be

1481
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,280
the maximum entropy principle, constraint maximum

1482
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:41,280
entropy principle. Looking forwards, what would be the

1483
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:44,480
bedfellows of the free energy principle? I think that the

1484
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:51,120
that metrological or relational thing is vitally important.

1485
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,840
And, you know, I love the work of

1486
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,480
Carlo Revelli and his work with, you know,

1487
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:04,480
quantum relational approaches to quantum mechanics, which is

1488
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:08,240
all about relationships. And of course, how do you how do you

1489
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:12,160
quantify a relationship? Well, it's just in terms of the

1490
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,320
interaction, the coupling, which is going to be a sparse

1491
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,480
coupling, it is just a measurement, it is just an

1492
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:20,880
observation. So inference, measurement, synchronization,

1493
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:25,520
sparse coupling, they're all the same thing. And so I think

1494
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,920
that what will hopefully happen is that somebody will write

1495
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:32,560
down a math possibly Dalton will write down a calculus that

1496
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:34,960
says all of these things are just the same way of looking at

1497
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:38,480
it. And I read yesterday, because I had to because I was

1498
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:42,480
reviewing this paper for Synthese, about ontic structural

1499
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:47,280
realism, ontic structural realism. And it seems to me that

1500
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:50,080
that is basically philosophers having discovered the same

1501
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:55,040
underlying fabric that the reality is in the measurement,

1502
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:58,800
but it's the measurement of how we relate to each other via

1503
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:03,680
that measurement of each other or things, measuring other

1504
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:08,480
things, purely in terms of their relationships. So I think

1505
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:13,840
that there is a lot of, if you like, work to be done from the

1506
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:19,360
point of view of free energy principle theorists in consolidating

1507
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:22,080
the links to what has gone in terms of things like maximum

1508
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:25,040
entry principle, and what is to come in terms of, say,

1509
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:29,200
quantum loop gravity or Chris Fields quantum information

1510
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:32,240
theoretic treatment of holographic screens in the

1511
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:37,760
Markov blanket. At each point, the FEP will become grayer

1512
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,600
because it will be less easy to discriminate it from

1513
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,840
everything else that stood the test of time.

1514
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:47,600
Chris, do you have any comments on that?

1515
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:51,840
You're on mute. You're on mute yet.

1516
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:58,240
You're on mute, Chris. Sorry. So yeah, I think I'll leave it

1517
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:00,320
there. It's a bit too deep into the philosophy for me, and

1518
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:03,520
we've got two experts here, so I'll pass.

1519
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:07,840
Wonderful. And to my point earlier, I mean, we won't go

1520
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,920
into it now, but I guess my perspective is it all seems

1521
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:16,480
like epistemology to me rather than ontology, and maybe we

1522
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:21,040
can debate that a little bit later on. But as our uploads

1523
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:24,000
are all quite slow, and I want to check that we secure this

1524
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,680
beautiful interview, I'm going to cut it off at this point,

1525
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:30,480
but gentlemen, it's been an absolute honor. Thank you so

1526
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:32,800
much for coming on MLS here. Thank you so much to me.

1527
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:37,200
Genuinely, always a pleasure, gentlemen. This is always great fun.

1528
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:43,200
Beautiful. Beautiful. Yeah, I always enjoyed it.
