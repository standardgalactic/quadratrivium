WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.120
Yeah, we're just like backups. We love net net Netflix

00:04.120 --> 00:07.440
quality productions. Okay, well, in which case, let's kick

00:07.440 --> 00:10.080
off. So we've we've had a couple of technical problems

00:10.080 --> 00:12.600
with the stream. So now we're going to go pre recorded

00:12.600 --> 00:15.800
instead, which is absolutely fine. So we're going to talk

00:15.800 --> 00:19.360
about quite a few things today. Now, one big theme, I think

00:19.360 --> 00:23.600
is talking about an activism and the kind of compatibility

00:23.920 --> 00:27.360
between the free energy principle and an activism. We're

00:27.360 --> 00:31.000
going to talk about. Now we have to be very careful how we

00:31.000 --> 00:35.480
pronounce this words auto poetic. Is that right, Maxwell?

00:35.600 --> 00:39.480
That's right. Yes. Amazing. So forgive me when I get it

00:39.480 --> 00:42.320
wrong. I'm going to get it wrong. I'm sorry. So we're

00:42.320 --> 00:44.920
talking about auto poetic and activism, which of which, of

00:44.920 --> 00:49.280
course, was the brainchild of Varela. And there's an

00:49.280 --> 00:51.320
interesting paper that came out, which was actually quite

00:51.320 --> 00:54.320
critical of FEP. We're going to talk about some of the points

00:54.320 --> 00:56.480
in that paper. And that was called laying down a forking

00:56.480 --> 00:59.720
path tensions between an action and the free energy principle.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.640
And in that paper, there were a few areas. So there was the

01:02.640 --> 01:07.160
definition of auto poesis, historicity. So we're talking

01:07.160 --> 01:11.240
about temporal sequence invariance and non steady state

01:11.240 --> 01:15.440
equilibria and what it means to be a Goddick. There was this

01:15.520 --> 01:18.400
critique about the non stationarity of distributions.

01:18.560 --> 01:21.280
And also really interesting discussion about internalism

01:21.320 --> 01:24.600
versus externalism, because of course, the the inactive view

01:24.600 --> 01:29.040
is is is a form of externalised cognition, which is this very

01:29.040 --> 01:32.960
interesting view that you have cognizizing elements outside

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
of the mind in the environment around you. So we'll talk about

01:36.000 --> 01:38.760
that as well. We'll touch on goal directedness and also

01:38.760 --> 01:41.840
structure learning, which is a really, really exciting thing

01:41.840 --> 01:45.800
in in any any Bayesian cognitive framework. Now on the call

01:45.800 --> 01:48.520
today, we have obviously, first of all, Professor Karl

01:48.520 --> 01:52.080
Friston, the inventor of the free energy principle and active

01:52.080 --> 01:55.120
inference, a man who requires no introduction whatsoever.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.920
Professor Friston, welcome to the show.

01:57.960 --> 01:58.760
Great to be back.

02:01.480 --> 02:05.680
Fabulous. We also have Dr. Maxwell Ramstead, one of the top

02:05.680 --> 02:08.800
scholars in the free energy principle and the active

02:08.800 --> 02:11.240
inference literature. Of course, we've had Maxwell on very

02:11.240 --> 02:12.920
recently, but welcome back Maxwell.

02:13.800 --> 02:14.840
Always a pleasure, gentlemen.

02:15.240 --> 02:18.680
Amazing. And we also have a new face. Professor Buckley, would

02:18.680 --> 02:19.840
you like to introduce yourself?

02:20.800 --> 02:24.720
Yeah, yeah. So yeah, my I'm a faculty member at the University

02:24.720 --> 02:30.200
of Sussex, but I also work with versus with Maxwell and Karl. So

02:30.200 --> 02:33.680
I have a background originally in physics in postgraduate in

02:33.680 --> 02:36.960
physics, and then moved into cognitive robotics. I was kind

02:36.960 --> 02:41.880
of working in behavior based robotics, and an activism somewhat

02:41.880 --> 02:46.240
early on my my PhD, moved into kind of theoretical neuroscience,

02:46.480 --> 02:49.400
and kind of really got interested in the free energy

02:49.440 --> 02:53.640
principle about eight or nine or so years ago and wrote a review

02:53.640 --> 02:57.960
on it. Originally, you know, wanted to challenge it and

02:57.960 --> 02:59.920
then eventually fell in love with it and now think it's the

02:59.920 --> 03:04.560
right way to go for it for what we want to do. So I came as a

03:04.560 --> 03:08.560
skeptic and then have been bashed into into into place. Do you

03:08.560 --> 03:11.640
think now this is is the correct way to think about things?

03:12.240 --> 03:15.880
Amazing. Well, let's let the bashing commence. Well, we'll

03:15.880 --> 03:18.680
move straight on to the subject of an activism. So there is this

03:18.680 --> 03:21.480
paper laying down a forking path tensions between an action and

03:21.480 --> 03:24.000
the free energy principle. And the name is very hard to

03:24.000 --> 03:28.600
pronounce it as Esquiel de Paolo. Paolo.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.560
Okay, thank you so much. Now, just just to be fair to them,

03:35.960 --> 03:40.480
because Maxwell, you did actually couch FEP as an activism 2.0,

03:40.960 --> 03:47.160
despite the inactivist rejection of information methods. And maybe

03:47.160 --> 03:51.240
we should start by defining an activism. And also, there's some

03:51.240 --> 03:55.480
similarities with this other idea called ecological psychology.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.680
So why don't why don't we just start by framing some of these

03:58.680 --> 03:59.440
ideas up?

04:01.840 --> 04:04.280
That sounds good. Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.520
Did you have like a pre prepared definition you wanted to

04:08.520 --> 04:10.720
share? Do you want us to riff on this?

04:11.600 --> 04:15.360
Well, why don't why don't we start with Varela's an activism?

04:15.760 --> 04:20.640
So there are some so it's in terms of philosophy, there are hints

04:20.640 --> 04:24.240
of existentialism and phenomenology and eastern influences

04:24.240 --> 04:28.080
and focus on lived experience and stuff like that. One of the and

04:28.080 --> 04:31.880
the core things is that they reject information processing and

04:31.880 --> 04:35.360
computationalism. They focus on actions and interactions.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.720
It's a very embodied tradition. So why don't we just kind of

04:39.760 --> 04:40.520
start with that?

04:41.400 --> 04:45.120
Okay, yeah, that's a great way to set it up. Well, I mean, we should

04:45.120 --> 04:49.280
probably just add a little bit of context and a few caveats

04:49.280 --> 04:53.640
before launching into this. So I think Chris and I are of the

04:53.640 --> 04:58.320
generation that was trained in the inactive embodied tradition.

04:59.320 --> 05:03.080
I would describe myself as a reformed inactivist. I don't

05:03.080 --> 05:07.440
know if Chris, you resonate with that I still believe in

05:07.440 --> 05:08.200
activism. Yeah.

05:09.160 --> 05:15.160
So these, the inactive approach is one of the so called four e

05:15.200 --> 05:19.600
approaches that have become very popular since the 90s. And I

05:19.600 --> 05:23.080
would argue is, at least in in the more philosophically

05:23.080 --> 05:26.480
informed corners of cognitive science and neuroscience, basically

05:26.480 --> 05:32.680
the dominant theoretical paradigm right now. So it we have to

05:32.680 --> 05:36.520
say there's a this is a broad church of approaches that go

05:36.600 --> 05:42.760
from a more kind of minimalist recognition that cognition

05:42.800 --> 05:47.360
involves bodily processes to the more radical approaches that

05:47.360 --> 05:51.880
you were describing earlier that just wholesale reject

05:52.560 --> 05:56.400
information theory, the computation, the computational

05:56.440 --> 06:00.000
metaphor for mind that mind is basically a kind of computing

06:00.000 --> 06:05.600
device. And yeah, the inactive approach grew out of

06:05.680 --> 06:10.120
auto poetic theory. They're distinct. It's important to say.

06:10.360 --> 06:16.160
So auto poetic theory was developed by Maturana and Barrela

06:16.680 --> 06:23.840
sometime in the 1980s and 90s. And it was a very mechanistic

06:23.840 --> 06:29.280
approach to mind. I mean, you know, some of the early kind of

06:29.280 --> 06:33.800
flagship papers in this tradition are what the frogs I

06:33.840 --> 06:36.600
tells the frogs brain and this kind of stuff. So you know, hard

06:36.600 --> 06:43.960
nose kind of systems biology type thinking. And I mean, there

06:43.960 --> 06:51.200
was basically a break in the literature where due to Barrela

06:51.240 --> 06:56.000
in a lot of ways, the emphasis moving from kind of mechanistic

06:56.000 --> 07:01.040
models to phenomenology to a kind of more dynamic, coupling

07:01.040 --> 07:06.080
interactive kind of mode of explanation. So yeah, the inactive

07:06.080 --> 07:09.840
approach is basically committed to this idea, fundamentally that

07:10.520 --> 07:13.880
cognition is basically bringing about a world, a structured

07:13.880 --> 07:19.080
world of meaning and significance through adaptive

07:19.120 --> 07:26.080
appropriate actions left in the world. So the the slogan is, you

07:26.080 --> 07:32.080
know, yeah, exactly constructing this meaning, you know, laying

07:32.080 --> 07:35.280
down a path and walking, I think is the the slogan, the poetic

07:35.280 --> 07:42.040
slogan form that's so popular. Yeah, and in its more radical

07:42.040 --> 07:46.960
inclinations, this inactive approach says, dynamical

07:46.960 --> 07:53.600
systems is really the way to study systems that have mind. And

07:53.640 --> 07:57.080
so the kind of the background assumption there is that there's

07:57.080 --> 08:00.640
a fork in the path in the road somewhere, you know, where we

08:00.640 --> 08:05.200
have to choose between information theory and dynamics. And

08:05.200 --> 08:10.200
yet they obviously go down the dynamics path. So I think that's

08:10.200 --> 08:13.640
a setup. And before launching into criticism, I should say that

08:13.640 --> 08:17.720
we as a community, genuinely appreciate and benefit from

08:17.920 --> 08:22.720
friendly critical engagement. So I just want to caveat all this

08:22.720 --> 08:26.000
by saying that the criticism comes from a place of wanting to

08:26.000 --> 08:31.120
build community from a place from our hearts, basically. And

08:31.240 --> 08:34.680
yeah, although I'm going to be saying a lot of critical stuff

08:34.680 --> 08:38.760
about the inactive approach. In my heart, I'm an inactivist, I

08:38.760 --> 08:45.080
think just that the a lot of the, a lot of the methodology and

08:45.080 --> 08:49.280
explanatory constructs that are leveraged in the approach are

08:49.360 --> 08:52.240
problematic. And in particular, you see this come out when

08:52.720 --> 08:56.800
the free energy principle comes into play. So

08:56.840 --> 08:59.600
So Chris, do you want to add anything to that that definition?

08:59.600 --> 09:03.440
Yeah, I mean, I guess it's like, I see, I'm going to use this kind

09:03.440 --> 09:07.800
of phraseology was in in one of Carl's books, which is a low

09:07.800 --> 09:12.080
road and a high road and activism. I basically was brought up a

09:12.080 --> 09:15.080
low road and activist rights. So this is kind of rejection of

09:15.080 --> 09:18.600
representationalism in cognitive architectures. It was a

09:18.600 --> 09:21.280
move away from good old fashioned artificial intelligence to

09:21.280 --> 09:25.120
embedded and embodied agents. So this is kind of the origin in

09:25.120 --> 09:28.560
Rodney Brooks's behavior based approaches to robotics. And

09:28.560 --> 09:31.760
those are the kinds of ideas I still embrace. And then there's

09:31.920 --> 09:35.560
the kind of high road and activism, which kind of embraces

09:35.560 --> 09:39.520
auto pieces and operational closure at its heart. I mean,

09:39.560 --> 09:42.880
to me, I mean, if you're if you're a high road and activists,

09:42.880 --> 09:45.680
they are the same thing, they are they come from the same place.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.520
But I think there's a kind of there is a there are messages

09:48.520 --> 09:50.760
to take from an activism and the low road, which are super

09:50.760 --> 09:53.480
important for cognition, right, without kind of going into the

09:53.480 --> 09:57.880
depths of the auto poesis. Just in terms of like the language,

09:57.880 --> 10:01.960
I think, I think there is a split between dynamical systems

10:01.960 --> 10:04.600
theory, which is kind of the origins of descriptions of

10:04.600 --> 10:07.280
automatic systems and information theory, but that that

10:07.280 --> 10:10.480
community has begun to embrace, you know, a little bit of

10:10.480 --> 10:15.000
information theory, but it tends to has been done through kind

10:15.000 --> 10:17.840
of phenomenological models, simple models, rather than kind

10:17.960 --> 10:22.560
of have this kind of theoretical angle or deep theoretical basis

10:22.560 --> 10:26.040
in something like Bayes that like we do, right? I mean, I to

10:26.040 --> 10:30.560
that paper, I read it before we come to me, it doesn't seem, you

10:30.560 --> 10:32.440
know, some of the language is quite dismissive. But to me, it

10:32.440 --> 10:36.080
seems an opportunity to see whether we can reconcile these

10:36.080 --> 10:38.480
frameworks. And I think they've done a nice job in pointing

10:38.480 --> 10:41.080
where there are maybe things we can express better within the

10:41.080 --> 10:43.080
free energy principle that kind of address things like

10:43.080 --> 10:46.600
operational closure. I feel that this community sometimes feels

10:46.640 --> 10:52.360
like it has to be divided. But I'm very much an inclusive

10:52.560 --> 10:57.760
person. So some really nice dialogue between people in an

10:57.760 --> 11:00.640
activism and what we do in the active inference and the free

11:00.640 --> 11:01.360
energy principle.

11:01.920 --> 11:05.040
Interesting. I mean, I'll bring Professor Friston in in just a

11:05.040 --> 11:07.480
second. But I was reading this very interesting paper by by

11:07.480 --> 11:12.400
Maxwell, written in, I think it's 2019, multi scale integration

11:12.440 --> 11:16.560
or internalism. And I was 21. Okay, so it's the multi scale

11:16.560 --> 11:20.400
integration paper. And you know, of course, this this an active

11:20.400 --> 11:22.840
philosophy is all about externalism. So you know, you

11:22.840 --> 11:27.240
actually have these cognizing elements outside of of where

11:27.240 --> 11:32.200
the brain is. And in a way, it's, there's this Helm-Hopsian

11:32.240 --> 11:35.160
sharp separation between the organism and the environment,

11:35.160 --> 11:38.320
which is perhaps embraced by neuroscientists. But the

11:38.320 --> 11:40.880
interesting thing about the free energy principle is, is I

11:40.880 --> 11:44.960
think it maintains some vagueness about this notion of

11:44.960 --> 11:48.320
whether it's an internalist system, where you have strong

11:48.320 --> 11:52.840
representations and predictive power about what's going on in

11:52.840 --> 11:57.760
the world around you, versus being this kind of dynamical

11:57.760 --> 12:00.920
externalist, inactive type system. And in that paper,

12:00.920 --> 12:03.560
Maxwell, you are saying that well, actually, we can integrate

12:03.560 --> 12:07.600
the two views because you can have these nested boundaries. And

12:07.600 --> 12:12.120
as Professor Friston has said, human minds, the reason we have

12:12.120 --> 12:15.000
this temporal depth of planning and sophistication and

12:15.000 --> 12:18.080
representation building and so on, is because we're at the top

12:18.080 --> 12:21.960
of the stack. But there's many, many layers below us where

12:22.080 --> 12:26.520
perhaps it is more of an inactive externalized form of

12:26.520 --> 12:29.800
cognition. So we can kind of speak to both worlds. But

12:29.880 --> 12:31.760
Professor Friston, perhaps you could come in on that.

12:35.760 --> 12:40.120
Yeah, I was frightened, you were going to ask me well, if I had

12:40.120 --> 12:43.920
anything to add about inactivism, because I haven't, I'm here

12:43.920 --> 12:47.040
to find out whether I'm an inactivist or not. So at the

12:47.040 --> 12:49.920
end, it's only come tell me whether I'm an inactivist, I'd

12:49.920 --> 12:52.600
be very grateful. There's probably some nuanced version of

12:52.600 --> 12:56.080
it, like a moderate, epistemological inactivist

12:56.080 --> 13:05.160
retrying. So I think, in that last point, Tim, I think is a

13:05.160 --> 13:07.720
really interesting one. And in fact, I just reviewed a paper

13:07.800 --> 13:10.720
synthese yesterday, I think, touching upon this issue from a

13:10.720 --> 13:16.040
philosophical perspective. But very simply, the free energy

13:16.040 --> 13:19.960
principle basically will accommodate both perspectives. It

13:19.960 --> 13:24.120
rests upon an externalist view of the universe as a random

13:24.120 --> 13:29.760
dynamical system, that just by equipping that system with a

13:29.760 --> 13:32.880
partition that separates something from everything else,

13:33.240 --> 13:38.520
then induces an internalist explanation for the way that

13:38.520 --> 13:43.520
thing makes sense of its universe. So there is a necessary

13:43.520 --> 13:46.480
enmeshing of both the externalist and the internalist

13:46.480 --> 13:50.800
perspectives. You put it another way, the internalist

13:50.800 --> 13:56.520
perspective is entirely licensed in terms of the

13:56.960 --> 14:00.920
interpretation of self organization as a process of

14:01.160 --> 14:06.160
inference. And you're with that an explicit commitment to a

14:06.160 --> 14:09.320
certain kind of representationalism. But that only

14:09.320 --> 14:12.240
inherits from the way you start from, which is an

14:12.240 --> 14:17.680
externalist view of the thing in an external world with with a

14:17.680 --> 14:20.640
particular metaphysics here described in terms of random

14:20.640 --> 14:23.600
dynamical systems. And it's interesting, also, you pick up

14:23.600 --> 14:28.480
on this fork in the road, which I confess, I completely, I do

14:28.520 --> 14:34.000
not understand. You know, all interesting information theory

14:34.040 --> 14:40.840
read as probability theory, that is used in physics inherits

14:40.840 --> 14:44.640
from dynamical systems. You know, we're talking thing

14:44.640 --> 14:48.200
ranging, things ranging from the master equation through

14:48.200 --> 14:51.520
to Schrodinger's wave equation, the Fokker-Planck

14:51.520 --> 14:55.680
equation, Comer of Ford equations, all of these are

14:55.680 --> 14:59.640
information theoretic treatments of dynamical systems. So I don't

14:59.640 --> 15:04.040
really understand the nature of this fork. So I probably should

15:04.040 --> 15:05.480
now pass you back to me.

15:05.520 --> 15:09.880
Well, can I follow up on that, Chris? And then maybe I don't

15:09.880 --> 15:13.600
get it either. And so what what confuses me about it is, one of

15:13.600 --> 15:17.280
the the brilliant things about the free energy principle, to me

15:17.280 --> 15:21.720
is this exact connection between random dynamical systems of a

15:21.720 --> 15:24.440
certain degree of complexity, let's say approaching

15:24.880 --> 15:28.600
auto poetic, right? And in this behavior that they must

15:28.600 --> 15:33.160
manifest in order to be what they are, right, which is which is

15:33.160 --> 15:36.080
this balancing between between, you know, uncertainty and

15:36.080 --> 15:39.440
prediction and that sort of thing. So to me, they're hand and

15:39.440 --> 15:42.240
glove. And so I guess my question to you, Chris, since you were

15:42.240 --> 15:45.000
going to jump in there is, what is the source of this conflict?

15:45.000 --> 15:47.840
Like, is it a fear that if it's linked, if you link the

15:48.080 --> 15:51.480
information and dynamics in this certain way that they have to

15:51.480 --> 15:54.080
conform to this principle that we're all going to be put out of

15:54.080 --> 15:56.280
work, or we're not going to be able to study the things we want

15:56.280 --> 15:59.240
to study or just do you mind if I just quickly interject with a

15:59.240 --> 16:03.480
little bit of context? Okay. Just to I wanted to elaborate a

16:03.480 --> 16:07.040
little bit on what Carl said, because I think there were some

16:07.040 --> 16:09.480
things in here that might move in what Carl said that might not

16:09.480 --> 16:15.320
be clear to the audience of the bears repeating. The first is

16:15.320 --> 16:19.600
that there's this idea that Markov blankets kind of seclude the

16:19.600 --> 16:23.240
organism from the environment. This is sort of like the

16:23.240 --> 16:28.360
Helmholtz style story where our relationship to the environment

16:28.360 --> 16:31.840
is in some sense only indirect and we are separated from the

16:31.880 --> 16:34.440
environment by our Markov blanket. The important thing to

16:34.440 --> 16:36.920
point out is that just definitionally, the Markov

16:36.920 --> 16:41.040
blanket comprises the set of degrees of freedom that separate

16:41.040 --> 16:46.640
and couple systems together. So it's not the veil, it's the

16:46.640 --> 16:52.280
interface. So that's the first thing to point out. So a radically

16:52.280 --> 16:55.400
internalist interpretation of the free energy principle doesn't

16:55.400 --> 16:58.680
work, because you actually need external states to be in play

16:58.680 --> 17:01.400
for the math tour. If there are no external states, then there's

17:01.400 --> 17:04.040
nothing to track. And there's nothing beyond the Markov

17:04.040 --> 17:07.080
blanket. So you don't get the story started, like it doesn't get

17:07.080 --> 17:09.960
off the ground. If you don't assume that there are these

17:09.960 --> 17:12.960
things that the particle in question that the thing that

17:12.960 --> 17:16.880
you're interested in is a tuning to and that so there needs to be

17:16.880 --> 17:19.960
something to couple and to be separated from for the story to

17:19.960 --> 17:24.520
get off the ground. So yeah, it's a if you write down your

17:24.520 --> 17:28.080
dynamical systems equations, it's always the generative model

17:28.080 --> 17:30.720
that we keep talking about is defined over your internal

17:30.760 --> 17:33.560
blanket and external states. So that's the first point. What

17:33.560 --> 17:36.440
Carlos is the other the other way around to which is if you're

17:36.440 --> 17:40.720
empty of all internal states, and every single state you have

17:40.720 --> 17:43.480
can be influenced from the outside. Well, there's less to

17:43.480 --> 17:46.440
talk about. Well, then you're not a thing, strictly speaking,

17:46.440 --> 17:51.960
right? That so you know, it's it's definitional to what it is to

17:51.960 --> 17:56.200
be a thing to have this kind of interface between that thing

17:56.200 --> 18:01.440
and other things. So that's a first point. So the internal

18:01.440 --> 18:03.360
states as your point as you're pointing out do play an

18:03.360 --> 18:06.200
asymmetric role. So the FEP says if you have this boundary,

18:06.200 --> 18:08.320
then the internal states are going to parameterize the

18:08.320 --> 18:11.520
belief about external states. So you do get this kind of

18:11.520 --> 18:15.640
internalist looking thing going as well. So the there is a I

18:15.640 --> 18:19.400
think a a kind of reconciliation of internalism and

18:19.400 --> 18:21.800
externalism under the free energy principle. This is what the

18:21.800 --> 18:25.600
2019 paper that you are referring to is about. It's

18:25.600 --> 18:28.680
called multiscale integration. And that's precisely the idea

18:28.680 --> 18:31.880
that things that look separated at one scale can be integrated

18:31.880 --> 18:35.000
within, you know, the auspices of an overarching structure at

18:35.000 --> 18:38.920
the scale above and so on and so on and so on. We're separate as

18:39.040 --> 18:41.640
individuals, but we're coupled in this active inference

18:41.640 --> 18:44.400
community. And, you know, arguably, there's an intentionality

18:44.440 --> 18:47.880
also at play there. Same thing for ourselves, right? Our

18:47.880 --> 18:50.240
cells are separate because they have their individual

18:50.240 --> 18:52.520
boundaries, but then they're integrated on the time scale

18:52.520 --> 18:57.320
of me as an organism and so on. So that's that was about

18:57.360 --> 19:00.120
internalism and externalism. I wanted to speak quickly to the

19:00.120 --> 19:04.040
split between dynamics and information theory. Whenever I

19:04.040 --> 19:06.640
talked to my friends in high end mathematics about this, they

19:06.640 --> 19:09.360
are always as perplexed as you know, Keith and Carl, you are

19:09.360 --> 19:13.920
because it's a nonsensical starting point. To do dynamical

19:13.920 --> 19:17.000
systems theory seriously, you at some point are going to need

19:17.000 --> 19:20.320
to appeal to information theoretic measures. So for

19:20.320 --> 19:23.480
example, distances in state space. So, you know, the

19:23.480 --> 19:25.880
inactivists are all thought, you know, they like to appeal to

19:25.880 --> 19:28.440
dynamical systems theory and stuff, but the systems that

19:28.440 --> 19:31.240
they're considering are usually extremely simple, with a few

19:31.240 --> 19:33.720
degrees of freedom that are coupled together. But if you

19:33.720 --> 19:38.640
want to do like, you know, grown up, dynamical systems theory,

19:38.800 --> 19:41.000
then you're going to need to appeal to things like information

19:41.000 --> 19:44.400
length to describe the really the metrics on your state space,

19:44.400 --> 19:47.880
you can't avoid that. Similarly, when we're talking about

19:47.880 --> 19:50.480
information, we're talking about dynamical, you know, the

19:50.480 --> 19:53.840
dynamic time course of the these coupling. So we're interested

19:53.840 --> 19:56.440
in the dynamics of information, these things are not actually

19:56.440 --> 20:01.080
separable. The idea that they are comes from philosophy,

20:01.080 --> 20:05.360
actually, it's a set of papers from the basically late 80s,

20:05.360 --> 20:11.280
early 90s by Van Gelder, and Port. And at the time, you know,

20:11.280 --> 20:14.160
dynamical systems theory was a new thing in cognitive science.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.680
And what they were saying was, Hey, there's this approach that

20:16.680 --> 20:19.800
we can take, it's dynamical systems, it's not computational.

20:19.960 --> 20:24.320
And basically, it moved from there to there's an there's this

20:24.320 --> 20:27.520
alternative approach that's mutually incompatible. And that

20:27.520 --> 20:31.160
shift kind of happened slowly by a self referential literature.

20:31.160 --> 20:34.040
So, you know, this is where I'm going to be a bit critical. You

20:34.040 --> 20:37.440
can really do the historiography and trace these claims back to

20:38.400 --> 20:41.080
I mean, basically Van Gelder and Port, and to some extent

20:41.080 --> 20:44.760
Gibson. But these folks, they don't offer a formal argument,

20:44.800 --> 20:47.080
right? Like, they're not saying here's a proof that dynamical

20:47.080 --> 20:49.480
systems and compute computational approaches are like

20:49.480 --> 20:53.320
incompatible. They're just starting with this gut feeling

20:53.320 --> 20:55.680
that hey, maybe there's something different here. And then

20:55.680 --> 20:59.960
that turns into I would argue, splurrata sizes or like hardens

21:00.000 --> 21:04.640
into like an a priori dogmatism, crystallizes that isn't

21:04.640 --> 21:09.160
necessary. Yeah, exactly. That is just based, like I was saying

21:09.160 --> 21:12.880
on this kind of circular, you know, we're just citing other

21:12.880 --> 21:16.520
philosophers who cite other philosophers who are making this

21:16.520 --> 21:21.160
stuff up at the bottom. So, yeah, I mean, I kind of feel like

21:21.160 --> 21:23.880
this is a problem with the philosophy literature is like,

21:24.200 --> 21:27.360
you know, taking just conceptual arguments from other

21:27.400 --> 21:30.680
philosophers, maybe a bit more seriously than they should,

21:30.840 --> 21:34.120
without really taking the time to do the proper historiography,

21:34.240 --> 21:36.800
looking where these claims are originating, and then asking

21:36.800 --> 21:39.440
the question, is there any real warrant for this kind of

21:39.440 --> 21:43.040
separation? So yeah, I've been going around recently saying

21:43.040 --> 21:46.200
that yeah, this split between dynamics and information theory

21:46.200 --> 21:48.720
is mostly in people's imaginations. There's no

21:48.720 --> 21:50.080
mathematical basis for it.

21:50.640 --> 21:54.320
And Chris, you wanted to jump in. No, no, thank you wanted to

21:54.320 --> 21:57.000
jump in earlier and maybe talk about your personal journey

21:57.040 --> 21:58.080
that might come into play here.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.960
Yeah, I mean, Maxwell's, you know, said some really

22:01.960 --> 22:04.760
interesting stuff there. I mean, I guess I take a slightly

22:04.760 --> 22:08.800
less hard line on that, right? I mean, I think it's a historical

22:08.800 --> 22:11.240
thing. So Tim Van Gelder, we're looking at deterministic

22:11.560 --> 22:13.680
dynamical systems theory, like this is in the absence of

22:13.680 --> 22:17.080
noise. And unless you do ensembles of systems, it's not

22:17.120 --> 22:20.720
there's no clear pathway then to information theory. And then

22:20.920 --> 22:25.920
initially in models, when in the 80s and 90s, typically, yeah,

22:25.920 --> 22:27.440
deterministic dynamical systems theory, looking at

22:27.440 --> 22:30.760
bifurcations and so on. And then, but obviously, the richer

22:30.840 --> 22:32.680
the richer set of descriptions is stochastic

22:32.680 --> 22:35.160
dynamical systems theory. And that's when information theory

22:35.160 --> 22:37.720
becomes irreplaceable, right? This become and then they've

22:37.720 --> 22:41.000
come fully in meshed these these descriptions as Carl writes

22:41.000 --> 22:44.760
about so nicely and lots of his work, right? But I think, you

22:44.760 --> 22:48.600
know, I didn't see the forking path as kind of this. I know

22:48.600 --> 22:50.920
in the community that there's a history of using dynamical

22:50.920 --> 22:53.280
systems theory, and there's a sense in which the free energy

22:53.280 --> 22:55.880
is really embraced information theory. I didn't see that

22:55.880 --> 23:00.800
that's as a as a key, the for the key in the fork of the path,

23:00.800 --> 23:06.080
right? I mean, I got to say that it's a way out of my area,

23:06.080 --> 23:09.280
this this kind of depth of philosophy, but it seemed to me

23:09.280 --> 23:11.480
the kind of the problem of operate the definition of

23:11.480 --> 23:17.760
operational closure that seemed to be upsetting to Randall

23:17.760 --> 23:22.120
Behr and is equal to power. And the fact that they don't think

23:22.120 --> 23:25.360
that can be embraced by the tenants of the free energy

23:25.360 --> 23:29.160
principle. I mean, I don't I think they they made a nice case,

23:29.160 --> 23:33.520
I don't think it a priori that's the case. I can't see there

23:33.520 --> 23:36.480
was a hands down argument that there is this forking path. I

23:36.480 --> 23:40.080
still think it's an interesting angle to take to think deeply

23:40.080 --> 23:44.080
about operational closure within the free energy principle is I

23:44.080 --> 23:47.120
know Maxwell has and he's going to tell you the answers to this,

23:47.120 --> 23:52.040
but you know, so I'm just aware of the trickiness in defining

23:52.040 --> 23:53.840
operational closure that's happened in the literature in the

23:53.840 --> 23:57.440
last 20 years. And then really, in an inability to kind of

23:57.440 --> 23:59.720
really get a concrete quantitative description of what we

23:59.720 --> 24:04.520
mean by operational closure. And so, you know, I guess it's to

24:04.520 --> 24:07.120
say that we've simply solved it within the free energy principle

24:07.120 --> 24:12.320
that might that might have put some backs up somewhere. But you

24:12.320 --> 24:15.160
know, Maxwell, maybe can give you a bit more insight to this

24:15.160 --> 24:18.520
because he's thought deeply about how to define a place

24:18.560 --> 24:21.960
closure within the frame. Can I can I can I frame up for you,

24:21.960 --> 24:27.040
Maxwell? So the paper quoted you actually, I think you you said

24:27.040 --> 24:31.440
on one of your papers that there is an analogy, almost a direct

24:31.440 --> 24:35.280
mapping between this concept of organizational closure and a

24:35.280 --> 24:37.840
Markov blanket. And of course, the Markov blanket is this

24:38.040 --> 24:40.280
conditional independence that you're talking about. And you

24:40.280 --> 24:44.480
also called it an interface earlier on. And when they speak

24:44.480 --> 24:48.160
about the definition of auto polices, they say that, I think

24:48.160 --> 24:51.920
the way that you folks in the FEP literature culture is mostly

24:52.120 --> 24:55.640
as a form of autonomy, which is this ability to maintain your

24:55.640 --> 25:00.400
own identity under precarious position, you know, situations.

25:00.680 --> 25:05.280
And they say, well, the Varela kind of definition of auto

25:05.280 --> 25:10.240
polices is very much about structure and organization. So

25:10.240 --> 25:12.520
it's not it's not just maintaining your own identity,

25:12.520 --> 25:16.160
but it's about this self organization and this kind of

25:16.160 --> 25:19.400
generating structure as well. So I wonder just just with those

25:19.400 --> 25:22.280
things on the table, could you, could you

25:22.920 --> 25:26.840
absolutely. So in that paper, I confess that I probably should

25:26.840 --> 25:29.000
have spoken, we probably should have spoken a bit more

25:29.000 --> 25:33.120
precisely. We say the Markov blanket formalism. What we mean

25:33.120 --> 25:36.080
by that is, and I don't think that this was fully appreciated by

25:36.080 --> 25:41.240
the authors at the time. What we mean is Markov blankets and the

25:41.240 --> 25:46.560
generative models, right? Because the claim is, right, let's

25:46.560 --> 25:50.400
remind the audience, just put the terms on the table. A

25:50.400 --> 25:55.840
generative model, right, is our model of the dependencies that

25:55.840 --> 26:00.720
link the states and parameters that make up a given system,

26:00.760 --> 26:04.240
right? So it is our way of talking about basically the

26:04.240 --> 26:07.920
causal, connective tissue or structure that underwrites a

26:07.920 --> 26:11.040
given system. And what the free energy principle says is, if

26:11.040 --> 26:14.600
the underlying system has is disconnected in a certain

26:14.640 --> 26:19.400
appropriate way, then you get this tracking behavior. And

26:19.400 --> 26:22.800
formally speaking, it says, if there's a Markov blanket in

26:22.800 --> 26:27.160
this dependency structure, right, if conditioned on certain

26:27.160 --> 26:30.120
blanket states, then it looks as if subsets of the system are

26:30.120 --> 26:33.160
independent from each other, but also tracking each other,

26:33.160 --> 26:36.960
then you know, you get you get this interesting behavior, like

26:36.960 --> 26:40.240
the if there is this Markov blanket is if there is this

26:40.320 --> 26:42.600
independent structure, then you will get this tracking

26:42.600 --> 26:44.480
behavior. That's what the free energy principle is talking

26:44.480 --> 26:49.360
about. So of course, it's not sufficient to say that things

26:49.440 --> 26:53.240
are carved out in a specific way. And therefore, you know, you

26:53.240 --> 26:56.120
can say interesting things about them. But I think what's

26:56.160 --> 27:00.160
missed in the argument, and this has to do with like, you know,

27:00.160 --> 27:05.520
I think the app, the, the, the, I'll say, provocatively, the

27:05.560 --> 27:09.440
dogmatic commitment to anti-representationalism is like

27:09.480 --> 27:12.480
what when the inactivists read generative model, they mean a

27:12.480 --> 27:15.560
model in my head that I carry around, they hear like a

27:15.560 --> 27:20.240
representation, right? But what's really at stake is the

27:20.240 --> 27:24.160
generative model is the dependency structure. Right? So if

27:24.160 --> 27:27.160
you have the right kind of dependency structure that

27:27.160 --> 27:30.560
generates a Markov blanket, I would say that you have what the

27:30.560 --> 27:34.360
inactivists call operational closure. In fact, you can show

27:34.360 --> 27:37.120
this mathematically, it's I don't think it's appreciated, but

27:37.800 --> 27:42.320
there is a duality that has been rigorously established. Dalton

27:42.320 --> 27:46.360
Shakti Maribel is probably the main proponent of this work,

27:46.360 --> 27:48.760
but you know, Carl has done a lot of work over the last two

27:48.760 --> 27:53.720
decades in this direction. Yeah, I think the the kind of core

27:53.720 --> 27:59.200
idea to remember is that minimizing your variational

27:59.200 --> 28:03.080
entropy with your variational free energy with respect to a

28:03.080 --> 28:06.480
generative model, right? So the usual free energy story, right,

28:06.640 --> 28:11.080
is dual to or equivalent to maximizing your entropy with

28:11.080 --> 28:15.960
respect to a set of constraints. So when the inactivists talk

28:15.960 --> 28:19.440
about constraint closure and all this stuff, you know, Alicia

28:19.440 --> 28:23.240
Gerero's new book, context changes, everything, the

28:23.240 --> 28:27.320
inactivists in the auto poetic tradition really want to go

28:27.320 --> 28:29.720
hard on this and say, Well, what you really need to do is map a

28:29.720 --> 28:32.640
set of constraints, such that the system kind of self

28:32.680 --> 28:36.480
generates. Well, that is rigorously, and absolutely

28:36.520 --> 28:40.120
equivalent to minimizing your free energy with respect to a

28:40.120 --> 28:43.200
generative model, there's no difference there. So we're talking

28:43.200 --> 28:45.720
about the same thing, we're talking about the way that like a

28:45.720 --> 28:49.840
set of structured dependencies generates a thing that's able to

28:49.840 --> 28:53.960
sustain itself over time. And as I was saying, this sustained

28:53.960 --> 28:56.200
over time is a way of describing the interface or

28:56.200 --> 29:00.160
coupling between the system and its environment. So that just

29:00.200 --> 29:02.880
mathematically, we're talking about the same thing.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.200
But let me ask you a question here, because there's, and this

29:07.200 --> 29:10.160
is hopefully because I like Carl, I want to find out if I'm an

29:10.160 --> 29:13.280
inactivist. So maybe, maybe you can help set us up for

29:13.280 --> 29:15.960
considering this, a big bone of contention for them in that

29:15.960 --> 29:19.360
paper, is this distinction that they have in their mind between

29:19.600 --> 29:24.000
structure and organization. And they seem to get upset when any

29:24.000 --> 29:27.920
attempt is made to link organization to structure. For

29:27.920 --> 29:32.400
example, you know, to me, the Markov boundary that say

29:32.400 --> 29:37.480
analogous to a, a animal cell membrane, I understand as a

29:37.480 --> 29:41.320
former person who studied biology, that the molecules of

29:41.320 --> 29:44.560
that membrane are in flux, things come and go, proteins

29:44.560 --> 29:47.720
are added, carbohydrates are removed, etc. I don't have in

29:47.720 --> 29:51.280
my mind a set of molecules that's like they're forever, and

29:51.280 --> 29:54.960
some type of like, you know, stationary structure, like it's

29:54.960 --> 29:58.400
a very dynamic kind of system. But they seem to say, Oh, no,

29:58.400 --> 30:01.800
if you if you equate, you know, a Markov boundary to an

30:01.800 --> 30:04.400
organizational structure, then you're making this, you know,

30:04.600 --> 30:08.080
fallacy of kind where you're associating like an organization

30:08.320 --> 30:11.080
with like the substrate that, you know, manifests that in

30:11.080 --> 30:13.720
reality. Like, can you explain to me like what they were

30:13.720 --> 30:17.320
actually up and about with this organization structure? You

30:17.320 --> 30:19.640
know, maybe Carl, if you could comment on it, when Maxwell

30:19.640 --> 30:24.280
tells us so we can figure out if we're an activist. So I'll just

30:24.280 --> 30:27.160
let me bracket the stuff about stationarity and historicity

30:27.160 --> 30:32.400
for one second. Because I have some stuff to say about that. But

30:32.440 --> 30:36.200
so it comes back to that we'll come back to that question about

30:36.200 --> 30:39.120
that. It comes back to what I was saying about, you know, it's

30:39.120 --> 30:42.160
not just about Markov blankets, it's about generative models. If

30:42.160 --> 30:45.320
you don't appreciate the distinction. And what you think

30:45.480 --> 30:48.720
we're saying is Markov blankets tell the whole story, then

30:48.720 --> 30:51.160
obviously, you're going to, you know, think that we're

30:51.160 --> 30:54.400
conflating structure and organization. When you realize

30:54.400 --> 30:57.520
that what we're talking about is, you know, a Markov blanket

30:57.520 --> 31:02.080
within this dependency structure, right, that then I think you

31:02.120 --> 31:04.400
you move to something else, I would say like what the

31:04.400 --> 31:07.200
inactivist called structure corresponds to these Markov

31:07.200 --> 31:10.600
blankets that we're drawing. And the organization we talk

31:10.600 --> 31:13.440
about, and we harness in the generative model, right, that

31:13.440 --> 31:15.720
remember, the generative model is not my internal

31:15.720 --> 31:18.440
representation in my head, it's the overall dependency

31:18.440 --> 31:20.880
structure of the system. It's what they would call the

31:20.880 --> 31:24.400
organization of the system. So I mean, I would agree that we

31:24.400 --> 31:27.840
shouldn't conflate them. And I would, you know, add that we

31:27.840 --> 31:31.840
don't, there are distinct constructs that map onto these

31:31.840 --> 31:35.400
things. And, you know, I would also point out that Markov

31:35.400 --> 31:41.560
blankets are flexible. We will be putting out work over the

31:41.560 --> 31:45.280
next few months on wandering Markov blankets, like we've got

31:45.400 --> 31:49.120
figured out algorithmically now, we can draw a blanket around a

31:49.120 --> 31:51.760
flame and stuff like that. Now, so we've got all of that

31:51.760 --> 31:53.480
working. And it's not

31:53.480 --> 31:55.920
I've been looking forward to that since Carl mentioned it in

31:55.920 --> 31:59.560
the first, the first interview with him, let's, let's set an

31:59.560 --> 32:01.160
anchor to come back to that because that that's very

32:01.160 --> 32:03.720
interesting. Actually, one comment you made in your

32:03.720 --> 32:07.280
multi scale paper was that these are ontological boundaries by

32:07.280 --> 32:10.520
which I think you are implying that they are not a lens, they

32:10.520 --> 32:13.760
are fixed to some extent. But I want to just stick on this

32:14.200 --> 32:16.720
organization point for a second, though. So in the paper,

32:16.720 --> 32:22.440
they said that essentially the way the FEP couches this is as a

32:22.440 --> 32:26.520
form of homeostasis, which is just about, you know, maintaining

32:26.520 --> 32:29.360
structural properties. And when they spoke about organization,

32:29.360 --> 32:32.840
they said the conservation of organization is what's spoken

32:32.840 --> 32:36.040
about in the classic orthopedic literature. And I think you are

32:36.040 --> 32:38.640
just making the argument Maxwell that that that generative

32:38.640 --> 32:42.840
model is in some sense the conservation of organization. So

32:42.840 --> 32:45.600
is that the missing link? I mean, maybe a professor for us and

32:45.600 --> 32:46.280
you can come in.

32:48.520 --> 32:50.400
Yeah, do you want to take that Carl? I mean, I think that's

32:50.400 --> 32:53.920
right. But Carl will probably comment more eloquently than I

32:53.920 --> 32:54.440
on that.

32:54.880 --> 32:57.120
I don't think so. I think you're being very eloquent.

32:57.720 --> 32:58.080
Thank you.

32:58.680 --> 33:02.680
Do your worst and then I'll chip in if necessary.

33:08.520 --> 33:11.440
Yeah, I mean, I think that's that's exactly right. Like the

33:12.200 --> 33:16.840
Markov blankets don't have to be permanent. They can be

33:16.840 --> 33:20.720
shifting and basically minimizing your free energy with

33:20.720 --> 33:23.880
respect to some generative model corresponds to keeping some

33:23.880 --> 33:25.240
structure in play.

33:26.720 --> 33:30.080
Yep. Actually, this segue is nicely into the stuff about

33:30.080 --> 33:33.640
stationarity and historicity. I think this is the biggest

33:33.640 --> 33:37.240
problem in their paper. They claim that the free energy

33:37.240 --> 33:40.960
principle can't account for historicity, in the sense that

33:40.960 --> 33:45.160
it can't account for path dependency, right? So for our

33:45.160 --> 33:48.520
audience, path dependency is this idea that it's not just your

33:48.520 --> 33:52.000
position in state space that matters. It's also your velocity,

33:52.040 --> 33:55.480
roughly speaking, right? That like the kind of direction that

33:55.480 --> 33:59.640
you're going in, where you came from is just as important to

33:59.640 --> 34:03.680
where you're going is where you are currently. And they claim

34:03.680 --> 34:06.240
that, you know, the free energy, so they make a bunch of false

34:06.240 --> 34:08.560
claims about the free energy principle, which leads them

34:08.560 --> 34:10.640
astray. So for example, they claim that the free energy

34:10.640 --> 34:15.400
principle assumes stationarity. It doesn't. As we've discussed

34:15.400 --> 34:17.600
before, there are different applications of the free energy

34:17.600 --> 34:20.080
principle in the literature. The two main families of

34:20.080 --> 34:26.360
applications are density dynamics and path intervals. So I

34:26.360 --> 34:29.840
drink a lot of coffee. And if you were to sample me at random

34:29.840 --> 34:33.240
during the day, I would say there's a one in 25 chance. Yeah,

34:33.240 --> 34:36.560
exactly. I would say there's a one in 25 chance that I'm

34:36.560 --> 34:39.120
drinking coffee if you just sample me randomly during the

34:39.120 --> 34:44.040
day. If you were to sample me over a week, once per day,

34:44.040 --> 34:48.280
there's a 100% chance that I would drink coffee per day, right?

34:48.280 --> 34:50.760
So there's a difference between looking at the probability of

34:50.760 --> 34:54.320
states of me, you know, Maxwell is drinking coffee, and the

34:54.320 --> 34:59.480
probabilities of paths of me or entire trajectories of me. And

34:59.520 --> 35:03.520
that is a really critical distinction. The free energy

35:03.680 --> 35:07.080
principle started off as a path based formulation. And I think

35:07.080 --> 35:09.800
this is absolutely underappreciated in the literature.

35:09.800 --> 35:13.000
If you look back at Carl's early papers, including the ones

35:13.000 --> 35:17.560
that everyone has read, right? The 2010 unified brain theory

35:17.560 --> 35:21.760
paper in nature. Yet these are all written in terms of paths.

35:21.800 --> 35:25.240
Carl is taking like a sensory path and then writing down, you

35:25.240 --> 35:29.600
know, blanket paths and internal paths. And it's all, it's all

35:29.600 --> 35:33.480
about the way the trajectories of the system are maintained. So

35:33.480 --> 35:36.360
this is a cool idea that was there before and that we're

35:36.360 --> 35:39.720
doubling back down on now, which is that it's really, it's

35:39.720 --> 35:43.800
about blanket paths that make internal paths independent of

35:43.840 --> 35:47.760
external paths. So there's a sense in which like, it's always

35:47.760 --> 35:51.920
been about counterfactual futures. It's, and it's difficult to

35:51.920 --> 35:54.840
argue that, like, you don't account for historicity when

35:54.840 --> 35:58.760
literally the core construct that you're deploying is, like

35:58.760 --> 36:02.000
probabilities of different histories, like counterfactual

36:02.000 --> 36:06.600
futures. But that entire argument about historicity makes no

36:06.600 --> 36:10.920
sense formally, just abs, you know, and again, we appreciate

36:10.920 --> 36:14.240
the critical engagement. This isn't to, you know, bash anyone

36:14.240 --> 36:17.480
specifically. But like, this is a complete non starter

36:17.480 --> 36:21.720
mathematically. Also, when you're doing density dynamics,

36:21.720 --> 36:24.320
right, when you're not considering probability densities

36:24.320 --> 36:27.680
over paths, but rather you're considering probabilities of

36:27.680 --> 36:30.640
states, and you're doing this non equilibrium steady state

36:30.640 --> 36:34.120
stuff. So when you are assuming stationarity, you're saying

36:34.120 --> 36:36.080
like, yeah, there are these kind of regular cyclical

36:36.080 --> 36:39.880
behaviors that I want to model, even in that context, the

36:39.880 --> 36:42.120
free energy principle can handle path dependence, like

36:42.120 --> 36:45.360
literally, I think on page 12 of like Carl's monograph from

36:45.360 --> 36:49.360
2019, on the density dynamics formulations, there are already

36:49.360 --> 36:52.280
terms that contain, you know, expressions that are able to

36:52.280 --> 36:55.400
handle path dependency, that are basically dependent on

36:55.400 --> 36:58.240
changes in surprise in your system. So, so

36:58.480 --> 37:01.760
before we, before we move too far, maybe Chris, you can, you

37:01.760 --> 37:05.120
might be able to steel man what the, the paper was trying to

37:05.120 --> 37:06.640
say there, or

37:09.360 --> 37:11.320
well, I'm just, I'm just, I'm trying to understand, I'm trying

37:11.320 --> 37:14.240
to decide if I'm an inactivist, because Tim's a big fan. So I

37:14.240 --> 37:17.480
want to, you know, give it fair judge anyone, does anybody

37:17.480 --> 37:20.960
want to steel man, you know, where the paper might have been

37:20.960 --> 37:24.120
coming from, in terms of this argument against

37:24.600 --> 37:25.400
historicity?

37:28.360 --> 37:29.760
I can straw man it if you want it.

37:30.200 --> 37:36.520
No, I'm happy to have a go at it. But I mean, so we're a very

37:36.520 --> 37:41.440
broad church at within this community, we we debate within

37:41.440 --> 37:44.760
ourselves about the, you know, the true origins and how we get

37:44.760 --> 37:48.000
these things out. So I actually was worried about this

37:48.000 --> 37:53.040
historicity thing. In an earlier version, we did in, we

37:53.040 --> 37:55.640
published in physics life reviews with a student, a very

37:55.640 --> 37:58.640
talented student of mine. And we found real problems with it

37:58.640 --> 38:01.800
when we were in a state based formulation of the system. And

38:01.800 --> 38:05.880
I know Maxwell feels that that even in the state based

38:05.880 --> 38:08.280
description of probability densities that we can recover

38:08.280 --> 38:13.880
historicity, I guess we still not complete agreement on that.

38:14.120 --> 38:17.320
But what's majorly happened in the in the free energy is this

38:17.320 --> 38:21.280
movement to pass. And I agree with Maxwell, if you go back into

38:21.400 --> 38:25.120
Carl's original work, talking like Carl was not here, but you're

38:25.120 --> 38:28.800
back to Carl's original work, he was framing in terms of paths.

38:28.960 --> 38:32.080
But the presentations in the monograph were to do to do with

38:32.080 --> 38:35.640
states. And when we work through that, we found that the

38:35.640 --> 38:39.720
historicity was hard to to to get back into these systems. But

38:39.720 --> 38:43.040
the path formalization then makes it clear how historicity

38:43.040 --> 38:45.560
because it's built into the system because you're preserving

38:45.720 --> 38:48.360
sets of paths you go to, you know, homeoresis rather than

38:48.720 --> 38:51.720
homeostasis in the descriptions of these systems. And then

38:51.720 --> 38:54.400
there's this kind of nice, elegant way to deal with

38:54.440 --> 38:57.760
historicity. And, you know, and I think so, I don't think

38:57.760 --> 39:01.280
that's a real issue with the free energy principle. So, but I

39:01.280 --> 39:05.080
can imagine, I don't know what technical literature they've

39:05.080 --> 39:07.360
read. But perhaps if they've read the state based formula,

39:07.600 --> 39:10.000
formulation, they had the same worries about those about

39:10.000 --> 39:13.520
historicity. And if they read these new path based stuff that

39:14.520 --> 39:16.640
Maxwell and Dalton are developing, I think those kind

39:16.640 --> 39:20.480
of dissolve. I think that it's a much richer framework now.

39:21.120 --> 39:24.760
So maybe Carl, what were you thinking back then when you did

39:24.760 --> 39:29.240
it as as paths, you know, maybe just give us some some thought

39:29.240 --> 39:32.760
behind your intuition for why you originally formulated it as

39:32.760 --> 39:36.040
you know, path, path integrals for past systems and you know,

39:36.360 --> 39:39.120
what your perspective is on what we've been discussing so far.

39:39.840 --> 39:45.200
Right. I can't really remember. I suppose the obvious answer is

39:45.320 --> 39:48.200
much of this inherits from Richard Feynman's work on the

39:48.200 --> 39:50.280
path integral formulation. Indeed, the variational free

39:50.280 --> 39:55.320
energy can be traced right back to I think probably is PhD

39:55.320 --> 39:57.680
thesis. I haven't actually read the PhD thesis, but I've been

39:57.680 --> 40:02.480
told that all the maths you need is there. So it would be

40:02.480 --> 40:07.120
difficult for me to conceive of a calculus that wasn't framed in

40:07.120 --> 40:12.480
terms of in terms of paths, until you start to try and draw

40:12.480 --> 40:16.960
graphics and explain to people who are not familiar with, you

40:17.000 --> 40:18.960
know, with the notion of, you know, with the path integral

40:18.960 --> 40:23.040
formulation and its equivalence with density dynamics as

40:23.040 --> 40:26.240
articulated say with the Vokker-Planck equation or I repeat

40:26.240 --> 40:33.080
sort of Kolmogorov forward and backward equations. So I think

40:33.080 --> 40:39.200
that is, you know, that's one really important aspect of

40:39.200 --> 40:44.320
historicity and becomes I think even more prescient when you

40:44.320 --> 40:48.720
think about deploying a path integral formulation of self

40:48.720 --> 40:52.600
organisation in the context of 21st century physics, because

40:52.600 --> 40:56.240
what we're talking about now is a move away from 20th century

40:56.240 --> 41:01.920
equilibrium physics with pointer tractors to open systems that

41:01.920 --> 41:05.960
are far from equilibrium. So mathematically, or one

41:06.000 --> 41:11.000
mathematical bright line between the physics of equilibria and

41:11.000 --> 41:13.200
the physics of non equilibria, which is what the free energy

41:13.240 --> 41:20.040
principle is about, or specifically, when non equilibrium

41:20.760 --> 41:24.800
city-state solutions admit a Markov blanket, but returning to

41:24.800 --> 41:29.880
the sort of what is definitive of non equilibria, it is

41:29.880 --> 41:37.080
effectively the, not the historicity, but the itinerancy

41:37.080 --> 41:41.640
you get from solenoidal dynamics, sort of conservative

41:41.640 --> 41:46.920
dynamics that now supplement the dissipative flows that

41:46.920 --> 41:50.520
characterize completely classical physics and equilibrium

41:51.360 --> 41:55.080
equilibria steady states. So if you wanted to define the

41:55.080 --> 41:59.600
difference between an open system or an out of equilibrium or

41:59.600 --> 42:03.360
non equilibrium system from an equilibrium system, the simple

42:03.360 --> 42:08.920
kind of systems that Chris was referring to in his toy models

42:08.960 --> 42:11.560
of your does a free energy principle work in your in this

42:11.560 --> 42:17.200
kind of system, then all you would do is write down the

42:17.200 --> 42:22.160
dynamics in terms of dissipative and conservative or

42:22.160 --> 42:28.080
non-dissipative divergence free components. And that, if you

42:28.080 --> 42:32.440
like, decomposition of the flow into conservative and

42:32.440 --> 42:36.520
dissipative parts is just the Helmholtz decomposition is just

42:36.520 --> 42:39.880
the fundamental number of variational calculus, I think,

42:40.640 --> 42:44.760
or fundamental theorem, which just says that, you know, any

42:44.760 --> 42:50.400
flow, any dynamics can always be decomposed into this sort of

42:50.400 --> 42:54.200
gradient descent that underwrites classical physics or

42:54.240 --> 43:00.640
equilibrium physics, and the a solenoidal divergence free flow

43:00.640 --> 43:04.280
that underwrites classical mechanics. But you put the two

43:04.320 --> 43:10.960
together and you have, by definition, now a mathematical

43:10.960 --> 43:15.400
image of non equilibrium systems. And notice that in

43:15.400 --> 43:21.160
introducing this kind of itinerancy, that is, for

43:21.160 --> 43:25.280
example, you know, heuristically, you know, water going

43:25.280 --> 43:28.040
down a plug hole. So the dissipative part, the gradient

43:28.040 --> 43:32.040
flow would be the the water tumbling down into the depths

43:32.080 --> 43:36.800
of your house. But as it circulates around, technically,

43:36.800 --> 43:40.720
in terms of the information theory around on ISO contours,

43:40.720 --> 43:42.920
the probability distribution, but you know, you can just

43:42.920 --> 43:46.840
visualize the water circular, that's the solenoidal part. And

43:46.840 --> 43:50.880
of course, when you talk about biotic self organization or

43:50.880 --> 43:56.240
self organization, non equilibria, that has that sort of

43:56.240 --> 44:02.360
life like our biotic form, the key characteristic of this

44:02.360 --> 44:05.760
kind of biotic circulation is basically rhythms and life

44:05.760 --> 44:12.400
cycles. So the very fact you're dealing with this kind of

44:12.680 --> 44:18.600
historicity that is inherent in the itinerancy of any system

44:18.640 --> 44:22.880
that is not at equilibrium means that you are you have to

44:23.000 --> 44:27.400
write down or have an understanding or a mathematics

44:27.400 --> 44:30.640
that deals with these with these flows and these life cycles.

44:31.240 --> 44:35.240
Just one interesting twist here is if you take the randomness

44:35.240 --> 44:37.880
out of it, if you go back to deterministic dynamical

44:37.880 --> 44:42.320
systems of the kind, I now understand under the split or

44:42.320 --> 44:46.120
the fork in the road in philosophy. What you do is

44:46.120 --> 44:48.040
you're basically removing from the perspective of the

44:48.040 --> 44:51.200
Helmholtz decomposition, the dissipative part, and you just

44:51.240 --> 44:54.440
left with the conservative part. What is that? That's just

44:54.800 --> 44:57.720
Newtonian mechanics. It's his classical mechanics, which is

44:57.720 --> 45:02.280
why the sun, we rotate around the sun or the moon takes these

45:02.280 --> 45:07.040
orbits. This is just this solenoidal flow in the limit that

45:07.040 --> 45:11.640
you've ignored the randomness that you need that calls for the

45:11.640 --> 45:15.280
information theoretic or probabilistic descriptions of any

45:15.280 --> 45:18.560
world. So that the free energy principle doesn't deal with all

45:18.560 --> 45:23.200
kinds of systems. It deals with systems that have an admixture

45:23.200 --> 45:26.880
of both the dissipative and the solenoidal or divergence free

45:26.880 --> 45:29.920
parts. If you wanted to just do the dissipative parts, you do

45:29.920 --> 45:33.120
quantum mechanics. If you just wanted to do the solenoidal

45:33.120 --> 45:35.840
part, you do classical mechanics and deterministic

45:35.840 --> 45:40.640
systems. But in the middle, you're in the Goldilocks regime

45:40.640 --> 45:43.840
in which you and I operate, we're talking about stochastic

45:43.880 --> 45:47.680
chaos, basically, another description of this itinerancy.

45:47.920 --> 45:51.080
So I think that that's that's, you know, one aspect of

45:51.080 --> 45:56.640
historicity, which, you know, is celebrated in the physics of

45:56.640 --> 46:00.880
self organization. And I keep using the word self organization

46:00.880 --> 46:05.240
because I read auto poesis as self creation, or at least self

46:05.240 --> 46:10.280
maintenance. I now appreciate it is not quite self. It's slightly

46:10.280 --> 46:15.680
beyond self maintenance and in the sense that, you know, to

46:15.680 --> 46:22.040
create your imply something slightly greater that maybe I'm

46:22.040 --> 46:24.920
going to have to ask Chris, it may be related to operational

46:24.920 --> 46:29.160
closure. So I'd like to if somebody just describe for me and

46:29.160 --> 46:31.960
the audience when operational closure is that would be quite

46:31.960 --> 46:36.400
nice. But before you do, there is another important aspect of

46:36.400 --> 46:40.640
historicity, which we haven't mentioned, which inherits from

46:41.400 --> 46:45.120
the deployment of the free energy principle, or perhaps

46:45.160 --> 46:49.560
just the Helmholtz decomposition in using the apparatus of the

46:49.560 --> 46:52.680
renormalization group. And what that brings to the table is a

46:52.680 --> 46:56.080
separation of temporal scales. And as soon as you have that in

46:56.080 --> 46:59.840
play, there's a different kind of historicity, which you have to

46:59.840 --> 47:03.000
accommodate in any given calculus, certainly for open

47:03.000 --> 47:08.120
systems, which means that the kind of steady state solutions

47:08.160 --> 47:10.920
that are non equilibrium set solutions, we are talking about

47:11.560 --> 47:16.040
in the context of a pathological formulation only exist over a

47:16.040 --> 47:19.680
certain timescale. There's always a timescale above that

47:19.680 --> 47:22.840
contextualizes it. And there's always a timescale below that is

47:22.840 --> 47:26.760
much, much faster, where things live for very, very short

47:26.760 --> 47:29.720
periods of time. I think that's another important aspect of

47:29.720 --> 47:32.680
historicity that we're not talking about a unique or

47:32.680 --> 47:35.560
privileged timescale here. So when people talk about

47:35.600 --> 47:43.280
stationarity, or ergodicity, or steady states, they, you know,

47:43.280 --> 47:48.200
one cannot say that this is the configuration of a system at

47:48.200 --> 47:53.360
equals infinity. Because you have to acknowledge that there is no

47:53.360 --> 47:56.960
privileged timescales at this timescale, we will assume that

47:56.960 --> 48:00.920
is a state solution. But we have to be very explicit is at this

48:00.920 --> 48:04.440
timescale. And this does not apply at the timescale above, or

48:04.520 --> 48:07.880
at all the timescale below. And interestingly, just

48:07.880 --> 48:11.800
mathematically, perhaps a naive mathematical or certainly a

48:11.800 --> 48:14.960
physicist's mathematical perspective, and the very fact

48:14.960 --> 48:18.400
you have the separation of timescale basically means that

48:18.400 --> 48:22.360
there are fast, there's fast stuff for fast dynamics and slow

48:22.360 --> 48:28.200
dynamics. And at the end of the day, if you now consider what is

48:28.200 --> 48:32.000
the difference between the flow of states that you would find in

48:32.040 --> 48:37.160
deterministic, deterministic dynamical system, and the random

48:37.160 --> 48:41.240
fluctuations that convert it into a random dynamical system, the

48:41.240 --> 48:44.040
only difference between these things is whether they're fast or

48:44.040 --> 48:47.880
slow. So you can treat the random fluctuations, the noise that

48:47.880 --> 48:51.080
induces a probabilistic description, and all the

48:51.080 --> 48:56.680
information theoretic treatments, as simply the fast things, and

48:56.680 --> 49:01.480
everything else is the slow stuff. So again, speaking to, if

49:01.480 --> 49:07.880
you like, an almost necessary connection between any dynamical

49:07.880 --> 49:12.160
systems formulation that is sufficiently liberal to include

49:12.160 --> 49:15.960
fast and slow stuff, and probabilistic treatments of that

49:16.000 --> 49:20.520
of the kind that Richard Feynman pursued in terms of trying to

49:20.520 --> 49:22.920
work out the probability of the path of the small particle or

49:22.920 --> 49:27.200
electron for his PhD thesis. Anyway, what is operational

49:27.200 --> 49:27.840
closure?

49:28.040 --> 49:33.520
So just go up a definition from Varela, if you want me to read

49:33.520 --> 49:33.880
it out.

49:34.320 --> 49:37.440
Can I just frame you up there, Chris? Because in that forking

49:37.440 --> 49:40.520
paper, there was I actually thought it was a little bit

49:41.040 --> 49:44.560
hand wavy. It's not like in graph theory, where you have very

49:44.560 --> 49:48.840
kind of precise definition. So they had a they had a kind of a

49:48.840 --> 49:52.520
node diagram. And they said it was operationally closed if all

49:52.520 --> 49:55.440
of the black colored nodes had one arrow going out and

49:55.440 --> 49:58.080
connecting to another one. And they had a kind of diagram

49:58.080 --> 50:02.040
just showing an organism. But what's the official definition,

50:02.040 --> 50:02.320
Chris?

50:03.120 --> 50:06.160
Yeah, so this is a definition from Varela, as an autonomous

50:06.160 --> 50:09.480
system is that is that organization is characterized by

50:09.480 --> 50:12.960
processes such that the processes are related as a network, so

50:12.960 --> 50:15.480
that recursively depend on each other in the generation

50:15.480 --> 50:18.960
realization of the processes themselves. And two, they

50:18.960 --> 50:23.120
constitute the system as a unity, recognizable in space, in

50:23.120 --> 50:25.400
which those processes exist. So it's kind of this deep

50:25.400 --> 50:29.720
recursive recursivity between the processes, maintaining the

50:29.720 --> 50:32.280
network is necessary for the processes, this kind of

50:32.280 --> 50:35.960
generation of the system's own constraints. I guess this has

50:35.960 --> 50:39.080
been it's always been the kind of slightly ineffable within the

50:39.080 --> 50:41.720
auto put it literature, what this means formally, right?

50:41.720 --> 50:43.680
There's a deep intuition. This is correct. You know, you think

50:43.680 --> 50:48.720
about, as Keith said before, we the matter is changing as as

50:48.720 --> 50:51.600
fluxes changing these processes, but the identity is

50:51.720 --> 50:54.480
somehow staying the same. And that's the organizational

50:54.480 --> 50:56.880
structure that's maintained over time, rather than the

50:56.880 --> 51:01.280
material components of that, that structure. And I do think

51:01.280 --> 51:05.400
you know, that there is a sense that was when we did focus on

51:05.400 --> 51:08.520
these state based descriptions of the free energy principle, I

51:08.520 --> 51:13.280
think that kind of undersold the solenoidal flow that Carl was

51:13.280 --> 51:16.040
talking about, whereas that is, I think it's much more

51:16.040 --> 51:19.400
important to the people in in auto poise is because this notion

51:19.760 --> 51:22.680
of this kind of flow of information and the organization

51:22.680 --> 51:26.160
is dynamic within the equilibrium is important for for that

51:26.160 --> 51:28.720
field. So I think the you know, the new directions they've got

51:28.760 --> 51:30.960
in the free energy principle things that Maxwell and Dalton

51:30.960 --> 51:35.040
are pursuing is to me an exciting opportunity to kind of

51:35.040 --> 51:37.920
reconcile some of the ineffability of these operational

51:37.920 --> 51:42.240
closure ideas in auto poise and this framework, essentially.

51:45.640 --> 51:46.520
Cool, cool. So

51:46.800 --> 51:49.480
Maxwell, do you want to do you want to comment maybe briefly on

51:49.480 --> 51:53.360
that before we move on? Like Chris, Chris called out some of

51:53.360 --> 51:54.800
your work there with Dalton?

51:55.520 --> 51:58.360
Yeah, I mean, in a good way, though, I think what Chris is

51:58.360 --> 52:01.120
saying is that he agrees with the direction. I would just say

52:01.120 --> 52:03.560
that this isn't really new work. And this says that you would

52:03.560 --> 52:06.480
Dalton and I are just doing is extending work that Carl did

52:06.480 --> 52:11.600
20 almost 20 years ago. So I see this as more continuous. You

52:11.600 --> 52:14.880
know, someone might say that I'm being overly generous, which I

52:14.880 --> 52:17.720
might be, you know, by looking at this as like one kind of

52:17.720 --> 52:23.320
continuous development. But yeah, I don't really, I think, you

52:23.320 --> 52:26.240
know, you can think of the state based description as sort of

52:26.240 --> 52:29.640
the asymptotic limit of the path based description, the two are

52:29.640 --> 52:37.440
kind of like deeply connected in some sense. So no, I mean, I

52:37.440 --> 52:40.040
think this is real, this is the direction that we want to go.

52:40.120 --> 52:42.560
There's still some interesting stuff that you can say using the

52:42.560 --> 52:47.160
density dynamics formulation. We just have to be you know, it's

52:47.160 --> 52:52.280
like we were discussing Keith during our MLST interview last

52:52.280 --> 52:56.760
time, this is mind physics, right? So, you know, a hallmark of

52:56.800 --> 53:01.120
physics is idealization. And so, you know, necessarily some of

53:01.120 --> 53:04.080
these constructs are going to be, you know, the map has to be

53:04.080 --> 53:06.320
simpler than the territory, it's like we were saying, right?

53:06.360 --> 53:09.680
You know, otherwise, you get you wind up in a boar has novel

53:09.680 --> 53:12.680
with like, you know, a map the size of Los Angeles that you

53:12.680 --> 53:17.600
can't use. So, you know, for certain kinds of oscillatory

53:17.600 --> 53:21.400
cyclical bio behaviors, the non equilibrium steady state is a

53:21.400 --> 53:29.360
perfectly fine, you know, model of it. You know, I drink coffee so

53:29.360 --> 53:32.680
regularly that it might as well be like, you know, deterministic

53:32.680 --> 53:36.840
and like, you know, orbiting the sun kind of thing. So, you

53:36.840 --> 53:39.440
know, this speaks to the fact that the free energy principle

53:39.440 --> 53:42.960
is what it says on the tin, it's a principle. It's a it's a that

53:42.960 --> 53:47.160
leads to a modeling method. And you know, we make some

53:47.160 --> 53:51.720
assumptions, and we're able to say some things. But the principle

53:51.720 --> 53:55.440
itself doesn't rest on any of these assumptions. Like

53:55.440 --> 53:58.480
stationarity, for example, like you don't really need that to

53:58.480 --> 54:01.000
get it to get it working. All you need is a markup like it in

54:01.000 --> 54:04.640
your random dynamical system and you're sort of ready to go. In

54:04.640 --> 54:08.880
terms of like the formalization of the inactive approach, I

54:08.920 --> 54:13.080
always saw this. So, like Chris, by the way, I think this is

54:13.320 --> 54:16.880
under, I don't talk about it very much, but much like Chris, I

54:16.880 --> 54:20.920
started off recalcitrant to the free energy principle. I found

54:20.920 --> 54:25.160
out about this stuff in around 2014. And it, you know, like I

54:25.160 --> 54:28.640
said, I was trained as an inactivist. And this really

54:28.640 --> 54:33.640
conflicted with my intuitions. And I went into this thinking I

54:33.640 --> 54:37.000
need to and this is also what I think the spirit that motivates

54:37.000 --> 54:39.600
a lot of criticism, you go into this thinking I need to

54:39.600 --> 54:43.040
understand this just enough to be able to know for sure that I

54:43.040 --> 54:46.640
don't need to understand this actually. And, you know, you go

54:46.640 --> 54:50.240
into this. And I, you know, I remember having like a conversion

54:50.240 --> 54:56.120
experience reading Carl's 2012 entropy paper called a free

54:56.120 --> 54:59.760
energy principle for biological systems, which was a path based

54:59.800 --> 55:02.320
kind of formulation and everything and really, you know,

55:02.320 --> 55:06.760
seeing, oh, wow, like, there's no, there's no resisting this,

55:06.760 --> 55:09.760
like this is inevitable. And really getting like, oh, yeah,

55:09.760 --> 55:12.440
this is an inevitable consequence of physics, isn't it? Like

55:12.440 --> 55:16.000
there's no, there's no getting around this. And then kind of,

55:16.000 --> 55:19.400
you know, doubling down in my conversion and then becoming a

55:19.400 --> 55:20.440
part of the community.

55:21.000 --> 55:24.280
So what's funny is I had the opposite experience of you two. So

55:24.280 --> 55:27.240
I when I first saw it, I'm like, this is amazing. Like this is

55:27.240 --> 55:31.080
exactly how it works. And now I've been trying to escape ever

55:31.120 --> 55:34.440
since, you know, I don't like being shackled, like to the free

55:34.440 --> 55:37.080
energy principle. And funny enough, we've talked before about

55:37.080 --> 55:39.960
how, you know, Carl, that the free energy principle is one of

55:39.960 --> 55:44.080
the few principles that applies to itself. It's like, as simple as

55:44.080 --> 55:47.320
it is, it can be and still and still work. The other aspect in

55:47.320 --> 55:50.400
which that's true is, as we've been talking about it maintains

55:50.400 --> 55:54.080
this flexibility, or maybe vagueness, you know, critics

55:54.080 --> 55:57.240
might say, but it maintains this flexibility, which leads to

55:57.240 --> 56:00.680
it inevitably generating all kinds of controversy and debates,

56:00.680 --> 56:03.440
you know, and people arguing about like the limits of that

56:03.440 --> 56:04.560
flexibility, right?

56:04.920 --> 56:08.480
One thing I would quickly point out is like, there's this

56:08.480 --> 56:11.480
sense, I think in the literature that there are like 17

56:11.480 --> 56:13.520
different possible interpretations of the free

56:13.520 --> 56:16.120
energy principle, and that you can make it say one thing and

56:16.120 --> 56:19.440
it's opposite. What I've been going around saying is no, that's

56:19.440 --> 56:22.920
not correct. There's only the free energy principle. And it has

56:22.920 --> 56:26.800
the implications that it does. And there are misinterpretations

56:26.800 --> 56:30.560
of the free energy principle. So for example, you know, I

56:30.560 --> 56:33.680
think this idea that some people in the literature have been

56:34.000 --> 56:37.320
pushing that like the free energy principle is even compatible

56:37.320 --> 56:41.120
with this kind of radical anti realism, this kind of, you

56:41.120 --> 56:45.320
know, like a Descartes demon kind of thing. That's not that

56:45.320 --> 56:48.280
just doesn't follow. It's incompatible with the math, like

56:48.280 --> 56:51.240
the you need, you need there to be an actual world out there to

56:51.240 --> 56:54.120
couple to you for the math to get off the ground. So there there

56:54.120 --> 56:56.600
actually isn't a bunch of different interpretations. There's

56:56.600 --> 56:59.840
just the free energy principle. It's just that it's a lens that

56:59.840 --> 57:03.600
makes you makes you see that a lot of the dichotomies that use

57:03.600 --> 57:07.160
to structure the way we think about things are false. This

57:07.160 --> 57:09.360
comes back to the thing that we were discussing at the end of

57:09.360 --> 57:13.920
our interview, Keith. This is sort of like a, you know, you're

57:13.920 --> 57:15.960
sort of abolishing the distinction between the

57:15.960 --> 57:19.960
super lunar re and the sub lunar spheres, right? So classical

57:19.960 --> 57:24.520
mechanics abolishes the distinction that was popular

57:24.520 --> 57:29.600
as scholastic philosophy, which was, you know, like 1000, 1500

57:29.600 --> 57:34.360
years of like, you know, natural philosophy saying, well, I mean,

57:34.360 --> 57:37.080
if you look at the way things behave, the things out there

57:37.080 --> 57:40.920
beyond the moon in the super lunar sphere, right, they move in

57:40.920 --> 57:45.160
perfect orbits, perfect circles, seems to have nothing to do

57:45.160 --> 57:49.000
with, you know, things here that fall to the ground or rise and

57:49.000 --> 57:51.720
have a beginning, a middle and an end. These seem like

57:51.720 --> 57:55.800
radically distinct spheres of reality. But then Newton comes

57:55.800 --> 57:58.720
along and classical mechanics equips you with a set of

57:58.720 --> 58:02.560
equations that apply equally to things here and things over

58:02.560 --> 58:06.360
there, thereby just abolishing that distinction. And I think

58:06.360 --> 58:09.160
like the free energy principle comes around and does undoes a

58:09.160 --> 58:11.760
lot of these false dichotomies in the same way, like we were

58:11.760 --> 58:15.240
talking about internalism versus externalism, it allows you to

58:15.240 --> 58:17.600
say, yeah, there's something to the internalist story, the

58:17.600 --> 58:19.840
internal states are doing something special, but you

58:19.840 --> 58:22.840
actually need the external world to be there to get the story to

58:22.840 --> 58:27.560
kind of pick up. So I think you get a lot of this. And I guess

58:27.560 --> 58:31.680
my hot tag is that the inactivists need there to

58:31.680 --> 58:35.760
be a bright line in the universe, like a bright red line on the

58:35.760 --> 58:39.520
one. And then what's on each side of the line depends on the

58:39.520 --> 58:42.680
inactivists, right? So like, but the story is always something

58:42.680 --> 58:45.920
like there's physics, there's mere physics on one side. And

58:45.920 --> 58:48.000
then there's the interesting stuff on the other side, there's

58:48.000 --> 58:51.360
biology, or maybe there's mind or there's something like that.

58:51.360 --> 58:54.640
And there is this bright red line, like, yeah.

58:55.640 --> 58:58.720
So Max, Maxwell is saying the free energy principle is the

58:58.720 --> 59:01.080
ultimate shade of gray. I hope you

59:03.160 --> 59:05.760
know, I know Tim, Tim, we wanted to move to a new topic.

59:06.600 --> 59:08.960
Yeah, yeah, I mean, there's there's a few things to touch on

59:08.960 --> 59:12.760
there. I mean, certainly the philosophy of, you know, an

59:12.760 --> 59:15.840
activism versus ecological psychology is an interesting one

59:15.840 --> 59:19.680
because with an activism, we get quite a few philosophical

59:19.680 --> 59:24.400
things bagged on that possibly we may or may not want, for

59:24.400 --> 59:28.240
example, the phenomenology, the existentialism, which is this

59:28.240 --> 59:31.240
idea that you can shape your own experience, this kind of

59:31.240 --> 59:34.040
Eastern philosophy, which is that in some sense, there's no

59:34.040 --> 59:38.080
distinction between you and your environment. And it has been

59:38.080 --> 59:42.080
criticized as being quite ill defined and vague. But I think

59:42.080 --> 59:44.800
Maxwell, you have said that there's much more of a tighter

59:44.920 --> 59:49.240
compatibility with ecological psychology. And that's essentially

59:49.240 --> 59:52.720
that we see the world through affordances. And what that means

59:52.760 --> 59:57.040
is that we see the world as trajectories of actions in our

59:57.040 --> 01:00:01.000
physical environment that we live in. And philosophically,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.600
that's a realist ontology. So that means there are no

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.400
representations, we're taking actions in the real world, and

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.760
we know that the real world exists. And now many cognitive

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.960
science people, of course, resist to this notion because they

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:16.640
say we need to have representations. And then we get to

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.560
this interesting discussion that we're having about this kind

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:23.240
of continuum between this idea that on the one hand, there are

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:26.360
no representations if we are Gibsonian, and we are

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:31.800
ecological psychologists. But on the other hand, we might need

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.720
to have increasing levels of representation if we actually

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:39.120
have this temporal depth, if we have these nested Markov

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.960
boundaries, and we are sophisticated minds that are

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:45.320
making predictions into the future. Now with that laid out, I

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:49.320
wanted to talk about this notion of goals. Now in a

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.640
externalist and activist framework, I think that goals

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:57.320
are not something we should explicitly define. Now when you

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.760
speak with go fi people, and they talk about building

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.520
cognitive architectures, they say that goals should be

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:05.520
explicitly crafted into the architecture, at least that's

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:08.040
what they would have said 20 years ago, now they're slightly

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:11.600
more refined. And they say, Well, we should have a goal module

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.520
in the architecture, but the goals should be acquired

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:19.200
empirically, and there should be sub goals and so on. Now, if I

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.200
understand correctly, we were just talking about the free

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.600
energy principle has this notion of paths, and we have

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:30.080
beliefs over trajectories of actions into the future. And to

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.600
what extent is a belief a goal? Because if you have an almost

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.800
infinite number of beliefs, so there's a trajectory to this

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:43.880
future state where I'm rich, but there's also an infinitude of

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.280
other potential trajectories. And they are of course constrained

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.520
by the physical affordances and trajectories that I can take in

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:54.680
my physical environment. That seems different to having an

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:58.880
intention of wanting to be rich or wanting to play tennis,

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:02.840
because I'm constrained in all of these different ways. So yeah,

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.960
why don't we just talk about the dichotomy between beliefs and

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:06.640
goals?

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.720
I think Karl or Chris would be better equipped to answer the

01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:13.960
latter question. Karl in particular has been thinking

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:18.000
about intentional behavior quite deeply recently. I did want to

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.360
quickly comment upon ecological psychology. I have been saying

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.160
to the eco psych community that Bayesian mechanics and eco

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.520
psych are the same discipline. They're really the same thing.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:35.800
Vicente Raja is one of the cooler, more technically

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:40.280
proficient people in the eco psych community. And after a few

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.040
years of back and forth, we've realized that yeah, we're using

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.320
exactly the same set of mathematical tools. The only

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:50.160
framing is the only difference is a philosophical framing is, are

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:55.000
you an indirectist or a directist? Right? So and I happen to

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.880
think that these are just kind of semantic quibbles. If you look

01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.480
at the more contemporary eco psych literature, so the eco

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.640
psych people are tend to be much more sophisticated, technically

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:08.800
than the inactive people. And one thing that they have in

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.440
common is that they don't reject information theory out of

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.600
hand. They want the richer notion of information, like

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:18.080
ecological information or semantic information, some kind

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:21.800
of information that has some relevance to the environment,

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:26.760
you know, the organisms like Melia, it's umvelt, it's, it's

01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:31.160
world of life. But they're not rejecting information theory. In

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:35.400
fact, Gibson's original ambition was to apply physics to the

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:39.240
study of perception just straight up. You know, so it's

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:42.560
all about like, you know, energy, the, the energy on the

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.040
perceptual arrays and all of this stuff. It's essentially, I

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.360
think, the same project from a methodological and

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.640
mathematical perspective. The main difference is just an

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.080
inactive and a an ecological psychologist, sorry, would say

01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:00.480
that we perceive things directly. But then they appeal to

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.000
this, these notions of like resonance and whatever, which

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.600
you know, to us is just synonym for inference. I guess

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:12.200
it's like it, the difference rests in like, are you centering

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.760
on the internal perspective of an organism? Or are you looking

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:19.120
at things as a multi scale stack with the organism kind of

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.000
carving out one level? So we had a great session actually with

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.400
Michael Anderson's Emerge Lab group, based out of Ontario. And

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:34.600
my, my gut tells me that there will be a kind of strategic

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:38.520
alliance, and maybe even just a merging of these two fields,

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:43.920
moving forward. Yeah, and you know, for the more cynical part

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:47.680
of me thinks that the merger of free energy principle and

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:50.320
ecosystem gives you everything that you might want out of

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.360
inactivism, but without any of the, you know, heavy, kind of

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:57.360
metaphysical or philosophical baggage that seems to be, you

01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:02.240
know, hindering progress in that field. So that's my thing

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.600
about eco psych.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:10.160
Okay, maybe we can bring you Chris in on the goals thing. So

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:14.040
is, is a goal in end state? Is it a trajectory? Is it a

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:19.080
bearing? And is it, is it, does it exist explicitly in the

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.760
externalist view of cognition?

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.760
Well, so I'm a kind of more of a practical, computational

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:28.280
person. So I'll leave the philosophy to Maxwell. But I

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:31.000
mean, I tend to take the intentional stats, intentional

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.160
standards on systems, where if we can, if it makes sense for us

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:37.840
to describe a system as a goal directed, then we should do so.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:41.160
And if that helps engineers to build those systems, then they

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:45.360
they should do so, right? But there's a nice kind of, there's

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.600
a nice parallel between those are kind of ideas and the original

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.400
working cybernetics. So there's the, you know, the good

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.760
regulator theorem, which this kind of early work by Conan and

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:56.560
Ashby suggests that any, any control system of a given

01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.720
environment is a good model of the environment that it controls

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:03.880
just by by necessity from first principles, right? Which to me,

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:06.800
which we suggest that we should, in principle, be able to

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:10.880
describe an intentional structure in terms of the kind of

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.800
generative model within within a system, we should be able to

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.960
find it if it is a good control system, and it should exist. I

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.680
think there's also a more practical thing about shifting

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.320
from the notion of reward as this kind of potential function

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:26.200
that's kind of dominated the machine learning area, right? So

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.440
we have this kind of monolithic thing of reward and everything

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:32.240
is in in service of that reward to a richer notion of beliefs

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:35.760
about dynamics, which which which affords that kind of, you

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.880
know, moves away that potential function to a more kind of

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.800
dynamical system so we can get more kind of rich beliefs about

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:44.120
future trajectories and so on. And we know that in control

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.360
systems, that's really, it's really important, right? If we

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:49.560
want to control a system, we're doing model based control, we

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.640
have to have desires on the futures of those systems, we need

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.360
to understand the trajectory and the divergence of the

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.760
trajectories over through time, right? So I think it's a much

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:01.440
richer picture, practically, to think about, you know, beliefs

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:05.080
about dynamics rather than reward. And I think there's this

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.120
nice parallel between the intentional structure and the

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.160
good regulator theory, because I think the good regulator

01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.200
theorem entails that we should find those kind of intentional

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:15.760
dynamics within our systems, right? With just by a priori

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:16.480
first reasoning.

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.800
Yeah, I just want to know if he could explain the good

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.400
regulator theorem, because I think that

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.440
Yes, the good regulator theorem is really strong resonances

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:25.720
with this. And I think, you know, there was a long, there was a

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.080
long time, not Carl, the Carl's exclusive. It's a long time

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.800
the people who were reading the free energy literature to think

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.240
that they're kind of the roots of the free energy principle was

01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:37.160
in Helmholtz, Helmholtzian perception, right, this notion

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.920
of Bayesian inference and perception. But there's kind of

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.760
a much richer reading to see its roots in cybernetics movement,

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.400
and particularly by the works of people like Ross Ashby and so

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:50.440
on. So he basically said, he provided this theorem that

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.400
showed that if you want to build a regulator for a given

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.960
environmental system that optimally regulates that

01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:00.200
system, then it necessitates that regulator is a good model of

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:03.600
that system, right? And there's a kind of you can take that in a

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:07.040
strong way and a weak way and we worried about this for a long

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:11.040
time. But just to diffuse that from its representational kind

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:13.360
of implications, which we worried about for a long time, you

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.720
can see this in something like even like the Watt-Gubner, which

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:18.920
is used as his classic inactivist system that doesn't is

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:23.080
nonrepresentationalist. But there are kind of there's a sense in

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.400
which the dynamics of the Watt-Gubner needs to mirror the

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.080
fluctuations of the the sea management regulating and it's

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:31.680
that kind of coupling and that kind of reflection of those

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.880
dynamics, which is important for the regulation of that system,

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:38.480
right? So that kind of you can back out that, you know, I think

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:40.760
this is very nice to line with the intentional stance and it

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.600
demands an intentional stance. If you if you if you if you if

01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:46.520
you're committed to this notion of the good regulator,

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:46.840
Ferriam.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:50.400
To riff on your point of the intentional son, I think that

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.760
that's a fascinating way of looking at it, Chris. And to

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:56.200
bring you in, Professor, Professor Daniel Dennett had

01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:00.560
this notion of the intentional stance, that when we, you know,

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:04.600
we essentially have a mental model of the intentions of other

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.800
agents. And we use that to understand their behavior. And

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:11.320
an intention is a goal. If you think about it, it's something

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:15.600
I want to do. But in this dynamical systems framework,

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:19.680
it's not explicitly coded anywhere, it kind of emerges. And

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:22.800
of course, it's a subjective state. So we've spoken about

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.160
mental phenomenal states being encoded in our generative

01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:32.160
model in our in our free energy framework. And those states will

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:37.000
of course have intentional, you know, representations of the

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.840
other agents that we're dealing with. So I guess, the question

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.080
back to you, Professor, for instance, how do you goals

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:47.040
kind of get encoded in in this dynamics?

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:52.520
Yeah, that's a great question. I know the answer you want,

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.160
because you don't like goals, do you?

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.840
I don't mind if they're I guess, I guess the answer is they're

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.800
emergent, which is, which is

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:06.640
exactly what I was hoping for that. Yes, they have to, you

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:11.320
know, you have to find a physics where it looks as if there are

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:14.640
goals, and they emerge from a particular kind of self

01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:17.480
organization. I think that's that's been beautifully

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.080
illustrated just in the previous conversations you've had. And

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:28.440
you know, ranging from the work of Ross Ashby on his homey

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.800
stat, which I think would be better nowadays called an

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:34.160
alofstat, but it would be to stick with the homey stat. Of

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:37.920
course, you know, does homeostasis have a goal? Does my

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.520
physiology have the goal of maintaining my temperature at

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:44.400
37 degrees centigrade? It certainly looks like that. Do I

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.800
intend to do that? Well, I think on one reading of intention,

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:54.160
yes, you know, and certainly on an alofstatic reading of

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.600
behaviors that have this temporal depth and are the

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:03.880
consequence of plans into the future, you're putting turning

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:07.720
on the thermostat or putting on clothes. I think then you're

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.960
getting much closer to this sort of more anthropomorphic notion

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.520
of intentionality, whether I think there are girls, there are

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:21.240
there are endpoints. And so I guess that the question then is,

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:24.240
you know, at what point would these different kinds of

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:28.040
intentionality or goal directed behavior emerge from

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:34.160
self organization? And in what particular kinds of systems would

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:37.760
you expect to see this these these these behaviors? I think

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.520
there's some fairly straightforward answers from the

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:44.240
point of view of the physicist, not not the philosopher. So if

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:49.640
you just look at the different kinds of systems that you could

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:54.920
apply the free energy principle to, we've talked about one of

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:58.800
them right at the beginning, when considering Markov

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:02.760
blankets that did not have any have any internal states, for

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:06.560
example, a stone. Yeah, so every state of this thing is just a

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.400
Markov blanket, and it is in reciprocal exchange with the

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:13.920
external states. So that would be when the internal states are

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:17.280
empty. Well, there are other kinds of systems that you could

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:19.400
have. Well, you could imagine systems that didn't have any

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:24.680
active states. But, you know, most interesting systems do

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:28.720
have active states. And then you ask about the rounded

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:32.240
contribution of these random fluctuations to the dynamics of

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.640
you know, the self organization. And if you just follow the

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:42.080
maths through the pathogenical, in particular, maths of the

01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:46.600
dynamics that any system at a particular temporal scale must

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:52.400
have, if it's internal or autonomous dynamics, or the

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.240
dynamics, the flows of the internal states and the

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:59.360
the blanket states that constitute a particle or a person,

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:04.160
when they become sufficiently precise. So when we become big

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:10.080
enough, and cool enough, so let's assume that we're bigger than

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.200
a quantum scale, but not too big to become classical. So we're

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.720
not the size of the moon, but we are roughly your size and my

01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:21.080
size, or perhaps the size of a mouse or an insect through to an

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:25.480
elephant or a giraffe. Then you have this interesting

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:28.320
situation of these very precise dynamics, and they're precise

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.000
just because we are big. So all the random fluctuations are

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.480
averaged away. In this particular case, then you can

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.520
you can show that these particular kinds of things or

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:43.360
Markov blankets have a very well defined probability

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:46.960
distribution over paths into the future, specifically the

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.040
paths of the active states. So let's assume that there are

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:54.240
certain kinds of particles or creatures that have active

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:59.200
states and they have, you know, they and the blanket states

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:03.360
enshroud a sufficient number of internal states. What would

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.800
they look like if they had very precise dynamics? Well, you can

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.120
actually work out the probability distribution over the

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:12.440
active states that over their actions, over their movements,

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.120
and these could be physiological movements,

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:17.200
autonomic reflexes, they could be physical movements, eye

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:21.560
movements, or for ambulatory movements, indeed even talking.

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:28.400
And it transpires that the probability distribution over

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:32.680
these particular paths of active states has an interesting

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:36.080
functional form when written in terms of the potential of the

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:40.400
log probability, we call that an expected free energy. And that

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.480
expected free energy, when you just write it down, passes into

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:51.040
or come can be decomposed into things that people have been

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:57.240
dealing with for centuries, specifically, the expected

01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:01.840
information gain, and the expected reward or utility where

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:10.080
reward or utility is scored by the log probability of occupying

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.560
an attractive state or rewarding state. And I use the word

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:18.080
attractive state deliberately because it is just part of the

01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:25.200
pullback attractor that affords the application of the

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:28.920
pathological formulation. It's just the characteristic states

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:32.720
and this kind of thing occupies. So the the guleness, if you

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:40.560
like, is is inherent in the characteristics of the particle

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.120
or person that you're trying to describe. So for certain kinds

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.600
of particles or persons, then it will certainly look as if they

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:53.160
are acting with long term vision, namely planning in a way to

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:57.000
return themselves to their attracting set, which you could

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:02.120
look you could now regard as a goal or a rewarded or at least

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:09.640
an attracting an attracting outcome or or state of being. So I

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:14.920
think that kind of particle starts to now show the the deep

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:18.560
intention, you know, it looks as if they are they are doing this

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:21.840
because they intend some outcome. I think the next step,

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.080
though, which is the one that you were speaking to possibly done

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:28.600
then it was implying is another, I think, step, which is, but

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:32.560
does the does the internal state know that? You know, am I

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:37.840
aware that I am planning? And of course, that calls upon very,

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.760
very sophisticated, so if they exist, internal or generative

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:47.640
models that entail a model of me and the hypothesis that all of

01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:52.040
this, these sensations and all the consequences of my actions,

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:58.720
which I am not aware of. You know, I cannot feel all the

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:05.240
sensory, not sensory, all the neuronal impulses that cause my

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.680
muscles to contract. All I can register is the consequences of

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:12.320
that through my muscle, my stretch receptors, my proprioceptive

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:17.120
receptors, or if it's in my gut or my autonomic intraceptive

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:22.520
receptors. So I don't know what I'm I can't I can't have I do

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:26.600
have have no access to my actual action. But I can see the

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:31.000
consequences of it and it looks as if I'm planning. So I now have

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:36.600
a hypothesis or a fantasy that I am a thing. And I seem to have

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:41.200
goals. And if I can learn the kinds of goals that I have, then I

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:46.320
can now start to mentalize and have notions in my generative

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:50.000
model about my goals. And then I can notice, oh, you have goals,

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.800
or perhaps it's the other way around. Perhaps the first of all,

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.840
it looks as if the explanation for this random dynamical system

01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:00.400
over here called mom is actually, but she looks as if she

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.720
plans, it looks as if she has goals. And then a few years later,

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.200
if I develop a sense of self, well, perhaps I'm a thing like

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:10.880
mom, but perhaps I have goals. So I think that you're, you're

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:14.600
from the point of view of Dandenit's intentional stance, I

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.280
think we're talking about a very, very particular kind of system

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:23.320
that actually has this capacity to recognize, first of all,

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:28.080
intentional like behaviors, long term planning dynamics in other

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:32.640
things, or things like itself, and then actually transcribe that

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:35.400
and test the hypothesis, well, perhaps I'm a thing like that as

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:36.880
well. Perhaps I'm me.

01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:41.960
And what's beautiful about what you just said there, and all

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:44.440
three of you have said this in different different ways. So I

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.120
want to dwell on this just a bit, because I think it's a source

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:50.640
of the misunderstanding and or controversy about the free

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:53.960
energy principles. So earlier Maxwell, you had said, you know,

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:58.040
it's really a model about the couplings and the isolations

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:00.880
together, the couplings and the decouplings and the dynamics

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:05.920
between them. You know, Carl, you just said, systems will behave

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:09.760
as if they had intentions, whether or not they really have

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:12.960
intentions or not is kind of a different philosophical question,

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:16.440
but they'll behave as if they had intentions. And Chris, you

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:19.320
brought up, you know, the watt governor, which is, it's, it's

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:22.520
obviously a very simple dynamic system, you know, spinning

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:26.480
centrifuge and, you know, arm bar, like whatever else. And yet,

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:30.160
it's, it's not as though it's a literal model in the sense that

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:33.080
I'm going to have a mathematical, mathematical model for what

01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:37.720
the steam engine is doing, but it's behaving as if it were an

01:19:37.720 --> 01:19:40.400
effective model of the steam engine, because hey, when it's

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:43.720
slightly out of sync, the arm flexes a little bit, it readjust

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.920
it's, you know, the spin changes slightly, things continue to

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:51.080
work because if it didn't have the dynamics that were as if it

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:54.080
had a model, the thing wouldn't function, would just fall apart.

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.720
So I guess what we're all, what's all being said here is that

01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:01.960
systems at different scales will behave as if they had a model,

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:05.840
even if they don't necessarily have a model in the sense of a

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:09.760
person, like a person might have a conscious model from which

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:13.320
they develop a plan or whatnot, but all these systems of varying

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:17.680
scales and complexity still behave as if they had a model. They

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:22.000
act to minimize the free energy as a consequence of, you know,

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.960
being random dynamical systems that are self maintaining.

01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:28.720
Yeah, I think that's really eloquently put. And actually,

01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:31.520
that's this is this to kind of underwrite some of the worries

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:34.960
we had about the principle, when we first started walking on

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.080
working on it as kind of coming from an activist or a low road

01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:41.760
an activist, this notion of kind of an explicit

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:44.440
representationalism that you can you can get in these models

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:47.720
where the model is a homomorphic with the environment, right?

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:50.480
And I just just it rankles people who've come from behavior

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.960
based robotics and stuff like this. But then to kind of

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.240
realize that there's a richer relationship between the

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:59.120
internal thing, external that's been mirrored, right? It

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:02.560
doesn't have to be this homomorphic mapping. And also,

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.720
the you know, the actions are deeply involved in carving out

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:08.840
the world that you represent, you live in your own vault. You're

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:11.200
a model of your own vault, you're a model of regulating your

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.720
own vault, which is not, you know, it's not just like this

01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:17.400
static separation of the of the agent from its environment,

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.280
there's this deep coupling, which, which can, you know, which

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:23.640
these kind of mirrorings emerge from. But yeah, I think you

01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:24.840
articulated it really well there.

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:26.960
Can we just

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.040
I saw Carl, any comments here?

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:34.080
No, I think you did a great job. I agree with Chris, like that.

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:34.360
Yeah.

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:39.360
So I think we've got about 15 minutes left. So we'll do two

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.960
more topics. We'll end on structural learning and the

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:44.880
practical implementations of the free energy principle. But I

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:46.800
just wanted to touch on what you were talking about earlier,

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.280
Maxwell, which is this notion of the boundaries being

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.200
potentially vague, or maybe even observer relative. Now, in

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:56.200
your multi scale paper, you did say, use the word ontological

01:21:56.200 --> 01:22:01.280
boundaries, I think. And I also wanted to talk about meaning. So

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:05.400
there's the boundaries of cognition in the physical

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:07.560
world. So we have this dynamical system, and it kind of

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:11.320
converges and we've got these nested kind of hierarchy of

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:15.160
boundaries. But then in a kind of Dennett sense, meaning

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.680
emerges gradually and the meaning kind of depends on your

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:23.120
perspective. And the intentional stance also depends on your

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:26.280
perspective. So different agents could look at different

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:28.920
phenomena going on in their physical environment, and they

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:32.600
could describe different meaning in their generative models. So

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:35.960
we seem to have this kind of weird two tier system where no

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:38.560
longer are we even saying that the boundaries, the marker

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.800
boundaries are fixed, they are potentially variable. And then

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:45.520
the way that the agents construct meaning is also

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:49.280
observer dependent. And all of this is kind of touching on what

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:52.320
I was saying before with goals, which is that the reason they

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:55.840
emerge is because they are unintelligible, they're extremely

01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:01.240
complex. Do you see what I mean? So it feels like the reason why

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.760
we need to have this high resolution generative model is

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:06.440
because in principle, it would be impossible for us to

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:07.760
explicitly program it.

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:16.560
So a few quick things about that. I mean, I think you're

01:23:16.560 --> 01:23:21.240
you're really identifying some of the key issues. I would first

01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:26.920
so with respect to ontology, I would, you know, distinguish

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:32.080
ontology from metaphysics. ontology is just talking about

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:35.760
what kind of things are. So when we say that the boundaries are

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:40.880
ontological, what we're saying is we're trying to capture kind

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:45.800
of features of the map, in some sense. And you know, what we've

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:49.680
argued in a paper recently is that the free energy principle is

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:53.120
metaphorically speaking, a map of that part of the territory

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:58.320
that behaves like a map. So I want to contrast this with

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:02.200
metaphysics in the sense that like this is all of this is a

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:06.880
modeling approach. This is a physics. This isn't saying like

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:10.440
once and for all, these boundaries are here and

01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:17.040
crystallized and just, you know, are there independently of,

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:21.160
you know, the way that we are experiencing or sampling or

01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:25.000
interacting with the world, like that that kind of metaphysical

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:29.440
stuff is not what's at stake. Yeah, so in the paper you're

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.600
referring to, we describe we describe these Markov blankets

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:37.320
as existential boundaries, in the sense that they're both

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:41.040
epistemological and ontological. They're ontological in the

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:45.320
sense that they are definitional of what a thing is, in this

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.200
kind of physics based approach, if you can pick out a thing as a

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:55.840
physical thing, then it has to have this blanket structure. And

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.600
it's it's epistemological in the sense that it's this

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.840
interface, right? Like the thing itself can only know the world

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:06.840
and indeed, we can only know the world, the thing through this

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:11.960
boundary. So like this isn't meant to be a priori. It's

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:15.080
sort of weird. It's in some sense, it's sort of like an app

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:18.600
posteriori. It's like an empirically driven way to

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:19.720
carve up the world.

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:25.560
That's fine. I mean, on that, I think that that answers my

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:29.760
question, because there's always this confusion about whether

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:34.080
we're talking about the map or the territory. And just to be

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:36.640
clear, we are we are always talking about the map when we

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:37.920
talk about these boundaries.

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.480
Yeah, the free energy principle is a map of the boundaries you

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:45.040
can think of and a map of what happens when things have

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:49.320
boundaries that it and so yeah, that that that is important to

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:52.320
keep in mind, like we don't want to engage in map territory

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:56.640
fallacies. The free energy principle is a model, it's a

01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:59.680
scientific model, and it's a map and it turns out to be

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:02.920
the canonical way of modeling systems that are engaged in

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:07.280
modeling. So if maximum entropy is the canonical way of

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:12.400
modeling physical systems in physics, it's the way of arriving

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:16.520
at the most parsimonious model that generates, you know, some

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:20.920
data set, right? Well, the free energy principle is equally a

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:25.320
canonical way of modeling systems that also in turn seem to

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:28.120
be engaged in this kind of modeling behavior. But yeah,

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:33.160
it's a model, it's a map, you know, this probably is not the

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:37.600
final word. And, you know, we're, we're uncovering some, you

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:41.160
know, mathematical structure underneath the free energy

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:45.400
principle and the principle of unitarity and maximum caliber and

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.480
all of this stuff that we're tentatively calling G theory for

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:54.200
now in homage to M theory from string theory physics. So yeah,

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:58.520
you know, as most scientific models, like the progress of

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:02.480
science means that things will probably change. Like again, this

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:07.760
isn't a metaphysics. This is just a cohesive modeling approach

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.720
that inherits from the physics of information and self

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:17.240
organization. I would quickly just point out that the these

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.920
things like seem intrinsically related to observer

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:25.440
dependence, because they are in some deep sense. Carl's 2019

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:29.440
monograph, a particular free energy principle for a particular

01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:33.960
physics ends on this idea that the free energy principle at core

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:37.840
is a metrological statement, where metrological means measure

01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:41.120
theoretic or relating to measurement. And it basically

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:44.200
says, Well, things that exist, look as if they're constantly

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:47.320
measuring themselves and like keeping themselves within

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:51.320
certain bounds. So this is and you know, this is even clearer

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:54.360
from the quantum information theoretic formulation, where

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.000
like literally what we're saying is that the free energy

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.240
principle is a theory of observance, you know, the sort

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.280
of the it from bit, right? Like the it's thing this, but from

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:08.360
another perspective, it's observance, which which are kind

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:12.000
of the same thing. I'm sure Carl could say that again, more

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.960
eloquently than I. But at a high level, that's how I would

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:16.980
respond to your point.

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.920
Maybe Carl would like to give it a go. Yeah, Carl, you could do

01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.600
that. And then also, since you're trying to decide if you're

01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.080
an activist, you know, maybe, what other questions do we need

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:36.040
to ask for both of us actually to decide, you know, that we

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:38.120
haven't, that we haven't covered yet?

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:42.080
Yeah, we can we can ask Max, well, and Chris, to.

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:49.840
So just to pick up on that last exchange and come back to the

01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:54.720
free energy principle as being gloriously gray. I think I like

01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:59.840
that because, you know, the validity of that principle as

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:02.720
a method. So, you know, as a physicist, you would read any

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.360
principle as a method, something that you apply to some

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:11.040
thing. I think is is underwritten, not by its

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:14.960
explanatory scope, but by its internal consistency with other

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:19.480
principles that that people do apply. And I'm, that's what is

01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:23.640
mentioned one. I think one important example of that, you

01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:27.680
know, beyond the principles of least actual variational

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:30.080
principles that underwrite for, you know,

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:35.280
say Richard Feynman's work. I'm thinking of James's maximum

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.480
entropy principle. So Max well alluded to that in terms of

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:43.120
maximum caliber. So maximum entropy of distributions over

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:46.640
states just now becomes transformed into distributions

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:52.520
over paths when you move from when you move to the maximum

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:55.760
caliber principle. So the maximum entropy principle is

01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:00.080
just a Max Janssen Max entropy principle for a pathological

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:04.080
formulation. And I think that's important to raise. The free

01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:07.680
energy principle just is that it is just a constrained maximum

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:10.880
caliber principle or maximum entropy principle. And you may

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:13.280
ask, well, where did the constraints from come from? That's

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.840
just the generative model. It's just in the description of the

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:18.640
characteristic states that pull back a tractor that constitutes

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:21.680
the goals of the principle. And I think that's important to

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:24.640
realise the free energy principle just is that it is just a

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:28.560
that constitutes the goals we're just talking about. So, you

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:32.080
know, if you remember, free energy is just the expected energy,

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:38.160
the constraint part plus the entropy. And therefore, when

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:41.600
you're now drilling down on the constraint part, where does that

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.320
come from? It's just a description of the pullback

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.800
attractor of the characteristic states of the system that you're

01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:50.720
trying to try to understand. So I really look at the free

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:53.600
energy principle as something terribly new. It's been

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:56.720
implicit there all the time. It's just people using slightly

01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:00.560
different words for different concepts. So I think that's I

01:31:00.560 --> 01:31:03.440
kind of why I'm saying this, but it seemed important to say.

01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:07.280
And Max, what were you just talking about? Because there was

01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:08.880
a link in terms of

01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:12.960
were you maybe leading into the metrological aspects, the

01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:13.760
self measurement?

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:17.040
Absolutely. I know that was really important. Yes, that's

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:22.720
right. So just looking backwards. What is the the sibling

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:31.280
of the, or the sibling of the free energy principle of in the

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:34.960
past century, in the past few decades, I think that would be

01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:37.280
the maximum entropy principle, constraint maximum

01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:41.280
entropy principle. Looking forwards, what would be the

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:44.480
bedfellows of the free energy principle? I think that the

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:51.120
that metrological or relational thing is vitally important.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.840
And, you know, I love the work of

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.480
Carlo Revelli and his work with, you know,

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.480
quantum relational approaches to quantum mechanics, which is

01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:08.240
all about relationships. And of course, how do you how do you

01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:12.160
quantify a relationship? Well, it's just in terms of the

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:14.320
interaction, the coupling, which is going to be a sparse

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.480
coupling, it is just a measurement, it is just an

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:20.880
observation. So inference, measurement, synchronization,

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:25.520
sparse coupling, they're all the same thing. And so I think

01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:27.920
that what will hopefully happen is that somebody will write

01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:32.560
down a math possibly Dalton will write down a calculus that

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.960
says all of these things are just the same way of looking at

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:38.480
it. And I read yesterday, because I had to because I was

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:42.480
reviewing this paper for Synthese, about ontic structural

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:47.280
realism, ontic structural realism. And it seems to me that

01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:50.080
that is basically philosophers having discovered the same

01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:55.040
underlying fabric that the reality is in the measurement,

01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:58.800
but it's the measurement of how we relate to each other via

01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:03.680
that measurement of each other or things, measuring other

01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:08.480
things, purely in terms of their relationships. So I think

01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:13.840
that there is a lot of, if you like, work to be done from the

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:19.360
point of view of free energy principle theorists in consolidating

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:22.080
the links to what has gone in terms of things like maximum

01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:25.040
entry principle, and what is to come in terms of, say,

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:29.200
quantum loop gravity or Chris Fields quantum information

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:32.240
theoretic treatment of holographic screens in the

01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:37.760
Markov blanket. At each point, the FEP will become grayer

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:41.600
because it will be less easy to discriminate it from

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.840
everything else that stood the test of time.

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:47.600
Chris, do you have any comments on that?

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.840
You're on mute. You're on mute yet.

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:58.240
You're on mute, Chris. Sorry. So yeah, I think I'll leave it

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.320
there. It's a bit too deep into the philosophy for me, and

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:03.520
we've got two experts here, so I'll pass.

01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:07.840
Wonderful. And to my point earlier, I mean, we won't go

01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:11.920
into it now, but I guess my perspective is it all seems

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:16.480
like epistemology to me rather than ontology, and maybe we

01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:21.040
can debate that a little bit later on. But as our uploads

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:24.000
are all quite slow, and I want to check that we secure this

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.680
beautiful interview, I'm going to cut it off at this point,

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:30.480
but gentlemen, it's been an absolute honor. Thank you so

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.800
much for coming on MLS here. Thank you so much to me.

01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:37.200
Genuinely, always a pleasure, gentlemen. This is always great fun.

01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:43.200
Beautiful. Beautiful. Yeah, I always enjoyed it.
