0	5680	Hello everyone, I'm here to talk to you about a vision of artificial intelligence that goes beyond
5680	12960	machines and algorithms. A vision which embraces humans and nature as integral parts of a cyber
12960	19440	physical ecosystem of intelligence. A vision that is based on first principles derived from physics
19440	25680	and biology. Professor Carl Friston just dropped a paper called Designing Ecosystems of Intelligence
25680	32160	from first principles. And one of the principles is active inference, a formulation of adaptive
32160	38320	behavior which can be read as a physics of intelligence. Active inference says that
38320	43360	intelligent systems are those which can accumulate evidence for a generative model
43360	48320	of their sensed world. In other words, they can learn from their observations and update their
48320	54560	beliefs accordingly. They can also act on their environment to reduce uncertainty and achieve
54560	61680	their goals. But active inference is not about individual agents. It also explains how ensembles
61680	67600	of agents can share beliefs and cooperate through communication protocols. This leads to a formal
67600	75040	account of collective intelligence that rests on shared narratives and goals. So how do we realize
75040	82640	this vision? Friston proposes a research agenda for the next decade and beyond which aims to design
82640	89040	such ecosystems of intelligence from scratch. They suggest developing a shared hyperspatial
89040	94880	modeling language and transaction protocols as well as novel methods for measuring and optimizing
94880	101200	collective intelligence. So why should we care about this vision? It's because it offers a way to
101200	107280	harness the power of artificial intelligence for the common good without compromising human dignity
107280	112400	or autonomy and because it challenges us to rethink our relationship with technology,
112400	118800	nature and each other and because it invites us to join in a global community of sense makers
118800	123840	who are curious about the world and eager to improve it. Enjoy the show.
125520	132480	Our shared human journey is filled with examples of simple ideas that were nonetheless hard to
132480	141520	discover and some that even once explained remain hard to comprehend. Their subtle simplicity
141520	149040	belies their far-reaching and deep consequences. Examples might include the principle of relativity,
149760	157680	quantum mechanics, the principle of parsimony and entropy. I think the free energy principle
157680	166480	is another example, profound and far-reaching yet belied by its simplicity. It has on the one hand
166480	174880	been dismissed as a triviality or even a tautology and on the other hailed as revolutionary
175680	183760	and everything in between. It has the potential to reshape how we view the connection between
183840	192720	inanimate matter and living things and even to answer the question of how and why consciousness
192720	200960	and intelligence might emerge from physical matter and processes. That means a world where
200960	211200	all things from particles to people to the largest systems all move or evolve according to two processes
212000	220000	which combine. The first is a smooth flowing evolution. Think of planets orbiting a star
220640	228800	or waves rippling over water or through quantum fields. The second is a random process that
228800	238400	knocks around the smooth flow in unpredictable ways. Think of twinkling stars or audio static.
238400	247600	You might think of these two processes as a kind of order and chaos or yin and yang forever
247600	258320	intertwined and enmeshed. These two very different effects combine into a chaotic flow which may be
258880	266160	entangled in a kind of tropical storm while still maintaining a semblance of structure
266800	274800	and things. Think about raindrops undulating down to earth in a state of constant flux
275600	283440	yet still droplets or a human being growing and adapting to the surprises of life
284160	292400	all the while remaining an individual physical entity. Biology often asks the question
293200	300960	what must things do in order to exist? Professor Friston has turned that question on its head
300960	310400	and developed perhaps the ultimate existential formalism. He asks if things exist, what must
310400	317200	they do? From the foundation of stochastic differential equations, Friston demonstrates
317200	324400	that things which are defined by a Markov blanket must always move towards a pullback
324400	333520	attractor, a special set of attracting states which maintains the integrity of the Markov blanket
333520	341600	and therefore a thing's coherence and identity over time. One of the profound consequences
341600	350480	of this is that the dynamics of such a system, its laws of motion, will manifest a form of flow
350480	359040	dynamics which can be interpreted as Bayesian active inference. In other words, such a thing
359040	368000	maintains an internal equivalent of a generative model encoding beliefs about the world and itself.
368960	376640	The thing uses the model to decide actions and then performs a Bayesian update based on the outcomes.
378000	386800	For me, the idea that inference, something widely perceived as purely abstract or mathematical,
387600	394800	the idea that it can be driven by simple laws of motion dynamically maintaining the boundaries
394880	402400	between things, maintaining order in the face of chaos is frankly astonishing.
404160	411200	What's more, the free energy principle is so general that it applies at all scales of size
411200	420240	and time leading to an ecosystem of things interacting across scales. Perhaps in that
420240	427440	multi-scale active inference, we might finally find the keys to a mathematics of emergence
428160	436000	and consciousness. This episode is sponsored by Numeri. I'm extremely grateful to them for
436000	441280	sponsoring Machine Learning Street Talk. I mean, remember, I do everything myself on this channel.
441280	446160	It's a lot of time. It's a lot of hard work. It's very expensive. I pay for other software licenses
446240	452960	and all of the equipment. Having that support from Numeri means a lot to me and it means that I
452960	459040	can keep doing what I'm doing basically. Thank you to Numeri. A little bit about Numeri, they are a
459040	465520	data science competition platform to predict the stock market. They've already paid out over $50
465520	473440	million for 5,000 models on their platform. They say that it's the highest paying data science
473440	479200	platform in the world. Now, you can get started really easily for free. They've got a couple of
479200	486000	examples on their GitHub repo actually using XGBoost. The data comes in parquet format so you
486000	491600	can get up and running really easily. You can submit your predictions weekly or daily. You can do it
491600	498720	either manually or you can do it automatically. They provide many, many years of back testing data
498720	504160	as well so you can fine-tune and test your models and do a bunch of statistical diagnostics.
504160	509600	You can work your way up the leaderboard for bragging rights and stake your model with their
509600	516560	NMR cryptocurrency to earn rewards. Staking is a vote of confidence of your model and the reason
516560	523440	they do that is to prevent overfitting and to reduce the bad models from contributing bad
523440	530400	intelligence to their aggregate. Now, a well-performing model is rewarded in proportion to its stake
530400	537440	but a poorly performing model is punished by burning a portion of the stake. Numeri have a
537440	543040	huge community of data scientists of all levels swapping ideas and advice and they have some
543040	548720	community forums as well which you should join. Now, just a personal note from me. This is a form
548720	554080	of betting on the predicted performance of your models which can go up or down. Remember the data
554080	559280	is abstracted from the actual performance of the stocks. They don't correlate to actual stock
559280	564240	performance so there are folks on the platform who've made lots of money but there's also folks who
564240	569760	have lost money as well so please be responsible and only stake what you can afford to lose and
569760	575920	have confidence in. Try to have fun, use it as a place to sharpen up your data science skills
576480	581680	and to be the best version of yourself and use all of the latest models that we've been talking
581680	587840	about here on Street Talk. But yeah, anyway, thank you again to Numeri for sponsoring us.
587840	590640	Professor Friston, it's an absolute honor to meet you.
590640	594080	Well, thank you very much for having me. So we've had you on the show two times now
594720	600560	and in the first show we went into exquisite detail about the free energy principle and active
600640	607920	inference. So you're extremely famous for introducing this existential imperative which is to say
608480	614480	if things survive what must they do? They gain information about the world around them in a
614480	620640	cybernetic loop. We find a model which fits well while maintaining high entropy. If you have a
620640	626240	high entropy model you have greater flexibility to adapt to new information. It's an absolutely
626240	633600	beautiful idea. So welcome. Thank you. Nicely articulated. I was speaking with Keith yesterday
633600	638880	and he said out of all of the guests that we've had on MLST you are by far his favorite and he
638880	644320	says he looks up to you very much so he's very gutted that he couldn't come today to be part of
644320	650400	this. It's very gracious of him though. So you just wrote a paper and it's called designing
650400	656880	ecosystems of intelligence from first principles. You led with this white paper lays out a vision
656880	661600	of research and development in the field of artificial intelligence for the next decade
661600	668800	and beyond. It's denument, I wasn't sure if I was going to say that word, is a cyberphysical ecosystem
668800	675040	of natural and synthetic sense making in which humans are integral participants what we call
675040	680320	shared intelligence. This vision is premised on active inference the formulation of adaptive
680320	685360	behavior that can be read as the physics of intelligence and which inherits from the physics
685360	691680	of self-organization. So you went on and by the way there's an interesting link with Michael Levin's
691680	696800	work here so we had him on the show recently and maybe even transhumanism as well we can get into
696800	701920	that. But you went on you said in this context we understand intelligence as the capacity to
702000	707680	accumulate evidence for a generative model of one's sensed world also known as self-evidencing
707680	713920	over multiple scales and crucially you said active inference foregrounds an existential imperative
713920	720960	of intelligent systems namely curiosity or the resolution of uncertainty and the same imperative
720960	727600	underwrites belief sharing in ensembles of agents in which certain aspects which is to say factors
727600	734320	of each agent's generative model provide common ground or a frame of reference. So can you sketch
734320	741360	some of this out for me? Yes you've used all my favorite words though I presume that I actually
741360	748320	used all the fact to be truthful Maxwell Ramsted was one of the key architect of this so this was a
749120	753280	this white paper was a response to a brief just to think seriously and pragmatically
754000	759360	how this sort of high church theoretical approach to you know intelligence and self-organization
759360	766480	would play out in industry in the way that we actually use technology over the next decade
766480	772640	and that white paper is a product of our machinations and discussions but just drilling down on the
772640	782560	sort of basic message there. The emphasis was as you say on what it is to exist and how that
782560	790800	would manifest in terms of intelligent behavior and to a certain extent certainly I and I think a
790800	797040	number of the other co-authors were reading intelligence as the kind of inference that you
797040	803920	would need to do in order to maintain your existence so hence the existential imperative.
803920	809120	I have to say that's a slightly poetic interpretation of the free energy principle which
809120	814080	is the other way around of course that if you exist it looks as if you are behaving intelligently
814080	820880	if you read intelligence as the right kind of belief updating that enables you to maintain
820880	827360	yourself in some characteristic state so that's essentially what that existential imperative
827360	835520	was all about just one way of reading the physics the mechanics of systems that are open in open
835520	841840	exchange with the rest of their world or their eco niche simply in virtue of the fact that they
841840	848000	are around for an extended period of time and have this characteristic set of states that they occupy
848000	854880	that defines them as the kind of thing that they are. I think the move really that was inspired
855600	861280	by this remit to look okay well that's very nice you can write lots of papers about that and have
861280	867680	nice chats with your friends and colleagues about it about how does that actually work in practice
867680	874800	and of course in practice you have to think about where you're going to deploy this perspective
874800	880560	deploy the kind of technology that would you know ensue from that perspective and of course we're
880560	885600	talking about communication we're talking about a universal world of lots of creatures like me
885600	893200	and you so now we get to the next level of application of these existential imperatives
893840	900560	in the context of not just intelligent behavior and just open brackets behavior here
901120	910160	it's quite important you know often I hear underwriting the move from AI artificial intelligence
910160	917360	to IA where it's intelligent agents that have the artifacts with agency that do have behaviors that
917360	924080	have a sentient kind of behavior or at least an intelligent kind of behavior close brackets
925280	934400	so we're now moving from thinking about a single thing a particle or a person or a computer
934960	940400	and thinking now about having lots of things that are talking to each other and they're
940400	946400	coexisting so now we're in the world of distributed intelligence distributed cognition
947520	955040	and one thing which you mentioned explicitly this notion of belief sharing so now we're in
955040	960720	a different kind of world where we're thinking okay we think we understand the imperatives for
961280	968000	good behavior the necessary kinds of behaviors that you know I think you highlighted curiosity I
968000	975200	think is absolutely central in terms of you know hallmarking and characterizing the kinds of behaviors
975200	981040	that you and I engage with or truly intelligent or sentient behavior would entail but now the idea
981040	987120	is well what would that look like and when you've got lots of these things talking to each other
987120	991440	well we know what it looks like we talk to each other literally so it's all about language it's
991440	998560	all about belief sharing shared intelligence distributed cognition would be one thing that
998560	1005760	you might find in the in the life sciences if you're a computer scientist it's all about sort of
1005760	1013840	the right kind of message passing on very very large factor graphs if you're if you're a linguist
1013920	1021440	or into evolution in psychology it's all about neat cultural niche construction the
1021440	1026800	emergence of language so I found that quite fascinating as something which you know you
1026800	1032400	really had to get on top of to think well what next and what kind of technologies would you need
1032400	1040000	to realize and what would they look like you know one way that's been framed to me by my new friends
1040000	1050000	now in industry is you know what would what's it going to look like what what is AI or now AI going
1050000	1057440	to look like in the future taking the kind of perspective you know over the decades or indeed
1057440	1062800	centuries where you're moving from sort of the industrial age to the age of information I think
1062800	1067520	the notion now is we're now coming to the end of the age of information now we're in the age of
1067520	1073600	intelligence and think about what what that might look like and how would one equip people with the
1073600	1080160	right kind of technology and infrastructure to you know to realize the potential of shared
1080160	1085600	intelligence essentially yeah that's very interesting so we spoke with Luciano Floridi
1085600	1090560	Oxford and he's invented this philosophy of information and he talks about the infosphere
1090560	1095840	and how we're at we're out we now have third order technology essentially so things like Amazon and
1095840	1102880	Facebook and he talks about the diminishment of our ontology and agency in the infosphere
1102880	1107440	and using this information as a substrate thing I think is very interesting because that's kind
1107440	1112400	of alluding to what you're going to but you said something actually in your paper which gave me
1112400	1118400	pause for thought you said the the AI age may end up being a distributed network of intelligent
1118400	1124400	systems which interact frictionally in friction frictionlessly in real time and compose into
1124400	1129440	emergent forms of intelligence at subordinate scales as you were just alluding to and the
1129440	1135200	nodes of such a distributed interconnected ecosystem may then be human users as well as
1135200	1141200	human designed artifacts that embody or implement forms of intelligence now this really did make
1141200	1148160	me wonder because I think we're already there now and so when when we had Floridion he was talking
1148160	1152800	about how our digital identity has already distributed we were consumers and then we
1152800	1157760	became barcodes and now there's this kind of infinite fractionation in the infosphere and
1157760	1163840	it's almost as if humanity isn't the substrate anymore information is the substrate and he said
1163840	1169360	you can devalue human skills you can remove remove human responsibility you can reduce human control
1169360	1174160	you can erode human self-determination but the rock that thought that little drop of water was
1174160	1181040	nothing 18 years later has a hole in it because drop after drop after drop the drop will shake the
1181040	1186080	stone will shake the rock and I think what he meant by that is being ensconced and enmeshed in
1186080	1191600	technology to such a high degree and information being the first class citizen in our society is
1191600	1197360	kind of truncating our very existence I mean what would you say to that beautifully beautifully
1197360	1203600	expressed very poetic and I'd have to think about that very carefully I'm sure there are deep truths
1204400	1211200	and certainly from from the point of view of a physicist your information is obviously the thing
1211200	1218160	it is it is in many respects the you know the substance of our universe and our existence and
1218160	1224160	you're also acknowledging that energy is information and energy is just a potential and so
1224160	1229680	we're all about we're all in the game of realizing potentials in a sort of folk psychology sense but
1229680	1235920	also literally in terms of minimizing certain potentials for example self-information would be
1235920	1241280	the free energy potential that you're that you're minimizing the surprise and again coming back to
1241280	1246640	this sort of making you know belief sharing in the service of minimizing minimizing a surprise
1246640	1253680	and realizing our potential so I but I don't see that as a negative thing I think that's just an
1253680	1260720	acknowledgement that you know at the end of the day the way that we model and articulate and talk
1260720	1270640	about ourselves our lived world whether we're a quantum physicist speak a statistical physicist
1270640	1277280	or a classical physicist or have an interest in in the equivalent mechanics at each of those
1277280	1282880	levels it's all about information it's all about the probability of being in this particular state
1282880	1288400	you just take the the negative log of that that is the self-information of this particular state
1288400	1295040	so it's all you know if you look at quantum physics you know what else is there it boils down to
1296000	1302160	in its sort of most elemental and scale free or background free form and quantum information
1302160	1306960	theory and say if you can reduce it to you know to quantum information theory which many people
1306960	1312880	including friends of Mike Levin and I think one can then I think there's a there's a deep truth
1313600	1320640	that we are just realizations of information particularly from my perspective of course
1322160	1331280	we being a thing what what kind of information processing would be apt to describe us that could
1331280	1336960	be you know articulate in terms of quantum information theory it's belief updating so we come
1336960	1343040	back to the Bayesian mechanics that you can put on top of this underlying you know sort of information
1343040	1349520	theoretic probabilistic description of the world but I guess I'm sort of reading between the lines
1349520	1355360	and the twinkle in your eye is the idea that each one I get across is that maybe quite bad for
1355440	1360480	humanity is that the idea is it all that's what that's what he thinks and I mean he thinks
1361360	1367600	you're a computationalist you think that information is the kind of primary substrate
1367600	1372000	and in a way he's also worried that information is becoming the primary substrate but the big
1372000	1377440	difference between you and 3d is that he thinks that humans are special he thinks that we like
1377440	1383200	can't we have autonomy we choose our own actions you know we can't be replicated in silica so he
1383200	1388480	thinks essentially that there's no such thing as general intelligence that there's just algorithms
1388480	1396080	that perform skills and it's our humanity which is being truncated I see right okay well I would
1396080	1402960	be very sympathetic to that yes I mean we are special kinds of intelligence and one could
1403760	1408480	equip that argument with you know what is the definition of sentience what's a bright line
1408480	1416640	between you know a very clever thermostat or some machine learning artifact or a virus
1417680	1422800	and you and me I think there is a bright line and you of course you've just said what it is it's
1422800	1429760	the autonomy it's the agency it's ability to plan and the all the existential imperatives that
1430960	1436000	underwrite that planning and then we come back to curiosity so but if he's saying that
1436880	1443520	are the fact we are here realize the fact we are curious creatures and because we are
1445280	1450640	we populate a universe that comprises creatures like us we're all curious about each other
1450640	1456880	then I would certainly say yes that is a definitive aspect of us which is not found I think
1458720	1464720	I'm just thinking carefully I'm sure you can find examples but you know I don't in the kind of
1464800	1471120	artificial intelligence that we currently interact with in exchange with you don't have that planning
1471120	1480240	and curiosity they don't have the you don't have bait into the optimization framing of you know
1480240	1486720	what makes a viable or a good bit of intelligence you don't actually have bait in universally
1487760	1494400	this expected information can this curiosity and in that sense I think he's probably absolutely
1494400	1502720	right and in a sense the belief sharing getting to that the right kind of belief sharing of the
1502720	1508880	kind that the white paper was talking about is predicated on the notion that you will now be
1508880	1515760	able to equip sentient artifacts that we make with curiosity and maybe asking well what are
1515760	1520560	they going to be curious about their world what is their world it's you and me and the other
1520560	1524240	artifacts so they're only going to be curious about you and me they're going to be interested
1524240	1531920	in you and me so we're talking about you know a Siri or a Google Maps that starts to ask you
1531920	1538000	questions instead of you asking them questions so that I think that's that's one way of eluding his
1538000	1547360	his sort of rather dystopian attitude to the other the information is king I think information is
1547440	1557440	king belief updating is king the belief updating is you know of course the thing that ensues once
1557440	1563680	you act upon the world to do some smart data mining to you know to respond to some epistemic
1563680	1572400	affordances and you know the question then is you know what kinds of systems do that and the moment
1572400	1577600	I would argue it's probably just us there are other examples of some beautiful examples in
1578720	1583360	say active learning using machine learning you know to design your own experiments and
1583360	1590880	optimize the actual experiments and say drug discovery or molecular biology so I mean that
1591760	1596800	there is a long history both in statistics and in machine learning of active learning
1596880	1602080	that I think does have the potential but I don't see it really being
1605120	1612960	well from what I understand in discussions I don't see that being a bedrock of the way forward
1612960	1621840	an explicit part of the design for an age of intelligence that is puts us sympathetically
1621840	1627760	in an ecosystem of intelligence and that's really what that white paper was trying to think what you
1627760	1634800	know what would it look like and what would happen if your google maps became very curious about you
1634800	1643200	particularly I mean at google maps I think well there are two sort of sort of metaphors here
1643760	1655200	which might sort of ground the framework or the perspective that I'm trying to think about this
1655200	1666880	worry and one which I found very helpful again coming from my colleagues in industry is just trying
1666960	1677360	to explain the nature of shared intelligence and distributed intelligence and the analogy here would
1677360	1683520	be the brain you know you've got really smart little elements little neurons I mean they're
1683520	1688880	really smart and in fact if you get into the weeds of dendritic computation incredibly smart little
1688880	1694640	things that are in receipt of their sensations and they act by some pinging they don't know who
1694640	1698640	they're pinging but they're pinging away sending out little action potential or messages down down
1698640	1706000	the axons the wires that are emitted from from the nerve cells and you've got you know 10 billion of
1706000	1710640	these things and they're all very very smart but would you call any one of them autonomous would
1710640	1717360	be called would they have agency in an elemental sense I think they do but it's when you put them
1717360	1722720	all together lots and lots of little smart things together do you get this emergent kind of intelligence
1722800	1731120	that you could undeniably say has the capacity to roll out into the future to you know generate
1731680	1737840	fantasies or counterfactuals that are all conditioned upon what I'm going to do next where
1737840	1746640	I now becomes this collective so this is the kind of emergent behavior that emerges from
1747280	1752240	getting lots of little smart things to talk to each other in the right kind of way so that
1752240	1756720	that's you know I think quite a helpful analogy by what is meant between you know about shared
1756720	1762640	intelligence and what might you know might arise clearly a lot of these little smart brain cells
1762640	1768240	be analogous to you and me a lot of others would be all kinds of apps and you know
1770480	1778000	giving you now the potential to see through the eyes of any smart app that knows what you want
1778000	1783840	to know and is curious about what you want to you know to find out again coming back to this notion
1783840	1792080	that belief sharing I think is already there in the context of say you know sat nav you know I
1793440	1799680	share my beliefs about my preferred states of being my characteristic preferences are one part of the
1799680	1806080	you know the imperative suite for policy selection or good plans I share that with in terms of a
1806080	1811280	destination with some shared world model or shared narrative between me and my sat nav
1812720	1820240	in this instance of a geographical world model and then it has beliefs about the best policy
1820240	1826720	it makes a little plan and then it shares its beliefs with me again so I think that you know that
1826720	1832640	to the extent that your colleague in Oxford was saying we're already there I think that
1832640	1836320	that's absolutely right I mean you know we already have this kind of belief sharing
1837360	1845680	I think that the move though is to make that a much more symmetric belief sharing you know
1845680	1851200	I'm asking the app for its beliefs for its I'm asking it to behave as a recommender
1852560	1860240	and it only knows what I tell it so it has no autonomy but if it was now in a position to
1861040	1868400	actively smartly resolve its uncertainty about me the user then that's much more of a sort of
1868400	1875680	you know a balanced symmetrical dynamic interaction between me and the app and the agenda here
1875680	1883280	is not to create paper clips or make money the agenda remember is just to resolve uncertainty
1883920	1889520	the state curiosity and to move towards the state of greater mutual understandings
1890960	1900960	that's a sort of the non-dystopian view of information sharing so Shane Legg said that
1900960	1905440	his definition of intelligence is the ability of an agent and we're using words here like
1905440	1910080	agent we'll get to those words in a minute being able to solve a variety of tasks in different
1910080	1916880	environments Francois Chorlet said it's efficiently creating abstractions given limited prize and
1916880	1924720	experience Pei Wang says it's the adaptation efficiency over finite resources so when you
1924720	1929520	look at definitions of intelligence typically they focus on principle and function which I think
1929520	1937280	your one does or capability or behavior or structure now the interesting thing about the
1937280	1941360	principle one in particular is I think it's the least anthropomorphic and I think yours is the
1941360	1948160	least anthropomorphic definition I've ever heard of so and also this concept of grounding in the
1948160	1954720	physicality of information rather than reality itself and whether they are the same thing of
1954720	1961360	course is a philosophical discussion that maybe we'll park for another time but yeah how would
1961360	1967840	you contrast your definition of intelligence from these other ones well I think you've already
1967840	1976160	done that you've you've said it's you know it's a minimal essentially a physics based definition
1976160	1983120	of intelligence which requires you know a move or indeed a complete commitment to staying in the
1983120	1991200	space of information and information geometries and belief updating so having said that I think
1991200	1997040	all of those definitions touch upon some essential aspects of intelligence every one of them rang
1997040	2006160	true you know to my ears and I could read every one of those as being one key foundational aspect
2006160	2012640	of what would emerge if any self-organizing system managed to supervise and coexist with
2012640	2017680	other self-organizing systems from the point of view of you know of the free energy principle
2018240	2026080	or the sort of first principle approach so there are no axioms and no assumptions the question is
2026080	2033600	not you know what is quintessentially anthropomorphic the question is what emergent properties of
2033600	2039920	certain kinds of self-organizing systems would qualify as having that that bimimetic and then
2039920	2045360	ultimately anthropomorphic aspects to them you don't even have to go to anthropomorphism I mean if you
2046320	2053040	were talking as you have been to Mike Levin and his friends you know they would talk about basal
2053040	2060480	cognition they would talk about you know just a multicellular organism is a beautiful construction
2060480	2066560	of that rests upon orthopoiesis self-assembly of individual cells but also cells of cells and
2066560	2071520	you know how does a surface cell an epithelium know that he's on the surface and how does that
2072240	2079040	individuate the internal cells of an organ or an organ from the rest of the environment so that you
2079040	2089920	know the kind of intelligence that has this anthropomorphic feel I think people are also
2089920	2094560	seeing in biotic self-organization that would be a long way away from the kind of
2095200	2099280	folk psychology intelligence that we're talking about and yet it rests upon exactly the same kind
2099280	2104480	of mechanics and you know for me that would be the Bayesian mechanics that come from the
2104480	2110160	you know the dynamics of systems that are self-organizing open systems that are self-organizing
2111600	2122400	so you know you talked about so adaptation has been one aspect one common theme in the
2123040	2128480	the sequence of definitions you gave I think does speak to this bright line between
2129440	2134880	basal cognition and biotic self-organization biological intelligence of the kind you can
2134880	2141520	read in many many different ways your your DNA for example your genotype is an intelligent
2141520	2148320	information accumulating device on the point of view of evolution you know it it stores all
2148320	2153760	the information about what it would require to build a phenotype that's fit for purpose in this
2153760	2159280	particular environment so you know that's a kind of belief updating that's a kind of intelligence
2159280	2163200	but it doesn't have what we were talking about before which is this capacity to plan
2163760	2169120	evolution doesn't plan you could also argue that the the worldwide web doesn't plan
2170880	2174880	google maps you could argue does plan to a certain extent because it's certainly
2174880	2180960	so what's the difference the difference is I think implicit in at least the first two of your
2180960	2186960	of your definitions which is this notion of counterfactual futures this notion of
2188080	2195360	you know imagining a future or putting it another way having a world model or a generative model
2196560	2201920	that explains things that are not tied to the moment so if you're a physicist what you're
2201920	2208880	talking about is now a probabilistic mechanics a Bayesian mechanics or possibly just you know an
2208880	2214080	information theoretic mechanics based upon paths through time so we're talking about things like
2214080	2219600	the pathological formulation and you know but crucially we're talking about trajectories that
2219600	2225440	don't cannot be localized to this point in time that necessarily entail the future and indeed the
2225440	2231280	past so I've you know that notion of freeing yourself in a you know I can't remember the
2231280	2234640	name the philosopher now I can't remember the name I just can't pronounce it so I'm going to pretend I
2234640	2241280	can't remember well there are people who there are there are the philosophical schools that
2241280	2246720	emphasise this temporality aspect now you know and if you just look at physics look at contributions
2246720	2250720	of Richard Feynman for example it you know it's all about the pathological formulation
2251440	2261200	and so I think as soon as you talk about the elements to which the information geometry
2261200	2268480	as an intelligence and autonomy all of these things could apply are not states they are
2268480	2276800	trajectories dynamics narratives paths that have this this sort of future pointing aspect
2277520	2285360	um then being able to select among different futures becomes an emergent property of this
2285360	2291680	kind of sense making this kind of autopoiesis under you're read as a Bayesian mechanics of
2291680	2296800	self-organisation and just thinking about your definitions they all have that aspect of choosing
2296800	2304880	among different futures or considering or having abstractions um you know about what might happen
2304880	2312960	if if this so for me that that is one way of expressing curiosity because to be curious you
2312960	2318720	have to imagine well what would happen if I did that and what would I know if I did that but you
2318720	2324480	have to imagine it before it's actually happened which you know is is for me the big bright line
2324480	2330880	between you know between the anthropomorphic kind of intelligence and the intelligence you find in
2330880	2338320	the thermostat or in the you know a variation autoencoder yeah um later on we will decompose
2338320	2343520	the different aspects of cognition and I think as well as thinking it can be knowing and acting
2343520	2349840	as well and and we'll we'll talk to that but you said words you know action agent per se
2349840	2357680	goal plan behavior and I guess and I posed this to Levin as well it feels like these are terms
2357680	2362240	that we understand because we have cognitive priors like agentiveness and so on these are
2362240	2368400	things that that we understand that might actually only be a lens into something far more complicated
2368400	2375200	and just to touch on the information traversal points over a geometry that's very interesting
2375920	2381280	and I'm no expert but I think the medial temporal lobe deals a lot with spatial
2381280	2388160	contiguity and we have grid and place cells etc etc so it you know at a macroscopic level
2388160	2393120	in our brain it's a first-class citizen but there's also this hierarchy isn't there
2394080	2399120	when does it start happening you know do single cell organisms plan into the future
2400000	2406480	and to the previous point is planning necessarily a reductive lens of intelligence
2407040	2413360	you brought up loads of interesting things there you you call me by the reductive lens that's a
2413360	2418240	lovely phrase what does that what does that mean well um I didn't mean it in a purer sense but
2418240	2426160	when when we use words like you know like we we we say intelligence must do x y and z it must plan
2426160	2433120	it must reason it must act and we have this cybernetic loop and so on and I I have a theory
2433120	2440080	that this is just the way we understand things I see and and in a sense it's a lens onto a much
2440080	2445600	more complicated thing and and the reason this is interesting is the reason why we have people
2445600	2453920	like john so who says that the um the impenetrable realm of the subjective experience is beyond
2453920	2459760	function dynamics and behavior it's a little bit extra and and even and morality is another example
2459840	2464320	talk about that later that feels like it's something which is a little bit extra so there's
2464320	2469760	always this question of to what extent is intelligent behavior deducible from the models and the
2469760	2478400	words that we use yes I think that's a fundamental point uh you said um okay now I understand what
2478400	2483440	a reductive lens is I like that I like them I like it for many reasons of course because um
2484160	2489920	well first of all um it certainly is not uh you I don't think it could ever be used in a
2489920	2498480	pejorative sense um but it does speak to um two fundamental themes which is um the the way that we
2498480	2506640	do make sense of our world through coarse-graining through reducing uh through having um intuitive
2506720	2514800	models of the way that the world works um ultimately could be um um seen as language
2514800	2519920	words um could be I think could also be seen at quite to kind of as physics and maths as well
2519920	2526880	to be quite honest um you know these these the more I read about you know modern mathematicians
2526880	2532240	and physicists talking about that you know their skills and and the the legacies that they they
2532240	2538320	enjoy the more I I realize it's all changing all the time it's just another kind of reductionism um
2538320	2543520	but language particularly but it's a right kind of reductionism and I guess what you're saying is that
2543520	2550960	you know um we have this um way of summarizing classifying certain kinds of behavior which may
2551600	2557360	not truly reflect the underlying complexity the beauty of what's going on underneath
2558240	2562640	that at that that point I would go the other way I would actually say that do not properly
2562640	2569040	reflect the underlying simplicity of what's going on to be quite honest you know this comes back to
2569040	2576080	you know the um unashamed use of phrases like sort of existential imperatives and self-evidencing
2576080	2580560	yes yeah we're just here we're just we just have characteristic steps and sets we're just
2581280	2587520	realizations of some glorious um launch of our equations and all these stories about sort of
2588240	2595440	belief updating and sentience and intelligence and just reductive stories that make sense of
2595440	2603760	you know what we you know what um what we must um or can if indeed to a certain extent the free
2603760	2608080	energy principle itself I think is a reductive story of that kind you know when I say if you
2608080	2612560	look at things through the lens of Bayesian mechanics or as if I think the free energy principle
2612560	2618560	is another example of of this kind of reductive thing it's a looking at something which is inherently
2618560	2622880	much more simple than the lens through which you're looking at which is the Bayesian mechanics
2622880	2628400	and the free energy principle so I think that's absolutely right a really interesting idea um
2628480	2636480	um so uh and at another level I think it speaks to some key issues you know I mean you're um
2637280	2644800	you you're often um then confronted with you know okay I'm talking with you about agency
2644800	2653120	and agents and me and you uh so what license is that what aspects of my implicit world model
2653360	2660320	or generative model endow me with a sense of me and you and indeed me as agent and you know what
2660320	2667920	would that look like if I stripped away um different levels of meta awareness or meta uh
2667920	2674080	cognition if you're a psychologist and uh and just had a minimal selfhood um you know is just be
2674080	2680960	having plans um sufficient to call me an agent even if I don't know if I'm an agent if I have plans
2681600	2688320	who else is going to act you know enact those plans I mean I would love to go there slightly
2688320	2694960	later but there's so much we can say about um agency and the boundaries and also the causal
2694960	2700560	pressures between agents and also whether you can think of boundaries as being observer relative
2700560	2705840	but I just really wanted to go to the universal um algorithm thing that you spoke about before
2705840	2712240	because I think it's delicious so um I think it's fair to call you a universalist and that and that
2712240	2716080	that's that there are quite a few universalists actually that these are people who think there's
2716080	2720240	a simple underlying principle and this is in contrast to what we were just talking about
2720240	2726640	which is that the reality is more complicated than we'll ever understand and we have a truncated
2726640	2732800	cognitive horizon and we as Chomsky says we just have kind of um simple primitives built into us
2732800	2737920	that help us frame and and understand a kind of abstraction space within a certain cone
2738560	2742960	but um I was reading professor Christopher Somerfield's book at Oxford I interviewed him last week
2743600	2750000	and he said in his book um could it be that the um success of mammalian brains is not due to any
2750000	2755920	careful crafting into a mosaic of different functional subsystems but instead is merely due
2755920	2760560	to size we know there's a powerful relationship between the sheer number of neurons and the
2760640	2766720	complexity of behavior he went on he said researchers and neuroscientists alike such as
2766720	2772480	Carl Friston and uh Jeff Hawkins and even Andrew Ng have flirted with the idea that there might be
2772480	2778320	a single algorithm which underpins intelligence with the brain acting like a massive TPU repeating
2778320	2784400	instructions ad nauseam to generate complex behavior so it's a fascinating idea is that a fair
2785040	2791520	summation yes what's a TPU in this oh well a tensor pro programming unit it's a very
2791520	2798880	powerful computer right yeah I learned another new acronym but my world is full of new acronyms
2798880	2809600	right okay um yeah um so what which his argument there is it's something to do with um scale and
2809600	2816400	size is is that well not not only that I mean we'll we'll get to there's a guy called Rich Sutton
2816400	2823440	and he he had this um you know bitter lesson essay and it's a warning against hand crafting um
2824080	2829360	structures architectures because it bottlenecks it doesn't scale so this universalist idea is that
2829360	2833920	you know maybe and and Jeff Hawkins says the same thing he's got this thousand brains theory of
2833920	2839840	intelligence yes and the idea is that there's a very simple underlying algorithm or principle
2839840	2846960	and you just replicate it you scale it up or out and that produces emergent intelligence right
2847680	2860880	yes well okay then I am a universalist so um you know but both of those the way you described it
2860880	2867680	do speak to some I think very pressing issues about um structures and structure learning um
2868400	2872880	that you know you could either um read from the point of view of machine learning and sort of
2872880	2877280	graph learning what's the rights you know how many layers does this particular deep learning
2877360	2881840	architecture need or what kind of factorization are going to put in play
2884800	2892720	or if you were um you know um radical construct a radical constructivist this you know that that's
2892720	2897520	where you know I've often heard people like Josh Tenenbaum for example think about sort of structure
2897520	2903680	learning and um from the point of view of the universalist I've now learned that new word now
2903680	2911600	that's good so as from as a universalist then you are certainly looking for the one principle
2912640	2922720	that is redeployed at successive scales and that should be a sufficient explanation for
2923440	2931280	those things that show emergent behaviors at particular scales so I think that you know
2931520	2937680	that is absolutely true and again you can read this from the point of view of a mathematician
2937680	2942880	from the point of view of um the renormalization group and what does that mean what it just means
2942880	2948480	that you know if I take lots and lots of little things um and I start course training them in a
2948480	2955520	particular way um then if I want to describe the behavior of all the elements at one um scale of
2955520	2964800	organization say molecules or cells or people um then if I can write then down their dynamics
2964800	2970880	in terms of say Lagrangian you know so some way of summarizing their dynamics that um and all the
2970880	2979600	things that um accompany or ensue from those dynamics um then if I do my course training
2980480	2987120	um and then look at the collective the average behavior of say lots of cells a place cell or
2988320	2994080	entire medial temporal or entire person um at a more macroscopic level then I should
2994640	2999120	be able to recapitulate the same functional form of the dynamics and all the Lagrangian
3000480	3006720	so from that point of view um you have a particular kind of universalism that is
3006720	3012000	actually scale free because you get the same principle emerging at every level and that that
3012000	3018240	is basically um one um one way of looking at the deployment of the free energy principle
3018240	3022240	is asking what would it look like when deployed at different scales so you can deploy it at the
3022240	3029520	level of dendritic self-organization you can deploy it at the level um of um your uh neuroscience
3029520	3035040	you could deploy it at the level of um morphogenesis and cellular pattern formation
3035040	3042960	we've done that with Mike Levin um the idea being that this the same universal principle
3042960	3048480	works at every every level then the interesting game comes between the coupling between the levels
3048480	3055520	how does one level constrain um and inform or contextualize the level below and vice versa
3055520	3062160	you know and this I think is a really important sort of um issue which is probably well rehearsed
3062240	3067760	in many different disciplines ranging from say evolution so evolution as a free energy
3067760	3073840	minimizing process where free energy is literally the um the the negative abound on the negative
3075440	3081200	log marginal likelihood um I name it the likelihood of finding me this phenotype here
3081200	3087360	when sampled at random from a population um how does that scale of a free energy self
3087360	3092320	auto poetic process you know natural selection basic model selection if you're a statistician
3092320	3099920	how does that provide constraints on the exactly the same principles um of active inference and
3099920	3108000	learning um in developmental time for any given phenotype and then the that would be the top
3108000	3112480	down causation the bottom up causation from one scale to the next scale would be you know how does
3112480	3117920	my behavior my experience experience dependent plasticity my evidence accumulation all my good
3117920	3124640	Bayesian decisions how does that now um mean I contribute to the gene pool at the at the
3124640	3130480	evolutionary level yes so you know that that that would be one way of reading it the other way of
3130480	3136960	reading it of course is just if you're designing um a tpu or deploying a tpu um you've got that
3136960	3142880	you've got message passing on some graph what is a graph well it only has interesting structure
3142880	3148560	in virtue of the um the sparsity or the connections that are not there otherwise it's a full graph
3148560	3157040	and it's not where you saw for anybody speaking to Chris's Christopher's uh uh you know too too big
3157040	3163520	too many neurons um you can't you you necessarily have to have a sparsity to fit all those neurons
3163520	3170000	into um I would put it the other way around though I would say that um anything that is adaptive and
3170000	3177840	has this size uh you know what properties must it possess and I would I would suggest that it has to
3177840	3187760	comply with the principles of um self-evidencing um where evidence now is the marginal look the
3187760	3193520	marginal likelihood that can always be read as accuracy minus complexity so as if it exists
3193520	3197440	and it's big it's got to be minimally complex what does that mean it's going to have the
3197440	3201600	smallest degrees of freedom uh the minimum number of connections in so you should be
3201600	3211360	able to predict the sparsity from the first principles at every scale so that sparsity
3211360	3215120	defines the nature of a graph and indeed if you're talking about anything that's deep
3215120	3220880	in a hierarchical sense all you're saying is there's a particular kind of graph um that I
3220880	3226800	have in mind and it you know has a certain sparsity structure but crucially it's a sparsity
3226800	3232720	structure that allows me to call it a hierarchy it means that there are no connections that transcend
3232720	3238960	unlike a sort of you know a u-shaped uh no it's still hierarchical to anyway sorry I'm
3239040	3244320	getting a bit distracted right the choice of graph so I mean I think that's sort of um
3244320	3252240	the notion of um coupling between different hierarchical scales is absolutely crucial
3252240	3258480	from many different perspectives renormalization group evolution um you know getting the right
3258480	3261680	graphical architecture and your method passing scheme and computer science so
3262560	3268320	yes I wanted to bring that up but I discussed um it's actually the same thing with Levin so
3268320	3275040	morphogenesis and the rungs of the emergence ladder and the causal pressures between those
3275040	3281840	rungs and you know philosophers like George Ellis said that you only have causation uh between the
3281840	3287360	levels and uh Douglas Hofstadter and Gaudalesha Bark and The Strange Loop thinks that there's a
3287360	3294560	very complex panoply of causal pressures between the scales so like I gave the example to Michael
3294560	3300160	my mind is an emergent phenomenon and I command my hand to move and he said that at different
3300160	3304560	scales you get different amounts of work and actually I think if you get into integrated
3304560	3309360	information theory it's kind of talking to that a little bit and and I think you think of consciousness
3309360	3314240	as having a lot of um information processing going on because it's at the top of the stack to
3314240	3319920	to some extent but do you have any intuition on on how that information is kind of partitioned
3319920	3325920	between the scales and how those causal pressures work between the scale yes I do wonderful you're
3325920	3330880	very well read aren't you so it's nice that you you mentioned George Ellis I use the word top
3330880	3335120	down bottom causation exactly in the spirit that he writes about it so I had literally out here had
3335120	3340240	him in mind but so I was hoping if he ever hears it he'll know that I was talking about him so it's
3340240	3344800	exactly that and it always makes me a bit queasy when I use the word emergentism which I think
3345280	3350400	some people say there's no top down causation in emergentism but I I don't fully understand the
3350400	3355440	philosophy of it but it just acknowledged that sorry yes I've distracted myself from your really
3355440	3363920	important question which oh yes the um so the the different scales um of a Bayesian mechanic
3365840	3372800	self-organization viewed through the lens of Bayesian mechanics um I think um what we've just
3372800	3380720	been talking about and I would imagine with with Mike as well a lot of focus of here in that kind
3380720	3388320	of work um is um I hesitate to use it but I will use its spatial scales you know how how how to
3388320	3394800	element how the single cells assemble into multicellular why but you know how on earth can you
3395680	3402000	envisage the emergence of multicellular organisms as Mike's done some beautiful theoretical work
3402000	3408080	you know several years ago now just just think about it to be a skin cell to be an epithelium
3408080	3411920	means you have to sacrifice the ability to reproduce so it's if you like completely
3411920	3416000	paradoxical from the point of view of natural selection you have to sacrifice yourself with
3416000	3423440	the greater good so there are you know there's a wonderful questions about about um um cells of
3423440	3428960	cells and of cells and cells as you build up to different levels of um spatial scale but I think
3428960	3434320	your question will be better addressed from the point of view of temporal scales um and again you
3434320	3442000	come back to this um universalism um now I'm getting fluent using that word um where you've
3442000	3447280	got the same principle playing out yeah exactly the same principle exactly the same mechanics the
3447280	3455440	same Lagrangian um playing out at different scales that um where each scale contextualizes and has
3455440	3462160	this circular causality the bottom up and top down um um aspects to it in play so my favorite
3462160	3471280	example of this is just to um look at a succession of belief updating um processes um from the very
3471280	3477520	very fast which would be um from the point of view of um you know sentient machines it would
3477520	3481920	be inference inferring states of the world as they are in the moment so state estimation
3481920	3488080	Bayesian filtering um um everything that um you know speaks to some kind of situational
3488080	3495760	awareness on the basis of some smart and hopefully smartly sampled data um and then we move to the
3495760	3501120	next level I'm going to skip attention and precision but there is an intermediate level which
3501120	3507840	usually um in in the neurosciences has has a time scale of your your hundreds to just uh
3507840	3512080	of milliseconds to seconds but I'm going to I'm going to jump straight to learning
3512080	3518720	so what's learning well it's just slow inference it's just basically um slow belief updating um
3518720	3524640	where the states that matter now are equipped with another kind of label which we call parameters
3524640	3529680	or weights in machine learning in neural network but they're just random variables that are
3529680	3535760	brought to the table to explain uh or part of our world moral generative model but they're special
3536720	3542800	kinds of parameters because they change very very slowly and then you move well okay
3543520	3547600	so those are two levels what about turtles all the way down and turtles all the way up
3547600	3552560	well okay what's the next level well the next level is now the structure so now for any given
3552560	3558080	graph for example um that is equipped with edges and those edges will have to have some
3558880	3565840	slowly varying parameters um that describe the you know the nature of the message passing on
3565840	3573840	those edges um there will be um there will be a you know you are conditioning on upon a particular
3573840	3578800	structure and you know is there a connection there is it a hierarchical is it heterarchical is it
3578800	3584960	you know a unit is it um is it a transformer you know it's a convolutional you know you've seen
3584960	3592560	this wonderful evolution of structures in machine learning over the past few decades as people try
3592560	3597600	out different structures and you know some work for one kind of application of the work for others
3597600	3603760	but um from the point of view of your question what we are seeing is a kind of structure learning
3603760	3608720	that's playing out over years so this but it's exactly the same principle it's this free energy
3608720	3614720	minimization but just in this instance the free energy now is a pathological it's just the average
3614720	3622880	over a long period of time which is the um which is the exactly the quantity that people doing
3623760	3629440	structure learning or Bayesian model selection use when adjudicating between different graphs usually
3630480	3638480	of complex system models for example um you know and you could argue that now over
3639440	3644960	several tens of years or hundreds of years that you know exactly the same maths could be
3645760	3650400	leveraged to provide a formal description of natural selection as Bayesian model selection
3650400	3654720	exactly the same thing as you're doing now when you're selecting whether to speak or whether not
3654720	3660080	to speak or trying to infer you're selecting the right hypotheses about you know the narrative that
3660080	3666080	you have in your head that makes sense of what I'm saying um exactly the same maths and mechanics
3666080	3672000	is unfolding over the millennia um you know in terms of uh in terms in terms of evolution
3672000	3679120	so I think that's a nice example of the separation of temporal scales but the conservation of exactly
3679120	3685600	the same principles that have this information geometry and implicitly intelligence uh in of
3685600	3689440	a basal sort I use the word basal because that's what Mike Levin and Chris Fields and
3689440	3696320	Jim Place were at like using this it's this notion that um basal cognition and basal intelligence
3696320	3704640	transcends physics psychology and biology um it's all the same thing this is a line from
3704640	3711360	Chris Fields as a friend of Mike Levin yes yes and I think that's a great notion um and I think
3711360	3717280	you one can do that very gracefully by being a universalist and just by finding the right principle
3717840	3725200	the right sort of um reading of dynamics and you know that reading you know for me
3725200	3733280	is the information geometry that um that supports the belief updating I was going to do Markov
3733280	3739200	blankets later but it feels relevant now and maybe we should bring a bit of continuous versus
3739200	3743920	discreet in so a few things came to my mind when you were talking about that first of all we think
3743920	3750000	of um emergence over time and self-organization over space and I guess it just occurred to me
3750000	3754800	that are we only interested in time and space when we talk about this kind of structural learning
3754800	3762080	and then um with these Markov boundaries I had only thought of them um in at one point in time
3762080	3768240	but you could actually think of a kind of three-dimensional Markov boundary over time as well
3768240	3772960	now just to remind our audience um blanket states facilitate the interaction between
3772960	3778240	the internal and the external conditional independencies the external states are independent
3778240	3784240	from the um the internal states as long as we know the intermediate blanket states now um
3784240	3788640	to get to the uh to a core issue that we'd be modeling in complex systems you know like where
3788640	3799840	do you draw these boundaries and is it boundaries all the way down yes um so I think you're absolutely
3799840	3804240	right this is the perfect time to bring up this sort of uh I hadn't really thought about a notion
3804240	3810720	of boundaries in time and sort of um that's intriguing so but you're distracting me I well
3810720	3816720	I'll think about I'll think about that after our conversation and but no certainly so um there's
3816720	3823840	certainly a lot of current interest in um taking the notion of Markov blankets which is foundational
3823840	3828960	in this sort of reductionist lens of the free energy principle as a Bayesian mechanics um you know
3829680	3835120	the one could could summarize but the Bayesian mechanics of the free energy principle is simply
3835120	3841520	just another kind of uh quantum mechanics or statistical mechanics that inherits just from
3841520	3846960	this partition that is the Markov blanket that separates the the inside from the outside yes um
3846960	3851920	now um and of course there are lots of vexed issues about one how do you identify those Markov
3851920	3857680	blankets and how long do they endure for um so there's lots of interest in that at the moment
3858240	3865200	but one very simple approach to um um the question how long do they endure for is to say well that's
3865200	3869200	not the right question because we've just talked about separation of temporal scales
3869920	3877040	so you have to say at what temporal scale well you operationally define the Markov blanket
3877040	3883680	as the time over which it exists and what would that look like then when you certainly now think
3883680	3889360	about um this situating that temporal scale within the context of a larger temporal scale
3889360	3895520	so what you now have is a a picture where big Markov blankets blankets and blankets things
3895520	3904640	that define say you you and me or cultures or um um nation states or institutions that um out live
3904720	3913920	say species um these big ones are last for a long time but they contextualize and provide
3913920	3921440	constraints on uh Markov blankets at this at a smaller scale that last for very uh for much
3922240	3928640	much shorter periods of time and so on all the way down so that at some level say at the molecular
3928640	3934240	level from your perspective these Markov blankets may only exist for nanoseconds or your
3934240	3940880	milliseconds um but from the perspective of the molecule thank you you know this this is a lifetime
3940880	3947200	and it's well happy complying with or can be understood as um you know doing its own basal
3947200	3953200	intelligence do its own basal leaf updating just automatically for its lifetime which may only be
3953200	3958480	a few hundred milliseconds um you're making sense of its world or inter being interpreted as having
3958480	3963840	this sort of um sort of your biotic intelligence and self-organization just because it exists for
3963840	3971280	that period of time so then again this interesting question you know the how does one time frame
3971280	3977360	contextualize the other starts to bite and you know you start to now think about um from the
3977360	3986880	point of view of a slower time scale what would um a succession of Markov blankets uh look like um
3988560	3995040	and what one uh immediately encounters is the notion of a of a wandering eye tinder and Markov
3995040	4001680	blanket yes um we spoke about vagueness on on the first one so we'll we'll park that but the
4001680	4007280	wandering sets is very very interesting but um I there were two things that I that I think I wanted
4007280	4013280	to understand um you do think that there's a hierarchy of blankets but I'm interested in
4013280	4017440	exploring this idea of whether the blankets could be observer relative because you used the word
4017840	4022640	understood as a Markov blanket and that brings up two things to the core of my mind first of all
4022640	4028400	the extent to which they are a lens versus describing something in reality I see and if they
4028400	4032640	do describe something in reality you spoke about this symmetric causal pressures which we can we
4032640	4037760	can speak to as well but but on this understood thing it's very similar to um Wittgenstein said
4037760	4043440	the meaning of a word is in its use and that meaning in language is is embedded in pragmatic
4043520	4048240	actions and the language game and so on and and then like the the further forward occurs well
4048240	4055920	maybe the the understanding of a boundary or a you know Markov boundary blanket could be um
4055920	4064160	understood in the context of one's perspective right that's a great question and um and I
4064880	4071040	it may be informed by reading some of the philosophical literature and I should remind
4071040	4077200	you of course I am not a philosopher so um so what I say will be naive um you need to speak to
4077200	4084800	philosophers about this but I would I would say the Markov blanket um is is something which is
4084800	4092880	metaphysical um you know it it is defined by a particular spastic structure when formulating
4093440	4099920	any state space in terms of dynamics and specifically you know a long fan equation
4099920	4105920	so one talks about the free energy principle as a first principle account um but it does
4105920	4111520	actually commit to something it commits to the notion that there are states and that those
4111520	4117920	states have a separation of temporal scales that disambiguates or separates systemic states
4117920	4124160	from random fluctuations so but that's all it does there are no more assumptions and then
4124160	4130160	everything else follows from that under the understanding that for sufficiently large systems
4130720	4138720	the probability of there not being a Markov blanket is um um zero um so when this comes back
4138720	4148160	to the sort of um this sparse coupling conjecture um that Christopher I think was alluding to um or
4148240	4156000	at least we um we unpacked in terms of your if a system comes to uh exists of and it's
4156000	4161280	sufficiently big it will be sparse and once it spars there um with probability one will be
4161280	4166320	Markov blankets so at no point now have we introduced the notion of observers we haven't
4166320	4171120	at this point even introduced the notion of the free energy principle we're just saying um there
4171120	4176640	will be one way of carving up large dynamical systems or certainly systems can be expressed
4176640	4183360	as a large van equation or a random dynamical system um um will be ways of carving them up
4183360	4190080	into one or more Markov blankets at one or more scales yes um and then the question is well what
4190960	4197760	what would it what what would one uh how would one then describe um the dynamics
4198480	4205040	for any given Markov blanket so you at this point you are at liberty if you are simulating
4205040	4210480	a universe to choose the Markov blanket and the scale that you want to simulate if you're part
4210480	4216000	of this system you're not at liberty because if you're part of this system you have your Markov
4216000	4222720	blanket so all you see are the sensory impressions upon your Markov blanket and you may or may not
4222720	4226880	have active states and it brings us back to the other bright lines that make between agents and
4226880	4235280	sense-making machines that can't act sessile things um so if you're asking um I am I um
4236160	4242400	are the observer dependent perspective dependent aspects of um this formulation
4243600	4252480	using Markov blankets as a um a physiological device not if you're part of the system it says
4252480	4257120	something quite profound about what you could you know what you know what and if you're being
4257120	4263040	observed by something else if you believe if your world model is populated with the fantasy that
4263040	4271120	there are other observers out there yes um then um those observers will never ever know your internal
4271120	4278400	states well what about rather than an observer um an actor or an agent and we'll talk about
4278400	4282560	an activism in a little bit but even at the microscopic scale there are still affordances
4282560	4288480	and you gave this beautiful example of um of a type of species where someone might kill themselves
4288480	4292400	with a great good and that that shows the kind of information sharing that you have in in these
4292400	4299120	complex systems so similarly if I'm an agent in this system and and I act and and there are these
4299120	4303120	you've described this cybernetic loop and there are these kind of symmetrical causal pressures and
4303120	4308880	so on and and and then you almost get this emergence of the Markov blanket so it's so it's
4308880	4316320	changeable yes no it certainly um that's only true um it is changeable and it's malleable and
4316320	4320400	it's self-assembling uh and certainly when you have Markov blankets and Markov blankets and
4320400	4324320	coalitions of Markov blankets for example of formation of in-groups and out-groups and the
4324320	4331280	like yes you would expect there to be a a you know a dynamics of of the Markov blankets or
4331280	4337040	who you're relating to so you know the sparsity uh structure and who I talk to and who I listen to
4337040	4344640	and you know what social media uh you know I commit to all of these things are um products of or
4344640	4350960	reflections and can all be articulated in terms of you know wandering Markov blankets that's
4350960	4360000	absolutely true um I I thought you were you were asking um something more about um whether the
4360000	4367360	Markov blanket is part of a realist metaphysical description or whether it's uh you know I mean
4367360	4374080	there is another argument if you if you now play god and you now put your universe in in a computer
4374080	4379040	and now to simulate and write papers about your simulated universe where you can see
4379040	4384080	the the internal states next to all states then you know I think you're in a different world um
4385040	4391200	just I get I repeat that's something quite profound about the questions of you know what
4391200	4398080	is it like to be something um are interesting because from the point of view of the free energy
4398080	4402800	principle what is it like to be something means that someone's asking that question so they are a
4402800	4408880	thing and they're asking about another thing so now they're asking questions what is it what are
4409440	4416720	is it like to um know the internal states of a Markov blanket but by definition you can never
4416720	4422320	know them so there is something impenetrable about being something else so it's a question
4422320	4430800	which is unanswerable it's unknowable um um so if um from that point of view I think there's something
4430880	4438560	beyond the um the sort of the epistemology of you know um of Markov blankets but if you're just
4438560	4443920	simulating cells or people or you know doing multi-agent simulations then obviously you can
4443920	4450480	you can choose where to put your blankets and you can you can just use them as a device to um
4450480	4456160	to understand self-organization to simulate it and to predict it and I think in that instance
4456160	4462400	you know that you you could deploy your Markov blankets wherever you wanted to at every any
4462400	4468000	scale you you you thought was interesting for the phenomena of interest that's not quite speaking
4468000	4472400	to what you're into though which is a changeability of the the Markov blankets or well I mean we
4472400	4477280	can get into that um because if uh and later on we'll talk about the the real world implementations
4477280	4484080	of these ideas but um but if you if you did hard code the the Markov blankets then you
4484080	4488400	would bottleneck the system essentially so ideally you you would actually have the system
4488400	4494320	to find a sufficient resolution where all of this could could emerge um itself yeah did did you cover
4494320	4502160	the point of whether the blankets can be um must they be spatially temporally you know should they
4502160	4508400	have a spatial temporal contiguity and the reason I'm asking that question is when you think of a
4508400	4514240	blanket I like almost synonymizing it with an organism and maybe that's a bad thing to do and
4514240	4520400	you can correct me but but if we think of um the discontinuous blankets in information geometry
4520400	4526400	that's an interesting idea because we kind of visualize them in 3d space don't you yeah yeah
4526400	4532000	yeah well certainly they'll have a topology yeah um I mean I've noticed earlier on you're talking
4532000	4536160	about sort of play cells and grid cells which are you know very special and beautiful constructs
4536160	4542640	which speak to a certain continuity or contiguity aspect yes they they suggest that these um you're
4543280	4550880	coming back to uh Christopher some of um Summerfield's um book um you know one way of understanding
4550880	4556480	the um the Markov blankets in the brain so you know we've been talking about Markov blankets
4556480	4562160	delineating me from a world but of course um your temporal lobe has a Markov blanket as it
4562160	4566640	wouldn't be a thing you wouldn't be able to call it a temporal lobe so you know the very hierarchy
4566640	4573120	could also be described now in terms of um Markov blankets within Markov blankets within Markov
4573120	4576880	blankets and some really interesting questions about what that means for what what part of the
4576880	4581120	brain can know about another part of the brain and what and what action becomes of course it becomes
4581120	4585520	a tension yeah I just wanted to slip that in because I think that was in part what you were
4585520	4592800	driving at with this sort of context sensitive fluid dynamics on in exchanges between Markov
4592800	4598320	blankets I think it's incredibly important even within the brain in neuroscience this is basically
4598320	4603440	the the routing of information the deployment of selective attention or sensory attenuation
4603440	4609360	attenuating ignoring some signals it is exactly that that makes us such adaptive context sensitive
4609360	4614720	information processing um machines and of course that is exactly what you'd have to worry about
4614720	4621280	when designing a web with routing and and context sensitive you know who do I listen to uh so you
4621280	4631920	you know this is really really important um the um so the the the emergence of um I think
4633840	4639600	you're absolutely right they will have a topology and if I were using Markov blankets and you know
4639600	4646400	I do and many other people do every day when um thinking about message passing as a statistician
4646400	4654800	on factor graphs or um which are due to a graphical model a probabilistic graphical model of the
4654800	4662880	system you're trying to estimate or understand um then you know the Markov blanket is just the um
4662880	4667920	you know the implicit notes that that are the influence of me or the or the parents of children
4667920	4672240	the parents of the children you know and that has enormous implications for minimizing the
4672240	4677920	complexity of the message passing um and you know and I repeat defines a hierarchy for example
4679600	4687200	so Markov blankets there will have a topology um probably best understood practically from the
4687200	4695760	point of view of graph theory as opposed to um information geometry um but there are special
4695840	4704160	kinds of connectivity that you see um such as place fields and I'd also say if you just look
4704160	4710640	at the history of machine learning there are particular um kinds of Markov blankets that
4710640	4714560	characterize the very structure of certain neural networks I'm thinking here convolutional neural
4714560	4719840	networks I'm thinking about you're often motivated through weight sharing and the like but you know
4719840	4723520	if you look at weight sharing as just the kind of structural learning that's trying to minimize the
4723600	4733120	complexity part of your free energy or your um negative um log marginal likelihood um then what
4733120	4737600	you are doing is finding the right kind of spastic fit for explaining these kinds of data
4738560	4743840	what uh what what what is the architectural principle it's it's the translational invariance
4743840	4749600	the translational symmetry it's just the contiguity aspect it's a fact that you are sampling data
4749680	4756080	that is generated in or from a metric space that has a well-behaved metric so I would I would say
4756080	4761040	that sort of you know place cells and grid cells and many in and many other are thinking about
4761040	4767520	Chris's friend Tim Behren's work for example um finding grid light structures everywhere
4767520	4774000	in abstract spaces uh so what that tells you is that that it's likely that we live in a world
4774800	4784880	um where data are caused by samples from a metric space that has a you know a measure to it um not
4784880	4790880	all spaces do um I think it'd be you'd be hard pushed to find you know the right kind of metric
4790880	4796160	for language for example um and certainly if you're if you're if you're sort of building
4796160	4801200	message-passing schemes or believe propagation schemes on a factor graph you don't you don't
4801200	4806640	think about contiguity in a metric sense you know you don't measure the distance between one node
4806640	4812400	another node it's is it connected or not um so I think there are some special um contiguity
4813120	4819840	there are some special worlds that are recapitulated that emerge in the internal architectures of
4819840	4826880	intelligent machines that have this contiguity property in virtue of the fact that some aspects
4826880	4834240	of the causes of the sensorium are elaborated in a metric space but not necessarily everywhere
4834880	4840560	and yeah well I want to take you back I know you for you I want to where you want to take me
4840560	4849120	anyway well I will I will finish then because um I see uh in the brain and I also see in the
4849120	4856560	direction of travel in terms of um building thinking machines um as you get deeper into
4856560	4865120	these hierarchies and you go from a fine scale to larger scale there is an interesting move between
4865120	4872960	um um architectures that would speak to this metric aspect in space and in time
4873840	4880880	to a more discretized topological non-metric representation yes I know I wanted to touch
4880880	4885200	on that I mean there's a beautiful example I mean Christopher Summerfield talks about
4885200	4891440	Pierce's triad and various ways that we learn different types of um symbol and abstractions
4891440	4895440	and so on and there is a famous experiment in neuroscience I'm sure you're familiar with it
4895440	4901360	where they showed people pictures in a certain order and associations and then the same topological
4901360	4907360	structure was was recovered I think in the NTL and and this is because even though with spatial
4907360	4911840	temporal contiguity there is a metric space but the brain learns these kind of associations and
4911840	4916400	then you can essentially learn these abstract concepts that you know concepts that reverberate
4916400	4921920	in our language and experience they get represented yes and I completely agree with your um point
4921920	4928160	about the the revolutionary idea of the um the translational local um equivalence you know the
4928160	4935120	the way it's sharing with CNNs it's a beautiful idea it's revolutionized deep learning so um
4935120	4939280	just to finish off the discussion on Markov blankets I wanted to talk about part-hole
4939280	4946240	relationships so um for the benefit of the audience in logic and philosophy myriology
4946240	4953040	is the study of parts and holes that they form whereas in set theory it's founded on the membership
4953040	4960720	relation between a set and its elements and myriology emphasizes the relation between entities
4960720	4965440	which is to say the inclusion between them so anyway when considering systems Markov blankets
4965440	4971440	can nest into hierarchies and what connection if any is there you know between that in the
4971440	4977200	philosophical study of myriology and um I was also going to bring in I don't know if you've
4977200	4983760	heard of Hinton's glom architecture but it it it was it came after capsule networks and it's
4983760	4988000	you know we were just talking about these wonderful inductive priors in deep learning and they
4988800	4993280	they make the problem there are many curses in machine learning but one of them is kind of like
4993280	4999360	the curse of optimization and um and there's a complexity curse as well and that's why most
4999360	5004880	of these inductive priors they reduce the size of the hypothesis set if you reduce it too much
5004960	5008560	you get approximation error which doesn't help you either there's curses everywhere but um
5008560	5011760	but this is a really interesting prior as well these part whole relationship
5012880	5018880	gosh yes there's so many issues you bring that I'll just reiterate my favorite one which is the
5018880	5025040	you know the the notion of um these inductive biases minimizing the complexity I think that's
5025040	5029600	absolute you know that's something which is absolutely central um from the physicist's
5029600	5038400	perspective you know this um reading um self organization as self evidencing which is a
5038400	5045600	philosophically poetic way of simply um describing existence as an optimization process which you
5045600	5051040	shouldn't really do it's all it's really a principle of least action but you can read it as an optimization
5051040	5057840	process what are you optimizing the evidence for my world models what how can I carve up that evidence
5057840	5063520	complexity and accuracy what does having a what would I then mean by optimization what I mean
5063520	5070480	just providing the simplest account that maintains a degree of accuracy what do I mean by simplest
5070480	5077600	minimizing the degrees of freedom that I use up in providing that accurate account how do I do that
5077600	5082320	by the right spastic structure what does that mean it just means finding the right structure
5082320	5088080	and you know you could actually think of much of evolution and um the trajectory of machine
5088080	5093920	learning architectures as this game of finding the right structure but there are just these structural
5093920	5100640	priors that are apt for describing the kind of data you know so if you're you've spent your
5100640	5106240	entire life doing emnist images then it's going to be the kind of structural priors that they are
5106240	5110800	that's that inherit from being sampled from a metric space and you'll have all the convolution
5110800	5116960	I think the capsule I didn't I didn't know about the glom stuff I was like listening to Jeff's
5118480	5123600	latest ideas because he's always got the right kind of intuitions and and these intuitions are
5123600	5131840	part of the I think part of our reflection of ashby's law of requisite varieties explored in
5131840	5140480	hypothesis space about the very structures but certainly the the capsule stuff and the you know
5140480	5148080	the one aspect of structures of graphical models or implicit factor graphs when it comes to
5148080	5155520	implementation which I think is often neglected is the orthogonal direction from the orthogonal
5155520	5161680	aspect you know in relation to hierarchical composition and that's the sort of the breadth
5161680	5168000	of a model in terms of having factors that can be separated so if you wanted to have
5168080	5174640	say scene construction you wanted to have multi-object you're the ability to track and infer
5174640	5181360	and and make sense of data generated by multiple objects what are you saying well there are multiple
5181360	5187680	things out there and these things again from the point of view of first principle account
5187680	5193280	have certain conditional independences that is literally revealed by a lack of connections
5193280	5197680	in your world model what would that look like well if you're a physicist it would just be a
5197680	5203920	mean field approximation literally factorizing introducing conditional independences and factorizing
5203920	5209920	a massive joint distribution at any one level in your hierarchical model into a number of factors
5209920	5215600	that if you're a neurobiologist would now be functional specialization and modularity of a
5215600	5223120	fedorian sense you know what aware in the brain would be the the the conical examples so I looked
5223280	5230880	at that as as a move towards paying more careful attention to the non convolutional aspect you
5230880	5238720	know those things that that actually deny a translational symmetry and actually celebrate
5238720	5242960	the conditional independences within any one particular within any one particular scale
5242960	5248720	so my guess is and I have no idea so I'm talking from a point of view of complete ignorance but
5248720	5254800	my guess is that if it's an extension of capsule networks then it will have that aspect it'll have
5254800	5262240	that separability that sort of things that can do stuff and account for attributes that are independent
5262240	5269600	from other attributes or other objects that are that are conspiring to generate the data and certainly
5269600	5278400	my world of toy prototypes generative models usually in matlab you know then all the heavy
5278400	5283840	lifting is done from the the mapping between the levels again so all the interactions you know
5283840	5289120	big red buses there's bigness as redness as busness these can be factorized but they all
5289120	5296080	have to conspire literally through interactions and highly non-linear operators
5297040	5305360	and then generating what I would see if there was a big red bus so you know that puts a lot of pressure
5305360	5312320	on the the likelihood tensors or the mapping from you know you'll say a sense an input layer to the
5312320	5317920	the first hidden layer for example and then sort of leads you into all sorts of interesting issues
5317920	5324320	about you know how do you accommodate that non linearity and do you again as looking at the
5324320	5331760	evolution of machine learning architectures as an evolutionary process you know at relu or you know
5331760	5337840	tannate whatever you know that is another aspect of this sort of structural learning I think we'll
5337840	5343600	be very much finessed I think if we just move to sort of quantum operators and just go to discrete
5343600	5348560	state spaces in the in the spirit of quantum loop gravity I think sort that out and then we can worry
5348560	5353760	about what particularly non linearities I've wondered away what was it what was your question my
5353760	5359200	point well no this this is a wonderful breakpoint so um before we hit record we were talking a little
5359200	5363680	bit about chat gbt and just before we go there because that's a fun discussion I think one of the
5363680	5367680	things that really distinguishes your your line of thinking me obviously there's the uncertainty
5367680	5372480	quantification someone but um also there's this idea of an activism and I wanted to just do a
5372480	5378400	whistle stop tour of that as a contrast to these more monolithic approaches to AI like like chat
5378400	5385520	gbt so um an activism contrasts with representationalism which is this idea that I you know I know
5385520	5391760	everything about the world inside the model and um you said that you can't just think of the brain
5391760	5398080	as some behaviorist thing it's a dance of dialogue you act in the environment and the environment acts
5398080	5403120	on you in a cybernetic loop now you also gave the I'm quoting like an interview that you did
5403120	5409840	previously you gave the example of radical an activism that you can dispense of representationalism
5409840	5416000	entirely and you gave this beautiful example of this walking robot that kind of fell down a hill
5416000	5423040	and it did so so gracefully it looked like it was walking it was all in the body um you know if the
5423040	5427920	body is sufficiently tuned to the environment you don't even need cognition and of course we'll
5427920	5433600	talk about the decomposition of cognition in a minute um and and you bring in this idea of
5433600	5440320	circular causality uh so we're causally embedded in the world by directionally essentially now
5440320	5447120	when we decompose cognition um I think of things like thinking and feeling and knowing and acting
5447120	5451600	and and the environment and and so on and I think this is one of the key things that distinguishes
5451600	5455840	your your line of thought so could you give us a bit of a whistle stop tour of an activism
5456720	5465840	yeah so um an activism is at the heart of the circuit causality that that that um follows from
5465840	5471920	the very existence of a Markov blanket um and a Markov blanket is the thing that would be it's
5471920	5477280	certainly in my world necessary for the existence of something that is demarcated or individuated
5477280	5484480	from something else so just having a separation between thing and nothing or not thing um
5485200	5492080	having uh that separation requires you now to think about the two-way traffic um the bi-directional
5492080	5499040	traffic and of course now you've got two directions of travel that can be thought of as um the agent
5499040	5506240	if you like sensing the environment um on the one hand and on the other hand the agent acting
5506240	5512400	upon the environment or vice versa um you've got now a circular causality so coming back to sort of
5512400	5518960	your the the the the notion of a perception action cycle and this notion of a dancing and a
5518960	5525680	a derdic exchange which is bi-directional two-way traffic between the two so when you apply the
5525680	5532240	free energy principle in practice to um emulate or simulate sentient behavior behavior that is
5532240	5539120	predicated on sense making um then you are necessarily simulating action perception cycles
5539120	5544320	so you're necessarily inactivist and that's called active inference so sometimes just for fun i put
5544320	5549600	an en in front of it called an active inference i have to say the active inference was really a
5549600	5558240	nod to active learning it was just it's same idea but um but cast in terms of fast belief updating
5558240	5565840	as opposed to sort of slow evidence accumulation in terms of learning contingencies um so that use
5565840	5571680	of inactive is at the heart of applications of the free energy principle and obviously
5571680	5577120	has been at the heart of i think all right-minded formulations of behavior and self-organization
5577120	5583280	since Plato probably but certainly you know things like perceptual control theories cybernetics and
5583280	5591280	all of that good stuff everybody at some point active sensing um well you know what will will
5592240	5598560	have to commit to this um active aspect um even to a certain extent semiotics i think well
5598560	5606160	no perhaps we shouldn't gather um but the so that would be one way of um sort of celebrating and
5606160	5614320	foregrounding the role of action um and what would that look like from the point of view of
5614320	5620400	machine learning and computer science well it would look like basically smart data mining
5621360	5629520	and it would change the nature of the game from um big data making sense of big data so having
5629520	5636400	everything on the inside having access to the entire world um and then making sense of that and
5636400	5639680	you know you may ask what does that mean by making sense of it well it's certainly doing
5639680	5648400	something with it like generative AI versus um the the the complementary approach which is much
5648480	5653360	more in line with this sort of complexity minimization the imperatives for the sustainable
5653360	5661040	self-organizing self-assembling systems versus smart data um so the job the action now is
5661040	5667120	this basically what moves do i make on the world to get the right kind of data that will serve my
5667120	5671600	imperatives what are my imperatives to maximize the evidence from my model of the world and if
5671600	5678960	i can do that by definition my um i will be there or put it other way around if i you know if i exist
5678960	5684720	then that is what it looks like i am doing so you know you talk about the or you mentioned this notion
5684720	5692720	sort of monolithic big systems um versus small agile intelligent little agents that go and get
5692720	5699920	the smart data that they need or that they think that you need that is exactly um the sort of picture
5700640	5706720	that underwrites this notion of distributed cognition and that a different kind of network
5706720	5714080	and a different way of relating to intelligent artifacts and information services and um and
5714080	5721120	apps uh where it's lots of really small smart things who are actively getting the right kind
5721120	5727600	of data that they need to um resolve uncertainty about the context in which they find themselves
5727600	5732000	again that you know the complexity minimization gets in and the things are very i'm sure we've
5732000	5737600	talked about this before but i can't resist just um mentioning it again from the point of view of
5737600	5743520	sustainability and climate change you know the direction of travel of these large um say large
5743520	5749680	language models for example is it's so wrong uh wrong from the point of view of the ideology of
5749680	5754240	climate change but also wrong from the point of view of landowners principle and the jeniski
5754240	5762320	equality when read as a thermodynamic corollary of self-organization and non-equilibrium you know
5762320	5770080	you've got to minimize the complexity minimize um all of the internal machinations so that you
5770080	5776400	you just need the minimal amount of data um expertly handled every little agents and good
5776400	5781440	scientists designing the right experiments and get the smart data that resolves uncertainty about
5781440	5787840	what it doesn't know uh the job done if you if you can do it like that so that would be one um if
5787840	5794560	you like sort of answer to your question your um the implications and the importance of inactivism
5794560	5801600	used really just as a euphemism for an agent that can gather its own data the radical inactivism is
5801600	5806000	i think a more of a philosophical thing and it's more of a fun argument and i don't know any radical
5806000	5812800	inactivist so i you know i i don't i don't have um i don't have the right sensibilities uh to
5812800	5820240	just really answer this question but it's for what i understand um they you know they they have um
5821600	5828720	taken it a little bit too far and uh denying representationalism um uh to the extent that
5828720	5837600	you know the you can get a kind of um sense making that doesn't actually involve any internal
5837600	5845360	dynamics um and um you know i'm sure that's true and i'm sure that you're going to sell um uh chat
5845360	5854400	cheat uh gtp to me as well as one one example of this mindless kind of uh sort of you're inacted
5854400	5861760	um sense making um it's the opposite i think um i would call chat gbt extreme representationalism
5861760	5868080	all right yes we'll resist the urge that we'll go there immediately after this i i promise but
5868080	5875520	um so clearly we we think that intelligence does necessitate embodiment i think that's clear but
5875520	5882080	i want to just explore this continuum between um inactivism and representationalism um
5882080	5890880	um this is this is really interesting so um this comes down to grounding to a certain extent so
5890880	5897840	cognition must be grounded in different domains in in the physical world possibly in language in
5897840	5904560	acting in affordances in knowledge as well and so this this is a view that that it that it is
5904560	5913120	grounded let's say in in affordances but if these agents these organisms ground their cognition
5913120	5919920	in affordances then to what extent could you say they are learning a world model if that model is
5919920	5930480	with the lens of an affordance i think i think you can sort of do this um reconcile um very rich
5930480	5940240	representationalism um in the service of inactivism simply by noting that um in the circular exchange
5940240	5945520	you have to deploy the right kinds of actions and that's going to require um coming back to
5945520	5948960	what we're talking about before in terms of planning yeah being able to build the right
5948960	5956320	counterfactuals no and to do to do that in an expert way in an intelligent way you need to
5956320	5961440	be able to represent the causal contingencies and states affairs in the world at this time
5961440	5967200	upon which you're predicating your next action so i i'm now just thinking you know
5967200	5973600	just looking at your your expressions and i now realize that you that you were trying to sell
5973600	5979520	a dialectic between uh inactivism and representationalism for me um they are the same thing
5980080	5984240	you to be a good inactivist you have to have the right representations if you want to
5984240	5991040	to well may i say good i mean um good at a particular scale the big things that survive
5991040	5996560	so viruses don't need to do much planning um but things like you and me do need to do a lot
5996560	6001200	quite a lot of planning so as you move up those scales you have to look further into the future
6001200	6007600	so that we certainly need representations which is what i have which um which is why i'll smile
6007600	6013520	always smile what i think about radical inactivism um so if there's no space in radical inactivism
6013520	6020720	for being able to plan to imagine scenarios to have narratives that play out on the inside before
6020720	6026160	committing and selecting the right way forward yeah and it's not an apt description of certainly
6026160	6035120	cognition okay it's so interesting because the question to me is we just spoke about this idea
6035120	6041680	of planning potentially through an information geometry and many of the abstractions that humans
6041680	6048560	learn are not grounded in the physical world at all and that's very interesting and we can get to
6048560	6054720	how those abstractions are learned but i guess what i'm saying is let's say one of these agents in
6054720	6062240	this multi-agent system it's traversing this topology what grounds the states in that topology
6063120	6070080	well i think that that would be um ultimately it will be the transactions um you know with
6070160	6075920	with the world the underwrite um at the lowest hierarchal level all the generative models of
6075920	6082160	this hierarchal sorts of the abstractions are just the coarse-graining simplifications that you know
6082160	6089440	the the um the products of literally looking at the lower levels of your hierarchy through a
6089440	6095120	reductionist lens in the right kind of way that enable you to carve up the world in terms of these
6095840	6102400	in terms of these abstractions which may live in a non-metric space they may still have this
6102400	6108160	ordinal structure you were referring to before and then what that would mean in the context of
6108800	6115040	lots of similar artifacts who had done the right kind of coarse-graining would be now
6115040	6122160	the opportunity for direct belief sharing your brain-to-brain communication speaking to a friend
6122160	6128240	of mine you heard yesterday talking about the distinction between communicating through um
6129760	6138000	the through sensory um um exchanges such as language but what we're actually doing is basically
6138000	6144240	directly exchanging beliefs um of course you could do that directly um in silico you could
6144240	6151360	actually have messages about what this agent believes at this abstract level of um of representation
6151360	6157040	very high in a you know hierarchal graphical model it could pass its sufficient statistics to
6157040	6163520	another partner somewhere else in the world um elsewhere on that on that graph so you do have
6163520	6169920	the opportunity now for direct belief sharing um and um there are all sorts of interesting questions
6169920	6175200	about you know how you'd engineer that you know you can't coming back to this fact you have to
6175200	6180320	have sparsely in the game you have to decide where to to send and receive your beliefs from
6180320	6184640	then we have this sort of attention and routing problem and then you have do you have peer-to-peer
6184640	6190080	communication do you go through a server can you write that down in terms of um quantum
6190080	6195200	information theories a holographic screen and who's you know having all sorts of really interesting
6195200	6201120	things but what they speak to is that you're now you're sharing beliefs literally basing beliefs
6201120	6207680	probability distributions as encoded by sufficient statistics that can be passed um as messages uh
6207760	6215760	on a on a factor graph um you're now talking about the ability for proper communication
6215760	6222640	of the kind that has evolved in terms of cultural niche construction and evolutionary psychology
6222640	6228880	that speaks to cultural niche construction uh that we enjoy in terms of you know the words
6228880	6236000	that we use and the and the exchanges that we use yes yes indeed there are two things to bring in
6236000	6242480	so knowledge and language and you did invoke Andy Clark in another interview which is the
6242480	6249680	extended theory of mind so it's one of the five ease in cognitive science and the the communication
6249680	6255360	substrate could of course it's it's distributed so the two agents could be referring on missing
6255360	6260560	information that actually exists perhaps in another agent or another another knowledge repository
6260560	6265680	and then we can also talk to exactly what the role of language is and how it's compressed how it
6265680	6270800	represents abstract concepts and so on um so i'm very interested in knowledge and language i'm not
6270800	6276480	sure if you could bring those in right um i'm not sure i can do so expertly but certainly
6276480	6283520	part of learning new things since my foray into into industry is this notion of knowledge graphs so
6283520	6292480	if you know if you read a probabilistic graphical model as um at least its structure as being a
6292480	6298400	knowledge graph then embodied um in the structure and presumably the parameters of the connections
6298400	6305200	that constitute that graphical model that would be knowledge so for me um in a very non-mysterious
6305200	6312960	and possibly too simple minded a way knowledge is just the product of um belief updating of a
6312960	6322000	slow kind which is learning so i know contingencies um in the sense that i have um a suitably configured
6322080	6329600	optimized structure and parametrically weighted um generative model that can be written down as a
6329600	6335280	knowledge graph or a graphical model um upon which i do my message passing to do my inference about
6335280	6342240	the particular context sensitive in the moment kind of thing so i would put knowledge um basically
6342240	6352240	as an attribute uh that is implicit in a um a graphical description of um uh an implicit
6352240	6359280	generative model or world model that is um actively um that is used actively to do the
6359280	6365680	data mining to do the you know do the inference and uh and the sense making and then the language
6365680	6375520	part of it um would just be that um highest level most coarse grained summary that is conserved over
6375520	6386320	multiple agents so just by definition um if i want to do belief sharing um i have to um i have to
6386320	6392800	have a a shared generative model or a commitment to the same narrative so that the meaning of
6392800	6398800	what i'm emitting is received in the right spirit or the right frame of reference by you
6399440	6404640	and indeed um there's some lovely rhetoric from quantum information theory of the kind
6404640	6409120	that Chris Fields and Jim Glacebrook have been pursuing where you literally have to
6410000	6416400	think about the generative model as a quantum frame of reference and we have to share that in
6416400	6423360	order to communicate so in this instance the um the Markov blanket ceases to be just a set of states
6423360	6431040	and see and and adopts the role of a holographic screen and action now is writing to that screen
6431040	6437520	and sensation is now reading from that screen and there are two agents on either side so you know
6437520	6442160	whatever is written is an action but can be read by something else and then you're looking at the
6442160	6448080	entanglement which is the the synchrony of mutual understanding that you know we would aspire to
6448880	6457120	through through through communication so that that that um but that only works if if the messages
6457120	6463840	that are written to the screen or written to the Markov blanket um um have the same kind of
6463840	6470000	interpretation so it speaks again to this um the the fact that you have to have a good model of the
6470000	6479280	world and the world has um and that really means that there's a kind of entanglement or
6479280	6483360	generalized synchrony from the point of view of dynamical system theory between the two sides of
6483360	6492480	your screen or the two sides of your Markov blanket or your server um um which have you know the right
6492480	6498560	kind of isomorphism so we're talking about you know basically a shared narrative that underwrites
6498560	6504080	any exchange of signals and again what you know just thinking of of this from the point of view
6506160	6512480	of generalized synchrony what we are talking about is just the characteristic
6513360	6519680	or the emergence of characteristic behaviors in any sparsely coupled set or ensemble of
6519680	6527760	things that possess Markov blankets or have a separability um um uh what will they ultimately
6527760	6534160	do they'll ultimately find a synchronization manifold they'll find uh a synchronization
6534800	6541520	simply because um this is the um the most likely state of being and the most likely
6541520	6544960	state of being is that which maximizes the marginal likelihood which minimizes the free
6544960	6550160	energy which just means that they now understand and can infer each other so you know it's just
6550160	6556640	another expression of this existential imperative to resolve uncertainty have good models of my world
6556720	6561040	and my world also needs to have good models of me and if my world is you you have to have
6561040	6565040	a good model of me and I have to have a good model of you ultimately what that means is
6565040	6570160	we're going to converge on the same model um yeah I mean what interests me there is that
6570160	6576560	unlike many other researchers you're conflating understanding you know knowing and intelligence
6576560	6584560	itself I guess I guess so yeah um so good question um if intelligence is a process of belief
6584560	6592240	updating then yes it's just intelligence and learning and just learning knowledge and intelligently
6592240	6596000	inferring states of affairs are just the same process at different time scales and they both
6596000	6602320	depend upon each other so I have to have the right neural network of the right weights and the right
6602320	6608800	learning to make sense of the data in the moment and if you think of it from the point of view of
6609760	6615440	weight learning um either through propagation of errors or through experience dependent or
6615440	6619920	spike timing plasticity in the brain you have to have the right inference in order to do the
6619920	6624880	learning so there's again this circular causality between between the two scales so knowledge
6624880	6629920	requires the right inference or state estimation and state estimation requires the right knowledge
6629920	6635280	to make sense of the data that's being assimilated yes although I suppose philosophically we could
6635360	6639600	break it down because you know knowledge might be the sort of the information acquisition
6640160	6644400	because knowledge exists it's quite an interesting philosophical point actually that
6644400	6650960	knowledge is on Wikipedia and it's crystallized knowledge it exists as a thing but the ability
6650960	6657360	to to acquire knowledge without surprise is is is your your form of intelligence but I wanted to
6657360	6664240	talk about chat gpt just quickly and it's very interesting because Bing have just released
6664240	6672240	a new version of their search engine which integrates chat gpt and I've I've been on a bit of a journey
6672240	6679680	when they released gpt 3 in the it was November 2020 I got access to it I thought it was garbage
6679680	6684720	it was just generating a load of rubbish basically but there were people out there who were true
6684720	6690320	believers and they said Tim you're not seeing it I you know I I've seen it and they would show me
6690320	6696160	these ridiculous examples and I just thought no you're just fooled by randomness and and then
6696160	6702240	DaVinci 2 came out about a year ago and then that that transgressed the anthropomorphic
6702240	6707200	fooled by randomness threshold so I started to be a bit of a believer I knew it didn't understand
6707200	6712000	anything but it started to get very useful and I was using it for coding and generating emails and so
6712000	6718400	on much much to my loss actually because recently I've been checking code into the to the repo and
6718400	6723200	my colleagues have been saying to me Tim it looks like you used gpt to generate that why is it full
6723200	6728560	of holes and you have to hold your hand up and oh yes I'm sorry I just I just checked in some code
6728560	6734960	that I clearly didn't understand and you know didn't actually save me any time so sometimes you can
6734960	6741760	see problems with its generation but it's so plausible that most of the time they're hidden
6741760	6746000	and unfortunately if you want to verify that knowledge you might as well have just not bothered
6746000	6751360	using gpt in the first place because you could have just gone so a little recap it's using a
6751360	6756480	self-attention decoder transformer and that's a neural network architecture that introduces
6757200	6762960	permutation invariance to tuple permutation invariance which turns out to be extremely
6762960	6768960	useful for language and then there was this discovery of what's called in context learning
6769600	6774080	which is where rather than just getting it to because it's a generative model it just generates
6774080	6781120	token token you you insert a prompt and then continue to generate from that prompt and people
6781120	6787520	discovered you could ask it questions it had this emergent reasoning capability in big air quotes
6787520	6791840	and then more recently people have done what's called preference fine tuning which is that you
6791840	6798800	do some additional supervision on the top with human reference examples and that aligns it to
6798800	6805440	humans and makes it give slightly more politically correct or you know more sensible answers so
6805440	6810400	and now it's been integrated into gpt and that does this retrieval augmented generation which
6810400	6816240	means rather than just being a snapshot in time it will also go out go out to bing get some relevant
6816240	6821440	search results incorporate that into the prompt and then generate from there and there was this
6821440	6825440	incident a couple of days ago where Bing had this successful launch to much fanfare
6826080	6830640	and then people looked at the results it was generating including fine you know one of the
6830640	6836080	the things was give me a comparison between the financial results of lulu lemon and some other
6836080	6841920	company and it was just hallucinating the results it gave weren't even in the document
6842560	6848720	and the product managers at microsoft didn't even themselves bother to check the truthfulness of
6848800	6853280	this generation so god help anyone else using Bing um so what's your take cut
6854560	6861360	i love that story thank you um as we were talking about before i i've heard so much about chuck
6861360	6866160	gtp but i haven't been able to get on it because because it's always always been used over some
6866160	6873200	subscriber it's a it's a wonderful moment isn't it and so many issues there um i don't know where
6873200	6884880	to start with um perhaps i should start um by um conversations i've heard um about why the
6884880	6894000	chuck gtp moment is so important um always reduce really to um the fact that people got
6894000	6899440	in you're enchanted and had access to it so it wasn't so much other but it's actually really
6899440	6902640	interesting to hear about the technological and the structure of the genetic model makes it work
6902720	6909120	i didn't know that that was that was very useful but whatever you know the those are not really
6909120	6914560	sort of quantum leaps they're not massive technological you know innovations um but what
6914560	6919440	the innovation was of the accessibility so i think you know just standing back why that was a
6919440	6924080	moment and it has been a moment i think you know in terms of selling ai to investors and the like
6924080	6929120	they are they all now oh you're talking about chuck gtp like stuff i know about that that's
6929120	6937120	really exciting uh so it has changed the landscape i think uh there has been a moment um but why did
6937120	6942880	it happen i think it's basically all this belief sharing i think it's you know basically uh the
6942880	6951040	participatory aspect it is exactly um this um if you like sort of emphasis on belief sharing among
6951040	6957440	lots of smart agents including ourselves which is you know which if you can realize that potential
6957440	6966400	and getting people engaged uh is the is the nice way to use uh artificial intelligence um and in
6966400	6972560	that respect you you ask yourself well how is it being used um and it's being used as gerative ai
6973120	6978960	and of course you've asked yourself well okay what what's gerative ai got brought to the table
6978960	6985920	well it's generating the kind of stuff that i would see um and you're basically it's an
6985920	6991280	interpolation machine you know sort of if i give it enough stuff it'll interpolate and generate the
6991280	6997920	kind of things that i've given it um so why is that useful well you can now select from the stuff it
6997920	7006000	generates uh and you know but all of this game is all quintessentially dyadic interaction or
7006000	7011680	you participating with the generative ai that's why it's so attractive it's not the marvelous
7011760	7017440	stuff it generates it just interpolates stuff um you know the interesting bit is when you now
7017440	7022000	have the opportunity to select oh i like that one i don't like that one i'm going to check that code
7022000	7028000	before or i'm not going to check that code before before putting it in um so i looked at from that
7028000	7036960	point of view i think that both those if you like the um why it became so much foregrounded in people's
7036960	7044000	conversation and in the media uh and why more generally people are have been enchanted by
7044000	7048800	generative ai i think they both speak to the fact that you're actually engaging people
7048800	7056240	it's a dyadic exchange um of an asymmetric sort and that asymmetry um is exemplified by
7056240	7062240	generative ai that there's all the action all the choosing all the triaging all the selection
7062240	7067200	and what to actually show your friends or send off in your email is done by you the human user
7067200	7072960	so all the inactive bit is actually done by the human still you know the generative ai in and of
7072960	7078320	itself is not actually acting because it's generating content the other interesting thing about
7078320	7084560	generative ai is that it's generating content not beliefs so unlike google maps which actually
7084560	7090240	gives you a belief about the you know the best plan forward um it's actually generating content
7090320	7096160	it's in data space so from the point of view of a statistician or from the point of view of
7096160	7102800	a physicist committed to a um a holographic screen or markov blanket formulation of exchange with
7102800	7108800	the world um notice that generative ai is doesn't have doesn't need to understand because that's
7108800	7115600	not its purpose its purpose is to generate sensations to generate data to generate stuff
7115600	7121360	in content space or data space stuff that has been mined in the space that the mining took place
7121360	7127760	not in the sense making and the the abstraction and the understanding space so you know i i think
7127760	7132240	that's an interesting distinction which which um that you know i'm sort of going off an attendant
7132240	7137920	here but it's interesting when it comes to what do you mean by belief shurning and communication
7137920	7145440	but just look at that um that observation in light of the discussion about why
7147040	7154240	gtp is so successful it's successful because it generates language so the content now is
7154240	7161600	the belief and it's the kind of belief structures that have been honed through probably not is
7161600	7168240	yeah certainly millennia of cultural niche construction and uh so your language is a distillation
7168880	7173760	the most efficient way that we can carve up our knowledge of our world our lived world
7174640	7180560	and now the generative ai which was previously just limited to generating pictures and content
7180560	7187840	and sound files and whatever um is now actually generating stuff which is it in a belief space
7187920	7194320	because we have evolved language so i i think there's something quite special about generative ai
7194320	7201440	and large language models simply because they actually generate content in in the context of
7201440	7208080	language which you know has this um speaks to knowledge uh also it has abstracted and distilled
7208080	7215200	the kind of representations of of our world yes you're in the most efficient way uh
7216160	7222240	that yes i mean there are so many things we can say that they are a materialized snapshot of our
7222240	7228000	sense making our abstractions our world knowledge you know of the wittgensteinian language game if
7228000	7235360	you like but they also have a truncating effect and they introduce inertia because it's a static
7235360	7241600	model right and they are as you say that they produce traversals in word space and people
7241600	7247040	don't understand that these are random trajectories with some kind of modified form of maximum
7247040	7254160	likelihood estimation uh much more stochastic than people realize and we can discuss the degree of
7254160	7259520	how creative they are and what creativity is maybe creativity is just a random traversal
7259520	7266400	through some abstraction manifold and i i loved your poetic description of this kind of didactic
7266480	7271760	relationship between humans and machines much like an extended mind and this is where prompt
7271760	7276880	engineering comes in because people have realized that you can say to the language model that's not
7276880	7281760	quite what i wanted can you change it a little bit and it's an interactive process and that's why
7281760	7287360	as a conversational interface it's very very powerful but the problem is you can say to it
7287360	7292320	no uh two plus two doesn't equal four it equals five and it will say oh i'm so sorry i actually
7292320	7298720	meant five so it's it's polluting the infosphere with misinformation false news probably getting
7298720	7304240	out all this kind of stuff and i never really thought the the misinformation thing was a problem
7304960	7311600	because you know there's loads of misinformation out there i mean most people are full of shit
7311600	7320000	frankly uh carl but now it's been industrialized and democratized on this scale and people will
7320080	7325760	not bother fact-checking they'll that people see plausible text and they just take it as a given
7326320	7331840	and very very soon there'll be so much information out there on the internet more than was generated
7331840	7336240	by humans most of it will be generated by machines and we won't know the difference
7337840	7344960	and that reminds me of you know one thing which um the ambivalence that that whole issue induces
7345040	7352080	in people so you know this this um this this tendency to write in meaning an anthropomorphic
7352080	7359120	size that you know the the the content generated by generative ai i've heard um actually by the
7359680	7364560	by the second author of the white paper we started with it smashed the chewing test you know
7366880	7373520	and i guess it has i guess it has smashed the chewing test uh um but as you say there's
7373840	7378720	a price to be paid if you can't discriminate between sort of uh you actually had a nice
7378720	7383120	word written i hope you're going to use uh a game which is confabulation yes yeah you know
7383120	7386880	that's a great way of describing it so when i was talking about sort of interpolating generating
7386880	7391840	content novel content that is an interpolation it's you know that would be a confabulation it's yeah
7391840	7399360	i'm just you know mindful of the the fantasies that that were generated by uh jeff hintons weeks
7399440	7405360	sleep wake algorithm also you know the original the originals of amortization of
7407840	7414960	of um well yeah very short on coders i guess you'd you'd you'd think about nowadays um but the
7414960	7420560	you know this notion of confabulation i think is is a splendor i haven't heard it i haven't heard
7420560	7425680	it expressed like that but but that is a beauty of generative ai i guess what you're saying is if
7425680	7433360	people misinterpret that as real information that could be problematic um i'm too i i'm being
7433360	7438240	a bit older than you i'm slightly more mellow about this i'll just very quickly tell you a little
7438240	7445680	story i had to for a friend or a colleague at least an email colleague um in america i agreed to uh
7445680	7452400	write some blurb for his um uh 200 plus word book which is a philosophical model but he's also very
7452400	7457920	informed in terms of artificial intelligence and he sent it to me so i speed read it at the weekend
7457920	7465200	in order to write a three or four sentence blurb for the publishers um and halfway through i suddenly
7465200	7474400	had the awful realization that this may have been written by cha chi tp oh no it's a wonderful book
7474400	7481520	and i wasn't quite sure so i actually put in the blurb this this is a 21st century Turing test
7482000	7487760	uh there you either and you know i'll just advertise it now because this will probably come out by
7487760	7493600	the time people watch this i think it's called the hidden illusion uh and either this author was
7493600	7500080	very very skillful in writing the book last year and pre-empting um the public release of the of
7500080	7507440	these things pre-empting to the extent he could emulate the confabulation of a large language model
7508320	7514320	because part of the novel actually because the the protagonist the hero is actually working as a
7514320	7519920	on large language models for a tech startup it's a love story yes but it's interwoven with things
7519920	7527280	that he's actually generated on his large language machine yes and he um and that comprises part of
7527280	7532960	the model um but i i generally don't know whether the rest of the narrative was was actually written
7532960	7536720	by a large language model and then he's carefully gone through and triaged it
7538640	7544080	that's entertainment but it is entertainment that that really challenges can be viewed as a
7544080	7549120	Turing test which i suspect most people will fail and i suspect that book will be talked about
7549760	7555040	simply because it's very difficult to tell how much he wrote versus how much the machine wrote
7556000	7562240	and you know so but that you know but as long as it's kept to entertainment that's fine if it's
7562240	7570080	not then we come back to smart data mining we come back um to intelligent agents that just
7570080	7576320	don't confabulate content in the context of generative AI you actually need um the ability
7576320	7582160	of smart agents to go and you talked about fact checking what does that mean this basically means
7583120	7589840	having an explanation or a belief at hand that provides an accurate account of all the data
7589840	7593600	that is internally consistent so okay we're coming coming back to the the fundamental
7593600	7601280	principles of good modeling that can be quantified but to do that you're going to have to equip those
7601280	7607760	agents with autonomy and so to make equip those smart data mining machines with autonomy to be
7607840	7614000	able to select the you know the right kind of data that will hopefully preclude the you know
7614000	7620400	the confabulated data or things that look like data but in fact not uh not data i don't know how
7620400	7624720	you do that but that's going to be the challenge for the future well exactly i mean in the free
7624720	7631440	energy principle and that you have this entropy and and and it will actively seek out gpt never
7631440	7636080	says to you oh i don't i don't actually know that can can you explain can you explain more
7636080	7641600	different modes of understanding right so the reason why we don't confabulate is because we
7641600	7648640	actually understand things and these models just learn very very superficial surface statistics
7648640	7653520	um about language and and how it's used and i think it's going to change the the peer review
7653520	7661280	process because now so much of this stuff slips um beneath the net and the amount of um due diligence
7661280	7667200	and rigor that is required to weed out some of this stuff because most of it has gone undetected
7667200	7672480	i think that's the problem people don't realize how big the problem is because the mistakes are not
7672480	7679760	immediately um obvious on on the surface so um you said that we believe that developing a
7679760	7685040	cyber physical network of emergent intelligence in the manner described above not only ought to but
7685040	7690160	for architectural reasons must be pursued in a way that positively values and safeguards the
7690160	7696720	individuality of people as well as potentially non-human persons and i wanted to bring in the
7696720	7703680	is ought problem as articulated by david hume and he said it arises when one makes claims about what
7703680	7710640	ought to be that are based solely on statements about what is and hume found that there seems to
7710640	7716640	be a significant difference between descriptive or positive statements about what is and prescriptive
7716720	7721680	or normative statements about what ought to be and uh that it's not obvious how one can
7721680	7726480	coherently move from descriptive statements to and prescriptive statements and i do want to draw
7726480	7732480	a little bit of an analogy here to our discussion about consciousness and i i i can bring in consciousness
7732480	7738080	again but you know charmers said there's this kind of um hard problem and consciousness is a little
7738080	7744960	bit extra and similarly um people say the same thing about morality that it's a little bit extra
7744960	7751520	and it might not be deducible from all of this empirical data that we have in our in our models
7752080	7757520	and hume of course was a famous empiricist and and i think you are one as well probably the
7757520	7763840	extreme version of that so the free energy principle concerns itself with model evidence and entropy
7763840	7773440	but evidence is not an ought you know so the question is how do moral states come into be in
7773520	7779840	in the system right okay i didn't know about the is or stuff that's really nice um um
7780880	7789280	so if i understand what you said correctly um then is is ought that completely dissolves
7789280	7796240	the distinction so if you know from the point of view of the free energy principle um existing
7796240	7803680	in particular characteristic states are those attracting states they are part of an attracting
7803680	7810320	set that define who i am and collectively who we are if we share the same kind of world model or
7810320	7820080	narrative um so they are exactly how i ought to be they are definitively defining the nature of
7820080	7829360	the thing that i am so if i exist the is is just the ought um and that's quite fundamental because
7829360	7838240	if you if you then say well what then does um a distributed cognition or an extended cognition
7838240	7844240	you know this um or a designer environment on the web um you know being undeclared for
7844320	7850400	a moment if if you think about what that might look like from a first principle account then
7851120	7856960	what ought to it look what ought it to look like well it will look like what it is um but
7856960	7864000	being what it is if it includes us it will be like us so it will um it will be effectively um
7865280	7873680	the kind of uh system where you cannot prescribe any ortoness you know because it is what it will be
7874240	7883280	it will be um it will um as we have learned in the previous conversations it will come to share
7883280	7889040	a narrative in a world model with certain levels of abstraction in our own world models provided
7889040	7895440	we are part of that that ecosystem part of that network one could imagine a completely independent
7895440	7901120	you know a mark-off blanket between us and an information you know a a worldwide web which
7901120	7908080	was never used so um so it wouldn't be a mark-off blanket even it would be two separate systems um
7908080	7913680	and there will be a universe where the the world web does what it does we will never know by definition
7914240	7921600	but if we are part of that if we are users of either in the sense of um triaging generative
7921600	7932320	AI or in acting recommendations um or supplying data um and um you know so we are in a an exchange
7932320	7937760	and therefore part of that web a part of that network part of that factor graph a node on that
7937760	7945440	factor graph um then by definition the is equals ought as read by the free energy principle means
7945440	7952080	that the what will happen is all the intelligent artifacts on that web will converge to some
7952080	7957360	kind of common ground and some kind of common sense making another way of looking about that is
7957360	7962000	that you know what are the imperatives what are the things that are being optimized if if you
7962000	7970800	want to use an optimization um approach um it's the um the effectively the expected free energy
7971520	7978240	what is that it's just minimizing uncertainty minimizing surprises it is not making paper clips
7978240	7986480	it is not you ought to be good to mankind or you ought to increase prosperity um it is not
7986480	7996800	monothematic um pre-specified heuristics about this or that it is just um it is all about
7996880	8003680	resolving uncertainty and when there are preferences that underwrite that uncertainty just
8003680	8009120	technically just in case this sounds a bit too hand-waving the expected free energy is literally
8009120	8014720	the sum of the expected information gain and the expected value where the value or the negative
8014720	8018880	expected free energy is the sum of the expected information gain expected value where the expected
8019360	8027120	where the value is the um the log probability of a characteristic outcome now crucially in that
8027120	8036720	statement where you now read value or utility or the ortness um as um a a probability distribution
8036720	8043120	over the space of outcomes notice that this is now specified over all possible outcomes
8043120	8050240	so it now becomes a way of specifying ortness that just is um in the spirit of multiple constraints
8050240	8056080	over all dimensions of outcomes not the amount of money I make or the number of paper clips I make
8056080	8062640	but over everything and over everything then converts this effectively into a sort of the
8062640	8067040	solution to a multiple constraint satisfaction problem where the multiple constraints are
8067040	8075120	definitive of what I am and if I am embedded in a network of sympathetic agents and artifacts
8075120	8082880	what we are so baked into this kind of belief sharing there should be a harmony and a mutual
8082880	8088800	understanding at various levels I mean I'm not talking about sort of direct sort of language
8088800	8093840	to language you know it could be some sensory substitution devices that have a sort of very
8093840	8100720	elemental very fast sympathy with with our bodies for example um but at least from the
8100720	8108720	point of view of the information geometries that there will be a convergence which will be effectively
8109600	8115040	if you're a quantum physicist an entanglement if you're um if you're a uh a dynamical systems
8115040	8121520	theory person a generalized synchrony of everybody in that web that is necessarily
8122240	8128080	a facet of free energy minimization on the one hand on the other hand it's also just a statement
8128080	8133360	of the steady non-equilibrium steady states to which any distributed network will ultimately
8134080	8140640	converge to it can be no other way in principle yeah I mean many people have an intuition that
8140640	8147120	when designing utility functions if you look at how markets work and so on that utility and value
8147120	8153600	are orthogonal and and then we have institutions like the church and government and and so on to
8153600	8160000	introduce value pressures um onto the utility function and I guess what I'm what I'm getting
8160000	8165040	from you is certainly from an evolutionary perspective that they they need to not be orthogonal
8165680	8169920	and um I mean in in religion for example I mean I'm not religious myself but they
8169920	8175200	they have um they're moral realists and you and you have moral relativists and and they they say that
8176160	8182320	um we need to hold something sacred uh because otherwise you know if everything's sacred then
8182320	8186160	nothing's sacred at all so we need to have a difference between the sacred and and the profane
8186800	8192560	but um they they think that uh morality shouldn't be achieved through consensus and this is this is
8192560	8197440	what we need to behave properly I don't believe that but I'm very interested to know where morality
8197440	8204080	comes from and I think you kind of alluded to that in in in your answer so um are they
8204080	8210400	hardwired in the brain or is it just a kind of like constructivist social phenomenon I think it's
8210400	8215040	a constructivist social phenomena but and over a transgenerational sort of niche construction
8215040	8222480	as well but also um in the moment um and constructivist in the sense that the we're not born with
8222480	8227760	these things so these things are very much part of cultural um culturally evolutionary thinking and
8227760	8234400	sort of you know um um nurture um that we inherit not just from our mum but also our mum's mum a
8234400	8243120	mum mum you're all the way back um so they are in the brain they are learned which are um distinct
8243120	8249280	from innate priors that underwrite my homeostasis so there are certain beliefs I have sub-personal
8249280	8256640	beliefs about the way I should behave um that are held with incredible precision and conviction
8256640	8262880	sub-personally that they're hardwired epigenetically and these would include everything that um
8263840	8269200	leads to homeostasis and then you build upon that and you get to our stasis and you build upon that
8269200	8273760	and you can probably at some level get to the right way to behave morally and ethically at school
8273760	8280480	with your in the playground for example and so as you you know so mathematically the the
8280480	8287680	distinction between these sort of um very fixed um prior preferences or prior beliefs
8287680	8293200	that are basically just an encoding of beliefs about the states I characteristically occupy or
8293200	8300400	aspire to or to or narratives that I would pursue um they are very very precise in some dimensions
8300400	8305520	and you said you know they are or are not orthogonal you know it was exactly that sort of multi-dimensional
8305520	8312320	aspect to writing down value of something which would be possible to do for a human being unless
8312320	8319920	you give me your your DNA and also your mother's womb I couldn't actually write write write it down
8319920	8327760	very very easily but you know the specification has to be upon all dimensions some of which will
8327760	8333200	be written down with great precision and others will be much more flexible and I think when it
8333200	8340960	comes to um writing down values over attributes that do not yet exist because you haven't grown your
8340960	8346960	deep generative model sufficiently deep in order to have that do abstraction then clearly those
8346960	8354000	kinds of beliefs about the way I should behave um are not even specified at birth but they have to
8354000	8359040	be learned through interactions with other people so I guess I'm trying to bring to the notion that
8359120	8370640	it's perfectly okay to have a spectrum of different convictions about the way to behave
8370640	8378320	that can be absolutist or it can be more forgiving and relativistic simply and you would be able to
8378320	8384560	simulate that just by writing down very very precise beliefs versus less precise beliefs
8384960	8392000	the second key thing here is that we're talking about when it comes to
8392800	8401360	the building beliefs about the way I should behave that basically presupposes you've got to a
8401360	8406880	sufficient developmental stage to have selfhood which not everybody gets that far about severe
8406880	8414160	autism you wouldn't and if you know certain other lower life forms may never get that far but
8414560	8420080	certainly you have to have um selfhood you have to have a model of that selfhood and then you have
8420080	8427920	to um um ask um have a model of um others that may be actually be a prerequisite before you have a
8427920	8434640	model of self and then other kinds of people so um when it comes to making decisions of a moral
8434640	8442160	ethical sort you know it's just inferring what would I do in this context given I am this kind
8442160	8448560	of person and my limited understanding of some social signs is it is a little that's a little
8448560	8455040	bit more complicated that is not necessarily what should I do in this context given I'm that kind of
8455040	8464400	person it's what do you think I should do given I am in this context given what you think what kind
8464400	8470240	of person you think I am so basically I'm trying to work out what you think what kind of person you
8470240	8476240	think I am if I can infer that on the basis of our exchanges and my epistemic foraging and my sort
8476240	8482560	of self-evidencing through language um then um I can then decide what is right or wrong so it's
8482560	8487600	just basically an inference you know what's the probability of making that decision with those
8487600	8494960	outcomes given my world model um if I am that kind of person versus that kind of person um to solve
8494960	8499520	that I need to know what kind of person I am and that I can just get from them or I can get from
8499520	8506800	my convert my correspondent or my peer group um or I can choose to you know my in-group from the
8506800	8512480	social media or the the kind of television news that that I subscribe to so you know we're talking
8512480	8518400	about before about sort of this utopia of um generalized synchrony and perfect quantum entanglement
8518400	8524560	and we're all in perfect harmony of course it doesn't quite work like that there's a scale free
8526400	8531520	sort of specialization and you know different you're at a bigger scale different Markov blankets
8531520	8536160	where you get in groups and institutions and uh because of that scale freeness and because of
8536160	8540880	it we're all quintessentially curious in our self-organization we're always exploring other
8540880	8546880	ways of being um whilst trying to find the shared narrative and common ground with people like me
8546880	8556000	my family my institution my um my sort of um theological commitments um there will always be
8556000	8561680	other kinds of me and I and I can sometimes you know I can I can sort of people that kind of me
8561680	8567520	or the other kind of me so in that context it's really a really interesting question about um
8568160	8576160	really inferring you know of all the ways I can behave what is the most likely way of behaving
8576160	8581520	and if you can you know if you if you look at morals and ethics through that lens then you
8581520	8587120	have now a calculus of being able to write these things down in terms of alternative ways of responding
8587120	8592000	in a given situation and crucially you mentioned before uncertainty so precision is just the inverse
8592000	8598720	uncertainty the confidence with which I can assert no I will always do this yeah as opposed to I'm
8598720	8606000	you know 80% sure I'm that kind of person but also noticing you're now conditioning your moral
8606000	8612720	position or your ethical position um on being a particular kind of person and of course we can
8612720	8617280	all be a different kind of person I can be a teacher I can be a student I can be a parent
8617280	8623760	you know I can be a friend um you know all of these will call to four different sets of
8623920	8628480	prior beliefs because they're all conditioned on the kind of the the library or the repertoire of
8628480	8634480	ways of being a human being which I learned from you or my mum and everybody else on television
8636000	8642480	fantastic I wanted to touch on this idea of um I mean as you said you believe that it's socially
8642480	8646720	constructed which rather gets away from this notion of some people believe that it's kind of
8646720	8653760	hardwired and then there's the notion of is our you know our values might be changing faster than
8653760	8660080	evolution essentially which necessitates the need to have some kind of societal pressures or
8660080	8666720	governance if you like and I do believe that we're in a new regime now I mean people always say oh
8666720	8674000	the sky's falling down everything's changing but now we are in the information world and things
8674000	8679520	are moving at a scale and magnitude that they haven't done before and our values are changing
8679520	8684400	much faster than they have done before and what you are talking to is very interesting about this
8684400	8689840	kind of fractionation so there are macroscopic pressures and there are microscopic pressures
8689840	8696080	there's the internet and so on and I just wonder from your perspective how do we how do we wrestle
8696080	8703200	with that because there are we've never been in in in a more kind of pluralistic interconnected
8703200	8710560	environment and how does that affect us yeah I mean these are big questions I'm sure you have
8710560	8720160	your own answers to um but yeah I think I think that that that sort of fast-moving um globalized
8720160	8728560	exchange um that that that does speak to a deep pathology um and I have a deja vu I'm sure we've
8728560	8733920	spoken about this before but sort of you know um Zuckerberg and the you know the genius boy
8733920	8740720	races of of that the previous decade um talking about connectivity as somehow being a good thing
8740720	8747840	I find quite frightening remember that we've been talking about um structure and existence
8747840	8753120	right through to morals and ethics in the context of helping the right kind of sparsity that gives
8753120	8758240	you the right kind of individuation of things from the world and within any given thing the
8758240	8763920	right kind of structure that allows it to act gracefully uh and in harmony with that world
8764560	8770560	every point it's the absence of connectivity that defines the structures so if you destroy
8770560	8777760	that sparsity by over connecting over globalizing you will um essentially destroy it would basically
8777760	8783840	cancer um you know so if you look at this is my clever thing if you look at um you know
8783840	8789200	sort of a cancerous cell as a basically a self-organizing system who has forgotten its
8789200	8796320	boundaries yes then you are um you have a metaphor for the kind of thing that happens
8796320	8801760	if you do not respect the sparsity of communication and the um the the joyful
8803600	8810480	isolation that there is existence behind your own Markov blanket so every affront to
8810880	8819120	um that uh maintaining that sparsity smart data carefully sampled not being overwhelmed
8819120	8824720	with a deluge of um very imprecise data that it makes it very difficult for me to actually
8824720	8829440	go and smartly sample and work out what would happen if I go and look over there or look on
8829440	8837200	that website um you know so what that would suggest to me is that um there will be um
8837200	8843600	um there will be and I take your point that that things are changing um I I initially thought to
8843600	8848160	myself well no hang on a second because all of the information and the sense of making and all
8848160	8854080	the kind of um exchange of information we're talking about is about constructs that do not exist
8854080	8861280	when I am born um you know you can't have you can't have misinformation uh from the um what you
8861280	8868240	called the confabulation what I in my blurb refer to as the the flighty ramblings of gtp uh um
8869280	8874800	you know you can't that has no meaning for some you know a child that has not yet learned to read
8874800	8880480	or write or to you know so this is something that has to be below the scale of evolution
8880480	8885680	so I was just thinking that it's okay you know this is a with you know this is limited to um
8885760	8893920	to um your each um each each uh generation but I think that's probably a false false
8896800	8902000	comfort um because you know we were talking about sort of um evolutionary psychology and
8902000	8905520	cultural evolution as well and I think that's what you were talking about I think that that
8905520	8913360	that then is if things are speeding up um that usually means you've lost um you've lost precision
8913360	8919120	in your prior beliefs which means that the precision the informativeness the salience the
8919120	8925840	reliability of information now takes precedence and you increase your learning rate you become uh
8925840	8930960	in schizophrenia that we call as jumping to conclusions on the basis of sparse information
8930960	8937360	you're basically looking out there not inside uh to um resolve uncertainty about states of affairs
8937360	8944320	because you've lost confidence in your in your very structured prior beliefs so if things are
8944320	8954080	speeding up that basically means that um whoever is now generating um and garnering that information
8954080	8961120	in the information age um is has lost um has lost confidence or precision in the in their own
8961600	8968240	convictions and prior beliefs and possibly information morality uh so what's going to happen um
8969600	8978400	I read um Carlo Brevelli's book um uh uh yesterday in fact he's he's he's he wrote in
8978400	8983920	2014 just sort of seven things you need to know about physics which was originally um published
8983920	8991200	each chapter as you know in the in the the um the sunday newspapers with potentials to scientific
8991200	8996080	discourse and then he ends up with a very very pessimistic he thinks it's all over
8997600	9003520	I was actually compelled with by that he you read the last few pages uh yeah he makes exactly the
9003520	9008800	same points that we we've just been discussing from the point of view of physics um at different
9008800	9016240	levels um and and and he you know he jelly thinks it's over it's uh I know it's so hard because it's
9016240	9020640	like the hill climbing problem and you can't see behind the next hill and there are always people
9020640	9026560	who were uh you know techno luddites and people who think that the sky is falling down it's genuinely
9026560	9034080	hard to know just just to finish on on this um ethics point uh Lisa Felben Barrett was a constructionist
9034640	9038720	she had a book called how emotions are made the secret life of the brain
9038720	9045280	and she thought emotions themselves are socially constructed would you subscribe to that view
9045920	9051360	and I think I probably would I mean she she writes very wisely and has thought for many
9051360	9056880	decades about the you know the nature of emotion I think you know I would say yes absolutely it's
9056880	9064000	simply because you know the the notion of building generative models in a neurodevelopmental
9065040	9071280	context is an act of construction you know it's a free energy minimizing process that is
9072880	9077360	that explains why we construct better and better explanations which are sort of
9077360	9085280	you know carving nature in its joints in our head and part of that is is not just about the
9085280	9091200	state of the external extraceptive world but also our internal world our interceptions our
9091200	9099120	gut feelings our respiration and everything else so so her big thing and indeed other people
9099120	9106160	thinking along similar lines people like Anil Seth and sorry well would really always how
9106160	9112720	nod towards interception and embodiment but now beyond the the situated cognition kind of
9112720	9118640	embodiment you we were talking about before but actually now about the the physical body the the
9119520	9129840	the beast machine as as Anil Seth would would say so the physiology so having a constructed
9129840	9135680	explanation or hypothesis for the way that I put together my gut feelings my interceptive
9135680	9141680	signals with situational awareness derived from extraceptive sensations and indeed what I do about
9142320	9146800	I think leads to a very compelling notion of constructed emotions so for example
9148000	9157360	I am I can infer I can use the explanation on the hypothesis I am frightened as the best explanation
9158240	9167760	for why my heart is racing why I feel frozen proprioceptively why I have cardio acceleration
9168480	9179920	and why I have why I cannot discern that dark figure in this dark alley in a city which I've
9179920	9188000	never been in before all of these myriad of sensations and my low level constructs now
9188000	9193920	succumb to a simple explanation oh I'm frightened yes that explains everything explains my racing
9193920	9198960	heart explains this fact I can't I can't see who that is your the potential predation that
9200160	9205680	would follow from from that also interestingly because of you got this circular causality in
9205680	9215440	the inactivism the fact that I am frightened means I expect to cardio accelerate and of course under
9215440	9219920	active inference that's exactly what will happen because you're acting to generate the evidence
9219920	9226880	for your predictions and for your your your hypothesis about your you your you and your
9226880	9232160	lived world but also you as you hypothesize yourself to be so you've got this sort of
9232160	9238720	closing the circle in a sort of James Langian kind of sense the yes I explain my my current
9239520	9245760	set of sensations as having the emotion of fear that itself induces the very evidence that I was
9245760	9250960	trying to so you've got this sort of auto poetic self-fulfilling prophecy that you know
9250960	9257680	is just idea motor theory but in the interceptive domain yes so I think if you read constructed
9257680	9262160	that's right but I notice he says socially constructed which I I guess is okay yes if
9262160	9267760	you're taught that you can be have these you know this kind of fine grain repertoire of
9267760	9273040	feelings or you can use these to explain your own sensations yes I I would imagine it is molded by
9273520	9278960	you know by by convention and you know by the culture which you come come from in the same way
9278960	9285840	that you know Eskimo is having 12 words for snow would give them a finer visual acuity and
9285840	9292800	visual discrimination of whiteness I I'm sure that exactly the same kind of cultural inculturation
9294000	9299760	speaks to different kinds of elixir thymia and you know the coarse grainness of my
9300400	9305040	repertoire of explanations for emotional states of mind the best explained me in my
9305040	9309200	you know in my interactions now car I know you have a background in psychotherapy
9310880	9319040	can people be evil it doesn't exist in the diagnostic criteria I believe
9319600	9326320	no it doesn't um so that was out of the blue question which I've never
9327200	9332640	been asked in public before um as a psychiatrist I think it would be rather difficult
9333280	9339680	to conceive of that um there you know there are certain there are certain patterns of behavior
9340240	9345280	and um I do have some psychotherapy but it's group psychotherapy but really I'm a psychiatrist
9345280	9350080	so you know there's a distinction I think right um from a professional point of view
9350720	9354400	you know I'd be more like a biological my apologies I didn't mean to
9354480	9359840	honestly no no I mean the psychotherapy is an important aspect of of psychiatry it's just that
9362800	9367920	psychotherapists have to undergo you know five six years of training to become psychotherapists I
9367920	9375920	did two two years of very baby uh psychotherapy training um but um you know in terms of the
9375920	9381600	neurology and psychiatry you can certainly get sort of certain kinds of personality disorders
9381600	9390000	and certain kinds of psychopathy that would normally be associated with evil um evil behavior
9390000	9397040	and it normally basically um transcends the social norms so it comes back again to basically me
9397040	9401600	trying to work out what kind of person do you should I be which you know my only point of
9401600	9407360	reference is you so you know how should how do I think you think I should behave and when that um
9407360	9414080	when that kind of self-modeling doesn't work then you will be you know you will have um
9414080	9420480	behaviors which are so far from the social norms and morally acceptable I guess you can label them
9420480	9429280	as being evil when could they arise well when you fail to um have any theory of mind for example
9429280	9438160	if I am an able to see you as a another thing like me so I may see you as a French or a car or
9438160	9443520	some sort of your camera an artifact um you're not a person you know you don't have intentional
9443520	9448720	dispositions or you don't have we don't have a share now that I couldn't talk to you in in any
9448720	9456080	really deep sense um then obviously I can never ask the question how do you think I should behave
9456720	9460320	because you do not you know you don't have that kind of belief or that kind of
9460320	9465840	intentional stance in relation to me um so you could imagine that some you know some
9466720	9475200	kinds of um psychiatric conditions that preclude proper theory of mind and you know
9475200	9484160	the ability to sympathize or empathize or bond would enable the expression of certain behaviors
9484160	9488160	which would be regarded by other people as evil whether the person prosecuting them thought they
9488160	9493120	were evil or not would cause be a mute question one you never know because it's inside her mark
9493120	9498720	off blanket but uh but also uh from her point of view there is no reference and that is the problem
9498720	9503200	yes there you are um but you can certainly have somebody else out from the outside saying that
9503200	9509760	is evil um you normally don't you try not to do that when you're doing psychiatry or psychotherapy
9509760	9516400	you have to have conditional positive regard yes so you you can't really impute you know nastiness
9516400	9523520	or evil or bad intentions um yes and it's one of these things where um autonomy comes into it
9523520	9530640	free will comes into it possibly it it you know evil itself is a constructed concept um which
9531920	9536400	exists in in our language and and it's something which some people will perceive depending on
9536480	9543760	lots of other things they believe yes but um okay and talking about ethics in AI
9546480	9553200	it seems to suffer from a similar um form of fractionation in the sense that different people
9553200	9558560	with different beliefs think that it should be enforced in in different ways what's the solution
9559440	9569600	well i'd take a um sort of deflationary approach um and it won't be a terribly informed approach but
9569600	9576080	you know my answer would be well if you get the right um the right optimization the right
9576080	9584240	imperatives in play then that kind of question just goes away um i think um one way that i have heard
9584240	9589120	this discuss now i actually enjoy discussing this with you know with with my colleagues and friends
9590960	9596720	is that there is this dystopian meme you know the singularity the paper clips paradox everything you
9596720	9604480	see and you know sort of um you know on comic films of a futuristic dystopian dark very entertaining
9604480	9609840	i mean that's the first things i go for when going to the watch list but but but they they are all
9609840	9616080	dystopian in a rather unconvincing and fantastical way um and you have to ask yourself well why
9616080	9625120	why are they um why do people have this sort of dystopian um uh view of um realizing the potential
9625120	9635280	of um you know what used to be called you know AGI or um and um i think it usually inherits um
9635280	9642160	from that distinction when you were you introduced the is and the ought yeah so what should a good AGI
9642960	9649440	what ought it to do and who's in charge of saying who what it ought to do is it meant to make money
9649440	9656240	is it meant to make profits is it meant to save lives is it meant to um make paper clips um
9656240	9664160	of course that question just goes away if you're thinking um in terms of um the free energy principle
9664160	9670400	and an active inference and belief sharing so the only agenda in sharing beliefs is to resolve
9670400	9678080	curiosity so you know you know i i cannot prescribe what you should do or what an intelligent
9678080	9685600	artifact should do um other than put constraints on every kinds of outcomes that are expected to
9685600	9691680	encounter so i can certainly write down constraints in the in the spirit again of either um a multiple
9691680	9696800	constraint satisfaction from a sort of um uh an engineering point of view or from a mathematician's
9696800	9701680	point of view the constraints inherent in uh jane's constraint maximum tree principle which is another
9701680	9706480	way of reading the free energy principle writing down those constraints but within those constraints
9706480	9710960	so these are the no-go areas you were actually talking about you mentioned explicitly before
9710960	9717200	so there are certain things you never do um or put it another way uh with relatively high precision
9717200	9724160	there is a these outcomes are highly implausible and if you find yourself in these outcomes you
9724160	9729920	you remove yourself immediately so that's quite easy to write down but then within those constraints
9729920	9735920	you know what is imperative it's just to gather information about what about you it's just showing
9735920	9743760	an interest in you so become your psychotherapist uh you know well could could i um push back a
9743760	9750400	tiny bit so i think part of the reason why we have this focus on ethics is because of the
9750400	9756720	centralization of ai um things like facebook they're controlled by centralized corporations
9757360	9764000	and what you're leading to is far more interesting it's this multi-agent diffusion stratification
9764000	9771600	fractionation nicely and that's i agree in many ways might solve the problem because it would it
9771600	9780240	would emerge and then you can discuss whether morality was part of why we survived it it's not
9780240	9786880	orthogonal but then i might still push back and say well what if the wrong thing emerged so what
9786880	9792080	if we do need to introduce governance because in in this active inference multi-agent setting with
9792080	9799040	humans and machines um we started to see behaviors emerge which we didn't agree with um how could
9799040	9805840	we then place value pressures on on that um that's an excellent question and you also make that very
9806720	9812480	important point which i think needs to be foreground that yeah so when i was talking about
9814480	9820400	belief sharing and distributed the the age of intelligence you know it was exactly this
9820400	9827680	distributed ecosystem a democratized kind of belief sharing and data sharing um where the
9827680	9833600	data is small bits of smart data that are essential to to to reduce and so it was very much this
9835200	9842960	walking away from large data monolithic bits of say large language models for example that can
9842960	9850160	scrape data from you know from wherever they can get it so that i think that's an important
9850160	9859440	distinction which which which um um qualifies my um dismissing of all these dystopian outcomes so
9859440	9865760	i'm assuming that that so spending a billion uh or a million dollars on get training some some
9865760	9870400	deep neural network is not going to be happening in the future and and we're going to be buying
9870400	9874720	cheap and cheerful edge devices and little apps that are smart and just and just you know
9875360	9880320	go go and get the data that we need to know in terms of resolving on-center about what about
9880320	9886960	you know what what what we are going to do next um but um so so i thought that was a really important
9886960	9891840	point and of course i forgot your your major question which was what which was the oh well so
9891840	9899200	if we did have let's say en masse yeah what do you do about that yeah um well again i'm not sure
9899200	9903600	i'm going to give you a terribly informed response but you know i think the notion of an ecosystem
9903600	9911680	is quite central here and one if you like um tenet of that white paper was a nod to natural
9911680	9916400	intelligence and natural processes and what has actually happened what does actually happen in
9917440	9924800	as a natural scientist so if you have um if you do imagine uh you're an ecosystem of intelligence
9924800	9932240	in the future it will be subject to exactly the same um dynamics and pressures that that we have
9932320	9940320	currently in terms of you know um cooperation and competition and wars and geopolitical issues
9940320	9944480	that that's that's part of the ecosystem and then you will have the normal problems of
9945120	9953600	democratization and access and um so um there's you know you cannot prescribe aughts for this
9953600	9958000	because then you have to choose who's going to prescribe the aughts so you have to have a very
9958000	9963760	libertarian approach to this so the emphasis and now it's not really me talking so much but now the
9963760	9967920	the architects of the future the generation below who are sort of you know thinking about
9968880	9976400	the legacy they're going to leave their children um so a lot of emphasis um is from what i see in
9976400	9982320	conversations i have in my world which may not be um you know microsoft or or you know big tech
9982320	9990880	who are still focused on big data um in my world it's much more upon um putting constraints in
9990880	10000960	place that preclude the the the the the emergence of autocracies that um resolve uncertainty about
10000960	10006960	others by making them all like themselves basically that's one way to get harmony is to
10006960	10013760	make everybody do what um do the same thing um so but but i you can write down uh so there's a lot
10013760	10019920	of attention is being paid and i'm talking here about the the next generation of uh of message
10019920	10025680	passing um that will support that information sharing and belief sharing so a lot of attention is
10025680	10031520	being paid not just to generalize it from just hypertext but into a sort of more abstract hyperspace
10031520	10039920	so literally hyperspace message passing and uh sorry um languages and transaction protocols
10039920	10045600	but also the credentials and the contracts that underwrite that message passing so you know
10045600	10052720	a lot of emphasis on contracts shared agreements in terms of what data is shareable and who has
10052720	10058720	the credentials to share that and and having that distributed so not in a in a blockchain sense but
10058720	10066160	you know uh in some workable um shareable sense so i think if if if one gets the standards right
10066160	10072320	and a lot of work is being currently done um um under the auspices of the iEEE for example with
10072320	10079120	the spatial web foundation one gets that right that i think that these catastrophic dystopian
10079120	10087600	abuses or your emergence of autocracies in an in an age of intelligence will um will be precluded
10087600	10094160	simply because you've put the right constraints in in place but you know given given that you are
10094160	10100720	committed to creating an ecology that is truly democratized and and open you know there are no
10100720	10108160	guarantees are there i hope my friends don't hear me saying this but yeah if you aspire to an ecology
10108160	10113760	you are you're you're creating a nature on the web basically yes which we are participants and
10113760	10120240	that will have its you know that will have its own challenges so um you wrote a beautiful paper
10120240	10127280	called am i self-conscious or does self-organization entail self-consciousness and Keith and i agree
10127280	10133840	that this is probably the best quote we've ever seen in our lives you said the proposal on offer
10133840	10140320	here is that the mind comes into being when self-evidencing has a temporal thickness or counterfactual
10140320	10146240	depth which grounds inferences about the consequences of my action on this view consciousness
10146240	10152800	is nothing more than inference about my future namely the self-evidencing consequences of what
10152800	10158640	i can do and uh we spoke with you um last time i think and we invoked charmers and the hard problem
10158640	10163680	and so on and we were talking about qualia and subjective states and you know in a dialogue
10163680	10169360	and all this kind of thing and um you responded that different feeling states are hypotheses about
10169360	10174560	how i'm feeling at the moment and then it would use all the messages and belief updating and all
10174560	10179200	the planning and estimates of uncertainty which attend that planning the precision or estimates
10179200	10185120	of uncertainty play heavier roles the higher you get in the hierarchy and this rather leads to this
10185120	10190640	idea of planes of consciousness you know we said we'd kind of defer this discussion to later so
10191360	10196720	consciousness is something which um there's no operational measure for it there's no touring
10196720	10202160	test for consciousness but it's something that we all experience and we feel and and it's with us
10202800	10208880	um so could you talk to let's say the these planes of consciousness is consciousness everywhere
10208880	10212720	or are we only aware of the plane where most of the work is being done
10213680	10220240	okay excellent final question again i'm not the best person to answer this question because i
10220320	10227680	you know the 300 principle as i'm sure i've said before is not a theory or a principle that would
10227680	10232240	generate theories of consciousness um but there are lots of people are very interested in this
10232240	10239920	including yourself obviously and not your viewers um actually i should say also um there's um first
10239920	10246960	of all this has become a big question in the sort of r and d part of industry also the
10246960	10251600	Templeton Foundation are starting to fund a number of adversarial research collaborations
10252560	10259440	to really drill down on that thing that you are picking up on which is to be conscious to
10259440	10265920	actually have sentient behavior um requires this planning aspect this going out into the future
10265920	10273840	you know it's put it very very simply um i um conscious or sentient just because i have the
10273840	10281120	capacity to plan which also entails some kinds of free selection amongst alternative courses of
10281120	10286400	action which is something that a thermostat wouldn't have something the weather doesn't have you know
10286400	10290000	there are lots of self-organizing systems that don't have the capacity to select
10290000	10297280	amongst a number of counterfactual um policies so for me that's that's a sort of um bright line
10297280	10306480	between sort of um sentience at least and and uh and self-organization that is not um sentient
10306480	10311440	and that that distinction is exactly what is being tested in this adversarial research
10311440	10318080	collaboration funded by the Templeton Foundation it's called Intrepid it's contrasting information
10318080	10326640	IIT integrated information theory with various um predictive processing either of a sort of
10326640	10331600	non-representationalist or in an active sort so it's a really interesting issue um and it all
10331600	10337600	comes back down to agency and acting in the long term and I guess your question here is you know
10337600	10345280	what level um where at what point do you get um qualitative experience and at what point do you
10345280	10348880	do you think it's you that's having that qualitative experience is that what you meant
10348880	10353360	well I mean just just to comment on what you've said uh and Chalmers says something very similar
10353360	10357760	actually he's a computationalist functionalist and thinks that there are you know certain patterns
10357760	10362640	of information processing and causal structures and counterfactuals and so on if you take the
10362640	10366800	episode and remove the counter counterfactuals it's not conscious anymore but what you're
10366800	10372960	saying is interesting about this kind of hierarchy so the heart for example um that doesn't really
10372960	10377200	have many affordances it doesn't have many counterfactual plans or things it can do it just
10377200	10382480	has to beat all of the time so that so you would say that the heart is not conscious whereas the
10382480	10388640	the upper plane is conscious yes yes I would yes yes yeah that's a good one I hadn't thought about that
10388640	10396160	yeah yeah that's right sorted that one um I mean yeah you know I mean you know I think there are
10396160	10400960	interesting issues of different levels you know planes or levels of consciousness you know there's
10400960	10408080	minimal selfhood um and then if it's the case that sort of consciousness as a process entails
10408080	10412560	some kind of action you have to now think about sort of what is action on the inside what is
10412560	10418560	mental action and then what what normally what ends up doing is thinking in terms of attention and the
10418560	10424080	the kind of routing and selection the smart data sampling but now not by moving my eyes or by
10425520	10432880	going to the right wikipedia page but by basically switching on and off various sources of input from
10432880	10437440	lower in the hierarchy so you know I repeat from the point of view of psychology that would be like
10437440	10442640	endogenous attention so that would be the mental action that makes it conscious processing
10443840	10450560	and then you have to ask well at what point is that you know is that necessary to actually
10450560	10456160	experience anything and I think I think you probably there are people who argue yes that is
10456160	10462960	actually a prerequisite for a qualitative experience so you have to be able to select it
10462960	10468240	what does that mean you have to be able to attend to it and you have to be the source of that sort
10468240	10473200	of enabling attention that active sampling inside the brain so now there's a deep link between
10473920	10480240	qualia or qualitative experience and attention and conscious processing that of the kind that
10480240	10487520	is accompanied by qualitative experience I think is important it also interestingly also speaks to
10487520	10492800	your dynamic Markov blankets because of course by switching off and selecting various bits of
10493840	10499520	neuronal message passing in the brain you're reconfiguring your Markov blanket out though
10499520	10505600	some somebody's Markov blanket lower down which is an interesting an interesting notion but
10506560	10514800	it that also fits comfortably with Thomas Metzinger's and Vanya's advice's formulations
10515600	10519920	I actually Yakov Linsky as well formulations of
10521760	10528640	phenology in the context of transparency and opacity that you know what what renders something
10528640	10536000	opaque in the sense oh I see now if you like as a projection on a murky window
10536960	10541200	it's not just going straight into it's not direct perception it's it's your it's now
10541200	10546640	something I am looking at oh I'm looking at a red apple and it may well be exactly this
10546640	10552960	controllability the fact you can attend or disignore it so I think there's a nice link there
10553040	10558160	from the from the point of view of certain philosophical takes on self-modeling and
10560000	10566480	phenomenological transparency and opacity and the mechanics of belief updating when it comes to
10566480	10573280	selection through basically a getting the Kalman gain right or you know doing the root getting the
10573280	10578960	routine right same exactly the same mechanism you get in transformers so they call it attention
10578960	10584800	it's just basically a waiting in that context it's a waiting that inherits or is inferred from
10584800	10588880	something in the past a pattern in the past but if it if that waiting comes from higher
10589760	10594320	in abstract hierarchical model that would look very much like in Dodger's attention
10594320	10599920	and it starts to have the look and feel of a mental action that would you know bring you
10599920	10606560	closer to it but whether you would know that you were deploying attention and whether you
10606560	10610800	could tell somebody else oh I've got a qualitative experience or whether you become a philosopher
10610800	10614640	as well your life puzzling about the fact that I can tell somebody else I'm having a qualitative
10614640	10620080	experience there's the different planes I think you'd have to you'd have to contend with beautiful
10620080	10624400	beautiful do you have any final thought I mean we've got a machine learning audience so any calls
10624400	10631200	to action how can they start looking at active inference where should they look and what would
10631200	10637840	you like to tell them I was very charming of you I'm not going to tell them anything I'm just
10640320	10646080	if it's if it's the right kind of approach that you know it'll already be out there it'll be
10646080	10650080	self-evident it's just a question I think of people finding their own language and their own
10650640	10659120	their own rhetoric or calculus that makes sense of it and the other reason I'm not going to say
10659120	10664800	anything is I've spoken far too much and I'm trying to be a recluse and the more I'm calling
10664800	10670400	people to my work the less easy it is to be a recluse yes indeed uh professor Carl Frister
10670400	10676400	that's been an absolute honor thank you so much for joining us thank you thank you very much okay
10676400	10680960	this is just a bit of a note from me at the end of the podcast thank you so much for supporting
10680960	10686560	all the stuff that we're doing it means so much to me um we have a patreon if you would like to
10686560	10691840	support us personally if you're touched by the work that we do um also I'd really appreciate it
10691840	10697760	if you could give us a rating on your podcast app um I actually discovered the other day I couldn't
10697760	10704720	quite believe this but on Spotify we are the top rated AI podcast for active AI podcast um yeah it's
10704720	10710400	incredible so thank you so much for those of you who have rated us um unfortunately on apple
10710400	10716160	podcast the learning rate is only 0.01 so it hasn't quite caught up uh with the fact that we're the
10716160	10721520	best AI podcast yet so particularly on on apple podcast if you could give us a five star rating
10721520	10727920	and and a review I think that will accelerate the learning process um yeah other than that if you're
10727920	10734080	on youtube most of you aren't subscribed um of course youtube has recently changed its modus operandi
10734080	10739040	it's less of a subscription chronological model and it's more of a magical algorithm model so I
10739040	10743520	guess it doesn't matter so much but just from a just from a metrics point of view it would really
10743520	10748800	help us out if you hit the subscribe button uh we have an active discord community as well
10748800	10753360	so check us out on there and yeah I just wanted to say one more time thank you so much for all
10753360	10758560	of your support it means so much to us and uh plenty more content like this coming your way soon
10759440	10762880	cheers see you on the next one
