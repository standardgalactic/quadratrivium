WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
and I should look into your eyes.

00:02.280 --> 00:04.320
A bit of a bit of a combo.

00:04.320 --> 00:07.680
So yeah, like that camera vaguely in my direction.

00:07.680 --> 00:09.120
I don't think it matters.

00:09.120 --> 00:10.880
OK, just don't look down.

00:10.880 --> 00:15.600
OK, don't look down because of the glasses and the light.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.600
Oh, yeah, let me check that.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.840
Tiny bit sort of, but when I say source,

00:20.840 --> 00:24.360
the only light source.

00:24.360 --> 00:28.120
So I'm director of product for R&D Adversus.

00:28.200 --> 00:32.560
And I'm also a student in PhD for cognitive computing

00:32.560 --> 00:35.560
at the University of Quebec in Montreal.

00:35.560 --> 00:36.760
Fantastic.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.000
So what have we just been discussing?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.760
God, we've been discussing a lot of things.

00:41.760 --> 00:44.960
I think we discussed panpsychism most recently.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.720
We discussed computationalism.

00:46.720 --> 00:51.080
We discussed whether we should be focused on materiality

00:51.080 --> 00:53.400
or whether it's about the processes themselves,

00:53.400 --> 00:57.360
the hard problem, IIT, lots of things, lots of things.

00:57.400 --> 00:58.880
Yeah, so why don't we start with the beginning?

00:58.880 --> 01:00.480
So that's quite a good segue, actually.

01:00.480 --> 01:04.880
So recently there was this letter of opposition

01:04.880 --> 01:07.600
around integrated information theory.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.960
What's your take on that?

01:10.960 --> 01:13.360
I think the reaction was to be expected.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.840
I think you can't ask people that aren't

01:15.840 --> 01:18.840
involved in a process which is aimed at determining

01:18.840 --> 01:23.520
whether they are right or wrong just to accept

01:23.520 --> 01:26.520
the outcomes of something in which they had no say.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.120
So there's that.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.440
It's like saying, well, you're going

01:28.440 --> 01:32.560
to have to accept the outcome of elections, but you can't vote.

01:32.560 --> 01:37.440
I think one of the issues is the people who created the study

01:37.440 --> 01:40.520
determined a process that left too much room, too much wiggle

01:40.520 --> 01:42.560
room for interpretation and critique,

01:42.560 --> 01:44.400
which means there's a problem in the study design

01:44.400 --> 01:46.320
to begin with.

01:46.320 --> 01:50.720
I think when you start attacking through adversarial means

01:50.720 --> 01:54.720
a field, it is highly likely the field is going to retaliate.

01:54.760 --> 01:59.880
So this open letter, I think, was a retaliatory move.

01:59.880 --> 02:03.040
I think it was a very strong response

02:03.040 --> 02:07.840
to perhaps coverage that should have been more nuanced.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.960
I definitely don't think IIT is the leading

02:09.960 --> 02:11.520
consciousness theory.

02:11.520 --> 02:12.960
I think it's an interesting one.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.160
I think it has promise.

02:14.160 --> 02:16.400
I think it's definitely formal.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.880
There are many others.

02:17.880 --> 02:21.080
I think this one was just one of the ones that was selected

02:21.080 --> 02:22.560
in the Templeton study.

02:22.560 --> 02:26.680
And so I think we need to be more careful about how we comport

02:26.680 --> 02:29.040
ourselves towards other scientists.

02:29.040 --> 02:33.280
When we call an entire field pseudoscience,

02:33.280 --> 02:34.920
I don't think it helps.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.440
I think we can critique the parts of the field

02:37.440 --> 02:42.640
we think are egregious or problematic.

02:42.640 --> 02:46.040
I think that's helpful because it builds towards something

02:46.040 --> 02:49.560
rather than just destroying something for which a lot of people

02:49.560 --> 02:51.640
have given their lives.

02:52.280 --> 02:55.040
Not through death, but they've given a lot of their time.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.040
They've studied.

02:56.040 --> 03:00.040
They've understood what would constitute the right kind

03:00.040 --> 03:01.840
of methodology, and they've applied it.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.680
So I don't think we can just disqualify it

03:03.680 --> 03:06.560
as something that has no value offhand.

03:06.560 --> 03:08.720
Now, it's not to say that they necessarily all

03:08.720 --> 03:14.280
had an offhand opinion, but the way it was presented

03:14.280 --> 03:20.240
basically suggested because of tabloid style reporting,

03:20.760 --> 03:22.600
we're leaning towards something dangerous,

03:22.600 --> 03:26.800
and to do so, they used tabloid-styled methods.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.840
That's my take.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.360
Do you think there is any bright line between what

03:31.360 --> 03:33.840
is legitimate science and what isn't?

03:33.840 --> 03:35.680
I think there might be, but I don't think

03:35.680 --> 03:37.360
it's where people think it is.

03:37.360 --> 03:44.400
I think, for instance, some people called science something

03:44.400 --> 03:45.760
that used tools.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.800
And I think, to me, that's insufficient to qualify as science.

03:48.800 --> 03:53.640
So it's not because you use a little pinny machine

03:53.640 --> 03:55.760
to go like this on somebody's head,

03:55.760 --> 03:58.160
that phrenology is effectively a science.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.280
That's not.

03:59.280 --> 04:03.640
I think you need to measure invariance

04:03.640 --> 04:06.160
and measure how those invariance allow you

04:06.160 --> 04:07.680
some degree of predictability.

04:07.680 --> 04:13.840
To me, that's the essence of science.

04:13.880 --> 04:18.560
But I also think that some things that people

04:18.560 --> 04:22.640
can discard as evidence still can qualify as evidence.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.800
To me, phenomenology can become a part of evidence.

04:25.800 --> 04:29.480
To me, intersectional data, which

04:29.480 --> 04:32.320
means it's not necessarily data that will easily reproduce,

04:32.320 --> 04:36.600
can qualify as data under the caveats,

04:36.600 --> 04:38.800
that it is not something that would reproduce,

04:38.800 --> 04:41.680
that it is something that is specific to a perspective

04:41.680 --> 04:44.440
and therefore cannot qualify as a generalizer.

04:44.440 --> 04:48.000
I think a lot of qualitative methods

04:48.000 --> 04:52.280
have developed entire frameworks to explain how

04:52.280 --> 04:55.280
to interpret what they measured as data.

04:55.280 --> 04:58.360
And oftentimes, because people in the STEM fields

04:58.360 --> 05:01.960
are not aware of how this interpretation is

05:01.960 --> 05:05.200
meant to be taken, they just see something which

05:05.200 --> 05:06.520
doesn't seem very systematic.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.080
And they're like, well, that's not data.

05:08.080 --> 05:11.440
I was like, well, OK, to your measurement,

05:11.440 --> 05:12.480
that's not data.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.200
Because there is no way for what you're

05:14.200 --> 05:17.880
using to interpret that in any sort of systematized way.

05:17.880 --> 05:18.880
Sure.

05:18.880 --> 05:23.880
But for someone who understands how to generate that data,

05:23.880 --> 05:27.160
how to potentially return to the space which

05:27.160 --> 05:32.160
has similar partitions, and how to turn this

05:32.160 --> 05:35.160
into something which becomes a little more systematic,

05:35.160 --> 05:38.560
like thematic analysis.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.960
And let's say, interjudge agreement.

05:41.960 --> 05:45.000
Then we get to something that resembles systematicity,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.600
and therefore we can derive patterns from there.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.720
So I think the line is not as bright as people would like

05:51.720 --> 05:53.680
to think, but it does exist.

05:53.680 --> 05:57.280
Yeah, I like your notion of systematicity.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.640
Because I suppose you could just argue

05:59.640 --> 06:02.160
on some kind of just basic utility.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.800
You mentioned phrenology.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.120
And there was this horrific gaydar paper a few years ago.

06:07.120 --> 06:10.000
I don't know if you remember, where they ingested

06:10.000 --> 06:12.680
a whole bunch of images from dating websites.

06:12.680 --> 06:16.000
And they trained it to predict whether you were gay or not.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.200
And it was from Stanford.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.600
And the same Stanford researcher recently

06:20.600 --> 06:24.520
published a paper about theory of mind and language models.

06:24.520 --> 06:25.880
That's an interesting aside.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.560
But anyway, that's something which is ethically ridiculous.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.120
And there are all sorts of confounding factors and so on.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.600
But they might argue, well, this is science

06:33.600 --> 06:35.080
because it has predictive power.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.520
Well, what part of it was science?

06:39.520 --> 06:41.320
Like, what model did it allow us?

06:41.320 --> 06:42.960
What understanding did it allow us?

06:42.960 --> 06:47.640
Did the AI have predictive power, or did we?

06:47.640 --> 06:49.680
And under what circumstances?

06:49.680 --> 06:52.400
Like, did it predict very accurately

06:52.400 --> 06:53.680
whether someone was gay or not?

06:53.680 --> 06:54.280
I don't know.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.400
But you could tell me whether, yes, it did or not.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.280
But what does that tell us about the world?

06:58.280 --> 07:01.320
Does it tell us that there's a context under which certain sets

07:01.320 --> 07:04.800
of features are common for a given population?

07:04.840 --> 07:07.240
Possibly, but I still don't know what those features are.

07:07.240 --> 07:08.960
It didn't really help me.

07:08.960 --> 07:12.840
And then the idea that we can turn certain kinds of studies

07:12.840 --> 07:17.600
in practice, I think, is not beyond the scope of science.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.520
That's not really it.

07:18.520 --> 07:23.920
But I think it requires the scientists

07:23.920 --> 07:26.800
to take a stance before the scientific experiment

07:26.800 --> 07:29.600
to say, these are the outcomes I believe

07:29.600 --> 07:31.600
should be put out into the world.

07:31.600 --> 07:35.880
And therefore, this is what I choose to reify with my science.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.920
And also, the kinds of methods I'm

07:37.920 --> 07:40.800
going to use are themselves anchored

07:40.800 --> 07:42.920
in some kind of contextuality, right?

07:42.920 --> 07:46.960
Like, the idea of breaking apart the world

07:46.960 --> 07:50.200
into certain kinds of categories which are laden.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.800
And I'm going to measure those categories

07:52.800 --> 07:55.000
with certain kinds of things, like IQ tests.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.280
It's quite controversial, right?

07:58.280 --> 08:00.800
It's like, do they measure intelligence?

08:00.800 --> 08:04.040
Or do they measure a certain kind of aptitude

08:04.040 --> 08:06.680
given a certain kind of context?

08:06.680 --> 08:08.920
Like, maybe?

08:08.920 --> 08:12.600
And also, what do we mean when we say intelligence?

08:12.600 --> 08:15.160
Like, are we saying some people, therefore, are not,

08:15.160 --> 08:18.440
and therefore, X, Y, Z?

08:18.440 --> 08:23.760
So I think that doesn't make it phrenology, though.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.040
That still could become science.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.080
And in the case of the AI model,

08:29.080 --> 08:32.120
if it had accuracy given that, it probably did.

08:32.120 --> 08:38.160
But I don't think that tells me anything about a causal factor

08:38.160 --> 08:41.360
that I could then derive and build upon, right?

08:41.360 --> 08:43.680
Like, it doesn't really help.

08:43.680 --> 08:44.720
Yeah, no, it's interesting.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.880
I mean, the whole endeavor of science

08:47.880 --> 08:49.920
is something that fascinates me.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.240
And once you get past the question, of course, of, you know,

08:52.240 --> 08:54.160
well, what makes good science?

08:54.160 --> 08:57.400
Chomsky, by the way, says that language models are not

08:57.400 --> 09:01.360
the theory of language, because they basically, you know,

09:01.360 --> 09:02.720
they can recognize anything.

09:02.720 --> 09:04.640
You can just put noise into a language model

09:04.640 --> 09:05.640
and it will recognize it.

09:05.640 --> 09:09.000
So it doesn't really say anything about the why

09:09.000 --> 09:11.840
and the what would happen if not question.

09:11.840 --> 09:15.080
It just, you know, it just models absolutely everything.

09:15.080 --> 09:18.760
So science needs to kind of create clear dividing lines

09:18.760 --> 09:21.040
between what things are and what things are not

09:21.040 --> 09:22.000
and why they happen.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.800
Yeah, so I think I just think we have to be careful when we say

09:26.800 --> 09:28.440
what things are and what things are not.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.880
I think it's always relative to something else.

09:30.880 --> 09:34.720
Like, I think it's true that you can put language

09:34.720 --> 09:37.160
in a language model and it will do something.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.840
But will it do what you wanted it to do?

09:39.840 --> 09:40.960
I'm not sure.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.960
So in the case of Chomsky, I don't think he's wrong.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.960
I just think that in general, what we mean by language,

09:45.960 --> 09:48.680
we don't just mean a way to transmit

09:48.720 --> 09:52.160
semantics, I think we mean a way to transmit semantics

09:52.160 --> 09:55.000
which are anchored into something for which we expect

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
a certain kind of outcome to also follow.

10:00.360 --> 10:03.400
Because if both you and I mean blue butterfly,

10:03.400 --> 10:07.400
but we don't mean the same like referent,

10:08.240 --> 10:09.080
then it's useless.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.920
That's not really language.

10:10.920 --> 10:14.920
We're not really like converging over anything.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.800
So I think that's the thing.

10:16.800 --> 10:20.000
Like the language models don't necessarily converge with us

10:20.000 --> 10:22.160
where we want them to converge.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.360
So in that sense, they're disconnected,

10:24.360 --> 10:28.840
but they do, to me and you, carry some semantics.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.680
And that's how we can tell that like,

10:31.680 --> 10:33.840
they're not doing what we thought they were gonna do there.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.080
They can get disaligned with us.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.280
So yeah, so again, things that they,

10:38.280 --> 10:40.080
what things are and what things are not

10:40.080 --> 10:42.880
is always relative to what we're doing.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.080
What we're not is always relative

10:45.080 --> 10:48.760
to some kind of perspective that frames it

10:48.760 --> 10:50.900
and constrains it for it to be at all.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.080
Yeah, I mean, because obviously we can get to the question

10:54.080 --> 10:57.960
of whether you think language is a system of thought

10:57.960 --> 10:59.640
or a system of communication.

10:59.640 --> 11:00.920
But I kind of agree with what you're saying

11:00.920 --> 11:04.520
about language models, which is that essentially

11:04.520 --> 11:07.560
they are spitting out words, which means something to us.

11:07.560 --> 11:10.240
And we can discuss where that intrinsic meaning comes from

11:10.240 --> 11:13.000
whether it's pragmatics or whether it's just

11:13.000 --> 11:16.440
some kind of colloquial usage of the word or whatever.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.040
I mean, what's your take on the first question,

11:19.040 --> 11:21.160
which is, do you think language evolved

11:21.160 --> 11:23.280
as a communication or thinking mechanism?

11:26.560 --> 11:28.120
I think we're baking in the definition

11:28.120 --> 11:31.200
when we ask for either like, is language something

11:31.200 --> 11:35.720
that is simply a reference between some kind of cluster

11:35.720 --> 11:38.440
and some kind of real thing, is that language

11:38.440 --> 11:42.640
or does it have to be something which is externalized

11:42.640 --> 11:47.640
as a symbol, in which case, then it's purely communication?

11:47.640 --> 11:51.080
So whether I think we have to be more clear

11:51.080 --> 11:53.200
about what we mean, because I do think

11:53.200 --> 11:57.360
that you don't need to externalize what you understood

11:57.360 --> 11:58.960
in order to cluster it.

11:58.960 --> 12:02.240
It's better, it allows you to confirm and act on it.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.000
And especially if there are more agents around you,

12:05.040 --> 12:08.760
I think it makes thinking much more efficient.

12:08.760 --> 12:12.480
So I think if we went all the way down,

12:12.480 --> 12:15.680
I think we'd find that maybe the egg or chicken problem,

12:15.680 --> 12:17.440
like we could solve it sort of,

12:17.440 --> 12:20.880
I think at the layers at which we would recognize something

12:20.880 --> 12:22.760
that resembles thought or resembles language,

12:22.760 --> 12:24.200
they're no longer separate.

12:25.600 --> 12:30.600
But if we cast language as a system of reference

12:31.600 --> 12:36.600
and reference, then I don't think you need communication

12:38.240 --> 12:42.800
for that, you just need one entity to recognize something

12:42.800 --> 12:46.800
and be able to keep that as something

12:46.800 --> 12:48.320
it can refer back to later.

12:48.320 --> 12:50.080
So it it towards itself,

12:50.080 --> 12:52.840
but that also could be qualified as communication,

12:52.840 --> 12:55.920
communication over time with yourself, right?

12:55.920 --> 12:57.560
You cash something out,

12:57.560 --> 12:59.920
which you will pull back again afterwards.

12:59.920 --> 13:04.120
So whether it's spatial or temporal or spatiotemporal,

13:04.120 --> 13:06.960
I think, is the real question we're asking here.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.080
Okay, okay, interesting.

13:08.080 --> 13:12.800
But I think that you can embed thinking inside language.

13:12.800 --> 13:16.600
I mean, for example, like if you're writing software,

13:16.600 --> 13:18.480
there are design patterns

13:18.480 --> 13:20.960
and there are patterns for doing lots of different things

13:20.960 --> 13:22.240
and we give them names

13:22.240 --> 13:24.760
and then the developers recognize those patterns

13:24.760 --> 13:27.080
in the software and they say, oh, I understand now.

13:27.080 --> 13:30.040
And loads and loads of these thinking primitives,

13:30.040 --> 13:33.280
I think are kind of culturally embedded in our language

13:33.280 --> 13:35.200
and they're like memes

13:35.200 --> 13:37.600
and they get passed through generation

13:37.600 --> 13:39.360
and we just point to those things

13:39.360 --> 13:40.720
and then we link them

13:40.720 --> 13:43.960
to those kind of cognitive programs that we have.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.640
The fidelity of that mapping, of course,

13:45.640 --> 13:48.000
whether it's mediated or whether it's a simulacrum,

13:48.000 --> 13:49.240
we can discuss that.

13:50.760 --> 13:52.440
Okay, I don't disagree.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.960
Yeah, I think you're right.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.600
I think you tapped into this idea of whether

13:59.640 --> 14:03.240
this is thought or does it require a name?

14:03.240 --> 14:05.640
Would the pattern exist without the name

14:05.640 --> 14:08.000
and would it be referable without the name?

14:08.000 --> 14:09.520
Could we still point to it?

14:09.520 --> 14:14.520
And then if we think of sign language,

14:16.200 --> 14:18.800
what qualifies as a symbol in sign language

14:18.800 --> 14:22.040
is it a reliable action

14:22.080 --> 14:24.680
that follows something else?

14:24.680 --> 14:26.400
Is it this intermediate?

14:26.400 --> 14:30.680
And in this case, what qualifies as an intermediate

14:30.680 --> 14:34.120
or intermediary when you're pointing at something?

14:34.120 --> 14:37.800
So is it the fact that I look at you, you look at me,

14:37.800 --> 14:39.280
I know you're waiting for something,

14:39.280 --> 14:40.560
so I'm gonna point to the thing

14:40.560 --> 14:42.120
and you're gonna make that connection as well.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.320
Is that language?

14:43.320 --> 14:45.480
I would argue, yeah, it is language.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.560
And that's why I think animals, to some extent,

14:47.560 --> 14:49.040
a lot of them have language.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.360
If they're capable of transmitting information

14:51.400 --> 14:53.280
through themselves as intermediaries.

14:54.720 --> 14:58.400
And again, do you do this with yourself

14:58.400 --> 15:03.080
without having to use what we would qualify as words?

15:03.080 --> 15:07.720
I think words are just reliable intermediate clusters

15:07.720 --> 15:08.920
and whatever those are.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.240
Yeah, no, I completely agree.

15:10.240 --> 15:13.000
So yeah, first of all, I think when we say language,

15:13.000 --> 15:15.840
people assume that we're talking about words.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.240
And as you rightly said,

15:18.240 --> 15:20.080
just imagine a hypothetical situation,

15:20.080 --> 15:22.400
you were born unable to make any sounds,

15:22.400 --> 15:23.720
you didn't have a mouth

15:23.720 --> 15:26.480
and you could only write with a pen.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.880
You would still be every bit as capable as any other human

15:28.880 --> 15:31.120
or perhaps you could only use sign language.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.760
And then you could say, well,

15:32.760 --> 15:34.720
does sign language have the representation

15:34.720 --> 15:36.480
or fidelity or cardinality of language?

15:36.480 --> 15:38.040
Yes, it does, absolutely it does.

15:38.040 --> 15:41.880
So language isn't so much about the cardinality of,

15:41.880 --> 15:44.480
I mean, language is just basically a set of strings,

15:44.480 --> 15:47.080
by the way, so how much can you represent?

15:47.080 --> 15:50.000
But anyway, I think it's about

15:50.000 --> 15:52.440
kind of social complexification in our brains.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.120
And even the ability to write

15:55.120 --> 15:56.560
is quite an interesting example of that.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.840
So this is a proto-ability that we've learned

15:58.840 --> 16:03.120
and you mentioned animals and animals don't have the ability

16:03.120 --> 16:06.600
to, you know, they don't have the flexibility that we have.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.400
So they don't have the ability to map symbols

16:09.400 --> 16:11.280
to a variety of different phenomena.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.040
They do map some symbols to phenomena,

16:13.040 --> 16:15.200
but that seems to be much more hardwired.

16:15.200 --> 16:18.760
Whereas with humans, it's very, very flexible.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.800
And it's a real mystery and unfortunately,

16:20.800 --> 16:22.880
we don't have the phylogenetic record,

16:22.880 --> 16:24.960
the intermediate record of how and why

16:24.960 --> 16:27.920
that capability developed, but it did develop in humans.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.480
So I can't speak as to why it develops

16:33.480 --> 16:35.280
in humans and not in animals.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.640
I think what we can talk about is

16:39.640 --> 16:42.520
what qualifies something as a language

16:42.520 --> 16:45.760
if it's not the words, the sounds, the writing

16:45.760 --> 16:50.160
or the signs, I think we're talking about a process

16:50.160 --> 16:54.440
which is it's degree of rigidity on a certain scale.

16:55.400 --> 16:58.640
So when you and I use words,

16:58.640 --> 17:01.680
there's a very high likelihood that we refer to

17:01.680 --> 17:06.160
some similar abstractness that can be contained, right?

17:06.160 --> 17:07.960
Under some kind of market blanket.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
Whereas the porosity of me kind of pointing over there,

17:13.200 --> 17:14.560
that could mean a lot of things.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.400
Like I haven't really reduced entropy.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.320
Like given a context, there's a possibility

17:19.320 --> 17:20.720
that we would reduce it, right?

17:20.720 --> 17:23.640
And that's precisely the sociality you're talking about.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.040
We're talking about these scripts

17:25.040 --> 17:28.320
that basically constrain, constrain, constrain, constrain.

17:28.320 --> 17:29.600
And then within those constraints,

17:29.600 --> 17:34.480
there are a lot of different kinds of signals

17:34.520 --> 17:38.960
that have come to take on a reliable meaning.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.000
And we're so expressive

17:41.000 --> 17:42.760
because we have so many of these symbols

17:42.760 --> 17:44.080
and we can compose them.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.360
So there's different scales, right?

17:45.360 --> 17:48.680
So if I say the word trout,

17:48.680 --> 17:50.320
I'm not sure you know what I mean here.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.480
Like why trout?

17:51.480 --> 17:52.400
What are you trying to say?

17:52.400 --> 17:53.520
But if I add more words,

17:53.520 --> 17:56.200
then suddenly I've also added more context to trout.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.320
So I've contained, constrained

17:58.320 --> 18:00.760
and now suddenly scales of meaning arise.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.280
We have more priors, more priors

18:02.280 --> 18:05.040
and now trout takes on a whole other meaning.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.800
But if I kept pointing,

18:06.800 --> 18:08.880
I don't think there'd be lots of information

18:08.880 --> 18:12.080
that's contained here until maybe I do the thing for you

18:12.080 --> 18:14.520
and now you'll know maybe that if I point over there,

18:14.520 --> 18:15.720
that's what I mean.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.480
Yeah, yeah, fascinating.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.280
You mentioned intelligence before, by the way.

18:20.280 --> 18:23.000
So what's your take on intelligence?

18:23.000 --> 18:26.200
To me, intelligence doesn't start

18:26.200 --> 18:27.520
as fundamentally human, right?

18:27.520 --> 18:28.400
So we start for that.

18:28.400 --> 18:31.080
Like to me, intelligence is a type of process.

18:31.120 --> 18:36.120
It's the capacity to derive as many paths

18:36.120 --> 18:38.200
between two points as possible.

18:39.800 --> 18:43.360
Because it entails that you can compute those paths, right?

18:43.360 --> 18:46.260
So your capacity to compute them is one thing.

18:47.600 --> 18:50.120
And the precision with which you'll be able

18:50.120 --> 18:50.960
to reach the point, right?

18:50.960 --> 18:52.840
You could think you're computing the paths,

18:52.840 --> 18:54.160
but you could be wrong.

18:54.160 --> 18:56.240
You could actually get to a way different point.

18:56.240 --> 18:59.040
So I don't think that would qualify as intelligence.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.520
Intelligence is both your capacity

19:01.520 --> 19:03.480
to reach accurately the point,

19:03.480 --> 19:06.040
but also to reach it through a variety of means

19:06.040 --> 19:08.320
that you can entertain at a given time.

19:10.280 --> 19:13.680
So on that, and we'll talk about goals in a minute,

19:13.680 --> 19:15.560
but let's say a goal is an end state.

19:15.560 --> 19:16.960
So there's a state action space

19:16.960 --> 19:19.040
and we're traversing through the space.

19:19.040 --> 19:22.520
And then we look at the cone pattern of traversal

19:22.520 --> 19:25.960
and the shape of that cone tells us a lot about intelligence.

19:25.960 --> 19:30.040
So the cone might incorporate future affordances

19:30.040 --> 19:32.360
which are not yet available to us.

19:33.480 --> 19:37.240
They might include, maybe there's some kind of a cost function

19:37.240 --> 19:39.960
because some affordances are harder to take than others,

19:39.960 --> 19:42.120
both because of physical difficulty

19:42.120 --> 19:44.120
and intellectual difficulty.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.200
So you're saying there's some kind of utility function

19:46.200 --> 19:47.880
that we can sum over all of those trajectories

19:47.880 --> 19:49.560
to tell us how intelligent we are.

19:50.760 --> 19:51.720
Yeah, I think so.

19:51.720 --> 19:55.040
I think it's not necessarily also your capacity

19:55.120 --> 19:56.360
to enact them, right?

19:56.360 --> 19:59.560
I think, because if it was your capacity to enact them,

19:59.560 --> 20:01.840
anybody disempowered would not be very intelligent

20:01.840 --> 20:02.800
and that's not true.

20:02.800 --> 20:03.760
That's not true.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.320
They could compute it and be like,

20:05.320 --> 20:08.480
well, I mean, I can see that if I were in that position

20:08.480 --> 20:13.080
I would be able to or I can see that this is a path

20:13.080 --> 20:15.600
that exists, but there's something in the way.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.440
Like I can't go there.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.080
That path exists nonetheless.

20:19.080 --> 20:21.160
Like I know I can go outside right now

20:21.160 --> 20:22.840
but all the doors are closed.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.840
So I know I could try to find a way to open the door

20:25.840 --> 20:29.320
but eventually the cost for me to get outside

20:29.320 --> 20:31.560
would be so high I would effectively dissolve

20:31.560 --> 20:32.720
so there's no point.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.080
So I might as well just not do it.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.200
The likelihood of me actually taking that path

20:36.200 --> 20:37.840
is really low because I'm disempowered.

20:37.840 --> 20:38.960
I'm not less intelligent.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.200
I found a way.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.640
I found a highly improbable way.

20:42.640 --> 20:44.840
I just don't think I should do it.

20:44.840 --> 20:49.840
So I think intelligence generally correlates

20:50.360 --> 20:52.080
with your capacity to reach those goals

20:52.080 --> 20:54.040
and therefore accrue more resources

20:54.040 --> 20:58.760
because you'll be able to find ways to get towards places

20:58.760 --> 21:00.560
which are self-evidencing.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.680
And that also has a self-reinforcing cycle

21:03.680 --> 21:07.000
where the more likely you are to accrue to resources,

21:07.000 --> 21:08.800
the more likely you are to find more paths

21:08.800 --> 21:10.480
that lead you to more goals, et cetera.

21:10.480 --> 21:14.240
And then maybe if you can stop thinking

21:14.240 --> 21:17.200
about the lower level paths you have to take

21:17.200 --> 21:18.800
then you could compute larger scales

21:18.800 --> 21:22.000
and you can become more effective on a, again,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.080
grander scale so you can start influencing more people.

21:24.080 --> 21:28.200
You can start thinking in terms of longer time depth

21:29.080 --> 21:31.880
whereas if you're constantly trying to survive,

21:31.880 --> 21:36.560
like everything's constantly hitting you from everywhere

21:36.560 --> 21:38.360
then you have to compute all the paths

21:38.360 --> 21:39.840
to avoid all those things.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.560
So again, privilege plays into the degree to which

21:42.560 --> 21:44.680
your intellect can expand, right?

21:44.680 --> 21:47.880
Or at least expand in terms of empowerment.

21:47.920 --> 21:50.200
But that's not to say you're not intelligence.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.040
It just means that your intelligence

21:52.040 --> 21:54.320
gets carried and echoed in the world.

21:54.320 --> 21:56.760
And then there's all the social stuff, right?

21:56.760 --> 21:58.760
Because you and I are constrained by socialness

21:58.760 --> 22:03.640
or by some degree of social scripts, we can compute more.

22:03.640 --> 22:07.320
We don't have to wonder how we should use that table.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.280
We don't have to wonder how I should use this mic.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.120
I know.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.080
So the more we have these,

22:13.920 --> 22:15.240
should you hold me to stop or?

22:15.240 --> 22:16.080
Carry on.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.880
The more we have these social signals

22:17.880 --> 22:19.720
that allow us to compute more,

22:20.840 --> 22:22.800
the more we can think on larger scales

22:22.800 --> 22:24.920
or deeper time depth.

22:24.920 --> 22:28.520
But sometimes I also think that some degree of constraints

22:28.520 --> 22:32.680
also sometimes preclude you from thinking

22:32.680 --> 22:35.840
that a potential path is probable.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.240
Yeah, yeah, I mean, there's a few things there.

22:37.240 --> 22:40.160
I mean, first of all, I quite like this idea

22:40.160 --> 22:45.160
that the length of the prediction horizon

22:45.640 --> 22:47.440
is a good indication of intelligence.

22:47.440 --> 22:51.040
But the only way that we can increase the prediction horizon

22:51.040 --> 22:54.440
is through creating very low resolution abstractions

22:54.440 --> 22:56.400
to represent our sense world.

22:56.400 --> 23:00.160
So that has a kind of brittleness associated with it.

23:00.160 --> 23:01.320
You said something interesting before,

23:01.320 --> 23:02.840
which is that you could think of it

23:02.840 --> 23:06.320
almost as overcoming adversity or overcoming cost,

23:06.320 --> 23:10.400
which like so some trajectories are going against the grain,

23:10.400 --> 23:13.240
but some choose to pursue those trajectories.

23:13.280 --> 23:16.200
And therefore you can think of them as more intelligent.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.160
Yeah, so it's quite interesting.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.480
I mean, I also like to zoom out

23:19.480 --> 23:22.280
and think of the actual goals themselves.

23:22.280 --> 23:27.000
Now, first of all, I think that goals are a system property.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.240
I don't think individual agents have goals.

23:29.240 --> 23:32.520
So I'm not sure it makes sense for an agent

23:32.520 --> 23:36.360
to pursue a goal, but let's just as a best faith argument,

23:36.360 --> 23:38.680
take a goal as a future state,

23:38.680 --> 23:41.120
which an agent is aware of.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.600
I would also factor in the utility of those goals

23:44.600 --> 23:45.920
and the selection of those goals

23:45.920 --> 23:47.640
as being parts of intelligence.

23:47.640 --> 23:50.360
Yeah, so again, I mean, you said something interesting.

23:50.360 --> 23:51.560
It's a property of the system.

23:51.560 --> 23:56.120
And I think if we take what I said at faith,

23:56.120 --> 23:57.720
intelligence is a property of the system,

23:57.720 --> 23:59.320
not just the individual, right?

23:59.320 --> 24:01.200
Because again, you get carried

24:01.200 --> 24:03.720
given that the system props you somehow

24:03.720 --> 24:07.760
and gives you capacities to think farther.

24:07.760 --> 24:10.080
So given that you and I are in the same system

24:10.120 --> 24:13.200
and have the same relationship to the system,

24:13.200 --> 24:15.160
we could quantify or intellect,

24:15.160 --> 24:18.760
given how far mine would go relative to yours.

24:18.760 --> 24:21.600
But that's only given that we have the same relationship

24:21.600 --> 24:24.800
to the system, which is again, highly unlikely.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.480
You would have to basically be a twin

24:26.480 --> 24:28.200
with practically in similar life

24:28.200 --> 24:30.400
to have the same relationship to the system.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.800
And then again, I mean, this idea of goal with utility,

24:34.800 --> 24:38.000
it's always relative to a scale, right?

24:38.000 --> 24:42.240
So given this scale, there's this gate,

24:42.240 --> 24:44.560
which is highly likely and this gate,

24:44.560 --> 24:45.920
which is slightly likely.

24:45.920 --> 24:48.240
And so I'm probably gonna go from here to here

24:48.240 --> 24:51.880
and how I get from here to here is the real question

24:51.880 --> 24:54.000
and the degree to which I minimize free energy

24:54.000 --> 24:57.920
by going from point to point and improve my model also

24:57.920 --> 24:59.040
by going from point to point,

24:59.040 --> 25:02.000
which is gonna allow me to reach the next goal

25:02.000 --> 25:03.600
without too much energy.

25:03.600 --> 25:07.200
So I don't think that someone taking a path

25:07.200 --> 25:09.520
against the grain is necessarily more,

25:09.520 --> 25:11.280
means that they're more intelligent.

25:11.280 --> 25:14.800
I think that if they can take an unlikely path,

25:14.800 --> 25:18.800
which also allows them to reach a goal

25:18.800 --> 25:20.320
that others would have wanted to reach

25:20.320 --> 25:22.560
and maybe couldn't or would do so

25:22.560 --> 25:26.680
with having to spend more energy at a given scale,

25:26.680 --> 25:29.180
means they're probably more intelligent.

25:29.180 --> 25:30.800
But it doesn't mean that if you follow the path,

25:30.800 --> 25:31.960
you're not more intelligent.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.760
Maybe this is the smoothest ride.

25:34.760 --> 25:37.960
Maybe there's no point in doing something different.

25:37.960 --> 25:42.560
Maybe to you, the goal is that simple.

25:42.560 --> 25:45.600
So you took the smoothest ride, that's very smart.

25:45.600 --> 25:49.280
You just also were able to compute many other paths

25:49.280 --> 25:50.760
to go there, you know?

25:50.760 --> 25:53.520
Yeah, but I think a goal in,

25:53.520 --> 25:57.320
because we were talking earlier about complex categories

25:57.320 --> 26:00.800
like a chair, it's very, very difficult to define a chair,

26:00.800 --> 26:02.800
and using the affordance is the way

26:02.800 --> 26:03.960
that most ontologists use.

26:04.160 --> 26:06.080
It's a thing you sit on or whatever.

26:06.080 --> 26:11.080
And a goal, we're not actually talking about a state,

26:11.280 --> 26:15.200
because if we represent the world in this systematic way

26:15.200 --> 26:17.680
where we discretize everything,

26:17.680 --> 26:19.680
then if you think about it,

26:19.680 --> 26:21.940
there would be an infinitude of goals.

26:21.940 --> 26:24.760
So we come up with an abstract notion of a goal,

26:24.760 --> 26:27.080
and now we've just got this big goal thing

26:27.080 --> 26:28.620
that we want to get to.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.960
And still there's an infinite number of trajectories

26:30.960 --> 26:32.680
that would reach an estate

26:32.680 --> 26:34.640
which satisfied that goal.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.960
So it just, it feels, I don't know,

26:36.960 --> 26:40.360
it feels kind of vague to me.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.360
To say goal?

26:42.320 --> 26:44.360
Yeah, well, I guess like,

26:44.360 --> 26:46.240
because we were talking earlier about science

26:46.240 --> 26:47.320
and the benefit of science,

26:47.320 --> 26:49.880
and I think like, you know,

26:49.880 --> 26:52.600
abduction is a key part of science,

26:52.600 --> 26:56.640
and abduction is about finding a reasonable explanation.

26:56.640 --> 26:59.280
So, you know, selecting out of the infinite set

26:59.320 --> 27:02.880
of hypotheses a reasonable set and mapping to them.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.280
And it's a similar thing with a goal, right?

27:05.280 --> 27:08.360
So what you're actually doing is you're,

27:08.360 --> 27:09.320
it's very creative.

27:09.320 --> 27:13.360
You're basically creating something from nothing.

27:13.360 --> 27:16.000
And you're saying, these three things

27:16.000 --> 27:17.640
seem very valuable to me.

27:17.640 --> 27:21.100
Now we know that we're talking about a multi-agent system.

27:21.100 --> 27:22.360
And the intelligence,

27:22.360 --> 27:24.440
and what you said really resonated with me,

27:24.440 --> 27:26.600
the intelligence arises at the system level.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.760
So the individual agent,

27:28.760 --> 27:31.000
I think the goals are not arbitrary,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.160
but not a million miles from arbitrary.

27:33.160 --> 27:35.920
But when you multiply that with many, many agents

27:35.920 --> 27:37.640
and a large collective intelligence,

27:37.640 --> 27:39.440
and you kind of average over the top,

27:39.440 --> 27:40.760
then you get these emergent goals

27:40.760 --> 27:42.320
and you get intelligent behavior.

27:42.320 --> 27:46.000
But it doesn't make sense to me to think of an individual agent

27:46.000 --> 27:49.560
as having any meaningful form of planning and reasoning.

27:51.080 --> 27:54.440
Well, I guess we're putting a lot in meaningful here,

27:54.440 --> 27:56.920
but as a thought experiment,

27:56.920 --> 28:01.920
I like to think of someone really, really, really smart

28:03.960 --> 28:07.160
who would compute like 3,000 years into the future.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.320
And you would think, like, well,

28:11.320 --> 28:14.600
that person would try, you know, solve world hunger

28:14.600 --> 28:17.360
and they would like, I don't know,

28:17.360 --> 28:20.880
they wouldn't try to take over the government.

28:20.880 --> 28:23.560
And, you know, they would find the path

28:23.560 --> 28:28.200
that makes sure that somehow they reach immortality

28:28.200 --> 28:30.960
and their children and something like that.

28:30.960 --> 28:35.360
And I'm like, I don't think so.

28:35.360 --> 28:38.680
I think someone really, really, really intelligent

28:39.760 --> 28:44.320
would probably be able to compute all the paths

28:44.320 --> 28:47.720
and find that they're already on the free energy

28:47.720 --> 28:50.200
minimization path and they would just, you know,

28:50.200 --> 28:52.240
live a very normal life.

28:52.240 --> 28:56.160
Like they would live the life they seem to have been set on

28:56.160 --> 28:58.320
and they would continue in that

28:58.320 --> 29:00.400
because they're part of a manifold

29:00.400 --> 29:04.160
and they're already part of a pool of negentropy

29:04.160 --> 29:07.880
and they're already like minimizing somehow.

29:07.880 --> 29:12.600
As Friston says, he argues there's something fundamental

29:12.600 --> 29:15.200
about, you know, if we talk about utility,

29:15.200 --> 29:17.280
for him, utility is existence.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.760
And there is an argument that some things

29:19.800 --> 29:23.960
are so fundamental, so platonic that they go about saying.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.840
So maybe it's existence.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.320
I'm not so sure about that.

29:27.320 --> 29:29.880
I still think that inside Friston's framework,

29:29.880 --> 29:33.680
there are still many potential ways to act and live.

29:33.680 --> 29:36.120
And the ex-risk people, they say,

29:36.120 --> 29:39.040
oh, obviously these agents are going to seek

29:39.040 --> 29:41.000
to maximize power.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.680
And well, why is it obviously?

29:42.680 --> 29:45.000
I'm not entirely sure.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.360
The agents as in the AIs?

29:47.360 --> 29:49.400
Yeah, the AIs.

29:49.440 --> 29:52.560
First of all, it's interesting that we're saying plural, right?

29:52.560 --> 29:54.120
Like in general, the...

29:54.120 --> 29:57.080
Well, for them actually, it's the one, right?

29:57.080 --> 30:00.360
They're still at the AI stage of there being one.

30:00.360 --> 30:01.200
Yeah, right?

30:01.200 --> 30:02.040
I know, it's so typical.

30:02.040 --> 30:06.880
That's only because they haven't got to the multi-scale yet.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.280
No, I know, but I think it speaks to something.

30:09.280 --> 30:13.080
It speaks to this notion of individuality

30:13.080 --> 30:14.400
and disconnection from the others.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.440
Whereas, no, intelligence is a function of your group,

30:17.440 --> 30:18.440
not just of yourself.

30:18.440 --> 30:20.000
The genius myth is a myth.

30:20.000 --> 30:23.480
They all collaborate and prosociality

30:23.480 --> 30:24.560
leads to something better.

30:24.560 --> 30:28.120
So I do think that should AIs take over,

30:28.120 --> 30:30.040
it won't be one, it'll be several,

30:30.040 --> 30:32.800
it'll be a group, like coalition or something.

30:32.800 --> 30:36.520
I'm interested in exploring various limiting factors

30:36.520 --> 30:38.920
or scaling laws for intelligence.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.360
And one of the big ones is knowing.

30:41.360 --> 30:42.760
And in a certain environment,

30:42.760 --> 30:46.960
there are only a finite number of things to know.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.280
And what you know might be related to the agents

30:49.280 --> 30:51.520
that you cohabit your environment with.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.800
But you did say earlier when we were having a discussion

30:53.800 --> 30:55.720
that you thought in principle

30:55.720 --> 30:58.480
that you could scale intelligence.

30:58.480 --> 31:02.200
And I actually like to rephrase what you just said.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.080
So you said when you zoom out

31:04.080 --> 31:07.680
and you're looking not at individual trajectory volumes,

31:07.680 --> 31:10.520
but you're looking at kind of like the adaptability

31:10.520 --> 31:13.880
of the entire super organism.

31:13.880 --> 31:16.680
Because that jives with the common definition

31:16.720 --> 31:19.200
of intelligence that is about adaptation, efficiency.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.240
And I really like that.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.240
But I guess I still want to say though

31:22.240 --> 31:25.520
that the X-Risk people think that there's a pure intelligence.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.000
So it's pure reason.

31:27.000 --> 31:31.120
It's not in any way constrained by material reality

31:31.120 --> 31:33.560
or like what we know.

31:33.560 --> 31:36.440
And I think, well, let's look at an ecosystem.

31:36.440 --> 31:41.440
And even if the agents had a perfect model of each other,

31:41.880 --> 31:45.080
and so there was a lot of complexification

31:45.080 --> 31:47.400
of the models of every single agent,

31:47.400 --> 31:49.520
surely there's a hard limit

31:49.520 --> 31:51.880
of how many time steps they could predict ahead.

31:52.880 --> 31:54.720
If that intelligence is pure,

31:54.720 --> 31:57.320
like not limited by materiality,

31:57.320 --> 31:58.480
like say it's not,

31:58.480 --> 32:01.080
it doesn't relate to land hours principle.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.800
It's not bound by quantum physics.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.480
Like is that what you mean?

32:05.440 --> 32:09.240
Well, let's say it were possible for an agent

32:09.240 --> 32:13.840
in a collective to predict many, many, many, many steps ahead.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.080
In order for that to happen,

32:15.080 --> 32:17.000
the agent would essentially need

32:17.000 --> 32:20.880
to have an internal simulation of the entire system.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.280
And maybe not the entire system

32:24.280 --> 32:27.080
because we're speaking about mediation and interfaces

32:27.080 --> 32:28.240
and affordances and so on.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.200
So there's still a lot of information hiding there.

32:30.200 --> 32:33.280
But let's say the agent had some holistic understanding

32:33.280 --> 32:34.400
of the entire system

32:34.400 --> 32:37.160
and could roll trajectories far into the future.

32:37.160 --> 32:39.440
So, but I guess my point though is that

32:39.440 --> 32:41.320
the agent wouldn't be intelligent.

32:41.320 --> 32:43.360
It would have memorized everything there is

32:43.360 --> 32:44.960
and know about that ecosystem.

32:47.120 --> 32:49.800
I don't think this time limit thing,

32:49.800 --> 32:53.680
I think you would just lose granularity.

32:53.680 --> 32:57.840
I think we have hierarchical models

32:57.840 --> 33:01.040
and if you extend this to infinity,

33:01.040 --> 33:06.040
there's a really sort of high level,

33:06.360 --> 33:09.000
practically near infinity state,

33:09.000 --> 33:10.520
which you can predict, right?

33:10.520 --> 33:12.480
There are constants to the universe.

33:12.600 --> 33:15.160
And so, while I can't tell what you're gonna be doing

33:15.160 --> 33:17.280
in 10 years with precision,

33:17.280 --> 33:19.640
I know there's a day you're gonna die.

33:19.640 --> 33:22.040
Like there's some constants that I can predict.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.520
You know, I know that likes it's gonna keep traveling

33:27.520 --> 33:29.160
until it no longer, you know,

33:29.160 --> 33:33.720
like there's a degree of granularity

33:33.720 --> 33:35.560
that can maintain accuracy,

33:35.560 --> 33:38.840
even if it loses out on precision.

33:38.840 --> 33:41.720
So that's probably one of the solutions.

33:41.760 --> 33:43.800
You would start losing out on granularity.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.000
So if you're asking me,

33:45.000 --> 33:48.480
can you continue predicting with the same level

33:48.480 --> 33:52.340
of both precision and accuracy across infinite time steps?

33:54.160 --> 33:56.660
I think if you're stable enough, yeah.

33:56.660 --> 33:59.100
So the question is really about the degree

33:59.100 --> 34:01.640
to which you have volatility in your system, right?

34:01.640 --> 34:04.480
Because if you and I just freeze in time,

34:04.480 --> 34:05.960
I mean, we're freezing time, that's it.

34:05.960 --> 34:08.160
I've predicted you for infinity.

34:08.160 --> 34:11.400
So it's really a degree to which you can,

34:12.560 --> 34:16.960
predict emergence I think relative to volatility.

34:16.960 --> 34:19.040
And I think we'll be able to,

34:19.040 --> 34:21.840
not necessarily that soon, but I think it's coming.

34:21.840 --> 34:23.400
We're gonna be able to predict emergence.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.960
So if we do, if we can predict emergence,

34:25.960 --> 34:29.360
and we can have models that can get to,

34:29.360 --> 34:31.380
let's say minimal description length,

34:31.380 --> 34:33.440
and they can improve their models

34:33.440 --> 34:36.400
such that they could always reach a higher level,

34:36.400 --> 34:39.600
a shorter description length,

34:39.600 --> 34:43.160
then I think we can predict infinity.

34:43.160 --> 34:44.360
I mean, there's a few things on that.

34:44.360 --> 34:49.360
So first of all, I think that when we have ecosystems

34:50.080 --> 34:53.560
of life, there is a degree of irreducible complexity.

34:53.560 --> 34:55.680
And I think there's a kind of power law distribution

34:55.680 --> 34:58.640
where some of it is reducible complexity

34:58.640 --> 35:01.080
and quite regular, and then a lot of it is so chaotic

35:01.080 --> 35:04.920
on the long tail that it's essentially irreducible.

35:04.920 --> 35:06.600
But I do think, what you said is very interesting

35:06.600 --> 35:08.940
about there being certain trade-offs about predictions.

35:08.940 --> 35:12.060
So yes, we could create low-resolution models

35:12.060 --> 35:13.980
that could predict far into the future.

35:13.980 --> 35:16.020
And we were having an interesting conversation

35:16.020 --> 35:18.700
about AlphaGo, because I think what that does

35:18.700 --> 35:20.780
is it's still a high precision.

35:20.780 --> 35:22.700
It's a high-resolution model,

35:24.100 --> 35:26.900
and even in respect of time steps.

35:26.900 --> 35:29.940
But what it does is it's not a robust model.

35:29.940 --> 35:31.060
So it's a point-alistic model.

35:31.060 --> 35:32.420
So what it's saying is like, okay,

35:32.420 --> 35:35.300
well, Go has a structure to it,

35:35.300 --> 35:38.700
because the state space is combinatorially large.

35:38.700 --> 35:39.660
It has a structure to it,

35:39.660 --> 35:41.580
and most of the humans traverse the structure

35:41.580 --> 35:45.340
along these joints, and I'm gonna just fill in the thing

35:45.340 --> 35:46.540
around the structure.

35:46.540 --> 35:48.060
And that's kind of what you're saying.

35:48.060 --> 35:51.220
So I've got this model, which represents trajectories

35:51.220 --> 35:54.620
on the structure, there's holes everywhere, right?

35:54.620 --> 35:56.160
No, I mean, I think that's exactly it.

35:56.160 --> 35:58.580
I think you're talking about the degree to which I can predict

35:58.580 --> 36:01.340
like say a black swan, right?

36:01.340 --> 36:02.900
What happens if there's a black swan?

36:02.900 --> 36:05.700
I can't predict that, like that's outside of the bounce.

36:05.700 --> 36:10.700
So there's always a limit to given

36:11.300 --> 36:14.660
a sort of relatively static model, what I can predict,

36:14.660 --> 36:16.660
no matter how good that model is.

36:16.660 --> 36:19.860
Well, we're talking about models that continuously improve.

36:19.860 --> 36:24.860
So if I continue grabbing complexity

36:25.100 --> 36:28.340
and I continue improving, and I think

36:30.820 --> 36:35.660
you'd continue rolling out, say, your predictions.

36:35.660 --> 36:40.620
I think you'd, it would become increasingly possible

36:40.620 --> 36:43.580
for you to predict farther and farther ahead,

36:43.580 --> 36:47.740
especially if you have this capacity to predict

36:47.740 --> 36:49.500
something that qualifies as a black swan,

36:49.500 --> 36:51.620
which is just a phase shift, right?

36:51.620 --> 36:53.460
It's a phase shift that you can't see at the scale

36:53.460 --> 36:57.260
at which you're generally operating your predictions.

36:57.260 --> 36:59.100
So...

36:59.100 --> 37:02.180
Are you defining black swan to mean a rare single event

37:02.180 --> 37:04.380
or like a transition to a new regime?

37:06.060 --> 37:08.180
I mean, I think it's the same.

37:08.180 --> 37:11.380
I think a rare single event, effectively,

37:11.380 --> 37:16.380
if you do not have the capacity to adapt to it afterwards,

37:17.460 --> 37:19.380
is effectively a new regime.

37:20.420 --> 37:25.420
So black swans can either trigger your resilience,

37:26.300 --> 37:31.100
but that effectively means you had the capacity

37:31.100 --> 37:35.100
to deal with policies that could take you across.

37:35.100 --> 37:37.180
So while you couldn't predict the event itself,

37:37.180 --> 37:39.860
you had policies that were capable of dealing with it.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.260
And if you can't deal with it,

37:42.260 --> 37:45.180
and you had no policies that could account

37:45.180 --> 37:48.420
for this degree of error, like this is too much.

37:48.420 --> 37:50.820
So I think that's effectively, at that point,

37:50.820 --> 37:52.060
you become in a new regime.

37:52.060 --> 37:52.900
Interesting.

37:52.900 --> 37:53.740
Okay, okay.

37:53.740 --> 37:57.100
Let's move over to general phenomenology

37:57.100 --> 37:58.140
and an activism type stuff.

37:58.140 --> 38:01.220
So the early anactivists,

38:01.220 --> 38:04.700
they thought that agents kind of construct

38:04.700 --> 38:06.300
their own environment

38:06.300 --> 38:09.820
and that they have a phenomenal experience.

38:09.820 --> 38:12.100
We were discussing earlier, like this,

38:12.100 --> 38:14.940
the extent to which the phenomenal component

38:14.940 --> 38:17.580
adds something to an agent.

38:17.580 --> 38:18.580
What's your take on that?

38:18.580 --> 38:19.500
Oh, no, I think it does.

38:19.500 --> 38:24.500
I think it forces the agent

38:25.060 --> 38:27.740
to deal with that information.

38:28.260 --> 38:33.260
Let's say, through a little more constraints,

38:35.100 --> 38:36.860
you can understand something,

38:38.340 --> 38:42.980
but it will have very low impact on your behavior

38:42.980 --> 38:44.540
if you don't feel it.

38:44.540 --> 38:47.460
You can have rules about things,

38:47.460 --> 38:51.620
but what if I take away the rules?

38:51.620 --> 38:54.940
Well, there's nothing then.

38:54.940 --> 38:59.940
Like we're just understanding doesn't entail anything.

38:59.980 --> 39:03.100
So effectively phenomenology

39:04.020 --> 39:07.660
sort of forces you into some constraints, right?

39:07.660 --> 39:10.260
It's phenomenology only arises

39:10.260 --> 39:14.540
in relation to your self-model.

39:14.540 --> 39:17.740
So what I'm gonna focus on

39:17.740 --> 39:21.380
relates to what I need to focus on,

39:21.380 --> 39:23.060
what will give me more information,

39:23.060 --> 39:25.300
what relates to my utility function,

39:25.300 --> 39:29.460
what I, the intensity of what I feel

39:29.460 --> 39:33.540
relates to how closely or how deeply

39:33.540 --> 39:35.220
it affects my internal states.

39:35.220 --> 39:37.340
Like there's a whole set of things like this

39:37.340 --> 39:39.700
that relate to internal external dynamics.

39:39.700 --> 39:42.660
So I do think it adds something.

39:42.660 --> 39:45.540
Effectively, it adds a degree of precision

39:45.540 --> 39:47.620
relative to the policies you're gonna have to take

39:47.620 --> 39:50.380
to maintain, to self-organize.

39:50.380 --> 39:55.380
Without these, you just have some sort of blank picture

39:57.180 --> 39:59.660
on which you're not really capable of focusing.

40:00.580 --> 40:03.460
We're really good at this reflexive self-attention

40:03.460 --> 40:06.340
and also knowing what to pay attention to around us

40:06.340 --> 40:08.420
and knowing what level of resolution,

40:08.420 --> 40:09.900
how much can we discard?

40:09.900 --> 40:11.500
So for example, we don't need to know

40:11.500 --> 40:13.620
what the title of all of these books are around us

40:13.620 --> 40:15.260
at the moment because it's not relevant.

40:15.260 --> 40:17.740
So we have this great ability to just discard

40:17.740 --> 40:19.040
all relevant information.

40:19.040 --> 40:22.120
But I don't think phenomenology adds anything

40:22.120 --> 40:25.000
to that discussion, which is to say like,

40:25.000 --> 40:27.800
what is it about phenomenology?

40:27.800 --> 40:30.040
What value does it add in of itself

40:30.040 --> 40:33.200
that can't be explained by just the basic agent framework?

40:34.720 --> 40:36.080
Well, the basic agent framework,

40:36.080 --> 40:40.640
does it have a reflexive model of itself?

40:40.640 --> 40:45.640
Like is it capable of determining how it functions

40:46.040 --> 40:47.560
and how that functioning relates

40:47.560 --> 40:49.800
to specific elements outside of itself?

40:49.800 --> 40:51.520
Well, that's a great question actually.

40:51.520 --> 40:56.080
So, because we were saying earlier that to be an agent,

40:56.080 --> 40:58.960
you need to have this like reflexive model of yourself.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.760
And in order for that to happen,

41:00.760 --> 41:02.760
you have to be around other agents

41:02.760 --> 41:04.240
because you have to pass information out

41:04.240 --> 41:05.480
and it comes in again.

41:05.480 --> 41:09.480
So, but this self-awareness I think you would argue

41:09.480 --> 41:11.720
only happens when you have a sufficient level

41:11.720 --> 41:13.760
of nesting or complexity.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.680
Sure, yeah, absolutely.

41:15.720 --> 41:17.840
But then how does it emerge there?

41:17.840 --> 41:19.840
So, you add the complexity,

41:19.840 --> 41:23.000
but what is it that makes this reflexive self-model emerge?

41:27.360 --> 41:32.360
So, we're trying to suppose right now,

41:33.760 --> 41:38.760
like we're trying to make a self-model emerge.

41:40.920 --> 41:44.080
Like most of the time when you create an agent

41:44.080 --> 41:46.880
that has a self-model, you just endow it with it.

41:46.880 --> 41:50.920
So, if you're asking me how does the self-model emerge?

41:50.920 --> 41:52.320
I think, I mean, I could explain it to you

41:52.320 --> 41:54.240
in terms of like evolutionary demands,

41:54.240 --> 41:58.240
the kinds of systems that we're able to represent

42:00.240 --> 42:02.880
through some kind of tracking mechanism,

42:02.880 --> 42:07.880
their own functioning on top of the functioning itself.

42:08.920 --> 42:13.320
And that through that tracking of their own functioning,

42:13.320 --> 42:15.280
they were able to modulate the precision

42:15.280 --> 42:16.400
on their functioning.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.080
I mean, that's an explanation of how it emerges, right?

42:18.080 --> 42:20.160
On a purely evolutionary stance.

42:21.560 --> 42:24.680
Now, how does that come about?

42:26.040 --> 42:27.560
I'm not sure I can tell you exactly,

42:27.560 --> 42:29.960
but we are suggesting that potentially

42:32.520 --> 42:34.600
a system can track anything, right?

42:34.600 --> 42:36.120
Can track the outside,

42:36.120 --> 42:38.640
can track the inside to some extent.

42:38.640 --> 42:42.560
So, now that it tracks something,

42:42.560 --> 42:44.640
it makes predictions and these predictions

42:44.640 --> 42:48.040
are either good or they carry error.

42:48.040 --> 42:50.320
Given that they carry error too often,

42:50.320 --> 42:53.680
it could choose, it has the possibility

42:53.680 --> 42:55.280
to create a new state.

42:55.280 --> 42:58.160
Like just change its model, create a new state space

42:58.160 --> 42:59.800
and that would be structure learning.

42:59.800 --> 43:03.720
And so, the supposition would be

43:03.720 --> 43:07.520
that let's say a system that has as an action,

43:07.520 --> 43:10.200
as a possible action to let's say,

43:10.200 --> 43:12.120
create a bunch of cells over here

43:12.160 --> 43:14.160
that can track that stuff,

43:14.160 --> 43:17.320
it will survive longer than the system

43:17.320 --> 43:20.040
that doesn't push a bunch of cells over here

43:20.040 --> 43:21.440
that happen to have the capacity

43:21.440 --> 43:24.200
to track what they're doing.

43:24.200 --> 43:28.480
So, we were gonna test this with say,

43:29.800 --> 43:31.920
an agent that does a simple, silly task,

43:31.920 --> 43:34.440
like find this thing over there.

43:34.440 --> 43:37.960
Or now find it, but in a graph that's like 1000 node long.

43:37.960 --> 43:39.960
Are you better at it if you have a self model

43:39.960 --> 43:41.760
or are you worse at it if you have self model?

43:41.800 --> 43:43.480
And we're not gonna give it the self model.

43:43.480 --> 43:46.600
We're gonna try and see if it can,

43:46.600 --> 43:48.800
through an action of modeling anything

43:48.800 --> 43:51.560
or changing anything, it can start modeling

43:51.560 --> 43:55.120
its own processes and see if that allows it

43:55.120 --> 43:57.080
to eventually, through structure learning,

43:57.080 --> 43:59.400
grow into something that has a self model.

43:59.400 --> 44:01.000
Yeah, I mean, I can believe,

44:01.000 --> 44:02.440
because it sounds very principal to me.

44:02.440 --> 44:04.640
So, I can believe that it would emerge

44:04.640 --> 44:08.400
and it would be useful for survival to emerge.

44:08.400 --> 44:09.560
It makes a lot of sense to me.

44:09.560 --> 44:11.200
And also, it reminds me of like,

44:11.200 --> 44:12.800
Daniel Dennett's intentional stance.

44:12.800 --> 44:17.560
So, like whether or not other actors have mental states,

44:17.560 --> 44:19.520
treating them as if they did,

44:19.520 --> 44:21.280
so that you can make better predictions

44:21.280 --> 44:22.520
about what they do.

44:22.520 --> 44:24.760
That's also very, very useful.

44:24.760 --> 44:28.000
But also, this kind of projection can be misleading

44:28.000 --> 44:29.560
because people look at language models

44:29.560 --> 44:31.760
and they say they have a theory of mind

44:31.760 --> 44:34.360
and they're regurgitating things

44:34.360 --> 44:35.960
from the psychology literature and they're saying,

44:35.960 --> 44:38.000
oh, look, let's do this theory of mind test

44:38.000 --> 44:39.160
on a language model.

44:39.200 --> 44:41.840
Oh, it seems to have a theory of mind.

44:41.840 --> 44:44.680
Well, I don't think it does have a theory of mind.

44:44.680 --> 44:48.240
So, like, is it just another form of anthropomorphization?

44:49.120 --> 44:49.960
So, that's the thing.

44:49.960 --> 44:52.120
So, when we say it, what do we mean?

44:53.080 --> 44:54.880
And I think it's possible

44:56.920 --> 44:59.400
that in the embedding,

45:00.440 --> 45:03.120
because it encodes something again,

45:03.120 --> 45:06.000
that could be sort of touring complete,

45:06.040 --> 45:11.040
there could be something which tracks theory of mind.

45:11.720 --> 45:13.960
But I don't think it,

45:13.960 --> 45:17.280
as in it's having awareness of,

45:17.280 --> 45:21.080
allowing it a causal model of theory of mind

45:21.080 --> 45:22.560
has theory of mind.

45:22.560 --> 45:24.080
That, to me, is different.

45:24.080 --> 45:26.760
So, can it regurgitate information

45:26.760 --> 45:29.640
that would act like theory of mind

45:29.640 --> 45:31.680
and be as accurate a theory of mind?

45:31.680 --> 45:32.520
Pretty sure it would.

45:32.520 --> 45:35.680
Yeah, it's possible with enough data thrown at it.

45:35.680 --> 45:36.520
Probably would.

45:38.240 --> 45:39.080
But,

45:40.480 --> 45:44.840
I don't think it would be able

45:44.840 --> 45:46.720
to tweak its own model

45:46.720 --> 45:48.280
such that it can

45:50.200 --> 45:55.200
really identify why and how

45:55.200 --> 45:57.880
or where it has theory of mind.

45:57.880 --> 46:01.480
Like, I don't think it could self-model in that way.

46:01.480 --> 46:06.160
And I don't think it could tweak its own model like that.

46:06.160 --> 46:07.000
Whereas,

46:08.800 --> 46:10.200
I'm pretty sure I can.

46:10.200 --> 46:14.040
I'm pretty sure I have the capacity to know

46:14.040 --> 46:15.080
that's what I'm doing.

46:15.080 --> 46:16.880
I'm putting that into you.

46:16.880 --> 46:18.880
And therefore,

46:18.880 --> 46:22.480
through trying to understand the causal chains

46:22.480 --> 46:26.560
that lead me to getting theory of mind about you,

46:26.560 --> 46:30.840
I can maybe change how that manifests

46:30.840 --> 46:34.280
or increment over it or add more precision

46:34.280 --> 46:36.760
or even transfer it to something else

46:36.760 --> 46:39.800
to which now I will give some degree of theory of mind

46:39.800 --> 46:44.640
because I've made that conscious tweak in my model.

46:44.640 --> 46:45.680
Yeah, yeah.

46:45.680 --> 46:48.400
Okay, we had an interesting discussion earlier

46:48.400 --> 46:50.040
about mediation.

46:50.040 --> 46:53.920
So, and it's related to semantics, right?

46:53.920 --> 46:55.520
So, we understand each other.

46:55.520 --> 46:57.120
And in this conversation,

46:58.080 --> 47:02.680
let's say we're creating this temporary construction.

47:02.680 --> 47:05.600
So, we're implementing the mediation pattern.

47:05.600 --> 47:08.360
And we've selected some categories

47:08.360 --> 47:10.040
that we kind of agree on the semantics

47:10.040 --> 47:11.320
and we're kind of like mediating

47:11.320 --> 47:13.360
through that shared structure.

47:13.360 --> 47:14.720
And that to me,

47:14.720 --> 47:18.000
I mean, I guess that's like a kind of bespoke theory of mind,

47:18.000 --> 47:20.200
which we've just created now.

47:21.440 --> 47:24.600
The fact that we're capable of mediating through language?

47:24.680 --> 47:26.160
Yeah, not that well, I mean,

47:26.160 --> 47:28.960
as we're using language in a very broad term,

47:28.960 --> 47:29.800
as we said earlier,

47:29.800 --> 47:31.800
so we're communicating using language,

47:31.800 --> 47:35.520
but we are using a certain vernacular,

47:35.520 --> 47:37.280
we're talking about certain categories and so on

47:37.280 --> 47:38.120
that that we agree with.

47:38.120 --> 47:40.560
But I guess like the reason I'm bringing up mediation

47:40.560 --> 47:44.680
is perhaps we are communicating

47:44.680 --> 47:48.440
in a slightly adapted way than we naturally would.

47:48.440 --> 47:51.800
Yeah, so to me, the reason that this allows me to derive

47:51.800 --> 47:53.280
that we have theory of mind

47:53.280 --> 47:55.520
is because through this,

47:55.520 --> 48:00.520
I can sort of push away a specialization to you

48:01.680 --> 48:04.640
that allows me no longer to compute

48:04.640 --> 48:05.680
what you're gonna compute

48:05.680 --> 48:08.440
and still together reach our goal.

48:09.840 --> 48:11.600
What this means?

48:11.600 --> 48:13.240
I think you can model me

48:14.240 --> 48:16.380
and I think I can model you.

48:18.040 --> 48:19.000
That's it.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.440
To me, that's the extent of it.

48:20.440 --> 48:22.240
Like I can put myself in your shoes

48:22.280 --> 48:23.280
and know what you're gonna do

48:23.280 --> 48:24.800
and you can put yourself in my shoes

48:24.800 --> 48:26.840
and know what I'm gonna do.

48:26.840 --> 48:29.080
And that's just shared pretensions.

48:29.080 --> 48:31.240
It's shared coordination

48:31.240 --> 48:33.880
because I've outsourced something to you

48:33.880 --> 48:36.920
that I think reliably you're going to push

48:36.920 --> 48:38.360
towards a similar outcome.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.360
I don't think it's that complicated.

48:41.360 --> 48:45.160
I think definitely language is one of our main mediums

48:45.160 --> 48:47.960
through which we understand how we reach that coordination,

48:47.960 --> 48:49.840
but there's so much more to it, right?

48:49.840 --> 48:54.840
Like institutions embedded material reality,

48:56.600 --> 49:00.040
physical constraints, phenotype, time.

49:00.040 --> 49:05.040
Like there's so much to these shared flows

49:06.680 --> 49:11.280
that we are part of that we both know how to interact with

49:11.280 --> 49:13.200
and I know you know how to interact with them

49:13.200 --> 49:14.400
and how can I recognize that?

49:14.400 --> 49:16.800
Well, I see you interacting with them.

49:16.800 --> 49:18.840
I know that were I in your position,

49:18.840 --> 49:21.880
I would do very much the same thing.

49:21.880 --> 49:24.920
And I can tell you can tell I'm doing the same thing

49:24.920 --> 49:26.320
because you put the chair there.

49:26.320 --> 49:30.040
I'm pretty sure you intended me to sit and talk in that thing.

49:30.040 --> 49:32.200
You didn't tell me that.

49:32.200 --> 49:34.040
We understood through the scripts

49:34.040 --> 49:37.880
that we were able to reliably predict that this happened.

49:37.880 --> 49:42.880
So that's to me the medium is quite broad,

49:43.360 --> 49:47.200
but it manifests through its reliability.

49:47.200 --> 49:48.840
Yes, yeah, interesting.

49:48.840 --> 49:51.280
And in some sense, our generative models,

49:51.280 --> 49:53.480
even though they are very, very different,

49:53.480 --> 49:56.000
there is a significant intersection,

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
although I don't think it makes sense to talk about

49:58.000 --> 50:00.040
an intersection of the high resolution generative model.

50:00.040 --> 50:03.280
It's more about the language or not only the language,

50:03.280 --> 50:05.040
you were talking about the performativity

50:05.040 --> 50:06.040
of sitting down in a chair

50:06.040 --> 50:09.240
and like the various things that we do,

50:09.240 --> 50:13.800
they can create intersections to bridge understanding.

50:13.800 --> 50:14.640
Absolutely.

50:14.640 --> 50:17.400
That's why poetry to me is mind-boggling.

50:17.400 --> 50:22.320
Like poetry to me is precisely those intersections

50:22.320 --> 50:24.960
which are generally inexistent.

50:24.960 --> 50:25.800
They're novel.

50:25.800 --> 50:28.320
Like we're literally creating images

50:28.320 --> 50:30.600
nobody else has created before, creating connections

50:30.600 --> 50:32.520
nobody else has created before.

50:32.520 --> 50:35.040
And yet, or at least it's the hope,

50:35.040 --> 50:37.280
people understand poetry.

50:37.280 --> 50:42.280
You have created an entirely new constraint system

50:42.400 --> 50:46.560
which normally doesn't point to anything.

50:46.560 --> 50:49.960
And somehow, because there's all these webs

50:49.960 --> 50:52.880
of other constraints that I can sort of pull from

50:52.880 --> 50:56.840
in reliable ways, you and I will create

50:56.840 --> 51:01.840
the new series of intersections across all these dimensions

51:02.680 --> 51:06.240
and we still are capable of communicating

51:06.240 --> 51:07.520
and coordinating across that.

51:07.520 --> 51:09.960
To me, that's mind-boggling.

51:10.040 --> 51:10.880
Yeah, yeah.

51:10.880 --> 51:13.080
And so subjectivity fascinates me

51:13.080 --> 51:16.480
and poetry we spoke about going to a music festival earlier.

51:16.480 --> 51:20.640
And at the music festival, the shared experience

51:20.640 --> 51:24.640
is that weird sense of being with other people.

51:24.640 --> 51:27.320
Clearly not, what does it mean to understand music?

51:27.320 --> 51:29.600
What does it mean to understand poetry?

51:29.600 --> 51:30.440
I'm not sure.

51:30.440 --> 51:33.640
Like it's this moment of, whoop,

51:33.640 --> 51:35.360
something new is happening here

51:35.360 --> 51:38.600
and we can both reliably feel there's something new.

51:38.640 --> 51:41.120
And now what we make of that something new,

51:41.120 --> 51:44.680
I think is why poetry is a terrible way to communicate.

51:44.680 --> 51:46.880
Like I mean, great, you've made something clever.

51:46.880 --> 51:49.160
We both felt something, something new here

51:49.160 --> 51:52.800
and we communicated the fact that we understand this gap

51:52.800 --> 51:55.720
and there's the possibility for our feeling of this gap

51:55.720 --> 52:00.720
to be similar and if it's, to me, a good poem

52:01.200 --> 52:04.320
will have reliably similar experiences

52:04.320 --> 52:07.280
in the sense that some poem means to say something to you,

52:07.280 --> 52:08.960
not just create an experience.

52:08.960 --> 52:12.680
Like I was just watching this video on YouTube

52:12.680 --> 52:14.200
the other day about Rupi Kaur

52:14.200 --> 52:17.920
and how she with her Insta poetry kind of ruined poetry

52:17.920 --> 52:20.120
because a lot of her poems are like,

52:20.120 --> 52:22.480
her poems are like completely like first level.

52:22.480 --> 52:24.000
They're just, they're just,

52:24.000 --> 52:26.040
she just said, this is a book and I have a book.

52:26.040 --> 52:28.040
Like there's nothing there, right?

52:29.800 --> 52:34.800
But sometimes through the clever ways that her words

52:35.800 --> 52:40.800
mix in a new and powerful, surprising way,

52:42.040 --> 52:45.840
you will feel this intensity and connect this intensity

52:45.840 --> 52:49.120
with a term you wouldn't have normally.

52:50.120 --> 52:54.760
And that's a new phenomenology that has given you a meaning.

52:54.760 --> 52:58.560
You now understand what it's like to be a woman.

52:58.560 --> 53:00.560
You would never have put that intensity

53:00.560 --> 53:02.960
on this connection of concepts

53:03.120 --> 53:05.080
that doesn't mean anything to you.

53:05.080 --> 53:07.160
It's like there's no valence there.

53:07.160 --> 53:10.760
And now there is and suddenly you've experienced something

53:10.760 --> 53:12.720
that she meant to make you experience.

53:12.720 --> 53:15.840
And so she has communicated what she meant to communicate.

53:15.840 --> 53:20.120
There's very low uncertainty there.

53:20.120 --> 53:23.160
But when you read a poem by some abstract poet

53:23.160 --> 53:28.160
who says something that, I mean, it's surprising

53:28.160 --> 53:30.840
but I don't understand what he's trying to say to me.

53:30.840 --> 53:32.800
I feel like it's not going as far.

53:32.800 --> 53:35.160
Like, yeah, okay, I felt the surprise

53:35.160 --> 53:39.600
but now it has no, it doesn't help with my model.

53:39.600 --> 53:42.000
It doesn't go any deeper.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.640
And perhaps that poetry is not for me.

53:43.640 --> 53:46.360
It doesn't give me a new phenomenology

53:46.360 --> 53:49.320
other than the surprise of the words.

53:49.320 --> 53:51.400
Yeah, that really resonates with me.

53:51.400 --> 53:54.880
And I think where I was getting stuck before is,

53:54.880 --> 53:57.160
I thought, well, and I think of meaning

53:57.160 --> 53:59.400
and understanding as being quite related.

53:59.480 --> 54:04.480
And you could have a very impactful phenomenal experience

54:04.800 --> 54:07.600
but I was worried it might stop with you, but it doesn't.

54:07.600 --> 54:12.360
So as long as the information can propagate, right?

54:12.360 --> 54:14.880
It has this memetic quality to it

54:14.880 --> 54:18.080
because there is no meaning without grounding

54:18.080 --> 54:19.760
but everything is grounded.

54:19.760 --> 54:23.120
So you're reading a poem, you're sitting in this location.

54:23.120 --> 54:25.880
It's now been grounded to this location.

54:25.880 --> 54:29.640
You now create a yearly pilgrimage

54:29.640 --> 54:31.920
where you come back to this location with your friends

54:31.920 --> 54:33.520
and you read the same poem

54:33.520 --> 54:37.120
and then this memetic energy builds

54:37.120 --> 54:38.800
and builds and builds.

54:38.800 --> 54:41.400
So, and maybe it doesn't always work that way

54:41.400 --> 54:46.040
but I think you can interpret that as still forming meaning.

54:46.040 --> 54:49.840
No, I agree, but I think I would find interesting

54:49.840 --> 54:51.200
the thought experiment of,

54:51.200 --> 54:53.040
because you and I, we exist in this world, right?

54:53.040 --> 54:55.080
So obviously our meaning is in this world.

54:55.120 --> 54:57.480
So we can create emergent structures

54:57.480 --> 55:00.160
but in the end they always bottom out to this world.

55:00.160 --> 55:04.040
But what if we were, to your point earlier,

55:04.040 --> 55:08.960
entirely systems that only exist in words?

55:08.960 --> 55:12.920
Like we, it's just words that like through some kind

55:12.920 --> 55:14.840
of functor becomes other words

55:14.840 --> 55:16.520
and then connect to other words.

55:16.520 --> 55:20.080
And it's just like large graph of words to words to words.

55:20.080 --> 55:25.080
And anytime a path through words is enacted,

55:26.520 --> 55:28.960
it triggers other paths through words.

55:30.520 --> 55:34.280
I feel like you could have something that resembles

55:36.160 --> 55:37.880
phenomenology.

55:37.880 --> 55:41.040
It just wouldn't be this.

55:41.040 --> 55:43.600
Like there's a possibility for a system

55:43.600 --> 55:48.600
to fully be contained and self-organized

55:49.200 --> 55:54.200
within that so long as its maintenance

55:56.400 --> 56:00.520
is conditioned upon it having a boundary

56:00.520 --> 56:02.680
which it has to maintain.

56:02.680 --> 56:04.280
Otherwise it disappears.

56:04.280 --> 56:07.360
So I could totally see some kind of simulation

56:07.360 --> 56:10.800
of like graphs that try to stay graphs

56:10.800 --> 56:13.720
and become so complex that they maintain graphs

56:13.720 --> 56:17.400
and it wouldn't really relate to their capacity

56:17.400 --> 56:18.520
to exchange bits, right?

56:18.880 --> 56:20.040
Again, it would have nothing to do

56:20.040 --> 56:22.560
with the physical embodiment of it.

56:22.560 --> 56:24.600
It's just that I can't conceive of anything

56:24.600 --> 56:28.240
that wouldn't have a physical embodiment to some degree.

56:28.240 --> 56:30.240
So, but I don't think that's impossible.

56:32.120 --> 56:35.440
Before we finish, I'm supposed to ask you about resiliency.

56:35.440 --> 56:38.520
Collective intelligences, they are grown.

56:38.520 --> 56:41.080
They're not designed by definition.

56:41.080 --> 56:43.200
And they have some interesting properties.

56:43.200 --> 56:45.800
They can kind of heal themselves, repair themselves.

56:45.800 --> 56:47.200
But there's a lot of complexity.

56:47.200 --> 56:49.880
We don't understand what they're doing entirely.

56:49.880 --> 56:52.800
But I guess like it is intuitive to me

56:52.800 --> 56:55.440
how, I mean, Michael Levin talks about this,

56:55.440 --> 56:58.320
you know, a collective intelligence is more resilient

56:58.320 --> 56:59.520
because of self-organization.

56:59.520 --> 57:01.600
But can you kind of explain from your perspective

57:01.600 --> 57:02.680
like why you think that is?

57:02.680 --> 57:04.320
Yeah, I mean, exactly why?

57:04.320 --> 57:08.160
Why is self-organization of a group more resilient?

57:09.200 --> 57:10.720
So we talked about it earlier,

57:10.720 --> 57:14.000
like how do we define resilience?

57:14.000 --> 57:16.800
We define resilience as the capacity for a system

57:16.800 --> 57:21.280
given a perturbation to either remain the same

57:22.800 --> 57:27.800
or live the perturbation and return to what it was before

57:29.080 --> 57:34.080
or learn something new and adapt and become better, right?

57:35.480 --> 57:38.120
So generally we think of black swans

57:38.120 --> 57:40.200
as these highly improbable things

57:40.200 --> 57:43.880
that you kind of, you can't really deal with.

57:43.920 --> 57:47.040
And so generally what'll happen with a black swan

57:47.040 --> 57:50.520
is it'll vastly perturb your system.

57:50.520 --> 57:53.160
And if you have the seed of the system

57:53.160 --> 57:55.840
and might grow again and return to what it was,

57:55.840 --> 58:00.840
so from that point already, it doesn't have inertia.

58:01.400 --> 58:04.280
Inertia is like the wind on the cup.

58:04.280 --> 58:06.240
The cup, the wind is a disruption,

58:06.240 --> 58:09.440
but it's so, it has such inertia in its policies

58:09.440 --> 58:11.320
that it's like it's gonna stay a cup.

58:11.320 --> 58:13.800
Now, a black swan is me grabbing the cup

58:13.800 --> 58:14.920
and dropping it on the floor.

58:14.920 --> 58:16.520
It can't deal with that.

58:16.520 --> 58:20.200
Now, a plastic cup or like say a rubber cup,

58:20.200 --> 58:22.240
it'll get on the floor, it'll bounce a little,

58:22.240 --> 58:24.880
it'll deform and it'll come back.

58:24.880 --> 58:26.760
A smart plastic cup.

58:28.440 --> 58:33.000
Now that cup will not only, you know, it'll fall,

58:33.000 --> 58:35.440
it'll learn what happened in the fall

58:35.440 --> 58:39.160
and it'll be like, what was the cause of the fall?

58:39.160 --> 58:40.120
Somebody grab me.

58:40.120 --> 58:42.000
So next time something comes to grab me,

58:42.000 --> 58:43.000
I'll move a little bit.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.720
So that would be a plastic system.

58:44.720 --> 58:49.560
So the reason systems that are groups

58:49.560 --> 58:51.080
have the capacity for resilience

58:51.080 --> 58:55.760
is because they have the capacity for one,

58:55.760 --> 58:58.760
creating some core of inertia.

58:58.760 --> 59:01.600
Something of the group will be maintained.

59:01.600 --> 59:04.680
Like they have a very strong inside,

59:04.680 --> 59:06.840
it's very clear about what it is

59:06.840 --> 59:09.320
and it'll be able to continue pushing

59:09.320 --> 59:10.800
what it is into the world.

59:10.800 --> 59:13.120
Then it has like structures that are a bit more,

59:13.120 --> 59:15.280
you know, like elastic.

59:15.280 --> 59:18.840
They'll take disturbances, but they'll come back

59:18.840 --> 59:20.160
and they'll be able to do that

59:20.160 --> 59:22.920
because they can receive again the signal from the inside

59:22.920 --> 59:24.400
that's like, this is what we are.

59:24.400 --> 59:26.280
Okay, all right, let's go back.

59:26.280 --> 59:28.440
And through this, they understand

59:28.440 --> 59:30.480
that they have predictability,

59:30.480 --> 59:32.280
potentially even redundancy.

59:32.280 --> 59:33.880
So now what happens with redundancy?

59:33.880 --> 59:36.480
Well, maybe it becomes the generacy.

59:36.480 --> 59:38.760
So while this is doing that

59:38.760 --> 59:41.080
and I have a certainty that it's gonna keep doing that

59:41.080 --> 59:43.000
because this is super certain

59:43.000 --> 59:44.960
and this is likely to return,

59:44.960 --> 59:49.720
now I can maybe venture off and try something different

59:49.720 --> 59:52.880
because even if I die, even if part of me dies,

59:52.880 --> 59:55.720
this is pretty certain to continue.

59:55.720 --> 59:58.560
So now I have the capacity to not only

59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.800
should this die continue having the same function

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.920
but should this die return to that function, right?

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:07.880
We both have the capacity to maintain that function

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.880
where we have high certainty over this path

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.080
which we know is a good path,

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.280
but we also have the capacity to learn more

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.560
and become more fit relative to a landscape

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.760
and expand such that one day

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.920
when relative to this system, the black swan arrives,

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:28.560
we are so big now, we have so many paths.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.560
The black swan is no longer gonna be a black swan,

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.480
the likelihood of a black swan decreases

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.640
as you increase your fitness landscape.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.120
And have you studied,

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.560
redundancy is quite an interesting one

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:44.120
because presumably the system would learn

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.440
its own level of redundancy

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.680
and that must surely be related to things

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.160
like its behavioral complexity

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.640
and like its sense world environment and so on.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.760
So Alex Kieffer, so we wrote a paper on this specifically

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:01.400
and Alex Kieffer wrote a beautiful formalism

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.960
that basically qualified redundancy

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.160
as a degree of useless complexity.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.400
Anything that is not useless complexity is degeneracy.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.560
So I have two hands, but if I use one hand,

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:17.760
the other isn't useless, right?

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.680
It can do other things.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.480
We can play the piano, et cetera.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.920
Like it has the capacity to have different functions

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.880
even if it can do the same function.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:29.520
But if I had five hands and they could only do two things,

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.840
I'd have like three hands too many.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.120
Like it wouldn't be able,

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.480
unless I could create some emergent patterns

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:39.080
through the repetition of certain,

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:42.520
at some point I would expend a lot of energy

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:46.240
in maintaining things which are most often useless.

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.320
Interesting, but so I agree that

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:52.040
we have to be really economical with function

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.560
because function is our interface.

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.800
But I was talking earlier about,

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.560
in this active inference framework,

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.320
we could potentially swap out agents

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.320
with different skill programs.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.240
So we could have like a marketplace of intelligence.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.080
But then it's kind of degenerate

01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.240
to have lots of agents kicking about that we're not using

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.440
because we're holding onto them on the basis

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.160
that they might be useful in the future.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.720
So we come into a new regime.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.040
Oh, let's bring this guy back in

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.120
because it's started making good predictions again.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.840
But I don't wanna be holding these guys around for too long.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.600
So I think you mean redundant.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:27.560
They would be redundant

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.400
because they wouldn't be doing any other function.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.000
If they were degenerate,

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.240
they would be trying to expand the fitness landscape

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.080
and therefore they would never be useless.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.120
Well, I would say that they are harming

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.320
the intelligence of the overall collective

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.080
because they are essentially,

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:47.040
they're creating predictions which are not useful.

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.680
They're polluting the predictive apparatus.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.600
But no, I think it's an interesting point.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.960
But so come back to what you were saying before.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.600
So you said if they are hanging around,

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.440
they are degeneracy.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.960
So what's the difference between redundancy and degeneracy?

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:05.800
So that's the thing.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.920
I think if they're just hanging around

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:12.000
and not doing anything, then they're just redundant.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.080
But if they're doing stuff

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:15.760
which is rowing in the wrong direction,

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.720
then it's degeneracy.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.200
Yeah, I mean, degeneracy doesn't entail

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.520
that you're gonna necessarily go in the right direction,

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:24.360
but it gives you the possibility to,

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.160
which means you can increase your fitness landscape.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.680
So increasing your fitness landscape

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.240
also means accruing error.

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.440
Like you're going to make some errors

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.560
and some parts of you are gonna die.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:39.600
So it's sometimes okay to continue accruing error.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.320
This is why I think that the distinction

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.880
between degeneracy and redundancy is important.

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:47.480
If you're just expanding energy for something

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.160
which literally doesn't help you right now

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.320
but is doing the same thing as something else

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.840
which would potentially help you,

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:58.920
and it's not, like there's so much redundancy

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:02.600
that let's say given some error,

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.960
you still wouldn't need it,

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.960
then it's probably best to pull it away.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.760
But if it's doing something else in the meantime,

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.400
even if it's rowing in the wrong direction,

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.600
it's still doing something.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:20.040
It's still trying to compute some error

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.800
and it's possible that over time,

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:25.080
you will find that this is just not a thing you ever need.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.280
You will have accrued so much error

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:28.680
that you'll just push it away.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.360
And this is how your system changes over time as well.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:35.760
You don't just necessarily like grow as a blob, right?

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.440
You sometimes you just prune and you push it away.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:40.680
And it is good for you to learn

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.520
that you had to get rid of it.

01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.400
You wouldn't necessarily know otherwise.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.680
Yeah, yeah, it's stimulating some thoughts actually

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:49.280
because I guess it's very similar

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.200
to Friston's idea of entropy.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.960
So, you know, like maintaining behavioral complexity

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:55.640
because it might be useful.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:58.880
But there's this thing with gradient optimization.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.440
When you do monotonic gradient optimization,

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:05.280
you kind of expect to just strip away anything

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.000
that's not helping me.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.680
And sometimes you need to like maintain the degeneracy

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.000
for a significant amount of time

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.720
before it becomes useful later.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:15.000
So like in Friston's framework,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.320
I think it's like it's keeping it around,

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.600
but for quite a long time.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:24.480
Yeah, so I think it's all about the amount of energy

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.960
you have as say capital.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.800
And I think it touches into something really interesting

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.920
about psychology, like hoarders.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.080
Why do hoarders exist?

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.080
Like if you ask them, what's the likelihood

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:46.480
of you ever using that thing, like ever at all?

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.160
And they're like, well, maybe I'll need it.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.440
And then you point out to them a situation,

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.840
well, the situation happened where you would have needed it

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.320
and you still didn't use it.

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:55.280
Now, what do you think?

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:58.120
And it just, it doesn't update.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:02.520
So to them, it's like they don't have the right capacity

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.560
to update their model such that over time,

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:08.840
even given that probability and the fact that it happened,

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.360
et cetera, they can't prune it.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:13.000
But if it doesn't cost you anything,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.880
like you just have a, you have an adapter at home

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.000
and you never go to the US,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.200
but you still have it and it's like, whatever,

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.200
you know, it doesn't cause that much error.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:28.080
Maybe it's worth maintaining the possibility of a policy

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:30.120
which would use it.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.600
It's more about

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:37.360
given the pool of policies you're maintaining,

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.760
how much does it cost you to maintain a policy

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.320
that goes all the way over there,

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.400
even though you can tell your viability is over here.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.720
You could choose to do so and maybe it'll be adaptive,

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.520
but if it isn't, effectively the kind of system

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:53.800
that maintains the wrong balance

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:56.800
over the type of redundancy and degeneracy

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.800
that it maintains is just gonna,

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:00.960
yeah, it's gonna perish faster than the others.

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:04.400
Well, this has been amazing.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.840
Thank you so much for chatting with me.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.200
You're welcome, it was fun.
