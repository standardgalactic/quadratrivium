0	4240	Hey, everyone. Welcome to another episode of Deep Talks, Exploring Theology and Meaning Making.
4800	10080	Today, I'm joined by Brendan Graham Dempsey, who I have to confess, for those of you that have gone
10080	16080	through my lecture series on Meta-modernism, I'm indebted to. I referenced Brendan's work quite
16080	22080	a bit. He's got a great series of YouTube videos out there, but not just YouTube videos. He's also
22080	29520	a writer and author, and he has written a seven-volume series called Meta-modern Spirituality
29520	34800	series, and most recently Meta-modernism, or the cultural logic of cultural logics.
35600	40000	Brendan, I really do consider to be, maybe he wouldn't think of himself this way,
40000	45520	but I will heap some praise on him. I consider Brendan to be one of the leading voices addressing
45520	50720	what's happening in our cultural moment right now with the Meta-modern shift. Many of you have
50720	55600	been really fascinated by this topic and subject matter, so I thought I want to bring on an expert.
55600	59600	I don't claim to be an expert, but I'm going to bring on an expert here to discuss
60240	65840	what's happening. Many of you are feeling like as you're engaging with storytelling and the arts,
65840	69760	and you're seeing these spiritual shifts happening, these religious shifts happening,
69760	75360	you're going, what is going on? Brendan is here today to help maybe try to put a name to some of
75360	81760	that, help us understand where we've come from, where he maybe predicts this is all headed.
82080	85600	Brendan, thanks for being here today. Thank you so much for having me. This is great.
85600	90000	I'm excited. I've been watching your videos, really enjoyed the conversations you're having with
90000	95840	people like John Breveke and Paul Vander Clay. Yeah, just think you're putting out some excellent
95840	104080	content. Yeah, I'm excited to see what we dig into. Yeah. Okay, so for me, Brendan, I don't think I
104160	113040	had a name for this right away, and it took me a while to give a name to what I felt I was picking
113040	120560	up on in particular in pop culture, noticing like aesthetic shifts, shifts in storytelling.
120560	127280	I have, I think, first found myself intrigued by what seems like a shift from Charles Taylor's
127280	132560	secular age into what I consider to be like a kind of a new epoch, where like on the bleeding
132560	139600	edge of it, what I've called the post secular age, we're also emerging out of the, what I think is
139600	145840	probably the death of the new atheist movement into this new era in the West. And then I started
145840	153360	noticing this shift in storytelling, aesthetics, the arts. And I found philosophers and people
153360	162080	like yourself describing this after postmodernism shift as metamodernism. When and where did you
162080	168480	first become aware that something was shifting in the philosophical landscape, the worldview
168480	174240	landscape, the religious, the cultural stories that we're telling? When did you first become aware of
174240	179760	it? And maybe what were some of the things that first tipped you off to, oh, something different
179760	186240	than postmodernism is happening here? Yeah. So for me personally, I would say I discovered
186240	191040	metamodernism, which is this term that people are talking about to give a name to some of these shifts.
192240	199760	I discovered that back in 2013. And to be honest, for me, it was in the context of really seeing
199760	208320	still a lot of very much kind of the postmodern zeitgeist all around me in the arts. I was raised
208320	214560	on very postmodern films and television and whatnot, as well as, you know, there's kind of an
214560	220320	interesting dance between that stuff coming in, but also I was raised in a very Christian family
220400	224800	growing up rather conservative Christian family. So those things kind of mixed in an interesting way.
226000	234160	But it was out of my sort of dissatisfaction and kind of a disaffectedness with a lot of
234720	239360	the contemporary zeitgeist that I went looking in the first place to see what people were talking
239360	245120	about that might be out there that was beginning to emerge. I mean, I was, you know, from a young age,
245120	250720	actually really interested in the films of, say, Wes Anderson and some other interesting
250720	256160	stuff that was starting to emerge that had a slightly different kind of vibe to it. But I
256160	262800	certainly didn't have any kind of a name or rubric to use. So it was around 2013 when I was
262800	268480	traveling, I was living in Europe at the time, and was trying to just make sense around the
268480	274240	aesthetic shifts that we would really now call postmodernism, like the shift that had become
274960	281280	just permeated society in terms of the aesthetic register that was operating with that so-called
281280	287920	cultural logic. And seeing, you know, is this where this ends? Is this where this all culminates?
287920	294800	Or is there something past the postmodern? And that's how I discovered the work of these Dutch
294800	300480	cultural theorists who are talking about metamodernism. And what's been partly fascinating about
300480	308160	tracking this is that it's been over the past, gosh, what, 10 years, right? That seeing what was
308160	313760	sort of initially kind of hinted at or beginning to be described at that point has really kind of
313760	319200	flowered and come to fruition in a big way in the last decade. So yeah, for me, it wasn't so much
319200	323280	looking around seeing big changes and then being like, what's this called? It's more like
323280	328880	getting intimations of some shifts and changes and myself being kind of an evidence of sort of like a
329840	334800	an exhaustedness with postmodernism and a looking beyond it and then finding this thing and then
334800	339760	seeing it really kind of, you know, increasingly accurately described the kinds of shifts
341200	343920	since then. So yeah, that was my experience with the term.
344880	350480	You mentioned already here, a couple of times, I think you just used the word exhaustion about
350480	359440	the way that the postmodern frame was impacting you. And I think as, you know, I'm 40,
360080	366800	much of my formative teenage years, like you growing up in a very conservative, evangelical
366800	372960	context, I was still engaging with the broader, I mean, we had our evangelical subculture with
372960	377200	all its DC talk and tooth and nail record bands and things like that. And I'm sure you probably
377200	382560	got into as well. Oh, yeah. But within that subculture, of course, we're plugged into a larger
382560	388800	culture, the culture, the the the the the meta culture over the over top of that. And of course,
388800	394960	much of what was going on in my formative heyday, where movies like Fight Club, even, you know,
394960	403440	in many ways, like Seinfeld was a shift away from modernist forms of comedy into something that was
404080	411120	self aware was, you know, I think Larry David famously had a line on the set that,
412320	416320	you know, we're going to make sure that there's no hugging, and nobody learns anything in each
416320	423760	episode, right? Which, which was such a like a critique, maybe a comedic sort of nihilism,
423760	430320	but a critique of the sitcom genre. So I very much can identify with that. But when you talk
430320	437600	about it, leaving you feeling exhausted, can you put your finger maybe on what was producing
437600	443840	that sense of exhaustion or dissatisfaction with that worldview, the worldview that was
443840	448400	supposed to be the critique really of all worldviews? Yeah, I mean, at the aesthetic level,
448400	453600	there's just a sense of, you know, it becomes a tired trick after a while, right? It's just
453600	457920	you've seen it so many times. And once you start to have some language for it, you're like, Oh,
457920	463360	yeah, there that is again. So that's largely what I mean by exhaustion, just the sense of like,
463920	470720	you know, Oh, this again. And by this, I mean things like, you know, you walk into an art gallery,
470720	476240	and there's like, I don't know, glitter and paint smeared on the ground. And then there's like a
476240	480560	little artist statement that's like, you know, untitled number 18, you know, and the little
480560	485600	artist statement says something like, this piece seeks to problematize our relationship with that
485680	490160	that that that. And, you know, when that stuff first starts to show up, you might be like, Oh,
490160	496080	this is kind of interesting, right? But like the opposite of interesting is boring. And so what I
496080	500640	think happened with a lot of postmodern art was it just reached this point of saturation in the
500640	507200	culture that it wasn't interesting anymore, which is sort of its claim to fame. And instead, I was
507200	512720	just increasingly boring. And so that's that's mostly what I mean by exhaustion. So there's
512720	518800	there's that though there is a worldview component to that as well. In the sense of to the degree
518800	523840	to which those sorts of aesthetic strategies are connected to the sort of broader, you know,
524560	531600	worldview of sort of the nihilism, cynicism, skepticism, right? There is a there is a point
531600	536960	in which that is itself kind of a tiredness. You know, a lot of the things that characterize the
536960	542880	postmodern period are its sense of an end. I think Jameson described that as right, everyone was
542880	547680	talking about the end of art and the end of this and the end of the end of the death of the author
547680	552560	and the end of history and everything was ending. And so everyone was sort of exhausted about
552560	557440	everything. It was sort of a cultural logic of exhaustion. And a lot of the kind of aesthetic
557440	563040	strategies I think reflected that. So you get exhausted by exhaustion. And that's a kind of
563120	568800	meta move, I suppose, that sort of starts to gesture towards, you know, what's beyond that,
568800	573600	what's what happens when you start becoming skeptical of skepticism in a bit cynical towards
573600	578160	the cynics, right? It's sort of inevitable that you're probably going to lead towards something a
578160	586480	bit more affirmational, positive, exuberant, idealistic, etc. So yeah. How do you understand,
586480	591440	and I've talked about this in my series, but I think it'd be helpful to hear another vantage
591440	600640	point on this. How do you understand the shift from modernism into an appetite for that sort of
600640	608560	aesthetic art and storytelling? What do you think the primary factors were that led from that modern
608560	615200	shift to the postmodern shift to make it probably something at some point, which had some some value?
615200	621600	I know, I want to be clear, because there's a lot of conversation, particularly in the sorts of
621600	628480	internet spaces that might be adjacent to your work and our work, where there's a lot of kind
628480	635200	of postmodern boogeyman stuff out there, right, which is like this was the worst thing to have
635200	641520	ever come about. And it was all because of this weird cultural Marxism, whatever, whatever that
641520	649680	means. Was there any validity to the initial shift from modernism? What were the postmodern
649680	655760	storytellers, artists, and thinkers? What were they trying to grasp at? And do you see there
655760	661200	being any continuing value for any of what postmodernism was grasping at that you see?
661200	666720	This needs to continue. And in the metamodern shift, it seems to be continuing to be held
666720	672240	on to as something valuable. I think it's a great question. It's an essential question. And I feel
672240	678400	like you won't really get metamodernism if you don't get that that's an important thing to be
678400	685040	asking. So I think you're exactly right. There's a lot of easy boogeymanning and strawmanning of
685040	690080	postmodernism. And to be fair, these are big terms that are supposed to encapsulate a whole
690080	694000	bunch of different things, right? So a lot of the time, I think we're often just talking past each
694080	699200	other. And so we should be aware up front that like, these are big categories, they're fuzzy,
699200	706000	people will be using these terms slightly differently. But I think that, yeah, if as I'm
706000	712320	sure we'll get into in a minute, if metamodernism, which is what comes after postmodernism, is doing
712320	718400	so by means still of postmodernism, then we have to take seriously the notion that something from
718480	725200	this reaction carries forward. And as for what that is, there's so many angles you can take on
725200	730560	this. And I think they're all relevant, they're all valid. And I don't want to get too much into
730560	735120	the weeds or too much over people's heads and try to deal with too much here. But I'll just name a
735120	745920	few components of it, right? There's at least, let's say, a historical cultural moment, which I
745920	751600	think really pushes us in this direction. And it largely comes after the World War II.
752960	758080	So let's step back a little bit, right? You know, the modern, of course, is in itself
758080	762800	kind of responding to the traditional worldview and a religious worldview. And a lot of what had come
763440	769280	as sort of the emergence of modernity and modernism, it was about sort of trying to
770160	777200	you could call this sort of the modern project, right? Like create something after the dissolution
778000	782560	and the rejection of maybe more traditional religious narratives, right? So you get new kinds
782560	788240	of grand narratives about reality, that it's about progress, that there's this evolutionary
788240	793680	direction that's sort of leaning cultures towards new heights. You see this and then this glorification
793680	798720	of technology gets wrapped up with this. So the modern is about the new and the novel and the
798720	805120	technological utopia that we're sort of all gloriously heading towards and, you know, and sort
805120	810960	of providing a new grand narrative of history that is not the sort of kind of classic Christian
810960	816480	narrative that had been, you know, the one to prevail throughout the entire, you know, medieval
816480	821840	period, essentially. Now it's a different narrative and it's rooted in this world and all those things
821840	827760	I just said. And I think that once you see what happens with World War II and how it just sort
827840	832160	of just cuts the legs out from under that, I think that's really important for understanding
832160	838720	the rise of postmodernism. Because a number of things happen there. Basically, this, this utopian
838720	846480	aspirational dream vision of history, you know, doesn't lead to utopia, it leads to the gulag
846480	853360	and to, you know, to Auschwitz, essentially. And so, you know, and technology starts being very
853920	858800	much clearly seen for the ways that it destroys, as well as creates the way that it alienates,
858800	864400	as well as, you know, brings people together. And so, yeah, really just the whole period from
864400	870880	World War I to World War II, which is really sort of a big colossal one war with sort of,
870880	876800	you know, interim period. Half time. Yeah, basically. And it's just this utter destruction
876800	883040	of the old world. And I think that that creates a sense of disenchantment with the entire
883040	891280	modern project and forces people to reevaluate, you know, the ideals of liberalism and enlightenment
891280	896960	values and supposedly this emancipatory project that modernity was, it seemed to lead to this
896960	902480	iron cage. So you get after World War II, people who are critical of these sorts of things,
903120	909360	critical of the ideals and all that. And yeah, that leads to an attitude of skepticism. It leads
909360	914800	to an attitude of cynicism, right? It's sort of like, oh, whose big narrative are you pushing at
914800	919280	me today, right? You know, it's like, we've been here before. There's this, yeah, there's this
919280	924160	profound distrust or, you know, hermeneutics of suspicion, right? So it makes sense that people
924160	930480	like Freud and Nietzsche and Marx come in to try to, you know, but even, of course, and this is
930480	935600	where part of this issue around like the cultural Marxism bit becomes really problematic is that
935600	941200	like, even Marx had a grand narrative, right? So what's so interesting about this postmodern
941200	946800	moment is like, no, even the Marxists are out the window because they're pushing some story.
946800	953280	And so, you know, once you've eschewed, great progress to exactly. Yeah, it's just, you know,
953280	958720	right, it's taking that Hegelian dialectic and moving it into a materialist frame.
958720	963920	Yeah. And certainly, a lot of those ideas had a direct link to what you see happen in World
963920	968880	War II. And then, of course, the aftermath of the Cold War. So you get, I think, a profound
968880	974240	disenchantment, disillusionment with this whole way of looking at the world. And there's a kind
974240	977280	of self-protective element that goes with that as well. It's sort of like, all right, I won't
977280	981840	believe anything, you know? And so nihilism, of course, is sort of a natural product of that.
981840	986480	So anyway, there's a, there's kind of cultural historical moment that sort of makes sense for
986480	993200	why those ideas would start to be on the rise. There's also, you know, technological things
993280	999600	that happen. There's, you could say, sort of evolutionary complexification, developmental
999600	1003520	angles that can be brought to this narrative. I could go on and on. So there's really a whole
1003520	1007920	set of things that kind of explain why all of a sudden you start seeing this emergence of these
1007920	1014640	ideas. But maybe more importantly, though, to get to the heart of your question, which is like,
1014640	1021360	what sort of carries forward from that, that is a value? And I will say this, that like,
1021440	1027600	a big thing that these critiques did was they forced us to be more sort of,
1028640	1034640	you know, demanding of what we took as true, right? It's sort of like, you know, there's this,
1034640	1040320	there's this critique of authority and this, these appeals to, you know, oh, well, this is the story,
1040320	1045440	this is the narrative, or this is the, you know, the political, you know, message or what have you.
1045440	1049040	There is sort of this sort of standing back and being like, well, no, we're not going to just,
1049040	1053200	you know, buy whatever bill of goods you're selling, we're going to really interrogate them,
1053920	1059280	ideally, right? And so one of the positive things that does come from that is a critique of certain
1059280	1063840	modern presumptions that had been taken for granted, which are now start to be sort of
1063840	1071040	exploded, right? Because once you start asking, well, for who is this story, you know, serving or
1071040	1078560	what, you know, to whose benefit does this particular message work, then you're starting to
1078560	1084960	become more aware of, you know, the exclusionary dynamics that go into selling stories and
1084960	1089040	grand narratives and sort of like who's being left out, who's being oppressed, who's being
1089600	1095840	used and exploited. So these issues become very salient to postmodern critiques of,
1096800	1102640	of things. And basically, in the absence of this is the true story of history,
1103280	1109120	all you've kind of got then is critiques of power and privilege to be able to fill in that gap.
1109760	1114720	And so some of that, some of that is legitimately very valuable. I mean, we need to be doing asking
1114720	1120320	those kinds of questions. And I think that the things like the civil rights movement movements
1120320	1127680	that come in the 60s, you know, are a big product of, you know, those cultural forces
1127680	1135040	shifting really much of the kind of cultural and sexual liberation and revolution kind of
1135040	1141120	is a product of some of these, you know, presumed axioms of sort of modern thought being sort of
1141120	1146880	exploded and having new opportunities to be critiqued and whatnot. So anyway, I could say a
1146880	1150240	lot more about that. But I guess I would just say that I think we should be asking more about
1151280	1156960	systems, right? What are the contexts that we're operating in? Let's see the things that we
1157920	1162960	were using to make sense of reality and examine those, right? So there's this moving back and
1162960	1168400	stepping back from the ideologies or the frameworks that you're using to make sense of reality and
1168400	1174720	interrogating those. And all of that I find to be very useful. And so when you start getting into
1174800	1179360	metamodernism, there's certain aspects in which we can't just throw that stuff out, we shouldn't.
1179360	1184880	There's profound insights to be gained from appreciating that we are in social contexts,
1184880	1189680	that humans do a lot to construct those contexts, and that we shouldn't just take a sort of natural
1189680	1195440	givens, things that we are enculturated into, and we should interrogate them. And that really
1195440	1201680	starts to set you up into a new place where you're able to see cultural objects as, you know,
1201680	1206320	objects of analysis and not just things that you see the world through. And then that can really,
1206320	1212400	you know, start to put you in a position where you're, where you have a cultural logic of cultural
1212400	1218000	logics, which is kind of what the book is about. The core of cores, right? I don't know if you
1219040	1225760	saw this or have seen this trend on YouTube and TikTok called core core. No, I haven't.
1226560	1231680	Okay, so this is really fascinating. And I think this has connection to the aesthetic
1232240	1237040	interests of metamodernism. So side tangent here, and I want to come back to some of the
1237040	1242400	stuff you said about postmodernism and connect it here too. But the core core movement is this,
1243920	1251280	again, like a really a vibe, as my kids would say, it's a it's a aesthetic vibe that gets at
1252240	1258480	so you might have genres on TikTok and YouTube, like YouTube reels, for example, or YouTube shorts
1259360	1264320	of these different cores, you know, I'm going to butcher some of the other ones like
1265600	1273200	home core or these different cores. And so the core core, yes, exactly, right. And of course,
1273200	1279760	in music, you've had hardcore music, metal core, you know, what's at the core. And so core core
1279840	1284720	is trying to get at like, what is at the core of cores. And these are really fascinating vignettes
1284720	1290880	into I think, like the psyche of Gen Z right now, which tends to, from my vantage point,
1290880	1296080	address the meeting crisis differently than millennials and Gen Xers did, many of much
1296080	1302880	of which I think has been marked by a sort of like comedic nihilism, where Gen Z is much more.
1302880	1307040	This is when I saw I noticed a shift happening, Brendan, it was probably my last few years of
1307040	1311920	teaching in a classroom. The biggest thing I started to notice was how differently Gen Z
1311920	1316480	was engaging the subject of September 11th from old millennials like me.
1317280	1321840	When I noticed that they were comfortable, not only comfortable, but like they loved sharing
1321840	1328720	like 9 11 memes, you know, and getting humor out of them. It was like a strange form of gallows
1328720	1333840	humor. Yeah, you know, whereas that would be almost like a sacred untouchable subject to
1333840	1339440	millennials and Gen Xers in particular, like that was so devastating. And I noticed boys in
1339440	1345200	particular, 17, 18 years old, like passed along 9 11 memes, which I like found offensive, but it
1345200	1351280	was kind of their way of processing the the anguish of living in this particular moment.
1351280	1361520	But core core, these videos are often set to like, just a really, they seem to be not coherent
1361520	1368080	scenes spliced together. But there's a general aesthetic or vibe of melancholy,
1369440	1374960	very, very depressing underneath that. And you might see spliced together scenes from kind of
1374960	1382640	these like, sigma male, anti hero figures that you see in like the literally me videos out there,
1382640	1388320	like a Patrick Bateman and scenes from those sorts of movies. But it's set to it's fascinating
1388320	1393520	because you're talking about the cultural logics of cultural logic, like what's at the core of
1393520	1402000	cores. And to me, I see that connecting to what seems to be happening for those of us who post
1402000	1408080	modernism maybe was our native tongue. And so all we knew was primarily irony, cynicism, I mean,
1408080	1411840	this at a folk level, as you mentioned already, postmodernism is far too complex, but folk
1412560	1420000	postmodernism, you know, the fight club postmodernism, the maybe the Rick and Morty postmodernism,
1420000	1429760	the that that genre, seeing at the end of that people feeling that they have, in some sense,
1429760	1437200	taken the sledgehammer of deconstruction to their overarching stories to their guiding stories,
1437200	1441840	deconstruct them all for many people. And, you know, I don't know much of your personal story,
1441840	1448080	but I'm sure there are, there's a sense in which we can both identify with the disillusionment
1448080	1456160	that many people are age experienced with traditional religion, and feeling as if there has
1456160	1464640	been a use of those stories to continue to victimize people. And when you combine that
1464640	1470160	postmodern critique, that overarching stories, mask a play for power to continue to oppress
1470160	1477200	and victimize, and then you've actually seen firsthand improper moral immoral behavior,
1477200	1484240	you've seen scandals, it seems to only strengthen that case. But I think, from my vantage point,
1484240	1489760	that that exhaustion that we feel at the end of that still leads us to this deep desire to
1489760	1501280	actually live in some sort of story. How is the metamodern shift attempting to address that desire,
1501280	1509040	that exhaustion, and that need to live in some sort of story that provides positive reconstruction,
1509040	1517200	that provides you a way of actually speaking sincerely, without throwing out all of what
1517200	1524320	have been really valid critiques of postmodernism. How does it use the language and aesthetic of
1524320	1531040	postmodernism to attempt to inhabit a meaningful story, to say things that are true, good and
1531040	1535920	beautiful once again? How do you see that working from your vantage point? Yeah, well, I think that
1536560	1544560	what you're naming is like a really significant dynamic of metamodern thought. And I think once
1544560	1550320	you see that that kind of thing is going on, that I think is sort of the answer to the question,
1550320	1555680	but it's sort of like it happens in different ways. So if broadly speaking, this postmodern
1555680	1561680	move is to deconstruct and to subject to interrogation and hermeneutics of suspicion,
1562560	1568720	and it can do that in multiple ways, including, well, we'll leave it there. So that's one thing
1568720	1573840	that it's doing, but it does differently. I think the metamodern move is sort of an attempt to say,
1573920	1579920	okay, yes, okay, now what? Let's reconstruct and let's try to, as you say, maybe live in a story
1579920	1584960	while owning it's a story or what have you, and recognizing that that happens in different ways.
1584960	1594080	So one way that I see that happening is in, well, okay, so there are different instances.
1594080	1599120	I'll use one as an example. One is everything everywhere all at once, which is a kind of
1599120	1604640	explicitly metamodern work of art. The directors, Daniel's said as much, they're like, yep,
1604640	1609440	we're aiming for like a metamodern thing here. And if you watch the movie, it's all about meaning,
1609440	1616240	it's about nihilism. It's about how do we make sense and purpose of our lives in the context of
1616240	1624000	this infinite multiverse in which anything could be anything. And one sort of the kernel of the
1624000	1630400	response there comes at the end of the movie, which is something like, nothing matters, be given
1630400	1637360	that. Therefore, everything can matter. And some people might find that rather unsatisfying. I
1637360	1641760	wouldn't entirely blame them if they did so. But that is one thing that you see. And there are
1641760	1645200	elements actually speaking of Rick and Morty in which that shows up. It's sort of like, hey, no
1645200	1650320	one's supposed to be here on purpose. There's no plan, just come and sit and hang out with your
1650320	1655520	family sort of a thing, right? So there's this move towards what you see also at the end of
1655520	1660800	everything everywhere at all at once, which is like, I, the main character chooses to be
1660800	1665840	with this particular family at this particular laundromat in this vast galaxy of universes,
1665840	1672880	because you know, this is her world essentially. So there's a, I think a move towards sort of
1672880	1677920	reaffirming the value of sort of local meaning making and sort of recognizing that things could
1677920	1683200	be an infinite number of other ways, that there's no sort of foundational ground. And yet we can
1683200	1688240	affirm the value of our lived context. You could say we can choose the story and then put a lot of
1688240	1695440	weight onto that story. Very existentialist move. It is, it is, it's, it's a, I think there, it even
1695440	1699840	goes a bit further than the existentialist to the degree that I don't know, I get the impression
1699840	1703280	from a lot of existentialist thought that there's a sense that there's still something inherently
1703280	1708560	of value in making meaning that somehow like the meaning making thing is the thing. But in this,
1708560	1713360	it's sort of like, nope, even that is just sort of, you know, you can deconstruct that, but we
1713360	1717520	still need to do these things. So there's an element to that. I see that narrative crop up in
1717520	1726000	Meta modern spaces. I see kind of similarly this sort of approach around owning the social
1726000	1730320	constructiveness of things, but again, sort of affirming that, well, this is the condition
1730320	1734800	of all knowledge. So this is just kind of how all knowledge works. And so, you know,
1734800	1738480	I grew up in this story and you grew up in this story. I think I've seen you mentioned some of
1738480	1744640	these kinds of frameworks here in some stuff you've said. And there's some recognition that
1744640	1748560	that's how things work and then just sort of owning and accepting it and then kind of living
1748560	1757920	into that story. That's another approach. I'm very interested in trying to find sort of
1758640	1764720	places where meaning actually does have some kind of a, how would I put this?
1766240	1770480	It kind of grounds out in some significant way still. So it's not just to choose your own
1770480	1776240	adventure. It's like, Oh, no, like this is this is kind of how this works, even though it admits
1776240	1782080	of a lot of variability. So like, for example, very kind of simplistically, if you want to say
1782080	1786880	that like older forms of meaning where like meaning just has objective existence, it just is,
1786880	1791360	right, like things mean, maybe that has a very kind of naive, traditional religious kind of
1791360	1795920	flavor to it. And then sort of modernity comes around and it's sort of like, well, wait a second,
1795920	1800400	we look for meaning in the world and we don't find it there. Therefore, meaning isn't objective,
1800400	1805040	it's actually just purely subjective, right? Which is an idea that I think postmodernism
1805040	1808240	takes even further in some of the ways that we're talking about, just like, yeah, we all just live
1808240	1814240	on our own story. There's a third answer to that, which is that meaning actually is real,
1814240	1818960	but it's neither purely objective or subjective. It arises in this sort of dynamic,
1818960	1823120	transjective relationship between, you know, in entity and its environment.
1823760	1828480	Yeah, more about that, Brendan, because I find that fascinating because part of my
1828480	1834240	vantage point on this would be to say that, you know, part of the modern shift was
1836160	1841520	critiquing traditional metaphysics. And then as we move further away in the
1841600	1847280	epistemological problem of how do I know anything at all, metaphysics seems to play less and less
1847280	1853600	of a role in philosophy and practically in people's lives where it's like, we can ground this in
1853600	1860320	phenomenology or other places. But whether that's sort of an agnosticism about metaphysical claims
1860320	1866240	where it's like, how could we ever know any of this at all to a more postmodern distrust of
1866240	1870080	metaphysical claims? So help me understand a little bit more when you're saying like,
1871040	1875440	you're not satisfied from your vantage point, you're not satisfied with a sort of like
1875440	1881920	Sisyphusian approach to just say, all right, I got to push this boulder up the mountain once again,
1881920	1888560	but I can choose to make it valuable by just simply deciding in this internal state that
1888560	1893120	gods can't control my internal state. So therefore I can decide that this is valuable.
1893120	1897120	Are you saying you don't, you're not satisfied with that? And you'd like,
1897680	1905840	you feel there needs to be some other grounding beyond the self? And are you saying there's a
1905840	1911680	search for that? Do you feel like both for you individually, but also within maybe the broader
1911680	1916480	metamodern shift, are people kind of going back to metaphysics for that? Are they turning,
1916480	1921920	what are they turning to to find that, that maybe that grounding outside of the self?
1921920	1927120	Yeah, yeah. No, and this I think is, this is the thing that so many people are grappling with
1927120	1937840	right now in a million different ways, right? And so, all right, yeah. So the danger as I see it
1937840	1943760	would be that we do just sort of like become aware of all these dynamics around the modern
1943760	1947760	turn and the postmodern turn and then say, ah, but we still need stories or something like that.
1947760	1953360	And then just sort of kind of, we don't carry the ideas forward. We kind of just then conclude
1953360	1959520	we have to sort of fall back on something, you know, more kind of existentially primitive to how
1959520	1965360	we were, you know, enculturated or something like that, right? So I find that unsatisfactory.
1966640	1974560	I also find sort of other approaches that do something very similar to be missing something
1974560	1979360	really crucial. And so I guess I'll just say the way I look at it, and this is informed by folks,
1979360	1984880	I just mentioned, like John Vervakey, and, you know, there's some great conversations between John
1984880	1991440	and Greg Enriquez, who has a wonderful sort of meta theory, unifying theory of knowledge.
1992880	1998080	People like Bobby Azarian, who are all operating in this metamodern space, I think that it there's a
1998080	2004640	shared solution space to these sorts of issues. And this is how I see it. It's something like
2006480	2013200	there's an entity in a context and in order for it to continue to exist, certain conditions need
2013200	2020640	to be met, you could say. And those are real, right? Like, I can't, I mean, unless you want to be
2020640	2026160	totally solipsistic or skeptical to some extreme degree and just deny the existence of, I don't
2026240	2031680	know, anything, any kind of world or something, right? You'd have to admit that like, yeah, no
2031680	2036800	one even the most ardent sort of relativistic postmodernist anti-realist is going to step outside
2036800	2040960	while it's raining and just say, it's not raining, you know what I mean? Like that doesn't fly.
2040960	2045840	So if it is raining, then you have to consider the fact of like, okay, well, this is going to make
2045840	2050880	me cold and miserable and, you know, probably I might get a cold or whatever. So you have to like
2050880	2058640	do things in relationship to reality in order to continue to successfully be an entity in the
2058640	2063360	world, right? So you're talking like emergence and emanation in some sense, right? Yeah, well,
2063360	2067920	certainly there's an emergent component to this and the emergence emanation bit, maybe I can come
2067920	2074240	back to that and see if we could plug it into that kind of a framework. But the basic idea that I
2074240	2079840	find really helpful can actually ground out in some things like as fundamentals like information
2079840	2086960	theory, thermodynamics, where you've got, okay, I am an informational entity in order to continue to
2086960	2092400	exist successfully, I need to be processing information about my environment. And I need to
2092400	2097920	do that accurately. And if that information actually is helping me maintain my viability,
2097920	2102800	then that information is meaningful to me, like full stop, like that's just, you know,
2102800	2107360	someone can't be like, I'm just going to go walk off a cliff, you know, and deny that that it's
2107360	2113600	like, nope, you won't be around anymore, right? So the knowledge of if I walk off this cliff,
2113600	2119760	I will no longer be around, that's meaningful. And at a certain point, you just can't kind of
2119760	2124560	deconstruct that anymore, you can't kind of, you know, interpretively, hermeneutically work your
2124560	2129840	way around, but it could mean this or it could mean that, right? Like, there's a to the degree that
2129840	2135840	information about the environment affects the viability of the continued persistence of a
2135920	2141840	thermodynamic entity in context. That's now, you know, now, what becomes really interesting
2141840	2146960	about that, though, is that that's a very crude, simplistic notion of meaning. I mean, you know,
2146960	2150880	the kinds of meaning that we really mean when we talk about meaning or things about like, what's
2150880	2155040	the meaning of my life and relationships and all this stuff, right? So there's, you've got to get
2155040	2159280	from this sort of very simplistic notion of meaning that you get from thermodynamics and
2159280	2164240	information theory, to the kinds of existential, philosophical, spiritual, religious meanings
2164320	2168880	that we're talking about. And so then you have to appreciate that there's a complexification
2168880	2174160	process between the two. And, and that's where things really start to get interesting when you
2174160	2180880	can situate yourself as the long end product of billions of years of complexification, where
2180880	2185440	information and entities sort of have been in this continual dance, leading to increasing
2185440	2191120	information, increasing complexity of organisms, increasing complexity of the relationship between
2191120	2195840	the two, so that meaning itself evolves and complexifies. And that's kind of the stuff I'm
2195840	2200000	exploring at the moment, which again, dovetails very much with a certain kind of strand of meta
2200000	2205200	modern thought. But it's, to ground this all back, this is, this is the same, we're trying to resolve
2205200	2209440	the same issue here, right? Which is like, how do we make meaning in this world that we supposedly
2210080	2214240	have come to realize is fully deconstructible and totally constructed and whatnot.
2215520	2219840	And are we simply making it or are we discovering it? I think that's an important question too,
2219840	2224480	right? Yeah, I think that a lot of what is coming out of the meta modern discourse space is
2225760	2230640	taking these seeming binaries and then realizing the way that it's not either or,
2230640	2237600	that there's always sort of this both and component to this. And so I think that once you have that
2237600	2243040	in mind, you can look back and see how a lot of our going astray on a lot of these issues has come
2243040	2248240	about because we absolutized a particular way of thinking about something, right? So like,
2248240	2253680	you go back and, and it's like, oh, something is true. And that's just, it's just true from the
2253680	2257920	beginning of time, it has a priori, you know, reality to it. And, you know, there's some
2257920	2262400	Platonic ideal that exists in this other world, right? And it's like, and then over time, that
2262400	2266240	all gets sort of critiqued and deconstructed. And then you get the sort of Kantian thing of like,
2266240	2271280	ah, no, it's just the mind, right? And the and reality conforms to the mind. And then you get
2271280	2276400	this radical relativism and the sort of like, total, you know, the potential for total social
2276400	2280560	constructivism, it's just sort of whatever the mind thinks is real. And both of these are very
2280560	2286080	extreme positions, right? It's sort of like, well, maybe both of these are going on simultaneously,
2286080	2290320	like maybe there are real things, but the mind needs to construct its ability to be able to
2290320	2295200	understand and relate to them. And, you know, there are frameworks for thinking in these terms,
2295200	2300720	like Piaget's constructivism, and the whole tradition of developmental psychology is like
2300800	2306800	this continual equilibration between entity and field coming to learn each other more and
2306800	2312960	more so that it's both there's a reality and the mind constructs or participates in constructing
2312960	2316880	its relationship to that reality. Both of those are true. We don't have to choose between them.
2316880	2321040	So I think a lot of the meta modern conversation is like really trying to find those points of
2321040	2326000	synthesis, which is often a synthesis between modern and postmodern extremes.
2326160	2331840	I see what you're talking about here, Brendan, is also having a point of connection to what
2331840	2337600	maybe both modernism and postmodernism were doing, especially in American culture with the
2337600	2343760	elevation of the atomized individual, right? So if in modernism, the individual, well, you know,
2343760	2348160	we could take this all the way back to the Protestant Reformation, where Luther trusts
2348160	2352880	his gut over and against the hierarchical institutions of the past, which were the place
2352880	2358320	in which you did have access to the truth. That was the narrative, right? So the rejection of
2358880	2365200	locating it through the hierarchical institutions and in the individual gets us, obviously, to
2365200	2372720	Descartes. But then the postmodern impulse has been to not only critique, you know, we're not
2372720	2378800	just doing like Descartes, I think, therefore I am, but there's also the sense in which because
2378800	2384720	all narratives are a play for power that maybe, especially as this takes shape in American culture,
2384720	2390320	that I can author my own narrative. I can radically self-author in a way that
2392240	2398400	there is no necessarily external reality to which I have to conform to. The only thing I'm trying
2398400	2404320	to conform to and maybe even conform the world outside of me to actually match what I believe
2404320	2409280	my internal state is. Yeah, yeah. No, and you see this all the time with the way that language has
2409280	2413600	become so important. We have to police language now because there's this thought that, you know,
2413600	2417520	oh, well, if we just change the words, we'll change reality. Like if someone doesn't have a
2417520	2422400	word for something and we just obliterate that from our conceptions, then this will lead in, you
2422400	2429920	know, some miraculously better world. And so there is very much like that kind of, you know,
2429920	2435680	the way that we are tone policing and word policing and cancelling each other and sort of
2435680	2441280	not engaging with these ideas and sort of just cutting off conversation at that level is a direct
2441280	2447760	outgrowth of a certain worldview which says that we create reality. And so if we can change people's
2447760	2454320	minds, then we'll change reality. And so obviously that is misguided and not entirely true, right?
2454320	2458400	But there's a kernel of truth to it. Like we can change the way we speak about things and maybe
2458400	2464960	that would have a moderately better impact on society. So again, it's just this escape from
2464960	2470800	either or thinking of like we have to choose one side of this polarity when in fact what I can,
2470800	2476480	I see is very emblematic of all metamodern thought as sort of this continual moving between
2477200	2481840	these different polarities. And this is a sense of what the word meta means actually, meta can
2481840	2487840	mean between. And one of the ways that the original Dutch theorists use the term related directly
2487840	2492240	to that is that the metamodern mind is always oscillating is the word that they use between
2492880	2499200	sort of these postmodern views of things and these modern views of things. And for the record too,
2499200	2503280	I think also it's important for the context of this conversation, not just the modern. I mean,
2503280	2508400	like, let's say other cultural logics, it's oscillating between on the one hand, it can kind of
2508400	2512720	take that social constructivist angle. But then, you know, when that starts getting too extreme and
2512720	2516880	just sort of ridiculous in terms of where it falls apart with reality, then it can kind of
2516960	2520080	reaffirm that, well, no, there is something here, right? But there's this back and forth that's
2520080	2524640	sort of continually setting those different lenses in relationship to each other so that
2524640	2529280	you're getting some dynamic third thing rather than just, you know, one of these two extremes.
2530560	2536080	So I think, yeah, you see that, you see that in all areas of sort of, you know, this metamodern shift.
2537120	2540720	Do you think maybe I'm just kind of spitballing here at the top of my head as we're talking,
2540720	2551040	do you think there's any possibility that maybe what we have learned is, as we look at the kind
2551040	2557840	of Hegelian, here's the synthesis, here's the antithesis, and we've seen as we've gone back that
2557840	2564560	how strongly people have said the antithesis is the truth, you know, up against the synthesis that
2564560	2569520	maybe what metamodernism is trying to do is trying to like predict in advance where the
2569600	2577280	new synthesis is going to land, maybe by doing that oscillation between the thesis and the
2577280	2584000	antithesis. In this case, it would be the primary thesis and antithesis of modernism and
2584000	2589920	postmodernism, right? So modernism, and maybe even going before that, the traditional storytelling,
2589920	2596400	traditional worldview, that you have that sort of thesis, postmodernism being the antithesis
2596400	2602240	and metamodernism, obviously seeking to find that the synthesis in advance, instead of just
2602240	2608640	letting this collision maybe devolve into a total state of war and anarchy and complete
2608640	2614080	disillusionment, do you think there's any merit to that possibility?
2614080	2621040	Yeah, I mean, I think it's a very helpful way of thinking about it, that it's becoming aware of
2621040	2627600	the dialectical nature of this is at least the crucial part, right? If you are only able to
2627600	2634640	conceive of opposite binaries, you're in a different position. If you're able to cognize, oh,
2634640	2640320	I'm between a rock and hard place, I'm between two opposite poles, and they might actually
2640320	2645040	relate to one another, and they might actually maybe even sort of complement each other or have a
2645360	2653200	opponent processing factor that maybe, and once you're in that mindset, I think you've already
2653200	2657920	made that move, and I think you're right. I mean, there's an anticipation factor of like, okay, well,
2657920	2662240	then what does it look like to sort of bring together these seemingly opposite things?
2663120	2666400	So anyway, that's a very helpful framing. There are all sorts of ways of framing it,
2667120	2673360	and I don't want to reify any particular one as though this is the right metamodern, because
2673440	2678320	there's these dynamics that are very deep, and we can represent them in different ways.
2679120	2685280	Modern or thesis into this, a synthesis is one way of doing that, but we can also do more traditional
2685280	2691840	Hegelian dialectics. We can talk about basically things going meta on themselves, or I talk about
2691840	2698320	eternal recursion, the sort of continual standing back and self-reflecting on what was before,
2698880	2705520	but I think what they all gesture to is that it's aware of the fact that we are presented with
2705520	2712560	these contraries and building that into the perspective itself, that like perspectives
2712560	2718800	are often mediating what came before in terms of seeming opposites, and they need to ideally
2718800	2721920	bring these together and find where they can productively relate to one another.
2722240	2728320	Okay, can we circle back around, because when you're talking about I think the desire to
2730240	2736720	find meaning outside of the self in something, I don't want to go as far as to say objective
2736720	2744560	truth, but to ground it in a, let's say using other philosophical language, the recognition that
2744560	2750000	I am not necessary, but I am contingent, and I'm dependent on some other necessary necessity
2750080	2756880	beyond myself. I think that is part of the awareness that there are forces at play,
2757440	2761360	and this is where for me I wanted to circle back around to what you're talking about, because it
2761360	2766720	seems like this dance that Viveki has been talking about for quite some time between
2766720	2773920	emergence and emanation, so emanation being kind of like the top down, the thing outside of ourselves
2773920	2782480	that provides the constraints, the playground, if you will, for which we can conform and have
2782480	2788000	that bottom-up causality, but the bottom-up causality isn't that, and I think this is really,
2788000	2792160	I know this is going to sound for some of my listeners like we're getting too far into the
2792160	2798240	philosophical weeds here, but I do think there are practical existential daily life stuff connected
2798240	2805200	to this, that if we see ourselves as having nothing outside of ourselves to conform to,
2805200	2811200	like there's no reality, there's no playground, there's no fence to inhabit, there's no space,
2811200	2819680	there's no container to be poured into that it creates what again like Viveki has called
2819680	2825040	combinatorial explosion, which is part of our problem, like we feel like we can, I don't know
2825040	2831280	if you follow any of like, what's his name, Byung Chul Han, any of his work at all,
2832080	2840080	golly, I'm drawing a blank on his book titles, but he's talked about this shift into
2840080	2845280	an achievement society, an achievement society in which we feel the constant need
2845280	2851040	to optimize ourselves, but the problem is that we have endless, seemingly endless options for
2851040	2855760	optimization. So there aren't constraints. And we feel like as part of our narrative,
2855760	2861680	we can make ourselves whatever we want, but we don't know what good thing to make ourselves to.
2862320	2869760	So there's like a, there is the recognition of some sort of top down constraint, top down
2871120	2878720	thing to adhere to. Is that a fair way of maybe assessing what some of what the metamodern impulse
2878720	2885840	is to find some proper container while still recognizing the critiques of postmodernism that
2885840	2891920	I recognize and I tell this to people, Brendan, like I'm a pastor, I recognize that if I was born
2891920	2899280	in Somalia, I would the statistical likelihood of me being a Christian pastor is infinitesimally
2899280	2905840	small. I recognize I was born into the story. I'm self aware of the story, but I am also trying to
2905920	2913760	be honest about, okay, given that I can't live without a story, I have to adhere to some structure
2913760	2920000	and I'm earnestly searching to allow myself to adhere to some structure that I see is true.
2920000	2925920	I'm not trying to be blind to it. It seems like what I've noticed in our generation is like the
2925920	2934320	tiredness, the exhaustion of nothing but cynicism, nothing but irony, irony that isn't like leading
2934320	2939440	to sincerity. And we have this new impulse that goes, all right, I'm still going to use my ironic
2939440	2947440	language, but I am trying to find a container, like I'm trying to find the top down force that I
2947440	2954240	should adhere to. Right. Yeah. So, okay, this will get a little trippy maybe and maybe a little weird.
2954240	2958880	Let's do it. Let's get trippy. So I remember this episode of Boy Meets World where-
2958880	2963360	Let's go there. Well, one of my favorites. Yeah, yeah, speaking of, yeah. And all right,
2963360	2967760	so in this episode, it's the older brother. I want to say his name is Will, but maybe that's
2967760	2974480	the name of the actor. I forget the name of the older brother. Eric? Eric, yes, Eric. Cory's older
2974480	2982240	brother goes off to Hollywood because he's gotten into acting and while he's there, he stars in a
2982240	2991760	television sitcom pilot called Kid Gets Acquainted with the Universe. And on the set, it's all the
2991760	2995600	same characters from Boy Meets World, but they're like, they have slightly different names and
2995600	3000000	he's playing a character, you know, named Derek or something, right? So it's this, it's, and sorry,
3000000	3005920	so this is what you would call going meta, okay? And on some way, right? Now, when you watch this,
3005920	3009360	you're like, this is a spoof. It's a joke. It's sort of like a, there's no way to,
3010320	3014240	they're being cheekily self-aware, right? And they're breaking the fourth wall and all this stuff.
3014240	3018960	And all these things have characteristic elements of postmodern art. You see this a lot in postmodern
3018960	3025200	art of just being very hyper self-conscious, where the, where a book becomes about reading the book,
3025200	3029120	right? That sort of a thing or like, you know, the author is telling you that he's writing the
3029120	3033440	current sentence that he's writing, right? These are all meta moves that you find in kind of classic,
3033440	3038880	postmodern works of art. And a lot of the kind of immediate takeaway from some of that stuff,
3038880	3044960	right, is, oh, okay, yeah, all this stuff is kind of just silly. And it makes me very aware of this
3044960	3049200	thing. It's sort of, I don't even have the illusion of like, you know, suspension of disbelief. I'm
3049200	3054000	just like, it's putting it all in my face. It's a construct. It's not real, all that. And that can be
3054000	3058320	sort of disenchanting and disillusioning and sort of, yeah, then you're kind of being ironic, okay?
3059120	3065120	But now here's where I want to kind of get a little trippy with this. Then you kind of really
3065120	3070640	go with it. And then you work with that move, because you do see it is a move. Like that's
3070640	3078720	what postmodern art is doing all the time in all sorts of things. The Simpsons have other
3078720	3083280	television shows on that like dinosaurs or family guy that they have send ups of because they're
3083280	3086480	like, hey, wow, these guys are so much like us, right? It's sort of like, okay, we're going to do
3086480	3092720	this meta move, right? So this is a move. But once you see that it's a move, you have a new
3093600	3099600	enduring container, right? You have a new thing that exists. And so then you can say, oh, well,
3099600	3106240	what is the nature of that container? Well, it's this recursive move that has a deep kind of
3106240	3110640	structure to it. And it repeats itself and it reflects on itself. Now, once you have that,
3110640	3116560	you're like, this is a real thing, right? I'm not just like, we've deconstructed something,
3116560	3122240	but we've deconstructed it using a thing that is not deconstructed. You know, it's a real
3123200	3128800	mental move that you make that that is, it's the container for deconstruction. You see what I'm
3128800	3133680	saying? So it's like, you've gotten beyond deconstruction, meta deconstruction, because
3133680	3138240	you're actually seeing the very container that deconstruction needs to even be able to do what
3138240	3143200	it's doing. And once you're there, you can start to say, Hey, there are things that exist outside
3143200	3148480	the context of just infinite, you know, sort of cultural constructivist deconstruction, there are
3149360	3154720	the containers in which these things happen. And that provides a new kind of solid ground to work
3154720	3159440	with. But you have to go through it to get there, you have to deconstruct in order to get outside
3159440	3165280	of the container. So what I posit is that this postmodern moment is very much where we're still
3165280	3171280	stuck in the deconstructing move, we haven't kept going, we haven't gotten beyond it. And so we're
3171280	3175760	stuck with the disenchantment and the disillusionment and the cynicism and the irony. But if you keep
3175760	3183440	going, then that is that very stuff is what allows you to find a new kind of meta level container.
3183520	3188320	So that would be a way of beginning to think about the sorts of moves that go into
3189680	3193520	these sorts of things. And I can say more about meaning as sort of a, you know, a similar move,
3193520	3200160	but that would just be one way of framing it. Okay, so then, if Meta Modernism is trying to find
3201840	3209360	the container that holds the deconstruction, yeah, is that a fair way of summarizing that?
3210080	3216880	I mean, as I say, right, all Meta Modernisms or the Meta Modern quintessentially is about going
3216880	3222320	beyond postmodernism by means of postmodernism. So whatever you're going to find on the other
3222320	3228560	side is going to be somehow a meaningful product of postmodernism, but it's going to also transcend
3228560	3234080	it as well. And so this is a classic example of how that would work, because you have to go
3234080	3238560	through the deconstruction process to then find the new stable structure. I wouldn't go so far
3238560	3244480	as to say that all forms of Meta Modernism are somehow about trying to do this. I think that
3244480	3249360	this is a, this is, this is, and I do, I mean, this is the case I'm making in my book because
3249360	3254880	to talk about a cultural logic of cultural logics is kind of where you get on, you know, get to on
3254880	3260400	the other side of this stuff is that you see that, oh, there's a structure to how cultural
3260400	3266480	logics themselves evolve, right? So Meta Modernism is also about this move in the sense that it's
3266560	3271840	aware of how this process unfolds. So it's able to see that, oh, postmodernism is actually a
3271840	3277440	necessary step in this process because it's, it's key to how this whole thing operates. But then
3277440	3282560	you're able to contextualize that and you're able to relativize relativism, you know, you're able
3282560	3286880	to be skeptical of skepticism and you're able to deconstruct deconstruction because you put it in a
3286880	3292640	wider frame. So that to me seems to be like a really necessary, you know, way of thinking about
3292640	3297600	all this. And when I synthesized all the different ways people were talking about Meta Modernism,
3298320	3302080	that is sort of the underlying structure to all these different kinds of discourse seems to be
3302080	3309120	this basic move. So that, that is the, the basic idea. And I think what I would say though,
3310640	3318400	so I want to tie this into the meaning issue, which I think would be valuable, but I also
3318400	3321200	recognize that there's a lot, there's a lot to all this. So I don't know if we want to,
3321200	3327440	you know, get a little bit sure first. Yeah, no, no, I'd like to talk about that. The only
3327440	3331680	other pressing question I have, Brennan, you can pick which one you'd like to address first is
3331680	3338240	thinking about what sorts of implications that this getting at the core of cores, the container
3338240	3348480	of containers, what, what this, what this shift, this impulse, what kind of impact it has on like
3348480	3359440	traditional religion in America. Because I've wondered how much of the, the shift towards
3361040	3366240	little autobiographical, and then you can choose which way you want to take this, you know, so I
3366240	3372800	think back to my parents, my parents who were, my dad was raised kind of nominally Catholic,
3372800	3378480	my mom was raised devoutly Catholic. They saw that in some sense as the thesis
3378480	3384400	with all of the flaws that they perceived in that thesis. And then when they got into their
3384400	3390480	early adult years, they, they chose this kind of new thing at the time, which was this born-again
3390480	3395600	Billy Graham evangelical experience, very personal. So we're going to move away from,
3395600	3399280	you know, at the time there already shifts happening because it's post Vatican II from
3399280	3404400	Latin mass, but they want to hear the Bible in their native tongue. And they want to read
3404400	3410000	Bible translations that sound like their cultural context and the music that's going to happen in
3410000	3416800	church isn't organs. And from the medieval times, there's not doing the smells and bells, we're
3416800	3422640	not doing that stuff. We actually want to communicate with the cultural vocabulary of our day. And so
3422640	3428880	they very much grew up in that. I'm a product of that, but I see a lot of people that their parents
3428880	3435680	went through that sort of change. And then they grow up and then they go to like Eastern Orthodoxy
3436320	3444560	or Catholicism or, you know, the more high church liturgical expressions. There's a lot of
3444560	3450000	different ways we could frame that, but I'm really wondering how much of that, you know,
3450000	3456240	is that simply kind of, you can kind of see these recurring patterns throughout time of people going,
3456320	3460720	Hey, you know, I came from this and I want to go back to something before that.
3461440	3469760	Is that metamodern? What what sorts of impacts do you see as these stories disseminate in through
3469760	3475280	popular culture as the aesthetic changes and those aesthetic changes begin to impact, not just
3475280	3480080	guys like you and me who are reading this stuff and not to pat ourselves on the back, but we're
3480080	3485760	not normal when it comes to when it comes to like picking up on these trends. I would like to think
3485760	3491200	that I'll speak of you that you're very much on the front end of this, this, this bleeding edge and
3491200	3496000	this, I don't think if you asked your average person on the streets, like what metamodernism is,
3496000	3503120	they'd be like, yeah, I have no, I have no idea. So as that moves more into the mainstream and moves
3503120	3508080	into broader culture, what sorts of impacts do you see it having on traditional religion? And,
3508080	3512720	you know, feel free if you feel like that connects to what you want to say about the pursuit of
3512720	3517840	meaning. Sure, there is something there. Yeah. No, I'll tackle that one. And it's so interesting
3517840	3521520	too, because you described that whole thing you described, I have a direct experience with that
3521520	3528000	as well. You know, my, my previous, well, my family, my parents basically had that experience,
3528000	3532320	grew up in, you know, mainline churches, found the evangelical thing, because it was the antithesis
3532320	3537760	to the thesis. And I was that next generation that was very fascinated by Eastern Orthodox
3537840	3544720	Christianity. I mean, one thing I'll say is, you know, they say that every
3545360	3551040	problem looks like a nail to a hammer, right? So I'm a metamodernist thinker. So there's a danger
3551040	3555600	of trying to interpret all these sorts of patterns and culture as somehow, you know, whatever. And
3555600	3559440	I don't want to, I don't want to. Hammer away. Hammer away, Brendan. This is what I called you
3559440	3566720	here for. But so, yeah, I want to avoid the trap of, you know, of doing that. I will say, though,
3567440	3574480	there's an interesting way, right, about how, like the attraction, say, to Eastern Orthodoxy
3574480	3579600	after coming from an evangelical context is different than if you made the reverse move.
3579600	3585040	Do you see what I'm saying? It's because, right, like, I do think that there's this metamodern
3585040	3591120	aspect here in which there's a deep pragmatism as well that I think informs a lot of metamodern
3591120	3595520	thought, which stems from the same insight, right, of like, well, we got to live with some story,
3595520	3599600	right? You know, so it's sort of like a pragmatic realization that you're
3599600	3603440	are between a rock and a hard place, and you just got to choose because you got to get on with your
3603440	3608400	life and you have to have some meaning in it. So there is a pragmatism there. And I think that
3608400	3614960	there is a kind of attraction to certain kinds of religiosity from the standpoint of, damn it,
3614960	3621440	I want to be religious, you know, and I, it's almost like, you know, I don't want to say it's
3621440	3627120	as flippant as, you know, flip a coin, literally, but there's some sense of like, I need this element
3627120	3631920	in my life, and I want to choose this, and I'm attracted to these aesthetics, right? And so I
3631920	3636480	will engage with this thing as it gives me this value. But that's a very reflective stance to,
3636480	3640880	like, adopt a religious tradition for. It's very different if you were to grow up in the
3640880	3646080	tradition itself and just like, get the experience of this is the truth, and this is the way that
3646080	3650240	reality is, you'd have to deconstruct that before you'd even be able to get in the position where
3650240	3657200	you could authentically, agentially, volitionally choose the thing that you're in. And oftentimes,
3657200	3661440	to be fair, a lot of the places that we're coming from, we're often trying so hard to distance
3661440	3665600	ourselves from that it's going to be very unlikely that we're going to end back in the place once
3665600	3670400	we've done all that work that we have done so much to get away from, though some people do.
3670400	3677360	And I could very well conceive of, you know, a situation where people leave, or let's say that
3677360	3686000	people find a form of the religiosity that I left and affirm it from a metamodern standpoint for
3686000	3689360	all the reasons that we're talking about. But you have to see, and the point I'm making is that
3689360	3693680	they're different then, right? That it's different. And a lot of it has to do with the degree of
3693680	3699440	reflection, which is, again, the sort of recursive reflection and this reflective move that we're
3699440	3703040	always doing with things. It's sort of we're learning from them. We're able to take them as
3703040	3707360	an objective analysis. We're able to, you know, not just look through our glasses, but look at
3707360	3713520	our glasses and then go from that vantage, right? So I think a lot of, you know, the move here is
3714400	3718720	when you grow up, when you're enculturated, and when you're learning things, like your whole
3718720	3723760	formative period of life for the first, say, 20 years, a lot of it is just being taught how to
3723760	3731440	see through a certain pair of glasses, right? And then in time, you might very well come to
3731440	3736240	realize that that way of seeing isn't complete, that it is a pair of glasses that you can take
3736240	3740720	off and analyze. And then you do that for a while. And maybe that occupies a lot of your, you know,
3740720	3744800	I don't know, early 20s and whatever. But then eventually you're like, okay, yep, that's how
3744800	3748880	this whole thing works. And, you know, you know, now it's like, which pair of glasses am I going
3748880	3753840	to wear? And why? That's right. You can't go without that lens. There's always the interpretive lens.
3753840	3758240	So the awareness of that to me seems like a differentiating factor between just like,
3758320	3763600	I'm leaving this thing because I'm upset or I'm hurt for valid reasons or non valid reasons,
3763600	3768240	whatever the case may be. And I'm running away from this thing. That seems very different than
3768240	3774720	going, Oh, I've taken off my glasses, I realize I have an interpretive lens. And then you go and
3774720	3778160	you take that one set off, and then you put on another pair. And then you realize, Oh, shoot.
3778800	3785120	Wait, this is also has these filters. Yes. Right. Yes. Now, this is where things start
3785120	3788400	to become very interesting as well, though, because all right, a couple things here, let's say I have
3788400	3792800	some rose colored glasses on, right? And I'm like, Oh, yes, the world is so rosy. Now, of course,
3792800	3797440	I wouldn't say that because everything is rosy. So it's all contextually viewed through that lens,
3797440	3800800	right? But then someone comes around and they tell me, Hey, actually, you're just viewing through a
3800800	3804400	pair of rose colored glasses. And to the degree that I don't just immediately shoot them away,
3804400	3807920	because they're challenging my sense of reality and get very defensive about that and actually
3807920	3812000	take it seriously. Then I might go through the whole thing of like learning to take them off,
3812000	3817040	look at them, find another pair over here. And this has a green lens and then try those on,
3817040	3821920	right? And I think that I guess one of the things I want to say is one, that movement I think is
3821920	3829600	the movement from sort of naive traditionalism or naive religiosity into a sort of modern critical
3829600	3836480	stance where we're able to take religion itself as a subject as an object of criticism and study.
3836560	3842640	And so that would be starting to do this, right? And then the postmoderns come along and they're
3842640	3848000	like, Oh, okay, yeah. But here's all these other glasses you could choose from. And so
3849200	3854320	so it's all relative, right? It's all totally random, right? Now, here's where the thing really
3854320	3858320	starts to click, I think, is that then once you take that serious, you're like, Wow, there are
3858320	3864000	all these different kinds of glasses I could be wearing. And then you say, I can put them all
3864000	3869520	on and I can compare them, I can put them all on and adjudicate between them. Some of them are
3869520	3875040	showing aspects better than others, maybe, maybe some prescriptions closer to my eyes or whatever.
3875040	3879360	There are certain aspects in which I'm getting new elements of what is there through different
3879360	3885440	kinds of glasses. But even bigger than that, one becomes aware of this whole meta move that it's
3885440	3890000	the case that we're all wearing glasses, we can all become aware of it, we can all take them off,
3890000	3894800	study them, and then see the ways in which we're wearing various forms of glasses. And that that
3894800	3901120	then becomes, you could say, a new set of glasses that seems like it's absolute that you're now
3901120	3905120	you're looking through the world through the lens of lenses, right? You're you've got a cultural
3905120	3909360	logic of cultural logics because that's what that's what this is. It's sort of like, what are these
3909360	3914720	different lenses? Well, they're different religions, they're different ideologies. But more than that,
3914720	3921920	they're different sort of degrees of of of perspectival awareness, you could even say.
3921920	3927200	And so you start to see that what all of these things have in common is that it's better to
3928000	3933280	have more knowledge of more glasses and to be able to go through the process itself of adjudicating
3933280	3940480	that. And that there's something that feels closer to like truth about that whole meta process,
3940480	3946960	right? And so you're able to allow you to have some sort of comparison. If you say,
3947600	3954640	as I've tried on 12 different sets of glasses, I notice some similar features shared,
3954640	3962400	maybe that's pointing to some, you know, core of cores here that that actually is revealing
3962400	3967920	something that is true across these perspectives, right? There's there's not only the fact that
3967920	3971760	you can then compare perspectives and see what they have in common and then be in a better position
3971760	3975360	to say, you know, well, that's real. And I think to some degree, modernism has already kind of
3975360	3980080	engaged in projects like that. But I think what's even the bigger move is seeing that there's this
3980080	3986720	meta pattern of lens analysis, you know what I mean? That that that that the whole thing itself
3986720	3994800	provides a way to adjudicate between perspectives. And because, right, when you put on a pair of
3994800	4001040	glasses, and you can't see that people are wearing glasses, those glasses aren't telling you as much
4001040	4006240	about reality as a pair of glasses where you put them on and you do see that, right? This is where
4006240	4009200	the analogy falls apart a little bit because glasses can't do all this. But you understand what I'm
4009200	4013200	saying, right? That there's something intrinsically valuable about the art of deconstructing a
4013200	4019680	worldview in a perspective in order to then see beyond it. And then to get to the meta perspective
4019680	4026800	of seeing the process of worldview construction and deconstruction itself, which then provides you
4026800	4032160	some some solid thing that you can compare all worlds to, if that makes sense. So that gives you
4032160	4037920	this meta pattern that's sort of a new rubric or a new measure or universal scale or something,
4037920	4043200	right? And this is what I mean when I talk about meaning and the complexification of meaning and
4043200	4048880	all this stuff, because this is this is something quite different than, you know, oh, we all just
4048880	4052960	live in a story, so we might as well choose one, which is still very inflected by postmodern
4052960	4057760	relativism to, well, we've gone through postmodern relativism, and now we're able to
4057760	4062560	relativize it within a broader process that is sort of a still actually universal process.
4063680	4069280	Now, hopefully, one, people are with me on any of this, and it's making sense to
4070560	4076320	I want to qualify that as well, because I don't immediately once you see that this is this process,
4076400	4081600	you see that it keeps going, right? There's no clear end to this process. It has a kind of
4082160	4087840	self-transcending quality to it. And so there should be some epistemic humility that we have
4087840	4091440	here, that even though we have this sort of universal scale, like, well, how many perspectives
4091440	4096080	can we can we see and that that's real and that that's not just, oh, you know, whatever you want to
4096080	4102560	believe. We also shouldn't say that even this whole perspective won't be transcended in some
4102560	4107280	other meta, meta level where we put on a new set of glasses. And I can understand how that might
4107280	4112080	make people uncomfortable, because it seems like the solid ground that we just got from this sort
4112080	4115760	of thing is now immediately then torn out from under us. But I also want to invite people to
4115760	4122240	think about this as a mystery, as the mystery of reality that I think personally I see as a sacred
4122240	4127360	process. And when I start marrying this idea of how the development of knowledge works and the
4127360	4134160	connection with reality to certain forms of apophatic mysticism, there's fascinating connections
4134160	4140000	there to be made in terms of like an eternally disclosing world, a reality that is becoming more
4140000	4146400	and more clearly known by people, even as it's also always receding away in this ultimate mystery,
4146400	4151920	which I think is, you know, if you're a believing person, shouldn't be any great discomfort either.
4151920	4156400	There's just, there is sort of this. And so this is, this is what I want to tie back into
4156400	4161200	the emanation bit, you know, so what I'm talking about is emergence. Every time you take off the
4161200	4165680	glass and come to this whole new conception of reality, you've like gone through an emergent
4165680	4169680	phase shift, and you're seeing things in like a totally different way, things have new, your
4169680	4174000	knowledge has been restructured and reorganized, and you've got a new, you know, that's emergence,
4174000	4179680	that's bottom up kind of self transcendence. But there is this thing that sort of on the other
4179680	4184800	end of this whole process that we're moving towards in doing that. And that's the emanation
4184800	4189040	bit. And that's a lot harder to speak about, right? And that's where I want to locate that
4189040	4194960	emanation aspect. And you can call that God, you can use, you know, the imagery of the Bible to
4194960	4201600	talk about it. And you can, and I think I think we should draw on the experience of the mystics and
4202320	4205600	the mystical literature, especially in the Christian tradition to think about this.
4206000	4212640	But I think that that's, that's the, that's the mystery of it to me. And I think we're,
4212640	4219280	where this stops being a purely sort of cultural analysis, or kind of epistemological speculation
4219280	4224800	and starts to become a kind of devotional relationship to the ground of being in the
4224800	4230000	infinitely self emanating abundance of the fullness of the one or something like that.
4230960	4238080	Yeah. So with that mystery, there's maybe a couple of different existential responses
4238080	4244800	to that, to the confession of the ultimate transcendence of the ground of being, right,
4244800	4250880	that there is in the Eastern Orthodox tradition, you're more apt to use the apophatic language
4250880	4256160	of what God is not, than what he is, so that you don't constrain the possibilities of the
4256160	4261760	transcendent. And yet, there's a real problem there with combinatorial explosion, with decision
4261760	4266640	fatigue and a sense of decision paralysis, where you can get to the point where the mystery becomes
4266640	4271840	so grand, you don't know where to take a first step. And I think that's, that would be a concerning
4271840	4277520	feature of, okay, so the metamodernism, metamodern shift, if you accept some of these
4278480	4287600	presuppositions, if you accept where, what's the word I'm looking for, if you accept where the,
4287600	4293280	because it's not even just, I don't want to reduce this to like, here are, here are propositional,
4293280	4297600	here's propositional knowledge about the world, you know, because it's very much connected to,
4297600	4301680	when you watch these core core videos, for example, it's not propositional, it's aesthetic,
4302560	4309760	it's a vibe. So where's the vibe? Where's the vibe leading you? I'm very optimistic about the
4309760	4316960	possibility that in this moment, people are very open to positive reconstruction. That for me is
4316960	4323280	like a win. But I'm also confessing my conviction of location on this as somewhat of a Kierkegaardian
4323280	4327920	Christian, and that I'm like, yes, there is something, there's something at the edge of this
4327920	4334640	doc, you know, and this is maybe to use another metaphor or picture that we can, let's say, take
4336080	4342960	the reasons for believing that there is something positive to reconstruct into, that there is a
4342960	4346800	core of cores, that there's a container of containers. No, I think I know where you're
4346800	4350240	getting at. So, well, I don't want to interrupt you, though, so please finish your thought. But I
4350240	4354400	think, okay, so let me just throw this out there then to you, Brendan, then you can please provide
4354400	4359120	your feedback and comments on it. But for me, the way I picture it is this sense that
4359920	4366960	there is enough general revelation to use my Christian theological language to lead me to,
4366960	4371840	as like what Paul would argue in Romans one, that God's invisible attributes are
4371840	4376960	your on display within the material world that's been created. And there's enough reason to believe
4376960	4381760	that there is a core of cores, there's a container of containers, there is, and you could go through
4381760	4388640	all the Aristotelian, you know, the five reasons of Augustine or not Augustine of Aquinas, for
4388640	4392880	an Aristotle, for believing in all of that stuff. But it still leads you to this point
4394000	4400560	of which irrationality is not enough that you have to enter into the suprarational. And this,
4400560	4408720	for me, is again kind of a Kierkegaard disciple. This is where that leap of faith from the edge
4408720	4414000	of the dock into the ocean that stands in front of you is the only way that you can know whether
4414000	4419600	or not you will swim is when you actually move from here, the propositions that I've been built
4419600	4424880	upon. And now I have to actually like give of myself. And so for like Kierkegaard, this is the
4424880	4432320	only way that one actually truly comes to know Christ, to know God is in that decisive leap
4432320	4438000	of faith, the actual movement. So I think you're probably tracking with me on this, Brendan. The
4438000	4443440	question then for some that come out of this, they go, I want to reconstruct, I want to positively
4443440	4450160	reconstruct. Where do I take the leap? Is there a leap? You know, with that leap also comes the
4450160	4455600	risk, I don't want to leap into the wrong thing. You know, I still have to hold to the what we've
4455600	4461920	learned from postmodernism that maybe that story I'm leaping into is just simply masking a play
4461920	4466320	for power. I think the one for me, Brendan, I have no problem talking about this. This is me
4466320	4471440	confessing that I know I'm situated in a story is like, you know, the Nietzschean critique that
4471440	4477200	this is nothing more than slave morality. It's a it's a poignant critique, you know, that this
4477200	4482720	story is a great story if you want to remain on the underside and the bottom side of history all
4482720	4491200	the time. And so to encourage people in my vocation to take that leap, I take it very, very seriously,
4491200	4498720	you know. So mystery, the searching for the core of cores, the meta beyond the meta.
4500000	4507520	How do we move beyond the sense of paralysis and decision fatigue into actually stepping into
4507520	4511520	something that we could positively reconstruct name that we're positively constructing, or are we
4511520	4518160	just kind of stuck with our same old epistemology problems? I think there's a couple of related
4518240	4523120	questions in there. And I'll tackle one first, and it might answer all of them, I'm not sure. But
4523120	4528960	I actually love this image of the core of cores. So we'll take that in a very sincerely ironic way
4528960	4533280	and like really run with it. Okay, so like imagine a mandala, right? It's sort of a series of
4533280	4539520	concentric circles, right? And when you think about that structure, you can see that it's sort of
4539520	4543200	like a, you know, you can also think of it in sort of a Venn diagram way that like, you know,
4543200	4547680	what's at the center is sort of in all of the things, right? Now, if you think about this
4547680	4552080	complexification thing I've been talking about, and which relates directly, by the way, to being
4552080	4556320	able to see more and more perspectives and more and more lenses, that you see that the
4556320	4560240	complexification of meaning gets us to these places. And so we're taking in more and more
4560240	4565520	perspectives. But then the question is, what's the core of cores? If there were a core of cores,
4567440	4574880	then we would have good cause to, let's say, always be able to rest in something. I want to
4574880	4581280	come back and qualify this in a second. But what I want to suggest is love. It's not, I don't think
4581280	4585600	of this so much as a leap of faith, which for me still rings with all this propositional logic and
4585600	4594000	maybe even some kind of relational interpersonal logic or something. But love is the vibe. Okay,
4594000	4600480	you know, love is the vibe. And, and what I mean by that is that it's true at all levels,
4600480	4605520	right? That there's no point where you can get to the complexification of something or you get
4605520	4610080	to a new perspective. And all of a sudden, you're totally justified to be an asshole, you know,
4610080	4616560	doesn't work that way. There's like, you can go down to the most, you know, simple, or pure,
4616560	4622080	or whatever kind of, you know, language you want to use for this kind of, even very naive faiths.
4622080	4628560	And you'll find agape and eros and other kinds of love, phyllo. But you'll find the sense of
4628640	4633280	connection, of harmony, of moving, of wanting to bring together and to unite. And, you know,
4633280	4636960	then you can start getting into theologies of love and everything, which Kierkegaard did too.
4637520	4642800	But, but that, but you can also then zoom out, right? And you can also see that there's this,
4642800	4648080	this operates to at like, you know, these levels that we're talking about of metamodern,
4648080	4655440	self reflexive recursivity and all this stuff. But it's like, we're still engaged in a connection
4655440	4662400	that is not lost or torn asunder by the complexification of it all. And that actually,
4662960	4667680	as you're able to see more and more of reality and see more and more perspectives and more and more
4667680	4672000	of the truth, and as that reality discloses itself to you, and you have more pieces and parts to
4672000	4677520	work with, the love is what is binding all those pieces together, so that you're seeing just more
4677600	4680720	and more of the way that love, you know, as Dante would say, you know,
4681920	4689840	causes the planets to dance around the stars. So that would be my initial answer is that the vibe
4689840	4696400	is love and the core of cores is love. And, and that you can think about that as being the thing
4696400	4700480	that binds those together. Now, fascinating, or maybe bizarre as it may sound, this was something
4700480	4706080	I've got from synthesizing metamodernisms, at least, you know, what I would, a pattern I was
4706080	4711280	picking up in a lot of people talking about this, you've got Alexander Dumitrescu talking about,
4711280	4715520	you know, this sort of kindness and Jacob's Ladder, you've got Vermeulen and von Daneker
4715520	4720080	talking about Eros and sort of the Metaxi binding the different finite and infinite.
4720880	4725600	You've got, you know, the Hansi-Frinach stuff and the whole complexity aspect of this really
4725600	4732000	kind of filling in this neo-Aristotelian leveled ontology, and connecting that to psychology
4732000	4737920	in the ways that this sort of complexification leads to increasing degrees of embrace, I guess,
4737920	4742640	is what Susan Cook-Groeter would call it, but the increasing levels of intimacy and connection
4742640	4748400	with other people, and that that becomes sort of the telos, you could say, that like whatever that
4748400	4755120	is is simultaneously the core of cores, but it's also that that emanating reality that's sort of
4755120	4760080	unfolding more and more of itself, and that somehow in the great, you know, paradoxical
4760080	4767120	vision of the mystics, the center is also their circumference, you know, and the origin is also
4767120	4774240	the destination. So that would be kind of a meta-modern mystical response to that question,
4774240	4779200	which I think begins more immediately from like a practical concern of like, how then, you know,
4779200	4784400	how then shall we live our lives? Sort of a thing. So the first answer I think is just sort of like,
4784400	4789680	well, you know, and this is the end of one of the great takeaways of that meta-modern film I
4789680	4796000	mentioned everywhere, everything everywhere at once, which is be kind. Be kind, especially when
4796000	4801520	you don't know what's going on, and we don't know what's going on, and we can expect that we should
4801520	4807920	always have our lenses ripped from our faces, and we see a whole new level of reality, and that our
4807920	4811920	senses of ego and worldview get deconstructed, and we've got to rebuild. There's always so
4811920	4815920	much that we don't know, and this profound uncertainty in the chaos that's beyond our
4816640	4821360	minimal complexity to be able to make sense of. So that's always going to be the case, but there's
4821360	4826720	always this enduring sense of be kind. And if you can start there, then you're probably doing
4827280	4832560	the most important thing. And then we can, you know, talk about whether any of the other stuff
4832560	4838720	makes any sense. Yeah, that's beautifully stated. That does remind me of what Aquinas argued that
4838720	4846560	Caritas was the highest virtue, that there was some superlative virtue up above all of them. And I
4846560	4854880	do think, at the end, you know, maybe this is kind of still kind of like an existentialist wager
4854880	4861600	here that I've always looked at that Brendan and gone, all right, what would be the worst,
4861600	4867520	and maybe this is some sort of like Pascal's wager sort of deal here, but what would be the
4867520	4873680	worst that would come of my life if I actually gave myself in love to seeking the good of the
4873680	4880560	other when I encounter them. And if I made that, and if I actually trusted that at the core of
4880560	4890720	cores, you know, that that was the thing that brought everything to be was a desire to connect,
4890720	4895680	it's a desire for communion. And at the very center of it was loving communion. I mean,
4895680	4900480	there's certainly, I'm not saying Christianity is the only story that has that, but I do look at
4900480	4904480	that and go, these are the sorts of things that for me, Brendan, I go, all right, I'm very aware
4904480	4911600	that I'm in a story. But this one, at least on those levels, it matches up for me, right? And
4911600	4920800	if at the end, I end up being wrong, I think I still don't think I would have as many regrets
4920880	4930320	as if I rejected that premise, I rejected the way of love, I rejected seeking the good of the
4930320	4937280	other. If I rejected that and pursued my own selfish ends, I think I've been bedside for people
4937280	4945520	who, pardon me, in those dying moments of life. And it bends bedside with people that have given
4945600	4955840	themselves to that. And if in the end, it's just all, you just head into the void. And that,
4956560	4962480	what was it in everything everywhere? Once the, the everything bagel of, yeah, everything bagel
4962480	4966640	of nothingness, if that just consumes us all in the end, I know there's a point in which,
4966640	4970320	you know, the possible argued, you know, if there is no resurrection, then, you know, we are to be
4970320	4974320	pitied among all people. And I'm pretty much an idiot for giving my life to this. But I still
4974320	4984640	think there's probably something of a Pascalian wager that not, not, not the way it's often
4984640	4991040	used in cliches, but the sense that what you're talking about, I don't know. But I know the
4991040	5001920	difference in my life when I've given myself to my ego versus giving myself to truly seeking the
5001920	5008080	good of my neighbor, those around me of loving God and loving other people. And then believing
5008080	5014240	that at the very core, of course, that there is, you know, Stanley Grence's book, Theology for
5014240	5018800	the Community of God, this is his argument that, you know, one of the distinctions for the Christian
5018800	5027200	story is the story of, at the very core of cores, you have a communion within a Godhead. And I'm
5027200	5032400	not asking, you know, you do agree with that or listeners to agree with that sentiment. But for
5032400	5037680	me, I find that picture compelling, that there is loving communion at the center in which we are
5037680	5043440	being enveloped into. If in the end, I'm wrong. I don't know. What's, what's the worst that come
5043440	5050640	with me, I suppose? Yeah, I mean, you know, yes, I, for me, the Kierkegaardian leap was really
5051440	5060960	a crucial transition moment in my life for getting out of nihilism, let's say. And I think that that
5060960	5066800	leap, you know, Kierkegaard had a stage model, right, of faith, basically, of the other religious
5066800	5070880	life. And it begins in aestheticism and, you know, goes into the ethical realm and into religious
5070880	5076880	religiosity. So he was using a stage model. And I think, I mean, I think that there's something
5076880	5081120	about what he's talking about that actually does fit into like a certain stage approach to
5082640	5087920	the religious life. I think for me, where it resonates most though, is it's what you do when
5087920	5093520	you're at the, in the bottom of the abyss of nihilism, that to me is where you make the Kierkegaardian
5093520	5100080	move. And one of the things that I find interesting about that, though, is part of what happens with
5100080	5104880	those stage transitions is that by the time they've sort of played themselves out and gotten,
5105680	5109440	they've sort of, there's like a seed there that then grows into something and the thing it grows
5109440	5114160	into is very different than the thing it was, if that makes any sense. And so I think that
5114800	5120240	while that leap of faith move is crucial, I think that at least in my experience, it was doing that
5121440	5127280	in that moment that then got me in a place where I could sort of climb out of the abyss
5127280	5133440	and then look back and be like, Oh, man, I used to be down in that abyss. Right. But I would never
5133440	5137360	have been able to do that had I not made that leap of faith. And so in that new leap of faith,
5137360	5143600	it was a, it was a genuine moment of, of actual nihilism, really, because, and this is another
5143600	5149040	interesting way in which, you know, logics in a kind of Hegelian way, negate their own negation
5149040	5152720	and then turn into different things, right? Because nihilism itself gets you to a point where you
5152720	5158880	can then affirm anything, including faith, you can become so meaningless in your life that you can
5158880	5163920	then just choose meaning. And it's fascinating that if you actually do that and play that out,
5163920	5167200	you can get out of that abyss, look down and be like, Oh, yeah, I used to believe in no meaning.
5167200	5172320	That's wild. But you got there because you, you made a ladder for yourself and you climbed on
5172320	5176000	top of yourself to get out. Or, you know, someone could say you were climbing on top of more than
5176000	5181200	that. So yeah, I guess the point I want to make is that I think that what you're describing is very
5181200	5186160	real and important. But I think I want to encourage people to that. I think that there's also something
5186160	5193040	beyond the leap of faith that it's like you're leaping. You do, you can, let's say, land somewhere
5193920	5197680	that might not be an eternal landing place, because again, in the sort of endlessly
5197680	5204640	shifting sands, right, that they do keep changing. But, but you do land somewhere and that the leap
5204640	5209760	in retrospect becomes something different from that vantage than what it was when it was initiated.
5210720	5213680	And so, yeah, I guess I wanted to make that point.
5215360	5219680	Yes, that's great. I'm glad you bring that up, Brendan, because there would be some confusion
5219680	5225200	there for some that might think, and maybe this is part of what we're processing in the Meta-Modern
5225200	5233520	Age is like, is the answer simply to go back, right, to go back like re-enchantment, is re-enchantment
5233520	5238960	simply going back? Do we just need to somehow get back to the medieval worldview and mindset?
5239520	5246720	No, there's a reason why we had to come out of that, right? And this isn't to fall for the trap
5246720	5253600	of the inevitability of progress. I'm not suggesting that, but there is even within,
5253600	5261360	for me, the Kierkegaardian model, and for me, within the Christian story, there has to be a
5261360	5269440	recognition of the perpetual transcendent nature of God. And so, you have these signposts and you
5269440	5275840	can't settle for the signpost unless they become the idol, right? So, you move beyond that, and
5275840	5282160	there's a constant moving beyond, but it's not a moving beyond that should lead you to feel like
5282160	5287200	I could never take a first step. And I think that's the thing I'm trying to work through and help
5287200	5296880	people work through is like the first step out of the pit, out of the abyss. And I think that's
5296880	5305440	where John has been really, really helpful. I haven't been... I'm going to word this carefully.
5306640	5316320	I have my disagreements with kind of Peterson's maybe post-daily wire kind of turn, but I think
5316880	5323040	Peterson's greatest strength was at least helping people go take the first step out of the abyss.
5324800	5332480	There's an abyss there. Make a movement. That is a kind of... That's Camus. That is kind of the
5332480	5338960	existentialist impulse, like radically rebel against the abyss in some way. Yeah. And I think,
5338960	5343840	I mean, this might be, hopefully, I've somewhat ingratiated myself, but here's where maybe I've
5343840	5351280	become very challenging as well, because part of me sees the process itself as destroying our idols,
5351280	5355440	which means sometimes... No, I'm not going to say sometimes. It means destroying various forms of
5355440	5362080	Christianity, maybe very, very precious forms, those earlier enculturated forms that we grew
5362080	5368240	up with that was our place where we had a firm foundation. For me, the spiritual life and spiritual
5368240	5376960	development is about being able to grapple with having your whole religious worldview crumble
5377600	5383520	and then get out of that abyss onto a new place, but then also accept that it's not like, okay,
5383520	5389680	now I'm safe. It's that if we really accept the eternally kind of self-transcending aspect of the
5389680	5397840	divine, then we have to take seriously that every solid ground is going to be liable for
5397840	5404160	deconstruction, basically. And I guess I'd want to invite people to see that process, not as an
5405360	5410560	inhibition towards growth or faith or any of that. It's just that's the faith journey. It's like,
5410560	5419840	you get closer to God, I think, by continually killing God, if I can be so violent about it.
5419840	5425200	But I mean, the whole death of God notion that Nietzsche presents us is, in a postmodern moment,
5425200	5430720	lands as this abyss of nihilism. But when you see that it's actually the recursive movement of the
5430720	5436960	killing of God, that actually is what teaches you that there is a God beyond God, there is a God
5436960	5442560	beyond every single idol that you set up. And I highly recommend the work of Jean-Luc Marion,
5442560	5449360	who is very helpful for me on this bit, of God without being, which again, puts us into a new
5449360	5454720	area of sort of apophatic mysticism. He draws a lot on pseudo-dionysius. But the whole notion is
5454720	5462560	that we have these conceptual idols, and that we need to really take seriously the idea that every
5462560	5467040	single notion, do I want to say that? I think so. I'll be absolutely autistic for a second.
5467680	5473840	Every single notion that we have of God is wrong, and that we should be okay with that,
5473840	5478880	that this is the upside of deconstruction. And I want to obviously qualify that with some of the
5478880	5482000	things I was saying about the core, of course, and you know that there's love. And so I'm not
5482000	5485200	trying to say that like we can all find out that God's is evil monster or something, right?
5485200	5491600	That's not my point. My point is that if we are using images and symbols and myths and stories
5491600	5500160	and worldviews as our story that we are affirming, great. But then we know that we're using the story
5500160	5507200	and then also be open to when the cracks show up in that story, that we can push that story over
5507200	5511680	and transcend to some new thing. And that's going to be a storyless moment for a while,
5511680	5516480	it's going to be falling through a vertiginous space of nihilism, potentially, or confusion,
5516480	5522320	disorientation. But that is part of the recursive process of reflection, and that in the process
5522320	5530080	we're getting closer to that emanating truth of reality, not farther away from it. So I would
5530080	5535760	throw that out there, and it's a very, it might seem, I don't know, bleak or something, and maybe
5535760	5542800	it is, but I mean, there's an element to which if we really take seriously the sublimity and the
5542800	5550000	grandeur of ultimate divinity, then we should be epistemically humble to see that pretty much
5550000	5557120	everything that we're using to kind of gesture towards that is the crudest of representations,
5557120	5560720	and ultimately they are representations, and therefore they're ultimately idols. So
5561680	5566800	there's a metamodern notion from, I'll just say the last thing, so Hansi Freinacht is a
5566800	5571760	metamodern thinker, he talks about the image of the headless God as sort of his icon for the
5572720	5577440	divine, because it's that God that can continually have his head chopped off, so to speak, that can
5577440	5585600	keep coming back, that is really what deserves our awe and reverence. So yeah, I hope people get
5585680	5592880	a sense of how what seems like the end of faith and religion and just this total
5592880	5598560	consummation of a nihilistic postmodernism can be worked through in a way that recursively
5598560	5604560	reaffirms itself to a point that you can see that there's a deep structure of meaning under all of
5604560	5611120	this. Yeah, I think maybe I'll throw out a couple, maybe different words, and maybe we're in agreement,
5611120	5615040	maybe we're in disagreement on that, and that's totally fine to be in disagreement on it as well.
5616400	5618640	You're saying there are different perspectives? What are you talking about?
5620800	5625360	I would maybe frame it as like our pictures are incomplete instead of all idolatrous.
5627120	5632560	I think for me would be at the core of idolatry is settling for the image as the final,
5634160	5640400	and so where it becomes idolatry is not in the announcement of it being true, good, or beautiful,
5640400	5646880	but in the finality of that particular picture, which is I do think at the core of the Hebrew
5646880	5653520	tradition, which is really fascinating, why the prohibition of making images of God is so fascinating
5653520	5657440	given the cultural context. Now you could say, well, they still made the Ark of the Covenant and
5657440	5663360	things like that, but still there were very, very strong prohibitions on trying to come up with a
5663360	5669280	particular idol that would represent God in the same way that you might see across other cultures,
5669280	5675680	and I think there's something to that, and yet I think my, I don't know if I'd say pushback,
5675680	5683600	or maybe it's a qualification or a point of seeing if we're on the same page in this or not,
5683600	5689600	is to say, okay, but I also don't want to do the move where I have to be the,
5692800	5698640	all of history begins afresh with me, and so I'm starting without any received
5698640	5703280	tradition, without any sense in which, yes, affirming the transcendence of God, but also
5703280	5710400	affirming the imminence of God. So God has wanted to make himself, at the nature of love,
5710400	5715200	would be some desire of intelligibility. To me, this grounds all of our scientific endeavors,
5715200	5719520	right, is that the world is, to some degree, another intelligible because it's given to
5719520	5725520	us as a gift. And with that, there are images that may still need to be corrected. But I think,
5726240	5729520	bring this up because I think I've, as a practical point, I know a lot of people
5730160	5738640	have personally found some sense of transformation and actually revisiting old practices from their
5738640	5745600	past that they maybe thought there was no value to. I think of even something simple
5745600	5751440	is the practice of someone revisiting an old song. So quick story, and I don't want to respect
5751520	5757200	your time too, Brendan, so we won't take too much longer here. But there was a guy at our church
5757200	5760240	who several weeks ago, maybe a couple months ago, came up to me and he's like,
5761040	5766080	you know, I really appreciate the songs that we sung together because they brought me back
5766080	5772400	to this moment. And he was a guy that was a Vietnam vet and he showed up at a Billy Graham
5772400	5777840	crusade one time just to, because the girl that he was interested in was going to the Billy Graham
5777840	5783360	crusade. And he spent the whole time at the Billy Graham crusade mocking it until finally the,
5783360	5787520	you know, the infamous Billy Graham altar call happened. And for some reason he tells the story,
5787520	5793120	he's like, I was making fun of the whole experience, the whole time, all it was there was just try to
5793120	5798720	get with this girl. At the very end, I found myself compelled for something beyond me to run to the
5798720	5804640	altar. And my entire life changed in that moment. And when I hear these songs, they bring me back
5804640	5812960	to that moment of transformation. I would be reluctant to say that the journey of perpetual
5812960	5819520	transformation would require that we have to disassemble all of those experiences down to the
5819520	5824080	studs. And I don't, it doesn't seem like that that'd be what you're saying is instead maybe
5824080	5830880	like maintaining a posture of epistemic humility to there being limitations to them.
5831680	5835360	Because otherwise, I think I don't know how we would get beyond the point of
5838960	5845440	there would, how do we, yeah, and then there's this dance here to get to a journey
5846560	5853760	requires a belief that there is someplace to go to. But it also requires the knowledge
5854480	5861360	that you have accumulated for how to use particular skills and resources to even make
5861360	5868720	a movement in a particular direction. And so I think that's the tension like I experienced
5868720	5873040	in this, because I do see a lot of people that, especially in our generation younger,
5873040	5878720	who might say, okay, I recognize that all of these stories and all these images of God are
5878800	5884400	always going to be broken. So one of my choices here is I will, I will never plug into any sort
5884400	5889120	of traditional religious community because everything that came from the past is ultimately
5889120	5893680	going to lead me. And what I often see just as a practical point is a lot of people get involved
5893680	5900160	into the kind of like DIY spiritualities in which they're continually functioning as like,
5900160	5904400	I'm the self author. And then we're kind of like back at that same sort of point of the
5904400	5909600	atomized individual who now most can come and then they get involved in some sort of weird
5909600	5916320	cult where you think the, you know, you think the sex scandals that go through churches are bad,
5916320	5923840	wait till you get involved in some of these like guru sex cults. So yeah, that's just kind of like
5923840	5929600	the back and forth I'm experiencing the tension about the images of God and the idolatry that
5929600	5934560	can come with them, but also recognizing like, I don't have to start from scratch. There's received
5934560	5940080	an inherited wisdom that we're actually referring to these people who we say they've got some glimpse
5940080	5945280	of it. And that gives us a vantage point to stand on and gives us some sort of, yeah,
5946240	5951440	gives us a house to live in as opposed to possibly feeling like we're always remodeling,
5951440	5955920	you know, all the time. Gosh, I mean, you know, this could be, I mean, there's, you just outlined
5956720	5960480	such important things. And I feel like this could be the beginning of a whole new conversation
5960480	5964720	or not a new one, but there's like, there's at least an hour and a half to talk about this. But
5964720	5973520	briefly, I mean, to tackle some of that. Yes, I get that. I think that
5973680	5986960	I probably do skew a bit towards the, how do I put it? I mean, yes, you're identifying something
5986960	5990560	in what I'm saying, which is true, which is this, you know, there's this recursive deconstruction
5990560	5995600	process. And when I think what you're saying is like, yeah, but like, we have to live somewhere
5995600	5999360	and like, can't we eventually kind of, you know, like be okay with where we're at and all that.
5999360	6003440	And I want to honor that beyond that, beyond that, Brandon, I'll just throw this one other
6003440	6008400	point is like, especially when we think about raising children, grandchildren, yeah, yeah,
6008400	6014640	then what do we pass on not just individually, but how do we help our kids enter into a story
6014640	6019280	that we actually think leads to their good and they're flourishing. Yeah. And I don't want to
6019280	6024960	see my kids go through like perpetual deconstruction. I don't like I want them to come face to face
6024960	6031600	with idols that are unhealthy, that are leading to disorder, to ruin in their lives and the lives
6031600	6037040	of other people. But I wouldn't, you know, the things that I've gone through, I wouldn't wish
6037040	6041760	on my children. Yeah, I know, but it's also like, you're a great guy. So like, maybe you had to go
6041760	6046160	through some of that, you know what I mean? Like, honestly, though, it's like, I've had this conversation
6046160	6050000	a number, well, broach this conversation a couple of times with people in terms of like,
6050000	6055360	this is this is partly the issue of suffering, right? I mean, you know, I, I, yeah, the idea
6055360	6064000	that experiencing your kids experiencing suffering is, is suffering. But at the same time, like,
6064880	6071040	puberty sucks, man, you know what I mean? And like, growing up is hard. And so there has got
6071040	6075200	to be some allowance for like, you know, but I think what you're also naming there was something
6075200	6081360	really important, which is that our, our whatever, let's say you use the word images, I guess,
6081360	6085120	because idols can be very loaded. And I do want to collapse a little bit some of this
6085120	6089440	hard distinction between idol and image, right? Because it's like, I think we should also be
6089440	6097040	okay with with the fact that we're not getting the absolute, right? We might be, we might be selling,
6097600	6103040	you know, it's like, we're, you know, the perfect shouldn't be the enemy of the good sort of a thing,
6103040	6107040	right? It doesn't mean that like, just because we can't continually bask before the eternal face
6107040	6111040	of God in the Imperium doesn't mean that like, we, you know, should just give up on the whole
6111040	6116320	religion thing. So, but what I was going to say was that I think you're naming a really important
6116320	6122160	dynamic, which is the notion of development, that what role development plays in all of this. And
6122160	6128320	by development, I mean, psychological development, I mean, the journey that we make from being an
6128320	6132960	infant to a young child to an adolescent to an adult and then to an mature adult, etc. Like,
6132960	6140320	that is an arc. And that faith is going to look different. Religion is going to look different.
6140320	6145120	Our God concepts are going to look different along that journey. And for this, I mean, you know,
6145120	6149440	James Fowler has done great work. There's excellent work on this topic that I think people should
6149440	6154480	be taking very seriously. And all this ties directly in actually to what I was talking earlier about
6154480	6159920	successively de centering and acknowledging perspectives, because it's the same mechanism
6159920	6164560	that allows our God concept to evolve and change and grow. So I want to name all that.
6165840	6169760	And I also want to name that different people are going to sort of, you know,
6169760	6174560	settle in a particular spot on their developmental journey in different places than others, right?
6174560	6179440	And, and not everyone's going to be called to a life of mysticism, you know, not everyone wants
6179440	6185120	to be a desert hermit, you know, whether or not desert hermitage is even, you know, an ideal is
6185120	6190320	a different topic. But like, let's just say the religion, religion has always appreciated the
6190320	6193920	fact that like, different people are on that journey and doing different aspects of it and
6193920	6198800	following it to different degrees. There's esoteric and esoteric elements to this and all that.
6199840	6204400	People have even challenged me like, is apophatic mysticism a legitimate basis for
6204400	6208720	religiosity? Like, how do you cohere a bunch of people around an absent center? I mean,
6208720	6215440	I think you make a compelling connection to the idea of, you know, an iconism in the Hebrew
6215440	6220480	tradition that literally did just that. So I think there are models for it. So I want to say all
6220480	6226960	that. I also want to say that, that I do think that there can be very healthy expressions of DIY
6226960	6231360	religion. And I have a whole way of thinking about this, which, you know, might, yeah, again,
6231360	6241280	goes into different terrains. But I see God as continuing to evolve. And that might be maybe a
6242240	6245680	kind of strange or even heretical idea to some folks. But if you really do take everything
6245680	6249680	that we've been saying seriously about this, you know, unfolding disclosure, you could even call
6249680	6255840	it unfolding revelation, then of course, our concept of God keeps changing and evolving. And
6255840	6260080	indeed, when you look back in history, you see that the notions of God do change and evolve,
6260080	6264080	and that they do move from, you know, more kind of mythological versions to more kind
6264080	6270240	of moral philosophical visions to transcendent and then into, you know, so, and interestingly,
6270240	6274800	those pair very, very fascinatingly with the kinds of developmental trajectories that we
6274800	6279440	see at the individual level too. So but again, different story. So what I'm saying is that it
6279440	6285600	might be very serious that some people feel like they are called to sort of push into new terrain
6285600	6291920	and in almost prophetic calling, try to speak new elements and new aspects of the divine into the
6291920	6298720	world. And that there are interesting and important ways that that kind of work can be done seriously
6298720	6305840	and not just sort of a new age DIY buffet style pick and choose approach, right? So I'm just hitting
6305840	6313040	a bunch of points here. But to get back to the main thing, I guess I just I do maybe because I've
6313040	6319520	gone through multiple deconstruction experiences tend to be okay with the hard
6320240	6329040	reality of owning and even valorizing, even sanctifying the inherent iconoclasm that goes
6329040	6338480	into a life of faith, because God is always calling you to, you know, break down those images. And
6339200	6346640	I've had to reimagine and re understand divine experiences in my life and things that have
6346640	6350560	happened. And, you know, these sorts of things that were very meaningful to me that set me on a
6350560	6356640	whole new path and gave me a whole new sense of my life, meaning and purpose and direction to have
6356640	6362720	those five years later be like, Oh, no, sorry, that that wasn't the thing, you know, and then
6362720	6367600	like to have that happen multiple times, right? It's sort of like, so I guess I'm just naming
6367680	6373040	all that. And I'm saying that, yes, not everyone needs to feel like that that the answer to all
6373040	6378400	this is somehow like to just give up on this on any notion of stability or anything like that.
6378400	6383600	But that there are ways of framing a lot of what I've said in social containers around development,
6383600	6388240	education, building developmentally informed approaches to teaching, you know,
6389360	6395200	catechism and faith and that's that really is appropriate to where people are at in life.
6395200	6400000	And to also I guess this is the maybe this is the point that I'm really getting at is
6400000	6406640	I think most people will be okay with that. People do I think eventually get not okay with
6407360	6415360	challenging received images, symbols, rituals, paradigms, stories, myths. And that's most of
6415360	6421040	what I've had to bump up against in my own deconstructions and in, you know, what's happening
6421040	6424960	with people around me and the people I care about and how I relate to them and all that. And I guess
6424960	6429840	I just always want to plug the idea that like, when people are deconstructing when they are going
6429840	6436640	through something radical in a worldview shift, like, there's a default assumption in religious
6436640	6443600	communities that this is a falling away. It's a it's a it's a regression. It's a, it's a, yeah,
6443600	6452000	the fallback. I forget there's kind of hostacy. Yeah, well, certainly. Yeah. Right. So there's
6452000	6457520	that's just, I think, I think we religious communities are misoriented around those
6457520	6462000	sorts of life events. And I think if we were to take them much more seriously and be able to
6463680	6470720	appreciate that they are the dynamic living moments in the evolution of faith, not just
6470720	6475840	for individuals, but for society and what can come out of those experiences, we would be better
6475840	6480080	off. And the last thing I'll say, because I'm rambling, is that I totally agree that we have
6480160	6485520	this rich tradition to draw from. And we shouldn't, you know, Gerta said he who can't draw on 2000
6485520	6489600	years of history is living from hand to mouth. So I'm not saying that like, oh, down with all the
6489600	6494480	idols of the past either. But we should also take seriously that part of what we now have available
6494480	6501760	to us is all the other religious traditions, right? You know, the Vedanta and neoplatonism and Zen,
6501760	6507440	and, you know, all these different traditions that again, I think people maybe are a bit uncomfortable
6507440	6511600	thinking about was like, well, yeah, we have tradition, but not those traditions, right?
6511600	6518480	And so, you know, I think that there is profound wisdom out there in a lot of different traditions
6518480	6524480	that we might want to consider folding that in as well. So yes, how do we, how do we navigate the
6524480	6529360	tension and the, and, you know, between moving beyond the limitations of the past, but not,
6529360	6533440	you know, throwing out the baby with the bathwater? That's a perennial issue. And how do we, how do
6533440	6540480	we find a sense of stability in a continually, you know, dynamic world upending potentially,
6540480	6545840	you know, situation of flux, perennial tension? But these are the questions that we should like
6545840	6550400	sort of be inviting the wrestling with, I think, as I've heard you talk about things and not just
6550400	6556800	sort of, you know, immediately precluding them from the religious life. Yeah. And I'm really
6556800	6561440	thankful for you sharing your perspective, Brendan, on this. And I'm glad, you know, even, you know,
6561440	6567520	as the opponent processing happens, that's where a lot of this growth takes place. If we are serious
6567520	6576720	about confessing our own limitations, our finitude, and even, you know, from a Christian,
6576720	6581040	you know, historically Christian perspective, we are confessing not just our finitude as an
6581040	6587520	inherent feature of being human, but some sense of like the depravity of our own condition to
6587520	6592800	sometimes bend things towards our own will to bend things towards our own selfish output.
6592800	6598720	Then we have to be open to having these sorts of dialogues where people aren't like necessarily
6598720	6603440	eye to eye, but there's a there's an openness to actually going, Hey, I think there's growth
6603440	6607120	happening. And I want to affirm that just I'm thankful for this dialogue, Brendan. And I'm
6607120	6611840	thankful, hopefully listeners experience it from wherever context they sit, they find themselves
6611840	6618480	situated in as a positive thing that produces growth in their life, and allows them to say,
6618480	6623520	Hey, let me take my lenses off for a second, try some others on. And without doing that,
6623520	6633200	I do think the sort of like naivete that leads to the kinds of stories that are used in oppressive,
6633200	6638800	abusive ways, ways that don't have adherence to reality. If we're not checking up against this
6638800	6644640	stuff, then we can we can be blindly participating in that. I just came to my head, maybe sometime,
6644640	6647680	I don't want to throw this out there and impose upon them. But I was just thinking, boy, this
6647680	6652640	really gets that I think it'd be really fun. And maybe I can invite them into it be fun to bring
6652640	6658560	like john vervecky on and someone else like Paul van der clay to talk about, like the merits of
6658560	6663920	kind of staying within a traditional religious tradition versus kind of like vervecky's project
6664000	6669200	and what it seems like is in keeping with some of your project is to say, all right, can we
6669200	6673920	take some of these and move them outside of the walls of traditional religious institutions?
6673920	6679920	Which methodologies are better? Are there pitfalls or things we can learn from both strategies? And
6679920	6685360	I think that might be fun if john and paul are listening, open invitation, and I don't know if
6685360	6688560	you'd be open to doing something with that. But I think it'd be an interesting dialogue. Of course,
6688560	6693600	I've been, I mean, that is the conversation with one of the major conversation that needs
6694240	6700560	conversations that needs to be had. I've started to get into elements of that with my own conversations
6700560	6707440	with with john vervecky. I'm actually, yeah, I have a open correspondence, meaning I reached out,
6707440	6712720	haven't heard back yet, from Paul van der clay. So we might, we were thinking of talking anyway,
6712720	6719440	but this would be a topic that I think would be perfect to to dive into. And so, yes, I'd
6719440	6724320	definitely be open to that. One last thing I want to say, too, though, is, is, is just that
6725200	6730400	the images that we use of great value that come from our traditions, also, we're always
6730400	6736960	deepening our understanding and our interpretations of them, right? I certainly, you know, a,
6737680	6743760	a minister of say 70 years old is going to have a very different conception of Jesus,
6743760	6748800	even then, you know, a five or seven year old, right? So like, and that we can take to take
6748800	6756480	those changes seriously. And yet, they still continue to persist and give that sort of continuity
6756480	6762880	and stability, even as there is evolving shifting notions. And then one of the challenges is how
6762880	6767360	do we, how do we make sure that we're in harmony when someone's using this word in this way or
6767360	6774960	this concept? And yet, this is a, again, a perennial issue in any religious context as people
6774960	6780800	continue to work with the ideas and deepen in their understanding of them. But that seems to be,
6780800	6785040	personally, for me, the hardest thing to do myself with some traditional material is,
6785040	6789600	is how to work with it from a new perspective or a new vantage that I can still affirm,
6789600	6794000	you know, are we ever in a position to be like, no, that's totally, we can't do anything with
6794000	6799040	that one, you know, or, or what have you, because it's, you know, people speak very eloquently
6799040	6804720	often, including yourself about drawing on this tradition and interpreting some of its ideas
6804720	6809760	in a way that I find, yes, you know, like I'm there with you, but then maybe enter a congregation
6809760	6814960	and you're expected to affirm a certain notion, theological notion or, or, or, you know, a creedle
6814960	6818720	or a dogmatic notion that's like, well, wait a second, that's not quite what I meant by
6818720	6824960	God or salvation or, or love even so. But yeah, so yeah, yeah.
6824960	6828240	You've nailed it. You've nailed it right there. I think deepening is a really good word. I think
6828240	6834080	that might be, that might be a word that you could find harmony between people within the
6834080	6839600	traditional religious communities still and those that might be kind of trying to work outside of
6839600	6846240	the bounds of that because deepening is I think a helpful picture that combats I think something
6846240	6851760	lots of traditionally religious people are, are suspicious of and I'm not saying it's accurate
6851760	6856000	and good for them to be suspicious, but I'm confessing even my own suspicion of the,
6856000	6860240	the kind of narrative that progress is any movement in any direction as long as we're
6860240	6866480	moving away from the past. Yeah, right. And so that, that notion seems to be not helpful in
6866480	6870880	many regards. So maybe there's a deepening and like you're saying, the deeper we get in some
6870880	6877760	subjects and some pictures, the more we realize, yeah, there might not be any goodness, truth,
6877760	6883920	or beauty in this image to hold on to anymore. And, but we only get that through these sorts
6883920	6888720	of dialogues, Brendan. And I think what the dynamic you just named also is, is to bring this back to
6888720	6892720	the meta modern conversation. I think that that's informing a lot of people's perspective in the
6892720	6898080	sense of it was a very modernist notion of, you know, anything moving ahead and away from the past
6898080	6903360	is good. And of course, you get that deconstructed. But I think people in a meta modern position are
6904320	6910080	certainly skeptical of that. They're skeptical of the skepticism of tradition as well. And so
6911040	6916560	I think you're seeing a lot of openness and interest in traditional forms of religiosity
6916560	6920960	for that reason. People don't feel like it has to be, again, that kind of false binary. So
6921920	6926720	yeah, this has been really wonderful. I really appreciate you having me on and getting to talk
6926720	6930720	about this stuff. It's been a pleasure. Thanks for your generosity with your time too, as well.
6930720	6934400	You know, before we recorded, you were asking how long this goes, hour to hour and a half,
6934400	6937760	but if we're really cooking close to two hours, I guess we must be really cooking because we're
6937760	6942400	close to two hours. So thanks. And I'm serious, I would love to maybe find some other time to
6942400	6947360	have continued dialogues, bring some other partners in that can can help enhance and expand
6947360	6950800	our framework here. This has been a blast, Brendan. Thank you so much. That sounds great. At the very
6950800	6954800	least, you're welcome on the Meta Modern Spirituality podcast, and we can continue this conversation.
6954880	6958480	But yeah, keep me posted. I'd be happy to talk with Paul and John for sure.
6959520	6967360	Great. Thank you, Brendan. Thank you, man.
