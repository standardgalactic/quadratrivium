00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Hey, everyone. Welcome to another episode of Deep Talks, Exploring Theology and Meaning Making.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,080
Today, I'm joined by Brendan Graham Dempsey, who I have to confess, for those of you that have gone

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,080
through my lecture series on Meta-modernism, I'm indebted to. I referenced Brendan's work quite

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,080
a bit. He's got a great series of YouTube videos out there, but not just YouTube videos. He's also

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,520
a writer and author, and he has written a seven-volume series called Meta-modern Spirituality

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,800
series, and most recently Meta-modernism, or the cultural logic of cultural logics.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,000
Brendan, I really do consider to be, maybe he wouldn't think of himself this way,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,520
but I will heap some praise on him. I consider Brendan to be one of the leading voices addressing

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,720
what's happening in our cultural moment right now with the Meta-modern shift. Many of you have

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,600
been really fascinated by this topic and subject matter, so I thought I want to bring on an expert.

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,600
I don't claim to be an expert, but I'm going to bring on an expert here to discuss

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,840
what's happening. Many of you are feeling like as you're engaging with storytelling and the arts,

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,760
and you're seeing these spiritual shifts happening, these religious shifts happening,

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,360
you're going, what is going on? Brendan is here today to help maybe try to put a name to some of

15
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,760
that, help us understand where we've come from, where he maybe predicts this is all headed.

16
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,600
Brendan, thanks for being here today. Thank you so much for having me. This is great.

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm excited. I've been watching your videos, really enjoyed the conversations you're having with

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,840
people like John Breveke and Paul Vander Clay. Yeah, just think you're putting out some excellent

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:44,080
content. Yeah, I'm excited to see what we dig into. Yeah. Okay, so for me, Brendan, I don't think I

20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:53,040
had a name for this right away, and it took me a while to give a name to what I felt I was picking

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,560
up on in particular in pop culture, noticing like aesthetic shifts, shifts in storytelling.

22
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,280
I have, I think, first found myself intrigued by what seems like a shift from Charles Taylor's

23
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,560
secular age into what I consider to be like a kind of a new epoch, where like on the bleeding

24
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,600
edge of it, what I've called the post secular age, we're also emerging out of the, what I think is

25
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,840
probably the death of the new atheist movement into this new era in the West. And then I started

26
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,360
noticing this shift in storytelling, aesthetics, the arts. And I found philosophers and people

27
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:42,080
like yourself describing this after postmodernism shift as metamodernism. When and where did you

28
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,480
first become aware that something was shifting in the philosophical landscape, the worldview

29
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,240
landscape, the religious, the cultural stories that we're telling? When did you first become aware of

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,760
it? And maybe what were some of the things that first tipped you off to, oh, something different

31
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,240
than postmodernism is happening here? Yeah. So for me personally, I would say I discovered

32
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,040
metamodernism, which is this term that people are talking about to give a name to some of these shifts.

33
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:19,760
I discovered that back in 2013. And to be honest, for me, it was in the context of really seeing

34
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:28,320
still a lot of very much kind of the postmodern zeitgeist all around me in the arts. I was raised

35
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,560
on very postmodern films and television and whatnot, as well as, you know, there's kind of an

36
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,320
interesting dance between that stuff coming in, but also I was raised in a very Christian family

37
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,800
growing up rather conservative Christian family. So those things kind of mixed in an interesting way.

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,160
But it was out of my sort of dissatisfaction and kind of a disaffectedness with a lot of

39
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,360
the contemporary zeitgeist that I went looking in the first place to see what people were talking

40
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,120
about that might be out there that was beginning to emerge. I mean, I was, you know, from a young age,

41
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,720
actually really interested in the films of, say, Wes Anderson and some other interesting

42
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,160
stuff that was starting to emerge that had a slightly different kind of vibe to it. But I

43
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,800
certainly didn't have any kind of a name or rubric to use. So it was around 2013 when I was

44
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,480
traveling, I was living in Europe at the time, and was trying to just make sense around the

45
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,240
aesthetic shifts that we would really now call postmodernism, like the shift that had become

46
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,280
just permeated society in terms of the aesthetic register that was operating with that so-called

47
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,920
cultural logic. And seeing, you know, is this where this ends? Is this where this all culminates?

48
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,800
Or is there something past the postmodern? And that's how I discovered the work of these Dutch

49
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,480
cultural theorists who are talking about metamodernism. And what's been partly fascinating about

50
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:08,160
tracking this is that it's been over the past, gosh, what, 10 years, right? That seeing what was

51
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,760
sort of initially kind of hinted at or beginning to be described at that point has really kind of

52
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,200
flowered and come to fruition in a big way in the last decade. So yeah, for me, it wasn't so much

53
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,280
looking around seeing big changes and then being like, what's this called? It's more like

54
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,880
getting intimations of some shifts and changes and myself being kind of an evidence of sort of like a

55
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,800
an exhaustedness with postmodernism and a looking beyond it and then finding this thing and then

56
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,760
seeing it really kind of, you know, increasingly accurately described the kinds of shifts

57
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,920
since then. So yeah, that was my experience with the term.

58
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,480
You mentioned already here, a couple of times, I think you just used the word exhaustion about

59
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:59,440
the way that the postmodern frame was impacting you. And I think as, you know, I'm 40,

60
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,800
much of my formative teenage years, like you growing up in a very conservative, evangelical

61
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,960
context, I was still engaging with the broader, I mean, we had our evangelical subculture with

62
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,200
all its DC talk and tooth and nail record bands and things like that. And I'm sure you probably

63
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,560
got into as well. Oh, yeah. But within that subculture, of course, we're plugged into a larger

64
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,800
culture, the culture, the the the the the meta culture over the over top of that. And of course,

65
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,960
much of what was going on in my formative heyday, where movies like Fight Club, even, you know,

66
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:43,440
in many ways, like Seinfeld was a shift away from modernist forms of comedy into something that was

67
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:51,120
self aware was, you know, I think Larry David famously had a line on the set that,

68
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,320
you know, we're going to make sure that there's no hugging, and nobody learns anything in each

69
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:03,760
episode, right? Which, which was such a like a critique, maybe a comedic sort of nihilism,

70
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:10,320
but a critique of the sitcom genre. So I very much can identify with that. But when you talk

71
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:17,600
about it, leaving you feeling exhausted, can you put your finger maybe on what was producing

72
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,840
that sense of exhaustion or dissatisfaction with that worldview, the worldview that was

73
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,400
supposed to be the critique really of all worldviews? Yeah, I mean, at the aesthetic level,

74
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,600
there's just a sense of, you know, it becomes a tired trick after a while, right? It's just

75
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,920
you've seen it so many times. And once you start to have some language for it, you're like, Oh,

76
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:43,360
yeah, there that is again. So that's largely what I mean by exhaustion, just the sense of like,

77
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:50,720
you know, Oh, this again. And by this, I mean things like, you know, you walk into an art gallery,

78
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,240
and there's like, I don't know, glitter and paint smeared on the ground. And then there's like a

79
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,560
little artist statement that's like, you know, untitled number 18, you know, and the little

80
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,600
artist statement says something like, this piece seeks to problematize our relationship with that

81
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,160
that that that. And, you know, when that stuff first starts to show up, you might be like, Oh,

82
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,080
this is kind of interesting, right? But like the opposite of interesting is boring. And so what I

83
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,640
think happened with a lot of postmodern art was it just reached this point of saturation in the

84
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:27,200
culture that it wasn't interesting anymore, which is sort of its claim to fame. And instead, I was

85
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,720
just increasingly boring. And so that's that's mostly what I mean by exhaustion. So there's

86
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:38,800
there's that though there is a worldview component to that as well. In the sense of to the degree

87
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,840
to which those sorts of aesthetic strategies are connected to the sort of broader, you know,

88
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,600
worldview of sort of the nihilism, cynicism, skepticism, right? There is a there is a point

89
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,960
in which that is itself kind of a tiredness. You know, a lot of the things that characterize the

90
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,880
postmodern period are its sense of an end. I think Jameson described that as right, everyone was

91
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,680
talking about the end of art and the end of this and the end of the end of the death of the author

92
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,560
and the end of history and everything was ending. And so everyone was sort of exhausted about

93
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,440
everything. It was sort of a cultural logic of exhaustion. And a lot of the kind of aesthetic

94
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,040
strategies I think reflected that. So you get exhausted by exhaustion. And that's a kind of

95
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,800
meta move, I suppose, that sort of starts to gesture towards, you know, what's beyond that,

96
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,600
what's what happens when you start becoming skeptical of skepticism in a bit cynical towards

97
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,160
the cynics, right? It's sort of inevitable that you're probably going to lead towards something a

98
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:46,480
bit more affirmational, positive, exuberant, idealistic, etc. So yeah. How do you understand,

99
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,440
and I've talked about this in my series, but I think it'd be helpful to hear another vantage

100
00:09:51,440 --> 00:10:00,640
point on this. How do you understand the shift from modernism into an appetite for that sort of

101
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:08,560
aesthetic art and storytelling? What do you think the primary factors were that led from that modern

102
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,200
shift to the postmodern shift to make it probably something at some point, which had some some value?

103
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,600
I know, I want to be clear, because there's a lot of conversation, particularly in the sorts of

104
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:28,480
internet spaces that might be adjacent to your work and our work, where there's a lot of kind

105
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,200
of postmodern boogeyman stuff out there, right, which is like this was the worst thing to have

106
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,520
ever come about. And it was all because of this weird cultural Marxism, whatever, whatever that

107
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:49,680
means. Was there any validity to the initial shift from modernism? What were the postmodern

108
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,760
storytellers, artists, and thinkers? What were they trying to grasp at? And do you see there

109
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,200
being any continuing value for any of what postmodernism was grasping at that you see?

110
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,720
This needs to continue. And in the metamodern shift, it seems to be continuing to be held

111
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,240
on to as something valuable. I think it's a great question. It's an essential question. And I feel

112
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,400
like you won't really get metamodernism if you don't get that that's an important thing to be

113
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:25,040
asking. So I think you're exactly right. There's a lot of easy boogeymanning and strawmanning of

114
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,080
postmodernism. And to be fair, these are big terms that are supposed to encapsulate a whole

115
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,000
bunch of different things, right? So a lot of the time, I think we're often just talking past each

116
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,200
other. And so we should be aware up front that like, these are big categories, they're fuzzy,

117
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:46,000
people will be using these terms slightly differently. But I think that, yeah, if as I'm

118
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,320
sure we'll get into in a minute, if metamodernism, which is what comes after postmodernism, is doing

119
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,400
so by means still of postmodernism, then we have to take seriously the notion that something from

120
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,200
this reaction carries forward. And as for what that is, there's so many angles you can take on

121
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,560
this. And I think they're all relevant, they're all valid. And I don't want to get too much into

122
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,120
the weeds or too much over people's heads and try to deal with too much here. But I'll just name a

123
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:25,920
few components of it, right? There's at least, let's say, a historical cultural moment, which I

124
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,600
think really pushes us in this direction. And it largely comes after the World War II.

125
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,080
So let's step back a little bit, right? You know, the modern, of course, is in itself

126
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,800
kind of responding to the traditional worldview and a religious worldview. And a lot of what had come

127
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,280
as sort of the emergence of modernity and modernism, it was about sort of trying to

128
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,200
you could call this sort of the modern project, right? Like create something after the dissolution

129
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,560
and the rejection of maybe more traditional religious narratives, right? So you get new kinds

130
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,240
of grand narratives about reality, that it's about progress, that there's this evolutionary

131
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,680
direction that's sort of leaning cultures towards new heights. You see this and then this glorification

132
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,720
of technology gets wrapped up with this. So the modern is about the new and the novel and the

133
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,120
technological utopia that we're sort of all gloriously heading towards and, you know, and sort

134
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,960
of providing a new grand narrative of history that is not the sort of kind of classic Christian

135
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,480
narrative that had been, you know, the one to prevail throughout the entire, you know, medieval

136
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,840
period, essentially. Now it's a different narrative and it's rooted in this world and all those things

137
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,760
I just said. And I think that once you see what happens with World War II and how it just sort

138
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,160
of just cuts the legs out from under that, I think that's really important for understanding

139
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,720
the rise of postmodernism. Because a number of things happen there. Basically, this, this utopian

140
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:06,480
aspirational dream vision of history, you know, doesn't lead to utopia, it leads to the gulag

141
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:13,360
and to, you know, to Auschwitz, essentially. And so, you know, and technology starts being very

142
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,800
much clearly seen for the ways that it destroys, as well as creates the way that it alienates,

143
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,400
as well as, you know, brings people together. And so, yeah, really just the whole period from

144
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:30,880
World War I to World War II, which is really sort of a big colossal one war with sort of,

145
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,800
you know, interim period. Half time. Yeah, basically. And it's just this utter destruction

146
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:43,040
of the old world. And I think that that creates a sense of disenchantment with the entire

147
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:51,280
modern project and forces people to reevaluate, you know, the ideals of liberalism and enlightenment

148
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,960
values and supposedly this emancipatory project that modernity was, it seemed to lead to this

149
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:02,480
iron cage. So you get after World War II, people who are critical of these sorts of things,

150
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,360
critical of the ideals and all that. And yeah, that leads to an attitude of skepticism. It leads

151
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,800
to an attitude of cynicism, right? It's sort of like, oh, whose big narrative are you pushing at

152
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,280
me today, right? You know, it's like, we've been here before. There's this, yeah, there's this

153
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,160
profound distrust or, you know, hermeneutics of suspicion, right? So it makes sense that people

154
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,480
like Freud and Nietzsche and Marx come in to try to, you know, but even, of course, and this is

155
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,600
where part of this issue around like the cultural Marxism bit becomes really problematic is that

156
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,200
like, even Marx had a grand narrative, right? So what's so interesting about this postmodern

157
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,800
moment is like, no, even the Marxists are out the window because they're pushing some story.

158
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,280
And so, you know, once you've eschewed, great progress to exactly. Yeah, it's just, you know,

159
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:58,720
right, it's taking that Hegelian dialectic and moving it into a materialist frame.

160
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,920
Yeah. And certainly, a lot of those ideas had a direct link to what you see happen in World

161
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,880
War II. And then, of course, the aftermath of the Cold War. So you get, I think, a profound

162
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,240
disenchantment, disillusionment with this whole way of looking at the world. And there's a kind

163
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,280
of self-protective element that goes with that as well. It's sort of like, all right, I won't

164
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,840
believe anything, you know? And so nihilism, of course, is sort of a natural product of that.

165
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,480
So anyway, there's a, there's kind of cultural historical moment that sort of makes sense for

166
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:33,200
why those ideas would start to be on the rise. There's also, you know, technological things

167
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:39,600
that happen. There's, you could say, sort of evolutionary complexification, developmental

168
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,520
angles that can be brought to this narrative. I could go on and on. So there's really a whole

169
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,920
set of things that kind of explain why all of a sudden you start seeing this emergence of these

170
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,640
ideas. But maybe more importantly, though, to get to the heart of your question, which is like,

171
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:01,360
what sort of carries forward from that, that is a value? And I will say this, that like,

172
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,600
a big thing that these critiques did was they forced us to be more sort of,

173
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,640
you know, demanding of what we took as true, right? It's sort of like, you know, there's this,

174
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,320
there's this critique of authority and this, these appeals to, you know, oh, well, this is the story,

175
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:25,440
this is the narrative, or this is the, you know, the political, you know, message or what have you.

176
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,040
There is sort of this sort of standing back and being like, well, no, we're not going to just,

177
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,200
you know, buy whatever bill of goods you're selling, we're going to really interrogate them,

178
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,280
ideally, right? And so one of the positive things that does come from that is a critique of certain

179
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,840
modern presumptions that had been taken for granted, which are now start to be sort of

180
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:51,040
exploded, right? Because once you start asking, well, for who is this story, you know, serving or

181
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:58,560
what, you know, to whose benefit does this particular message work, then you're starting to

182
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,960
become more aware of, you know, the exclusionary dynamics that go into selling stories and

183
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,040
grand narratives and sort of like who's being left out, who's being oppressed, who's being

184
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,840
used and exploited. So these issues become very salient to postmodern critiques of,

185
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,640
of things. And basically, in the absence of this is the true story of history,

186
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,120
all you've kind of got then is critiques of power and privilege to be able to fill in that gap.

187
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,720
And so some of that, some of that is legitimately very valuable. I mean, we need to be doing asking

188
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,320
those kinds of questions. And I think that the things like the civil rights movement movements

189
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:47,680
that come in the 60s, you know, are a big product of, you know, those cultural forces

190
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:55,040
shifting really much of the kind of cultural and sexual liberation and revolution kind of

191
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:01,120
is a product of some of these, you know, presumed axioms of sort of modern thought being sort of

192
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,880
exploded and having new opportunities to be critiqued and whatnot. So anyway, I could say a

193
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,240
lot more about that. But I guess I would just say that I think we should be asking more about

194
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,960
systems, right? What are the contexts that we're operating in? Let's see the things that we

195
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,960
were using to make sense of reality and examine those, right? So there's this moving back and

196
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,400
stepping back from the ideologies or the frameworks that you're using to make sense of reality and

197
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,720
interrogating those. And all of that I find to be very useful. And so when you start getting into

198
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,360
metamodernism, there's certain aspects in which we can't just throw that stuff out, we shouldn't.

199
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,880
There's profound insights to be gained from appreciating that we are in social contexts,

200
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,680
that humans do a lot to construct those contexts, and that we shouldn't just take a sort of natural

201
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,440
givens, things that we are enculturated into, and we should interrogate them. And that really

202
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,680
starts to set you up into a new place where you're able to see cultural objects as, you know,

203
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,320
objects of analysis and not just things that you see the world through. And then that can really,

204
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,400
you know, start to put you in a position where you're, where you have a cultural logic of cultural

205
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,000
logics, which is kind of what the book is about. The core of cores, right? I don't know if you

206
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:25,760
saw this or have seen this trend on YouTube and TikTok called core core. No, I haven't.

207
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,680
Okay, so this is really fascinating. And I think this has connection to the aesthetic

208
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,040
interests of metamodernism. So side tangent here, and I want to come back to some of the

209
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,400
stuff you said about postmodernism and connect it here too. But the core core movement is this,

210
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:51,280
again, like a really a vibe, as my kids would say, it's a it's a aesthetic vibe that gets at

211
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,480
so you might have genres on TikTok and YouTube, like YouTube reels, for example, or YouTube shorts

212
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,320
of these different cores, you know, I'm going to butcher some of the other ones like

213
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:13,200
home core or these different cores. And so the core core, yes, exactly, right. And of course,

214
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,760
in music, you've had hardcore music, metal core, you know, what's at the core. And so core core

215
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,720
is trying to get at like, what is at the core of cores. And these are really fascinating vignettes

216
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,880
into I think, like the psyche of Gen Z right now, which tends to, from my vantage point,

217
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,080
address the meeting crisis differently than millennials and Gen Xers did, many of much

218
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:42,880
of which I think has been marked by a sort of like comedic nihilism, where Gen Z is much more.

219
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,040
This is when I saw I noticed a shift happening, Brendan, it was probably my last few years of

220
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,920
teaching in a classroom. The biggest thing I started to notice was how differently Gen Z

221
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,480
was engaging the subject of September 11th from old millennials like me.

222
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,840
When I noticed that they were comfortable, not only comfortable, but like they loved sharing

223
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,720
like 9 11 memes, you know, and getting humor out of them. It was like a strange form of gallows

224
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,840
humor. Yeah, you know, whereas that would be almost like a sacred untouchable subject to

225
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,440
millennials and Gen Xers in particular, like that was so devastating. And I noticed boys in

226
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,200
particular, 17, 18 years old, like passed along 9 11 memes, which I like found offensive, but it

227
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,280
was kind of their way of processing the the anguish of living in this particular moment.

228
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:41,520
But core core, these videos are often set to like, just a really, they seem to be not coherent

229
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:48,080
scenes spliced together. But there's a general aesthetic or vibe of melancholy,

230
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,960
very, very depressing underneath that. And you might see spliced together scenes from kind of

231
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:02,640
these like, sigma male, anti hero figures that you see in like the literally me videos out there,

232
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,320
like a Patrick Bateman and scenes from those sorts of movies. But it's set to it's fascinating

233
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,520
because you're talking about the cultural logics of cultural logic, like what's at the core of

234
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:22,000
cores. And to me, I see that connecting to what seems to be happening for those of us who post

235
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,080
modernism maybe was our native tongue. And so all we knew was primarily irony, cynicism, I mean,

236
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,840
this at a folk level, as you mentioned already, postmodernism is far too complex, but folk

237
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:40,000
postmodernism, you know, the fight club postmodernism, the maybe the Rick and Morty postmodernism,

238
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:49,760
the that that genre, seeing at the end of that people feeling that they have, in some sense,

239
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:57,200
taken the sledgehammer of deconstruction to their overarching stories to their guiding stories,

240
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,840
deconstruct them all for many people. And, you know, I don't know much of your personal story,

241
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:08,080
but I'm sure there are, there's a sense in which we can both identify with the disillusionment

242
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:16,160
that many people are age experienced with traditional religion, and feeling as if there has

243
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:24,640
been a use of those stories to continue to victimize people. And when you combine that

244
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,160
postmodern critique, that overarching stories, mask a play for power to continue to oppress

245
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:37,200
and victimize, and then you've actually seen firsthand improper moral immoral behavior,

246
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,240
you've seen scandals, it seems to only strengthen that case. But I think, from my vantage point,

247
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,760
that that exhaustion that we feel at the end of that still leads us to this deep desire to

248
00:24:49,760 --> 00:25:01,280
actually live in some sort of story. How is the metamodern shift attempting to address that desire,

249
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:09,040
that exhaustion, and that need to live in some sort of story that provides positive reconstruction,

250
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:17,200
that provides you a way of actually speaking sincerely, without throwing out all of what

251
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:24,320
have been really valid critiques of postmodernism. How does it use the language and aesthetic of

252
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:31,040
postmodernism to attempt to inhabit a meaningful story, to say things that are true, good and

253
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,920
beautiful once again? How do you see that working from your vantage point? Yeah, well, I think that

254
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:44,560
what you're naming is like a really significant dynamic of metamodern thought. And I think once

255
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:50,320
you see that that kind of thing is going on, that I think is sort of the answer to the question,

256
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,680
but it's sort of like it happens in different ways. So if broadly speaking, this postmodern

257
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:01,680
move is to deconstruct and to subject to interrogation and hermeneutics of suspicion,

258
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:08,720
and it can do that in multiple ways, including, well, we'll leave it there. So that's one thing

259
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,840
that it's doing, but it does differently. I think the metamodern move is sort of an attempt to say,

260
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:19,920
okay, yes, okay, now what? Let's reconstruct and let's try to, as you say, maybe live in a story

261
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,960
while owning it's a story or what have you, and recognizing that that happens in different ways.

262
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:34,080
So one way that I see that happening is in, well, okay, so there are different instances.

263
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,120
I'll use one as an example. One is everything everywhere all at once, which is a kind of

264
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,640
explicitly metamodern work of art. The directors, Daniel's said as much, they're like, yep,

265
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,440
we're aiming for like a metamodern thing here. And if you watch the movie, it's all about meaning,

266
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:56,240
it's about nihilism. It's about how do we make sense and purpose of our lives in the context of

267
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:04,000
this infinite multiverse in which anything could be anything. And one sort of the kernel of the

268
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,400
response there comes at the end of the movie, which is something like, nothing matters, be given

269
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:17,360
that. Therefore, everything can matter. And some people might find that rather unsatisfying. I

270
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,760
wouldn't entirely blame them if they did so. But that is one thing that you see. And there are

271
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,200
elements actually speaking of Rick and Morty in which that shows up. It's sort of like, hey, no

272
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,320
one's supposed to be here on purpose. There's no plan, just come and sit and hang out with your

273
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,520
family sort of a thing, right? So there's this move towards what you see also at the end of

274
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,800
everything everywhere at all at once, which is like, I, the main character chooses to be

275
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,840
with this particular family at this particular laundromat in this vast galaxy of universes,

276
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,880
because you know, this is her world essentially. So there's a, I think a move towards sort of

277
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,920
reaffirming the value of sort of local meaning making and sort of recognizing that things could

278
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,200
be an infinite number of other ways, that there's no sort of foundational ground. And yet we can

279
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,240
affirm the value of our lived context. You could say we can choose the story and then put a lot of

280
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:15,440
weight onto that story. Very existentialist move. It is, it is, it's, it's a, I think there, it even

281
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,840
goes a bit further than the existentialist to the degree that I don't know, I get the impression

282
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,280
from a lot of existentialist thought that there's a sense that there's still something inherently

283
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,560
of value in making meaning that somehow like the meaning making thing is the thing. But in this,

284
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,360
it's sort of like, nope, even that is just sort of, you know, you can deconstruct that, but we

285
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,520
still need to do these things. So there's an element to that. I see that narrative crop up in

286
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:46,000
Meta modern spaces. I see kind of similarly this sort of approach around owning the social

287
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,320
constructiveness of things, but again, sort of affirming that, well, this is the condition

288
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,800
of all knowledge. So this is just kind of how all knowledge works. And so, you know,

289
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,480
I grew up in this story and you grew up in this story. I think I've seen you mentioned some of

290
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,640
these kinds of frameworks here in some stuff you've said. And there's some recognition that

291
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,560
that's how things work and then just sort of owning and accepting it and then kind of living

292
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:17,920
into that story. That's another approach. I'm very interested in trying to find sort of

293
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,720
places where meaning actually does have some kind of a, how would I put this?

294
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,480
It kind of grounds out in some significant way still. So it's not just to choose your own

295
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,240
adventure. It's like, Oh, no, like this is this is kind of how this works, even though it admits

296
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,080
of a lot of variability. So like, for example, very kind of simplistically, if you want to say

297
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,880
that like older forms of meaning where like meaning just has objective existence, it just is,

298
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,360
right, like things mean, maybe that has a very kind of naive, traditional religious kind of

299
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,920
flavor to it. And then sort of modernity comes around and it's sort of like, well, wait a second,

300
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,400
we look for meaning in the world and we don't find it there. Therefore, meaning isn't objective,

301
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:05,040
it's actually just purely subjective, right? Which is an idea that I think postmodernism

302
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,240
takes even further in some of the ways that we're talking about, just like, yeah, we all just live

303
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,240
on our own story. There's a third answer to that, which is that meaning actually is real,

304
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,960
but it's neither purely objective or subjective. It arises in this sort of dynamic,

305
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,120
transjective relationship between, you know, in entity and its environment.

306
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,480
Yeah, more about that, Brendan, because I find that fascinating because part of my

307
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,240
vantage point on this would be to say that, you know, part of the modern shift was

308
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:41,520
critiquing traditional metaphysics. And then as we move further away in the

309
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,280
epistemological problem of how do I know anything at all, metaphysics seems to play less and less

310
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:53,600
of a role in philosophy and practically in people's lives where it's like, we can ground this in

311
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:00,320
phenomenology or other places. But whether that's sort of an agnosticism about metaphysical claims

312
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,240
where it's like, how could we ever know any of this at all to a more postmodern distrust of

313
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,080
metaphysical claims? So help me understand a little bit more when you're saying like,

314
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,440
you're not satisfied from your vantage point, you're not satisfied with a sort of like

315
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,920
Sisyphusian approach to just say, all right, I got to push this boulder up the mountain once again,

316
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:28,560
but I can choose to make it valuable by just simply deciding in this internal state that

317
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,120
gods can't control my internal state. So therefore I can decide that this is valuable.

318
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,120
Are you saying you don't, you're not satisfied with that? And you'd like,

319
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:45,840
you feel there needs to be some other grounding beyond the self? And are you saying there's a

320
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,680
search for that? Do you feel like both for you individually, but also within maybe the broader

321
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,480
metamodern shift, are people kind of going back to metaphysics for that? Are they turning,

322
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,920
what are they turning to to find that, that maybe that grounding outside of the self?

323
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:07,120
Yeah, yeah. No, and this I think is, this is the thing that so many people are grappling with

324
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:17,840
right now in a million different ways, right? And so, all right, yeah. So the danger as I see it

325
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,760
would be that we do just sort of like become aware of all these dynamics around the modern

326
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,760
turn and the postmodern turn and then say, ah, but we still need stories or something like that.

327
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,360
And then just sort of kind of, we don't carry the ideas forward. We kind of just then conclude

328
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,520
we have to sort of fall back on something, you know, more kind of existentially primitive to how

329
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:45,360
we were, you know, enculturated or something like that, right? So I find that unsatisfactory.

330
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:54,560
I also find sort of other approaches that do something very similar to be missing something

331
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,360
really crucial. And so I guess I'll just say the way I look at it, and this is informed by folks,

332
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,880
I just mentioned, like John Vervakey, and, you know, there's some great conversations between John

333
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,440
and Greg Enriquez, who has a wonderful sort of meta theory, unifying theory of knowledge.

334
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,080
People like Bobby Azarian, who are all operating in this metamodern space, I think that it there's a

335
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,640
shared solution space to these sorts of issues. And this is how I see it. It's something like

336
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:33,200
there's an entity in a context and in order for it to continue to exist, certain conditions need

337
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:40,640
to be met, you could say. And those are real, right? Like, I can't, I mean, unless you want to be

338
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,160
totally solipsistic or skeptical to some extreme degree and just deny the existence of, I don't

339
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,680
know, anything, any kind of world or something, right? You'd have to admit that like, yeah, no

340
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,800
one even the most ardent sort of relativistic postmodernist anti-realist is going to step outside

341
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:00,960
while it's raining and just say, it's not raining, you know what I mean? Like that doesn't fly.

342
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,840
So if it is raining, then you have to consider the fact of like, okay, well, this is going to make

343
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,880
me cold and miserable and, you know, probably I might get a cold or whatever. So you have to like

344
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:18,640
do things in relationship to reality in order to continue to successfully be an entity in the

345
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,360
world, right? So you're talking like emergence and emanation in some sense, right? Yeah, well,

346
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,920
certainly there's an emergent component to this and the emergence emanation bit, maybe I can come

347
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:34,240
back to that and see if we could plug it into that kind of a framework. But the basic idea that I

348
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,840
find really helpful can actually ground out in some things like as fundamentals like information

349
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:46,960
theory, thermodynamics, where you've got, okay, I am an informational entity in order to continue to

350
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,400
exist successfully, I need to be processing information about my environment. And I need to

351
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,920
do that accurately. And if that information actually is helping me maintain my viability,

352
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,800
then that information is meaningful to me, like full stop, like that's just, you know,

353
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,360
someone can't be like, I'm just going to go walk off a cliff, you know, and deny that that it's

354
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:13,600
like, nope, you won't be around anymore, right? So the knowledge of if I walk off this cliff,

355
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:19,760
I will no longer be around, that's meaningful. And at a certain point, you just can't kind of

356
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,560
deconstruct that anymore, you can't kind of, you know, interpretively, hermeneutically work your

357
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,840
way around, but it could mean this or it could mean that, right? Like, there's a to the degree that

358
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:35,840
information about the environment affects the viability of the continued persistence of a

359
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,840
thermodynamic entity in context. That's now, you know, now, what becomes really interesting

360
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,960
about that, though, is that that's a very crude, simplistic notion of meaning. I mean, you know,

361
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,880
the kinds of meaning that we really mean when we talk about meaning or things about like, what's

362
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,040
the meaning of my life and relationships and all this stuff, right? So there's, you've got to get

363
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,280
from this sort of very simplistic notion of meaning that you get from thermodynamics and

364
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,240
information theory, to the kinds of existential, philosophical, spiritual, religious meanings

365
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,880
that we're talking about. And so then you have to appreciate that there's a complexification

366
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,160
process between the two. And, and that's where things really start to get interesting when you

367
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:20,880
can situate yourself as the long end product of billions of years of complexification, where

368
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,440
information and entities sort of have been in this continual dance, leading to increasing

369
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,120
information, increasing complexity of organisms, increasing complexity of the relationship between

370
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,840
the two, so that meaning itself evolves and complexifies. And that's kind of the stuff I'm

371
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,000
exploring at the moment, which again, dovetails very much with a certain kind of strand of meta

372
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,200
modern thought. But it's, to ground this all back, this is, this is the same, we're trying to resolve

373
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,440
the same issue here, right? Which is like, how do we make meaning in this world that we supposedly

374
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,240
have come to realize is fully deconstructible and totally constructed and whatnot.

375
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,840
And are we simply making it or are we discovering it? I think that's an important question too,

376
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:04,480
right? Yeah, I think that a lot of what is coming out of the meta modern discourse space is

377
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,640
taking these seeming binaries and then realizing the way that it's not either or,

378
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,600
that there's always sort of this both and component to this. And so I think that once you have that

379
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:23,040
in mind, you can look back and see how a lot of our going astray on a lot of these issues has come

380
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,240
about because we absolutized a particular way of thinking about something, right? So like,

381
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,680
you go back and, and it's like, oh, something is true. And that's just, it's just true from the

382
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,920
beginning of time, it has a priori, you know, reality to it. And, you know, there's some

383
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,400
Platonic ideal that exists in this other world, right? And it's like, and then over time, that

384
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,240
all gets sort of critiqued and deconstructed. And then you get the sort of Kantian thing of like,

385
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,280
ah, no, it's just the mind, right? And the and reality conforms to the mind. And then you get

386
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,400
this radical relativism and the sort of like, total, you know, the potential for total social

387
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,560
constructivism, it's just sort of whatever the mind thinks is real. And both of these are very

388
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,080
extreme positions, right? It's sort of like, well, maybe both of these are going on simultaneously,

389
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,320
like maybe there are real things, but the mind needs to construct its ability to be able to

390
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,200
understand and relate to them. And, you know, there are frameworks for thinking in these terms,

391
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,720
like Piaget's constructivism, and the whole tradition of developmental psychology is like

392
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,800
this continual equilibration between entity and field coming to learn each other more and

393
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,960
more so that it's both there's a reality and the mind constructs or participates in constructing

394
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,880
its relationship to that reality. Both of those are true. We don't have to choose between them.

395
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,040
So I think a lot of the meta modern conversation is like really trying to find those points of

396
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,000
synthesis, which is often a synthesis between modern and postmodern extremes.

397
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,840
I see what you're talking about here, Brendan, is also having a point of connection to what

398
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:57,600
maybe both modernism and postmodernism were doing, especially in American culture with the

399
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:03,760
elevation of the atomized individual, right? So if in modernism, the individual, well, you know,

400
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,160
we could take this all the way back to the Protestant Reformation, where Luther trusts

401
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,880
his gut over and against the hierarchical institutions of the past, which were the place

402
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,320
in which you did have access to the truth. That was the narrative, right? So the rejection of

403
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,200
locating it through the hierarchical institutions and in the individual gets us, obviously, to

404
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:32,720
Descartes. But then the postmodern impulse has been to not only critique, you know, we're not

405
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,800
just doing like Descartes, I think, therefore I am, but there's also the sense in which because

406
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,720
all narratives are a play for power that maybe, especially as this takes shape in American culture,

407
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,320
that I can author my own narrative. I can radically self-author in a way that

408
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:58,400
there is no necessarily external reality to which I have to conform to. The only thing I'm trying

409
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:04,320
to conform to and maybe even conform the world outside of me to actually match what I believe

410
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,280
my internal state is. Yeah, yeah. No, and you see this all the time with the way that language has

411
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,600
become so important. We have to police language now because there's this thought that, you know,

412
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,520
oh, well, if we just change the words, we'll change reality. Like if someone doesn't have a

413
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,400
word for something and we just obliterate that from our conceptions, then this will lead in, you

414
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:29,920
know, some miraculously better world. And so there is very much like that kind of, you know,

415
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,680
the way that we are tone policing and word policing and cancelling each other and sort of

416
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,280
not engaging with these ideas and sort of just cutting off conversation at that level is a direct

417
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,760
outgrowth of a certain worldview which says that we create reality. And so if we can change people's

418
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,320
minds, then we'll change reality. And so obviously that is misguided and not entirely true, right?

419
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,400
But there's a kernel of truth to it. Like we can change the way we speak about things and maybe

420
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:04,960
that would have a moderately better impact on society. So again, it's just this escape from

421
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,800
either or thinking of like we have to choose one side of this polarity when in fact what I can,

422
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,480
I see is very emblematic of all metamodern thought as sort of this continual moving between

423
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,840
these different polarities. And this is a sense of what the word meta means actually, meta can

424
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:27,840
mean between. And one of the ways that the original Dutch theorists use the term related directly

425
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,240
to that is that the metamodern mind is always oscillating is the word that they use between

426
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:39,200
sort of these postmodern views of things and these modern views of things. And for the record too,

427
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,280
I think also it's important for the context of this conversation, not just the modern. I mean,

428
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,400
like, let's say other cultural logics, it's oscillating between on the one hand, it can kind of

429
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,720
take that social constructivist angle. But then, you know, when that starts getting too extreme and

430
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,880
just sort of ridiculous in terms of where it falls apart with reality, then it can kind of

431
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,080
reaffirm that, well, no, there is something here, right? But there's this back and forth that's

432
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,640
sort of continually setting those different lenses in relationship to each other so that

433
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,280
you're getting some dynamic third thing rather than just, you know, one of these two extremes.

434
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,080
So I think, yeah, you see that, you see that in all areas of sort of, you know, this metamodern shift.

435
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,720
Do you think maybe I'm just kind of spitballing here at the top of my head as we're talking,

436
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:31,040
do you think there's any possibility that maybe what we have learned is, as we look at the kind

437
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:37,840
of Hegelian, here's the synthesis, here's the antithesis, and we've seen as we've gone back that

438
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:44,560
how strongly people have said the antithesis is the truth, you know, up against the synthesis that

439
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,520
maybe what metamodernism is trying to do is trying to like predict in advance where the

440
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:57,280
new synthesis is going to land, maybe by doing that oscillation between the thesis and the

441
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:04,000
antithesis. In this case, it would be the primary thesis and antithesis of modernism and

442
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,920
postmodernism, right? So modernism, and maybe even going before that, the traditional storytelling,

443
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,400
traditional worldview, that you have that sort of thesis, postmodernism being the antithesis

444
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,240
and metamodernism, obviously seeking to find that the synthesis in advance, instead of just

445
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,640
letting this collision maybe devolve into a total state of war and anarchy and complete

446
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,080
disillusionment, do you think there's any merit to that possibility?

447
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:41,040
Yeah, I mean, I think it's a very helpful way of thinking about it, that it's becoming aware of

448
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:47,600
the dialectical nature of this is at least the crucial part, right? If you are only able to

449
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:54,640
conceive of opposite binaries, you're in a different position. If you're able to cognize, oh,

450
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:00,320
I'm between a rock and hard place, I'm between two opposite poles, and they might actually

451
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,040
relate to one another, and they might actually maybe even sort of complement each other or have a

452
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:13,200
opponent processing factor that maybe, and once you're in that mindset, I think you've already

453
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,920
made that move, and I think you're right. I mean, there's an anticipation factor of like, okay, well,

454
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,240
then what does it look like to sort of bring together these seemingly opposite things?

455
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,400
So anyway, that's a very helpful framing. There are all sorts of ways of framing it,

456
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:33,360
and I don't want to reify any particular one as though this is the right metamodern, because

457
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,320
there's these dynamics that are very deep, and we can represent them in different ways.

458
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:45,280
Modern or thesis into this, a synthesis is one way of doing that, but we can also do more traditional

459
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,840
Hegelian dialectics. We can talk about basically things going meta on themselves, or I talk about

460
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:58,320
eternal recursion, the sort of continual standing back and self-reflecting on what was before,

461
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:05,520
but I think what they all gesture to is that it's aware of the fact that we are presented with

462
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:12,560
these contraries and building that into the perspective itself, that like perspectives

463
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:18,800
are often mediating what came before in terms of seeming opposites, and they need to ideally

464
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,920
bring these together and find where they can productively relate to one another.

465
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:28,320
Okay, can we circle back around, because when you're talking about I think the desire to

466
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,720
find meaning outside of the self in something, I don't want to go as far as to say objective

467
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:44,560
truth, but to ground it in a, let's say using other philosophical language, the recognition that

468
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:50,000
I am not necessary, but I am contingent, and I'm dependent on some other necessary necessity

469
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:56,880
beyond myself. I think that is part of the awareness that there are forces at play,

470
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,360
and this is where for me I wanted to circle back around to what you're talking about, because it

471
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:06,720
seems like this dance that Viveki has been talking about for quite some time between

472
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:13,920
emergence and emanation, so emanation being kind of like the top down, the thing outside of ourselves

473
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:22,480
that provides the constraints, the playground, if you will, for which we can conform and have

474
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,000
that bottom-up causality, but the bottom-up causality isn't that, and I think this is really,

475
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,160
I know this is going to sound for some of my listeners like we're getting too far into the

476
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:38,240
philosophical weeds here, but I do think there are practical existential daily life stuff connected

477
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:45,200
to this, that if we see ourselves as having nothing outside of ourselves to conform to,

478
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:51,200
like there's no reality, there's no playground, there's no fence to inhabit, there's no space,

479
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:59,680
there's no container to be poured into that it creates what again like Viveki has called

480
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:05,040
combinatorial explosion, which is part of our problem, like we feel like we can, I don't know

481
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:11,280
if you follow any of like, what's his name, Byung Chul Han, any of his work at all,

482
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:20,080
golly, I'm drawing a blank on his book titles, but he's talked about this shift into

483
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:25,280
an achievement society, an achievement society in which we feel the constant need

484
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:31,040
to optimize ourselves, but the problem is that we have endless, seemingly endless options for

485
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:35,760
optimization. So there aren't constraints. And we feel like as part of our narrative,

486
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:41,680
we can make ourselves whatever we want, but we don't know what good thing to make ourselves to.

487
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:49,760
So there's like a, there is the recognition of some sort of top down constraint, top down

488
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:58,720
thing to adhere to. Is that a fair way of maybe assessing what some of what the metamodern impulse

489
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:05,840
is to find some proper container while still recognizing the critiques of postmodernism that

490
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:11,920
I recognize and I tell this to people, Brendan, like I'm a pastor, I recognize that if I was born

491
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:19,280
in Somalia, I would the statistical likelihood of me being a Christian pastor is infinitesimally

492
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:25,840
small. I recognize I was born into the story. I'm self aware of the story, but I am also trying to

493
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:33,760
be honest about, okay, given that I can't live without a story, I have to adhere to some structure

494
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:40,000
and I'm earnestly searching to allow myself to adhere to some structure that I see is true.

495
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,920
I'm not trying to be blind to it. It seems like what I've noticed in our generation is like the

496
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:54,320
tiredness, the exhaustion of nothing but cynicism, nothing but irony, irony that isn't like leading

497
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:59,440
to sincerity. And we have this new impulse that goes, all right, I'm still going to use my ironic

498
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:07,440
language, but I am trying to find a container, like I'm trying to find the top down force that I

499
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:14,240
should adhere to. Right. Yeah. So, okay, this will get a little trippy maybe and maybe a little weird.

500
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:18,880
Let's do it. Let's get trippy. So I remember this episode of Boy Meets World where-

501
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,360
Let's go there. Well, one of my favorites. Yeah, yeah, speaking of, yeah. And all right,

502
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,760
so in this episode, it's the older brother. I want to say his name is Will, but maybe that's

503
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:34,480
the name of the actor. I forget the name of the older brother. Eric? Eric, yes, Eric. Cory's older

504
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:42,240
brother goes off to Hollywood because he's gotten into acting and while he's there, he stars in a

505
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:51,760
television sitcom pilot called Kid Gets Acquainted with the Universe. And on the set, it's all the

506
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,600
same characters from Boy Meets World, but they're like, they have slightly different names and

507
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,000
he's playing a character, you know, named Derek or something, right? So it's this, it's, and sorry,

508
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,920
so this is what you would call going meta, okay? And on some way, right? Now, when you watch this,

509
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,360
you're like, this is a spoof. It's a joke. It's sort of like a, there's no way to,

510
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:14,240
they're being cheekily self-aware, right? And they're breaking the fourth wall and all this stuff.

511
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,960
And all these things have characteristic elements of postmodern art. You see this a lot in postmodern

512
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:25,200
art of just being very hyper self-conscious, where the, where a book becomes about reading the book,

513
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,120
right? That sort of a thing or like, you know, the author is telling you that he's writing the

514
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:33,440
current sentence that he's writing, right? These are all meta moves that you find in kind of classic,

515
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,880
postmodern works of art. And a lot of the kind of immediate takeaway from some of that stuff,

516
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,960
right, is, oh, okay, yeah, all this stuff is kind of just silly. And it makes me very aware of this

517
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,200
thing. It's sort of, I don't even have the illusion of like, you know, suspension of disbelief. I'm

518
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,000
just like, it's putting it all in my face. It's a construct. It's not real, all that. And that can be

519
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,320
sort of disenchanting and disillusioning and sort of, yeah, then you're kind of being ironic, okay?

520
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:05,120
But now here's where I want to kind of get a little trippy with this. Then you kind of really

521
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:10,640
go with it. And then you work with that move, because you do see it is a move. Like that's

522
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:18,720
what postmodern art is doing all the time in all sorts of things. The Simpsons have other

523
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,280
television shows on that like dinosaurs or family guy that they have send ups of because they're

524
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,480
like, hey, wow, these guys are so much like us, right? It's sort of like, okay, we're going to do

525
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:32,720
this meta move, right? So this is a move. But once you see that it's a move, you have a new

526
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:39,600
enduring container, right? You have a new thing that exists. And so then you can say, oh, well,

527
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:46,240
what is the nature of that container? Well, it's this recursive move that has a deep kind of

528
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,640
structure to it. And it repeats itself and it reflects on itself. Now, once you have that,

529
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:56,560
you're like, this is a real thing, right? I'm not just like, we've deconstructed something,

530
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:02,240
but we've deconstructed it using a thing that is not deconstructed. You know, it's a real

531
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:08,800
mental move that you make that that is, it's the container for deconstruction. You see what I'm

532
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,680
saying? So it's like, you've gotten beyond deconstruction, meta deconstruction, because

533
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:18,240
you're actually seeing the very container that deconstruction needs to even be able to do what

534
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:23,200
it's doing. And once you're there, you can start to say, Hey, there are things that exist outside

535
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:28,480
the context of just infinite, you know, sort of cultural constructivist deconstruction, there are

536
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:34,720
the containers in which these things happen. And that provides a new kind of solid ground to work

537
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,440
with. But you have to go through it to get there, you have to deconstruct in order to get outside

538
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:45,280
of the container. So what I posit is that this postmodern moment is very much where we're still

539
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:51,280
stuck in the deconstructing move, we haven't kept going, we haven't gotten beyond it. And so we're

540
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,760
stuck with the disenchantment and the disillusionment and the cynicism and the irony. But if you keep

541
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:03,440
going, then that is that very stuff is what allows you to find a new kind of meta level container.

542
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:08,320
So that would be a way of beginning to think about the sorts of moves that go into

543
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:13,520
these sorts of things. And I can say more about meaning as sort of a, you know, a similar move,

544
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:20,160
but that would just be one way of framing it. Okay, so then, if Meta Modernism is trying to find

545
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:29,360
the container that holds the deconstruction, yeah, is that a fair way of summarizing that?

546
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:36,880
I mean, as I say, right, all Meta Modernisms or the Meta Modern quintessentially is about going

547
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,320
beyond postmodernism by means of postmodernism. So whatever you're going to find on the other

548
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:48,560
side is going to be somehow a meaningful product of postmodernism, but it's going to also transcend

549
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:54,080
it as well. And so this is a classic example of how that would work, because you have to go

550
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:58,560
through the deconstruction process to then find the new stable structure. I wouldn't go so far

551
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:04,480
as to say that all forms of Meta Modernism are somehow about trying to do this. I think that

552
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,360
this is a, this is, this is, and I do, I mean, this is the case I'm making in my book because

553
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:14,880
to talk about a cultural logic of cultural logics is kind of where you get on, you know, get to on

554
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,400
the other side of this stuff is that you see that, oh, there's a structure to how cultural

555
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:26,480
logics themselves evolve, right? So Meta Modernism is also about this move in the sense that it's

556
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,840
aware of how this process unfolds. So it's able to see that, oh, postmodernism is actually a

557
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:37,440
necessary step in this process because it's, it's key to how this whole thing operates. But then

558
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,560
you're able to contextualize that and you're able to relativize relativism, you know, you're able

559
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:46,880
to be skeptical of skepticism and you're able to deconstruct deconstruction because you put it in a

560
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:52,640
wider frame. So that to me seems to be like a really necessary, you know, way of thinking about

561
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,600
all this. And when I synthesized all the different ways people were talking about Meta Modernism,

562
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:02,080
that is sort of the underlying structure to all these different kinds of discourse seems to be

563
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:09,120
this basic move. So that, that is the, the basic idea. And I think what I would say though,

564
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:18,400
so I want to tie this into the meaning issue, which I think would be valuable, but I also

565
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,200
recognize that there's a lot, there's a lot to all this. So I don't know if we want to,

566
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:27,440
you know, get a little bit sure first. Yeah, no, no, I'd like to talk about that. The only

567
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,680
other pressing question I have, Brennan, you can pick which one you'd like to address first is

568
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:38,240
thinking about what sorts of implications that this getting at the core of cores, the container

569
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:48,480
of containers, what, what this, what this shift, this impulse, what kind of impact it has on like

570
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:59,440
traditional religion in America. Because I've wondered how much of the, the shift towards

571
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:06,240
little autobiographical, and then you can choose which way you want to take this, you know, so I

572
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:12,800
think back to my parents, my parents who were, my dad was raised kind of nominally Catholic,

573
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:18,480
my mom was raised devoutly Catholic. They saw that in some sense as the thesis

574
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:24,400
with all of the flaws that they perceived in that thesis. And then when they got into their

575
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:30,480
early adult years, they, they chose this kind of new thing at the time, which was this born-again

576
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,600
Billy Graham evangelical experience, very personal. So we're going to move away from,

577
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,280
you know, at the time there already shifts happening because it's post Vatican II from

578
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:44,400
Latin mass, but they want to hear the Bible in their native tongue. And they want to read

579
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,000
Bible translations that sound like their cultural context and the music that's going to happen in

580
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,800
church isn't organs. And from the medieval times, there's not doing the smells and bells, we're

581
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:02,640
not doing that stuff. We actually want to communicate with the cultural vocabulary of our day. And so

582
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:08,880
they very much grew up in that. I'm a product of that, but I see a lot of people that their parents

583
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:15,680
went through that sort of change. And then they grow up and then they go to like Eastern Orthodoxy

584
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:24,560
or Catholicism or, you know, the more high church liturgical expressions. There's a lot of

585
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:30,000
different ways we could frame that, but I'm really wondering how much of that, you know,

586
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,240
is that simply kind of, you can kind of see these recurring patterns throughout time of people going,

587
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,720
Hey, you know, I came from this and I want to go back to something before that.

588
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:49,760
Is that metamodern? What what sorts of impacts do you see as these stories disseminate in through

589
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:55,280
popular culture as the aesthetic changes and those aesthetic changes begin to impact, not just

590
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:00,080
guys like you and me who are reading this stuff and not to pat ourselves on the back, but we're

591
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:05,760
not normal when it comes to when it comes to like picking up on these trends. I would like to think

592
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:11,200
that I'll speak of you that you're very much on the front end of this, this, this bleeding edge and

593
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,000
this, I don't think if you asked your average person on the streets, like what metamodernism is,

594
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:23,120
they'd be like, yeah, I have no, I have no idea. So as that moves more into the mainstream and moves

595
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:28,080
into broader culture, what sorts of impacts do you see it having on traditional religion? And,

596
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:32,720
you know, feel free if you feel like that connects to what you want to say about the pursuit of

597
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:37,840
meaning. Sure, there is something there. Yeah. No, I'll tackle that one. And it's so interesting

598
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,520
too, because you described that whole thing you described, I have a direct experience with that

599
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:48,000
as well. You know, my, my previous, well, my family, my parents basically had that experience,

600
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,320
grew up in, you know, mainline churches, found the evangelical thing, because it was the antithesis

601
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:57,760
to the thesis. And I was that next generation that was very fascinated by Eastern Orthodox

602
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:04,720
Christianity. I mean, one thing I'll say is, you know, they say that every

603
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:11,040
problem looks like a nail to a hammer, right? So I'm a metamodernist thinker. So there's a danger

604
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:15,600
of trying to interpret all these sorts of patterns and culture as somehow, you know, whatever. And

605
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:19,440
I don't want to, I don't want to. Hammer away. Hammer away, Brendan. This is what I called you

606
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:26,720
here for. But so, yeah, I want to avoid the trap of, you know, of doing that. I will say, though,

607
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:34,480
there's an interesting way, right, about how, like the attraction, say, to Eastern Orthodoxy

608
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:39,600
after coming from an evangelical context is different than if you made the reverse move.

609
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:45,040
Do you see what I'm saying? It's because, right, like, I do think that there's this metamodern

610
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:51,120
aspect here in which there's a deep pragmatism as well that I think informs a lot of metamodern

611
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:55,520
thought, which stems from the same insight, right, of like, well, we got to live with some story,

612
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,600
right? You know, so it's sort of like a pragmatic realization that you're

613
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,440
are between a rock and a hard place, and you just got to choose because you got to get on with your

614
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,400
life and you have to have some meaning in it. So there is a pragmatism there. And I think that

615
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:14,960
there is a kind of attraction to certain kinds of religiosity from the standpoint of, damn it,

616
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:21,440
I want to be religious, you know, and I, it's almost like, you know, I don't want to say it's

617
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:27,120
as flippant as, you know, flip a coin, literally, but there's some sense of like, I need this element

618
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:31,920
in my life, and I want to choose this, and I'm attracted to these aesthetics, right? And so I

619
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,480
will engage with this thing as it gives me this value. But that's a very reflective stance to,

620
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,880
like, adopt a religious tradition for. It's very different if you were to grow up in the

621
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:46,080
tradition itself and just like, get the experience of this is the truth, and this is the way that

622
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:50,240
reality is, you'd have to deconstruct that before you'd even be able to get in the position where

623
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:57,200
you could authentically, agentially, volitionally choose the thing that you're in. And oftentimes,

624
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,440
to be fair, a lot of the places that we're coming from, we're often trying so hard to distance

625
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,600
ourselves from that it's going to be very unlikely that we're going to end back in the place once

626
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:10,400
we've done all that work that we have done so much to get away from, though some people do.

627
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:17,360
And I could very well conceive of, you know, a situation where people leave, or let's say that

628
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:26,000
people find a form of the religiosity that I left and affirm it from a metamodern standpoint for

629
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,360
all the reasons that we're talking about. But you have to see, and the point I'm making is that

630
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:33,680
they're different then, right? That it's different. And a lot of it has to do with the degree of

631
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:39,440
reflection, which is, again, the sort of recursive reflection and this reflective move that we're

632
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,040
always doing with things. It's sort of we're learning from them. We're able to take them as

633
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:47,360
an objective analysis. We're able to, you know, not just look through our glasses, but look at

634
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:53,520
our glasses and then go from that vantage, right? So I think a lot of, you know, the move here is

635
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,720
when you grow up, when you're enculturated, and when you're learning things, like your whole

636
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,760
formative period of life for the first, say, 20 years, a lot of it is just being taught how to

637
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:11,440
see through a certain pair of glasses, right? And then in time, you might very well come to

638
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:16,240
realize that that way of seeing isn't complete, that it is a pair of glasses that you can take

639
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:20,720
off and analyze. And then you do that for a while. And maybe that occupies a lot of your, you know,

640
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,800
I don't know, early 20s and whatever. But then eventually you're like, okay, yep, that's how

641
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:28,880
this whole thing works. And, you know, you know, now it's like, which pair of glasses am I going

642
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:33,840
to wear? And why? That's right. You can't go without that lens. There's always the interpretive lens.

643
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:38,240
So the awareness of that to me seems like a differentiating factor between just like,

644
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:43,600
I'm leaving this thing because I'm upset or I'm hurt for valid reasons or non valid reasons,

645
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:48,240
whatever the case may be. And I'm running away from this thing. That seems very different than

646
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:54,720
going, Oh, I've taken off my glasses, I realize I have an interpretive lens. And then you go and

647
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,160
you take that one set off, and then you put on another pair. And then you realize, Oh, shoot.

648
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:05,120
Wait, this is also has these filters. Yes. Right. Yes. Now, this is where things start

649
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,400
to become very interesting as well, though, because all right, a couple things here, let's say I have

650
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,800
some rose colored glasses on, right? And I'm like, Oh, yes, the world is so rosy. Now, of course,

651
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:17,440
I wouldn't say that because everything is rosy. So it's all contextually viewed through that lens,

652
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,800
right? But then someone comes around and they tell me, Hey, actually, you're just viewing through a

653
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,400
pair of rose colored glasses. And to the degree that I don't just immediately shoot them away,

654
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,920
because they're challenging my sense of reality and get very defensive about that and actually

655
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,000
take it seriously. Then I might go through the whole thing of like learning to take them off,

656
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,040
look at them, find another pair over here. And this has a green lens and then try those on,

657
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:41,920
right? And I think that I guess one of the things I want to say is one, that movement I think is

658
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:49,600
the movement from sort of naive traditionalism or naive religiosity into a sort of modern critical

659
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:56,480
stance where we're able to take religion itself as a subject as an object of criticism and study.

660
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:02,640
And so that would be starting to do this, right? And then the postmoderns come along and they're

661
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:08,000
like, Oh, okay, yeah. But here's all these other glasses you could choose from. And so

662
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:14,320
so it's all relative, right? It's all totally random, right? Now, here's where the thing really

663
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:18,320
starts to click, I think, is that then once you take that serious, you're like, Wow, there are

664
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:24,000
all these different kinds of glasses I could be wearing. And then you say, I can put them all

665
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,520
on and I can compare them, I can put them all on and adjudicate between them. Some of them are

666
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:35,040
showing aspects better than others, maybe, maybe some prescriptions closer to my eyes or whatever.

667
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:39,360
There are certain aspects in which I'm getting new elements of what is there through different

668
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:45,440
kinds of glasses. But even bigger than that, one becomes aware of this whole meta move that it's

669
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:50,000
the case that we're all wearing glasses, we can all become aware of it, we can all take them off,

670
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,800
study them, and then see the ways in which we're wearing various forms of glasses. And that that

671
01:04:54,800 --> 01:05:01,120
then becomes, you could say, a new set of glasses that seems like it's absolute that you're now

672
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:05,120
you're looking through the world through the lens of lenses, right? You're you've got a cultural

673
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:09,360
logic of cultural logics because that's what that's what this is. It's sort of like, what are these

674
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:14,720
different lenses? Well, they're different religions, they're different ideologies. But more than that,

675
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:21,920
they're different sort of degrees of of of perspectival awareness, you could even say.

676
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:27,200
And so you start to see that what all of these things have in common is that it's better to

677
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,280
have more knowledge of more glasses and to be able to go through the process itself of adjudicating

678
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:40,480
that. And that there's something that feels closer to like truth about that whole meta process,

679
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:46,960
right? And so you're able to allow you to have some sort of comparison. If you say,

680
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:54,640
as I've tried on 12 different sets of glasses, I notice some similar features shared,

681
01:05:54,640 --> 01:06:02,400
maybe that's pointing to some, you know, core of cores here that that actually is revealing

682
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,920
something that is true across these perspectives, right? There's there's not only the fact that

683
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,760
you can then compare perspectives and see what they have in common and then be in a better position

684
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:15,360
to say, you know, well, that's real. And I think to some degree, modernism has already kind of

685
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:20,080
engaged in projects like that. But I think what's even the bigger move is seeing that there's this

686
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:26,720
meta pattern of lens analysis, you know what I mean? That that that that the whole thing itself

687
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:34,800
provides a way to adjudicate between perspectives. And because, right, when you put on a pair of

688
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:41,040
glasses, and you can't see that people are wearing glasses, those glasses aren't telling you as much

689
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:46,240
about reality as a pair of glasses where you put them on and you do see that, right? This is where

690
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,200
the analogy falls apart a little bit because glasses can't do all this. But you understand what I'm

691
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:53,200
saying, right? That there's something intrinsically valuable about the art of deconstructing a

692
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:59,680
worldview in a perspective in order to then see beyond it. And then to get to the meta perspective

693
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:06,800
of seeing the process of worldview construction and deconstruction itself, which then provides you

694
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:12,160
some some solid thing that you can compare all worlds to, if that makes sense. So that gives you

695
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:17,920
this meta pattern that's sort of a new rubric or a new measure or universal scale or something,

696
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:23,200
right? And this is what I mean when I talk about meaning and the complexification of meaning and

697
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:28,880
all this stuff, because this is this is something quite different than, you know, oh, we all just

698
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:32,960
live in a story, so we might as well choose one, which is still very inflected by postmodern

699
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,760
relativism to, well, we've gone through postmodern relativism, and now we're able to

700
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:42,560
relativize it within a broader process that is sort of a still actually universal process.

701
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:49,280
Now, hopefully, one, people are with me on any of this, and it's making sense to

702
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:56,320
I want to qualify that as well, because I don't immediately once you see that this is this process,

703
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,600
you see that it keeps going, right? There's no clear end to this process. It has a kind of

704
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:07,840
self-transcending quality to it. And so there should be some epistemic humility that we have

705
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:11,440
here, that even though we have this sort of universal scale, like, well, how many perspectives

706
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:16,080
can we can we see and that that's real and that that's not just, oh, you know, whatever you want to

707
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:22,560
believe. We also shouldn't say that even this whole perspective won't be transcended in some

708
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:27,280
other meta, meta level where we put on a new set of glasses. And I can understand how that might

709
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:32,080
make people uncomfortable, because it seems like the solid ground that we just got from this sort

710
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,760
of thing is now immediately then torn out from under us. But I also want to invite people to

711
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:42,240
think about this as a mystery, as the mystery of reality that I think personally I see as a sacred

712
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:47,360
process. And when I start marrying this idea of how the development of knowledge works and the

713
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:54,160
connection with reality to certain forms of apophatic mysticism, there's fascinating connections

714
01:08:54,160 --> 01:09:00,000
there to be made in terms of like an eternally disclosing world, a reality that is becoming more

715
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,400
and more clearly known by people, even as it's also always receding away in this ultimate mystery,

716
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:11,920
which I think is, you know, if you're a believing person, shouldn't be any great discomfort either.

717
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,400
There's just, there is sort of this. And so this is, this is what I want to tie back into

718
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:21,200
the emanation bit, you know, so what I'm talking about is emergence. Every time you take off the

719
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:25,680
glass and come to this whole new conception of reality, you've like gone through an emergent

720
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:29,680
phase shift, and you're seeing things in like a totally different way, things have new, your

721
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:34,000
knowledge has been restructured and reorganized, and you've got a new, you know, that's emergence,

722
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,680
that's bottom up kind of self transcendence. But there is this thing that sort of on the other

723
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:44,800
end of this whole process that we're moving towards in doing that. And that's the emanation

724
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:49,040
bit. And that's a lot harder to speak about, right? And that's where I want to locate that

725
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:54,960
emanation aspect. And you can call that God, you can use, you know, the imagery of the Bible to

726
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:01,600
talk about it. And you can, and I think I think we should draw on the experience of the mystics and

727
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:05,600
the mystical literature, especially in the Christian tradition to think about this.

728
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:12,640
But I think that that's, that's the, that's the mystery of it to me. And I think we're,

729
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:19,280
where this stops being a purely sort of cultural analysis, or kind of epistemological speculation

730
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,800
and starts to become a kind of devotional relationship to the ground of being in the

731
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:30,000
infinitely self emanating abundance of the fullness of the one or something like that.

732
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:38,080
Yeah. So with that mystery, there's maybe a couple of different existential responses

733
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:44,800
to that, to the confession of the ultimate transcendence of the ground of being, right,

734
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:50,880
that there is in the Eastern Orthodox tradition, you're more apt to use the apophatic language

735
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:56,160
of what God is not, than what he is, so that you don't constrain the possibilities of the

736
01:10:56,160 --> 01:11:01,760
transcendent. And yet, there's a real problem there with combinatorial explosion, with decision

737
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:06,640
fatigue and a sense of decision paralysis, where you can get to the point where the mystery becomes

738
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:11,840
so grand, you don't know where to take a first step. And I think that's, that would be a concerning

739
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:17,520
feature of, okay, so the metamodernism, metamodern shift, if you accept some of these

740
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:27,600
presuppositions, if you accept where, what's the word I'm looking for, if you accept where the,

741
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:33,280
because it's not even just, I don't want to reduce this to like, here are, here are propositional,

742
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:37,600
here's propositional knowledge about the world, you know, because it's very much connected to,

743
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,680
when you watch these core core videos, for example, it's not propositional, it's aesthetic,

744
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:49,760
it's a vibe. So where's the vibe? Where's the vibe leading you? I'm very optimistic about the

745
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:56,960
possibility that in this moment, people are very open to positive reconstruction. That for me is

746
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:03,280
like a win. But I'm also confessing my conviction of location on this as somewhat of a Kierkegaardian

747
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:07,920
Christian, and that I'm like, yes, there is something, there's something at the edge of this

748
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:14,640
doc, you know, and this is maybe to use another metaphor or picture that we can, let's say, take

749
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:22,960
the reasons for believing that there is something positive to reconstruct into, that there is a

750
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,800
core of cores, that there's a container of containers. No, I think I know where you're

751
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,240
getting at. So, well, I don't want to interrupt you, though, so please finish your thought. But I

752
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:34,400
think, okay, so let me just throw this out there then to you, Brendan, then you can please provide

753
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:39,120
your feedback and comments on it. But for me, the way I picture it is this sense that

754
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:46,960
there is enough general revelation to use my Christian theological language to lead me to,

755
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,840
as like what Paul would argue in Romans one, that God's invisible attributes are

756
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,960
your on display within the material world that's been created. And there's enough reason to believe

757
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,760
that there is a core of cores, there's a container of containers, there is, and you could go through

758
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:08,640
all the Aristotelian, you know, the five reasons of Augustine or not Augustine of Aquinas, for

759
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,880
an Aristotle, for believing in all of that stuff. But it still leads you to this point

760
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:20,560
of which irrationality is not enough that you have to enter into the suprarational. And this,

761
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:28,720
for me, is again kind of a Kierkegaard disciple. This is where that leap of faith from the edge

762
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:34,000
of the dock into the ocean that stands in front of you is the only way that you can know whether

763
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,600
or not you will swim is when you actually move from here, the propositions that I've been built

764
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,880
upon. And now I have to actually like give of myself. And so for like Kierkegaard, this is the

765
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:52,320
only way that one actually truly comes to know Christ, to know God is in that decisive leap

766
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:58,000
of faith, the actual movement. So I think you're probably tracking with me on this, Brendan. The

767
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,440
question then for some that come out of this, they go, I want to reconstruct, I want to positively

768
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:10,160
reconstruct. Where do I take the leap? Is there a leap? You know, with that leap also comes the

769
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:15,600
risk, I don't want to leap into the wrong thing. You know, I still have to hold to the what we've

770
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:21,920
learned from postmodernism that maybe that story I'm leaping into is just simply masking a play

771
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,320
for power. I think the one for me, Brendan, I have no problem talking about this. This is me

772
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:31,440
confessing that I know I'm situated in a story is like, you know, the Nietzschean critique that

773
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:37,200
this is nothing more than slave morality. It's a it's a poignant critique, you know, that this

774
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:42,720
story is a great story if you want to remain on the underside and the bottom side of history all

775
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:51,200
the time. And so to encourage people in my vocation to take that leap, I take it very, very seriously,

776
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:58,720
you know. So mystery, the searching for the core of cores, the meta beyond the meta.

777
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,520
How do we move beyond the sense of paralysis and decision fatigue into actually stepping into

778
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:11,520
something that we could positively reconstruct name that we're positively constructing, or are we

779
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:18,160
just kind of stuck with our same old epistemology problems? I think there's a couple of related

780
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:23,120
questions in there. And I'll tackle one first, and it might answer all of them, I'm not sure. But

781
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:28,960
I actually love this image of the core of cores. So we'll take that in a very sincerely ironic way

782
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:33,280
and like really run with it. Okay, so like imagine a mandala, right? It's sort of a series of

783
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:39,520
concentric circles, right? And when you think about that structure, you can see that it's sort of

784
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,200
like a, you know, you can also think of it in sort of a Venn diagram way that like, you know,

785
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:47,680
what's at the center is sort of in all of the things, right? Now, if you think about this

786
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:52,080
complexification thing I've been talking about, and which relates directly, by the way, to being

787
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:56,320
able to see more and more perspectives and more and more lenses, that you see that the

788
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:00,240
complexification of meaning gets us to these places. And so we're taking in more and more

789
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:05,520
perspectives. But then the question is, what's the core of cores? If there were a core of cores,

790
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:14,880
then we would have good cause to, let's say, always be able to rest in something. I want to

791
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:21,280
come back and qualify this in a second. But what I want to suggest is love. It's not, I don't think

792
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:25,600
of this so much as a leap of faith, which for me still rings with all this propositional logic and

793
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:34,000
maybe even some kind of relational interpersonal logic or something. But love is the vibe. Okay,

794
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:40,480
you know, love is the vibe. And, and what I mean by that is that it's true at all levels,

795
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:45,520
right? That there's no point where you can get to the complexification of something or you get

796
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:50,080
to a new perspective. And all of a sudden, you're totally justified to be an asshole, you know,

797
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:56,560
doesn't work that way. There's like, you can go down to the most, you know, simple, or pure,

798
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:02,080
or whatever kind of, you know, language you want to use for this kind of, even very naive faiths.

799
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:08,560
And you'll find agape and eros and other kinds of love, phyllo. But you'll find the sense of

800
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:13,280
connection, of harmony, of moving, of wanting to bring together and to unite. And, you know,

801
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:16,960
then you can start getting into theologies of love and everything, which Kierkegaard did too.

802
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:22,800
But, but that, but you can also then zoom out, right? And you can also see that there's this,

803
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:28,080
this operates to at like, you know, these levels that we're talking about of metamodern,

804
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:35,440
self reflexive recursivity and all this stuff. But it's like, we're still engaged in a connection

805
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:42,400
that is not lost or torn asunder by the complexification of it all. And that actually,

806
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:47,680
as you're able to see more and more of reality and see more and more perspectives and more and more

807
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:52,000
of the truth, and as that reality discloses itself to you, and you have more pieces and parts to

808
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,520
work with, the love is what is binding all those pieces together, so that you're seeing just more

809
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,720
and more of the way that love, you know, as Dante would say, you know,

810
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:09,840
causes the planets to dance around the stars. So that would be my initial answer is that the vibe

811
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:16,400
is love and the core of cores is love. And, and that you can think about that as being the thing

812
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,480
that binds those together. Now, fascinating, or maybe bizarre as it may sound, this was something

813
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:26,080
I've got from synthesizing metamodernisms, at least, you know, what I would, a pattern I was

814
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:31,280
picking up in a lot of people talking about this, you've got Alexander Dumitrescu talking about,

815
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,520
you know, this sort of kindness and Jacob's Ladder, you've got Vermeulen and von Daneker

816
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:40,080
talking about Eros and sort of the Metaxi binding the different finite and infinite.

817
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:45,600
You've got, you know, the Hansi-Frinach stuff and the whole complexity aspect of this really

818
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:52,000
kind of filling in this neo-Aristotelian leveled ontology, and connecting that to psychology

819
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:57,920
in the ways that this sort of complexification leads to increasing degrees of embrace, I guess,

820
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:02,640
is what Susan Cook-Groeter would call it, but the increasing levels of intimacy and connection

821
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:08,400
with other people, and that that becomes sort of the telos, you could say, that like whatever that

822
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:15,120
is is simultaneously the core of cores, but it's also that that emanating reality that's sort of

823
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:20,080
unfolding more and more of itself, and that somehow in the great, you know, paradoxical

824
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:27,120
vision of the mystics, the center is also their circumference, you know, and the origin is also

825
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:34,240
the destination. So that would be kind of a meta-modern mystical response to that question,

826
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:39,200
which I think begins more immediately from like a practical concern of like, how then, you know,

827
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:44,400
how then shall we live our lives? Sort of a thing. So the first answer I think is just sort of like,

828
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:49,680
well, you know, and this is the end of one of the great takeaways of that meta-modern film I

829
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:56,000
mentioned everywhere, everything everywhere at once, which is be kind. Be kind, especially when

830
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,520
you don't know what's going on, and we don't know what's going on, and we can expect that we should

831
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:07,920
always have our lenses ripped from our faces, and we see a whole new level of reality, and that our

832
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,920
senses of ego and worldview get deconstructed, and we've got to rebuild. There's always so

833
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,920
much that we don't know, and this profound uncertainty in the chaos that's beyond our

834
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:21,360
minimal complexity to be able to make sense of. So that's always going to be the case, but there's

835
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:26,720
always this enduring sense of be kind. And if you can start there, then you're probably doing

836
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:32,560
the most important thing. And then we can, you know, talk about whether any of the other stuff

837
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:38,720
makes any sense. Yeah, that's beautifully stated. That does remind me of what Aquinas argued that

838
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:46,560
Caritas was the highest virtue, that there was some superlative virtue up above all of them. And I

839
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:54,880
do think, at the end, you know, maybe this is kind of still kind of like an existentialist wager

840
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:01,600
here that I've always looked at that Brendan and gone, all right, what would be the worst,

841
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:07,520
and maybe this is some sort of like Pascal's wager sort of deal here, but what would be the

842
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:13,680
worst that would come of my life if I actually gave myself in love to seeking the good of the

843
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:20,560
other when I encounter them. And if I made that, and if I actually trusted that at the core of

844
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:30,720
cores, you know, that that was the thing that brought everything to be was a desire to connect,

845
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:35,680
it's a desire for communion. And at the very center of it was loving communion. I mean,

846
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:40,480
there's certainly, I'm not saying Christianity is the only story that has that, but I do look at

847
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:44,480
that and go, these are the sorts of things that for me, Brendan, I go, all right, I'm very aware

848
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:51,600
that I'm in a story. But this one, at least on those levels, it matches up for me, right? And

849
01:21:51,600 --> 01:22:00,800
if at the end, I end up being wrong, I think I still don't think I would have as many regrets

850
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:10,320
as if I rejected that premise, I rejected the way of love, I rejected seeking the good of the

851
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:17,280
other. If I rejected that and pursued my own selfish ends, I think I've been bedside for people

852
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:25,520
who, pardon me, in those dying moments of life. And it bends bedside with people that have given

853
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:35,840
themselves to that. And if in the end, it's just all, you just head into the void. And that,

854
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:42,480
what was it in everything everywhere? Once the, the everything bagel of, yeah, everything bagel

855
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:46,640
of nothingness, if that just consumes us all in the end, I know there's a point in which,

856
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:50,320
you know, the possible argued, you know, if there is no resurrection, then, you know, we are to be

857
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:54,320
pitied among all people. And I'm pretty much an idiot for giving my life to this. But I still

858
01:22:54,320 --> 01:23:04,640
think there's probably something of a Pascalian wager that not, not, not the way it's often

859
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:11,040
used in cliches, but the sense that what you're talking about, I don't know. But I know the

860
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:21,920
difference in my life when I've given myself to my ego versus giving myself to truly seeking the

861
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:28,080
good of my neighbor, those around me of loving God and loving other people. And then believing

862
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:34,240
that at the very core, of course, that there is, you know, Stanley Grence's book, Theology for

863
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:38,800
the Community of God, this is his argument that, you know, one of the distinctions for the Christian

864
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:47,200
story is the story of, at the very core of cores, you have a communion within a Godhead. And I'm

865
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:52,400
not asking, you know, you do agree with that or listeners to agree with that sentiment. But for

866
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:57,680
me, I find that picture compelling, that there is loving communion at the center in which we are

867
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:03,440
being enveloped into. If in the end, I'm wrong. I don't know. What's, what's the worst that come

868
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:10,640
with me, I suppose? Yeah, I mean, you know, yes, I, for me, the Kierkegaardian leap was really

869
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:20,960
a crucial transition moment in my life for getting out of nihilism, let's say. And I think that that

870
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:26,800
leap, you know, Kierkegaard had a stage model, right, of faith, basically, of the other religious

871
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,880
life. And it begins in aestheticism and, you know, goes into the ethical realm and into religious

872
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:36,880
religiosity. So he was using a stage model. And I think, I mean, I think that there's something

873
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:41,120
about what he's talking about that actually does fit into like a certain stage approach to

874
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:47,920
the religious life. I think for me, where it resonates most though, is it's what you do when

875
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:53,520
you're at the, in the bottom of the abyss of nihilism, that to me is where you make the Kierkegaardian

876
01:24:53,520 --> 01:25:00,080
move. And one of the things that I find interesting about that, though, is part of what happens with

877
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:04,880
those stage transitions is that by the time they've sort of played themselves out and gotten,

878
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:09,440
they've sort of, there's like a seed there that then grows into something and the thing it grows

879
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:14,160
into is very different than the thing it was, if that makes any sense. And so I think that

880
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:20,240
while that leap of faith move is crucial, I think that at least in my experience, it was doing that

881
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:27,280
in that moment that then got me in a place where I could sort of climb out of the abyss

882
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:33,440
and then look back and be like, Oh, man, I used to be down in that abyss. Right. But I would never

883
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:37,360
have been able to do that had I not made that leap of faith. And so in that new leap of faith,

884
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:43,600
it was a, it was a genuine moment of, of actual nihilism, really, because, and this is another

885
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:49,040
interesting way in which, you know, logics in a kind of Hegelian way, negate their own negation

886
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:52,720
and then turn into different things, right? Because nihilism itself gets you to a point where you

887
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:58,880
can then affirm anything, including faith, you can become so meaningless in your life that you can

888
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:03,920
then just choose meaning. And it's fascinating that if you actually do that and play that out,

889
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:07,200
you can get out of that abyss, look down and be like, Oh, yeah, I used to believe in no meaning.

890
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:12,320
That's wild. But you got there because you, you made a ladder for yourself and you climbed on

891
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:16,000
top of yourself to get out. Or, you know, someone could say you were climbing on top of more than

892
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,200
that. So yeah, I guess the point I want to make is that I think that what you're describing is very

893
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:26,160
real and important. But I think I want to encourage people to that. I think that there's also something

894
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:33,040
beyond the leap of faith that it's like you're leaping. You do, you can, let's say, land somewhere

895
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,680
that might not be an eternal landing place, because again, in the sort of endlessly

896
01:26:37,680 --> 01:26:44,640
shifting sands, right, that they do keep changing. But, but you do land somewhere and that the leap

897
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:49,760
in retrospect becomes something different from that vantage than what it was when it was initiated.

898
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:53,680
And so, yeah, I guess I wanted to make that point.

899
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:59,680
Yes, that's great. I'm glad you bring that up, Brendan, because there would be some confusion

900
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:05,200
there for some that might think, and maybe this is part of what we're processing in the Meta-Modern

901
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:13,520
Age is like, is the answer simply to go back, right, to go back like re-enchantment, is re-enchantment

902
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:18,960
simply going back? Do we just need to somehow get back to the medieval worldview and mindset?

903
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:26,720
No, there's a reason why we had to come out of that, right? And this isn't to fall for the trap

904
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:33,600
of the inevitability of progress. I'm not suggesting that, but there is even within,

905
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:41,360
for me, the Kierkegaardian model, and for me, within the Christian story, there has to be a

906
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:49,440
recognition of the perpetual transcendent nature of God. And so, you have these signposts and you

907
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:55,840
can't settle for the signpost unless they become the idol, right? So, you move beyond that, and

908
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:02,160
there's a constant moving beyond, but it's not a moving beyond that should lead you to feel like

909
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:07,200
I could never take a first step. And I think that's the thing I'm trying to work through and help

910
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:16,880
people work through is like the first step out of the pit, out of the abyss. And I think that's

911
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:25,440
where John has been really, really helpful. I haven't been... I'm going to word this carefully.

912
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:36,320
I have my disagreements with kind of Peterson's maybe post-daily wire kind of turn, but I think

913
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:43,040
Peterson's greatest strength was at least helping people go take the first step out of the abyss.

914
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:52,480
There's an abyss there. Make a movement. That is a kind of... That's Camus. That is kind of the

915
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:58,960
existentialist impulse, like radically rebel against the abyss in some way. Yeah. And I think,

916
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:03,840
I mean, this might be, hopefully, I've somewhat ingratiated myself, but here's where maybe I've

917
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:11,280
become very challenging as well, because part of me sees the process itself as destroying our idols,

918
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:15,440
which means sometimes... No, I'm not going to say sometimes. It means destroying various forms of

919
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:22,080
Christianity, maybe very, very precious forms, those earlier enculturated forms that we grew

920
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:28,240
up with that was our place where we had a firm foundation. For me, the spiritual life and spiritual

921
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:36,960
development is about being able to grapple with having your whole religious worldview crumble

922
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:43,520
and then get out of that abyss onto a new place, but then also accept that it's not like, okay,

923
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:49,680
now I'm safe. It's that if we really accept the eternally kind of self-transcending aspect of the

924
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:57,840
divine, then we have to take seriously that every solid ground is going to be liable for

925
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:04,160
deconstruction, basically. And I guess I'd want to invite people to see that process, not as an

926
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:10,560
inhibition towards growth or faith or any of that. It's just that's the faith journey. It's like,

927
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:19,840
you get closer to God, I think, by continually killing God, if I can be so violent about it.

928
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:25,200
But I mean, the whole death of God notion that Nietzsche presents us is, in a postmodern moment,

929
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:30,720
lands as this abyss of nihilism. But when you see that it's actually the recursive movement of the

930
01:30:30,720 --> 01:30:36,960
killing of God, that actually is what teaches you that there is a God beyond God, there is a God

931
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:42,560
beyond every single idol that you set up. And I highly recommend the work of Jean-Luc Marion,

932
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:49,360
who is very helpful for me on this bit, of God without being, which again, puts us into a new

933
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:54,720
area of sort of apophatic mysticism. He draws a lot on pseudo-dionysius. But the whole notion is

934
01:30:54,720 --> 01:31:02,560
that we have these conceptual idols, and that we need to really take seriously the idea that every

935
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:07,040
single notion, do I want to say that? I think so. I'll be absolutely autistic for a second.

936
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:13,840
Every single notion that we have of God is wrong, and that we should be okay with that,

937
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:18,880
that this is the upside of deconstruction. And I want to obviously qualify that with some of the

938
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:22,000
things I was saying about the core, of course, and you know that there's love. And so I'm not

939
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:25,200
trying to say that like we can all find out that God's is evil monster or something, right?

940
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:31,600
That's not my point. My point is that if we are using images and symbols and myths and stories

941
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:40,160
and worldviews as our story that we are affirming, great. But then we know that we're using the story

942
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:47,200
and then also be open to when the cracks show up in that story, that we can push that story over

943
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:51,680
and transcend to some new thing. And that's going to be a storyless moment for a while,

944
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:56,480
it's going to be falling through a vertiginous space of nihilism, potentially, or confusion,

945
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:02,320
disorientation. But that is part of the recursive process of reflection, and that in the process

946
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:10,080
we're getting closer to that emanating truth of reality, not farther away from it. So I would

947
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:15,760
throw that out there, and it's a very, it might seem, I don't know, bleak or something, and maybe

948
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:22,800
it is, but I mean, there's an element to which if we really take seriously the sublimity and the

949
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:30,000
grandeur of ultimate divinity, then we should be epistemically humble to see that pretty much

950
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:37,120
everything that we're using to kind of gesture towards that is the crudest of representations,

951
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:40,720
and ultimately they are representations, and therefore they're ultimately idols. So

952
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:46,800
there's a metamodern notion from, I'll just say the last thing, so Hansi Freinacht is a

953
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:51,760
metamodern thinker, he talks about the image of the headless God as sort of his icon for the

954
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:57,440
divine, because it's that God that can continually have his head chopped off, so to speak, that can

955
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:05,600
keep coming back, that is really what deserves our awe and reverence. So yeah, I hope people get

956
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:12,880
a sense of how what seems like the end of faith and religion and just this total

957
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:18,560
consummation of a nihilistic postmodernism can be worked through in a way that recursively

958
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:24,560
reaffirms itself to a point that you can see that there's a deep structure of meaning under all of

959
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:31,120
this. Yeah, I think maybe I'll throw out a couple, maybe different words, and maybe we're in agreement,

960
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:35,040
maybe we're in disagreement on that, and that's totally fine to be in disagreement on it as well.

961
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,640
You're saying there are different perspectives? What are you talking about?

962
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:45,360
I would maybe frame it as like our pictures are incomplete instead of all idolatrous.

963
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:52,560
I think for me would be at the core of idolatry is settling for the image as the final,

964
01:33:54,160 --> 01:34:00,400
and so where it becomes idolatry is not in the announcement of it being true, good, or beautiful,

965
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:06,880
but in the finality of that particular picture, which is I do think at the core of the Hebrew

966
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:13,520
tradition, which is really fascinating, why the prohibition of making images of God is so fascinating

967
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,440
given the cultural context. Now you could say, well, they still made the Ark of the Covenant and

968
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:23,360
things like that, but still there were very, very strong prohibitions on trying to come up with a

969
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:29,280
particular idol that would represent God in the same way that you might see across other cultures,

970
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:35,680
and I think there's something to that, and yet I think my, I don't know if I'd say pushback,

971
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:43,600
or maybe it's a qualification or a point of seeing if we're on the same page in this or not,

972
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:49,600
is to say, okay, but I also don't want to do the move where I have to be the,

973
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:58,640
all of history begins afresh with me, and so I'm starting without any received

974
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:03,280
tradition, without any sense in which, yes, affirming the transcendence of God, but also

975
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:10,400
affirming the imminence of God. So God has wanted to make himself, at the nature of love,

976
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:15,200
would be some desire of intelligibility. To me, this grounds all of our scientific endeavors,

977
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:19,520
right, is that the world is, to some degree, another intelligible because it's given to

978
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:25,520
us as a gift. And with that, there are images that may still need to be corrected. But I think,

979
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:29,520
bring this up because I think I've, as a practical point, I know a lot of people

980
01:35:30,160 --> 01:35:38,640
have personally found some sense of transformation and actually revisiting old practices from their

981
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:45,600
past that they maybe thought there was no value to. I think of even something simple

982
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:51,440
is the practice of someone revisiting an old song. So quick story, and I don't want to respect

983
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:57,200
your time too, Brendan, so we won't take too much longer here. But there was a guy at our church

984
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:00,240
who several weeks ago, maybe a couple months ago, came up to me and he's like,

985
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:06,080
you know, I really appreciate the songs that we sung together because they brought me back

986
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:12,400
to this moment. And he was a guy that was a Vietnam vet and he showed up at a Billy Graham

987
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:17,840
crusade one time just to, because the girl that he was interested in was going to the Billy Graham

988
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:23,360
crusade. And he spent the whole time at the Billy Graham crusade mocking it until finally the,

989
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:27,520
you know, the infamous Billy Graham altar call happened. And for some reason he tells the story,

990
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:33,120
he's like, I was making fun of the whole experience, the whole time, all it was there was just try to

991
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:38,720
get with this girl. At the very end, I found myself compelled for something beyond me to run to the

992
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:44,640
altar. And my entire life changed in that moment. And when I hear these songs, they bring me back

993
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:52,960
to that moment of transformation. I would be reluctant to say that the journey of perpetual

994
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:59,520
transformation would require that we have to disassemble all of those experiences down to the

995
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:04,080
studs. And I don't, it doesn't seem like that that'd be what you're saying is instead maybe

996
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:10,880
like maintaining a posture of epistemic humility to there being limitations to them.

997
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:15,360
Because otherwise, I think I don't know how we would get beyond the point of

998
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:25,440
there would, how do we, yeah, and then there's this dance here to get to a journey

999
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:33,760
requires a belief that there is someplace to go to. But it also requires the knowledge

1000
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:41,360
that you have accumulated for how to use particular skills and resources to even make

1001
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:48,720
a movement in a particular direction. And so I think that's the tension like I experienced

1002
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:53,040
in this, because I do see a lot of people that, especially in our generation younger,

1003
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:58,720
who might say, okay, I recognize that all of these stories and all these images of God are

1004
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:04,400
always going to be broken. So one of my choices here is I will, I will never plug into any sort

1005
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:09,120
of traditional religious community because everything that came from the past is ultimately

1006
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:13,680
going to lead me. And what I often see just as a practical point is a lot of people get involved

1007
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:20,160
into the kind of like DIY spiritualities in which they're continually functioning as like,

1008
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:24,400
I'm the self author. And then we're kind of like back at that same sort of point of the

1009
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:29,600
atomized individual who now most can come and then they get involved in some sort of weird

1010
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:36,320
cult where you think the, you know, you think the sex scandals that go through churches are bad,

1011
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:43,840
wait till you get involved in some of these like guru sex cults. So yeah, that's just kind of like

1012
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:49,600
the back and forth I'm experiencing the tension about the images of God and the idolatry that

1013
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:54,560
can come with them, but also recognizing like, I don't have to start from scratch. There's received

1014
01:38:54,560 --> 01:39:00,080
an inherited wisdom that we're actually referring to these people who we say they've got some glimpse

1015
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:05,280
of it. And that gives us a vantage point to stand on and gives us some sort of, yeah,

1016
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:11,440
gives us a house to live in as opposed to possibly feeling like we're always remodeling,

1017
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:15,920
you know, all the time. Gosh, I mean, you know, this could be, I mean, there's, you just outlined

1018
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:20,480
such important things. And I feel like this could be the beginning of a whole new conversation

1019
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:24,720
or not a new one, but there's like, there's at least an hour and a half to talk about this. But

1020
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:33,520
briefly, I mean, to tackle some of that. Yes, I get that. I think that

1021
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:46,960
I probably do skew a bit towards the, how do I put it? I mean, yes, you're identifying something

1022
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:50,560
in what I'm saying, which is true, which is this, you know, there's this recursive deconstruction

1023
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:55,600
process. And when I think what you're saying is like, yeah, but like, we have to live somewhere

1024
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:59,360
and like, can't we eventually kind of, you know, like be okay with where we're at and all that.

1025
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:03,440
And I want to honor that beyond that, beyond that, Brandon, I'll just throw this one other

1026
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:08,400
point is like, especially when we think about raising children, grandchildren, yeah, yeah,

1027
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:14,640
then what do we pass on not just individually, but how do we help our kids enter into a story

1028
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:19,280
that we actually think leads to their good and they're flourishing. Yeah. And I don't want to

1029
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:24,960
see my kids go through like perpetual deconstruction. I don't like I want them to come face to face

1030
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:31,600
with idols that are unhealthy, that are leading to disorder, to ruin in their lives and the lives

1031
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:37,040
of other people. But I wouldn't, you know, the things that I've gone through, I wouldn't wish

1032
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:41,760
on my children. Yeah, I know, but it's also like, you're a great guy. So like, maybe you had to go

1033
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:46,160
through some of that, you know what I mean? Like, honestly, though, it's like, I've had this conversation

1034
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:50,000
a number, well, broach this conversation a couple of times with people in terms of like,

1035
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:55,360
this is this is partly the issue of suffering, right? I mean, you know, I, I, yeah, the idea

1036
01:40:55,360 --> 01:41:04,000
that experiencing your kids experiencing suffering is, is suffering. But at the same time, like,

1037
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:11,040
puberty sucks, man, you know what I mean? And like, growing up is hard. And so there has got

1038
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:15,200
to be some allowance for like, you know, but I think what you're also naming there was something

1039
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:21,360
really important, which is that our, our whatever, let's say you use the word images, I guess,

1040
01:41:21,360 --> 01:41:25,120
because idols can be very loaded. And I do want to collapse a little bit some of this

1041
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:29,440
hard distinction between idol and image, right? Because it's like, I think we should also be

1042
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:37,040
okay with with the fact that we're not getting the absolute, right? We might be, we might be selling,

1043
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:43,040
you know, it's like, we're, you know, the perfect shouldn't be the enemy of the good sort of a thing,

1044
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:47,040
right? It doesn't mean that like, just because we can't continually bask before the eternal face

1045
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:51,040
of God in the Imperium doesn't mean that like, we, you know, should just give up on the whole

1046
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:56,320
religion thing. So, but what I was going to say was that I think you're naming a really important

1047
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:02,160
dynamic, which is the notion of development, that what role development plays in all of this. And

1048
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:08,320
by development, I mean, psychological development, I mean, the journey that we make from being an

1049
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:12,960
infant to a young child to an adolescent to an adult and then to an mature adult, etc. Like,

1050
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:20,320
that is an arc. And that faith is going to look different. Religion is going to look different.

1051
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:25,120
Our God concepts are going to look different along that journey. And for this, I mean, you know,

1052
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:29,440
James Fowler has done great work. There's excellent work on this topic that I think people should

1053
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:34,480
be taking very seriously. And all this ties directly in actually to what I was talking earlier about

1054
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:39,920
successively de centering and acknowledging perspectives, because it's the same mechanism

1055
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:44,560
that allows our God concept to evolve and change and grow. So I want to name all that.

1056
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:49,760
And I also want to name that different people are going to sort of, you know,

1057
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:54,560
settle in a particular spot on their developmental journey in different places than others, right?

1058
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:59,440
And, and not everyone's going to be called to a life of mysticism, you know, not everyone wants

1059
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:05,120
to be a desert hermit, you know, whether or not desert hermitage is even, you know, an ideal is

1060
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:10,320
a different topic. But like, let's just say the religion, religion has always appreciated the

1061
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:13,920
fact that like, different people are on that journey and doing different aspects of it and

1062
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:18,800
following it to different degrees. There's esoteric and esoteric elements to this and all that.

1063
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:24,400
People have even challenged me like, is apophatic mysticism a legitimate basis for

1064
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:28,720
religiosity? Like, how do you cohere a bunch of people around an absent center? I mean,

1065
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:35,440
I think you make a compelling connection to the idea of, you know, an iconism in the Hebrew

1066
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:40,480
tradition that literally did just that. So I think there are models for it. So I want to say all

1067
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:46,960
that. I also want to say that, that I do think that there can be very healthy expressions of DIY

1068
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:51,360
religion. And I have a whole way of thinking about this, which, you know, might, yeah, again,

1069
01:43:51,360 --> 01:44:01,280
goes into different terrains. But I see God as continuing to evolve. And that might be maybe a

1070
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:05,680
kind of strange or even heretical idea to some folks. But if you really do take everything

1071
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:09,680
that we've been saying seriously about this, you know, unfolding disclosure, you could even call

1072
01:44:09,680 --> 01:44:15,840
it unfolding revelation, then of course, our concept of God keeps changing and evolving. And

1073
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:20,080
indeed, when you look back in history, you see that the notions of God do change and evolve,

1074
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:24,080
and that they do move from, you know, more kind of mythological versions to more kind

1075
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:30,240
of moral philosophical visions to transcendent and then into, you know, so, and interestingly,

1076
01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:34,800
those pair very, very fascinatingly with the kinds of developmental trajectories that we

1077
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:39,440
see at the individual level too. So but again, different story. So what I'm saying is that it

1078
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:45,600
might be very serious that some people feel like they are called to sort of push into new terrain

1079
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:51,920
and in almost prophetic calling, try to speak new elements and new aspects of the divine into the

1080
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:58,720
world. And that there are interesting and important ways that that kind of work can be done seriously

1081
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:05,840
and not just sort of a new age DIY buffet style pick and choose approach, right? So I'm just hitting

1082
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:13,040
a bunch of points here. But to get back to the main thing, I guess I just I do maybe because I've

1083
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:19,520
gone through multiple deconstruction experiences tend to be okay with the hard

1084
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:29,040
reality of owning and even valorizing, even sanctifying the inherent iconoclasm that goes

1085
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:38,480
into a life of faith, because God is always calling you to, you know, break down those images. And

1086
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:46,640
I've had to reimagine and re understand divine experiences in my life and things that have

1087
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:50,560
happened. And, you know, these sorts of things that were very meaningful to me that set me on a

1088
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:56,640
whole new path and gave me a whole new sense of my life, meaning and purpose and direction to have

1089
01:45:56,640 --> 01:46:02,720
those five years later be like, Oh, no, sorry, that that wasn't the thing, you know, and then

1090
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:07,600
like to have that happen multiple times, right? It's sort of like, so I guess I'm just naming

1091
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:13,040
all that. And I'm saying that, yes, not everyone needs to feel like that that the answer to all

1092
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:18,400
this is somehow like to just give up on this on any notion of stability or anything like that.

1093
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:23,600
But that there are ways of framing a lot of what I've said in social containers around development,

1094
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:28,240
education, building developmentally informed approaches to teaching, you know,

1095
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:35,200
catechism and faith and that's that really is appropriate to where people are at in life.

1096
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:40,000
And to also I guess this is the maybe this is the point that I'm really getting at is

1097
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:46,640
I think most people will be okay with that. People do I think eventually get not okay with

1098
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:55,360
challenging received images, symbols, rituals, paradigms, stories, myths. And that's most of

1099
01:46:55,360 --> 01:47:01,040
what I've had to bump up against in my own deconstructions and in, you know, what's happening

1100
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:04,960
with people around me and the people I care about and how I relate to them and all that. And I guess

1101
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:09,840
I just always want to plug the idea that like, when people are deconstructing when they are going

1102
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:16,640
through something radical in a worldview shift, like, there's a default assumption in religious

1103
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:23,600
communities that this is a falling away. It's a it's a it's a regression. It's a, it's a, yeah,

1104
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:32,000
the fallback. I forget there's kind of hostacy. Yeah, well, certainly. Yeah. Right. So there's

1105
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:37,520
that's just, I think, I think we religious communities are misoriented around those

1106
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:42,000
sorts of life events. And I think if we were to take them much more seriously and be able to

1107
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:50,720
appreciate that they are the dynamic living moments in the evolution of faith, not just

1108
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:55,840
for individuals, but for society and what can come out of those experiences, we would be better

1109
01:47:55,840 --> 01:48:00,080
off. And the last thing I'll say, because I'm rambling, is that I totally agree that we have

1110
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:05,520
this rich tradition to draw from. And we shouldn't, you know, Gerta said he who can't draw on 2000

1111
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:09,600
years of history is living from hand to mouth. So I'm not saying that like, oh, down with all the

1112
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:14,480
idols of the past either. But we should also take seriously that part of what we now have available

1113
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:21,760
to us is all the other religious traditions, right? You know, the Vedanta and neoplatonism and Zen,

1114
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:27,440
and, you know, all these different traditions that again, I think people maybe are a bit uncomfortable

1115
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:31,600
thinking about was like, well, yeah, we have tradition, but not those traditions, right?

1116
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:38,480
And so, you know, I think that there is profound wisdom out there in a lot of different traditions

1117
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:44,480
that we might want to consider folding that in as well. So yes, how do we, how do we navigate the

1118
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:49,360
tension and the, and, you know, between moving beyond the limitations of the past, but not,

1119
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:53,440
you know, throwing out the baby with the bathwater? That's a perennial issue. And how do we, how do

1120
01:48:53,440 --> 01:49:00,480
we find a sense of stability in a continually, you know, dynamic world upending potentially,

1121
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:05,840
you know, situation of flux, perennial tension? But these are the questions that we should like

1122
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:10,400
sort of be inviting the wrestling with, I think, as I've heard you talk about things and not just

1123
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:16,800
sort of, you know, immediately precluding them from the religious life. Yeah. And I'm really

1124
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:21,440
thankful for you sharing your perspective, Brendan, on this. And I'm glad, you know, even, you know,

1125
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:27,520
as the opponent processing happens, that's where a lot of this growth takes place. If we are serious

1126
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:36,720
about confessing our own limitations, our finitude, and even, you know, from a Christian,

1127
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:41,040
you know, historically Christian perspective, we are confessing not just our finitude as an

1128
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:47,520
inherent feature of being human, but some sense of like the depravity of our own condition to

1129
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:52,800
sometimes bend things towards our own will to bend things towards our own selfish output.

1130
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:58,720
Then we have to be open to having these sorts of dialogues where people aren't like necessarily

1131
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:03,440
eye to eye, but there's a there's an openness to actually going, Hey, I think there's growth

1132
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:07,120
happening. And I want to affirm that just I'm thankful for this dialogue, Brendan. And I'm

1133
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:11,840
thankful, hopefully listeners experience it from wherever context they sit, they find themselves

1134
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:18,480
situated in as a positive thing that produces growth in their life, and allows them to say,

1135
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:23,520
Hey, let me take my lenses off for a second, try some others on. And without doing that,

1136
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:33,200
I do think the sort of like naivete that leads to the kinds of stories that are used in oppressive,

1137
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:38,800
abusive ways, ways that don't have adherence to reality. If we're not checking up against this

1138
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:44,640
stuff, then we can we can be blindly participating in that. I just came to my head, maybe sometime,

1139
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:47,680
I don't want to throw this out there and impose upon them. But I was just thinking, boy, this

1140
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:52,640
really gets that I think it'd be really fun. And maybe I can invite them into it be fun to bring

1141
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:58,560
like john vervecky on and someone else like Paul van der clay to talk about, like the merits of

1142
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:03,920
kind of staying within a traditional religious tradition versus kind of like vervecky's project

1143
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,200
and what it seems like is in keeping with some of your project is to say, all right, can we

1144
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:13,920
take some of these and move them outside of the walls of traditional religious institutions?

1145
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:19,920
Which methodologies are better? Are there pitfalls or things we can learn from both strategies? And

1146
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:25,360
I think that might be fun if john and paul are listening, open invitation, and I don't know if

1147
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:28,560
you'd be open to doing something with that. But I think it'd be an interesting dialogue. Of course,

1148
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:33,600
I've been, I mean, that is the conversation with one of the major conversation that needs

1149
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:40,560
conversations that needs to be had. I've started to get into elements of that with my own conversations

1150
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:47,440
with with john vervecky. I'm actually, yeah, I have a open correspondence, meaning I reached out,

1151
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:52,720
haven't heard back yet, from Paul van der clay. So we might, we were thinking of talking anyway,

1152
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:59,440
but this would be a topic that I think would be perfect to to dive into. And so, yes, I'd

1153
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:04,320
definitely be open to that. One last thing I want to say, too, though, is, is, is just that

1154
01:52:05,200 --> 01:52:10,400
the images that we use of great value that come from our traditions, also, we're always

1155
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:16,960
deepening our understanding and our interpretations of them, right? I certainly, you know, a,

1156
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:23,760
a minister of say 70 years old is going to have a very different conception of Jesus,

1157
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:28,800
even then, you know, a five or seven year old, right? So like, and that we can take to take

1158
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:36,480
those changes seriously. And yet, they still continue to persist and give that sort of continuity

1159
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:42,880
and stability, even as there is evolving shifting notions. And then one of the challenges is how

1160
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:47,360
do we, how do we make sure that we're in harmony when someone's using this word in this way or

1161
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:54,960
this concept? And yet, this is a, again, a perennial issue in any religious context as people

1162
01:52:54,960 --> 01:53:00,800
continue to work with the ideas and deepen in their understanding of them. But that seems to be,

1163
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:05,040
personally, for me, the hardest thing to do myself with some traditional material is,

1164
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:09,600
is how to work with it from a new perspective or a new vantage that I can still affirm,

1165
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:14,000
you know, are we ever in a position to be like, no, that's totally, we can't do anything with

1166
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:19,040
that one, you know, or, or what have you, because it's, you know, people speak very eloquently

1167
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:24,720
often, including yourself about drawing on this tradition and interpreting some of its ideas

1168
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:29,760
in a way that I find, yes, you know, like I'm there with you, but then maybe enter a congregation

1169
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:34,960
and you're expected to affirm a certain notion, theological notion or, or, or, you know, a creedle

1170
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:38,720
or a dogmatic notion that's like, well, wait a second, that's not quite what I meant by

1171
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:44,960
God or salvation or, or love even so. But yeah, so yeah, yeah.

1172
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:48,240
You've nailed it. You've nailed it right there. I think deepening is a really good word. I think

1173
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:54,080
that might be, that might be a word that you could find harmony between people within the

1174
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:59,600
traditional religious communities still and those that might be kind of trying to work outside of

1175
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:06,240
the bounds of that because deepening is I think a helpful picture that combats I think something

1176
01:54:06,240 --> 01:54:11,760
lots of traditionally religious people are, are suspicious of and I'm not saying it's accurate

1177
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:16,000
and good for them to be suspicious, but I'm confessing even my own suspicion of the,

1178
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:20,240
the kind of narrative that progress is any movement in any direction as long as we're

1179
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:26,480
moving away from the past. Yeah, right. And so that, that notion seems to be not helpful in

1180
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:30,880
many regards. So maybe there's a deepening and like you're saying, the deeper we get in some

1181
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:37,760
subjects and some pictures, the more we realize, yeah, there might not be any goodness, truth,

1182
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:43,920
or beauty in this image to hold on to anymore. And, but we only get that through these sorts

1183
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:48,720
of dialogues, Brendan. And I think what the dynamic you just named also is, is to bring this back to

1184
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:52,720
the meta modern conversation. I think that that's informing a lot of people's perspective in the

1185
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:58,080
sense of it was a very modernist notion of, you know, anything moving ahead and away from the past

1186
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:03,360
is good. And of course, you get that deconstructed. But I think people in a meta modern position are

1187
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:10,080
certainly skeptical of that. They're skeptical of the skepticism of tradition as well. And so

1188
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:16,560
I think you're seeing a lot of openness and interest in traditional forms of religiosity

1189
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:20,960
for that reason. People don't feel like it has to be, again, that kind of false binary. So

1190
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:26,720
yeah, this has been really wonderful. I really appreciate you having me on and getting to talk

1191
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:30,720
about this stuff. It's been a pleasure. Thanks for your generosity with your time too, as well.

1192
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:34,400
You know, before we recorded, you were asking how long this goes, hour to hour and a half,

1193
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:37,760
but if we're really cooking close to two hours, I guess we must be really cooking because we're

1194
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:42,400
close to two hours. So thanks. And I'm serious, I would love to maybe find some other time to

1195
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:47,360
have continued dialogues, bring some other partners in that can can help enhance and expand

1196
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:50,800
our framework here. This has been a blast, Brendan. Thank you so much. That sounds great. At the very

1197
01:55:50,800 --> 01:55:54,800
least, you're welcome on the Meta Modern Spirituality podcast, and we can continue this conversation.

1198
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:58,480
But yeah, keep me posted. I'd be happy to talk with Paul and John for sure.

1199
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:07,360
Great. Thank you, Brendan. Thank you, man.
