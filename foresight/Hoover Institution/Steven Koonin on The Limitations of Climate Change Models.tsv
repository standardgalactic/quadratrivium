0	13000	OK, since this is a policy-oriented gathering,
13000	16320	I thought the best thing I could do as a scientist
16320	20640	was to lay out some of the factual context for climate
20640	24680	and the closely related subject of energy.
24680	28320	So if you listen to most of the political dialogue
28320	31560	and certainly the media, what you hear
31560	35000	is that climate science compels us
35000	39480	to make large and rapid reductions in greenhouse gas
39480	43680	emissions, take climate action immediately
43680	45680	and on a large scale.
45680	49080	And that is driven by the fact that global greenhouse gas
49080	56640	emissions have been rising at about 1.5% a year.
56640	62800	The UN says that we need to get to net zero emissions
62800	66720	by 30 years from now in order to, quote,
66720	70520	avoid the worst effects of climate change.
70520	77520	And they have various trajectories of emissions going forward.
77520	79120	Do I have a pointer, by the way?
79120	81000	I guess not.
81000	83640	As you can see there, emissions would
83640	88480	have to go to zero by 2050 or so if we
88480	90120	are to keep the global temperature
90120	95480	rise to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial.
98560	102200	You think about policy required to implement something
102200	106640	like that, and they have to strike a balance.
106640	110480	On the one side, we've got the certainties and uncertainties
110480	113040	of climate science, and I was amused
113040	115520	to hear during the banking talk yesterday
115520	120360	the reverence with which physics and chemistry are
120360	123800	treated in terms of the precision and certainty
123800	124840	of their understanding.
124840	128320	It's very much not the case.
128320	131080	And the hazards and the risks of a changing climate.
131080	134960	And on the other side, as we'll see the world's growing demand
134960	138880	for reliable, affordable, and clean energy.
138880	142440	Striking that balance is about policy.
142440	147280	You have to fold in values and priorities, environment
147280	152440	versus development, tolerance for risk, equity
152440	156560	across North-South and across generations,
156560	158800	and really do any of the responses
158800	162000	that you might make in policy, make a difference,
162000	165560	and how much will they cost.
165560	167400	And of course, it's in the center box
167400	172560	that I expect most of you are interested and focused.
172560	174160	So I want to take you through some
174160	178280	of the considerations involved in striking that balance
178280	181480	in the form of three high-level statements.
181480	184840	The first is that the notion of a climate crisis, which
184840	189760	you hear so often, has scant scientific support.
189760	194720	The climate today is not broken, and fears of future catastrophes
194720	198760	depend on extreme emission scenarios that
198760	205320	are fed into models that are entirely unsuited to the task.
205320	211760	And so if we act too rapidly and in an ill-thought-through way,
211760	216080	we will incur a greater threat to human well-being
216080	217720	than climate change itself.
217720	221400	And of course, I'm going to show you data and trends that
221400	223760	support these statements.
223760	228400	The second is that if you advocate for rapid or overly
228400	231640	rapid global decarbonization, you've
231640	235560	got a moral issue, which I will try to elucidate.
235560	238880	And the third is if you try to decarbonize too rapidly
238880	241760	at the national level, it's going
241760	245440	to be disruptive, expensive, and will ultimately
245440	249120	degrade national security.
249120	253080	Let me start with a definition first.
253120	256040	Weather is not climate.
256040	260720	Climate is the long-term average, typically 30 years,
260720	263360	of the properties of weather.
263360	267640	And that's nicely illustrated by this chart, which
267640	272280	shows about a 900-year-long record
272280	276680	of the annual height of the Nile River measured
276680	280280	during the summer minimum in Cairo.
280280	282600	The Egyptians, of course, cared a lot
282600	285520	about the height of the Nile, as did the people who
285520	288760	were ruling Egypt in any given time.
288760	290960	And what you see when you look at this graph,
290960	294800	the blue values are the annual values,
294800	299360	is that there's a lot of up and down from year to year.
299360	302200	One year, it could be up at almost 6 meters,
302200	308000	and the next year or so, it's down at 2 meters or 1 meter.
308000	312840	So that's whether it happens year to year.
312840	316600	The second is if you look at the 30-year average, which
316600	325240	is the red line, you can see that it also goes up and down a lot.
325240	329840	And if you were alive during the first 150 years of this record,
329840	333920	you would see the annual minimum going down and down.
333920	337600	And no doubt, some medieval Egyptian climate panel
337600	340320	would be screaming new normal, new normal,
340320	343960	and recommending prayers and sacrifice.
343960	348160	In fact, the climate varies a lot on its own.
348160	353360	Human influences were entirely absent during this time.
353360	357240	And if they had just waited a couple of hundred years
357240	361160	after 700, you see it comes back up quite a lot.
361160	365560	So you can get fooled a lot by year to year variability
365560	368200	or by variability over decades.
368200	372400	And untangling the response to human influences
372400	376040	from this natural variability of the climate system
376040	381120	is something that is a major challenge in the science
381120	381720	these days.
381720	385200	We do it a lot in the media.
385200	390400	The media entirely misrepresent the science.
390400	394120	Here's a little vignette.
394120	397520	NASA press release in March of 2020.
397520	402880	The Guardian used newspaper in the UK in December 2019.
402880	407720	Headline, Greenland's ice sheet is melting seven times faster
407720	410240	than in the 1990s.
410240	412720	And if you look in the text of the article,
412720	416800	the rate of ice loss has risen from 33 billion tons a year
416800	423120	in the 90s to 254 billion tons a year in the past decade.
423120	425360	That's a true statement.
425360	428000	But if you look at it in context,
428000	431160	it carries a very different message.
431160	435480	Here's the actual data compiled by the Danish
435480	438880	Meteorological Institute.
438880	443320	This is how much Greenland lost in ice year by year
443320	445360	averaged over 10 years.
445360	450160	And you can see that from 1990 to 2012 or so,
450160	452760	it did go up a lot.
452800	455080	It's a lot of part of this graph.
455080	459000	But if you look at the past almost 100 years,
459000	460760	it went up and down a lot.
460760	466080	And if you go back to 1930, when human influences were much
466080	468920	smaller than they are today, about one-fifth,
468920	472200	you can see that it was losing ice almost as much.
472200	479080	And even as the globe warmed from 1930 up to 2022,
479080	480800	the ice loss went up and down.
480960	485400	In fact, it's currently declining rather than going up.
485400	489120	So this is not global warming.
489120	490720	This is weather.
490720	492640	Turns out to be weather in the North Atlantic.
495280	497680	So it's impossible to talk about weather
497680	500400	without talking about the unusual heat
500400	503600	that we have seen this summer.
503600	505040	Here is context.
505040	509840	This is data from the US EPA, official government data.
509840	511120	It's the Heat Wave Index.
511120	514680	We can talk about how you define heat waves, but not now.
514680	520320	And you can see that in the last 40 years or so from 1980,
520320	522800	not much changed.
522800	525880	This does not include the last summer, of course.
525880	527400	We don't have that data yet.
527400	530160	But even so, one year is not going
530160	533040	to make all that much difference in a climate sense.
533040	536200	And it was a lot more active in terms of heat waves
536200	539440	in the 1930s than it is now.
539440	542400	Again, human influence is much smaller.
544920	547440	This is the satellite-derived record
547440	550240	of the global temperature, temperature of the lower
550240	554120	atmosphere, month by month.
554120	559920	And the last point in that graph is July 2023, last month.
559920	564760	And you can see, wow, big spike, right?
564760	568800	But when you look at it, you see other big spikes, mostly
568800	571240	due to El Ninos.
571240	576120	And you can see that there's a gradual long-term trend.
576120	579560	So however much the media and other folks
579560	584920	make of the unusually hot July that we have had,
584920	588280	that's not human influences.
588280	589720	It's weather.
589720	594800	The long-term trend in this data may well be human influences,
594800	598440	but they can't resist capitalizing on dramatic weather
598440	603000	events to make the point.
603000	604680	There it is.
604680	606320	What are the causes?
606320	609480	Maybe greenhouse gases, but that seems unlikely again,
609480	612880	because greenhouse gases act over long-time periods
612880	614480	smoothly.
614480	619080	El Nino, we are in the beginnings of another El Nino cycle.
619080	621960	There are other oscillations in the climate system
621960	625400	that are conspiring to work together.
625400	628880	Stratospheric water vapor is another explanation.
628880	633360	You may not know that in January of last year,
633360	637400	there was an enormous underwater volcanic eruption
637400	641080	that increased the water vapor in the upper atmosphere
641080	643480	by 10% to 13%.
643480	645640	You can see it here in this graph.
645640	650040	That big, dark blob at the end of the graph the most recent
650040	654080	years is the water vapor from this underground eruption,
654080	655480	undersea eruption.
655480	659480	And that increases the heat trapping of the atmosphere.
659480	661880	And then finally, we've been cleaning up
661880	664880	the lower atmosphere from coal emissions
664880	667840	and from ship emissions that allows the Earth
667840	669720	to absorb a little more sunlight.
669720	673920	And that's also playing a role in the recent warming.
673920	675120	Finally, urban heat island.
675120	678240	You hear a lot about records being broken.
678280	681840	Phoenix, Houston, and so on.
681840	685400	The temperature in the cities is hotter than the surroundings,
685400	688000	as much as five or six degrees.
688000	689960	And if you've got a weather station that's
689960	693120	in the middle of a city that's growing and growing and growing,
693120	696360	the heating of the city starts to affect whether you're
696360	698040	going to break a record or not.
702600	704400	Temperature is not the only thing
704400	706840	that is a manifestation of climate.
706840	711640	Of much greater concern are extreme weather events
711640	713400	and sea level rise.
713400	717800	This is a chart from the most recent UN report issued
717800	720760	about a year ago.
720760	724640	And the colors indicate whether a trend has been observed
724640	728320	or not in various phenomena.
728320	730960	The ones associated with heat and cold, well, yeah,
730960	732640	we've got more heat.
732640	736480	More heat waves globally, though not in the US,
736480	739280	less fewer cold spells.
739280	741960	But then there's a whole category of wet and dry
741960	744320	for which there is no trend.
744320	746800	There's a whole category of wind,
746800	750520	including tropical cyclones, hurricanes, typhoons,
750520	753760	again, for which there is no trend, et cetera.
753760	757600	So in fact, for most of the extreme weather events,
757600	762200	we have not seen trends over the last century.
762240	764520	Here's some of the text that goes along with it.
764520	770240	Low confidence in most reported long-term trends in hurricanes.
770240	773840	Low confidence in mid-latitude storms.
773840	778520	Tornadoes hail lightning, no trends, et cetera, et cetera.
778520	780960	The one in which there is confidence
780960	785640	is that we have seen some increase in heavy precipitation
785640	788000	on a global scale over land.
788000	789880	We can go on and on again.
789880	792680	Not a lot that gives us support
792680	795560	that there is a climate crisis underway.
797720	800000	Here's some of the data for hurricanes.
800000	803840	This is the record of the number of hurricanes globally.
803840	807080	Upper trace is all tropical storms.
807080	809560	Lower trace are hurricanes.
809560	813080	And this is a record that extends over 50-some-odd years.
813080	815720	It's hard to see any change at all.
816720	819800	This is a measure of hurricane activity.
819800	823640	It waits the strongest storms more than the weaker storms.
823640	827080	Again, globally in the top, northern hemisphere in the bottom,
827080	830360	lots of ups and downs over 50 years,
830360	832480	but it's hard to find any effect.
832480	837960	And in fact, the official reports say we can't find any trends.
837960	839880	I'm not going to go through the language,
839880	842640	but that's what it says.
842640	844640	By the way, I don't know if you'll have access
844760	848680	to the charts, but they have links to all of the supporting
848680	853880	either UN reports or quality peer-reviewed literature
853880	857400	in each of the statements.
857400	861200	So that's the climate of today and the past.
861200	863960	You might ask, what about the future?
863960	867400	Well, for that, we rely on models.
867400	869800	And one of the major measures of a model
869800	874800	is how sensitive is it to increasing the carbon dioxide?
874800	877600	If you doubled the carbon dioxide in the model,
877600	880680	by how much would the temperature go up?
880680	883200	And that's shown in this graph.
883200	886640	There are about 40 different models listed there.
886640	889800	They're produced by institutes and universities
889800	891600	around the world.
891600	896480	And what's parted is how sensitive the model is.
896480	901480	And the ones in yellow, about 40% of them,
901480	905440	were deemed too sensitive by the UN,
905440	908960	and so are not used at all.
908960	910760	That's a little bit scary.
910760	915000	The world's best models making their best tries
915000	919520	get it wrong 40% of the time.
919520	923520	It's even worse when you ask, how well do the models produce
923520	926400	the temperature history that we've seen?
926400	928440	And that's shown on these graphs.
928440	931880	The black is the actual observed temperature
931880	935280	rise of the globe, and the different traces
935280	937560	are the different models.
937560	940120	And you can see that many of the models
940120	943960	differ from the data or they differ from themselves
943960	946040	by more than the temperature rise
946040	949440	that they're trying to describe.
949440	951360	And in fact, even the climate models
951360	953840	don't believe their own models, at least
953840	955840	at the regional level.
955840	958480	Tim Palmer at Oxford and Bjorn Stevens,
958480	960840	who is the director of the Max Planck Institute
960840	964920	for Meteorology, says, for many key applications,
964920	969080	the current generation of models is not fit for purpose.
969080	973680	There's Bjorn, he gave a lecture at UCLA about a year ago,
973680	975840	and he says, it's difficult in many places
975840	979920	impossible to scientifically advise societal efforts
979920	983200	to adapt in the face of unavoidable warming.
983200	987040	We can't assess the extent to which a given degree of warming
987040	989640	poses an existential threat.
989640	994080	And there's Tim Palmer in an email not publicly published,
994080	998640	but broadly published in the National Academy membership.
998640	1001080	He says, our understanding of climate change,
1001080	1005560	especially at the regional scale, is rather poor.
1005560	1007760	How can a country adapt if it doesn't even
1007760	1010560	know the sign of precipitation change
1010560	1014240	as the IPCC figures show?
1014240	1015880	And he says, the policy and decision
1015880	1019680	make us start to feel uncomfortable when we say that.
1019680	1022920	They'd rather we didn't say such things in public.
1022920	1025480	They claim it undermines the public's faith
1025480	1028200	in the need to take action.
1028200	1033520	And I think this is a disease, a dysfunction of the science
1033520	1036280	in this particular field.
1036280	1039400	As a scientist, I think it's our duty
1039400	1043600	to lay out the science, knowns and unknowns,
1043600	1048400	transparently, completely, and without bias.
1048400	1050440	That's not happening.
1050440	1054160	I can tell you, show you specific examples.
1054160	1057800	All right, let's look at just one or two more model projections.
1057800	1059240	Sea level.
1059240	1062840	I live most of the time in Manhattan in New York City.
1062840	1066240	There's been a tide gauge at the foot of Manhattan
1066240	1071840	the southern tip for 150 years, maybe a little more.
1071840	1077120	This is the rate of rise of the sea
1077120	1081280	at the tip of Manhattan since 1920.
1081280	1085600	It averages about three millimeters a year, you can see.
1085600	1087200	But it goes up and down.
1087200	1091120	Three millimeters a year, by the way, is a foot a century.
1091120	1093560	NOAA, the part of the US government
1093560	1096120	concerned with oceans and atmospheres,
1096120	1099520	says that over the next 30 years,
1099520	1103680	this graph is going to do that.
1103680	1105920	Remarkable.
1105920	1108560	Who am I to challenge NOAA?
1108560	1112880	But we'll know soon enough whether that's going to happen or not.
1112880	1115840	And in fact, other researchers say,
1115840	1117920	you shouldn't be using these models
1117920	1120160	because they're not very precise.
1120160	1122040	They're not very accurate and so on.
1122040	1127160	Giving an impression of false confidence to users.
1127160	1128680	Well, if you can't believe the models
1128680	1131360	about what's going to happen going forward,
1131360	1134920	how might we get a handle on how things are going to change
1134920	1137360	as the globe warms?
1137360	1139400	Well, we can look at the past.
1139400	1143160	So here's the global average temperature since 1850.
1143160	1147600	And you can see that since 1900 or so,
1147600	1154440	it's gone up by about 1.3 degrees to the present.
1154440	1157840	That's just about the same amount of warming
1157840	1164800	that the UN predicts on average to the end of the century, 2100.
1164800	1166600	What will be the impacts?
1166600	1170600	Well, we don't know, but we can see how the globe has fared
1170600	1174160	during the previous 120 years.
1174160	1180400	And the answer is humanity has prospered as never before.
1180400	1183240	The global temperature went up by 1.3 degrees.
1183240	1186920	The population went up by a factor of 5.
1186920	1192960	Life expectancy went from 32 years to almost 73 years.
1192960	1196760	The literacy fraction jumped by a factor of 4.
1196760	1201400	GDP per capita went up by a factor of 7, et cetera, et cetera.
1201400	1203720	And the death rate from extreme weather
1203720	1208800	went down by a factor of 50, even as the globe
1208800	1213120	warmed 1.3 degrees.
1213120	1214840	That doesn't say things are going
1214840	1218080	to be perfect over the next 80 years,
1218080	1221880	but it sure gives some sense that humanity is perfectly
1221880	1228480	capable of adapting and flourishing as conditions change.
1228480	1232040	Here's one example of that, agriculture.
1232040	1237160	This is 60 years' worth of agricultural data globally.
1237160	1240080	The land area used for grain production
1240080	1243120	hasn't gone up at all, shown by the lower trace.
1243120	1245320	But the population, of course, has gone up.
1245320	1250240	The grain yield, which is how many bushels per acre you get,
1250240	1254560	or tons per acre, or whatever, has gone up spectacularly
1254560	1257080	as agronomy has gotten better.
1257080	1259800	And the grain production, how much grain
1259800	1265400	the world actually produces, has also gone up by 250%,
1265400	1269680	even as the globe warmed up.
1269680	1273840	If you look at weather losses, how much GDP
1273840	1277440	did you spend because of extreme weather events?
1277440	1279560	This is global data.
1279560	1281520	You can see, first of all, that it
1281520	1287520	hovers around a quarter of a percent of GDP.
1287520	1292360	Second, you can see it's actually gone down a little bit.
1292360	1295240	Again, people who are concerned will say, well,
1295240	1297040	this is just going to go up and up.
1297040	1299000	But in fact, as the world develops,
1299000	1302600	we get more and more resilient and able to deal
1302600	1304360	with extreme weather events.
1304360	1307000	And in any event, right now, it's only a quarter
1307000	1310920	percent of GDP globally.
1310920	1313480	What about the economic impacts?
1313480	1317640	Well, last March, about four months ago,
1317640	1321320	the White House put out a white paper
1321320	1325800	that summarized the result of 12 independent peer-reviewed
1325800	1333000	studies of how much warming would affect the US GDP.
1333000	1335600	This graph comes from that report.
1335600	1338560	And what you can see is that as the change
1338560	1341400	in global surface temperature, it's
1341400	1344640	in degrees Fahrenheit because this is a US graph.
1344640	1346080	But OK.
1346080	1349000	We're currently at that vertical line.
1349000	1351680	And you can see that it's expected
1351680	1357120	that warming has affected the US GDP.
1357120	1360000	Those different lines indicate different models.
1360000	1361920	The black line is the average.
1361920	1367200	You can see it's down at less than a tenth of a percent.
1367200	1370960	And that if we go out to the extreme end of this chart,
1370960	1375520	which is where we would be under the Paris 2 degree warming,
1375520	1378400	you can see it's still at 2%.
1378400	1384200	In other words, the economy would be 2% smaller in 2100,
1384200	1387440	let's say, than it would have been otherwise.
1387440	1389760	It's in the noise.
1389760	1392280	Bjorn Lomborg and another paper compiled
1392280	1397200	a similar set of estimates for the globe as a whole.
1397200	1403320	And again, the takeaway is a few percent for a few degrees.
1403320	1405600	Well, you might say, well, what about tipping points?
1405600	1408040	And of course, people have studied that as well.
1408040	1409040	There's a paper.
1409040	1413000	It's another 1% or 2% for the tipping points.
1413000	1417880	And so economically, this is in the noise.
1417880	1421880	Now, you might argue GDP is not the only thing that matters.
1421880	1425680	There will be differential impacts, poor people versus rich people,
1425680	1433440	et cetera, all true, but hardly a catastrophe or existential threat.
1433440	1436760	OK, let me turn to the second statement I wanted to make,
1436760	1442600	and that advocacy for rapid decarbonization globally is immoral.
1442600	1445280	And it starts with demographics.
1445280	1448800	This is the global population historically
1448800	1453400	and projected out to 2100.
1453400	1457920	And you can see we've just crossed 8 billion people right now.
1457920	1461560	And according to this projection, we'll get to 10 billion
1461560	1465240	by the end of the century.
1465240	1469600	Most of the growth between now and the end of the century
1469600	1474280	is in Asia and in Africa.
1474280	1477800	That means that the developed world, where there are one and a half billion
1477800	1481680	of us, is getting older.
1481680	1484040	The developing world is younger.
1484040	1488400	And urbanization is proceeding at a spectacular pace.
1488400	1490600	50 million people a year.
1490600	1495560	The equivalent to six New York cities a year are getting created.
1495560	1497560	Half of the world now is urbanized.
1497560	1501600	70% will be by the end of the century.
1502480	1506960	Steve Haber yesterday talked about the developed world bubble
1506960	1512000	we're sort of living in, I would say almost echo chamber.
1512000	1516000	This graph makes it rather apparent.
1516000	1520400	What's plotted here is for a number of representative countries
1520400	1522800	indicated on the right.
1522800	1525800	The annual energy consumption per capita.
1525800	1527800	How much energy did it get?
1527800	1530800	The annual energy consumption per capita.
1530800	1534800	How much energy did each person use?
1534800	1542800	Parted as a function of the GDP per capita in constant 2017 dollars.
1542800	1545800	And you can see that there are lots of interesting things
1545800	1548800	to understand about this chart.
1548800	1555800	Some of us in the US, Canada, some other very developed countries,
1556800	1558800	we sit in the upper right corner.
1558800	1563800	We have a relatively high GDP as a result.
1563800	1566800	In the middle of the graph you find the European countries
1566800	1568800	and a number of other middle countries
1568800	1571800	that use about half the energy per capita of the US
1571800	1574800	and have a somewhat smaller GDP.
1574800	1578800	And down on the lower left corner you see a set of countries
1578800	1582800	whose energy use increases universally
1583800	1588800	and monotonically as they get richer.
1588800	1590800	Richer countries use more energy
1590800	1593800	and when you're a developing country down on the lower left
1593800	1599800	your energy use is going to go up a lot as you become better off.
1599800	1603800	What is sobering about this chart
1603800	1606800	is that there are only one and a half billion people
1606800	1609800	in the upper parts of this chart.
1609800	1613800	If you go down to the bottom left you've got about six billion people.
1613800	1617800	And so it's pretty clear that as they improve their standard of living
1617800	1622800	by using more energy, the energy demand is going to go up.
1625800	1629800	People down there, maybe some of you come from those countries
1629800	1633800	that have been in them, life without energy is no fun.
1633800	1638800	It means cooking and heating with what's politely called
1638800	1642800	traditional biomass or wood and dung.
1642800	1645800	The indoor air pollution from that is terrible,
1645800	1649800	kills two million people a year.
1649800	1655800	Without 24-hour lighting, you've got to study under extreme conditions.
1655800	1658800	It's okay to eat romantically by candlelight,
1658800	1663800	but studying by candlelight is no fun.
1663800	1666800	The inequalities are astounding.
1666800	1674800	Nigeria consumes one-thirtieth the energy per capita that we do in the U.S.
1674800	1677800	And there are three billion people in the world,
1677800	1679800	three-eighths of the population,
1679800	1684800	that use less electricity per year than the average U.S. refrigerator.
1684800	1687800	And I will say with a little bit of embarrassment,
1687800	1691800	I have three refrigerators in my house in New York.
1694800	1698800	So if you combine the demographics of population growth
1698800	1702800	with the need for energy as you develop,
1702800	1706800	you get a strong growth in energy consumption.
1706800	1709800	This is shown projected out to 2050.
1709800	1713800	Again, you can see most of the growth, about 50% in total,
1713800	1715800	is there in Asia.
1715800	1719800	And the developed world is pretty flat.
1719800	1723800	And where are we going to get that if we don't change our policies?
1723800	1727800	Most of it is going to continue to come from fossil fuels,
1727800	1731800	even though renewables may grow strongly.
1733800	1737800	Fossil fuels continue to dominate.
1737800	1742800	This shows where the world got its energy from different sources,
1742800	1746800	from 1965 up until the present.
1746800	1751800	And you can see that the great bulk of the world's energy
1751800	1756800	comes from the bottom segments, oil, coal, and gas.
1756800	1762800	The others growing a little bit, but not a tremendously rapid amount.
1762800	1767800	The world has spent about $4 trillion over the last decade
1767800	1771800	trying to change the energy mix.
1771800	1777800	But fossil fuels still amount to just about 80% of the world's energy.
1779800	1783800	And that means that there are going to be increased emissions
1783800	1788800	from the developing world, whatever we do in the OECD.
1788800	1792800	You can see right now emissions are just about half and half
1792800	1797800	the vertical line 2020, but as we go out to mid-century,
1797800	1800800	the developing world dominates.
1800800	1804800	That's because fossil fuels are in fact the most reliable
1804800	1809800	and convenient way for those countries to get the energy that they need.
1811800	1816800	There's a guy, political scientist, economist named Anthony Downs,
1816800	1819800	who died about two years ago.
1819800	1824800	He wound up working at Brookings, but for the early part of his career
1824800	1827800	in the 60s, he was working at UCLA,
1827800	1831800	watching the smog get worse and worse
1831800	1836800	as more and more people were able to acquire automobiles.
1836800	1840800	And he wrote a wonderful paper called Up and Down with Ecology.
1840800	1843800	In 1972, I would highly recommend it.
1843800	1847800	What he said there is that the elite's environmental deterioration
1847800	1853800	is often the common man's improved standard of living.
1853800	1857800	And so we in the developed world might clutch our pearls
1857800	1863800	and recoil with horror at the threat of human-induced climate change.
1863800	1868800	The folks in the developing world have much bigger problems,
1868800	1872800	more immediate problems, and more readily soluble.
1872800	1877800	And so when we say the science compels us to make emissions reductions,
1877800	1880800	they say, what do you mean us?
1880800	1886800	Well, you have PM Modi in India saying the colonial mindset hasn't gone,
1886800	1892800	the developing nations are closing to us the path that made them developed.
1892800	1898800	And the ex-president of Niger, who was just opposed in a coup,
1898800	1901800	said about a year ago,
1901800	1904800	Africa's being punished by decisions of Western countries
1904800	1909800	to end public financing for foreign fossil fuel projects by the end of 2022.
1909800	1916800	You see this when the IMF or the World Bank refused to fund fossil fuel projects.
1916800	1918800	We're going to continue to fight.
1918800	1921800	We have fossil fuels that should be exploited.
1921800	1923800	So there is a moral issue.
1923800	1927800	For those of us who are sitting fat and happy in the developed world,
1927800	1930800	what are we going to tell these folks?
1930800	1937800	Nobody's got a good answer, as I've gone around and asked that question.
1937800	1942800	Finally, let me turn a little bit to rapid national decarbonization.
1942800	1948800	You say, well, okay, the US, EU should lead the way and reduce our emissions.
1948800	1950800	Well, it's not so simple.
1950800	1954800	Because to borrow a phrase from a movie recently,
1954800	1958800	energy touches everything everywhere all the time.
1958800	1963800	It is one of the fundamental systems of society.
1963800	1969800	Energy systems evolve very slowly because they need to be reliable
1969800	1972800	and the assets last a long time.
1972800	1977800	Power plants, refineries, automobiles, etc.
1977800	1982800	So you tinker with the energy system at your peril.
1982800	1987800	If you try to make the energy system change too rapidly,
1987800	1992800	it is going to be, it will be, extraordinarily disruptive.
1992800	1997800	The cost and reliability of energy services.
1997800	2003800	California here has very close to the highest electricity rates in the country
2003800	2010800	because of the strong dependence on solar and wind.
2010800	2013800	We're going to change the way people are employed.
2013800	2019800	You put in electric cars, mechanics will disappear, the flow of funds,
2019800	2024800	you lose the fuel tax, what are you going to do to replace that?
2024800	2030800	Financing an electric car, as an example, costs a lot more upfront
2030800	2035800	but has lower operating costs, at least until the government starts taxing it
2035800	2039800	to recover the lost fuel revenues.
2039800	2042800	Domestic manufacturing costs increase.
2042800	2047800	If you make energy expensive, manufacturing gets expensive.
2047800	2051800	Germany, which has the highest energy costs almost in the world,
2051800	2055800	is seeing an outflux of manufacturing
2055800	2060800	as the manufacturers de-camp for cheaper energy costs elsewhere.
2060800	2065800	You deploy immature technologies, you're going to have to replace them.
2065800	2068800	Wind is not quite up to snuff yet
2068800	2072800	and so we're seeing a lot of wind turbines having to get replaced
2072800	2075800	before their projected end of life.
2075800	2078800	Thirty years it's turning out to be more like 15
2078800	2082800	because we haven't taken the time to mature the technologies.
2082800	2084800	We need new supply chains.
2084800	2089800	A major part of the energy transition is going to be technologies
2089800	2093800	that employ exotic materials, relatively exotic.
2093800	2098800	Lithium, more copper, cobalt manganese rare earths
2098800	2104800	because renewable energies have to harvest energy
2104800	2109800	over very large areas and they need to be very efficient at harvesting it
2109800	2113800	so you need fancy magnets and conductors and so on.
2113800	2116800	So you've got to rejigger the supply chains
2116800	2122800	and right now China has got a market on the processing of these exotic materials
2122800	2128800	and that's causing grief, if you like, in the energy transition.
2128800	2130800	How much is it going to cost?
2130800	2133800	Well, it's hard to estimate but people try.
2133800	2139800	A number of estimates show that to go net zero by 2050
2139800	2147800	in the U.S. is going to cost somewhere between 5 and 7% of GDP each year.
2147800	2151800	That's one and a half trillion dollars a year.
2151800	2154800	We could do a lot with one and a half trillion dollars
2154800	2156800	besides trying to reduce our emissions
2156800	2160800	when the U.S. is only 13% of global emissions anyway
2160800	2165800	and the rest of the developing world is going up rather than going down.
2165800	2168800	Globally the numbers are about the same.
2168800	2172800	So we should be thinking hard before we commit to investing
2172800	2176800	one and a half trillion a year to go net zero
2176800	2183800	and we're already starting to see pushback on these overly stringent regulations
2183800	2187800	that are aimed at decarbonizing the economy.
2187800	2193800	In Europe we probably are seeing what people call peak green.
2193800	2197800	There's been pushback in Germany, in France and the U.K. and Netherlands
2197800	2200800	about how you heat your homes,
2200800	2205800	whether you can ban an internal combustion engine by 2035 and so on.
2205800	2208800	And there are political shifts that are underway
2208800	2213800	as a result of people, consumers, being unhappy about these.
2213800	2218800	The mandates in the U.S. are just beginning to affect everyday consumers
2218800	2221800	and I think we will see similar pushback.
2221800	2225800	People will start asking, tell me again why we're doing all of this,
2225800	2230800	as electricity costs go up, as electric vehicles cost more
2230800	2233800	than internal combustion engines and so on.
2233800	2240800	All right, so I've given you a lot of things that are somewhat on the cup is half empty side.
2240800	2243800	What do I think we should do?
2243800	2246800	I think the first thing we've got to do is cancel the climate crisis.
2246800	2249800	You know, when the U.N. Secretary General stands up and says
2249800	2253800	we're on the highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator,
2253800	2259800	that's just flat wrong and it is counterproductive.
2259800	2262800	At the same time, I think we need to acknowledge the task
2262800	2267800	and the challenges in trying to reduce human influences on the climate.
2267800	2271800	We need to have better and more transparent representations
2271800	2277800	of the scientific knowns and unknowns and the technology potentials to non-experts.
2277800	2281800	And more generally, I think the public and the decision makers,
2281800	2286800	including policy makers, have to become more literate about energy and climate.
2286800	2291800	We need to work harder on the science, observations, understanding.
2291800	2295800	We must not constrain the developing world's energy supply.
2295800	2300800	If we in the West, U.S., E.U. try to do that,
2300800	2304800	China is going to step in and make sure that they get the energy
2304800	2307800	and that's not a good thing geopolitically.
2307800	2311800	We need a greater focus on adaptation and resilience.
2311800	2316800	If we can't reduce emissions sufficiently rapidly
2316800	2319800	and I think there are many reasons why we can't,
2319800	2324800	we need to understand how to better adapt to a changing climate.
2324800	2328800	One of the things we don't do is to prepare for the past.
2328800	2333800	The terrible tragedy we've seen in the last week or so in Maui
2333800	2338800	was anticipated by many more than a decade ago
2338800	2342800	and there are reports that say you should do X, Y and Z
2342800	2346800	and of course nobody did most of them.
2346800	2349800	And of course for the developing countries,
2349800	2352800	we need to make sure that they improve their lot
2352800	2355800	so that they can be more resilient.
2355800	2357800	Technology is really important.
2357800	2361800	We've got to make technologies that are low or zero emissions
2361800	2365800	about as cheap as fossil fuels.
2365800	2367800	I have my own favorite list there.
2367800	2369800	I won't go through in any detail.
2369800	2373800	And then finally, I think graceful decarbonization.
2373800	2377800	Right now governments are just throwing stuff at the wall
2377800	2379800	and trying to see what sticks.
2379800	2382800	So you've got, for example, in the US IRA,
2382800	2387800	I think totally unjustified subsidies for wind and solar
2387800	2392800	when they cannot be the primary source of electricity in the country.
2392800	2395800	So we need to figure out these pathways,
2395800	2400800	involves technology, business, regulation, behavior.
2400800	2402800	Nobody has done that.
2402800	2407800	We're just all running around saying this guy is falling.
2407800	2409800	Last chart.
2409800	2412800	I thought it would be good to just offer a couple of thoughts
2412800	2416800	on S&T input to policy more generally,
2416800	2420800	not just climate and energy,
2420800	2424800	but pandemics, for example.
2424800	2429800	Other S&T matters, artificial intelligence.
2429800	2431800	For those of you who are not experts,
2431800	2435800	as most of you aren't, as I read your bios in S&T matters,
2435800	2438800	don't be afraid to ask dumb questions.
2438800	2444800	Sometimes they can elucidate or reveal gaps in our understanding
2444800	2449800	or things that the advisors are not telling you about.
2449800	2454800	Ask about the data, coverage, bias, uncertainties.
2454800	2456800	We saw that in COVID.
2456800	2458800	Ask about model protections.
2458800	2460800	How do you know the models are right?
2460800	2463800	What's the range of models that you get,
2463800	2469800	for example, for the spread of COVID-19 or for climate?
2469800	2473800	Do not rely on the media for S&T input in these policy matters.
2473800	2477800	They get it completely wrong.
2477800	2480800	It's like shooting fish in a barrel to write op-eds
2480800	2483800	that pick out one another media story
2483800	2488800	and confront it with the real data in climate and energy.
2488800	2491800	Get yourself out of the echo chamber.
2491800	2495800	Look for diverse perspectives among the scientists and engineers
2495800	2498800	and welcome bad news.
2498800	2501800	If everybody tells you the same thing you want to hear,
2501800	2504800	that's not very good at all.
2504800	2507800	Paul Simon wrote 60 years ago almost,
2507800	2510800	man, here's what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.
2510800	2515800	So look for that diversity of perspective opinion.
2515800	2520800	And finally, don't misrepresent the science to justify a decision.
2520800	2525800	Make that balance that I talked about at the beginning explicit.
2525800	2529800	Yes, on the one hand, on the other hand, and so on.
2529800	2532800	Having been a scientist most of my life
2532800	2535800	and only gotten involved in policy matters,
2535800	2538800	I would say in the last 20 years,
2538800	2543800	I at one point heard the phrase science-informed policy.
2543800	2546800	And I thought when I heard it, well, of course,
2546800	2549800	what other kind of policy is there?
2549800	2553800	And then I discovered that you often see in climate issues
2553800	2556800	policy-informed science,
2556800	2559800	namely that the description of the science
2559800	2564800	is meant to conform to what policy makers would like to have happen.
2564800	2567800	So I leave you with those general thoughts
2567800	2571800	and welcome any comments or questions that you might have.
