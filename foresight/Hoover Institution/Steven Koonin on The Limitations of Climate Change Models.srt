1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
OK, since this is a policy-oriented gathering,

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,320
I thought the best thing I could do as a scientist

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,640
was to lay out some of the factual context for climate

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,680
and the closely related subject of energy.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,320
So if you listen to most of the political dialogue

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,560
and certainly the media, what you hear

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,000
is that climate science compels us

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,480
to make large and rapid reductions in greenhouse gas

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,680
emissions, take climate action immediately

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,680
and on a large scale.

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,080
And that is driven by the fact that global greenhouse gas

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:56,640
emissions have been rising at about 1.5% a year.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,800
The UN says that we need to get to net zero emissions

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,720
by 30 years from now in order to, quote,

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,520
avoid the worst effects of climate change.

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:17,520
And they have various trajectories of emissions going forward.

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,120
Do I have a pointer, by the way?

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,000
I guess not.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,640
As you can see there, emissions would

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,480
have to go to zero by 2050 or so if we

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,120
are to keep the global temperature

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,480
rise to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial.

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,200
You think about policy required to implement something

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,640
like that, and they have to strike a balance.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,480
On the one side, we've got the certainties and uncertainties

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,040
of climate science, and I was amused

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,520
to hear during the banking talk yesterday

28
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,360
the reverence with which physics and chemistry are

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,800
treated in terms of the precision and certainty

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,840
of their understanding.

31
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,320
It's very much not the case.

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,080
And the hazards and the risks of a changing climate.

33
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,960
And on the other side, as we'll see the world's growing demand

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,880
for reliable, affordable, and clean energy.

35
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:22,440
Striking that balance is about policy.

36
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,280
You have to fold in values and priorities, environment

37
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,440
versus development, tolerance for risk, equity

38
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,560
across North-South and across generations,

39
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,800
and really do any of the responses

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,000
that you might make in policy, make a difference,

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,560
and how much will they cost.

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,400
And of course, it's in the center box

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,560
that I expect most of you are interested and focused.

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,160
So I want to take you through some

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,280
of the considerations involved in striking that balance

46
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,480
in the form of three high-level statements.

47
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,840
The first is that the notion of a climate crisis, which

48
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,760
you hear so often, has scant scientific support.

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,720
The climate today is not broken, and fears of future catastrophes

50
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,760
depend on extreme emission scenarios that

51
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,320
are fed into models that are entirely unsuited to the task.

52
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,760
And so if we act too rapidly and in an ill-thought-through way,

53
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,080
we will incur a greater threat to human well-being

54
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,720
than climate change itself.

55
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,400
And of course, I'm going to show you data and trends that

56
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,760
support these statements.

57
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,400
The second is that if you advocate for rapid or overly

58
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,640
rapid global decarbonization, you've

59
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,560
got a moral issue, which I will try to elucidate.

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,880
And the third is if you try to decarbonize too rapidly

61
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,760
at the national level, it's going

62
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,440
to be disruptive, expensive, and will ultimately

63
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,120
degrade national security.

64
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,080
Let me start with a definition first.

65
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,040
Weather is not climate.

66
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,720
Climate is the long-term average, typically 30 years,

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,360
of the properties of weather.

68
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,640
And that's nicely illustrated by this chart, which

69
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,280
shows about a 900-year-long record

70
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,680
of the annual height of the Nile River measured

71
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,280
during the summer minimum in Cairo.

72
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,600
The Egyptians, of course, cared a lot

73
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,520
about the height of the Nile, as did the people who

74
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,760
were ruling Egypt in any given time.

75
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,960
And what you see when you look at this graph,

76
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,800
the blue values are the annual values,

77
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,360
is that there's a lot of up and down from year to year.

78
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,200
One year, it could be up at almost 6 meters,

79
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:08,000
and the next year or so, it's down at 2 meters or 1 meter.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,840
So that's whether it happens year to year.

81
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,600
The second is if you look at the 30-year average, which

82
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:25,240
is the red line, you can see that it also goes up and down a lot.

83
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,840
And if you were alive during the first 150 years of this record,

84
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,920
you would see the annual minimum going down and down.

85
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,600
And no doubt, some medieval Egyptian climate panel

86
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,320
would be screaming new normal, new normal,

87
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,960
and recommending prayers and sacrifice.

88
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,160
In fact, the climate varies a lot on its own.

89
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,360
Human influences were entirely absent during this time.

90
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,240
And if they had just waited a couple of hundred years

91
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,160
after 700, you see it comes back up quite a lot.

92
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,560
So you can get fooled a lot by year to year variability

93
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,200
or by variability over decades.

94
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,400
And untangling the response to human influences

95
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,040
from this natural variability of the climate system

96
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,120
is something that is a major challenge in the science

97
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,720
these days.

98
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,200
We do it a lot in the media.

99
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,400
The media entirely misrepresent the science.

100
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,120
Here's a little vignette.

101
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,520
NASA press release in March of 2020.

102
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,880
The Guardian used newspaper in the UK in December 2019.

103
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,720
Headline, Greenland's ice sheet is melting seven times faster

104
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,240
than in the 1990s.

105
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,720
And if you look in the text of the article,

106
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,800
the rate of ice loss has risen from 33 billion tons a year

107
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,120
in the 90s to 254 billion tons a year in the past decade.

108
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,360
That's a true statement.

109
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,000
But if you look at it in context,

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,160
it carries a very different message.

111
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,480
Here's the actual data compiled by the Danish

112
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,880
Meteorological Institute.

113
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,320
This is how much Greenland lost in ice year by year

114
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,360
averaged over 10 years.

115
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,160
And you can see that from 1990 to 2012 or so,

116
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,760
it did go up a lot.

117
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,080
It's a lot of part of this graph.

118
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,000
But if you look at the past almost 100 years,

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,760
it went up and down a lot.

120
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,080
And if you go back to 1930, when human influences were much

121
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,920
smaller than they are today, about one-fifth,

122
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,200
you can see that it was losing ice almost as much.

123
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:59,080
And even as the globe warmed from 1930 up to 2022,

124
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,800
the ice loss went up and down.

125
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,400
In fact, it's currently declining rather than going up.

126
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,120
So this is not global warming.

127
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,720
This is weather.

128
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,640
Turns out to be weather in the North Atlantic.

129
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,680
So it's impossible to talk about weather

130
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,400
without talking about the unusual heat

131
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,600
that we have seen this summer.

132
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,040
Here is context.

133
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,840
This is data from the US EPA, official government data.

134
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,120
It's the Heat Wave Index.

135
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,680
We can talk about how you define heat waves, but not now.

136
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,320
And you can see that in the last 40 years or so from 1980,

137
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,800
not much changed.

138
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,880
This does not include the last summer, of course.

139
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,400
We don't have that data yet.

140
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,160
But even so, one year is not going

141
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,040
to make all that much difference in a climate sense.

142
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,200
And it was a lot more active in terms of heat waves

143
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,440
in the 1930s than it is now.

144
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,400
Again, human influence is much smaller.

145
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,440
This is the satellite-derived record

146
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,240
of the global temperature, temperature of the lower

147
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,120
atmosphere, month by month.

148
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,920
And the last point in that graph is July 2023, last month.

149
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,760
And you can see, wow, big spike, right?

150
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,800
But when you look at it, you see other big spikes, mostly

151
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,240
due to El Ninos.

152
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,120
And you can see that there's a gradual long-term trend.

153
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,560
So however much the media and other folks

154
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,920
make of the unusually hot July that we have had,

155
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,280
that's not human influences.

156
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,720
It's weather.

157
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,800
The long-term trend in this data may well be human influences,

158
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,440
but they can't resist capitalizing on dramatic weather

159
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,000
events to make the point.

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,680
There it is.

161
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,320
What are the causes?

162
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,480
Maybe greenhouse gases, but that seems unlikely again,

163
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,880
because greenhouse gases act over long-time periods

164
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,480
smoothly.

165
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,080
El Nino, we are in the beginnings of another El Nino cycle.

166
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,960
There are other oscillations in the climate system

167
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,400
that are conspiring to work together.

168
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,880
Stratospheric water vapor is another explanation.

169
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,360
You may not know that in January of last year,

170
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,400
there was an enormous underwater volcanic eruption

171
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,080
that increased the water vapor in the upper atmosphere

172
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,480
by 10% to 13%.

173
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,640
You can see it here in this graph.

174
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,040
That big, dark blob at the end of the graph the most recent

175
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,080
years is the water vapor from this underground eruption,

176
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,480
undersea eruption.

177
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,480
And that increases the heat trapping of the atmosphere.

178
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,880
And then finally, we've been cleaning up

179
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,880
the lower atmosphere from coal emissions

180
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,840
and from ship emissions that allows the Earth

181
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,720
to absorb a little more sunlight.

182
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,920
And that's also playing a role in the recent warming.

183
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,120
Finally, urban heat island.

184
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,240
You hear a lot about records being broken.

185
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,840
Phoenix, Houston, and so on.

186
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,400
The temperature in the cities is hotter than the surroundings,

187
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,000
as much as five or six degrees.

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,960
And if you've got a weather station that's

189
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,120
in the middle of a city that's growing and growing and growing,

190
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,360
the heating of the city starts to affect whether you're

191
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,040
going to break a record or not.

192
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,400
Temperature is not the only thing

193
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,840
that is a manifestation of climate.

194
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,640
Of much greater concern are extreme weather events

195
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,400
and sea level rise.

196
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,800
This is a chart from the most recent UN report issued

197
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,760
about a year ago.

198
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,640
And the colors indicate whether a trend has been observed

199
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,320
or not in various phenomena.

200
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,960
The ones associated with heat and cold, well, yeah,

201
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,640
we've got more heat.

202
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,480
More heat waves globally, though not in the US,

203
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,280
less fewer cold spells.

204
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,960
But then there's a whole category of wet and dry

205
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,320
for which there is no trend.

206
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,800
There's a whole category of wind,

207
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,520
including tropical cyclones, hurricanes, typhoons,

208
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,760
again, for which there is no trend, et cetera.

209
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,600
So in fact, for most of the extreme weather events,

210
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,200
we have not seen trends over the last century.

211
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,520
Here's some of the text that goes along with it.

212
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,240
Low confidence in most reported long-term trends in hurricanes.

213
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,840
Low confidence in mid-latitude storms.

214
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,520
Tornadoes hail lightning, no trends, et cetera, et cetera.

215
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,960
The one in which there is confidence

216
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,640
is that we have seen some increase in heavy precipitation

217
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,000
on a global scale over land.

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,880
We can go on and on again.

219
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,680
Not a lot that gives us support

220
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,560
that there is a climate crisis underway.

221
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,000
Here's some of the data for hurricanes.

222
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,840
This is the record of the number of hurricanes globally.

223
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,080
Upper trace is all tropical storms.

224
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,560
Lower trace are hurricanes.

225
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,080
And this is a record that extends over 50-some-odd years.

226
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,720
It's hard to see any change at all.

227
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,800
This is a measure of hurricane activity.

228
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,640
It waits the strongest storms more than the weaker storms.

229
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,080
Again, globally in the top, northern hemisphere in the bottom,

230
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,360
lots of ups and downs over 50 years,

231
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,480
but it's hard to find any effect.

232
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,960
And in fact, the official reports say we can't find any trends.

233
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,880
I'm not going to go through the language,

234
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,640
but that's what it says.

235
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,640
By the way, I don't know if you'll have access

236
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,680
to the charts, but they have links to all of the supporting

237
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,880
either UN reports or quality peer-reviewed literature

238
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,400
in each of the statements.

239
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,200
So that's the climate of today and the past.

240
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,960
You might ask, what about the future?

241
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,400
Well, for that, we rely on models.

242
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,800
And one of the major measures of a model

243
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,800
is how sensitive is it to increasing the carbon dioxide?

244
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,600
If you doubled the carbon dioxide in the model,

245
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,680
by how much would the temperature go up?

246
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,200
And that's shown in this graph.

247
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,640
There are about 40 different models listed there.

248
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,800
They're produced by institutes and universities

249
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,600
around the world.

250
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,480
And what's parted is how sensitive the model is.

251
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,480
And the ones in yellow, about 40% of them,

252
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,440
were deemed too sensitive by the UN,

253
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,960
and so are not used at all.

254
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,760
That's a little bit scary.

255
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,000
The world's best models making their best tries

256
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,520
get it wrong 40% of the time.

257
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,520
It's even worse when you ask, how well do the models produce

258
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,400
the temperature history that we've seen?

259
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,440
And that's shown on these graphs.

260
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,880
The black is the actual observed temperature

261
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,280
rise of the globe, and the different traces

262
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,560
are the different models.

263
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,120
And you can see that many of the models

264
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,960
differ from the data or they differ from themselves

265
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,040
by more than the temperature rise

266
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,440
that they're trying to describe.

267
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,360
And in fact, even the climate models

268
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,840
don't believe their own models, at least

269
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
at the regional level.

270
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,480
Tim Palmer at Oxford and Bjorn Stevens,

271
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,840
who is the director of the Max Planck Institute

272
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,920
for Meteorology, says, for many key applications,

273
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,080
the current generation of models is not fit for purpose.

274
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,680
There's Bjorn, he gave a lecture at UCLA about a year ago,

275
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,840
and he says, it's difficult in many places

276
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,920
impossible to scientifically advise societal efforts

277
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,200
to adapt in the face of unavoidable warming.

278
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,040
We can't assess the extent to which a given degree of warming

279
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,640
poses an existential threat.

280
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:34,080
And there's Tim Palmer in an email not publicly published,

281
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,640
but broadly published in the National Academy membership.

282
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,080
He says, our understanding of climate change,

283
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,560
especially at the regional scale, is rather poor.

284
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,760
How can a country adapt if it doesn't even

285
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,560
know the sign of precipitation change

286
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,240
as the IPCC figures show?

287
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,880
And he says, the policy and decision

288
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,680
make us start to feel uncomfortable when we say that.

289
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,920
They'd rather we didn't say such things in public.

290
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,480
They claim it undermines the public's faith

291
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,200
in the need to take action.

292
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:13,520
And I think this is a disease, a dysfunction of the science

293
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,280
in this particular field.

294
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,400
As a scientist, I think it's our duty

295
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,600
to lay out the science, knowns and unknowns,

296
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,400
transparently, completely, and without bias.

297
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,440
That's not happening.

298
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,160
I can tell you, show you specific examples.

299
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,800
All right, let's look at just one or two more model projections.

300
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,240
Sea level.

301
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,840
I live most of the time in Manhattan in New York City.

302
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,240
There's been a tide gauge at the foot of Manhattan

303
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,840
the southern tip for 150 years, maybe a little more.

304
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,120
This is the rate of rise of the sea

305
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,280
at the tip of Manhattan since 1920.

306
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,600
It averages about three millimeters a year, you can see.

307
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,200
But it goes up and down.

308
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,120
Three millimeters a year, by the way, is a foot a century.

309
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,560
NOAA, the part of the US government

310
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,120
concerned with oceans and atmospheres,

311
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,520
says that over the next 30 years,

312
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,680
this graph is going to do that.

313
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,920
Remarkable.

314
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,560
Who am I to challenge NOAA?

315
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,880
But we'll know soon enough whether that's going to happen or not.

316
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,840
And in fact, other researchers say,

317
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,920
you shouldn't be using these models

318
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,160
because they're not very precise.

319
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,040
They're not very accurate and so on.

320
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,160
Giving an impression of false confidence to users.

321
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,680
Well, if you can't believe the models

322
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,360
about what's going to happen going forward,

323
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,920
how might we get a handle on how things are going to change

324
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,360
as the globe warms?

325
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,400
Well, we can look at the past.

326
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,160
So here's the global average temperature since 1850.

327
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:07,600
And you can see that since 1900 or so,

328
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,440
it's gone up by about 1.3 degrees to the present.

329
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,840
That's just about the same amount of warming

330
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,800
that the UN predicts on average to the end of the century, 2100.

331
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,600
What will be the impacts?

332
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,600
Well, we don't know, but we can see how the globe has fared

333
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,160
during the previous 120 years.

334
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,400
And the answer is humanity has prospered as never before.

335
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,240
The global temperature went up by 1.3 degrees.

336
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,920
The population went up by a factor of 5.

337
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:52,960
Life expectancy went from 32 years to almost 73 years.

338
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,760
The literacy fraction jumped by a factor of 4.

339
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,400
GDP per capita went up by a factor of 7, et cetera, et cetera.

340
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,720
And the death rate from extreme weather

341
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,800
went down by a factor of 50, even as the globe

342
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,120
warmed 1.3 degrees.

343
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,840
That doesn't say things are going

344
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,080
to be perfect over the next 80 years,

345
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,880
but it sure gives some sense that humanity is perfectly

346
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:28,480
capable of adapting and flourishing as conditions change.

347
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,040
Here's one example of that, agriculture.

348
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,160
This is 60 years' worth of agricultural data globally.

349
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,080
The land area used for grain production

350
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,120
hasn't gone up at all, shown by the lower trace.

351
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,320
But the population, of course, has gone up.

352
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,240
The grain yield, which is how many bushels per acre you get,

353
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,560
or tons per acre, or whatever, has gone up spectacularly

354
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,080
as agronomy has gotten better.

355
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,800
And the grain production, how much grain

356
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,400
the world actually produces, has also gone up by 250%,

357
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,680
even as the globe warmed up.

358
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,840
If you look at weather losses, how much GDP

359
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,440
did you spend because of extreme weather events?

360
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,560
This is global data.

361
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,520
You can see, first of all, that it

362
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,520
hovers around a quarter of a percent of GDP.

363
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,360
Second, you can see it's actually gone down a little bit.

364
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,240
Again, people who are concerned will say, well,

365
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,040
this is just going to go up and up.

366
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,000
But in fact, as the world develops,

367
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,600
we get more and more resilient and able to deal

368
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,360
with extreme weather events.

369
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,000
And in any event, right now, it's only a quarter

370
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,920
percent of GDP globally.

371
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,480
What about the economic impacts?

372
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,640
Well, last March, about four months ago,

373
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,320
the White House put out a white paper

374
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,800
that summarized the result of 12 independent peer-reviewed

375
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:13,000
studies of how much warming would affect the US GDP.

376
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,600
This graph comes from that report.

377
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,560
And what you can see is that as the change

378
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,400
in global surface temperature, it's

379
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,640
in degrees Fahrenheit because this is a US graph.

380
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,080
But OK.

381
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,000
We're currently at that vertical line.

382
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,680
And you can see that it's expected

383
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,120
that warming has affected the US GDP.

384
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,000
Those different lines indicate different models.

385
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,920
The black line is the average.

386
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,200
You can see it's down at less than a tenth of a percent.

387
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,960
And that if we go out to the extreme end of this chart,

388
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,520
which is where we would be under the Paris 2 degree warming,

389
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,400
you can see it's still at 2%.

390
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,200
In other words, the economy would be 2% smaller in 2100,

391
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,440
let's say, than it would have been otherwise.

392
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,760
It's in the noise.

393
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,280
Bjorn Lomborg and another paper compiled

394
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:17,200
a similar set of estimates for the globe as a whole.

395
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,320
And again, the takeaway is a few percent for a few degrees.

396
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,600
Well, you might say, well, what about tipping points?

397
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,040
And of course, people have studied that as well.

398
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
There's a paper.

399
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,000
It's another 1% or 2% for the tipping points.

400
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,880
And so economically, this is in the noise.

401
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,880
Now, you might argue GDP is not the only thing that matters.

402
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,680
There will be differential impacts, poor people versus rich people,

403
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:53,440
et cetera, all true, but hardly a catastrophe or existential threat.

404
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,760
OK, let me turn to the second statement I wanted to make,

405
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:02,600
and that advocacy for rapid decarbonization globally is immoral.

406
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,280
And it starts with demographics.

407
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,800
This is the global population historically

408
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,400
and projected out to 2100.

409
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,920
And you can see we've just crossed 8 billion people right now.

410
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,560
And according to this projection, we'll get to 10 billion

411
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,240
by the end of the century.

412
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,600
Most of the growth between now and the end of the century

413
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,280
is in Asia and in Africa.

414
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,800
That means that the developed world, where there are one and a half billion

415
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,680
of us, is getting older.

416
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,040
The developing world is younger.

417
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,400
And urbanization is proceeding at a spectacular pace.

418
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,600
50 million people a year.

419
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,560
The equivalent to six New York cities a year are getting created.

420
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,560
Half of the world now is urbanized.

421
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,600
70% will be by the end of the century.

422
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,960
Steve Haber yesterday talked about the developed world bubble

423
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,000
we're sort of living in, I would say almost echo chamber.

424
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
This graph makes it rather apparent.

425
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,400
What's plotted here is for a number of representative countries

426
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,800
indicated on the right.

427
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:25,800
The annual energy consumption per capita.

428
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
How much energy did it get?

429
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,800
The annual energy consumption per capita.

430
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,800
How much energy did each person use?

431
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Parted as a function of the GDP per capita in constant 2017 dollars.

432
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,800
And you can see that there are lots of interesting things

433
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,800
to understand about this chart.

434
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:55,800
Some of us in the US, Canada, some other very developed countries,

435
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,800
we sit in the upper right corner.

436
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,800
We have a relatively high GDP as a result.

437
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,800
In the middle of the graph you find the European countries

438
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,800
and a number of other middle countries

439
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,800
that use about half the energy per capita of the US

440
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,800
and have a somewhat smaller GDP.

441
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,800
And down on the lower left corner you see a set of countries

442
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,800
whose energy use increases universally

443
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,800
and monotonically as they get richer.

444
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Richer countries use more energy

445
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,800
and when you're a developing country down on the lower left

446
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:39,800
your energy use is going to go up a lot as you become better off.

447
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,800
What is sobering about this chart

448
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,800
is that there are only one and a half billion people

449
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,800
in the upper parts of this chart.

450
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,800
If you go down to the bottom left you've got about six billion people.

451
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,800
And so it's pretty clear that as they improve their standard of living

452
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:02,800
by using more energy, the energy demand is going to go up.

453
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,800
People down there, maybe some of you come from those countries

454
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,800
that have been in them, life without energy is no fun.

455
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,800
It means cooking and heating with what's politely called

456
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,800
traditional biomass or wood and dung.

457
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,800
The indoor air pollution from that is terrible,

458
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,800
kills two million people a year.

459
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:35,800
Without 24-hour lighting, you've got to study under extreme conditions.

460
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,800
It's okay to eat romantically by candlelight,

461
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,800
but studying by candlelight is no fun.

462
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,800
The inequalities are astounding.

463
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Nigeria consumes one-thirtieth the energy per capita that we do in the U.S.

464
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,800
And there are three billion people in the world,

465
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
three-eighths of the population,

466
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,800
that use less electricity per year than the average U.S. refrigerator.

467
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,800
And I will say with a little bit of embarrassment,

468
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,800
I have three refrigerators in my house in New York.

469
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,800
So if you combine the demographics of population growth

470
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,800
with the need for energy as you develop,

471
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,800
you get a strong growth in energy consumption.

472
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,800
This is shown projected out to 2050.

473
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Again, you can see most of the growth, about 50% in total,

474
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
is there in Asia.

475
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,800
And the developed world is pretty flat.

476
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,800
And where are we going to get that if we don't change our policies?

477
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Most of it is going to continue to come from fossil fuels,

478
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,800
even though renewables may grow strongly.

479
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Fossil fuels continue to dominate.

480
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,800
This shows where the world got its energy from different sources,

481
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,800
from 1965 up until the present.

482
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,800
And you can see that the great bulk of the world's energy

483
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,800
comes from the bottom segments, oil, coal, and gas.

484
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:22,800
The others growing a little bit, but not a tremendously rapid amount.

485
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,800
The world has spent about $4 trillion over the last decade

486
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,800
trying to change the energy mix.

487
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:37,800
But fossil fuels still amount to just about 80% of the world's energy.

488
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,800
And that means that there are going to be increased emissions

489
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,800
from the developing world, whatever we do in the OECD.

490
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,800
You can see right now emissions are just about half and half

491
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,800
the vertical line 2020, but as we go out to mid-century,

492
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,800
the developing world dominates.

493
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,800
That's because fossil fuels are in fact the most reliable

494
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,800
and convenient way for those countries to get the energy that they need.

495
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,800
There's a guy, political scientist, economist named Anthony Downs,

496
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,800
who died about two years ago.

497
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,800
He wound up working at Brookings, but for the early part of his career

498
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,800
in the 60s, he was working at UCLA,

499
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,800
watching the smog get worse and worse

500
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,800
as more and more people were able to acquire automobiles.

501
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,800
And he wrote a wonderful paper called Up and Down with Ecology.

502
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,800
In 1972, I would highly recommend it.

503
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,800
What he said there is that the elite's environmental deterioration

504
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:53,800
is often the common man's improved standard of living.

505
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,800
And so we in the developed world might clutch our pearls

506
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:03,800
and recoil with horror at the threat of human-induced climate change.

507
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,800
The folks in the developing world have much bigger problems,

508
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,800
more immediate problems, and more readily soluble.

509
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,800
And so when we say the science compels us to make emissions reductions,

510
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,800
they say, what do you mean us?

511
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:26,800
Well, you have PM Modi in India saying the colonial mindset hasn't gone,

512
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:32,800
the developing nations are closing to us the path that made them developed.

513
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:38,800
And the ex-president of Niger, who was just opposed in a coup,

514
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,800
said about a year ago,

515
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Africa's being punished by decisions of Western countries

516
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,800
to end public financing for foreign fossil fuel projects by the end of 2022.

517
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:56,800
You see this when the IMF or the World Bank refused to fund fossil fuel projects.

518
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,800
We're going to continue to fight.

519
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,800
We have fossil fuels that should be exploited.

520
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
So there is a moral issue.

521
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,800
For those of us who are sitting fat and happy in the developed world,

522
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,800
what are we going to tell these folks?

523
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Nobody's got a good answer, as I've gone around and asked that question.

524
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,800
Finally, let me turn a little bit to rapid national decarbonization.

525
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:28,800
You say, well, okay, the US, EU should lead the way and reduce our emissions.

526
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Well, it's not so simple.

527
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,800
Because to borrow a phrase from a movie recently,

528
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,800
energy touches everything everywhere all the time.

529
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,800
It is one of the fundamental systems of society.

530
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Energy systems evolve very slowly because they need to be reliable

531
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,800
and the assets last a long time.

532
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Power plants, refineries, automobiles, etc.

533
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,800
So you tinker with the energy system at your peril.

534
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,800
If you try to make the energy system change too rapidly,

535
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:12,800
it is going to be, it will be, extraordinarily disruptive.

536
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,800
The cost and reliability of energy services.

537
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,800
California here has very close to the highest electricity rates in the country

538
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:30,800
because of the strong dependence on solar and wind.

539
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,800
We're going to change the way people are employed.

540
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:39,800
You put in electric cars, mechanics will disappear, the flow of funds,

541
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:44,800
you lose the fuel tax, what are you going to do to replace that?

542
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Financing an electric car, as an example, costs a lot more upfront

543
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,800
but has lower operating costs, at least until the government starts taxing it

544
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,800
to recover the lost fuel revenues.

545
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Domestic manufacturing costs increase.

546
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:07,800
If you make energy expensive, manufacturing gets expensive.

547
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Germany, which has the highest energy costs almost in the world,

548
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,800
is seeing an outflux of manufacturing

549
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,800
as the manufacturers de-camp for cheaper energy costs elsewhere.

550
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,800
You deploy immature technologies, you're going to have to replace them.

551
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,800
Wind is not quite up to snuff yet

552
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,800
and so we're seeing a lot of wind turbines having to get replaced

553
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,800
before their projected end of life.

554
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,800
Thirty years it's turning out to be more like 15

555
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,800
because we haven't taken the time to mature the technologies.

556
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,800
We need new supply chains.

557
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,800
A major part of the energy transition is going to be technologies

558
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,800
that employ exotic materials, relatively exotic.

559
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Lithium, more copper, cobalt manganese rare earths

560
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,800
because renewable energies have to harvest energy

561
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,800
over very large areas and they need to be very efficient at harvesting it

562
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,800
so you need fancy magnets and conductors and so on.

563
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,800
So you've got to rejigger the supply chains

564
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,800
and right now China has got a market on the processing of these exotic materials

565
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,800
and that's causing grief, if you like, in the energy transition.

566
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,800
How much is it going to cost?

567
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,800
Well, it's hard to estimate but people try.

568
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,800
A number of estimates show that to go net zero by 2050

569
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:47,800
in the U.S. is going to cost somewhere between 5 and 7% of GDP each year.

570
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,800
That's one and a half trillion dollars a year.

571
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,800
We could do a lot with one and a half trillion dollars

572
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
besides trying to reduce our emissions

573
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,800
when the U.S. is only 13% of global emissions anyway

574
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,800
and the rest of the developing world is going up rather than going down.

575
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Globally the numbers are about the same.

576
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,800
So we should be thinking hard before we commit to investing

577
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,800
one and a half trillion a year to go net zero

578
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,800
and we're already starting to see pushback on these overly stringent regulations

579
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,800
that are aimed at decarbonizing the economy.

580
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:33,800
In Europe we probably are seeing what people call peak green.

581
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,800
There's been pushback in Germany, in France and the U.K. and Netherlands

582
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,800
about how you heat your homes,

583
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,800
whether you can ban an internal combustion engine by 2035 and so on.

584
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,800
And there are political shifts that are underway

585
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,800
as a result of people, consumers, being unhappy about these.

586
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,800
The mandates in the U.S. are just beginning to affect everyday consumers

587
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,800
and I think we will see similar pushback.

588
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,800
People will start asking, tell me again why we're doing all of this,

589
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,800
as electricity costs go up, as electric vehicles cost more

590
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,800
than internal combustion engines and so on.

591
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,800
All right, so I've given you a lot of things that are somewhat on the cup is half empty side.

592
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,800
What do I think we should do?

593
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,800
I think the first thing we've got to do is cancel the climate crisis.

594
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,800
You know, when the U.N. Secretary General stands up and says

595
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,800
we're on the highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator,

596
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,800
that's just flat wrong and it is counterproductive.

597
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,800
At the same time, I think we need to acknowledge the task

598
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,800
and the challenges in trying to reduce human influences on the climate.

599
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,800
We need to have better and more transparent representations

600
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,800
of the scientific knowns and unknowns and the technology potentials to non-experts.

601
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,800
And more generally, I think the public and the decision makers,

602
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,800
including policy makers, have to become more literate about energy and climate.

603
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:11,800
We need to work harder on the science, observations, understanding.

604
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,800
We must not constrain the developing world's energy supply.

605
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,800
If we in the West, U.S., E.U. try to do that,

606
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,800
China is going to step in and make sure that they get the energy

607
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,800
and that's not a good thing geopolitically.

608
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,800
We need a greater focus on adaptation and resilience.

609
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,800
If we can't reduce emissions sufficiently rapidly

610
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,800
and I think there are many reasons why we can't,

611
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:44,800
we need to understand how to better adapt to a changing climate.

612
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,800
One of the things we don't do is to prepare for the past.

613
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,800
The terrible tragedy we've seen in the last week or so in Maui

614
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,800
was anticipated by many more than a decade ago

615
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,800
and there are reports that say you should do X, Y and Z

616
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,800
and of course nobody did most of them.

617
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,800
And of course for the developing countries,

618
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,800
we need to make sure that they improve their lot

619
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,800
so that they can be more resilient.

620
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,800
Technology is really important.

621
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,800
We've got to make technologies that are low or zero emissions

622
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,800
about as cheap as fossil fuels.

623
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
I have my own favorite list there.

624
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,800
I won't go through in any detail.

625
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,800
And then finally, I think graceful decarbonization.

626
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,800
Right now governments are just throwing stuff at the wall

627
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
and trying to see what sticks.

628
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,800
So you've got, for example, in the US IRA,

629
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,800
I think totally unjustified subsidies for wind and solar

630
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,800
when they cannot be the primary source of electricity in the country.

631
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,800
So we need to figure out these pathways,

632
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,800
involves technology, business, regulation, behavior.

633
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
Nobody has done that.

634
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,800
We're just all running around saying this guy is falling.

635
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,800
Last chart.

636
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,800
I thought it would be good to just offer a couple of thoughts

637
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,800
on S&T input to policy more generally,

638
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,800
not just climate and energy,

639
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,800
but pandemics, for example.

640
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,800
Other S&T matters, artificial intelligence.

641
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,800
For those of you who are not experts,

642
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,800
as most of you aren't, as I read your bios in S&T matters,

643
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,800
don't be afraid to ask dumb questions.

644
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,800
Sometimes they can elucidate or reveal gaps in our understanding

645
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,800
or things that the advisors are not telling you about.

646
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Ask about the data, coverage, bias, uncertainties.

647
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
We saw that in COVID.

648
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Ask about model protections.

649
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
How do you know the models are right?

650
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,800
What's the range of models that you get,

651
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:09,800
for example, for the spread of COVID-19 or for climate?

652
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,800
Do not rely on the media for S&T input in these policy matters.

653
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,800
They get it completely wrong.

654
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,800
It's like shooting fish in a barrel to write op-eds

655
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,800
that pick out one another media story

656
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:28,800
and confront it with the real data in climate and energy.

657
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,800
Get yourself out of the echo chamber.

658
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Look for diverse perspectives among the scientists and engineers

659
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,800
and welcome bad news.

660
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,800
If everybody tells you the same thing you want to hear,

661
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,800
that's not very good at all.

662
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,800
Paul Simon wrote 60 years ago almost,

663
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,800
man, here's what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.

664
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,800
So look for that diversity of perspective opinion.

665
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,800
And finally, don't misrepresent the science to justify a decision.

666
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,800
Make that balance that I talked about at the beginning explicit.

667
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,800
Yes, on the one hand, on the other hand, and so on.

668
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Having been a scientist most of my life

669
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,800
and only gotten involved in policy matters,

670
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,800
I would say in the last 20 years,

671
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,800
I at one point heard the phrase science-informed policy.

672
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,800
And I thought when I heard it, well, of course,

673
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,800
what other kind of policy is there?

674
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,800
And then I discovered that you often see in climate issues

675
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,800
policy-informed science,

676
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,800
namely that the description of the science

677
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,800
is meant to conform to what policy makers would like to have happen.

678
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,800
So I leave you with those general thoughts

679
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,800
and welcome any comments or questions that you might have.
