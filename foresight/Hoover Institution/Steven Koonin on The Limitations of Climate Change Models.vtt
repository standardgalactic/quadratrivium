WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
OK, since this is a policy-oriented gathering,

00:13.000 --> 00:16.320
I thought the best thing I could do as a scientist

00:16.320 --> 00:20.640
was to lay out some of the factual context for climate

00:20.640 --> 00:24.680
and the closely related subject of energy.

00:24.680 --> 00:28.320
So if you listen to most of the political dialogue

00:28.320 --> 00:31.560
and certainly the media, what you hear

00:31.560 --> 00:35.000
is that climate science compels us

00:35.000 --> 00:39.480
to make large and rapid reductions in greenhouse gas

00:39.480 --> 00:43.680
emissions, take climate action immediately

00:43.680 --> 00:45.680
and on a large scale.

00:45.680 --> 00:49.080
And that is driven by the fact that global greenhouse gas

00:49.080 --> 00:56.640
emissions have been rising at about 1.5% a year.

00:56.640 --> 01:02.800
The UN says that we need to get to net zero emissions

01:02.800 --> 01:06.720
by 30 years from now in order to, quote,

01:06.720 --> 01:10.520
avoid the worst effects of climate change.

01:10.520 --> 01:17.520
And they have various trajectories of emissions going forward.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.120
Do I have a pointer, by the way?

01:19.120 --> 01:21.000
I guess not.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.640
As you can see there, emissions would

01:23.640 --> 01:28.480
have to go to zero by 2050 or so if we

01:28.480 --> 01:30.120
are to keep the global temperature

01:30.120 --> 01:35.480
rise to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial.

01:38.560 --> 01:42.200
You think about policy required to implement something

01:42.200 --> 01:46.640
like that, and they have to strike a balance.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.480
On the one side, we've got the certainties and uncertainties

01:50.480 --> 01:53.040
of climate science, and I was amused

01:53.040 --> 01:55.520
to hear during the banking talk yesterday

01:55.520 --> 02:00.360
the reverence with which physics and chemistry are

02:00.360 --> 02:03.800
treated in terms of the precision and certainty

02:03.800 --> 02:04.840
of their understanding.

02:04.840 --> 02:08.320
It's very much not the case.

02:08.320 --> 02:11.080
And the hazards and the risks of a changing climate.

02:11.080 --> 02:14.960
And on the other side, as we'll see the world's growing demand

02:14.960 --> 02:18.880
for reliable, affordable, and clean energy.

02:18.880 --> 02:22.440
Striking that balance is about policy.

02:22.440 --> 02:27.280
You have to fold in values and priorities, environment

02:27.280 --> 02:32.440
versus development, tolerance for risk, equity

02:32.440 --> 02:36.560
across North-South and across generations,

02:36.560 --> 02:38.800
and really do any of the responses

02:38.800 --> 02:42.000
that you might make in policy, make a difference,

02:42.000 --> 02:45.560
and how much will they cost.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.400
And of course, it's in the center box

02:47.400 --> 02:52.560
that I expect most of you are interested and focused.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.160
So I want to take you through some

02:54.160 --> 02:58.280
of the considerations involved in striking that balance

02:58.280 --> 03:01.480
in the form of three high-level statements.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.840
The first is that the notion of a climate crisis, which

03:04.840 --> 03:09.760
you hear so often, has scant scientific support.

03:09.760 --> 03:14.720
The climate today is not broken, and fears of future catastrophes

03:14.720 --> 03:18.760
depend on extreme emission scenarios that

03:18.760 --> 03:25.320
are fed into models that are entirely unsuited to the task.

03:25.320 --> 03:31.760
And so if we act too rapidly and in an ill-thought-through way,

03:31.760 --> 03:36.080
we will incur a greater threat to human well-being

03:36.080 --> 03:37.720
than climate change itself.

03:37.720 --> 03:41.400
And of course, I'm going to show you data and trends that

03:41.400 --> 03:43.760
support these statements.

03:43.760 --> 03:48.400
The second is that if you advocate for rapid or overly

03:48.400 --> 03:51.640
rapid global decarbonization, you've

03:51.640 --> 03:55.560
got a moral issue, which I will try to elucidate.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.880
And the third is if you try to decarbonize too rapidly

03:58.880 --> 04:01.760
at the national level, it's going

04:01.760 --> 04:05.440
to be disruptive, expensive, and will ultimately

04:05.440 --> 04:09.120
degrade national security.

04:09.120 --> 04:13.080
Let me start with a definition first.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.040
Weather is not climate.

04:16.040 --> 04:20.720
Climate is the long-term average, typically 30 years,

04:20.720 --> 04:23.360
of the properties of weather.

04:23.360 --> 04:27.640
And that's nicely illustrated by this chart, which

04:27.640 --> 04:32.280
shows about a 900-year-long record

04:32.280 --> 04:36.680
of the annual height of the Nile River measured

04:36.680 --> 04:40.280
during the summer minimum in Cairo.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.600
The Egyptians, of course, cared a lot

04:42.600 --> 04:45.520
about the height of the Nile, as did the people who

04:45.520 --> 04:48.760
were ruling Egypt in any given time.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.960
And what you see when you look at this graph,

04:50.960 --> 04:54.800
the blue values are the annual values,

04:54.800 --> 04:59.360
is that there's a lot of up and down from year to year.

04:59.360 --> 05:02.200
One year, it could be up at almost 6 meters,

05:02.200 --> 05:08.000
and the next year or so, it's down at 2 meters or 1 meter.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.840
So that's whether it happens year to year.

05:12.840 --> 05:16.600
The second is if you look at the 30-year average, which

05:16.600 --> 05:25.240
is the red line, you can see that it also goes up and down a lot.

05:25.240 --> 05:29.840
And if you were alive during the first 150 years of this record,

05:29.840 --> 05:33.920
you would see the annual minimum going down and down.

05:33.920 --> 05:37.600
And no doubt, some medieval Egyptian climate panel

05:37.600 --> 05:40.320
would be screaming new normal, new normal,

05:40.320 --> 05:43.960
and recommending prayers and sacrifice.

05:43.960 --> 05:48.160
In fact, the climate varies a lot on its own.

05:48.160 --> 05:53.360
Human influences were entirely absent during this time.

05:53.360 --> 05:57.240
And if they had just waited a couple of hundred years

05:57.240 --> 06:01.160
after 700, you see it comes back up quite a lot.

06:01.160 --> 06:05.560
So you can get fooled a lot by year to year variability

06:05.560 --> 06:08.200
or by variability over decades.

06:08.200 --> 06:12.400
And untangling the response to human influences

06:12.400 --> 06:16.040
from this natural variability of the climate system

06:16.040 --> 06:21.120
is something that is a major challenge in the science

06:21.120 --> 06:21.720
these days.

06:21.720 --> 06:25.200
We do it a lot in the media.

06:25.200 --> 06:30.400
The media entirely misrepresent the science.

06:30.400 --> 06:34.120
Here's a little vignette.

06:34.120 --> 06:37.520
NASA press release in March of 2020.

06:37.520 --> 06:42.880
The Guardian used newspaper in the UK in December 2019.

06:42.880 --> 06:47.720
Headline, Greenland's ice sheet is melting seven times faster

06:47.720 --> 06:50.240
than in the 1990s.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.720
And if you look in the text of the article,

06:52.720 --> 06:56.800
the rate of ice loss has risen from 33 billion tons a year

06:56.800 --> 07:03.120
in the 90s to 254 billion tons a year in the past decade.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.360
That's a true statement.

07:05.360 --> 07:08.000
But if you look at it in context,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.160
it carries a very different message.

07:11.160 --> 07:15.480
Here's the actual data compiled by the Danish

07:15.480 --> 07:18.880
Meteorological Institute.

07:18.880 --> 07:23.320
This is how much Greenland lost in ice year by year

07:23.320 --> 07:25.360
averaged over 10 years.

07:25.360 --> 07:30.160
And you can see that from 1990 to 2012 or so,

07:30.160 --> 07:32.760
it did go up a lot.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.080
It's a lot of part of this graph.

07:35.080 --> 07:39.000
But if you look at the past almost 100 years,

07:39.000 --> 07:40.760
it went up and down a lot.

07:40.760 --> 07:46.080
And if you go back to 1930, when human influences were much

07:46.080 --> 07:48.920
smaller than they are today, about one-fifth,

07:48.920 --> 07:52.200
you can see that it was losing ice almost as much.

07:52.200 --> 07:59.080
And even as the globe warmed from 1930 up to 2022,

07:59.080 --> 08:00.800
the ice loss went up and down.

08:00.960 --> 08:05.400
In fact, it's currently declining rather than going up.

08:05.400 --> 08:09.120
So this is not global warming.

08:09.120 --> 08:10.720
This is weather.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.640
Turns out to be weather in the North Atlantic.

08:15.280 --> 08:17.680
So it's impossible to talk about weather

08:17.680 --> 08:20.400
without talking about the unusual heat

08:20.400 --> 08:23.600
that we have seen this summer.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.040
Here is context.

08:25.040 --> 08:29.840
This is data from the US EPA, official government data.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.120
It's the Heat Wave Index.

08:31.120 --> 08:34.680
We can talk about how you define heat waves, but not now.

08:34.680 --> 08:40.320
And you can see that in the last 40 years or so from 1980,

08:40.320 --> 08:42.800
not much changed.

08:42.800 --> 08:45.880
This does not include the last summer, of course.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.400
We don't have that data yet.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.160
But even so, one year is not going

08:50.160 --> 08:53.040
to make all that much difference in a climate sense.

08:53.040 --> 08:56.200
And it was a lot more active in terms of heat waves

08:56.200 --> 08:59.440
in the 1930s than it is now.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.400
Again, human influence is much smaller.

09:04.920 --> 09:07.440
This is the satellite-derived record

09:07.440 --> 09:10.240
of the global temperature, temperature of the lower

09:10.240 --> 09:14.120
atmosphere, month by month.

09:14.120 --> 09:19.920
And the last point in that graph is July 2023, last month.

09:19.920 --> 09:24.760
And you can see, wow, big spike, right?

09:24.760 --> 09:28.800
But when you look at it, you see other big spikes, mostly

09:28.800 --> 09:31.240
due to El Ninos.

09:31.240 --> 09:36.120
And you can see that there's a gradual long-term trend.

09:36.120 --> 09:39.560
So however much the media and other folks

09:39.560 --> 09:44.920
make of the unusually hot July that we have had,

09:44.920 --> 09:48.280
that's not human influences.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.720
It's weather.

09:49.720 --> 09:54.800
The long-term trend in this data may well be human influences,

09:54.800 --> 09:58.440
but they can't resist capitalizing on dramatic weather

09:58.440 --> 10:03.000
events to make the point.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.680
There it is.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.320
What are the causes?

10:06.320 --> 10:09.480
Maybe greenhouse gases, but that seems unlikely again,

10:09.480 --> 10:12.880
because greenhouse gases act over long-time periods

10:12.880 --> 10:14.480
smoothly.

10:14.480 --> 10:19.080
El Nino, we are in the beginnings of another El Nino cycle.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.960
There are other oscillations in the climate system

10:21.960 --> 10:25.400
that are conspiring to work together.

10:25.400 --> 10:28.880
Stratospheric water vapor is another explanation.

10:28.880 --> 10:33.360
You may not know that in January of last year,

10:33.360 --> 10:37.400
there was an enormous underwater volcanic eruption

10:37.400 --> 10:41.080
that increased the water vapor in the upper atmosphere

10:41.080 --> 10:43.480
by 10% to 13%.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.640
You can see it here in this graph.

10:45.640 --> 10:50.040
That big, dark blob at the end of the graph the most recent

10:50.040 --> 10:54.080
years is the water vapor from this underground eruption,

10:54.080 --> 10:55.480
undersea eruption.

10:55.480 --> 10:59.480
And that increases the heat trapping of the atmosphere.

10:59.480 --> 11:01.880
And then finally, we've been cleaning up

11:01.880 --> 11:04.880
the lower atmosphere from coal emissions

11:04.880 --> 11:07.840
and from ship emissions that allows the Earth

11:07.840 --> 11:09.720
to absorb a little more sunlight.

11:09.720 --> 11:13.920
And that's also playing a role in the recent warming.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.120
Finally, urban heat island.

11:15.120 --> 11:18.240
You hear a lot about records being broken.

11:18.280 --> 11:21.840
Phoenix, Houston, and so on.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.400
The temperature in the cities is hotter than the surroundings,

11:25.400 --> 11:28.000
as much as five or six degrees.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.960
And if you've got a weather station that's

11:29.960 --> 11:33.120
in the middle of a city that's growing and growing and growing,

11:33.120 --> 11:36.360
the heating of the city starts to affect whether you're

11:36.360 --> 11:38.040
going to break a record or not.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.400
Temperature is not the only thing

11:44.400 --> 11:46.840
that is a manifestation of climate.

11:46.840 --> 11:51.640
Of much greater concern are extreme weather events

11:51.640 --> 11:53.400
and sea level rise.

11:53.400 --> 11:57.800
This is a chart from the most recent UN report issued

11:57.800 --> 12:00.760
about a year ago.

12:00.760 --> 12:04.640
And the colors indicate whether a trend has been observed

12:04.640 --> 12:08.320
or not in various phenomena.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.960
The ones associated with heat and cold, well, yeah,

12:10.960 --> 12:12.640
we've got more heat.

12:12.640 --> 12:16.480
More heat waves globally, though not in the US,

12:16.480 --> 12:19.280
less fewer cold spells.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.960
But then there's a whole category of wet and dry

12:21.960 --> 12:24.320
for which there is no trend.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.800
There's a whole category of wind,

12:26.800 --> 12:30.520
including tropical cyclones, hurricanes, typhoons,

12:30.520 --> 12:33.760
again, for which there is no trend, et cetera.

12:33.760 --> 12:37.600
So in fact, for most of the extreme weather events,

12:37.600 --> 12:42.200
we have not seen trends over the last century.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.520
Here's some of the text that goes along with it.

12:44.520 --> 12:50.240
Low confidence in most reported long-term trends in hurricanes.

12:50.240 --> 12:53.840
Low confidence in mid-latitude storms.

12:53.840 --> 12:58.520
Tornadoes hail lightning, no trends, et cetera, et cetera.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.960
The one in which there is confidence

13:00.960 --> 13:05.640
is that we have seen some increase in heavy precipitation

13:05.640 --> 13:08.000
on a global scale over land.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.880
We can go on and on again.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.680
Not a lot that gives us support

13:12.680 --> 13:15.560
that there is a climate crisis underway.

13:17.720 --> 13:20.000
Here's some of the data for hurricanes.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.840
This is the record of the number of hurricanes globally.

13:23.840 --> 13:27.080
Upper trace is all tropical storms.

13:27.080 --> 13:29.560
Lower trace are hurricanes.

13:29.560 --> 13:33.080
And this is a record that extends over 50-some-odd years.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.720
It's hard to see any change at all.

13:36.720 --> 13:39.800
This is a measure of hurricane activity.

13:39.800 --> 13:43.640
It waits the strongest storms more than the weaker storms.

13:43.640 --> 13:47.080
Again, globally in the top, northern hemisphere in the bottom,

13:47.080 --> 13:50.360
lots of ups and downs over 50 years,

13:50.360 --> 13:52.480
but it's hard to find any effect.

13:52.480 --> 13:57.960
And in fact, the official reports say we can't find any trends.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.880
I'm not going to go through the language,

13:59.880 --> 14:02.640
but that's what it says.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.640
By the way, I don't know if you'll have access

14:04.760 --> 14:08.680
to the charts, but they have links to all of the supporting

14:08.680 --> 14:13.880
either UN reports or quality peer-reviewed literature

14:13.880 --> 14:17.400
in each of the statements.

14:17.400 --> 14:21.200
So that's the climate of today and the past.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.960
You might ask, what about the future?

14:23.960 --> 14:27.400
Well, for that, we rely on models.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.800
And one of the major measures of a model

14:29.800 --> 14:34.800
is how sensitive is it to increasing the carbon dioxide?

14:34.800 --> 14:37.600
If you doubled the carbon dioxide in the model,

14:37.600 --> 14:40.680
by how much would the temperature go up?

14:40.680 --> 14:43.200
And that's shown in this graph.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.640
There are about 40 different models listed there.

14:46.640 --> 14:49.800
They're produced by institutes and universities

14:49.800 --> 14:51.600
around the world.

14:51.600 --> 14:56.480
And what's parted is how sensitive the model is.

14:56.480 --> 15:01.480
And the ones in yellow, about 40% of them,

15:01.480 --> 15:05.440
were deemed too sensitive by the UN,

15:05.440 --> 15:08.960
and so are not used at all.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.760
That's a little bit scary.

15:10.760 --> 15:15.000
The world's best models making their best tries

15:15.000 --> 15:19.520
get it wrong 40% of the time.

15:19.520 --> 15:23.520
It's even worse when you ask, how well do the models produce

15:23.520 --> 15:26.400
the temperature history that we've seen?

15:26.400 --> 15:28.440
And that's shown on these graphs.

15:28.440 --> 15:31.880
The black is the actual observed temperature

15:31.880 --> 15:35.280
rise of the globe, and the different traces

15:35.280 --> 15:37.560
are the different models.

15:37.560 --> 15:40.120
And you can see that many of the models

15:40.120 --> 15:43.960
differ from the data or they differ from themselves

15:43.960 --> 15:46.040
by more than the temperature rise

15:46.040 --> 15:49.440
that they're trying to describe.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.360
And in fact, even the climate models

15:51.360 --> 15:53.840
don't believe their own models, at least

15:53.840 --> 15:55.840
at the regional level.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.480
Tim Palmer at Oxford and Bjorn Stevens,

15:58.480 --> 16:00.840
who is the director of the Max Planck Institute

16:00.840 --> 16:04.920
for Meteorology, says, for many key applications,

16:04.920 --> 16:09.080
the current generation of models is not fit for purpose.

16:09.080 --> 16:13.680
There's Bjorn, he gave a lecture at UCLA about a year ago,

16:13.680 --> 16:15.840
and he says, it's difficult in many places

16:15.840 --> 16:19.920
impossible to scientifically advise societal efforts

16:19.920 --> 16:23.200
to adapt in the face of unavoidable warming.

16:23.200 --> 16:27.040
We can't assess the extent to which a given degree of warming

16:27.040 --> 16:29.640
poses an existential threat.

16:29.640 --> 16:34.080
And there's Tim Palmer in an email not publicly published,

16:34.080 --> 16:38.640
but broadly published in the National Academy membership.

16:38.640 --> 16:41.080
He says, our understanding of climate change,

16:41.080 --> 16:45.560
especially at the regional scale, is rather poor.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.760
How can a country adapt if it doesn't even

16:47.760 --> 16:50.560
know the sign of precipitation change

16:50.560 --> 16:54.240
as the IPCC figures show?

16:54.240 --> 16:55.880
And he says, the policy and decision

16:55.880 --> 16:59.680
make us start to feel uncomfortable when we say that.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.920
They'd rather we didn't say such things in public.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.480
They claim it undermines the public's faith

17:05.480 --> 17:08.200
in the need to take action.

17:08.200 --> 17:13.520
And I think this is a disease, a dysfunction of the science

17:13.520 --> 17:16.280
in this particular field.

17:16.280 --> 17:19.400
As a scientist, I think it's our duty

17:19.400 --> 17:23.600
to lay out the science, knowns and unknowns,

17:23.600 --> 17:28.400
transparently, completely, and without bias.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.440
That's not happening.

17:30.440 --> 17:34.160
I can tell you, show you specific examples.

17:34.160 --> 17:37.800
All right, let's look at just one or two more model projections.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.240
Sea level.

17:39.240 --> 17:42.840
I live most of the time in Manhattan in New York City.

17:42.840 --> 17:46.240
There's been a tide gauge at the foot of Manhattan

17:46.240 --> 17:51.840
the southern tip for 150 years, maybe a little more.

17:51.840 --> 17:57.120
This is the rate of rise of the sea

17:57.120 --> 18:01.280
at the tip of Manhattan since 1920.

18:01.280 --> 18:05.600
It averages about three millimeters a year, you can see.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.200
But it goes up and down.

18:07.200 --> 18:11.120
Three millimeters a year, by the way, is a foot a century.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.560
NOAA, the part of the US government

18:13.560 --> 18:16.120
concerned with oceans and atmospheres,

18:16.120 --> 18:19.520
says that over the next 30 years,

18:19.520 --> 18:23.680
this graph is going to do that.

18:23.680 --> 18:25.920
Remarkable.

18:25.920 --> 18:28.560
Who am I to challenge NOAA?

18:28.560 --> 18:32.880
But we'll know soon enough whether that's going to happen or not.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.840
And in fact, other researchers say,

18:35.840 --> 18:37.920
you shouldn't be using these models

18:37.920 --> 18:40.160
because they're not very precise.

18:40.160 --> 18:42.040
They're not very accurate and so on.

18:42.040 --> 18:47.160
Giving an impression of false confidence to users.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.680
Well, if you can't believe the models

18:48.680 --> 18:51.360
about what's going to happen going forward,

18:51.360 --> 18:54.920
how might we get a handle on how things are going to change

18:54.920 --> 18:57.360
as the globe warms?

18:57.360 --> 18:59.400
Well, we can look at the past.

18:59.400 --> 19:03.160
So here's the global average temperature since 1850.

19:03.160 --> 19:07.600
And you can see that since 1900 or so,

19:07.600 --> 19:14.440
it's gone up by about 1.3 degrees to the present.

19:14.440 --> 19:17.840
That's just about the same amount of warming

19:17.840 --> 19:24.800
that the UN predicts on average to the end of the century, 2100.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.600
What will be the impacts?

19:26.600 --> 19:30.600
Well, we don't know, but we can see how the globe has fared

19:30.600 --> 19:34.160
during the previous 120 years.

19:34.160 --> 19:40.400
And the answer is humanity has prospered as never before.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.240
The global temperature went up by 1.3 degrees.

19:43.240 --> 19:46.920
The population went up by a factor of 5.

19:46.920 --> 19:52.960
Life expectancy went from 32 years to almost 73 years.

19:52.960 --> 19:56.760
The literacy fraction jumped by a factor of 4.

19:56.760 --> 20:01.400
GDP per capita went up by a factor of 7, et cetera, et cetera.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.720
And the death rate from extreme weather

20:03.720 --> 20:08.800
went down by a factor of 50, even as the globe

20:08.800 --> 20:13.120
warmed 1.3 degrees.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.840
That doesn't say things are going

20:14.840 --> 20:18.080
to be perfect over the next 80 years,

20:18.080 --> 20:21.880
but it sure gives some sense that humanity is perfectly

20:21.880 --> 20:28.480
capable of adapting and flourishing as conditions change.

20:28.480 --> 20:32.040
Here's one example of that, agriculture.

20:32.040 --> 20:37.160
This is 60 years' worth of agricultural data globally.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.080
The land area used for grain production

20:40.080 --> 20:43.120
hasn't gone up at all, shown by the lower trace.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.320
But the population, of course, has gone up.

20:45.320 --> 20:50.240
The grain yield, which is how many bushels per acre you get,

20:50.240 --> 20:54.560
or tons per acre, or whatever, has gone up spectacularly

20:54.560 --> 20:57.080
as agronomy has gotten better.

20:57.080 --> 20:59.800
And the grain production, how much grain

20:59.800 --> 21:05.400
the world actually produces, has also gone up by 250%,

21:05.400 --> 21:09.680
even as the globe warmed up.

21:09.680 --> 21:13.840
If you look at weather losses, how much GDP

21:13.840 --> 21:17.440
did you spend because of extreme weather events?

21:17.440 --> 21:19.560
This is global data.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.520
You can see, first of all, that it

21:21.520 --> 21:27.520
hovers around a quarter of a percent of GDP.

21:27.520 --> 21:32.360
Second, you can see it's actually gone down a little bit.

21:32.360 --> 21:35.240
Again, people who are concerned will say, well,

21:35.240 --> 21:37.040
this is just going to go up and up.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.000
But in fact, as the world develops,

21:39.000 --> 21:42.600
we get more and more resilient and able to deal

21:42.600 --> 21:44.360
with extreme weather events.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.000
And in any event, right now, it's only a quarter

21:47.000 --> 21:50.920
percent of GDP globally.

21:50.920 --> 21:53.480
What about the economic impacts?

21:53.480 --> 21:57.640
Well, last March, about four months ago,

21:57.640 --> 22:01.320
the White House put out a white paper

22:01.320 --> 22:05.800
that summarized the result of 12 independent peer-reviewed

22:05.800 --> 22:13.000
studies of how much warming would affect the US GDP.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.600
This graph comes from that report.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.560
And what you can see is that as the change

22:18.560 --> 22:21.400
in global surface temperature, it's

22:21.400 --> 22:24.640
in degrees Fahrenheit because this is a US graph.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.080
But OK.

22:26.080 --> 22:29.000
We're currently at that vertical line.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.680
And you can see that it's expected

22:31.680 --> 22:37.120
that warming has affected the US GDP.

22:37.120 --> 22:40.000
Those different lines indicate different models.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.920
The black line is the average.

22:41.920 --> 22:47.200
You can see it's down at less than a tenth of a percent.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.960
And that if we go out to the extreme end of this chart,

22:50.960 --> 22:55.520
which is where we would be under the Paris 2 degree warming,

22:55.520 --> 22:58.400
you can see it's still at 2%.

22:58.400 --> 23:04.200
In other words, the economy would be 2% smaller in 2100,

23:04.200 --> 23:07.440
let's say, than it would have been otherwise.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.760
It's in the noise.

23:09.760 --> 23:12.280
Bjorn Lomborg and another paper compiled

23:12.280 --> 23:17.200
a similar set of estimates for the globe as a whole.

23:17.200 --> 23:23.320
And again, the takeaway is a few percent for a few degrees.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.600
Well, you might say, well, what about tipping points?

23:25.600 --> 23:28.040
And of course, people have studied that as well.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.040
There's a paper.

23:29.040 --> 23:33.000
It's another 1% or 2% for the tipping points.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.880
And so economically, this is in the noise.

23:37.880 --> 23:41.880
Now, you might argue GDP is not the only thing that matters.

23:41.880 --> 23:45.680
There will be differential impacts, poor people versus rich people,

23:45.680 --> 23:53.440
et cetera, all true, but hardly a catastrophe or existential threat.

23:53.440 --> 23:56.760
OK, let me turn to the second statement I wanted to make,

23:56.760 --> 24:02.600
and that advocacy for rapid decarbonization globally is immoral.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.280
And it starts with demographics.

24:05.280 --> 24:08.800
This is the global population historically

24:08.800 --> 24:13.400
and projected out to 2100.

24:13.400 --> 24:17.920
And you can see we've just crossed 8 billion people right now.

24:17.920 --> 24:21.560
And according to this projection, we'll get to 10 billion

24:21.560 --> 24:25.240
by the end of the century.

24:25.240 --> 24:29.600
Most of the growth between now and the end of the century

24:29.600 --> 24:34.280
is in Asia and in Africa.

24:34.280 --> 24:37.800
That means that the developed world, where there are one and a half billion

24:37.800 --> 24:41.680
of us, is getting older.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.040
The developing world is younger.

24:44.040 --> 24:48.400
And urbanization is proceeding at a spectacular pace.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.600
50 million people a year.

24:50.600 --> 24:55.560
The equivalent to six New York cities a year are getting created.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.560
Half of the world now is urbanized.

24:57.560 --> 25:01.600
70% will be by the end of the century.

25:02.480 --> 25:06.960
Steve Haber yesterday talked about the developed world bubble

25:06.960 --> 25:12.000
we're sort of living in, I would say almost echo chamber.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
This graph makes it rather apparent.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.400
What's plotted here is for a number of representative countries

25:20.400 --> 25:22.800
indicated on the right.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.800
The annual energy consumption per capita.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.800
How much energy did it get?

25:27.800 --> 25:30.800
The annual energy consumption per capita.

25:30.800 --> 25:34.800
How much energy did each person use?

25:34.800 --> 25:42.800
Parted as a function of the GDP per capita in constant 2017 dollars.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.800
And you can see that there are lots of interesting things

25:45.800 --> 25:48.800
to understand about this chart.

25:48.800 --> 25:55.800
Some of us in the US, Canada, some other very developed countries,

25:56.800 --> 25:58.800
we sit in the upper right corner.

25:58.800 --> 26:03.800
We have a relatively high GDP as a result.

26:03.800 --> 26:06.800
In the middle of the graph you find the European countries

26:06.800 --> 26:08.800
and a number of other middle countries

26:08.800 --> 26:11.800
that use about half the energy per capita of the US

26:11.800 --> 26:14.800
and have a somewhat smaller GDP.

26:14.800 --> 26:18.800
And down on the lower left corner you see a set of countries

26:18.800 --> 26:22.800
whose energy use increases universally

26:23.800 --> 26:28.800
and monotonically as they get richer.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.800
Richer countries use more energy

26:30.800 --> 26:33.800
and when you're a developing country down on the lower left

26:33.800 --> 26:39.800
your energy use is going to go up a lot as you become better off.

26:39.800 --> 26:43.800
What is sobering about this chart

26:43.800 --> 26:46.800
is that there are only one and a half billion people

26:46.800 --> 26:49.800
in the upper parts of this chart.

26:49.800 --> 26:53.800
If you go down to the bottom left you've got about six billion people.

26:53.800 --> 26:57.800
And so it's pretty clear that as they improve their standard of living

26:57.800 --> 27:02.800
by using more energy, the energy demand is going to go up.

27:05.800 --> 27:09.800
People down there, maybe some of you come from those countries

27:09.800 --> 27:13.800
that have been in them, life without energy is no fun.

27:13.800 --> 27:18.800
It means cooking and heating with what's politely called

27:18.800 --> 27:22.800
traditional biomass or wood and dung.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.800
The indoor air pollution from that is terrible,

27:25.800 --> 27:29.800
kills two million people a year.

27:29.800 --> 27:35.800
Without 24-hour lighting, you've got to study under extreme conditions.

27:35.800 --> 27:38.800
It's okay to eat romantically by candlelight,

27:38.800 --> 27:43.800
but studying by candlelight is no fun.

27:43.800 --> 27:46.800
The inequalities are astounding.

27:46.800 --> 27:54.800
Nigeria consumes one-thirtieth the energy per capita that we do in the U.S.

27:54.800 --> 27:57.800
And there are three billion people in the world,

27:57.800 --> 27:59.800
three-eighths of the population,

27:59.800 --> 28:04.800
that use less electricity per year than the average U.S. refrigerator.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.800
And I will say with a little bit of embarrassment,

28:07.800 --> 28:11.800
I have three refrigerators in my house in New York.

28:14.800 --> 28:18.800
So if you combine the demographics of population growth

28:18.800 --> 28:22.800
with the need for energy as you develop,

28:22.800 --> 28:26.800
you get a strong growth in energy consumption.

28:26.800 --> 28:29.800
This is shown projected out to 2050.

28:29.800 --> 28:33.800
Again, you can see most of the growth, about 50% in total,

28:33.800 --> 28:35.800
is there in Asia.

28:35.800 --> 28:39.800
And the developed world is pretty flat.

28:39.800 --> 28:43.800
And where are we going to get that if we don't change our policies?

28:43.800 --> 28:47.800
Most of it is going to continue to come from fossil fuels,

28:47.800 --> 28:51.800
even though renewables may grow strongly.

28:53.800 --> 28:57.800
Fossil fuels continue to dominate.

28:57.800 --> 29:02.800
This shows where the world got its energy from different sources,

29:02.800 --> 29:06.800
from 1965 up until the present.

29:06.800 --> 29:11.800
And you can see that the great bulk of the world's energy

29:11.800 --> 29:16.800
comes from the bottom segments, oil, coal, and gas.

29:16.800 --> 29:22.800
The others growing a little bit, but not a tremendously rapid amount.

29:22.800 --> 29:27.800
The world has spent about $4 trillion over the last decade

29:27.800 --> 29:31.800
trying to change the energy mix.

29:31.800 --> 29:37.800
But fossil fuels still amount to just about 80% of the world's energy.

29:39.800 --> 29:43.800
And that means that there are going to be increased emissions

29:43.800 --> 29:48.800
from the developing world, whatever we do in the OECD.

29:48.800 --> 29:52.800
You can see right now emissions are just about half and half

29:52.800 --> 29:57.800
the vertical line 2020, but as we go out to mid-century,

29:57.800 --> 30:00.800
the developing world dominates.

30:00.800 --> 30:04.800
That's because fossil fuels are in fact the most reliable

30:04.800 --> 30:09.800
and convenient way for those countries to get the energy that they need.

30:11.800 --> 30:16.800
There's a guy, political scientist, economist named Anthony Downs,

30:16.800 --> 30:19.800
who died about two years ago.

30:19.800 --> 30:24.800
He wound up working at Brookings, but for the early part of his career

30:24.800 --> 30:27.800
in the 60s, he was working at UCLA,

30:27.800 --> 30:31.800
watching the smog get worse and worse

30:31.800 --> 30:36.800
as more and more people were able to acquire automobiles.

30:36.800 --> 30:40.800
And he wrote a wonderful paper called Up and Down with Ecology.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.800
In 1972, I would highly recommend it.

30:43.800 --> 30:47.800
What he said there is that the elite's environmental deterioration

30:47.800 --> 30:53.800
is often the common man's improved standard of living.

30:53.800 --> 30:57.800
And so we in the developed world might clutch our pearls

30:57.800 --> 31:03.800
and recoil with horror at the threat of human-induced climate change.

31:03.800 --> 31:08.800
The folks in the developing world have much bigger problems,

31:08.800 --> 31:12.800
more immediate problems, and more readily soluble.

31:12.800 --> 31:17.800
And so when we say the science compels us to make emissions reductions,

31:17.800 --> 31:20.800
they say, what do you mean us?

31:20.800 --> 31:26.800
Well, you have PM Modi in India saying the colonial mindset hasn't gone,

31:26.800 --> 31:32.800
the developing nations are closing to us the path that made them developed.

31:32.800 --> 31:38.800
And the ex-president of Niger, who was just opposed in a coup,

31:38.800 --> 31:41.800
said about a year ago,

31:41.800 --> 31:44.800
Africa's being punished by decisions of Western countries

31:44.800 --> 31:49.800
to end public financing for foreign fossil fuel projects by the end of 2022.

31:49.800 --> 31:56.800
You see this when the IMF or the World Bank refused to fund fossil fuel projects.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.800
We're going to continue to fight.

31:58.800 --> 32:01.800
We have fossil fuels that should be exploited.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.800
So there is a moral issue.

32:03.800 --> 32:07.800
For those of us who are sitting fat and happy in the developed world,

32:07.800 --> 32:10.800
what are we going to tell these folks?

32:10.800 --> 32:17.800
Nobody's got a good answer, as I've gone around and asked that question.

32:17.800 --> 32:22.800
Finally, let me turn a little bit to rapid national decarbonization.

32:22.800 --> 32:28.800
You say, well, okay, the US, EU should lead the way and reduce our emissions.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.800
Well, it's not so simple.

32:30.800 --> 32:34.800
Because to borrow a phrase from a movie recently,

32:34.800 --> 32:38.800
energy touches everything everywhere all the time.

32:38.800 --> 32:43.800
It is one of the fundamental systems of society.

32:43.800 --> 32:49.800
Energy systems evolve very slowly because they need to be reliable

32:49.800 --> 32:52.800
and the assets last a long time.

32:52.800 --> 32:57.800
Power plants, refineries, automobiles, etc.

32:57.800 --> 33:02.800
So you tinker with the energy system at your peril.

33:02.800 --> 33:07.800
If you try to make the energy system change too rapidly,

33:07.800 --> 33:12.800
it is going to be, it will be, extraordinarily disruptive.

33:12.800 --> 33:17.800
The cost and reliability of energy services.

33:17.800 --> 33:23.800
California here has very close to the highest electricity rates in the country

33:23.800 --> 33:30.800
because of the strong dependence on solar and wind.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.800
We're going to change the way people are employed.

33:33.800 --> 33:39.800
You put in electric cars, mechanics will disappear, the flow of funds,

33:39.800 --> 33:44.800
you lose the fuel tax, what are you going to do to replace that?

33:44.800 --> 33:50.800
Financing an electric car, as an example, costs a lot more upfront

33:50.800 --> 33:55.800
but has lower operating costs, at least until the government starts taxing it

33:55.800 --> 33:59.800
to recover the lost fuel revenues.

33:59.800 --> 34:02.800
Domestic manufacturing costs increase.

34:02.800 --> 34:07.800
If you make energy expensive, manufacturing gets expensive.

34:07.800 --> 34:11.800
Germany, which has the highest energy costs almost in the world,

34:11.800 --> 34:15.800
is seeing an outflux of manufacturing

34:15.800 --> 34:20.800
as the manufacturers de-camp for cheaper energy costs elsewhere.

34:20.800 --> 34:25.800
You deploy immature technologies, you're going to have to replace them.

34:25.800 --> 34:28.800
Wind is not quite up to snuff yet

34:28.800 --> 34:32.800
and so we're seeing a lot of wind turbines having to get replaced

34:32.800 --> 34:35.800
before their projected end of life.

34:35.800 --> 34:38.800
Thirty years it's turning out to be more like 15

34:38.800 --> 34:42.800
because we haven't taken the time to mature the technologies.

34:42.800 --> 34:44.800
We need new supply chains.

34:44.800 --> 34:49.800
A major part of the energy transition is going to be technologies

34:49.800 --> 34:53.800
that employ exotic materials, relatively exotic.

34:53.800 --> 34:58.800
Lithium, more copper, cobalt manganese rare earths

34:58.800 --> 35:04.800
because renewable energies have to harvest energy

35:04.800 --> 35:09.800
over very large areas and they need to be very efficient at harvesting it

35:09.800 --> 35:13.800
so you need fancy magnets and conductors and so on.

35:13.800 --> 35:16.800
So you've got to rejigger the supply chains

35:16.800 --> 35:22.800
and right now China has got a market on the processing of these exotic materials

35:22.800 --> 35:28.800
and that's causing grief, if you like, in the energy transition.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.800
How much is it going to cost?

35:30.800 --> 35:33.800
Well, it's hard to estimate but people try.

35:33.800 --> 35:39.800
A number of estimates show that to go net zero by 2050

35:39.800 --> 35:47.800
in the U.S. is going to cost somewhere between 5 and 7% of GDP each year.

35:47.800 --> 35:51.800
That's one and a half trillion dollars a year.

35:51.800 --> 35:54.800
We could do a lot with one and a half trillion dollars

35:54.800 --> 35:56.800
besides trying to reduce our emissions

35:56.800 --> 36:00.800
when the U.S. is only 13% of global emissions anyway

36:00.800 --> 36:05.800
and the rest of the developing world is going up rather than going down.

36:05.800 --> 36:08.800
Globally the numbers are about the same.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.800
So we should be thinking hard before we commit to investing

36:12.800 --> 36:16.800
one and a half trillion a year to go net zero

36:16.800 --> 36:23.800
and we're already starting to see pushback on these overly stringent regulations

36:23.800 --> 36:27.800
that are aimed at decarbonizing the economy.

36:27.800 --> 36:33.800
In Europe we probably are seeing what people call peak green.

36:33.800 --> 36:37.800
There's been pushback in Germany, in France and the U.K. and Netherlands

36:37.800 --> 36:40.800
about how you heat your homes,

36:40.800 --> 36:45.800
whether you can ban an internal combustion engine by 2035 and so on.

36:45.800 --> 36:48.800
And there are political shifts that are underway

36:48.800 --> 36:53.800
as a result of people, consumers, being unhappy about these.

36:53.800 --> 36:58.800
The mandates in the U.S. are just beginning to affect everyday consumers

36:58.800 --> 37:01.800
and I think we will see similar pushback.

37:01.800 --> 37:05.800
People will start asking, tell me again why we're doing all of this,

37:05.800 --> 37:10.800
as electricity costs go up, as electric vehicles cost more

37:10.800 --> 37:13.800
than internal combustion engines and so on.

37:13.800 --> 37:20.800
All right, so I've given you a lot of things that are somewhat on the cup is half empty side.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.800
What do I think we should do?

37:23.800 --> 37:26.800
I think the first thing we've got to do is cancel the climate crisis.

37:26.800 --> 37:29.800
You know, when the U.N. Secretary General stands up and says

37:29.800 --> 37:33.800
we're on the highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator,

37:33.800 --> 37:39.800
that's just flat wrong and it is counterproductive.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.800
At the same time, I think we need to acknowledge the task

37:42.800 --> 37:47.800
and the challenges in trying to reduce human influences on the climate.

37:47.800 --> 37:51.800
We need to have better and more transparent representations

37:51.800 --> 37:57.800
of the scientific knowns and unknowns and the technology potentials to non-experts.

37:57.800 --> 38:01.800
And more generally, I think the public and the decision makers,

38:01.800 --> 38:06.800
including policy makers, have to become more literate about energy and climate.

38:06.800 --> 38:11.800
We need to work harder on the science, observations, understanding.

38:11.800 --> 38:15.800
We must not constrain the developing world's energy supply.

38:15.800 --> 38:20.800
If we in the West, U.S., E.U. try to do that,

38:20.800 --> 38:24.800
China is going to step in and make sure that they get the energy

38:24.800 --> 38:27.800
and that's not a good thing geopolitically.

38:27.800 --> 38:31.800
We need a greater focus on adaptation and resilience.

38:31.800 --> 38:36.800
If we can't reduce emissions sufficiently rapidly

38:36.800 --> 38:39.800
and I think there are many reasons why we can't,

38:39.800 --> 38:44.800
we need to understand how to better adapt to a changing climate.

38:44.800 --> 38:48.800
One of the things we don't do is to prepare for the past.

38:48.800 --> 38:53.800
The terrible tragedy we've seen in the last week or so in Maui

38:53.800 --> 38:58.800
was anticipated by many more than a decade ago

38:58.800 --> 39:02.800
and there are reports that say you should do X, Y and Z

39:02.800 --> 39:06.800
and of course nobody did most of them.

39:06.800 --> 39:09.800
And of course for the developing countries,

39:09.800 --> 39:12.800
we need to make sure that they improve their lot

39:12.800 --> 39:15.800
so that they can be more resilient.

39:15.800 --> 39:17.800
Technology is really important.

39:17.800 --> 39:21.800
We've got to make technologies that are low or zero emissions

39:21.800 --> 39:25.800
about as cheap as fossil fuels.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.800
I have my own favorite list there.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.800
I won't go through in any detail.

39:29.800 --> 39:33.800
And then finally, I think graceful decarbonization.

39:33.800 --> 39:37.800
Right now governments are just throwing stuff at the wall

39:37.800 --> 39:39.800
and trying to see what sticks.

39:39.800 --> 39:42.800
So you've got, for example, in the US IRA,

39:42.800 --> 39:47.800
I think totally unjustified subsidies for wind and solar

39:47.800 --> 39:52.800
when they cannot be the primary source of electricity in the country.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.800
So we need to figure out these pathways,

39:55.800 --> 40:00.800
involves technology, business, regulation, behavior.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.800
Nobody has done that.

40:02.800 --> 40:07.800
We're just all running around saying this guy is falling.

40:07.800 --> 40:09.800
Last chart.

40:09.800 --> 40:12.800
I thought it would be good to just offer a couple of thoughts

40:12.800 --> 40:16.800
on S&T input to policy more generally,

40:16.800 --> 40:20.800
not just climate and energy,

40:20.800 --> 40:24.800
but pandemics, for example.

40:24.800 --> 40:29.800
Other S&T matters, artificial intelligence.

40:29.800 --> 40:31.800
For those of you who are not experts,

40:31.800 --> 40:35.800
as most of you aren't, as I read your bios in S&T matters,

40:35.800 --> 40:38.800
don't be afraid to ask dumb questions.

40:38.800 --> 40:44.800
Sometimes they can elucidate or reveal gaps in our understanding

40:44.800 --> 40:49.800
or things that the advisors are not telling you about.

40:49.800 --> 40:54.800
Ask about the data, coverage, bias, uncertainties.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.800
We saw that in COVID.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.800
Ask about model protections.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.800
How do you know the models are right?

41:00.800 --> 41:03.800
What's the range of models that you get,

41:03.800 --> 41:09.800
for example, for the spread of COVID-19 or for climate?

41:09.800 --> 41:13.800
Do not rely on the media for S&T input in these policy matters.

41:13.800 --> 41:17.800
They get it completely wrong.

41:17.800 --> 41:20.800
It's like shooting fish in a barrel to write op-eds

41:20.800 --> 41:23.800
that pick out one another media story

41:23.800 --> 41:28.800
and confront it with the real data in climate and energy.

41:28.800 --> 41:31.800
Get yourself out of the echo chamber.

41:31.800 --> 41:35.800
Look for diverse perspectives among the scientists and engineers

41:35.800 --> 41:38.800
and welcome bad news.

41:38.800 --> 41:41.800
If everybody tells you the same thing you want to hear,

41:41.800 --> 41:44.800
that's not very good at all.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.800
Paul Simon wrote 60 years ago almost,

41:47.800 --> 41:50.800
man, here's what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.

41:50.800 --> 41:55.800
So look for that diversity of perspective opinion.

41:55.800 --> 42:00.800
And finally, don't misrepresent the science to justify a decision.

42:00.800 --> 42:05.800
Make that balance that I talked about at the beginning explicit.

42:05.800 --> 42:09.800
Yes, on the one hand, on the other hand, and so on.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.800
Having been a scientist most of my life

42:12.800 --> 42:15.800
and only gotten involved in policy matters,

42:15.800 --> 42:18.800
I would say in the last 20 years,

42:18.800 --> 42:23.800
I at one point heard the phrase science-informed policy.

42:23.800 --> 42:26.800
And I thought when I heard it, well, of course,

42:26.800 --> 42:29.800
what other kind of policy is there?

42:29.800 --> 42:33.800
And then I discovered that you often see in climate issues

42:33.800 --> 42:36.800
policy-informed science,

42:36.800 --> 42:39.800
namely that the description of the science

42:39.800 --> 42:44.800
is meant to conform to what policy makers would like to have happen.

42:44.800 --> 42:47.800
So I leave you with those general thoughts

42:47.800 --> 42:51.800
and welcome any comments or questions that you might have.
