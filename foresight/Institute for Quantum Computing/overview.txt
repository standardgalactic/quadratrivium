1. The protocol for Quantum Energy Transfer (QET) involves entangling a qubit with a field using an interaction that is spread out over space and occurs instantaneously in time. This creates an entangled state between the qubit and the field, which can be represented as a superposition of coherent states when not projected onto a specific basis.

2. The interference between different terms in the field expansion plays a crucial role in QET. When the energy is increased (cranked), the coherent states involved in the interference become wider, which generally reduces the effectiveness of the interference and hence the energy transfer.

3. In the original protocol, a qubit is sent from Alice to Bob, who then performs a unitary operation on the qubit. This operation involves displacing the field in the Z basis, leading to an energy exchange term that benefits from quantum interference.

4. To improve the efficiency of QET, especially as more energy is pumped into the system, the protocol was generalized to use multiple qubits (qudits). This uses Heisenberg-Weyl operators and a counter-rotating wave approximation, which introduces some non-locality but preserves a degree of locality that improves with distance.

5. A key consideration is Flanagan's theorem, which states that if the protocol were purely local, there would be an absolute bound on the energy output. By introducing non-local elements into the Hamiltonian in a controlled manner, the researchers have found a way to push this limit and potentially teleport as much energy as desired without significant cheating.

6. The researchers have performed parameter sweeps to find the optimal conditions for maximum energy transfer over long distances, ensuring that they remain within acceptable limits of locality. This approach allows them to circumvent the absolute bounds imposed by a purely local protocol and achieve significant energy transfer in a quantum entanglement context.
