1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Okay, so it's my understanding that was already a talk on quantum energy teleportation this

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,920
morning, so I won't introduce it too thoroughly, but this is joint work with Affium and Edu,

3
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,880
some of this is published and more work will appear in my soon-to-come thesis, hopefully.

4
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,880
Okay, so a review of quantum energy teleportation. We have Alice and Bob. You supply energy to Alice,

5
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,400
she makes a local measurement on a field in its vacuum, and if you mess with the vacuum,

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,880
you're going to inject energy, hence you inject local energy density here. When you do this

7
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,160
measurement, you get an output bit, you send that bit to Bob, and then Bob does a local unitary

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,040
in his region, depending on that bit, and if he does the right unitary, on average, he's going

9
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:14,080
to extract energy at point B, and hence do a negative energy density over here. So I'm just

10
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,320
going to go over again how this works intuitively in this talk a bit, and then show how this intuition

11
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,600
can lead us to developments. So an analogy for quantum field theory is a bunch of coupled

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,200
harmonic oscillators. If they're all in their ground state, then they wiggle around,

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,040
and if they're connected, then the wiggles are going to be correlated, and the further you are,

14
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,720
the less correlated you are. So to explain how we could exploit these correlations to

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,280
teleport energy, I'm going to take a little detour to analogy land in Quantum Casino,

16
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,760
where we play the quantum roulette, and the quantum roulette has a color and a number observable,

17
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,320
and usually it's a maximally mixed state, and if you bet on a certain outcome,

18
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,000
you can't really win on average, you know nothing. So well, even the casino rigs it so that you'd

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,120
lose on average. So let's say I have a maximally mixed state of roulette, on average I wouldn't

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,640
be able to win, but if I bet on something and I win, then my payoff is adjusted in terms of

21
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,800
kind of the spread of the probability distribution, or depending on my amount of uncertainty, so the

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,880
number observable has kind of a bigger entropy, and I get a bigger payoff because it's more rare

23
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,880
for me to win. But what if this maximal mixedness arises from maximal entanglement with another

24
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,600
neighboring roulette? What would you be able to do, for example? Well, let's say Bob knows about

25
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,720
this entanglement, but Alice doesn't. So Alice just plays the usual game, she bets on an outcome,

26
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,920
she loses on average, but she collapses the state onto a certain outcome. If Bob's able to peer over

27
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,960
to her table and say make out the color of the outcome, he could bet on the same thing,

28
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,840
right, and then get paid pretty much every time on average, if the correlations aren't 100% then

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,120
you know it's in statement on average, and of course if he could peer over and see the numbers

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,280
instead of the colors, then he could bet on that and get bigger payoff, but the numbers is,

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,320
it's more information he has to extract from Alice's table, right? So another thing,

32
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,400
classically correlated roulette would work if you try the same exercise. So basically what's

33
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,880
the key here is if you have mutual information. Mutual information is this quantity. Basically,

34
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:37,360
if I know a result at A, so if I condition B on A, then my entropy at B, my knowledge about B

35
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:44,960
gets better when I know stuff about A essentially, and that's what we use in quantum field theory

36
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,160
to teleport energy. So the analogies that the roulettes are like, you know, quantum fluctuations

37
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,160
in regions of the quantum field for Alice and Bob, and instead of money it's going to be energy,

38
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:04,160
right? So okay, so the usual QET protocol with quantum fields, the information carrier is just

39
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:10,880
a bit, and right that has a certain maximal amount of information content. So what if we use a QBIT,

40
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,600
you know, quantum spatter often? Well, that's also the same maximal amount of information.

41
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,560
And what about a QDIT? That's a higher dimensional Hilbert space, it has a bigger

42
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,040
possible entropy, more information content, more possibility to be entangled or correlated with

43
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,400
something else. So basically that was our work. We looked at, you know, QBITs as the information

44
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,240
carriers and the probes, and also QDITs and what happens when you send more and more information

45
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,400
per single shot of the protocol. And we had to devise a way to do this. So basically,

46
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,360
we were betting on the numbers instead of the colors in my analogy. So now it's going to get

47
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,640
more technical just because this is a specialist conference. Okay, so the ground state, you could

48
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:59,040
represent it as a superposition of a bunch of global field configurations, right? Just, you know,

49
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,680
functional expansion. And your two-point correlations, depending on the dimension,

50
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,720
they're going to decay with the distance to some power. And these fluctuations have a certain

51
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:16,240
variance. It's kind of gaussian in some sense. You all know this. Okay, so what do I want to do?

52
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,640
Well, let's say I have a bunch of possible global configurations. Well, locally, that gives me a

53
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:25,760
lot of uncertainty. I don't know which color it is, right? So, you know, if I do a measurement,

54
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,440
a local measurement at A and I collapse it to a certain palette of colors or whatever,

55
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,040
then that could be useful. And if I inform B about which subset of the possibilities I

56
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,760
collapsed it onto, then I reduced the local uncertainty at B, right? Entanglement, this

57
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,840
quantity is negative, so the mutual information is positive. So that's essentially what we're

58
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,040
going to try to do. And now I'm going to get into a bunch of unruly wits stuff. Not yet. All right.

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,960
Okay, just my notation. So a coherent state, basically, you don't really change the probability

60
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,880
distribution. You just displace it, right, by some bump, let's say. So it's the same probability

61
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,840
distribution. So that wouldn't be collapsing it onto a subset. So we can't just displace

62
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,840
the field. We've got to do something slightly fancier. Okay, so the interaction we used in

63
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,000
our paper, I'm going to run you through the qubit stuff, and then I'll just tell you how we general

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,320
as the qubits. It was this interaction, so instantaneous in time, spread out over space.

65
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,040
And then you look at the unitary. It's a coupling between a qubit and the field, obviously. It's

66
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:36,080
unruly wits like. So essentially what you get is a controlled unitary. You push the field up or

67
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,520
down with this distribution, depending on the state of the qubit in X. And then you get this

68
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,360
entangled state when you apply it to a spin-up state in the ground state, let's say. So you get

69
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,200
this entangled state. So it's entangled, well, as displayed here. And you could change that

70
00:06:53,200 --> 00:07:00,720
decomposition into a cat state in plus and minus Z. You just change the bases. So if you were to

71
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,080
project in the Z basis, you would collapse it onto one of these cat states. But in our protocol,

72
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,760
we just keep everything coherent and we don't necessarily project. So these cat states are

73
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:20,080
superpositions of coherent states. And what happens is in your field expansion, some terms

74
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,640
that were differing by just two lambda, you can make them interfere with each other a bit like

75
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,680
this, like the Wigner pseudo-probability distribution interferes. And that kills off some

76
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,400
possibilities. So you don't kill off a lot, but you kill off some measure. And the probability,

77
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,640
the amplitude of this cancellation is the interference term like this, and it's a Gaussian.

78
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Well, you see that if I crank the energy up, I spread these coherent states, you know, I

79
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,440
pump them bigger, then the interference lowers. That's not good. We want to input more energy and

80
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,760
output more energy. We want to turn the crank on QET. So I'll see how we get around to that.

81
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,160
For now, we have the qubit as the probe and the information carrier. And we just send the qubit

82
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,840
to Bob, as is. And then Bob does a control unitary in the Z basis of the same type. He

83
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,520
displaces it. And because of the two-point correlations, you get an energy exchange term

84
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,720
that has the quantum interference I talked about. And then this is like a two-point

85
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,600
correlator weighted by the energy. And then, of course, you have switching costs for Bob

86
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:28,560
of that counter, yeah. You pay some energy, just a couple. So that's the energy extracted.

87
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,240
But, you know, there's this interference term that's a problem. So what we did, we generalized

88
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,920
through QDITS. And so, okay, so QDITS, we use the Heisenberg-Weil operator, which are like

89
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:47,040
clock and shift operators. We expand the field operator. And then we do kind of a counter-rotating

90
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,880
wave approximation. And that has some non-localities, but I'll get to that in a second. And then we

91
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,400
use that. We use the same kind of couplings, X and Z, but Heisenberg, X and Z. And then the

92
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,960
coherence, basically, we want a better measurement. So the more, let's say, I pump in more energy,

93
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,480
I get a bigger radius for this kind of polygon, but then I could pack in more of these coherent

94
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,600
states to get more interference when I pump in more energy. The non-locality, well, there is

95
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,080
something called Flanagan's theorem that if you have a purely local protocol for QET, you have

96
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,880
an absolute bound on the energy output. And the fact that our counter-rotating wave Hamiltonian

97
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:31,040
introduces some degree of non-locality that decays pretty sharply compared to our teleported energy,

98
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,400
well, in some limit, far away, we're not cheating, right? We're recovering some degree

99
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:42,400
locality, and we still get a good amount of teleported energy. And then we found a limit,

100
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,200
okay. We found a limit pushing a bunch of parameters in a bunch of different ways.

101
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,760
We go very far away. We could teleport as much energy as we want without really cheating

102
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,360
considerably. And that's all the time we got, I think, so thanks.
