0	22000	Okay, so it's my understanding that was already a talk on quantum energy teleportation this
22000	27920	morning, so I won't introduce it too thoroughly, but this is joint work with Affium and Edu,
27920	32880	some of this is published and more work will appear in my soon-to-come thesis, hopefully.
34320	40880	Okay, so a review of quantum energy teleportation. We have Alice and Bob. You supply energy to Alice,
40880	46400	she makes a local measurement on a field in its vacuum, and if you mess with the vacuum,
46400	52880	you're going to inject energy, hence you inject local energy density here. When you do this
52880	58160	measurement, you get an output bit, you send that bit to Bob, and then Bob does a local unitary
58160	65040	in his region, depending on that bit, and if he does the right unitary, on average, he's going
65040	74080	to extract energy at point B, and hence do a negative energy density over here. So I'm just
74080	80320	going to go over again how this works intuitively in this talk a bit, and then show how this intuition
80320	85600	can lead us to developments. So an analogy for quantum field theory is a bunch of coupled
85600	89200	harmonic oscillators. If they're all in their ground state, then they wiggle around,
89200	93040	and if they're connected, then the wiggles are going to be correlated, and the further you are,
93040	98720	the less correlated you are. So to explain how we could exploit these correlations to
98720	105280	teleport energy, I'm going to take a little detour to analogy land in Quantum Casino,
105280	111760	where we play the quantum roulette, and the quantum roulette has a color and a number observable,
112480	118320	and usually it's a maximally mixed state, and if you bet on a certain outcome,
119040	124000	you can't really win on average, you know nothing. So well, even the casino rigs it so that you'd
124000	129120	lose on average. So let's say I have a maximally mixed state of roulette, on average I wouldn't
129120	134640	be able to win, but if I bet on something and I win, then my payoff is adjusted in terms of
134720	140800	kind of the spread of the probability distribution, or depending on my amount of uncertainty, so the
140800	144880	number observable has kind of a bigger entropy, and I get a bigger payoff because it's more rare
144880	150880	for me to win. But what if this maximal mixedness arises from maximal entanglement with another
150880	157600	neighboring roulette? What would you be able to do, for example? Well, let's say Bob knows about
157600	162720	this entanglement, but Alice doesn't. So Alice just plays the usual game, she bets on an outcome,
162720	169920	she loses on average, but she collapses the state onto a certain outcome. If Bob's able to peer over
169920	174960	to her table and say make out the color of the outcome, he could bet on the same thing,
176080	181840	right, and then get paid pretty much every time on average, if the correlations aren't 100% then
181840	187120	you know it's in statement on average, and of course if he could peer over and see the numbers
187120	191280	instead of the colors, then he could bet on that and get bigger payoff, but the numbers is,
191360	198320	it's more information he has to extract from Alice's table, right? So another thing,
198320	204400	classically correlated roulette would work if you try the same exercise. So basically what's
204400	210880	the key here is if you have mutual information. Mutual information is this quantity. Basically,
210880	217360	if I know a result at A, so if I condition B on A, then my entropy at B, my knowledge about B
218240	224960	gets better when I know stuff about A essentially, and that's what we use in quantum field theory
224960	230160	to teleport energy. So the analogies that the roulettes are like, you know, quantum fluctuations
230160	236160	in regions of the quantum field for Alice and Bob, and instead of money it's going to be energy,
236960	244160	right? So okay, so the usual QET protocol with quantum fields, the information carrier is just
244160	250880	a bit, and right that has a certain maximal amount of information content. So what if we use a QBIT,
250880	255600	you know, quantum spatter often? Well, that's also the same maximal amount of information.
256320	260560	And what about a QDIT? That's a higher dimensional Hilbert space, it has a bigger
260560	265040	possible entropy, more information content, more possibility to be entangled or correlated with
265040	270400	something else. So basically that was our work. We looked at, you know, QBITs as the information
270400	276240	carriers and the probes, and also QDITs and what happens when you send more and more information
276240	282400	per single shot of the protocol. And we had to devise a way to do this. So basically,
282400	287360	we were betting on the numbers instead of the colors in my analogy. So now it's going to get
287360	292640	more technical just because this is a specialist conference. Okay, so the ground state, you could
292640	299040	represent it as a superposition of a bunch of global field configurations, right? Just, you know,
299040	303680	functional expansion. And your two-point correlations, depending on the dimension,
303680	308720	they're going to decay with the distance to some power. And these fluctuations have a certain
308720	316240	variance. It's kind of gaussian in some sense. You all know this. Okay, so what do I want to do?
316240	320640	Well, let's say I have a bunch of possible global configurations. Well, locally, that gives me a
320640	325760	lot of uncertainty. I don't know which color it is, right? So, you know, if I do a measurement,
325760	329440	a local measurement at A and I collapse it to a certain palette of colors or whatever,
330880	337040	then that could be useful. And if I inform B about which subset of the possibilities I
337040	341760	collapsed it onto, then I reduced the local uncertainty at B, right? Entanglement, this
341760	345840	quantity is negative, so the mutual information is positive. So that's essentially what we're
345840	351040	going to try to do. And now I'm going to get into a bunch of unruly wits stuff. Not yet. All right.
352000	356960	Okay, just my notation. So a coherent state, basically, you don't really change the probability
356960	362880	distribution. You just displace it, right, by some bump, let's say. So it's the same probability
362880	367840	distribution. So that wouldn't be collapsing it onto a subset. So we can't just displace
368640	373840	the field. We've got to do something slightly fancier. Okay, so the interaction we used in
373840	378000	our paper, I'm going to run you through the qubit stuff, and then I'll just tell you how we general
378000	382320	as the qubits. It was this interaction, so instantaneous in time, spread out over space.
383760	389040	And then you look at the unitary. It's a coupling between a qubit and the field, obviously. It's
389040	396080	unruly wits like. So essentially what you get is a controlled unitary. You push the field up or
396080	401520	down with this distribution, depending on the state of the qubit in X. And then you get this
401520	407360	entangled state when you apply it to a spin-up state in the ground state, let's say. So you get
407360	413200	this entangled state. So it's entangled, well, as displayed here. And you could change that
413200	420720	decomposition into a cat state in plus and minus Z. You just change the bases. So if you were to
420720	426080	project in the Z basis, you would collapse it onto one of these cat states. But in our protocol,
426080	431760	we just keep everything coherent and we don't necessarily project. So these cat states are
431840	440080	superpositions of coherent states. And what happens is in your field expansion, some terms
440080	444640	that were differing by just two lambda, you can make them interfere with each other a bit like
444640	449680	this, like the Wigner pseudo-probability distribution interferes. And that kills off some
449680	456400	possibilities. So you don't kill off a lot, but you kill off some measure. And the probability,
456400	460640	the amplitude of this cancellation is the interference term like this, and it's a Gaussian.
460640	464640	Well, you see that if I crank the energy up, I spread these coherent states, you know, I
464640	469440	pump them bigger, then the interference lowers. That's not good. We want to input more energy and
469440	475760	output more energy. We want to turn the crank on QET. So I'll see how we get around to that.
476400	482160	For now, we have the qubit as the probe and the information carrier. And we just send the qubit
482160	487840	to Bob, as is. And then Bob does a control unitary in the Z basis of the same type. He
487840	493520	displaces it. And because of the two-point correlations, you get an energy exchange term
493520	496720	that has the quantum interference I talked about. And then this is like a two-point
496720	501600	correlator weighted by the energy. And then, of course, you have switching costs for Bob
501600	508560	of that counter, yeah. You pay some energy, just a couple. So that's the energy extracted.
509280	514240	But, you know, there's this interference term that's a problem. So what we did, we generalized
514320	521920	through QDITS. And so, okay, so QDITS, we use the Heisenberg-Weil operator, which are like
521920	527040	clock and shift operators. We expand the field operator. And then we do kind of a counter-rotating
527040	532880	wave approximation. And that has some non-localities, but I'll get to that in a second. And then we
532880	538400	use that. We use the same kind of couplings, X and Z, but Heisenberg, X and Z. And then the
538400	542960	coherence, basically, we want a better measurement. So the more, let's say, I pump in more energy,
542960	548480	I get a bigger radius for this kind of polygon, but then I could pack in more of these coherent
548480	553600	states to get more interference when I pump in more energy. The non-locality, well, there is
553600	558080	something called Flanagan's theorem that if you have a purely local protocol for QET, you have
558080	564880	an absolute bound on the energy output. And the fact that our counter-rotating wave Hamiltonian
564880	571040	introduces some degree of non-locality that decays pretty sharply compared to our teleported energy,
571120	576400	well, in some limit, far away, we're not cheating, right? We're recovering some degree
576400	582400	locality, and we still get a good amount of teleported energy. And then we found a limit,
583120	589200	okay. We found a limit pushing a bunch of parameters in a bunch of different ways.
589200	593760	We go very far away. We could teleport as much energy as we want without really cheating
593760	599360	considerably. And that's all the time we got, I think, so thanks.
