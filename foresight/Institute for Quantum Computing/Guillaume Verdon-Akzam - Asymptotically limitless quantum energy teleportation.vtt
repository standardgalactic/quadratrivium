00:00.000 --> 00:22.000
Okay, so it's my understanding that was already a talk on quantum energy teleportation this

00:22.000 --> 00:27.920
morning, so I won't introduce it too thoroughly, but this is joint work with Affium and Edu,

00:27.920 --> 00:32.880
some of this is published and more work will appear in my soon-to-come thesis, hopefully.

00:34.320 --> 00:40.880
Okay, so a review of quantum energy teleportation. We have Alice and Bob. You supply energy to Alice,

00:40.880 --> 00:46.400
she makes a local measurement on a field in its vacuum, and if you mess with the vacuum,

00:46.400 --> 00:52.880
you're going to inject energy, hence you inject local energy density here. When you do this

00:52.880 --> 00:58.160
measurement, you get an output bit, you send that bit to Bob, and then Bob does a local unitary

00:58.160 --> 01:05.040
in his region, depending on that bit, and if he does the right unitary, on average, he's going

01:05.040 --> 01:14.080
to extract energy at point B, and hence do a negative energy density over here. So I'm just

01:14.080 --> 01:20.320
going to go over again how this works intuitively in this talk a bit, and then show how this intuition

01:20.320 --> 01:25.600
can lead us to developments. So an analogy for quantum field theory is a bunch of coupled

01:25.600 --> 01:29.200
harmonic oscillators. If they're all in their ground state, then they wiggle around,

01:29.200 --> 01:33.040
and if they're connected, then the wiggles are going to be correlated, and the further you are,

01:33.040 --> 01:38.720
the less correlated you are. So to explain how we could exploit these correlations to

01:38.720 --> 01:45.280
teleport energy, I'm going to take a little detour to analogy land in Quantum Casino,

01:45.280 --> 01:51.760
where we play the quantum roulette, and the quantum roulette has a color and a number observable,

01:52.480 --> 01:58.320
and usually it's a maximally mixed state, and if you bet on a certain outcome,

01:59.040 --> 02:04.000
you can't really win on average, you know nothing. So well, even the casino rigs it so that you'd

02:04.000 --> 02:09.120
lose on average. So let's say I have a maximally mixed state of roulette, on average I wouldn't

02:09.120 --> 02:14.640
be able to win, but if I bet on something and I win, then my payoff is adjusted in terms of

02:14.720 --> 02:20.800
kind of the spread of the probability distribution, or depending on my amount of uncertainty, so the

02:20.800 --> 02:24.880
number observable has kind of a bigger entropy, and I get a bigger payoff because it's more rare

02:24.880 --> 02:30.880
for me to win. But what if this maximal mixedness arises from maximal entanglement with another

02:30.880 --> 02:37.600
neighboring roulette? What would you be able to do, for example? Well, let's say Bob knows about

02:37.600 --> 02:42.720
this entanglement, but Alice doesn't. So Alice just plays the usual game, she bets on an outcome,

02:42.720 --> 02:49.920
she loses on average, but she collapses the state onto a certain outcome. If Bob's able to peer over

02:49.920 --> 02:54.960
to her table and say make out the color of the outcome, he could bet on the same thing,

02:56.080 --> 03:01.840
right, and then get paid pretty much every time on average, if the correlations aren't 100% then

03:01.840 --> 03:07.120
you know it's in statement on average, and of course if he could peer over and see the numbers

03:07.120 --> 03:11.280
instead of the colors, then he could bet on that and get bigger payoff, but the numbers is,

03:11.360 --> 03:18.320
it's more information he has to extract from Alice's table, right? So another thing,

03:18.320 --> 03:24.400
classically correlated roulette would work if you try the same exercise. So basically what's

03:24.400 --> 03:30.880
the key here is if you have mutual information. Mutual information is this quantity. Basically,

03:30.880 --> 03:37.360
if I know a result at A, so if I condition B on A, then my entropy at B, my knowledge about B

03:38.240 --> 03:44.960
gets better when I know stuff about A essentially, and that's what we use in quantum field theory

03:44.960 --> 03:50.160
to teleport energy. So the analogies that the roulettes are like, you know, quantum fluctuations

03:50.160 --> 03:56.160
in regions of the quantum field for Alice and Bob, and instead of money it's going to be energy,

03:56.960 --> 04:04.160
right? So okay, so the usual QET protocol with quantum fields, the information carrier is just

04:04.160 --> 04:10.880
a bit, and right that has a certain maximal amount of information content. So what if we use a QBIT,

04:10.880 --> 04:15.600
you know, quantum spatter often? Well, that's also the same maximal amount of information.

04:16.320 --> 04:20.560
And what about a QDIT? That's a higher dimensional Hilbert space, it has a bigger

04:20.560 --> 04:25.040
possible entropy, more information content, more possibility to be entangled or correlated with

04:25.040 --> 04:30.400
something else. So basically that was our work. We looked at, you know, QBITs as the information

04:30.400 --> 04:36.240
carriers and the probes, and also QDITs and what happens when you send more and more information

04:36.240 --> 04:42.400
per single shot of the protocol. And we had to devise a way to do this. So basically,

04:42.400 --> 04:47.360
we were betting on the numbers instead of the colors in my analogy. So now it's going to get

04:47.360 --> 04:52.640
more technical just because this is a specialist conference. Okay, so the ground state, you could

04:52.640 --> 04:59.040
represent it as a superposition of a bunch of global field configurations, right? Just, you know,

04:59.040 --> 05:03.680
functional expansion. And your two-point correlations, depending on the dimension,

05:03.680 --> 05:08.720
they're going to decay with the distance to some power. And these fluctuations have a certain

05:08.720 --> 05:16.240
variance. It's kind of gaussian in some sense. You all know this. Okay, so what do I want to do?

05:16.240 --> 05:20.640
Well, let's say I have a bunch of possible global configurations. Well, locally, that gives me a

05:20.640 --> 05:25.760
lot of uncertainty. I don't know which color it is, right? So, you know, if I do a measurement,

05:25.760 --> 05:29.440
a local measurement at A and I collapse it to a certain palette of colors or whatever,

05:30.880 --> 05:37.040
then that could be useful. And if I inform B about which subset of the possibilities I

05:37.040 --> 05:41.760
collapsed it onto, then I reduced the local uncertainty at B, right? Entanglement, this

05:41.760 --> 05:45.840
quantity is negative, so the mutual information is positive. So that's essentially what we're

05:45.840 --> 05:51.040
going to try to do. And now I'm going to get into a bunch of unruly wits stuff. Not yet. All right.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.960
Okay, just my notation. So a coherent state, basically, you don't really change the probability

05:56.960 --> 06:02.880
distribution. You just displace it, right, by some bump, let's say. So it's the same probability

06:02.880 --> 06:07.840
distribution. So that wouldn't be collapsing it onto a subset. So we can't just displace

06:08.640 --> 06:13.840
the field. We've got to do something slightly fancier. Okay, so the interaction we used in

06:13.840 --> 06:18.000
our paper, I'm going to run you through the qubit stuff, and then I'll just tell you how we general

06:18.000 --> 06:22.320
as the qubits. It was this interaction, so instantaneous in time, spread out over space.

06:23.760 --> 06:29.040
And then you look at the unitary. It's a coupling between a qubit and the field, obviously. It's

06:29.040 --> 06:36.080
unruly wits like. So essentially what you get is a controlled unitary. You push the field up or

06:36.080 --> 06:41.520
down with this distribution, depending on the state of the qubit in X. And then you get this

06:41.520 --> 06:47.360
entangled state when you apply it to a spin-up state in the ground state, let's say. So you get

06:47.360 --> 06:53.200
this entangled state. So it's entangled, well, as displayed here. And you could change that

06:53.200 --> 07:00.720
decomposition into a cat state in plus and minus Z. You just change the bases. So if you were to

07:00.720 --> 07:06.080
project in the Z basis, you would collapse it onto one of these cat states. But in our protocol,

07:06.080 --> 07:11.760
we just keep everything coherent and we don't necessarily project. So these cat states are

07:11.840 --> 07:20.080
superpositions of coherent states. And what happens is in your field expansion, some terms

07:20.080 --> 07:24.640
that were differing by just two lambda, you can make them interfere with each other a bit like

07:24.640 --> 07:29.680
this, like the Wigner pseudo-probability distribution interferes. And that kills off some

07:29.680 --> 07:36.400
possibilities. So you don't kill off a lot, but you kill off some measure. And the probability,

07:36.400 --> 07:40.640
the amplitude of this cancellation is the interference term like this, and it's a Gaussian.

07:40.640 --> 07:44.640
Well, you see that if I crank the energy up, I spread these coherent states, you know, I

07:44.640 --> 07:49.440
pump them bigger, then the interference lowers. That's not good. We want to input more energy and

07:49.440 --> 07:55.760
output more energy. We want to turn the crank on QET. So I'll see how we get around to that.

07:56.400 --> 08:02.160
For now, we have the qubit as the probe and the information carrier. And we just send the qubit

08:02.160 --> 08:07.840
to Bob, as is. And then Bob does a control unitary in the Z basis of the same type. He

08:07.840 --> 08:13.520
displaces it. And because of the two-point correlations, you get an energy exchange term

08:13.520 --> 08:16.720
that has the quantum interference I talked about. And then this is like a two-point

08:16.720 --> 08:21.600
correlator weighted by the energy. And then, of course, you have switching costs for Bob

08:21.600 --> 08:28.560
of that counter, yeah. You pay some energy, just a couple. So that's the energy extracted.

08:29.280 --> 08:34.240
But, you know, there's this interference term that's a problem. So what we did, we generalized

08:34.320 --> 08:41.920
through QDITS. And so, okay, so QDITS, we use the Heisenberg-Weil operator, which are like

08:41.920 --> 08:47.040
clock and shift operators. We expand the field operator. And then we do kind of a counter-rotating

08:47.040 --> 08:52.880
wave approximation. And that has some non-localities, but I'll get to that in a second. And then we

08:52.880 --> 08:58.400
use that. We use the same kind of couplings, X and Z, but Heisenberg, X and Z. And then the

08:58.400 --> 09:02.960
coherence, basically, we want a better measurement. So the more, let's say, I pump in more energy,

09:02.960 --> 09:08.480
I get a bigger radius for this kind of polygon, but then I could pack in more of these coherent

09:08.480 --> 09:13.600
states to get more interference when I pump in more energy. The non-locality, well, there is

09:13.600 --> 09:18.080
something called Flanagan's theorem that if you have a purely local protocol for QET, you have

09:18.080 --> 09:24.880
an absolute bound on the energy output. And the fact that our counter-rotating wave Hamiltonian

09:24.880 --> 09:31.040
introduces some degree of non-locality that decays pretty sharply compared to our teleported energy,

09:31.120 --> 09:36.400
well, in some limit, far away, we're not cheating, right? We're recovering some degree

09:36.400 --> 09:42.400
locality, and we still get a good amount of teleported energy. And then we found a limit,

09:43.120 --> 09:49.200
okay. We found a limit pushing a bunch of parameters in a bunch of different ways.

09:49.200 --> 09:53.760
We go very far away. We could teleport as much energy as we want without really cheating

09:53.760 --> 09:59.360
considerably. And that's all the time we got, I think, so thanks.
