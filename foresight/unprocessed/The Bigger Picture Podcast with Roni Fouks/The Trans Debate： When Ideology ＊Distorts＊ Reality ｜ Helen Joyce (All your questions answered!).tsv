0	8560	Hello and welcome to the Bigger Picture podcast.
8560	15480	Today I have with me Helen Joyce, a journalist and the author of Trans, When Ideology Meets
15480	16480	Reality.
16480	18800	Helen, welcome to the show.
18800	20720	Thanks for having me on.
20720	22640	It's a pleasure to have you here.
22640	26960	This is a big topic and one that I've been thinking about quite a bit over the past
26960	31840	years so it's great to get a chance to finally talk about it on the show and with someone
31840	37640	who has done such amazing work uncovering the reality behind the trans movement and
37640	39400	its ideology.
39400	45480	And just as a comment, you know, I talk quite a bit about sex differences here on the podcast
45480	52160	mostly in the context of personal development and relationships and evolution behind these
52160	58040	differences because as far as I can tell, men and women are quite different in important
58040	60320	and somewhat predictable ways.
60320	65560	And I feel that the more we know about these differences, the better our lives will be
65560	67840	and the better our relationships will be.
67840	71600	But I haven't officially entered the trans debate so I'm looking forward to this.
71600	73080	Oh well, good luck.
73080	74080	Oh yes, exactly.
74080	75080	Good luck to us.
75080	76580	Here be dragons.
76580	77580	I'm ready for it.
77580	78840	I'm ready for it.
78840	84840	So in your book, you make the distinction between biological sex and gender identity.
84840	89840	And people listening might be thinking, what's the harm in letting people identify however
89840	90920	they please?
90920	92080	Live and let live.
92080	97760	And I understand how that would appeal to our internalized liberalism but you have so
97760	104400	beautifully shown that there are serious consequences when we try to bend reality and pretend that
104400	109120	someone's gender identity equals their biological sex.
109120	115240	So tell us Helen, why is a trans woman not in fact a woman?
115240	117160	Right, big question.
117160	119520	The whole question really isn't it?
119520	123800	And the terminology is incredibly confusing and I think that's deliberate but it's whether
123800	125760	or not it's deliberate, it's true.
125760	129400	So just for your listeners, a trans woman is a man who identifies as a woman.
129400	131840	About a quarter of people tend to think it's the other way round.
131840	134160	They think it's a woman who identifies as a man.
134160	137160	So when they hear trans women are women, they think to themselves of course trans women
137160	141160	are women because your identity doesn't change what you actually are.
141160	147120	But the claim is the reverse that a man can become a woman by saying he's a woman.
147120	148880	So that's the first thing.
148880	153280	And the second thing is it's right that we start from this liberal point of view.
153280	155680	I mean, I think all well-meaning people do.
155680	162000	We start with this position that other people have the right to feel how they like, identify
162000	166840	how they like, do what they like as long as it doesn't hurt other people.
166840	171360	And the thing about gender self-id, which is the short way of saying you are who you
171360	176760	say you are when it comes to which category you fall into, man or woman, is that it does
176760	178840	affect other people.
178840	183160	People often have this false analogy in their mind with, for example, gay rights.
183160	186840	And they think a gay person can tell you that they're gay and you wouldn't say no, you're
186840	191040	not, you're straight or well-proved to me that you're gay.
191040	192160	And there's two reasons for that.
192160	196400	One is because there is actually an objective reality behind being gay, like in the end
196400	200360	it does mean that you're going to fancy and end up with people who are the same sex as
200360	201360	you.
201360	204640	But the other reason is that apart from that person, who does it really affect?
204640	208800	It doesn't affect me as a straight woman in terms of my own relationships, that I have
208800	210720	one straight son and one gay son.
210720	212440	They'll end up with whoever they end up with.
212440	217000	And I fully expect that at some point I will welcome a daughter-in-law and a son-in-law
217000	219520	into my life, although I only have two boys.
219520	221320	So that's fine.
221320	228200	But this is different because in lots of places we have single-sex spaces and a person of
228200	233000	the wrong sex in a single-sex space, it's a bit like, I don't know what the American
233000	237240	equivalent is, I don't know, I know you don't call petrol, I think you call petrol gasoline.
237240	243000	But anyway, the two types of fuel for your car, we call them petrol and diesel, right?
243000	247520	And if you put petrol in a diesel engine, even a tiny bit of it, you destroy the whole tank
247520	250600	of petrol and you're going to have to go and get your car engine cleaned out.
250600	252800	And same the other way round.
252800	256440	And the person of the wrong sex in a single-sex space is like that.
256440	259280	They break the single-sex space, just one of them.
259280	264520	So if one man claims that he identifies as a woman and uses that claim to go into a space
264520	269920	that's meant only for women, it's like a tiny little bit of petrol in a diesel engine.
269920	272040	You've destroyed the whole thing.
272040	275880	And that's not to say that men are bad and women are good or vice versa, it's the same
275960	280040	as there are two types of fuel and they're both fine, it just depends which engine you have.
280040	284200	So the statement that a man can become a woman by saying he's a woman, if he's just
284200	287280	saying it at home himself in his own mind, who cares?
287280	291880	But actually, he's saying something that wrecks things for half of the population,
291880	296160	because he's saying something that would entitle him to come into spaces that he ruins by his
296160	300520	presence in the same way that petrol would ruin a diesel engine.
300520	303360	I mean, it's a sort of homely analogy, but I hope people see what I mean because I'm
303360	305520	not saying that men are bad.
305560	310280	People think you're saying, oh, this person's bad, they're a rapist, they're perverted.
310280	311320	I don't say any of those things.
311320	313160	They're perfectly nice people.
313160	315440	They're just not in the right place.
315440	321200	So to sum all of that up, a person's identity claim can't override the physical reality
321200	325520	when it comes to other people's needs and perceptions and so on.
325520	330320	And I skimmed right past there, what's the difference between sex and gender?
330320	334000	So sex is that those two of them were mammals, we evolved.
334080	337360	Like every other mammal in the world, we only come in two types, male and female,
337360	340040	and it's not possible to change which one you are.
340040	343960	The question of which one you are is an absolutely solely physical one.
343960	347960	It's to do which type of body, with which type of body you have.
347960	350160	Again, not one better than the other.
350160	352640	There just are two, and that's the way it is.
352640	357720	Gender is this like kind of multi-meaning word that different people mean different things by,
357720	362040	like maybe it means your masculinity and femininity.
362080	364920	Maybe it means something that you feel inside yourself,
364920	367960	like religious people feel that they have a soul or a connection with God
367960	372800	or that they've had a revealed truth about something like being born again
372800	374680	or living after death or something like that.
374680	378960	You know, there are claims that matter a lot to people, but don't matter really to other people.
378960	382160	So to the extent that gender is a word that's even worth using,
382160	384600	I don't because it's just got too many different meanings.
384600	389160	It's very personal and not something that should be imposed on other people at all.
389200	393480	It's our sex that matters when it comes to other people's perceptions and needs.
393480	401680	I think this term, gender, understanding the history of it, can help clear this issue up.
401680	408880	Can you tell us a little bit about where did this term come from and what made it so popular?
408880	411960	Yeah, I mean, lots of different bits to that story, really.
411960	416040	It wasn't a word that was often used for people's sex until relatively recently,
416040	421320	and I really think that the main reason it got picked up was that people didn't want to say the word sex.
421320	427200	Americans more than Europeans, because Americans tend to be more pretty about your language than we are.
427200	431640	But also, it's actually an ambiguous word, sometimes sex,
431640	434560	in that we also say sex for sexual intercourse.
434560	438640	So for example, in the context of a school, it would be a very bad idea to have a questionnaire
438640	442600	that you handed out that said, what sex are you or just sex?
442640	446480	And then the kids write in, yes, please, or lots of it or something like that.
446480	449720	Like you're just asking for trouble if you put sex in some questionnaires.
449720	453080	So people tend to use the word gender when they mean sex.
453080	456280	And that's still the most common use of the word gender.
456280	460680	But the word gender is also used by feminists and has been for over half a century
460680	464200	to describe the sort of impositions on the two sexes.
464200	466720	So there are, I mean, as you said at the beginning, quite right of course,
466720	470640	there are on average differences between men as a group and women as a group
470680	477320	in terms of interests, some strengths and weaknesses in psychological profiles.
477320	480400	And those things have very obvious evolutionary roots.
480400	483800	They are, again, just, you know, on average and men and women overlap a lot.
483800	486040	You could call that gender if you wanted.
486040	490000	Or you could say that gender is the thing that's imposed on us by things like,
490000	494880	oh, pink as a girl, color blue as a boy, color and men are leaders,
494880	498640	women are handmaidens to those leaders, those sorts of things like the prison,
499080	501440	actually, that the two sexes get put in.
501440	504600	And that makes it so hard to be so-called gender non-conforming
504600	507800	if you end up being a boy who cries easily and likes hugging
507800	510400	and doesn't want to play rugby and would like to play the harp.
510400	514440	Or you're a girl who absolutely hates wearing bows and frilly dresses
514440	517360	and thinks rugby looks like a great sport for you, you know?
517360	522720	So that's another meaning of gender, like the sort of imposition on the two sexes.
522720	527680	And actually the imposition that positions men is better than women, like superior.
528720	532680	And then one more meaning would be what you think you are yourself.
532680	535880	And that's a meaning that was only really started,
535880	540200	and I think about the 1980s, 90s in fringe parts of academia,
540200	543800	the idea that what made you, like that everybody had this inner sense
543800	547360	of whether they were a man or a woman, which might or might not be the same
547360	549240	as actually the fact of them being a man or a woman.
549240	551800	And you could think of that as an identity.
551800	555640	And since then, we've only accelerated on this path towards what you might call
555640	559040	the identitarianism, the idea that the most important thing about us
559040	564320	is our self-chosen labels, whether you label yourself as being a person of color,
564320	566240	like which is sort of, you know, it's a factual thing,
566240	570720	but it's also a self-chosen label if you're a mixed race, to some extent, at least.
570720	574080	And whether you label yourself as being of a certain religion,
574080	577120	how you think about your national identity, you know,
577120	582840	people tend to think about things like autism or ASD now as identitarian labels,
582840	586280	like whether you think of yourself as a member of the ASD community,
586280	590560	but in particular, your gender identity as another self-chosen label.
590560	594440	And you could think of that as a part of a very long-run shift
594440	602080	away from identity factors that are and have a lot of connection to other people,
602080	604920	things like the membership of your church,
604920	607960	the membership of a local community that you were born in, grew up in and would
607960	613160	expect to die in, your family, your larger family ties,
613160	616120	a workplace that you expected to stay in for decades,
616120	619800	a profession that you had for your entire adult life.
619800	624040	Those sorts of identities, as we become more fluid and mobile globally,
624040	629880	are taking second or even third place behind very self-chosen labels,
629880	635000	as I say, like things to do with mental illness or neurological differences,
635000	640240	as well as sexuality, gender,
640240	646520	maybe attachment to some slightly fringe ideas that you can find online about religion,
646520	650360	like not just mainstream church that you actually go to every week and that you work in,
650360	656120	but, you know, slightly cultish on occasion, ideas.
656120	660520	Right, right. So there's a few problems here that I'm hearing.
660520	665320	One of them is this very subjective sense of identity,
665320	671560	the fact that we think that our identity has to do only with our internal subjective feeling.
671560	677880	And in reality, we are very social animals, we cannot exist without others,
677880	685080	and our identity needs to somewhat be negotiated with our tribe and with other people.
685080	691960	So this shift into the entirely subjective, I find problematic.
691960	697160	And the second thing that I'm hearing is there is this paradox
697160	702680	with gender and what people call gender stereotypes and gender roles.
702680	707240	On the one hand, we're hearing that gender is completely fluid, right?
707240	712600	There are no two genders we can identify however we want,
712600	720920	you know, on a whim, depending on the day. But trans people really try to emulate
721640	728600	the gender stereotype of their choosing. They are trying to
730200	737000	be and embody that gender stereotype. So there's this contradiction in the ideology itself.
737000	743880	And I'll just mention, I love that you added in your book a Jungian friend that you have,
743880	750040	a Jungian therapist, where she says that it is very problematic to turn the abstract
750040	759160	into concrete. And yes, there are elements of our personalities that we might find masculine
759160	764840	or we might find feminine. As you have mentioned in other interviews,
764840	769800	you have a PhD in mathematics, which is something that might be considered
769800	776680	typically masculine. I know that I am a pretty disagreeable person, which is also a masculine
776680	783800	trait. But that doesn't affect my gender in the slightest. So tell us a little bit about this
783800	791560	paradox around gender and stereotypes. Yeah, I mean, this whole topic is filled with
791640	797560	contradictions. I mean, for example, you're told that gender is fluid, and that there is no
798520	803080	characteristic that you can point to that tells you what somebody's gender is,
803080	806920	except that they just told it to you. And this is related, by the way, to a sort of
806920	813400	post truth ideology where everyone creates their own truths. Yes. And anything that is imposed on
813400	818920	you is seen as an imposition, like a bad thing. But I mean, lots of things are just irreducibly
818920	824840	true. I mean, I would love to be immortal. But the reality of human life is that I am going to die.
824840	828600	I think a lot of this is actually a sort of childish, almost toddlerish
829320	834520	tantrum against the fact that there are many things that are given and that we can't change.
835160	838360	Well said. Yeah. So that's not good for any of us.
839240	843000	Lisa Marchano is the name of the therapist you're thinking about. She's a Jungian psychotherapist
843000	847560	who's extremely knowledgeable about gender and gender identity. And she said to me when I talked
847560	852040	to her, she's she's a wonderful woman. And, you know, I really highly recommend people looking into
852040	856920	her work, generally, but also specifically on gender. She said to me that when she found out
856920	861720	about this first, like a lot of people, it was around 2015. And she noticed it with friends
862440	866600	saying, you know, such and such is coming out as trans. And like a lot of us, she thought,
866600	870440	Oh, you know, this is this is lovely. This is wonderful. These kids are playing with something.
870440	874840	And she also, if I remember correctly, she has studied history and trained as a social worker
874840	880360	in her past. So she has three really relevant bits of information here. So one is, you know,
880360	884280	something about psychic contagions, because that's a Jungian concept, but also it's something
884280	889800	that's happened through the history of medicine. Two, she's quite alert to the fact that children
889800	894040	are very suggestible and need grown ups to set boundaries to help them to be safe and to understand
894040	899240	the world and to navigate the path to adulthood. And three, she's a Jungian. So she thinks a lot
899240	905320	about the power of the symbolic and how important symbols can be as the first part of the furniture
905320	910600	of our mind. So she thought that when, and in particular, so a young also talked about the
910600	915400	animus and the animal, which are like male and the female animating soul type concepts,
915400	918520	it's not something I've thought about much in my own life or that I would regard as particularly
918520	924200	helpful. But for her, it's a way of thinking about dark and light, masculine and feminine,
924200	929160	you know, as constant balancing things that play and shift. And in any one person,
929160	932760	you're going to have bits of both and maybe more of one than the other. But you could also,
932760	938520	in therapy, think in a very playful way about how you as a woman might think about your masculine
938520	944760	side or, you know, vice versa and that that might change over time. And so she thought that's what
944760	948760	these kids were doing. She thought, Oh, how lovely they're playing. And then she found out they were
948760	954920	getting mastectomies. And to her, that was immediately, Oh, you're concrete concretizing
954920	962120	the symbolic. And Jung understood that in a very profound way to be extremely dangerous,
962120	967240	that somebody would would take these playful symbolic concepts that, you know, are so useful
967240	973160	when you're thinking about growing as a human being, and then draw them on your body in the same way
973160	980520	that, you know, an anorexic turns self hatred or fear of adulthood, or a desire to take a
980520	984200	blessed space in the world or something on their bodies that acted out there. That's what these
984200	988760	kids are doing. They're acting something out on their bodies. And so she flipped in a second when
988760	993000	she said that when she heard that, where it's for most of us, it takes a bit longer, I think,
993000	999640	to think through it. But so then you've got this person who is expressing something very real to
999640	1004920	them, which is that in some sense, they don't feel like their own sex. Talk about what those
1004920	1010360	feelings might be where their origin is how they would differ between men and women, girls and boys.
1010360	1015800	But anyway, you've got a person who is saying to you, I'm not really a girl or I'm not really a boy,
1015800	1023240	aren't the opposite sex or identity sex. This is a very meaningful statement. It's not a true
1023240	1027960	statement in the concrete world where our mammalian bodies live. But it may be a true
1027960	1033720	psychological statement that you then need to unpack. And that distinction between the two is
1033720	1039000	the problem. But you've also got a person who is trying to express that to everybody else. And
1039000	1043800	this this comes to your stereotypes question. Like, first of all, the stereotype may be the
1043800	1048200	reason why I've got this idea in their heads, if they feel they aren't living up to a stereotype
1048200	1051640	that they think is very important, like a boy thinks he's not going to be manly enough,
1052280	1057480	or a girl thinks that, you know, girls are giggling creatures, you know, like wearing push-up
1057480	1062200	bras and having nape extensions and ironing their waist length hair every morning. And, you know,
1062200	1066600	actually, is the sort of person that you see in the really grotesque porn that's very common
1066600	1071720	in schools now, like boys show girls porn, you know, as a way of bullying them, for example.
1071720	1076760	Oh, God. So if you're a girl who thinks that you can't live up to the feminine stereotype,
1076760	1079800	which is an impossible stereotype, incredibly thin with big tits,
1080520	1084600	you know, very virginal, but at the same time puts out all of those things that we've always
1084600	1089320	known about femininity, how impossible it is, then you think you must be masculine, but now
1089320	1094680	you're going to have to try and show that to other people. Now, an actual boy doesn't have to act
1094680	1099320	very masculine to show people that he's a boy, because everyone can see he's a boy. But a girl
1099320	1103000	who wants other people to think that she's a boy is going to have to act in stereotypically
1103000	1106600	masculine ways, otherwise they just won't know what she's going on about, and vice versa.
1107720	1112440	So, I mean, I'm a middle-aged woman and, you know, feminine, am I masculine? At this point,
1112440	1116920	I don't care. As long as I get my HRT, I'm happy, you know? But I do some feminine things,
1116920	1121000	like I don't bother cutting my hair. I grow it long. I'm wearing a floral top.
1123480	1127640	I'm a mother. That's a pretty feminine thing to be, I suppose, as you say, other PhD in
1127640	1132520	mathematics. But anyway, I don't have to do anything, because the fact that my face was
1132520	1138040	shaped by estrogen, and my body was shaped by estrogen, do it all for me. I could go out in
1138040	1143080	a paper bag and people would know that I'm a one. But if I had been along the male developmental
1143080	1147880	pathway, nobody would know that I thought I was a woman. So, you're going to have to wear the signs,
1147880	1153880	outward signs of being a woman, to try to override the fact that you're just not, and that people
1153880	1160120	can see that. And this leads people to very stereotyped self-presentation and performance.
1160120	1164280	And then the final thing, which I hope we do get to talk on in more detail, is that sometimes the
1164280	1170120	stereotype is the appeal. Like a lot of the middle-aged men who identify as women, they get
1170120	1176600	turned on by acting feminine stereotypes. Yeah, so we will get into that. That is an interesting
1176600	1184840	one. Absolutely. Absolutely. So this, I think, does help clarify why they are so married to the
1184840	1193480	stereotype. And just as an aside, I do very much like Carl Jung in his thinking. And I don't buy
1193480	1198200	the fact that gender stereotypes are stereotypes. I think they're archetypes. I think they're
1198200	1205720	evolved just like estrogen evolved females and testosterone evolved males. And the fact that
1205720	1212760	certain things we perceive automatically, it's almost like a heuristic as masculine or feminine,
1212760	1219000	I think that's also evolved. And obviously, there are cultural flavors and, you know, one
1219000	1225240	culture might consider dancing as very feminine. And another culture only men do that. But still,
1225240	1230920	there are certain things that, for instance, thinking that nurturing is something feminine.
1230920	1237240	That is not made up. And that is not a patriarchal lie. That is because women bear children and they
1237240	1244520	breastfeed. And they have this built in maternal instinct. So also changing some of the language
1244520	1250840	around stereotypes, we do have a lot of freedom in how we express our roles today, which I think is
1250840	1259320	amazing. But understanding what femininity and masculinity is in our psyches, these built in
1259320	1266280	features, I think is also important because pretending like nothing is feminine, nothing is
1266280	1273160	masculine, we can be whatever we want. And then playing out the stereotypes, I think gets us into
1273160	1279320	such confusion. And it's just not helpful. If I could come back on that a bit, I agree with
1279320	1286360	everything you said. And that is why I don't count myself as what some, in particular, some radical
1286360	1291800	feminists. So for listeners, radical in radical feminist does not mean extreme. It means going
1291800	1296360	back to the root. Radical is a word that comes from root. So it's a specific school of feminism.
1296360	1301640	And I don't count myself as a member of that because radical feminists are also gender abolitionists.
1301720	1306680	They believe that in a world where women weren't oppressed, there would be no gender stereotypes
1306680	1312280	or of any sort. I completely agree with you that many things that we call stereotypes are archetypes
1312280	1316760	and that these are things that clearly evolved. Obviously, women are going to be more interested
1316760	1322920	in babies than men. This just like how could that not be? Evolution does not leave. There's a famous
1322920	1328120	joke about an economist as somebody who would walk past a dollar bill left on the sidewalk and not
1328120	1333400	pick it up. And if you asked him why, he'd say, you know, no dollar bills get left on sidewalks,
1333400	1338280	someone must already have picked it up. So evolution is like that. Evolution doesn't leave
1338280	1345480	dollar bills on sidewalks. Anyway, what I would say, though, is that what is harmful and very
1345480	1352840	destructive about gender and not are given is hierarchy in it. And this is a point that was
1352840	1357560	made to me beautifully some years ago by Jane Clare Jones, who's a philosopher here in the UK.
1357560	1362760	And she was the person who showed me that in a lot of these things, the bad isn't in difference.
1362760	1368520	The bad is in turning that difference first into a binary. So it's very extreme rather than thinking
1368520	1373400	that people are mixtures and they vary and it's overlapping, and then saying that one is better
1373400	1378760	than the other. So if you think of masculine and feminine and you think of words to pair with that,
1379400	1385880	you will hear that masculine is light and feminine is dark. Masculine is the sun, feminine is the
1385880	1393480	moon. Masculine is Yin, feminine is Yang. And in every case, the masculine is the animation force,
1394200	1401080	the active force, and feminine is the passive force. And those linked binaries need to be
1401080	1405800	unpicked if women are to be full human beings. It doesn't mean that we can't be feminine,
1405800	1409240	but to the extent that feminine means being object rather than subject,
1410120	1414760	and being passive rather than active, being the servant rather than the master,
1415640	1419400	and being the follower rather than the leader, you know, women want to do all of those things too.
1419400	1425000	We want to live full and actualized lives too. While we're more interested in babies,
1425000	1428680	while we speak more maybe, while we're better communicators, maybe while we don't have such
1428680	1433960	good 3D vision, you know, why we probably don't make good firefighters in the main but are better
1433960	1440760	nurses in the main than men, you know. So, because we've done this stupid thing of over exaggerating
1440760	1446280	what masculine and feminine are, lying to ourselves about the fact that we have put a value judgment
1446280	1450200	on how the two of them relate to each other, and then pretending that it's all stereotyped
1450200	1454440	and none of it is real, we haven't even started the work of unpicking any of this that we could have done.
1455400	1461080	Absolutely, absolutely. I think that is so beautifully said, because it really is that
1461080	1468280	superiority and inferiority complex, right, the fact that we perceive masculinity as positive,
1468280	1475160	and the fact that feminists, their solution to that was to become more like men instead of
1475160	1483080	raising the value of feminine virtues and things like, you know, raising children or, you know,
1483080	1490680	being nurturing of valuing that, as you said, there are value judgments here, and yes, we have
1490680	1499880	evolved in a somewhat patriarchal world, but unpicking these gender archetypes doesn't mean
1499880	1506360	that we need to abolish gender. So, I really, really loved how you put that. So, let's talk a
1506360	1514680	little bit about gender dysphoria. What has the research shown about kids who have gender dysphoria
1514680	1519960	and were left alone? So, gender dysphoria, the word dysphoria just means discomfort or misery.
1520520	1526600	So, it's a discomfort or misery with either the fact of which sex you are or the stacks of the
1526600	1532360	sexed body that you have. And the diagnostic tools have changed over time and the labels have changed,
1532360	1537080	but basically, it's a boy who's deeply unhappy in more than just a passing sense, the fact that he's
1537080	1541720	a boy, perhaps he hates his penis, perhaps he hates the role that he's supposed to play as a boy,
1542360	1548760	whatever, you know, and the same for girl, like the reverse. So, this is something that,
1548760	1555720	to some extent, probably, through recent history, most girls are felt because most girls find
1555720	1559960	puberty really very difficult. Bleeding is starting to bleed as tough when you have your period.
1559960	1565400	Breasts are the most visible outer remarker of being an adult woman, and as soon as your
1565400	1568040	breasts start to develop, which is usually when you're only in your early teens,
1568600	1572120	that's when you start to get catcalled and men give you unwanted attention. So, you could say
1572120	1577320	that gender dysphoria is an incredibly natural thing, at mild to moderate. And, you know, lots
1577400	1581800	of boys, like, if you're going to grow 18 inches in about half a second and your voice breaks and
1581800	1586280	you become very, very spotty, that's also deeply depressing. So, puberty is perhaps a time that
1586280	1592680	a lot of people feel some of the element of gender dysphoria. But what you didn't ever really see
1592680	1598200	until very recently was significant numbers of younger kids strongly expressing that they
1598200	1605160	didn't want to be their sex, or teenagers who said, much more than just, you know,
1605160	1608920	it's so unfair that I have to bleed, or why do I have to stay at home while the boys get
1608920	1612920	up to go out and play? Like, why do I have to help with housework? You know, to go beyond that into
1612920	1616920	saying, I feel like I'm a member of the opposite sex, I was meant to be a member of the opposite
1616920	1621800	sex, I really am a member of the opposite sex. That's not an idea that spontaneously occurs to
1621800	1628040	many people. So, at that long preamble, it has occurred to some children in history. And there
1628040	1633880	are, I think, 13 studies that I know all before the big change that happened in the last decade or
1633880	1638840	so, which will come to that have looked at those kids. And they're in different countries, some
1638840	1644120	of them are boys only, some of them mixed sex, some of them are rather small. All of them show
1644120	1650680	that those kids outgrow their gender dysphoria if you don't concretize it. So if the family are
1650680	1654840	kind to the child, try to understand what it is the kid is saying when they say, I'm not really
1654840	1660360	a boy or I'm not really a girl, give them time, don't lie to them about their bodies, don't lie to
1660360	1665640	other people about what sex they are, they grow out of it. And interestingly, a very large share
1665640	1672600	of them turn out to be gay. So the fixed understanding by, say, 2010, among those who knew
1672600	1678840	the research was that little children who expressed spontaneously the idea that they were meant to
1678840	1683880	be members of the opposite sex in whatever language they used were highly likely to grow up to be gay,
1683880	1689560	but would also grow out of their gender dysphoria. And this is connected with an idea we all used
1689560	1694280	to know, which is that gay people are by far the most gender nonconforming people. And that gender
1694280	1698920	nonconformity often comes way before puberty. So before the gay person knows they're going to be
1698920	1705240	gay, before they feel any, you know, feelings of sexual attraction, they are unusual, they are
1705240	1709880	different, you can spot these little fey boys sometimes, and these incredibly rough and tumble
1709880	1715080	girls. Of course, some of them grow up to be straight, but just the odds chain when a kid is
1715080	1720920	like that. Right, right. So that's what we knew in about 2010. And there have been some studies
1720920	1725560	since that have confirmed that. But what has happened since then, two things. One is that we
1725560	1731880	are creating gender dysphoria. And the other is taking that gender dysphoria to mean that you
1731880	1736360	are trans and that you should do quite extreme things in terms of your self presentation and
1736360	1746120	medical treatment. So by telling people that if you feel that if you don't identify with
1746760	1753240	the most extreme and rigid and un-nuanced description of what it is to be a boy or a girl,
1753800	1757800	then you probably aren't a boy or a girl. And that's basically what's being taught right across
1757800	1762200	the Anglosphere and increasing numbers of non-English speaking European countries as well.
1762200	1767960	That they're literally telling girls and boys in school from quite little that it's possible
1767960	1772680	to look like a boy but really be a girl or vice versa, and that there are people who have a gender
1772680	1776280	identity that doesn't match their body. How are you going to know what your gender identity is
1776280	1783480	when you self-examine and you do so by reference to just incredibly regressive stereotypes? So,
1783480	1788200	I mean, I'm not talking about, you know, it's unsurprising that girls like babies more than
1788200	1794280	boys do. I'm talking about girls like cooking and pink and knitting and shopping and gossiping
1794840	1799560	and boys like trucks and rugby and like they literally write these lists down and they tell
1799560	1804440	children to look at them and self-examine. So that Zinnikid looks and thinks, oh, you know,
1804440	1809240	I don't really fit in that and actually it sounds a bit shit. Maybe I'm non-binary or I like the
1809240	1813080	look of the other lists better or whatever. And then they're told that makes them trans.
1813960	1817560	And so now you've got a kid who's thinking about something that a child wasn't thinking about in
1817560	1821880	previous eras. Like, they just weren't encouraged to think about it and encouraging people to
1821880	1827800	ruminate about something creates a chain in how they think and how they feel. It's a feedback loop.
1828360	1831480	And over time, you know, pretty much anyone can convince themselves that they're gender
1831480	1836360	dysphoric if they give it a really good go. And then the next thing that you're told is you're
1836360	1842040	given a cultural meaning for what it is to be trans that says you must declare your pronouns.
1842040	1846120	Anyone who won't use your pronoun hates you and wants you dead. I mean, imagine a more
1846120	1850920	wicked thing to tell a child than that anyone who slips up and looks at an obvious girl and
1850920	1855160	forgets that that girl calls herself a boy, that that person is hateful and wants them dead.
1856280	1860600	And then that child gets paranoid about it. They ruminate. They feel afraid. They close in.
1860600	1864360	They go into their bubble of people who agree with this incredibly extreme ideology.
1865720	1870360	And then they may self-medicate or they may seek medication or they go and see a gender
1870360	1875320	affirmative therapist who tells them this is the right interpretation. And if they're very unlucky,
1875320	1880840	they end up on drugs and that they can't be undone. You know, what you take changes your
1880840	1886280	body permanently. And maybe even on the way to surgery, whereas in a culture that understood
1886280	1889640	gender nonconformity, something wrong with it, gender nonconforming, some people are a lot
1889640	1895800	gender nonconforming. That's fine. We can accommodate all sorts here. You know, what do you mean when
1895800	1899640	you say you're really a girl? Then, you know, Jimmy, do you mean you want to go to ballet because
1899640	1904200	you can go to ballet? You know, that sort of approach. Yeah, in that culture, Jimmy would just
1904200	1907640	have gone to ballet. It would have been fine. And he might have grown up gay. Or he might have
1907640	1912600	given up ballet. Who knows? In our culture, Jimmy is unfortunately being pushed down a much more
1912600	1918760	dangerous and harmful path. And so it's hard to say what the research shows as something that
1918760	1923160	it would show now because the research dates from a time that we weren't creating gender dysphoria
1923160	1927640	and we weren't putting children on this pathway. Now that we are creating gender dysphoria and we
1927640	1932200	are putting children on this pathway, we're probably creating a lot of children who will grow
1932200	1937400	up to be adults who continue just to identify as trans and we don't know what happens next.
1937400	1942040	Will they be happy for the rest of their lives with these changes? Will they live a happier life
1942040	1945720	for spending their whole lives trying to tell everybody else they're not really the sex they
1945720	1950040	clearly are? How will they feel about the fact that if they've undergone these physical, these
1950040	1956040	hormonal and surgical changes, they'll be sterile and probably an orgasmic as well? You know, it's a
1956040	1961880	huge uncontrolled, not even experiment because we're not tracking the outcomes. Right, right.
1961880	1966920	I want to zoom in here because I think it's so important for people to understand
1966920	1973000	what actually goes on in these gender clinics. When we talk about gender affirmation,
1973000	1979960	I just want people to understand that that is the accepted policy today. If you're in a progressive
1980520	1988440	state in America, I know in the UK and in Ireland, this is very much the case in many places,
1989080	1996760	gender affirmation is the way to go. And I've heard this very cruel phrase that is being
1996760	2003320	thrown at parents. Would you rather have a trans child or a dead child? And I cannot think of
2003320	2010760	anything more cruel to say to a parent who is confused once their child to be happy
2011720	2019160	sees that their child is suffering and is seeking the advice of a clinician, of someone who is
2020360	2027320	certified and has worked and researched this field. And what they are being fed is a very,
2027320	2034280	very dangerous ideology that distorts reality. It's a collective social delusion. And the
2034280	2040280	consequences, the physical consequences are dire. And I recently had a conversation
2041400	2048280	talking about these problems. What happens? What do you do when you have a child,
2048280	2056760	four years old, five years old, who's gender nonconforming? I think understanding that we
2056760	2063000	live in a very liberal world and if you want to go to ballet, Jimmy, go to ballet. I love that.
2063080	2069240	I was in karate and kung fu classes for years because I could not stand the girls in ballet
2069240	2078200	class. And no gender dysphoria here, but I liked rough and tumble play with the boys.
2078200	2086200	And there was nothing wrong with that. And I think that this idea that we are telling children
2086360	2093640	that they can change their sex is wrong. It is false because what they really can do
2093640	2100360	is they can sterilize themselves. They can turn themselves into asexual beings. If you
2100360	2109080	take puberty blockers, your reproductive system isn't going to develop and even your sexual desire
2109080	2114360	isn't going to develop. A lot of these people are asexual, have experienced sexual dysfunction
2114360	2124920	and these surgeries are, I can't find another word other than they create a disabled person.
2124920	2132120	They have a high risk of infection, of complications. You need to take hormones for the rest of your
2132120	2141480	life. You don't actually change into the other sex. You undergo this genital mutilation,
2141480	2148760	this really awful process. So tell us a little bit about what happens in these gender clinics.
2149880	2153480	I mean, everything you say is true. And as you were saying, as I was thinking about little Jimmy
2153480	2157480	and him saying that he wants to go to ballet, and it comes back to the point I made earlier
2157480	2161480	about the hierarchy between masculine and feminine, because you were doing a high status
2161480	2165960	thing as a little girl doing karate. You were rejecting the low status thing, namely the girl
2165960	2171000	thing, whereas a boy who wants to do ballet is very counter cultural. So that's a much harder
2171000	2176040	task for parents to find space for a little Jimmy who wants to do ballet without him starting to
2176040	2179720	internalize the fact he's not a real boy, that the other boys are going to mock him. They're
2179720	2184120	going to say that's a girl thing to do, you're a girly, you're a sissy, you know, all of those things.
2185080	2190360	And I mean, it depends where you are. You know, if you're in a liberal city, if you live in Brighton
2190360	2196120	or New York, you probably, you know, there's space for that kid, but you're going to have to make
2196120	2200920	that space for them as a parent. And that's a really important thing to do. And if you think
2200920	2207000	we can't do it, then ask yourself what homophobia you are still harboring, because we all know
2207000	2211080	that little Jimmy who wants to do ballet is more likely to grow up gay, and people who don't want
2211080	2216040	them to do ballet, because they know that they wrongly think that they can change Jimmy's or
2216040	2221640	suppress Jimmy's future sexual orientation by forcing Jimmy to go and do some much more manly
2221640	2227480	things instead. All they can do is make Jimmy very unhappy. Okay, right. So so that's a harder task,
2227560	2233160	find a holding space for those useful little fey, little special boys may grow up to be
2233160	2237720	straight and fabulous. And that's fine. But let's all face it, they're more likely to be gay.
2238440	2243160	Right. So what happens when you go to a gender affirming clinic, which in more and more countries
2243160	2247400	is the only sort of way that a therapist is allowed to practice because of laws against
2247400	2254440	they call conversion therapy, is that as soon as a child says, I understand myself to be trans in
2254440	2259560	any form of words you might imagine, I feel on gender queer, I feel on gender fluid, I think I'm
2259560	2264600	non binary, I know that I was really meant to be a boy, any of those words, all they hear is,
2265240	2272040	you're right. It's back to this thin identity that is just so created and self stated, rather
2272040	2274920	than being something that's actually about the connection that you have with other people.
2276200	2283800	And then that is affirmed, you know, a good therapist affirms the situation that their
2283800	2287640	client feels themselves to be in affirms their feelings by saying, I can I hear that you can
2287640	2291000	feel like that you're feeling that I hear this is important to you, let's unpack it.
2292120	2296680	Gender affirmation is no, you really are a boy. That's right. You know, a girl who says she's a
2296680	2302200	boy really is a boy. No questioning. And then that just sort of pushes the child down a certain
2302200	2307320	pathway. And anyone who disagrees with them, including the parents is positioned as somebody
2307320	2312360	who hates that child wants that child dead. And I've heard too many stories to repeat now about
2312360	2318680	therapists meeting a child for the first time and saying to that child in front of the parents,
2319400	2323000	you know, yes, you are what you say you are and anyone who disagrees with you and you need
2323000	2326840	puberty blockers or else you'll kill yourself, like telling the children, coaching them in
2326840	2332920	suicide, this really is happen. And so instead of helping, they're harming. I mean, I would not
2332920	2337000	under any circumstances bring a child that I've had anything to do with it anywhere near any of
2337000	2341000	these people, because they will only make it worse, which of course leaves you on your own.
2341080	2345880	And on your own against a culture that is telling your child lies in school curricula,
2345880	2352680	in reading materials, online, in government edicts. So you're really on your own. I think
2352680	2357240	more than parents have ever been before about trying to deal with a societally created problem.
2358040	2363000	It's worth talking a little bit about the way that this gender affirmation has become standard.
2363800	2370040	I mean, really, until 10 years ago, any reputable therapist knew very well that, you know, you don't
2370040	2375400	just affirm as in blindly say it's true to things that your clients say, you don't tell them it's
2375400	2379560	false necessarily either. It's generally a, you know, what does this mean to you? Let's talk about
2379560	2385400	it. Let's get to the root of this. And it's been by a false analogy with conversion therapy
2385400	2391880	practiced on gay people a half a century ago. So the theory used to be that being gay was
2391880	2396040	something that had gone wrong in your development was always blamed on the mother. I mean, mothers are
2396120	2399720	the universal punching bag for everything that goes wrong with children.
2399720	2400280	Since Friday, right?
2400280	2405400	And the idea was, yeah, yeah. So the idea was that the mother had been too clingy or the father
2405400	2409080	had been too absent and therefore the mother had been too present and that she had imposed
2409080	2414200	femininity on her son. And that the boy had somehow become, had flipped somehow. He was an
2414200	2418760	invert. He had gone down the wrong pathway and that you could maybe put him back on the right
2418760	2423800	pathway. And the ways in which they tried to do this, by the way, completely false, but also
2423800	2429000	the way they tried to do it was very cruel, which was that you would try to get a gay person,
2429000	2432920	so a teenager or even a little boy. I've heard it's been done in little boys who were just very
2432920	2438920	gender nonconforming. And you would try to get them to feel shame about anything that was gender
2438920	2446600	nonconforming, like you would throw out the little boys and dress up clothes, you would get the adult
2446600	2452520	to shame themselves about their feelings. If it was an adult, you might get them to what
2452600	2457960	opposite sex porn and masturbate at the same time, you would get them to watch a bit same sex
2457960	2462520	images like to be a handsome man, if it was a gay man, you're trying to convert and give them at
2462520	2466760	the same time electric shocks or give him and drugs that would make him feel sick and vomit.
2467560	2472760	And all you can do by doing this sort of thing is internalize a great deal of shame and also
2473800	2477640	make the person associate their natural feelings of desire for an older person
2478600	2483400	with revulsion. It is actually possible to suppress people, temporarily to suppress people's
2483400	2488120	natural desires. What you can do is create the desire that they don't have, you know,
2488120	2492520	all you can do is really make them very, very miserable. So that was conversion therapy and no
2492520	2498760	therapist has done it for a decade. It was recognized to be abusive. All the psychological
2498760	2504040	associations and similar worldwide put out statements apologizing for ever having suggested
2504040	2508680	that this was a good idea, saying it didn't work, saying that doing anything remotely like this
2508680	2513400	would get you struck off. The only place that anything even remotely similar still happens
2513400	2519960	is in sort of fringe religious groups. And there you might get shamed in front of other people
2519960	2525400	or prayed over or be subjected to sort of hours of haranguing. And this again is really fringe,
2525400	2529960	like really, really fringe. And anything that heads into that you might be hit or anything
2530040	2534680	that that would of course fall under and assault laws, like it will be illegal without ever having
2534680	2540760	to say you need to have a specialist law about it. But anyway, in the last few years, activists
2540760	2547320	have managed to get laws they call bans on conversion therapy past around the world. We're
2547320	2553640	fighting to try to stop one here in the UK. And what they say is conversion therapy for,
2553640	2559160	and this is the big bait and switch, sexual orientation and gender identity. Now,
2559160	2562440	if it was just sexual orientation, it would be a law banning something that basically isn't
2562440	2566920	happening. And that's annoying and bad. But anyway, you know, it's relatively minor because
2566920	2571880	it's not really happening. But gender identity, as I said, it's not this fixed thing. Most people
2571880	2575160	don't feel themselves to have to have a gender identity, they just know that they're male or
2575160	2580200	female. And people who think of themselves as having a cross gender identity, at least in childhood,
2580760	2586360	we know that tends to vanish, if you just let it alone. So there isn't a fixed thing gender
2586360	2590920	identity that you would be trying to convert somebody from the way there is a sexual orientation.
2591720	2597240	And what this plays out as is that anybody who tries to make any sort of effort to convince
2597240	2604120	somebody that they're not whatever they say they are at risks of criminal prosecution,
2604120	2607800	it depends on the law, the specific law, if they're a therapist, they might get struck off.
2608440	2612520	And they might get sued by somebody if it's even a parent in some places. I mean, there have been
2612520	2618360	parents who had children taken away from them in both Canada and in the US, for refusing to allow
2618360	2625240	the child to go on puberty blockers, because that's seen as a conversion effort. So this law is an
2625240	2630520	absolute wolf in sheep's clothing. It's an attempt to stop anybody from saying to a child, you know,
2630520	2636680	hang on, what do you actually mean when you say you're not actually a girl? And to just railroad
2636760	2643400	this child's straight through this entirely ideologically driven, non reality based model
2643400	2652360	of whatever you say you are, you are. This is so sinister, you know, putting this into a law and
2653160	2660280	taking a parent's right away from them to be a parent, to deal with their children however
2660280	2667560	they see fit. And to protect them from these ideologies, it's absolutely absurd. And I think
2667560	2673400	the problem is that most people just don't have the time to follow, you know, these policies,
2673400	2679240	these laws. And it's really important to know the facts behind this. It sounds so nice as well,
2679240	2683800	you know, it sounds so great ban conversion therapy. Yeah, I know. And then you look at
2683800	2688760	it and it's not what it says it is. Exactly, exactly. Wolf in sheep's clothing, as you said,
2688760	2695640	that's really well put. I want us to talk a little bit about the types of transgender
2695640	2703000	isms, because we like to think of it as one big category. But really, there are types and there
2703000	2709720	has been good research showing that there are types. So tell us a little bit about these categories.
2709720	2715400	Sure. So the very first people who ever had any idea that somebody could be a man but really a
2715480	2722600	woman were in about 1920s. And it was very linked to their understanding of homosexuality,
2722600	2726360	like these early researchers and going back a little bit earlier than that about 30 years earlier
2726360	2731560	than that on homosexuality, their idea of what a homosexual man was was a man with a woman's soul.
2732120	2735000	That's what they really thought that you were inside, you were really a woman.
2736520	2742840	But by about 1920s in Berlin, specifically, there were just a couple of doctors who felt
2742840	2747960	that it was possible not just to be a man with a woman's soul who wanted to sleep with men,
2747960	2751960	but that you might be a man with a woman's soul in a way that made you want to present as a woman.
2751960	2757640	So they saw it as a type of cross dressing. And if you look at the early work, their early writing
2757640	2761160	about it, they understood that it was different whether the man wanted to sleep with men or
2761160	2764360	wanted to sleep with women. So they understood right from the beginning that there were two
2764360	2769480	types of men who might think of themselves as women or want to sleep, like take the woman's
2769480	2773400	role in sex, you might call it. And that was the gay ones and the straight ones.
2774120	2780120	So those are the two types still that we think of. If you're any sort of serious sexologist who
2780120	2786040	isn't entirely had your brain eaten by identity and identity politics and queer theory, you still
2786040	2790920	understand that there are these two types of men who feel that they're women. And there's
2790920	2796840	entirely different paths to it. So for the gay men, it'll be somebody who is a really gender
2796840	2802360	nonconforming little boy. And it was established really 20 years ago by in a research paper that
2802360	2806520	looked at all the previous research about how gender dysphoria developed in children.
2807640	2812120	And what it concluded was you started with the gender nonconformity. Child didn't typically feel
2812120	2818760	gender dysphoric. Shame followed because of the way that the gender nonconformity was
2818760	2822920	responded to by the people around you. So a dad who tried to toughen you up,
2823800	2828120	and, you know, classmates bullying you and leaving you angst and calling you a sissy,
2828120	2835080	and so on, that creates enormous shame in a boy who is different. And that shame becomes
2835080	2840600	self-patriot. And then at some point the question occurs to the little boy, was I really meant to
2840600	2845080	be a girl? And that's the origin of that sort of gender dysphoria. And somebody who goes along
2845080	2851960	that classic pathway, ideally what'll happen when they hit puberty is sexual desire rears its head
2851960	2855560	and they finally understand themselves to be gay. And then, you know, this is not an easy path to
2855560	2859800	adulthood when you're shamed with who you are and you maybe live in a homophobic society.
2860440	2865560	But anyway, a load of gay men of my generation and above have had to navigate that path and they
2865560	2870280	understand themselves to be gay and they have done a lot of work on themselves to get rid of the
2870280	2875560	shame. But some haven't and some can't. And in the end they feel that they just be happier and more
2875560	2881880	natural. They present as women. And so these people typically tend to be very feminine in their
2882120	2888120	presentation and style and always have been, pass quite well often, and are quite realistic
2888120	2894760	actually. They know they're not women and they don't tend to want to impose on women. I don't think
2894760	2899480	any man belongs in women's spaces but these men because they're gay are not actually a massive
2899480	2904600	threat to women. And that's what most people think that all trans men are, like all trans-identified
2904600	2908280	men, all trans women, they think that they think that it's a gay man who's had a lot of surgery
2908360	2913400	and is really unusually, you know, feminine. But they're probably the minority who've been
2913400	2919160	seen in gender clinics over the last number of decades. The majority come in older. They're
2919160	2925160	heterosexual. They've often been married and have kids and they're often very notably not very feminine
2925160	2929480	in their self-presentation. They're quite hard charging men. Typically they've done things like
2929480	2934120	engineering, computer science. There's a lot of them in the military. And these men have something
2934200	2940440	more complicated which is that they get aroused at the idea of being a woman. So they like women,
2940440	2945400	not men, but the woman they like best is the imaginary woman that they are. And those men
2945400	2949400	have typically been cross-dressings as they were teens. It often starts by stealing your sisters
2949400	2954600	or your mother's underwear and masturbating in it. And those men often conceal the fact that that's
2954600	2960440	how they get their thrills. They get married, they have kids maybe, and then at some point their
2960440	2966680	wife finds out that their husband is wearing their dresses. And this is a big part of his life.
2966680	2971480	And often what happens is this man makes it to his forties or fifties. And by this point,
2971480	2975960	you know, he's conquered everything else. He's maybe cruising towards retirement and it's time
2975960	2981720	for the woman inside to come out and play. Right, like Caitlyn Jenner is a great example of this.
2982360	2985000	Yeah, I mean, I don't want to diagnose somebody that I don't know. But I mean,
2985960	2989640	it does look pretty typical. So if you imagine Caitlyn Jenner, you're probably imagining
2989640	2993720	the right thing. But I don't know Caitlyn Jenner and I'm not a psychological professional.
2994280	3004040	So that person is often somebody who, like, their dearest wish is to really be a woman.
3004040	3009480	And the thing that's different about this from homosexual orientation is that it requires
3009480	3014120	other people to play along. So the gay man says to me, I'm gay. And I say, no, you're not.
3014680	3017800	Like he goes, oh, yes, I am. But I don't care what you think.
3018680	3023320	If a man who says he's a woman says to me, he's a woman. And I say, no, you're not.
3024040	3028440	I'm destroying his deepest fantasy. Right. And if I say to him, no, you can't come into this
3028440	3032600	space because this space is women only. I'm stopping him from living out something that he's
3032600	3037400	been fantasizing about possibly for decades. And remember, he's a man, he's got male entitlement.
3038280	3041640	He's somebody who thinks that he gets what he wants. And this is the latest thing that he wants.
3041640	3047000	And so these men are hyper aggressive. So if you want to think about the nastiest and most
3047000	3053960	entitled, aggressive woman hating, and just horrible trans activists, and of course,
3053960	3056840	there are plenty of trans people who are not like this. But if you want to think about the
3056840	3062440	ones who cause the most problem, it's these men. And that is because the one word they will not
3062440	3068760	hear from women is. And I'll say one more thing about these men. It's that part of the fantasy
3068760	3073560	for them is that they would have been much happier if they hadn't gone through male puberty,
3073560	3076920	because they don't pass. They've, you know, they're in their 40s, they're trying to transition now,
3076920	3080360	they've got deep voices, they've got big jaws, they've big hands and feet, they're tall.
3081240	3086200	They've got the whole body of a man. It's too late to send them down the other pathway.
3087240	3091400	And it's a source of grace grief to them that they can't pass. And it's a big part of what they
3091400	3098360	fantasize about. So they project that fantasy, boys, and they think that they often sort of,
3098360	3102200	you know, retrofit their history. They'll say things to you like, I knew I was a girl right
3102200	3106120	from when I was little. And you're like, well, I mean, there wasn't any evidence at the time.
3107000	3111160	You didn't act very feminine. And you did get girl to get married and have two kids or whatever.
3113080	3118040	So but the fact that they project that on little boys and they are biggest cheerleaders for very
3118040	3123320	early medicalization of gender dysphoria kids. And they are not interested in the fact that most
3123320	3127320	of those kids will grow out of it. They want those kids put on puberty blockers before puberty
3127320	3131560	starts. They want those they want to lower the ages, kids can get cross sex hormones.
3131560	3137160	They want surgery done even before 18, because it's part of their own sexual fantasy. And they
3137160	3141400	don't care about the fact that actually the biggest group seen in gender clinics now are girls,
3141400	3145160	who aren't even part of this damn profile. And we didn't even start talking about the girls,
3145160	3151960	like we just talked about the boys. The girls, the girls is a whole other issue. And just to
3151960	3157800	give people a little context, this is new. Transgenderism has usually been seen in men
3158360	3167400	with androphilic men who are homosexual and do want to be women, but with men and the auto
3167400	3174840	gynephilia, men who are attracted almost to themselves really as women and have this fantasy,
3174840	3182440	as you said, of being women. But teenage girls being gender dysphoric is completely new. And
3182440	3189480	we we hinted at it at the beginning with this social contagion. So give us a little context.
3189480	3195080	What is happening to teenage girls today? So Abigail Shrier wrote a book that was very
3195080	3199320	specifically about these girls called Irreversible Damage. And in it, she said that she had tried
3199320	3204440	to find papers, the earliest papers, academic papers that covered gender dysphoria and teenage
3204440	3209320	girls, and she couldn't find a single one before 2010. It literally wasn't a phenomenon. There
3209320	3213560	were there was none. Almost no children were seen in gender clinics. And when they were,
3213560	3219640	it was really invariably boys or nearly invariably boys. You did see some women in gender clinics
3219640	3225880	early, but they were variably like really hyper butch lesbians who just found that they just
3225880	3229400	wanted to be taken from men, they wanted rid of their breasts, they wanted to marry a woman,
3229400	3233720	they wanted to live in first commas live like men, like they just they just didn't want anyone to
3233720	3238520	think of them as women. And often they could pass because if you testosterone is like a one-way
3238520	3242200	gait, it's like, you know, it's like they say easily in but not easily out. So the mobster in the
3242200	3246840	lobster pot, you know, testosterone testosterone is that. So someone who's gone through male
3246840	3251480	puberty is never going to pass as a woman without extensive surgery, including on their face,
3252360	3257240	and probably not even then. But a woman, even a woman who's gone through female puberty, if she
3257240	3262360	takes testosterone, she'll grow facial hair, she'll bulk up on her muscles. She may have
3262440	3267720	looser hair if she carries the gene from male patterned baldness. She's got a much better chance
3267720	3271720	of passing as a man. So that was what they used to see in gender clinics, the occasional lesbian
3271720	3277240	woman who came in and wanted testosterone and to have her breasts removed. Never saw teenage girls
3277240	3283000	and never saw gender conforming women either. So what happened? I mean, you could say the internet
3283000	3290040	happened, Tumblr happened. Teenage girls have always been the group most susceptible to social
3290040	3297320	contagion. Right, I mean, I generally am on the fence about to what extent that's something real
3297320	3304040	about teenage girls psychology or to what extent it is. The fact that female puberty is really hard
3304040	3310440	to navigate when our ideas of what a girl is are so unattainable. But it's girls who got anorexia,
3310440	3316920	anorexia much more than boys, it's girls who self harm, who cut, who do bulimia, like vomit.
3317000	3321960	It's girls now who are on TikTok, identifying as having multiple personalities. These things
3321960	3326440	just really spread through groups of girls in a way that they don't groups of boys or mixed sex
3326440	3332920	groups. And the sad fact is that since 2010, the cultural contagion among girls has been
3332920	3339480	trans identification. And what really facilitated this and made it the cultural contagion of
3340120	3346600	time is the internet and specifically internet sites where children congregate without adults.
3346920	3352120	This is unprecedented in human history, that there has been a very serious and large social
3352120	3357880	space where only children are and where there are no adults. We have let our children raise
3357880	3364920	themselves and each other in places like Tumblr and now TikTok. And children are more volatile,
3364920	3369880	less experienced, worse at weighing risks, obviously much more naive because they have much
3369880	3376440	less life experience. And if you leave them in places where there's nobody older and more
3376440	3382520	experienced and willing to say no, they really spiral off into oddities. And so you started
3382520	3387640	to see around by 2013 to 2015 on Tumblr, these questionnaires about, you know, identify your
3387640	3392280	gender and it would be like, it was like, it was like, bloody Tamagotchi or Pokemon, you know,
3392280	3399880	like, got to catch them all lists, random, you know, unicorn gender, and very febrile.
3400840	3405880	And there were no adults. So I think it was Lisa Littman, who is the woman who
3407000	3412120	coined the phrase rapid onset gender dysphoria for these girls. She found out about it the
3412120	3417240	way that many people did by friends telling her about trans issues or seeing things on Facebook.
3417240	3420840	And at first she thought like everybody else, you know, how lovely they must have been accepted.
3421720	3427240	And then she had a training, a background in epidemiology. So she was used to thinking about
3427240	3432520	rates of things. And after she saw about the third or fourth child, all teenage girls come out in her
3432520	3437160	relatively small community, she thought this is realistic, like I'm told that the rate of
3437160	3443960	trans identification in girls is 120,000. So I'm not going to see four of them in rapid succession
3443960	3448440	in one community. So she started to look into it and she went and she looked on Tumblr and she
3448440	3453800	sent what she saw horrified her. It was children giving the worst possible advice to each other,
3453800	3458360	girls saying things like, if you think you might be trans, you really are.
3459160	3463800	And if you tell your parents and they say anything that's not affirmative, they hate you,
3463800	3468440	they want you dead, you should cut yourself off immediately. You'll find better advice here than
3468440	3474280	you find if you go to the doctor, doctors are ignorant, you know, really awfully damaging things.
3475160	3479960	And we've never ever created a space like that before. It's as if we've got the worst possible
3479960	3483720	thing that these teenage girls could do and tell each other and we put them in a gated community
3483720	3488360	where no adults come in and we've let them go for many years on this sort of thing.
3489000	3495400	Like Tumblr cracked down on sites glorifying and posts glorifying anorexia and self-harming.
3495960	3501480	They were really bad and suicide as well. But it never cracked down on the gender stuff and
3502600	3507080	spawned an entire generation's contagion and now it's all moved to Tik Tok where honestly
3507720	3511880	the amount of gender-related bullshit and if you try to say anything sense, you lose your account.
3512680	3519160	Wow. Wow. No, that is incredible. I want to give people a little glimpse into the psychology here
3519160	3525720	of the teenage girl because I find it really fascinating. First of all, in puberty, puberty
3525720	3532360	is it easy for anybody, but girls definitely have a harder time, society's expectations, period.
3533000	3540440	All of these things are difficult, but women also have a rise in eroticism during those years.
3540440	3548520	So that heightened negative emotion also sets the stage. And I heard an interview with a girl
3548520	3554600	who transitioned and then detransitioned. I forgot her name. I think it's something Cole.
3555240	3561320	She was on- Chloe Cole, that big Chloe Cole. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Wonderful, wonderful interview
3561320	3566840	with Jordan Peterson. I really recommend it. And what you find out there is that she
3567560	3577160	had fantasies of becoming a woman, a vivacious, voluptuous, Kim Kardashian type woman. And she
3577160	3582840	found later on that she she's a bit autistic. She's on the spectrum. So that also clues us
3582840	3588120	into the fact that she wasn't good at reading social cues and she didn't get along with girls
3588120	3594280	because of that. She had a harder time with with girls and feminine typical things.
3595320	3603160	And people who are autistic do tend to like things more than people. So you have this gender
3603160	3610200	non-conforming kind of till and you have these fantasies of becoming a woman and you have this
3610200	3615880	awkward stage of puberty. And God, I remember it. You know, everything grows at the wrong
3616440	3622520	pace and the wrong rate and you see all of these Victoria's Secret models and, you know,
3622520	3631240	I'm never going to be like that. And her solution then, reading Tumblr, was maybe I need to be a boy.
3631880	3640440	And I won't go into too much detail about the horrific things she underwent and the consequences
3640440	3648280	and the symptoms. But it really is devastating. And when you realize that at the heart of it was
3648280	3656120	truly a fantasy of being a woman. And her only solution was this trans ideology that she was
3656120	3666200	fed. So definitely needs more thought and more care and get your teenage girls away from social
3666200	3670760	media. And something that I should say, and I haven't heard other people say this, so maybe it's
3670760	3675320	a good time to discuss it. I think anyone who is immersed in this topic knows how dangerous
3675320	3680520	Tumblr was and that TikTok is an absolute cesspit at the moment. What you may not know is that fan
3680520	3686040	fiction websites are a big inculcator of this stuff. Interesting. So yeah, so there's two
3686040	3691560	big fanfic websites that I know about and I'm just really interested in them. There are a window into
3691560	3695800	the mind of teenage girls and young women. Others thought we don't have anywhere else,
3695800	3701000	because the way they work is they're unmediated. As long as you don't make copyright claims,
3701000	3705160	pretty much anything goes. And there's literally millions of stories on the two big ones,
3705160	3709480	Archive of Our Own and fanfiction.net. There are other ones as well. But literally millions,
3709480	3715400	I think there's more than 10 million on Archive of Our Own. And they tend to start from a story
3715400	3719800	that pre-exists, although there are some that are original. Harry Potter is very, very popular,
3719800	3724120	because Harry Potter was established at the right stage. The kids who grew up with Harry Potter
3724120	3729160	arrived at the right age to want to write fanfic. And you start by saying to yourself,
3729160	3733960	like, what happened next? What happened after Voldemort was defeated? And there's, I think,
3733960	3738200	more than a million stories that follow on from Harry Potter just alone, but there's thousands
3738200	3745000	of fandoms. Anyway, so these are not edited and they are not gate kept in the way that, say,
3745080	3750360	erotic fiction or romance fiction or adventure fiction or anything young adult is. Like,
3750360	3754920	somebody has to publish that stuff. This stuff is just by girls, for girls, or young women.
3755640	3760920	And some of it's extremely good. But you can study it because you can sort things and you can
3760920	3764920	search by tags. And I've done a fair bit of that. I wrote an article about it just more than five
3764920	3769320	years ago and I went back to it to see what had changed. Very much more porny was one of the
3769320	3778440	big ones. Porn related tags like slapping, choking, spitting, anal, gang bang, those things had
3778440	3783480	really become much more common. So there's a horrible feedback loop between the porn, the
3783480	3790280	boys watch and the erotic stuff that girls write. But there's a lot of what's called slash fiction
3790280	3798120	there. So the slash is the punctuation sign. And it goes back decades to the fan fiction that was
3798120	3804840	written before the internet and published in fanzines about Star Trek. And it started with
3804840	3812520	being women writing about Captain Kirk and Spock getting together. And so it was Kirk slash Spock,
3813320	3819400	K slash S, just slash. So slash fiction is any fan fiction that is written about two
3819400	3826040	characters who in the original are heterosexual men getting it together. And this I think is the
3826040	3831640	female equivalent of men watching so-called lesbian porn. And so lesbian porn isn't about
3831640	3835640	lesbians. It's about the sort of woman who appeals to men, but there's two of them. And men will
3835640	3839320	commonly say, well, you know, you get rid of it, I don't like watching, which is the man, I don't
3839320	3843400	like seeing men, they're getting in the way, they're ruining my view. Two women are better than one,
3843400	3848280	you know, those sorts of things. So why do women like slash? I don't, by the way, myself. I find
3848280	3853480	it incredibly irritating, but lots and lots of women do. And they write stories. So when I was
3853560	3859880	writing about this, I think in 2017 or 18, the most popular pairing in the Harry fiction in Harry
3859880	3867240	Potter category on Archive of Our Own was Draco and Harry getting together. I know it's now,
3867240	3871560	I think that's second now. And the most common is Hermione and Harry. So that's overtakenness.
3871560	3877560	But anyway, so girls write a lot of fiction that gets two boys together. But then you look at what
3877560	3883320	they write. And yes, they are using porn tropes. And, you know, they learn from each other. And so
3883960	3889320	you know, things that are seen in gay porn do creep in. But you as you read it, if you do look at
3889320	3894920	it, they don't read like men. These men don't read like men and they don't read like gay men either.
3894920	3901240	And if you ask a gay man to read it, he thinks it's hysterical. These men are kind of womanly.
3902040	3905400	And the best way I can describe them is that they're like a Korean boy band.
3906360	3910840	So they're kind of huge and they and they hold hands and they talk about their feelings and
3910840	3916440	they may have sex that's written in a lot of detail. But they're kind of girls. And I genuinely
3916440	3922360	think that these bloody sites are selling girls an idea of what it is to be a gay boy that they
3922360	3927080	really like to look all. Because it used to be that it was only the very gender nonconforming
3927080	3930200	girls who were going, you know, going to grow up lesbian. They were the ones who transitioned.
3930200	3933320	And I mean, that's bad enough. But you kind of see where they're coming from. Like it's the
3933320	3938680	wrong solution, but you see what they're saying. But now it's these very feminine girls. And like
3938680	3943400	how what is a feminine girl thinks she's good. And she's so she wants to be a gay boy. And I
3943400	3948040	mean, I said, I have a gay son. Like, this is not this is a non-starter gay men aren't interested
3948040	3952280	in women. They really aren't even in women who have taken testosterone. But they're imagining
3952280	3959240	themselves to be this sort of Korean boy band aesthetic. And so they're, I don't know, it's
3959240	3964760	very strange. It's like a self coaching into a weird, cultish belief. And lots of girls are
3964760	3971640	doing this. It's really a collective delusion, what it sounds like. It's inverting reality completely
3971640	3979640	and allowing these girls to entertain, you know, the reality of, oh, I can I can be a boy and have
3979640	3984920	that romance that I really want. Yeah, just be this, yeah, and be this like holding hands type
3984920	3988760	of boy. And I'm not saying that gay boys don't hold hands, but you do know what I mean. If you
3988760	3993800	picture those Korean boy band boys, there's an expression in French that gets used in English
3993800	4000680	in crimes, which is fully other, which is like a madness of two. And it's crimes that are committed
4000680	4006040	by partners that you think would probably not be committed by only one of them. They egg each other
4006040	4011320	on and they end up committing even a murder together. So I think whatever the collective
4011320	4017240	equivalent of fully other is, this is a madness that gets created by large numbers. And again,
4017240	4022840	it's this unmediated space where there aren't adults, there isn't reality, there's no gay keeping.
4022840	4026440	And in some ways that's brilliant, it's super creative, like there's incredibly brilliant
4026440	4030280	ideas on these sites. You know, you could lose yourself there for years if you wanted,
4030280	4033640	but one of the things that happens there is that significant numbers of girls
4034280	4039080	develop gender dysphoria, create an idea of what it would be to be a gay boy or this
4039080	4044440	they sweet kind of girly variety, and then catastrophically take steps that can't be
4044520	4047960	undone. It doesn't end up just being a phase, like being a goth would have been a phase,
4047960	4050760	you know, like this was just got 2.0, I wouldn't care.
4051640	4057960	Right, right. I think they almost think that they can solve the problems that they're facing
4057960	4065000	as girls as developing women and get to enjoy, you know, all the good parts in this illusion.
4066200	4071160	Incredible, incredible. I've never heard of that. And, you know, I do, I know about kind
4071160	4076600	of fan fiction and fantasy from Euphoria, the TV show, there's one character who's like really
4076600	4084680	heavily into that kind of erotica, but I have not heard about this like weird boy on boy,
4084680	4089880	but imagined in a girl's mind kind of romance stories. Incredible.
4089880	4095880	Oh, my jaw dropped when I heard about it first. Like, I actually, I was, why did I hear about this?
4096600	4099400	I can't actually remember where I heard about it first. I had to go off and look it up.
4100200	4104520	And I actually sat there, I could feel my mouth go, what? But you know,
4104520	4108280	and when I wrote this article, like I looked into it, you know, there's been some scholarly work
4108280	4115080	done on early slash fiction. And I talked to a woman who had written a short book on Kirk slash
4115080	4120120	Spock. And she was really interesting talking to her about it. And when she decided she wanted
4120120	4126360	to research it, she reached out to a famous evolutionary psychologist who was retired.
4126360	4130760	And she quoted from his letter and replied to her in the foreword to her book.
4130760	4136680	And he said the same thing. He said he got her letter. She wrote what this was. She said that
4136680	4140280	I want to do some research on this, you know, would you consider supervising, I think was a
4140280	4145000	master's degree on it or something. And he said he sat there, he said my jaw dropped,
4145000	4149480	and I had to rewrite reread what she had written several times to make sure that I hadn't misunderstood
4149480	4153960	it. So if you're not one of the people who finds like, I promise you some of your listeners right
4153960	4160760	now are thinking, Oh, that sounds nice. And they haven't heard about it before, but they're going
4160760	4167080	to go and look. So they're all whatever floats your boat, whatever floats your boat. But these girls
4167080	4174680	madness of large numbers. And crazy, crazy, crazy. I again, keep your teenage daughters away from
4174680	4181640	social media the best you can have them rooted in reality, in real friendships and relationships.
4181640	4188280	I think that's a good course. I do want us to touch upon this issue that you have spoken about
4188280	4196600	as well, which is trans rights impinging on women's rights. And we see that in these extreme cases
4196600	4202280	of women's sports and women's prisons. So tell us about what is going on.
4203560	4208840	So I always try and unpack that statement, because I ask what, you know, what are trans rights?
4209560	4214520	If by trans rights, we meet the human rights that everybody has, you know, to freedom of
4214520	4222520	belief, freedom of expression, safety, dignity, to be able to work without prejudice and so on,
4222520	4226680	absolutely trans identified people have exactly the same rights as everybody else. And so they
4226680	4231400	should, you should not be able to fire somebody or refuse to rent them or kick them out of a bar
4231400	4237880	or any of those things like that. What the trans rights are human rights. And it's meant to me.
4238840	4245800	Is that unless you go along with a trans identified person's identity, their actual sex,
4245800	4249320	you are denying their human rights. And they will often say you're denying my right to exist.
4249960	4253720	Right. So a man who identifies as a woman is like what I said at the beginning of this show,
4253720	4258440	you know, he's petrol. She's diesel. They're both lovely. They're great. When you put them in the
4258440	4262680	right tanks, fantastic. When you put them in the wrong tank, they cause a big problem.
4263720	4267800	So if a man who identifies as a woman takes that as being that he can come into women in
4267800	4271560	these spaces, he destroys women only spaces, like just that's just a logical statement.
4271560	4275880	He's a man. So he comes into all in space. It's no longer a woman only space. And that
4275880	4279720	doesn't change if he calls himself a woman, because we can't actually turn men into women.
4279720	4286120	Like he thinks of himself as a woman, but he's not. So it's a problem for all women only spaces
4286120	4290840	actually like even the ordinary ones. You have to ask yourself why we have women only spaces in
4290840	4297080	the first place. And it's always basically comfort, safety, privacy, privacy and dignity.
4298040	4304920	Most people really do feel more comfortable in awkward situations with only their own sex there.
4304920	4308600	So you've got to go and have a prostate exam or you've got to go and have your cervical smear
4308600	4315240	test called a pap smear in America. You probably want somebody of the same sex as you. If you are
4315240	4321560	a Muslim woman and you want to adjust your head covering or you want to watch, you're going to
4321560	4324920	have to do that in the presence of other women. And for orthodox Jewish women, there will also
4324920	4331320	be rules about that. And you know, as you're a rape victim, or you are very shy, or you are a
4331320	4336040	domestic abuse survivor, or you were abused as a child, you may have very strong feelings about
4336040	4342520	not wanting to be vulnerable or visible in mixed sex spaces. But just most women, like even women
4342520	4345880	with none of these special characteristics, if you're going to have to undress from the waist
4345880	4351080	down, which we do in order to just have a pee, you want only other women around. Like even if
4351080	4356200	there's a door just feels better that men are outside two doors. That's why we have single sex
4356200	4362120	spaces. And if men can say I'm a woman and come into them, they're no longer single sex. So it's
4362120	4367960	a problem in all those spaces. But the two really high profile situations where it matters
4369400	4374520	are sport and prisons. Now, I think there are things that are more important than sport.
4375400	4383160	But sport is just so visible. And also, you know, when I talk about how men commit most crimes
4383160	4388280	and commit most sex crimes, men get cross, they say not all men. And they hear this is a criticism
4388280	4393000	of men. And that's why I say men are great. I'm married to one, I have two sons, I have five
4393000	4397560	brothers, they're all fantastic. Those are my friends are men. They just don't belong in women
4397560	4403080	only spaces. And the fact is that most people commit crimes, physical crimes, violent sexual
4403080	4408280	crimes, they're men. So we need to keep them out all of them. But men get pissed off when you say
4408280	4413480	that. What they don't get pissed off when you say is men are bigger and stronger and faster,
4413480	4420040	because that is also true. And so we have single sex sports in order that exceptional women can
4420040	4426280	be recognized and compete. Quite non exceptional men can defeat all women. There's a site called
4426280	4432680	boysvwomen.com if I remember correctly. And it compares the performance of under 18
4432760	4439160	American boys with world record holder women. Wow. And in pretty much every athletic
4440600	4449400	sport of any sort. So not equestrian basically is almost the only exception. American under 18 boys
4450440	4457320	defeat the world record holder Olympic winner woman. And often it's thousands of boys do it
4457320	4463400	every year. So, you know, you're, those boys are good, like obviously they're at national
4463400	4468360	standard in the US, which is very big country, very good sports. But they're not exceptional,
4468360	4473800	they're not the world's best. So if you compete, if you allow men and women to compete in the same
4473800	4479400	competitions, there won't be any professional women, there won't be any women who win. And you'll
4479400	4484840	have women ranking, you know, I mean, if you're in a club like a running club, you might be able
4484840	4490200	to imagine that the person who you might think of as actually something you might go to the Olympics
4490200	4495880	for your country. If that's a woman, when she was running as a man, she might be a decent second rank
4495880	4500840	small club runner. And running isn't even one of the things biggest difference and running it's
4500840	4507560	about 10 to 12% in weightlifting is 50% or more. And if you have weight in matched sizes, so if
4507560	4512440	you say the person is the same weight, a woman of the same physical body weight as a man will
4512440	4519160	lift 30% less at the top ranks. So that's why we have different sports. And if you allow men to
4519160	4524840	identify as women, you get just immediate absurdities. So Laurel Hubbard, who is a New Zealander, a man
4524840	4530280	who had been a relatively decent weightlifter in his youth, injured his shoulder incredibly
4530280	4535400	badly some years ago, like, you know, really just showed his elbow nearly off, you know,
4536040	4543240	he went to the Olympics in Tokyo for New Zealand, which has a joint team with the Pacific Islands.
4544040	4547560	And it's one of the sports that Pacific Islanders do very well in his weightlifting because they
4547560	4553480	were particular body type. And so the world's best women do tend to come from there. And so he
4553480	4558600	displaced a woman from the Pacific Islands, an 18 year old girl to go on to be on the team. And the
4558680	4567720	other two went from the same area. He didn't get placed, but there was a young woman from a
4567720	4573400	poor country who had survived domestic violence as it happened for a child who missed out her one
4573400	4578200	and only chance probably of going to the Olympics and presenting her country. Because a man who
4578200	4584360	was in his 40s who had suffered a career ending, nearly injury, who really wasn't very good as a
4584360	4589640	man, like he wasn't even lifting a national level in New Zealand went instead. So that just shows
4589640	4593000	you the incredible difference that there is between men and women and the things it's very
4593000	4596600	visible, like Laurel Hubbard doesn't look like a woman. Of course he doesn't look like a woman,
4596600	4602440	he's not a woman. And he's standing there as this rather out of shape man on a podium in a local
4602440	4606680	competition. And there's these girls who are two of the world's strongest women on either side
4607800	4613080	in second per place. So sport gets there because men get it, they don't feel like attacking them.
4614040	4620760	It's so visible. So absurd, so absurd. We are living in the age of the absurd, I feel like.
4622280	4626200	I sort of feel like we went into a parallel universe sometime around 2015 and I wish we
4626200	4630680	could get out of it again. Like, I used to do sensible things. I used to talk about actual
4630680	4635960	genuine policy problems. Like this isn't a real policy problem. Like if the first person, the first
4635960	4640520	man who ever said, I feel like I'm a woman and I want to compete in women's sports have been told,
4640600	4646760	no, no, no again. No, because it's so stupid, don't be ridiculous, go and compete with your
4646760	4652120	own sex. And we had never started, it would all have been fine. But now all of us are having to
4652120	4657640	work so hard to regain ground that should never have been lost. And again, these are just the
4657640	4661560	high profile examples. I'm very sorry for those girls from the Pacific Island. At least they're
4661560	4665240	not locked up with a rapist, which is happening in women's prisons right now.
4666200	4674040	That is horrific, the fact that a man who has a criminal record can just say, I feel like a woman
4674040	4681880	and, you know, heaven is moved just so he can be transferred into a woman's prison
4682680	4689800	to be put with women who he then rapes. And I understand that there is a man who identifies
4689800	4695400	as a woman, he was transferred into a women's prison, and he got two women pregnant by raping
4695400	4699960	them. And well, I mean, who knows whether it was consensual, but I mean, what does consensual
4699960	4705000	mean in prison? Like they can't get away from him, you know? Like these are very vulnerable
4705000	4710280	women. I mean, people often don't know this if they haven't ever looked at it. I mean, I often say
4710280	4715080	that the place that you see sex differences most clearly is obviously in the labor ward.
4716040	4721880	But the second place behind that where you see sex differences most clearly is in crime or in prison.
4722680	4727480	So I know the figures for the UK and I did look up the figures for the US and they're not massively
4727480	4732760	different. I mean, you imprison a whole lot more people than we do. But as a share of men and women,
4732760	4738920	what I'm saying for the UK holds roughly for the US. So about 7% of people who get admitted to
4738920	4744760	prison every year in this country are women and 93% are men. Now the women overwhelmingly commit
4744760	4750280	nonviolent crimes and get short sentences. So at any given time, about 4% of prison are women.
4750840	4756440	And the rest are men. Of the women, I think it's about 4% again have committed any sort of violent
4756440	4762920	crime. Of the men, it's it's God, it's 20% or 40%. I now can't remember which. Of the women,
4762920	4768360	it's less than 100 committed sexual crime and overwhelmingly that's non contact crimes. So
4768360	4772680	terrible things like helping to create child porn. But it's not things that make you physically
4772680	4777880	dangerous to the other people in prison with you. Of the men, it's 19% committed sexual crimes and
4777880	4783880	they were violent crimes and mostly against women. So you've got thousands and thousands of men
4783880	4788120	in men's prisons, who are there because they committed violent crimes against women,
4788120	4793400	and 100 women who committed nonviolent crimes, not against the sort of people who are locked up at
4793400	4799960	all. So you just need a few of those men to identify as women. And I mean, the incentive is high,
4799960	4804440	like if you're going to get transferred and you're a rapist. And then on top of that, you remember
4804440	4810760	that almost no rapes are even reported. Like plausibly at most one rape in 100 even gets as
4810760	4817000	far as a trial, let alone a conviction. So if you look at the men who were in prison, to have proven
4817960	4821960	that, you know, they are willing to do anti social and illegal things, a lot of them are going to be
4821960	4827160	rapists, but not actually in there for rape. Like they raped somebody and nobody knows. So even if
4827160	4831000	you say I'll keep the rapists out, if you transfer any men, there's a good chance you're transferring
4831000	4835320	a rapist, or you're going to transfer somebody who hasn't raped yet, but given the opportunity,
4835320	4839640	he will. And then the last thing that's worth saying about people who are in prison is that the
4839640	4844760	women are nearly people who have been victimized and far worse than the crime they committed
4844760	4852200	themselves. So most women who were in prison have experienced at least one domestic violence, sexual
4852200	4859160	crime, child abuse, and they've been in coercive relationships with men, like often all of those
4859160	4866280	things. And they are deeply vulnerable people, you know, they often obviously they're also criminals,
4866280	4870040	so they can be nightmares as well as very vulnerable people. But they are they're very,
4870040	4874840	very, very vulnerable people, they find a presence of men often very triggering. And then you've got
4874840	4882440	these men of whom literally at any one time, you know, cut out, I don't know, 20,000 of them
4882440	4886360	already committed a serious sexual crime against a woman and a whole load more
4886360	4891000	use their fists to solve problems. And that's who you think you can transfer into women's prisons.
4892680	4897160	Insane. Insane. And wicked. It's actually wicked. It's worse than insane.
4897720	4902040	I agree. I agree. There's something really sinister about this movement and
4902840	4909080	these policies that, you know, trans activists are pushing. And I hope I hope that people
4909960	4915560	come away from this conversation with a little bit more understanding about the ideology that's
4915560	4923240	being pushed. I hope they understand that you and I are in no way homophobic, we're in no way
4923240	4932840	against people living good lives. But we want to be connected to reality. We cannot keep distorting
4932840	4940440	reality in order to appease some fringe minority that's very aggressive and uncomfortable to deal
4940440	4947560	with. And that is difficult. People are facing this in all sorts of fields, you know, in their
4947560	4954920	workplace and all sorts of places. But I think having the facts is important. And I think remembering
4954920	4962360	that there is such a thing as objective reality. And we need to keep ourselves oriented to it.
4962360	4965320	Because if we don't, it could be very, very dangerous.
4966040	4969960	And even if people think like, you know, what's the harm in a bit of delusion? I mean,
4969960	4973320	I don't think I think there's a lot of harm in delusion, actually. But even if you are someone
4973320	4978440	who thinks that one of the trans activists slogans is be kind, they think that people like me are
4978440	4983640	very unkind. Well, listen to what I said about what they're doing to children. And listen to what I
4983640	4988600	said about what they're doing to deeply vulnerable women in prison, moving rapists and potential
4988600	4997080	rapists and unknown rapists, very violent, and ask yourself what's kind. It isn't kind to go along
4997080	5002040	with an ideology that causes so much harm, and that causes so much harm to very vulnerable people.
5002680	5006840	And that ends up with gay kids thinking that they're meant to be the opposite sex and therefore
5006840	5012520	getting sterilized. Like that's a human rights abuse at a major scale, major medical scandal.
5013080	5019480	It's not none of this is kind. So I know that I sound unkind to people who desperately want
5020360	5027480	reality to not be as it is. But when you lie to people about what's real, you end up being deeply,
5027560	5035720	deeply unkind. I agree. I agree. And I look at it in the sense of if I'm dealing with a child,
5035720	5042520	sometimes you need to be a little unkind to the child to keep them safe. And that's okay. In the
5042520	5048760	long run, that is the kind thing to do. So it's not kind to duck the difficult conversation. It's
5048760	5054040	very unkind. Like if a child says to you, you know, I want to eat ice cream for every meal,
5054360	5059800	deeply unkind to let them do it. And this is so much more serious. The harms are so much worse.
5059800	5064040	Absolutely. Absolutely. Helen, where can people find your work?
5064840	5071160	So I have a website that HelenJoyce.com. And I also tweet more than I probably should at Joyce
5071160	5076360	Gender. And anyone who wants to look at the Critic Magazine website, I have a column there. It's a
5076360	5081480	month magazine here in the UK. And but basically, if you search for me, you'll find me. And I've
5082040	5085720	done a lot of podcast interviews by this time. And you know what? I always learn from them. So
5085720	5089880	thank you for the concepts that you raised in this conversation. But if people want to listen
5089880	5094920	to more, I do have a list on my own website. But anyway, you just search for me. Wonderful. Wonderful.
5094920	5100360	I really recommend people check out your book. I think it really sheds a lot of light and clarity
5100360	5105880	on this topic. And I just want to say thank you for all the work you are doing because it takes
5105880	5110680	a lot of bravery. And I really, really respect that. Thank you very much.
