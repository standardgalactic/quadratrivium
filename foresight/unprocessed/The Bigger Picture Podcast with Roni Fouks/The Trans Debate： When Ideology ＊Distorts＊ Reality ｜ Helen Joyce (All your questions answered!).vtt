00:00.000 --> 00:08.560
Hello and welcome to the Bigger Picture podcast.

00:08.560 --> 00:15.480
Today I have with me Helen Joyce, a journalist and the author of Trans, When Ideology Meets

00:15.480 --> 00:16.480
Reality.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.800
Helen, welcome to the show.

00:18.800 --> 00:20.720
Thanks for having me on.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.640
It's a pleasure to have you here.

00:22.640 --> 00:26.960
This is a big topic and one that I've been thinking about quite a bit over the past

00:26.960 --> 00:31.840
years so it's great to get a chance to finally talk about it on the show and with someone

00:31.840 --> 00:37.640
who has done such amazing work uncovering the reality behind the trans movement and

00:37.640 --> 00:39.400
its ideology.

00:39.400 --> 00:45.480
And just as a comment, you know, I talk quite a bit about sex differences here on the podcast

00:45.480 --> 00:52.160
mostly in the context of personal development and relationships and evolution behind these

00:52.160 --> 00:58.040
differences because as far as I can tell, men and women are quite different in important

00:58.040 --> 01:00.320
and somewhat predictable ways.

01:00.320 --> 01:05.560
And I feel that the more we know about these differences, the better our lives will be

01:05.560 --> 01:07.840
and the better our relationships will be.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.600
But I haven't officially entered the trans debate so I'm looking forward to this.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.080
Oh well, good luck.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.080
Oh yes, exactly.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.080
Good luck to us.

01:15.080 --> 01:16.580
Here be dragons.

01:16.580 --> 01:17.580
I'm ready for it.

01:17.580 --> 01:18.840
I'm ready for it.

01:18.840 --> 01:24.840
So in your book, you make the distinction between biological sex and gender identity.

01:24.840 --> 01:29.840
And people listening might be thinking, what's the harm in letting people identify however

01:29.840 --> 01:30.920
they please?

01:30.920 --> 01:32.080
Live and let live.

01:32.080 --> 01:37.760
And I understand how that would appeal to our internalized liberalism but you have so

01:37.760 --> 01:44.400
beautifully shown that there are serious consequences when we try to bend reality and pretend that

01:44.400 --> 01:49.120
someone's gender identity equals their biological sex.

01:49.120 --> 01:55.240
So tell us Helen, why is a trans woman not in fact a woman?

01:55.240 --> 01:57.160
Right, big question.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.520
The whole question really isn't it?

01:59.520 --> 02:03.800
And the terminology is incredibly confusing and I think that's deliberate but it's whether

02:03.800 --> 02:05.760
or not it's deliberate, it's true.

02:05.760 --> 02:09.400
So just for your listeners, a trans woman is a man who identifies as a woman.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.840
About a quarter of people tend to think it's the other way round.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.160
They think it's a woman who identifies as a man.

02:14.160 --> 02:17.160
So when they hear trans women are women, they think to themselves of course trans women

02:17.160 --> 02:21.160
are women because your identity doesn't change what you actually are.

02:21.160 --> 02:27.120
But the claim is the reverse that a man can become a woman by saying he's a woman.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.880
So that's the first thing.

02:28.880 --> 02:33.280
And the second thing is it's right that we start from this liberal point of view.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.680
I mean, I think all well-meaning people do.

02:35.680 --> 02:42.000
We start with this position that other people have the right to feel how they like, identify

02:42.000 --> 02:46.840
how they like, do what they like as long as it doesn't hurt other people.

02:46.840 --> 02:51.360
And the thing about gender self-id, which is the short way of saying you are who you

02:51.360 --> 02:56.760
say you are when it comes to which category you fall into, man or woman, is that it does

02:56.760 --> 02:58.840
affect other people.

02:58.840 --> 03:03.160
People often have this false analogy in their mind with, for example, gay rights.

03:03.160 --> 03:06.840
And they think a gay person can tell you that they're gay and you wouldn't say no, you're

03:06.840 --> 03:11.040
not, you're straight or well-proved to me that you're gay.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.160
And there's two reasons for that.

03:12.160 --> 03:16.400
One is because there is actually an objective reality behind being gay, like in the end

03:16.400 --> 03:20.360
it does mean that you're going to fancy and end up with people who are the same sex as

03:20.360 --> 03:21.360
you.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.640
But the other reason is that apart from that person, who does it really affect?

03:24.640 --> 03:28.800
It doesn't affect me as a straight woman in terms of my own relationships, that I have

03:28.800 --> 03:30.720
one straight son and one gay son.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.440
They'll end up with whoever they end up with.

03:32.440 --> 03:37.000
And I fully expect that at some point I will welcome a daughter-in-law and a son-in-law

03:37.000 --> 03:39.520
into my life, although I only have two boys.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.320
So that's fine.

03:41.320 --> 03:48.200
But this is different because in lots of places we have single-sex spaces and a person of

03:48.200 --> 03:53.000
the wrong sex in a single-sex space, it's a bit like, I don't know what the American

03:53.000 --> 03:57.240
equivalent is, I don't know, I know you don't call petrol, I think you call petrol gasoline.

03:57.240 --> 04:03.000
But anyway, the two types of fuel for your car, we call them petrol and diesel, right?

04:03.000 --> 04:07.520
And if you put petrol in a diesel engine, even a tiny bit of it, you destroy the whole tank

04:07.520 --> 04:10.600
of petrol and you're going to have to go and get your car engine cleaned out.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.800
And same the other way round.

04:12.800 --> 04:16.440
And the person of the wrong sex in a single-sex space is like that.

04:16.440 --> 04:19.280
They break the single-sex space, just one of them.

04:19.280 --> 04:24.520
So if one man claims that he identifies as a woman and uses that claim to go into a space

04:24.520 --> 04:29.920
that's meant only for women, it's like a tiny little bit of petrol in a diesel engine.

04:29.920 --> 04:32.040
You've destroyed the whole thing.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.880
And that's not to say that men are bad and women are good or vice versa, it's the same

04:35.960 --> 04:40.040
as there are two types of fuel and they're both fine, it just depends which engine you have.

04:40.040 --> 04:44.200
So the statement that a man can become a woman by saying he's a woman, if he's just

04:44.200 --> 04:47.280
saying it at home himself in his own mind, who cares?

04:47.280 --> 04:51.880
But actually, he's saying something that wrecks things for half of the population,

04:51.880 --> 04:56.160
because he's saying something that would entitle him to come into spaces that he ruins by his

04:56.160 --> 05:00.520
presence in the same way that petrol would ruin a diesel engine.

05:00.520 --> 05:03.360
I mean, it's a sort of homely analogy, but I hope people see what I mean because I'm

05:03.360 --> 05:05.520
not saying that men are bad.

05:05.560 --> 05:10.280
People think you're saying, oh, this person's bad, they're a rapist, they're perverted.

05:10.280 --> 05:11.320
I don't say any of those things.

05:11.320 --> 05:13.160
They're perfectly nice people.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.440
They're just not in the right place.

05:15.440 --> 05:21.200
So to sum all of that up, a person's identity claim can't override the physical reality

05:21.200 --> 05:25.520
when it comes to other people's needs and perceptions and so on.

05:25.520 --> 05:30.320
And I skimmed right past there, what's the difference between sex and gender?

05:30.320 --> 05:34.000
So sex is that those two of them were mammals, we evolved.

05:34.080 --> 05:37.360
Like every other mammal in the world, we only come in two types, male and female,

05:37.360 --> 05:40.040
and it's not possible to change which one you are.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.960
The question of which one you are is an absolutely solely physical one.

05:43.960 --> 05:47.960
It's to do which type of body, with which type of body you have.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.160
Again, not one better than the other.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.640
There just are two, and that's the way it is.

05:52.640 --> 05:57.720
Gender is this like kind of multi-meaning word that different people mean different things by,

05:57.720 --> 06:02.040
like maybe it means your masculinity and femininity.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.920
Maybe it means something that you feel inside yourself,

06:04.920 --> 06:07.960
like religious people feel that they have a soul or a connection with God

06:07.960 --> 06:12.800
or that they've had a revealed truth about something like being born again

06:12.800 --> 06:14.680
or living after death or something like that.

06:14.680 --> 06:18.960
You know, there are claims that matter a lot to people, but don't matter really to other people.

06:18.960 --> 06:22.160
So to the extent that gender is a word that's even worth using,

06:22.160 --> 06:24.600
I don't because it's just got too many different meanings.

06:24.600 --> 06:29.160
It's very personal and not something that should be imposed on other people at all.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.480
It's our sex that matters when it comes to other people's perceptions and needs.

06:33.480 --> 06:41.680
I think this term, gender, understanding the history of it, can help clear this issue up.

06:41.680 --> 06:48.880
Can you tell us a little bit about where did this term come from and what made it so popular?

06:48.880 --> 06:51.960
Yeah, I mean, lots of different bits to that story, really.

06:51.960 --> 06:56.040
It wasn't a word that was often used for people's sex until relatively recently,

06:56.040 --> 07:01.320
and I really think that the main reason it got picked up was that people didn't want to say the word sex.

07:01.320 --> 07:07.200
Americans more than Europeans, because Americans tend to be more pretty about your language than we are.

07:07.200 --> 07:11.640
But also, it's actually an ambiguous word, sometimes sex,

07:11.640 --> 07:14.560
in that we also say sex for sexual intercourse.

07:14.560 --> 07:18.640
So for example, in the context of a school, it would be a very bad idea to have a questionnaire

07:18.640 --> 07:22.600
that you handed out that said, what sex are you or just sex?

07:22.640 --> 07:26.480
And then the kids write in, yes, please, or lots of it or something like that.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.720
Like you're just asking for trouble if you put sex in some questionnaires.

07:29.720 --> 07:33.080
So people tend to use the word gender when they mean sex.

07:33.080 --> 07:36.280
And that's still the most common use of the word gender.

07:36.280 --> 07:40.680
But the word gender is also used by feminists and has been for over half a century

07:40.680 --> 07:44.200
to describe the sort of impositions on the two sexes.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.720
So there are, I mean, as you said at the beginning, quite right of course,

07:46.720 --> 07:50.640
there are on average differences between men as a group and women as a group

07:50.680 --> 07:57.320
in terms of interests, some strengths and weaknesses in psychological profiles.

07:57.320 --> 08:00.400
And those things have very obvious evolutionary roots.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.800
They are, again, just, you know, on average and men and women overlap a lot.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.040
You could call that gender if you wanted.

08:06.040 --> 08:10.000
Or you could say that gender is the thing that's imposed on us by things like,

08:10.000 --> 08:14.880
oh, pink as a girl, color blue as a boy, color and men are leaders,

08:14.880 --> 08:18.640
women are handmaidens to those leaders, those sorts of things like the prison,

08:19.080 --> 08:21.440
actually, that the two sexes get put in.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.600
And that makes it so hard to be so-called gender non-conforming

08:24.600 --> 08:27.800
if you end up being a boy who cries easily and likes hugging

08:27.800 --> 08:30.400
and doesn't want to play rugby and would like to play the harp.

08:30.400 --> 08:34.440
Or you're a girl who absolutely hates wearing bows and frilly dresses

08:34.440 --> 08:37.360
and thinks rugby looks like a great sport for you, you know?

08:37.360 --> 08:42.720
So that's another meaning of gender, like the sort of imposition on the two sexes.

08:42.720 --> 08:47.680
And actually the imposition that positions men is better than women, like superior.

08:48.720 --> 08:52.680
And then one more meaning would be what you think you are yourself.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.880
And that's a meaning that was only really started,

08:55.880 --> 09:00.200
and I think about the 1980s, 90s in fringe parts of academia,

09:00.200 --> 09:03.800
the idea that what made you, like that everybody had this inner sense

09:03.800 --> 09:07.360
of whether they were a man or a woman, which might or might not be the same

09:07.360 --> 09:09.240
as actually the fact of them being a man or a woman.

09:09.240 --> 09:11.800
And you could think of that as an identity.

09:11.800 --> 09:15.640
And since then, we've only accelerated on this path towards what you might call

09:15.640 --> 09:19.040
the identitarianism, the idea that the most important thing about us

09:19.040 --> 09:24.320
is our self-chosen labels, whether you label yourself as being a person of color,

09:24.320 --> 09:26.240
like which is sort of, you know, it's a factual thing,

09:26.240 --> 09:30.720
but it's also a self-chosen label if you're a mixed race, to some extent, at least.

09:30.720 --> 09:34.080
And whether you label yourself as being of a certain religion,

09:34.080 --> 09:37.120
how you think about your national identity, you know,

09:37.120 --> 09:42.840
people tend to think about things like autism or ASD now as identitarian labels,

09:42.840 --> 09:46.280
like whether you think of yourself as a member of the ASD community,

09:46.280 --> 09:50.560
but in particular, your gender identity as another self-chosen label.

09:50.560 --> 09:54.440
And you could think of that as a part of a very long-run shift

09:54.440 --> 10:02.080
away from identity factors that are and have a lot of connection to other people,

10:02.080 --> 10:04.920
things like the membership of your church,

10:04.920 --> 10:07.960
the membership of a local community that you were born in, grew up in and would

10:07.960 --> 10:13.160
expect to die in, your family, your larger family ties,

10:13.160 --> 10:16.120
a workplace that you expected to stay in for decades,

10:16.120 --> 10:19.800
a profession that you had for your entire adult life.

10:19.800 --> 10:24.040
Those sorts of identities, as we become more fluid and mobile globally,

10:24.040 --> 10:29.880
are taking second or even third place behind very self-chosen labels,

10:29.880 --> 10:35.000
as I say, like things to do with mental illness or neurological differences,

10:35.000 --> 10:40.240
as well as sexuality, gender,

10:40.240 --> 10:46.520
maybe attachment to some slightly fringe ideas that you can find online about religion,

10:46.520 --> 10:50.360
like not just mainstream church that you actually go to every week and that you work in,

10:50.360 --> 10:56.120
but, you know, slightly cultish on occasion, ideas.

10:56.120 --> 11:00.520
Right, right. So there's a few problems here that I'm hearing.

11:00.520 --> 11:05.320
One of them is this very subjective sense of identity,

11:05.320 --> 11:11.560
the fact that we think that our identity has to do only with our internal subjective feeling.

11:11.560 --> 11:17.880
And in reality, we are very social animals, we cannot exist without others,

11:17.880 --> 11:25.080
and our identity needs to somewhat be negotiated with our tribe and with other people.

11:25.080 --> 11:31.960
So this shift into the entirely subjective, I find problematic.

11:31.960 --> 11:37.160
And the second thing that I'm hearing is there is this paradox

11:37.160 --> 11:42.680
with gender and what people call gender stereotypes and gender roles.

11:42.680 --> 11:47.240
On the one hand, we're hearing that gender is completely fluid, right?

11:47.240 --> 11:52.600
There are no two genders we can identify however we want,

11:52.600 --> 12:00.920
you know, on a whim, depending on the day. But trans people really try to emulate

12:01.640 --> 12:08.600
the gender stereotype of their choosing. They are trying to

12:10.200 --> 12:17.000
be and embody that gender stereotype. So there's this contradiction in the ideology itself.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.880
And I'll just mention, I love that you added in your book a Jungian friend that you have,

12:23.880 --> 12:30.040
a Jungian therapist, where she says that it is very problematic to turn the abstract

12:30.040 --> 12:39.160
into concrete. And yes, there are elements of our personalities that we might find masculine

12:39.160 --> 12:44.840
or we might find feminine. As you have mentioned in other interviews,

12:44.840 --> 12:49.800
you have a PhD in mathematics, which is something that might be considered

12:49.800 --> 12:56.680
typically masculine. I know that I am a pretty disagreeable person, which is also a masculine

12:56.680 --> 13:03.800
trait. But that doesn't affect my gender in the slightest. So tell us a little bit about this

13:03.800 --> 13:11.560
paradox around gender and stereotypes. Yeah, I mean, this whole topic is filled with

13:11.640 --> 13:17.560
contradictions. I mean, for example, you're told that gender is fluid, and that there is no

13:18.520 --> 13:23.080
characteristic that you can point to that tells you what somebody's gender is,

13:23.080 --> 13:26.920
except that they just told it to you. And this is related, by the way, to a sort of

13:26.920 --> 13:33.400
post truth ideology where everyone creates their own truths. Yes. And anything that is imposed on

13:33.400 --> 13:38.920
you is seen as an imposition, like a bad thing. But I mean, lots of things are just irreducibly

13:38.920 --> 13:44.840
true. I mean, I would love to be immortal. But the reality of human life is that I am going to die.

13:44.840 --> 13:48.600
I think a lot of this is actually a sort of childish, almost toddlerish

13:49.320 --> 13:54.520
tantrum against the fact that there are many things that are given and that we can't change.

13:55.160 --> 13:58.360
Well said. Yeah. So that's not good for any of us.

13:59.240 --> 14:03.000
Lisa Marchano is the name of the therapist you're thinking about. She's a Jungian psychotherapist

14:03.000 --> 14:07.560
who's extremely knowledgeable about gender and gender identity. And she said to me when I talked

14:07.560 --> 14:12.040
to her, she's she's a wonderful woman. And, you know, I really highly recommend people looking into

14:12.040 --> 14:16.920
her work, generally, but also specifically on gender. She said to me that when she found out

14:16.920 --> 14:21.720
about this first, like a lot of people, it was around 2015. And she noticed it with friends

14:22.440 --> 14:26.600
saying, you know, such and such is coming out as trans. And like a lot of us, she thought,

14:26.600 --> 14:30.440
Oh, you know, this is this is lovely. This is wonderful. These kids are playing with something.

14:30.440 --> 14:34.840
And she also, if I remember correctly, she has studied history and trained as a social worker

14:34.840 --> 14:40.360
in her past. So she has three really relevant bits of information here. So one is, you know,

14:40.360 --> 14:44.280
something about psychic contagions, because that's a Jungian concept, but also it's something

14:44.280 --> 14:49.800
that's happened through the history of medicine. Two, she's quite alert to the fact that children

14:49.800 --> 14:54.040
are very suggestible and need grown ups to set boundaries to help them to be safe and to understand

14:54.040 --> 14:59.240
the world and to navigate the path to adulthood. And three, she's a Jungian. So she thinks a lot

14:59.240 --> 15:05.320
about the power of the symbolic and how important symbols can be as the first part of the furniture

15:05.320 --> 15:10.600
of our mind. So she thought that when, and in particular, so a young also talked about the

15:10.600 --> 15:15.400
animus and the animal, which are like male and the female animating soul type concepts,

15:15.400 --> 15:18.520
it's not something I've thought about much in my own life or that I would regard as particularly

15:18.520 --> 15:24.200
helpful. But for her, it's a way of thinking about dark and light, masculine and feminine,

15:24.200 --> 15:29.160
you know, as constant balancing things that play and shift. And in any one person,

15:29.160 --> 15:32.760
you're going to have bits of both and maybe more of one than the other. But you could also,

15:32.760 --> 15:38.520
in therapy, think in a very playful way about how you as a woman might think about your masculine

15:38.520 --> 15:44.760
side or, you know, vice versa and that that might change over time. And so she thought that's what

15:44.760 --> 15:48.760
these kids were doing. She thought, Oh, how lovely they're playing. And then she found out they were

15:48.760 --> 15:54.920
getting mastectomies. And to her, that was immediately, Oh, you're concrete concretizing

15:54.920 --> 16:02.120
the symbolic. And Jung understood that in a very profound way to be extremely dangerous,

16:02.120 --> 16:07.240
that somebody would would take these playful symbolic concepts that, you know, are so useful

16:07.240 --> 16:13.160
when you're thinking about growing as a human being, and then draw them on your body in the same way

16:13.160 --> 16:20.520
that, you know, an anorexic turns self hatred or fear of adulthood, or a desire to take a

16:20.520 --> 16:24.200
blessed space in the world or something on their bodies that acted out there. That's what these

16:24.200 --> 16:28.760
kids are doing. They're acting something out on their bodies. And so she flipped in a second when

16:28.760 --> 16:33.000
she said that when she heard that, where it's for most of us, it takes a bit longer, I think,

16:33.000 --> 16:39.640
to think through it. But so then you've got this person who is expressing something very real to

16:39.640 --> 16:44.920
them, which is that in some sense, they don't feel like their own sex. Talk about what those

16:44.920 --> 16:50.360
feelings might be where their origin is how they would differ between men and women, girls and boys.

16:50.360 --> 16:55.800
But anyway, you've got a person who is saying to you, I'm not really a girl or I'm not really a boy,

16:55.800 --> 17:03.240
aren't the opposite sex or identity sex. This is a very meaningful statement. It's not a true

17:03.240 --> 17:07.960
statement in the concrete world where our mammalian bodies live. But it may be a true

17:07.960 --> 17:13.720
psychological statement that you then need to unpack. And that distinction between the two is

17:13.720 --> 17:19.000
the problem. But you've also got a person who is trying to express that to everybody else. And

17:19.000 --> 17:23.800
this this comes to your stereotypes question. Like, first of all, the stereotype may be the

17:23.800 --> 17:28.200
reason why I've got this idea in their heads, if they feel they aren't living up to a stereotype

17:28.200 --> 17:31.640
that they think is very important, like a boy thinks he's not going to be manly enough,

17:32.280 --> 17:37.480
or a girl thinks that, you know, girls are giggling creatures, you know, like wearing push-up

17:37.480 --> 17:42.200
bras and having nape extensions and ironing their waist length hair every morning. And, you know,

17:42.200 --> 17:46.600
actually, is the sort of person that you see in the really grotesque porn that's very common

17:46.600 --> 17:51.720
in schools now, like boys show girls porn, you know, as a way of bullying them, for example.

17:51.720 --> 17:56.760
Oh, God. So if you're a girl who thinks that you can't live up to the feminine stereotype,

17:56.760 --> 17:59.800
which is an impossible stereotype, incredibly thin with big tits,

18:00.520 --> 18:04.600
you know, very virginal, but at the same time puts out all of those things that we've always

18:04.600 --> 18:09.320
known about femininity, how impossible it is, then you think you must be masculine, but now

18:09.320 --> 18:14.680
you're going to have to try and show that to other people. Now, an actual boy doesn't have to act

18:14.680 --> 18:19.320
very masculine to show people that he's a boy, because everyone can see he's a boy. But a girl

18:19.320 --> 18:23.000
who wants other people to think that she's a boy is going to have to act in stereotypically

18:23.000 --> 18:26.600
masculine ways, otherwise they just won't know what she's going on about, and vice versa.

18:27.720 --> 18:32.440
So, I mean, I'm a middle-aged woman and, you know, feminine, am I masculine? At this point,

18:32.440 --> 18:36.920
I don't care. As long as I get my HRT, I'm happy, you know? But I do some feminine things,

18:36.920 --> 18:41.000
like I don't bother cutting my hair. I grow it long. I'm wearing a floral top.

18:43.480 --> 18:47.640
I'm a mother. That's a pretty feminine thing to be, I suppose, as you say, other PhD in

18:47.640 --> 18:52.520
mathematics. But anyway, I don't have to do anything, because the fact that my face was

18:52.520 --> 18:58.040
shaped by estrogen, and my body was shaped by estrogen, do it all for me. I could go out in

18:58.040 --> 19:03.080
a paper bag and people would know that I'm a one. But if I had been along the male developmental

19:03.080 --> 19:07.880
pathway, nobody would know that I thought I was a woman. So, you're going to have to wear the signs,

19:07.880 --> 19:13.880
outward signs of being a woman, to try to override the fact that you're just not, and that people

19:13.880 --> 19:20.120
can see that. And this leads people to very stereotyped self-presentation and performance.

19:20.120 --> 19:24.280
And then the final thing, which I hope we do get to talk on in more detail, is that sometimes the

19:24.280 --> 19:30.120
stereotype is the appeal. Like a lot of the middle-aged men who identify as women, they get

19:30.120 --> 19:36.600
turned on by acting feminine stereotypes. Yeah, so we will get into that. That is an interesting

19:36.600 --> 19:44.840
one. Absolutely. Absolutely. So this, I think, does help clarify why they are so married to the

19:44.840 --> 19:53.480
stereotype. And just as an aside, I do very much like Carl Jung in his thinking. And I don't buy

19:53.480 --> 19:58.200
the fact that gender stereotypes are stereotypes. I think they're archetypes. I think they're

19:58.200 --> 20:05.720
evolved just like estrogen evolved females and testosterone evolved males. And the fact that

20:05.720 --> 20:12.760
certain things we perceive automatically, it's almost like a heuristic as masculine or feminine,

20:12.760 --> 20:19.000
I think that's also evolved. And obviously, there are cultural flavors and, you know, one

20:19.000 --> 20:25.240
culture might consider dancing as very feminine. And another culture only men do that. But still,

20:25.240 --> 20:30.920
there are certain things that, for instance, thinking that nurturing is something feminine.

20:30.920 --> 20:37.240
That is not made up. And that is not a patriarchal lie. That is because women bear children and they

20:37.240 --> 20:44.520
breastfeed. And they have this built in maternal instinct. So also changing some of the language

20:44.520 --> 20:50.840
around stereotypes, we do have a lot of freedom in how we express our roles today, which I think is

20:50.840 --> 20:59.320
amazing. But understanding what femininity and masculinity is in our psyches, these built in

20:59.320 --> 21:06.280
features, I think is also important because pretending like nothing is feminine, nothing is

21:06.280 --> 21:13.160
masculine, we can be whatever we want. And then playing out the stereotypes, I think gets us into

21:13.160 --> 21:19.320
such confusion. And it's just not helpful. If I could come back on that a bit, I agree with

21:19.320 --> 21:26.360
everything you said. And that is why I don't count myself as what some, in particular, some radical

21:26.360 --> 21:31.800
feminists. So for listeners, radical in radical feminist does not mean extreme. It means going

21:31.800 --> 21:36.360
back to the root. Radical is a word that comes from root. So it's a specific school of feminism.

21:36.360 --> 21:41.640
And I don't count myself as a member of that because radical feminists are also gender abolitionists.

21:41.720 --> 21:46.680
They believe that in a world where women weren't oppressed, there would be no gender stereotypes

21:46.680 --> 21:52.280
or of any sort. I completely agree with you that many things that we call stereotypes are archetypes

21:52.280 --> 21:56.760
and that these are things that clearly evolved. Obviously, women are going to be more interested

21:56.760 --> 22:02.920
in babies than men. This just like how could that not be? Evolution does not leave. There's a famous

22:02.920 --> 22:08.120
joke about an economist as somebody who would walk past a dollar bill left on the sidewalk and not

22:08.120 --> 22:13.400
pick it up. And if you asked him why, he'd say, you know, no dollar bills get left on sidewalks,

22:13.400 --> 22:18.280
someone must already have picked it up. So evolution is like that. Evolution doesn't leave

22:18.280 --> 22:25.480
dollar bills on sidewalks. Anyway, what I would say, though, is that what is harmful and very

22:25.480 --> 22:32.840
destructive about gender and not are given is hierarchy in it. And this is a point that was

22:32.840 --> 22:37.560
made to me beautifully some years ago by Jane Clare Jones, who's a philosopher here in the UK.

22:37.560 --> 22:42.760
And she was the person who showed me that in a lot of these things, the bad isn't in difference.

22:42.760 --> 22:48.520
The bad is in turning that difference first into a binary. So it's very extreme rather than thinking

22:48.520 --> 22:53.400
that people are mixtures and they vary and it's overlapping, and then saying that one is better

22:53.400 --> 22:58.760
than the other. So if you think of masculine and feminine and you think of words to pair with that,

22:59.400 --> 23:05.880
you will hear that masculine is light and feminine is dark. Masculine is the sun, feminine is the

23:05.880 --> 23:13.480
moon. Masculine is Yin, feminine is Yang. And in every case, the masculine is the animation force,

23:14.200 --> 23:21.080
the active force, and feminine is the passive force. And those linked binaries need to be

23:21.080 --> 23:25.800
unpicked if women are to be full human beings. It doesn't mean that we can't be feminine,

23:25.800 --> 23:29.240
but to the extent that feminine means being object rather than subject,

23:30.120 --> 23:34.760
and being passive rather than active, being the servant rather than the master,

23:35.640 --> 23:39.400
and being the follower rather than the leader, you know, women want to do all of those things too.

23:39.400 --> 23:45.000
We want to live full and actualized lives too. While we're more interested in babies,

23:45.000 --> 23:48.680
while we speak more maybe, while we're better communicators, maybe while we don't have such

23:48.680 --> 23:53.960
good 3D vision, you know, why we probably don't make good firefighters in the main but are better

23:53.960 --> 24:00.760
nurses in the main than men, you know. So, because we've done this stupid thing of over exaggerating

24:00.760 --> 24:06.280
what masculine and feminine are, lying to ourselves about the fact that we have put a value judgment

24:06.280 --> 24:10.200
on how the two of them relate to each other, and then pretending that it's all stereotyped

24:10.200 --> 24:14.440
and none of it is real, we haven't even started the work of unpicking any of this that we could have done.

24:15.400 --> 24:21.080
Absolutely, absolutely. I think that is so beautifully said, because it really is that

24:21.080 --> 24:28.280
superiority and inferiority complex, right, the fact that we perceive masculinity as positive,

24:28.280 --> 24:35.160
and the fact that feminists, their solution to that was to become more like men instead of

24:35.160 --> 24:43.080
raising the value of feminine virtues and things like, you know, raising children or, you know,

24:43.080 --> 24:50.680
being nurturing of valuing that, as you said, there are value judgments here, and yes, we have

24:50.680 --> 24:59.880
evolved in a somewhat patriarchal world, but unpicking these gender archetypes doesn't mean

24:59.880 --> 25:06.360
that we need to abolish gender. So, I really, really loved how you put that. So, let's talk a

25:06.360 --> 25:14.680
little bit about gender dysphoria. What has the research shown about kids who have gender dysphoria

25:14.680 --> 25:19.960
and were left alone? So, gender dysphoria, the word dysphoria just means discomfort or misery.

25:20.520 --> 25:26.600
So, it's a discomfort or misery with either the fact of which sex you are or the stacks of the

25:26.600 --> 25:32.360
sexed body that you have. And the diagnostic tools have changed over time and the labels have changed,

25:32.360 --> 25:37.080
but basically, it's a boy who's deeply unhappy in more than just a passing sense, the fact that he's

25:37.080 --> 25:41.720
a boy, perhaps he hates his penis, perhaps he hates the role that he's supposed to play as a boy,

25:42.360 --> 25:48.760
whatever, you know, and the same for girl, like the reverse. So, this is something that,

25:48.760 --> 25:55.720
to some extent, probably, through recent history, most girls are felt because most girls find

25:55.720 --> 25:59.960
puberty really very difficult. Bleeding is starting to bleed as tough when you have your period.

25:59.960 --> 26:05.400
Breasts are the most visible outer remarker of being an adult woman, and as soon as your

26:05.400 --> 26:08.040
breasts start to develop, which is usually when you're only in your early teens,

26:08.600 --> 26:12.120
that's when you start to get catcalled and men give you unwanted attention. So, you could say

26:12.120 --> 26:17.320
that gender dysphoria is an incredibly natural thing, at mild to moderate. And, you know, lots

26:17.400 --> 26:21.800
of boys, like, if you're going to grow 18 inches in about half a second and your voice breaks and

26:21.800 --> 26:26.280
you become very, very spotty, that's also deeply depressing. So, puberty is perhaps a time that

26:26.280 --> 26:32.680
a lot of people feel some of the element of gender dysphoria. But what you didn't ever really see

26:32.680 --> 26:38.200
until very recently was significant numbers of younger kids strongly expressing that they

26:38.200 --> 26:45.160
didn't want to be their sex, or teenagers who said, much more than just, you know,

26:45.160 --> 26:48.920
it's so unfair that I have to bleed, or why do I have to stay at home while the boys get

26:48.920 --> 26:52.920
up to go out and play? Like, why do I have to help with housework? You know, to go beyond that into

26:52.920 --> 26:56.920
saying, I feel like I'm a member of the opposite sex, I was meant to be a member of the opposite

26:56.920 --> 27:01.800
sex, I really am a member of the opposite sex. That's not an idea that spontaneously occurs to

27:01.800 --> 27:08.040
many people. So, at that long preamble, it has occurred to some children in history. And there

27:08.040 --> 27:13.880
are, I think, 13 studies that I know all before the big change that happened in the last decade or

27:13.880 --> 27:18.840
so, which will come to that have looked at those kids. And they're in different countries, some

27:18.840 --> 27:24.120
of them are boys only, some of them mixed sex, some of them are rather small. All of them show

27:24.120 --> 27:30.680
that those kids outgrow their gender dysphoria if you don't concretize it. So if the family are

27:30.680 --> 27:34.840
kind to the child, try to understand what it is the kid is saying when they say, I'm not really

27:34.840 --> 27:40.360
a boy or I'm not really a girl, give them time, don't lie to them about their bodies, don't lie to

27:40.360 --> 27:45.640
other people about what sex they are, they grow out of it. And interestingly, a very large share

27:45.640 --> 27:52.600
of them turn out to be gay. So the fixed understanding by, say, 2010, among those who knew

27:52.600 --> 27:58.840
the research was that little children who expressed spontaneously the idea that they were meant to

27:58.840 --> 28:03.880
be members of the opposite sex in whatever language they used were highly likely to grow up to be gay,

28:03.880 --> 28:09.560
but would also grow out of their gender dysphoria. And this is connected with an idea we all used

28:09.560 --> 28:14.280
to know, which is that gay people are by far the most gender nonconforming people. And that gender

28:14.280 --> 28:18.920
nonconformity often comes way before puberty. So before the gay person knows they're going to be

28:18.920 --> 28:25.240
gay, before they feel any, you know, feelings of sexual attraction, they are unusual, they are

28:25.240 --> 28:29.880
different, you can spot these little fey boys sometimes, and these incredibly rough and tumble

28:29.880 --> 28:35.080
girls. Of course, some of them grow up to be straight, but just the odds chain when a kid is

28:35.080 --> 28:40.920
like that. Right, right. So that's what we knew in about 2010. And there have been some studies

28:40.920 --> 28:45.560
since that have confirmed that. But what has happened since then, two things. One is that we

28:45.560 --> 28:51.880
are creating gender dysphoria. And the other is taking that gender dysphoria to mean that you

28:51.880 --> 28:56.360
are trans and that you should do quite extreme things in terms of your self presentation and

28:56.360 --> 29:06.120
medical treatment. So by telling people that if you feel that if you don't identify with

29:06.760 --> 29:13.240
the most extreme and rigid and un-nuanced description of what it is to be a boy or a girl,

29:13.800 --> 29:17.800
then you probably aren't a boy or a girl. And that's basically what's being taught right across

29:17.800 --> 29:22.200
the Anglosphere and increasing numbers of non-English speaking European countries as well.

29:22.200 --> 29:27.960
That they're literally telling girls and boys in school from quite little that it's possible

29:27.960 --> 29:32.680
to look like a boy but really be a girl or vice versa, and that there are people who have a gender

29:32.680 --> 29:36.280
identity that doesn't match their body. How are you going to know what your gender identity is

29:36.280 --> 29:43.480
when you self-examine and you do so by reference to just incredibly regressive stereotypes? So,

29:43.480 --> 29:48.200
I mean, I'm not talking about, you know, it's unsurprising that girls like babies more than

29:48.200 --> 29:54.280
boys do. I'm talking about girls like cooking and pink and knitting and shopping and gossiping

29:54.840 --> 29:59.560
and boys like trucks and rugby and like they literally write these lists down and they tell

29:59.560 --> 30:04.440
children to look at them and self-examine. So that Zinnikid looks and thinks, oh, you know,

30:04.440 --> 30:09.240
I don't really fit in that and actually it sounds a bit shit. Maybe I'm non-binary or I like the

30:09.240 --> 30:13.080
look of the other lists better or whatever. And then they're told that makes them trans.

30:13.960 --> 30:17.560
And so now you've got a kid who's thinking about something that a child wasn't thinking about in

30:17.560 --> 30:21.880
previous eras. Like, they just weren't encouraged to think about it and encouraging people to

30:21.880 --> 30:27.800
ruminate about something creates a chain in how they think and how they feel. It's a feedback loop.

30:28.360 --> 30:31.480
And over time, you know, pretty much anyone can convince themselves that they're gender

30:31.480 --> 30:36.360
dysphoric if they give it a really good go. And then the next thing that you're told is you're

30:36.360 --> 30:42.040
given a cultural meaning for what it is to be trans that says you must declare your pronouns.

30:42.040 --> 30:46.120
Anyone who won't use your pronoun hates you and wants you dead. I mean, imagine a more

30:46.120 --> 30:50.920
wicked thing to tell a child than that anyone who slips up and looks at an obvious girl and

30:50.920 --> 30:55.160
forgets that that girl calls herself a boy, that that person is hateful and wants them dead.

30:56.280 --> 31:00.600
And then that child gets paranoid about it. They ruminate. They feel afraid. They close in.

31:00.600 --> 31:04.360
They go into their bubble of people who agree with this incredibly extreme ideology.

31:05.720 --> 31:10.360
And then they may self-medicate or they may seek medication or they go and see a gender

31:10.360 --> 31:15.320
affirmative therapist who tells them this is the right interpretation. And if they're very unlucky,

31:15.320 --> 31:20.840
they end up on drugs and that they can't be undone. You know, what you take changes your

31:20.840 --> 31:26.280
body permanently. And maybe even on the way to surgery, whereas in a culture that understood

31:26.280 --> 31:29.640
gender nonconformity, something wrong with it, gender nonconforming, some people are a lot

31:29.640 --> 31:35.800
gender nonconforming. That's fine. We can accommodate all sorts here. You know, what do you mean when

31:35.800 --> 31:39.640
you say you're really a girl? Then, you know, Jimmy, do you mean you want to go to ballet because

31:39.640 --> 31:44.200
you can go to ballet? You know, that sort of approach. Yeah, in that culture, Jimmy would just

31:44.200 --> 31:47.640
have gone to ballet. It would have been fine. And he might have grown up gay. Or he might have

31:47.640 --> 31:52.600
given up ballet. Who knows? In our culture, Jimmy is unfortunately being pushed down a much more

31:52.600 --> 31:58.760
dangerous and harmful path. And so it's hard to say what the research shows as something that

31:58.760 --> 32:03.160
it would show now because the research dates from a time that we weren't creating gender dysphoria

32:03.160 --> 32:07.640
and we weren't putting children on this pathway. Now that we are creating gender dysphoria and we

32:07.640 --> 32:12.200
are putting children on this pathway, we're probably creating a lot of children who will grow

32:12.200 --> 32:17.400
up to be adults who continue just to identify as trans and we don't know what happens next.

32:17.400 --> 32:22.040
Will they be happy for the rest of their lives with these changes? Will they live a happier life

32:22.040 --> 32:25.720
for spending their whole lives trying to tell everybody else they're not really the sex they

32:25.720 --> 32:30.040
clearly are? How will they feel about the fact that if they've undergone these physical, these

32:30.040 --> 32:36.040
hormonal and surgical changes, they'll be sterile and probably an orgasmic as well? You know, it's a

32:36.040 --> 32:41.880
huge uncontrolled, not even experiment because we're not tracking the outcomes. Right, right.

32:41.880 --> 32:46.920
I want to zoom in here because I think it's so important for people to understand

32:46.920 --> 32:53.000
what actually goes on in these gender clinics. When we talk about gender affirmation,

32:53.000 --> 32:59.960
I just want people to understand that that is the accepted policy today. If you're in a progressive

33:00.520 --> 33:08.440
state in America, I know in the UK and in Ireland, this is very much the case in many places,

33:09.080 --> 33:16.760
gender affirmation is the way to go. And I've heard this very cruel phrase that is being

33:16.760 --> 33:23.320
thrown at parents. Would you rather have a trans child or a dead child? And I cannot think of

33:23.320 --> 33:30.760
anything more cruel to say to a parent who is confused once their child to be happy

33:31.720 --> 33:39.160
sees that their child is suffering and is seeking the advice of a clinician, of someone who is

33:40.360 --> 33:47.320
certified and has worked and researched this field. And what they are being fed is a very,

33:47.320 --> 33:54.280
very dangerous ideology that distorts reality. It's a collective social delusion. And the

33:54.280 --> 34:00.280
consequences, the physical consequences are dire. And I recently had a conversation

34:01.400 --> 34:08.280
talking about these problems. What happens? What do you do when you have a child,

34:08.280 --> 34:16.760
four years old, five years old, who's gender nonconforming? I think understanding that we

34:16.760 --> 34:23.000
live in a very liberal world and if you want to go to ballet, Jimmy, go to ballet. I love that.

34:23.080 --> 34:29.240
I was in karate and kung fu classes for years because I could not stand the girls in ballet

34:29.240 --> 34:38.200
class. And no gender dysphoria here, but I liked rough and tumble play with the boys.

34:38.200 --> 34:46.200
And there was nothing wrong with that. And I think that this idea that we are telling children

34:46.360 --> 34:53.640
that they can change their sex is wrong. It is false because what they really can do

34:53.640 --> 35:00.360
is they can sterilize themselves. They can turn themselves into asexual beings. If you

35:00.360 --> 35:09.080
take puberty blockers, your reproductive system isn't going to develop and even your sexual desire

35:09.080 --> 35:14.360
isn't going to develop. A lot of these people are asexual, have experienced sexual dysfunction

35:14.360 --> 35:24.920
and these surgeries are, I can't find another word other than they create a disabled person.

35:24.920 --> 35:32.120
They have a high risk of infection, of complications. You need to take hormones for the rest of your

35:32.120 --> 35:41.480
life. You don't actually change into the other sex. You undergo this genital mutilation,

35:41.480 --> 35:48.760
this really awful process. So tell us a little bit about what happens in these gender clinics.

35:49.880 --> 35:53.480
I mean, everything you say is true. And as you were saying, as I was thinking about little Jimmy

35:53.480 --> 35:57.480
and him saying that he wants to go to ballet, and it comes back to the point I made earlier

35:57.480 --> 36:01.480
about the hierarchy between masculine and feminine, because you were doing a high status

36:01.480 --> 36:05.960
thing as a little girl doing karate. You were rejecting the low status thing, namely the girl

36:05.960 --> 36:11.000
thing, whereas a boy who wants to do ballet is very counter cultural. So that's a much harder

36:11.000 --> 36:16.040
task for parents to find space for a little Jimmy who wants to do ballet without him starting to

36:16.040 --> 36:19.720
internalize the fact he's not a real boy, that the other boys are going to mock him. They're

36:19.720 --> 36:24.120
going to say that's a girl thing to do, you're a girly, you're a sissy, you know, all of those things.

36:25.080 --> 36:30.360
And I mean, it depends where you are. You know, if you're in a liberal city, if you live in Brighton

36:30.360 --> 36:36.120
or New York, you probably, you know, there's space for that kid, but you're going to have to make

36:36.120 --> 36:40.920
that space for them as a parent. And that's a really important thing to do. And if you think

36:40.920 --> 36:47.000
we can't do it, then ask yourself what homophobia you are still harboring, because we all know

36:47.000 --> 36:51.080
that little Jimmy who wants to do ballet is more likely to grow up gay, and people who don't want

36:51.080 --> 36:56.040
them to do ballet, because they know that they wrongly think that they can change Jimmy's or

36:56.040 --> 37:01.640
suppress Jimmy's future sexual orientation by forcing Jimmy to go and do some much more manly

37:01.640 --> 37:07.480
things instead. All they can do is make Jimmy very unhappy. Okay, right. So so that's a harder task,

37:07.560 --> 37:13.160
find a holding space for those useful little fey, little special boys may grow up to be

37:13.160 --> 37:17.720
straight and fabulous. And that's fine. But let's all face it, they're more likely to be gay.

37:18.440 --> 37:23.160
Right. So what happens when you go to a gender affirming clinic, which in more and more countries

37:23.160 --> 37:27.400
is the only sort of way that a therapist is allowed to practice because of laws against

37:27.400 --> 37:34.440
they call conversion therapy, is that as soon as a child says, I understand myself to be trans in

37:34.440 --> 37:39.560
any form of words you might imagine, I feel on gender queer, I feel on gender fluid, I think I'm

37:39.560 --> 37:44.600
non binary, I know that I was really meant to be a boy, any of those words, all they hear is,

37:45.240 --> 37:52.040
you're right. It's back to this thin identity that is just so created and self stated, rather

37:52.040 --> 37:54.920
than being something that's actually about the connection that you have with other people.

37:56.200 --> 38:03.800
And then that is affirmed, you know, a good therapist affirms the situation that their

38:03.800 --> 38:07.640
client feels themselves to be in affirms their feelings by saying, I can I hear that you can

38:07.640 --> 38:11.000
feel like that you're feeling that I hear this is important to you, let's unpack it.

38:12.120 --> 38:16.680
Gender affirmation is no, you really are a boy. That's right. You know, a girl who says she's a

38:16.680 --> 38:22.200
boy really is a boy. No questioning. And then that just sort of pushes the child down a certain

38:22.200 --> 38:27.320
pathway. And anyone who disagrees with them, including the parents is positioned as somebody

38:27.320 --> 38:32.360
who hates that child wants that child dead. And I've heard too many stories to repeat now about

38:32.360 --> 38:38.680
therapists meeting a child for the first time and saying to that child in front of the parents,

38:39.400 --> 38:43.000
you know, yes, you are what you say you are and anyone who disagrees with you and you need

38:43.000 --> 38:46.840
puberty blockers or else you'll kill yourself, like telling the children, coaching them in

38:46.840 --> 38:52.920
suicide, this really is happen. And so instead of helping, they're harming. I mean, I would not

38:52.920 --> 38:57.000
under any circumstances bring a child that I've had anything to do with it anywhere near any of

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
these people, because they will only make it worse, which of course leaves you on your own.

39:01.080 --> 39:05.880
And on your own against a culture that is telling your child lies in school curricula,

39:05.880 --> 39:12.680
in reading materials, online, in government edicts. So you're really on your own. I think

39:12.680 --> 39:17.240
more than parents have ever been before about trying to deal with a societally created problem.

39:18.040 --> 39:23.000
It's worth talking a little bit about the way that this gender affirmation has become standard.

39:23.800 --> 39:30.040
I mean, really, until 10 years ago, any reputable therapist knew very well that, you know, you don't

39:30.040 --> 39:35.400
just affirm as in blindly say it's true to things that your clients say, you don't tell them it's

39:35.400 --> 39:39.560
false necessarily either. It's generally a, you know, what does this mean to you? Let's talk about

39:39.560 --> 39:45.400
it. Let's get to the root of this. And it's been by a false analogy with conversion therapy

39:45.400 --> 39:51.880
practiced on gay people a half a century ago. So the theory used to be that being gay was

39:51.880 --> 39:56.040
something that had gone wrong in your development was always blamed on the mother. I mean, mothers are

39:56.120 --> 39:59.720
the universal punching bag for everything that goes wrong with children.

39:59.720 --> 40:00.280
Since Friday, right?

40:00.280 --> 40:05.400
And the idea was, yeah, yeah. So the idea was that the mother had been too clingy or the father

40:05.400 --> 40:09.080
had been too absent and therefore the mother had been too present and that she had imposed

40:09.080 --> 40:14.200
femininity on her son. And that the boy had somehow become, had flipped somehow. He was an

40:14.200 --> 40:18.760
invert. He had gone down the wrong pathway and that you could maybe put him back on the right

40:18.760 --> 40:23.800
pathway. And the ways in which they tried to do this, by the way, completely false, but also

40:23.800 --> 40:29.000
the way they tried to do it was very cruel, which was that you would try to get a gay person,

40:29.000 --> 40:32.920
so a teenager or even a little boy. I've heard it's been done in little boys who were just very

40:32.920 --> 40:38.920
gender nonconforming. And you would try to get them to feel shame about anything that was gender

40:38.920 --> 40:46.600
nonconforming, like you would throw out the little boys and dress up clothes, you would get the adult

40:46.600 --> 40:52.520
to shame themselves about their feelings. If it was an adult, you might get them to what

40:52.600 --> 40:57.960
opposite sex porn and masturbate at the same time, you would get them to watch a bit same sex

40:57.960 --> 41:02.520
images like to be a handsome man, if it was a gay man, you're trying to convert and give them at

41:02.520 --> 41:06.760
the same time electric shocks or give him and drugs that would make him feel sick and vomit.

41:07.560 --> 41:12.760
And all you can do by doing this sort of thing is internalize a great deal of shame and also

41:13.800 --> 41:17.640
make the person associate their natural feelings of desire for an older person

41:18.600 --> 41:23.400
with revulsion. It is actually possible to suppress people, temporarily to suppress people's

41:23.400 --> 41:28.120
natural desires. What you can do is create the desire that they don't have, you know,

41:28.120 --> 41:32.520
all you can do is really make them very, very miserable. So that was conversion therapy and no

41:32.520 --> 41:38.760
therapist has done it for a decade. It was recognized to be abusive. All the psychological

41:38.760 --> 41:44.040
associations and similar worldwide put out statements apologizing for ever having suggested

41:44.040 --> 41:48.680
that this was a good idea, saying it didn't work, saying that doing anything remotely like this

41:48.680 --> 41:53.400
would get you struck off. The only place that anything even remotely similar still happens

41:53.400 --> 41:59.960
is in sort of fringe religious groups. And there you might get shamed in front of other people

41:59.960 --> 42:05.400
or prayed over or be subjected to sort of hours of haranguing. And this again is really fringe,

42:05.400 --> 42:09.960
like really, really fringe. And anything that heads into that you might be hit or anything

42:10.040 --> 42:14.680
that that would of course fall under and assault laws, like it will be illegal without ever having

42:14.680 --> 42:20.760
to say you need to have a specialist law about it. But anyway, in the last few years, activists

42:20.760 --> 42:27.320
have managed to get laws they call bans on conversion therapy past around the world. We're

42:27.320 --> 42:33.640
fighting to try to stop one here in the UK. And what they say is conversion therapy for,

42:33.640 --> 42:39.160
and this is the big bait and switch, sexual orientation and gender identity. Now,

42:39.160 --> 42:42.440
if it was just sexual orientation, it would be a law banning something that basically isn't

42:42.440 --> 42:46.920
happening. And that's annoying and bad. But anyway, you know, it's relatively minor because

42:46.920 --> 42:51.880
it's not really happening. But gender identity, as I said, it's not this fixed thing. Most people

42:51.880 --> 42:55.160
don't feel themselves to have to have a gender identity, they just know that they're male or

42:55.160 --> 43:00.200
female. And people who think of themselves as having a cross gender identity, at least in childhood,

43:00.760 --> 43:06.360
we know that tends to vanish, if you just let it alone. So there isn't a fixed thing gender

43:06.360 --> 43:10.920
identity that you would be trying to convert somebody from the way there is a sexual orientation.

43:11.720 --> 43:17.240
And what this plays out as is that anybody who tries to make any sort of effort to convince

43:17.240 --> 43:24.120
somebody that they're not whatever they say they are at risks of criminal prosecution,

43:24.120 --> 43:27.800
it depends on the law, the specific law, if they're a therapist, they might get struck off.

43:28.440 --> 43:32.520
And they might get sued by somebody if it's even a parent in some places. I mean, there have been

43:32.520 --> 43:38.360
parents who had children taken away from them in both Canada and in the US, for refusing to allow

43:38.360 --> 43:45.240
the child to go on puberty blockers, because that's seen as a conversion effort. So this law is an

43:45.240 --> 43:50.520
absolute wolf in sheep's clothing. It's an attempt to stop anybody from saying to a child, you know,

43:50.520 --> 43:56.680
hang on, what do you actually mean when you say you're not actually a girl? And to just railroad

43:56.760 --> 44:03.400
this child's straight through this entirely ideologically driven, non reality based model

44:03.400 --> 44:12.360
of whatever you say you are, you are. This is so sinister, you know, putting this into a law and

44:13.160 --> 44:20.280
taking a parent's right away from them to be a parent, to deal with their children however

44:20.280 --> 44:27.560
they see fit. And to protect them from these ideologies, it's absolutely absurd. And I think

44:27.560 --> 44:33.400
the problem is that most people just don't have the time to follow, you know, these policies,

44:33.400 --> 44:39.240
these laws. And it's really important to know the facts behind this. It sounds so nice as well,

44:39.240 --> 44:43.800
you know, it sounds so great ban conversion therapy. Yeah, I know. And then you look at

44:43.800 --> 44:48.760
it and it's not what it says it is. Exactly, exactly. Wolf in sheep's clothing, as you said,

44:48.760 --> 44:55.640
that's really well put. I want us to talk a little bit about the types of transgender

44:55.640 --> 45:03.000
isms, because we like to think of it as one big category. But really, there are types and there

45:03.000 --> 45:09.720
has been good research showing that there are types. So tell us a little bit about these categories.

45:09.720 --> 45:15.400
Sure. So the very first people who ever had any idea that somebody could be a man but really a

45:15.480 --> 45:22.600
woman were in about 1920s. And it was very linked to their understanding of homosexuality,

45:22.600 --> 45:26.360
like these early researchers and going back a little bit earlier than that about 30 years earlier

45:26.360 --> 45:31.560
than that on homosexuality, their idea of what a homosexual man was was a man with a woman's soul.

45:32.120 --> 45:35.000
That's what they really thought that you were inside, you were really a woman.

45:36.520 --> 45:42.840
But by about 1920s in Berlin, specifically, there were just a couple of doctors who felt

45:42.840 --> 45:47.960
that it was possible not just to be a man with a woman's soul who wanted to sleep with men,

45:47.960 --> 45:51.960
but that you might be a man with a woman's soul in a way that made you want to present as a woman.

45:51.960 --> 45:57.640
So they saw it as a type of cross dressing. And if you look at the early work, their early writing

45:57.640 --> 46:01.160
about it, they understood that it was different whether the man wanted to sleep with men or

46:01.160 --> 46:04.360
wanted to sleep with women. So they understood right from the beginning that there were two

46:04.360 --> 46:09.480
types of men who might think of themselves as women or want to sleep, like take the woman's

46:09.480 --> 46:13.400
role in sex, you might call it. And that was the gay ones and the straight ones.

46:14.120 --> 46:20.120
So those are the two types still that we think of. If you're any sort of serious sexologist who

46:20.120 --> 46:26.040
isn't entirely had your brain eaten by identity and identity politics and queer theory, you still

46:26.040 --> 46:30.920
understand that there are these two types of men who feel that they're women. And there's

46:30.920 --> 46:36.840
entirely different paths to it. So for the gay men, it'll be somebody who is a really gender

46:36.840 --> 46:42.360
nonconforming little boy. And it was established really 20 years ago by in a research paper that

46:42.360 --> 46:46.520
looked at all the previous research about how gender dysphoria developed in children.

46:47.640 --> 46:52.120
And what it concluded was you started with the gender nonconformity. Child didn't typically feel

46:52.120 --> 46:58.760
gender dysphoric. Shame followed because of the way that the gender nonconformity was

46:58.760 --> 47:02.920
responded to by the people around you. So a dad who tried to toughen you up,

47:03.800 --> 47:08.120
and, you know, classmates bullying you and leaving you angst and calling you a sissy,

47:08.120 --> 47:15.080
and so on, that creates enormous shame in a boy who is different. And that shame becomes

47:15.080 --> 47:20.600
self-patriot. And then at some point the question occurs to the little boy, was I really meant to

47:20.600 --> 47:25.080
be a girl? And that's the origin of that sort of gender dysphoria. And somebody who goes along

47:25.080 --> 47:31.960
that classic pathway, ideally what'll happen when they hit puberty is sexual desire rears its head

47:31.960 --> 47:35.560
and they finally understand themselves to be gay. And then, you know, this is not an easy path to

47:35.560 --> 47:39.800
adulthood when you're shamed with who you are and you maybe live in a homophobic society.

47:40.440 --> 47:45.560
But anyway, a load of gay men of my generation and above have had to navigate that path and they

47:45.560 --> 47:50.280
understand themselves to be gay and they have done a lot of work on themselves to get rid of the

47:50.280 --> 47:55.560
shame. But some haven't and some can't. And in the end they feel that they just be happier and more

47:55.560 --> 48:01.880
natural. They present as women. And so these people typically tend to be very feminine in their

48:02.120 --> 48:08.120
presentation and style and always have been, pass quite well often, and are quite realistic

48:08.120 --> 48:14.760
actually. They know they're not women and they don't tend to want to impose on women. I don't think

48:14.760 --> 48:19.480
any man belongs in women's spaces but these men because they're gay are not actually a massive

48:19.480 --> 48:24.600
threat to women. And that's what most people think that all trans men are, like all trans-identified

48:24.600 --> 48:28.280
men, all trans women, they think that they think that it's a gay man who's had a lot of surgery

48:28.360 --> 48:33.400
and is really unusually, you know, feminine. But they're probably the minority who've been

48:33.400 --> 48:39.160
seen in gender clinics over the last number of decades. The majority come in older. They're

48:39.160 --> 48:45.160
heterosexual. They've often been married and have kids and they're often very notably not very feminine

48:45.160 --> 48:49.480
in their self-presentation. They're quite hard charging men. Typically they've done things like

48:49.480 --> 48:54.120
engineering, computer science. There's a lot of them in the military. And these men have something

48:54.200 --> 49:00.440
more complicated which is that they get aroused at the idea of being a woman. So they like women,

49:00.440 --> 49:05.400
not men, but the woman they like best is the imaginary woman that they are. And those men

49:05.400 --> 49:09.400
have typically been cross-dressings as they were teens. It often starts by stealing your sisters

49:09.400 --> 49:14.600
or your mother's underwear and masturbating in it. And those men often conceal the fact that that's

49:14.600 --> 49:20.440
how they get their thrills. They get married, they have kids maybe, and then at some point their

49:20.440 --> 49:26.680
wife finds out that their husband is wearing their dresses. And this is a big part of his life.

49:26.680 --> 49:31.480
And often what happens is this man makes it to his forties or fifties. And by this point,

49:31.480 --> 49:35.960
you know, he's conquered everything else. He's maybe cruising towards retirement and it's time

49:35.960 --> 49:41.720
for the woman inside to come out and play. Right, like Caitlyn Jenner is a great example of this.

49:42.360 --> 49:45.000
Yeah, I mean, I don't want to diagnose somebody that I don't know. But I mean,

49:45.960 --> 49:49.640
it does look pretty typical. So if you imagine Caitlyn Jenner, you're probably imagining

49:49.640 --> 49:53.720
the right thing. But I don't know Caitlyn Jenner and I'm not a psychological professional.

49:54.280 --> 50:04.040
So that person is often somebody who, like, their dearest wish is to really be a woman.

50:04.040 --> 50:09.480
And the thing that's different about this from homosexual orientation is that it requires

50:09.480 --> 50:14.120
other people to play along. So the gay man says to me, I'm gay. And I say, no, you're not.

50:14.680 --> 50:17.800
Like he goes, oh, yes, I am. But I don't care what you think.

50:18.680 --> 50:23.320
If a man who says he's a woman says to me, he's a woman. And I say, no, you're not.

50:24.040 --> 50:28.440
I'm destroying his deepest fantasy. Right. And if I say to him, no, you can't come into this

50:28.440 --> 50:32.600
space because this space is women only. I'm stopping him from living out something that he's

50:32.600 --> 50:37.400
been fantasizing about possibly for decades. And remember, he's a man, he's got male entitlement.

50:38.280 --> 50:41.640
He's somebody who thinks that he gets what he wants. And this is the latest thing that he wants.

50:41.640 --> 50:47.000
And so these men are hyper aggressive. So if you want to think about the nastiest and most

50:47.000 --> 50:53.960
entitled, aggressive woman hating, and just horrible trans activists, and of course,

50:53.960 --> 50:56.840
there are plenty of trans people who are not like this. But if you want to think about the

50:56.840 --> 51:02.440
ones who cause the most problem, it's these men. And that is because the one word they will not

51:02.440 --> 51:08.760
hear from women is. And I'll say one more thing about these men. It's that part of the fantasy

51:08.760 --> 51:13.560
for them is that they would have been much happier if they hadn't gone through male puberty,

51:13.560 --> 51:16.920
because they don't pass. They've, you know, they're in their 40s, they're trying to transition now,

51:16.920 --> 51:20.360
they've got deep voices, they've got big jaws, they've big hands and feet, they're tall.

51:21.240 --> 51:26.200
They've got the whole body of a man. It's too late to send them down the other pathway.

51:27.240 --> 51:31.400
And it's a source of grace grief to them that they can't pass. And it's a big part of what they

51:31.400 --> 51:38.360
fantasize about. So they project that fantasy, boys, and they think that they often sort of,

51:38.360 --> 51:42.200
you know, retrofit their history. They'll say things to you like, I knew I was a girl right

51:42.200 --> 51:46.120
from when I was little. And you're like, well, I mean, there wasn't any evidence at the time.

51:47.000 --> 51:51.160
You didn't act very feminine. And you did get girl to get married and have two kids or whatever.

51:53.080 --> 51:58.040
So but the fact that they project that on little boys and they are biggest cheerleaders for very

51:58.040 --> 52:03.320
early medicalization of gender dysphoria kids. And they are not interested in the fact that most

52:03.320 --> 52:07.320
of those kids will grow out of it. They want those kids put on puberty blockers before puberty

52:07.320 --> 52:11.560
starts. They want those they want to lower the ages, kids can get cross sex hormones.

52:11.560 --> 52:17.160
They want surgery done even before 18, because it's part of their own sexual fantasy. And they

52:17.160 --> 52:21.400
don't care about the fact that actually the biggest group seen in gender clinics now are girls,

52:21.400 --> 52:25.160
who aren't even part of this damn profile. And we didn't even start talking about the girls,

52:25.160 --> 52:31.960
like we just talked about the boys. The girls, the girls is a whole other issue. And just to

52:31.960 --> 52:37.800
give people a little context, this is new. Transgenderism has usually been seen in men

52:38.360 --> 52:47.400
with androphilic men who are homosexual and do want to be women, but with men and the auto

52:47.400 --> 52:54.840
gynephilia, men who are attracted almost to themselves really as women and have this fantasy,

52:54.840 --> 53:02.440
as you said, of being women. But teenage girls being gender dysphoric is completely new. And

53:02.440 --> 53:09.480
we we hinted at it at the beginning with this social contagion. So give us a little context.

53:09.480 --> 53:15.080
What is happening to teenage girls today? So Abigail Shrier wrote a book that was very

53:15.080 --> 53:19.320
specifically about these girls called Irreversible Damage. And in it, she said that she had tried

53:19.320 --> 53:24.440
to find papers, the earliest papers, academic papers that covered gender dysphoria and teenage

53:24.440 --> 53:29.320
girls, and she couldn't find a single one before 2010. It literally wasn't a phenomenon. There

53:29.320 --> 53:33.560
were there was none. Almost no children were seen in gender clinics. And when they were,

53:33.560 --> 53:39.640
it was really invariably boys or nearly invariably boys. You did see some women in gender clinics

53:39.640 --> 53:45.880
early, but they were variably like really hyper butch lesbians who just found that they just

53:45.880 --> 53:49.400
wanted to be taken from men, they wanted rid of their breasts, they wanted to marry a woman,

53:49.400 --> 53:53.720
they wanted to live in first commas live like men, like they just they just didn't want anyone to

53:53.720 --> 53:58.520
think of them as women. And often they could pass because if you testosterone is like a one-way

53:58.520 --> 54:02.200
gait, it's like, you know, it's like they say easily in but not easily out. So the mobster in the

54:02.200 --> 54:06.840
lobster pot, you know, testosterone testosterone is that. So someone who's gone through male

54:06.840 --> 54:11.480
puberty is never going to pass as a woman without extensive surgery, including on their face,

54:12.360 --> 54:17.240
and probably not even then. But a woman, even a woman who's gone through female puberty, if she

54:17.240 --> 54:22.360
takes testosterone, she'll grow facial hair, she'll bulk up on her muscles. She may have

54:22.440 --> 54:27.720
looser hair if she carries the gene from male patterned baldness. She's got a much better chance

54:27.720 --> 54:31.720
of passing as a man. So that was what they used to see in gender clinics, the occasional lesbian

54:31.720 --> 54:37.240
woman who came in and wanted testosterone and to have her breasts removed. Never saw teenage girls

54:37.240 --> 54:43.000
and never saw gender conforming women either. So what happened? I mean, you could say the internet

54:43.000 --> 54:50.040
happened, Tumblr happened. Teenage girls have always been the group most susceptible to social

54:50.040 --> 54:57.320
contagion. Right, I mean, I generally am on the fence about to what extent that's something real

54:57.320 --> 55:04.040
about teenage girls psychology or to what extent it is. The fact that female puberty is really hard

55:04.040 --> 55:10.440
to navigate when our ideas of what a girl is are so unattainable. But it's girls who got anorexia,

55:10.440 --> 55:16.920
anorexia much more than boys, it's girls who self harm, who cut, who do bulimia, like vomit.

55:17.000 --> 55:21.960
It's girls now who are on TikTok, identifying as having multiple personalities. These things

55:21.960 --> 55:26.440
just really spread through groups of girls in a way that they don't groups of boys or mixed sex

55:26.440 --> 55:32.920
groups. And the sad fact is that since 2010, the cultural contagion among girls has been

55:32.920 --> 55:39.480
trans identification. And what really facilitated this and made it the cultural contagion of

55:40.120 --> 55:46.600
time is the internet and specifically internet sites where children congregate without adults.

55:46.920 --> 55:52.120
This is unprecedented in human history, that there has been a very serious and large social

55:52.120 --> 55:57.880
space where only children are and where there are no adults. We have let our children raise

55:57.880 --> 56:04.920
themselves and each other in places like Tumblr and now TikTok. And children are more volatile,

56:04.920 --> 56:09.880
less experienced, worse at weighing risks, obviously much more naive because they have much

56:09.880 --> 56:16.440
less life experience. And if you leave them in places where there's nobody older and more

56:16.440 --> 56:22.520
experienced and willing to say no, they really spiral off into oddities. And so you started

56:22.520 --> 56:27.640
to see around by 2013 to 2015 on Tumblr, these questionnaires about, you know, identify your

56:27.640 --> 56:32.280
gender and it would be like, it was like, it was like, bloody Tamagotchi or Pokemon, you know,

56:32.280 --> 56:39.880
like, got to catch them all lists, random, you know, unicorn gender, and very febrile.

56:40.840 --> 56:45.880
And there were no adults. So I think it was Lisa Littman, who is the woman who

56:47.000 --> 56:52.120
coined the phrase rapid onset gender dysphoria for these girls. She found out about it the

56:52.120 --> 56:57.240
way that many people did by friends telling her about trans issues or seeing things on Facebook.

56:57.240 --> 57:00.840
And at first she thought like everybody else, you know, how lovely they must have been accepted.

57:01.720 --> 57:07.240
And then she had a training, a background in epidemiology. So she was used to thinking about

57:07.240 --> 57:12.520
rates of things. And after she saw about the third or fourth child, all teenage girls come out in her

57:12.520 --> 57:17.160
relatively small community, she thought this is realistic, like I'm told that the rate of

57:17.160 --> 57:23.960
trans identification in girls is 120,000. So I'm not going to see four of them in rapid succession

57:23.960 --> 57:28.440
in one community. So she started to look into it and she went and she looked on Tumblr and she

57:28.440 --> 57:33.800
sent what she saw horrified her. It was children giving the worst possible advice to each other,

57:33.800 --> 57:38.360
girls saying things like, if you think you might be trans, you really are.

57:39.160 --> 57:43.800
And if you tell your parents and they say anything that's not affirmative, they hate you,

57:43.800 --> 57:48.440
they want you dead, you should cut yourself off immediately. You'll find better advice here than

57:48.440 --> 57:54.280
you find if you go to the doctor, doctors are ignorant, you know, really awfully damaging things.

57:55.160 --> 57:59.960
And we've never ever created a space like that before. It's as if we've got the worst possible

57:59.960 --> 58:03.720
thing that these teenage girls could do and tell each other and we put them in a gated community

58:03.720 --> 58:08.360
where no adults come in and we've let them go for many years on this sort of thing.

58:09.000 --> 58:15.400
Like Tumblr cracked down on sites glorifying and posts glorifying anorexia and self-harming.

58:15.960 --> 58:21.480
They were really bad and suicide as well. But it never cracked down on the gender stuff and

58:22.600 --> 58:27.080
spawned an entire generation's contagion and now it's all moved to Tik Tok where honestly

58:27.720 --> 58:31.880
the amount of gender-related bullshit and if you try to say anything sense, you lose your account.

58:32.680 --> 58:39.160
Wow. Wow. No, that is incredible. I want to give people a little glimpse into the psychology here

58:39.160 --> 58:45.720
of the teenage girl because I find it really fascinating. First of all, in puberty, puberty

58:45.720 --> 58:52.360
is it easy for anybody, but girls definitely have a harder time, society's expectations, period.

58:53.000 --> 59:00.440
All of these things are difficult, but women also have a rise in eroticism during those years.

59:00.440 --> 59:08.520
So that heightened negative emotion also sets the stage. And I heard an interview with a girl

59:08.520 --> 59:14.600
who transitioned and then detransitioned. I forgot her name. I think it's something Cole.

59:15.240 --> 59:21.320
She was on- Chloe Cole, that big Chloe Cole. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Wonderful, wonderful interview

59:21.320 --> 59:26.840
with Jordan Peterson. I really recommend it. And what you find out there is that she

59:27.560 --> 59:37.160
had fantasies of becoming a woman, a vivacious, voluptuous, Kim Kardashian type woman. And she

59:37.160 --> 59:42.840
found later on that she she's a bit autistic. She's on the spectrum. So that also clues us

59:42.840 --> 59:48.120
into the fact that she wasn't good at reading social cues and she didn't get along with girls

59:48.120 --> 59:54.280
because of that. She had a harder time with with girls and feminine typical things.

59:55.320 --> 01:00:03.160
And people who are autistic do tend to like things more than people. So you have this gender

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:10.200
non-conforming kind of till and you have these fantasies of becoming a woman and you have this

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:15.880
awkward stage of puberty. And God, I remember it. You know, everything grows at the wrong

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:22.520
pace and the wrong rate and you see all of these Victoria's Secret models and, you know,

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:31.240
I'm never going to be like that. And her solution then, reading Tumblr, was maybe I need to be a boy.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:40.440
And I won't go into too much detail about the horrific things she underwent and the consequences

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:48.280
and the symptoms. But it really is devastating. And when you realize that at the heart of it was

01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:56.120
truly a fantasy of being a woman. And her only solution was this trans ideology that she was

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:06.200
fed. So definitely needs more thought and more care and get your teenage girls away from social

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.760
media. And something that I should say, and I haven't heard other people say this, so maybe it's

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:15.320
a good time to discuss it. I think anyone who is immersed in this topic knows how dangerous

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:20.520
Tumblr was and that TikTok is an absolute cesspit at the moment. What you may not know is that fan

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:26.040
fiction websites are a big inculcator of this stuff. Interesting. So yeah, so there's two

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:31.560
big fanfic websites that I know about and I'm just really interested in them. There are a window into

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:35.800
the mind of teenage girls and young women. Others thought we don't have anywhere else,

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:41.000
because the way they work is they're unmediated. As long as you don't make copyright claims,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.160
pretty much anything goes. And there's literally millions of stories on the two big ones,

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.480
Archive of Our Own and fanfiction.net. There are other ones as well. But literally millions,

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:55.400
I think there's more than 10 million on Archive of Our Own. And they tend to start from a story

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:59.800
that pre-exists, although there are some that are original. Harry Potter is very, very popular,

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:04.120
because Harry Potter was established at the right stage. The kids who grew up with Harry Potter

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:09.160
arrived at the right age to want to write fanfic. And you start by saying to yourself,

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:13.960
like, what happened next? What happened after Voldemort was defeated? And there's, I think,

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:18.200
more than a million stories that follow on from Harry Potter just alone, but there's thousands

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:25.000
of fandoms. Anyway, so these are not edited and they are not gate kept in the way that, say,

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:30.360
erotic fiction or romance fiction or adventure fiction or anything young adult is. Like,

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:34.920
somebody has to publish that stuff. This stuff is just by girls, for girls, or young women.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:40.920
And some of it's extremely good. But you can study it because you can sort things and you can

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.920
search by tags. And I've done a fair bit of that. I wrote an article about it just more than five

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:49.320
years ago and I went back to it to see what had changed. Very much more porny was one of the

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:58.440
big ones. Porn related tags like slapping, choking, spitting, anal, gang bang, those things had

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:03.480
really become much more common. So there's a horrible feedback loop between the porn, the

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:10.280
boys watch and the erotic stuff that girls write. But there's a lot of what's called slash fiction

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:18.120
there. So the slash is the punctuation sign. And it goes back decades to the fan fiction that was

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:24.840
written before the internet and published in fanzines about Star Trek. And it started with

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:32.520
being women writing about Captain Kirk and Spock getting together. And so it was Kirk slash Spock,

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:39.400
K slash S, just slash. So slash fiction is any fan fiction that is written about two

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:46.040
characters who in the original are heterosexual men getting it together. And this I think is the

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:51.640
female equivalent of men watching so-called lesbian porn. And so lesbian porn isn't about

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:55.640
lesbians. It's about the sort of woman who appeals to men, but there's two of them. And men will

01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:59.320
commonly say, well, you know, you get rid of it, I don't like watching, which is the man, I don't

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.400
like seeing men, they're getting in the way, they're ruining my view. Two women are better than one,

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:08.280
you know, those sorts of things. So why do women like slash? I don't, by the way, myself. I find

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:13.480
it incredibly irritating, but lots and lots of women do. And they write stories. So when I was

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:19.880
writing about this, I think in 2017 or 18, the most popular pairing in the Harry fiction in Harry

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:27.240
Potter category on Archive of Our Own was Draco and Harry getting together. I know it's now,

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:31.560
I think that's second now. And the most common is Hermione and Harry. So that's overtakenness.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:37.560
But anyway, so girls write a lot of fiction that gets two boys together. But then you look at what

01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:43.320
they write. And yes, they are using porn tropes. And, you know, they learn from each other. And so

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:49.320
you know, things that are seen in gay porn do creep in. But you as you read it, if you do look at

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:54.920
it, they don't read like men. These men don't read like men and they don't read like gay men either.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:05:01.240
And if you ask a gay man to read it, he thinks it's hysterical. These men are kind of womanly.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:05.400
And the best way I can describe them is that they're like a Korean boy band.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.840
So they're kind of huge and they and they hold hands and they talk about their feelings and

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:16.440
they may have sex that's written in a lot of detail. But they're kind of girls. And I genuinely

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:22.360
think that these bloody sites are selling girls an idea of what it is to be a gay boy that they

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:27.080
really like to look all. Because it used to be that it was only the very gender nonconforming

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:30.200
girls who were going, you know, going to grow up lesbian. They were the ones who transitioned.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:33.320
And I mean, that's bad enough. But you kind of see where they're coming from. Like it's the

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:38.680
wrong solution, but you see what they're saying. But now it's these very feminine girls. And like

01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:43.400
how what is a feminine girl thinks she's good. And she's so she wants to be a gay boy. And I

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:48.040
mean, I said, I have a gay son. Like, this is not this is a non-starter gay men aren't interested

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:52.280
in women. They really aren't even in women who have taken testosterone. But they're imagining

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:59.240
themselves to be this sort of Korean boy band aesthetic. And so they're, I don't know, it's

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:04.760
very strange. It's like a self coaching into a weird, cultish belief. And lots of girls are

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:11.640
doing this. It's really a collective delusion, what it sounds like. It's inverting reality completely

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:19.640
and allowing these girls to entertain, you know, the reality of, oh, I can I can be a boy and have

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:24.920
that romance that I really want. Yeah, just be this, yeah, and be this like holding hands type

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:28.760
of boy. And I'm not saying that gay boys don't hold hands, but you do know what I mean. If you

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:33.800
picture those Korean boy band boys, there's an expression in French that gets used in English

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:40.680
in crimes, which is fully other, which is like a madness of two. And it's crimes that are committed

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:46.040
by partners that you think would probably not be committed by only one of them. They egg each other

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:51.320
on and they end up committing even a murder together. So I think whatever the collective

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:57.240
equivalent of fully other is, this is a madness that gets created by large numbers. And again,

01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:02.840
it's this unmediated space where there aren't adults, there isn't reality, there's no gay keeping.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:06.440
And in some ways that's brilliant, it's super creative, like there's incredibly brilliant

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:10.280
ideas on these sites. You know, you could lose yourself there for years if you wanted,

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.640
but one of the things that happens there is that significant numbers of girls

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:19.080
develop gender dysphoria, create an idea of what it would be to be a gay boy or this

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:24.440
they sweet kind of girly variety, and then catastrophically take steps that can't be

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.960
undone. It doesn't end up just being a phase, like being a goth would have been a phase,

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.760
you know, like this was just got 2.0, I wouldn't care.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:37.960
Right, right. I think they almost think that they can solve the problems that they're facing

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:45.000
as girls as developing women and get to enjoy, you know, all the good parts in this illusion.

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:51.160
Incredible, incredible. I've never heard of that. And, you know, I do, I know about kind

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:56.600
of fan fiction and fantasy from Euphoria, the TV show, there's one character who's like really

01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:04.680
heavily into that kind of erotica, but I have not heard about this like weird boy on boy,

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:09.880
but imagined in a girl's mind kind of romance stories. Incredible.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:15.880
Oh, my jaw dropped when I heard about it first. Like, I actually, I was, why did I hear about this?

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.400
I can't actually remember where I heard about it first. I had to go off and look it up.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:24.520
And I actually sat there, I could feel my mouth go, what? But you know,

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:28.280
and when I wrote this article, like I looked into it, you know, there's been some scholarly work

01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:35.080
done on early slash fiction. And I talked to a woman who had written a short book on Kirk slash

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:40.120
Spock. And she was really interesting talking to her about it. And when she decided she wanted

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:46.360
to research it, she reached out to a famous evolutionary psychologist who was retired.

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:50.760
And she quoted from his letter and replied to her in the foreword to her book.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:56.680
And he said the same thing. He said he got her letter. She wrote what this was. She said that

01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:00.280
I want to do some research on this, you know, would you consider supervising, I think was a

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:05.000
master's degree on it or something. And he said he sat there, he said my jaw dropped,

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.480
and I had to rewrite reread what she had written several times to make sure that I hadn't misunderstood

01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:13.960
it. So if you're not one of the people who finds like, I promise you some of your listeners right

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:20.760
now are thinking, Oh, that sounds nice. And they haven't heard about it before, but they're going

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:27.080
to go and look. So they're all whatever floats your boat, whatever floats your boat. But these girls

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:34.680
madness of large numbers. And crazy, crazy, crazy. I again, keep your teenage daughters away from

01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:41.640
social media the best you can have them rooted in reality, in real friendships and relationships.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:48.280
I think that's a good course. I do want us to touch upon this issue that you have spoken about

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:56.600
as well, which is trans rights impinging on women's rights. And we see that in these extreme cases

01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:02.280
of women's sports and women's prisons. So tell us about what is going on.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:08.840
So I always try and unpack that statement, because I ask what, you know, what are trans rights?

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:14.520
If by trans rights, we meet the human rights that everybody has, you know, to freedom of

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:22.520
belief, freedom of expression, safety, dignity, to be able to work without prejudice and so on,

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:26.680
absolutely trans identified people have exactly the same rights as everybody else. And so they

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:31.400
should, you should not be able to fire somebody or refuse to rent them or kick them out of a bar

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:37.880
or any of those things like that. What the trans rights are human rights. And it's meant to me.

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:45.800
Is that unless you go along with a trans identified person's identity, their actual sex,

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:49.320
you are denying their human rights. And they will often say you're denying my right to exist.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:53.720
Right. So a man who identifies as a woman is like what I said at the beginning of this show,

01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:58.440
you know, he's petrol. She's diesel. They're both lovely. They're great. When you put them in the

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:02.680
right tanks, fantastic. When you put them in the wrong tank, they cause a big problem.

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:07.800
So if a man who identifies as a woman takes that as being that he can come into women in

01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:11.560
these spaces, he destroys women only spaces, like just that's just a logical statement.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:15.880
He's a man. So he comes into all in space. It's no longer a woman only space. And that

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:19.720
doesn't change if he calls himself a woman, because we can't actually turn men into women.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:26.120
Like he thinks of himself as a woman, but he's not. So it's a problem for all women only spaces

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:30.840
actually like even the ordinary ones. You have to ask yourself why we have women only spaces in

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:37.080
the first place. And it's always basically comfort, safety, privacy, privacy and dignity.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:44.920
Most people really do feel more comfortable in awkward situations with only their own sex there.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:48.600
So you've got to go and have a prostate exam or you've got to go and have your cervical smear

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:55.240
test called a pap smear in America. You probably want somebody of the same sex as you. If you are

01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:01.560
a Muslim woman and you want to adjust your head covering or you want to watch, you're going to

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.920
have to do that in the presence of other women. And for orthodox Jewish women, there will also

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:11.320
be rules about that. And you know, as you're a rape victim, or you are very shy, or you are a

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:16.040
domestic abuse survivor, or you were abused as a child, you may have very strong feelings about

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:22.520
not wanting to be vulnerable or visible in mixed sex spaces. But just most women, like even women

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.880
with none of these special characteristics, if you're going to have to undress from the waist

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:31.080
down, which we do in order to just have a pee, you want only other women around. Like even if

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:36.200
there's a door just feels better that men are outside two doors. That's why we have single sex

01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:42.120
spaces. And if men can say I'm a woman and come into them, they're no longer single sex. So it's

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:47.960
a problem in all those spaces. But the two really high profile situations where it matters

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:54.520
are sport and prisons. Now, I think there are things that are more important than sport.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:03.160
But sport is just so visible. And also, you know, when I talk about how men commit most crimes

01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:08.280
and commit most sex crimes, men get cross, they say not all men. And they hear this is a criticism

01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:13.000
of men. And that's why I say men are great. I'm married to one, I have two sons, I have five

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.560
brothers, they're all fantastic. Those are my friends are men. They just don't belong in women

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:23.080
only spaces. And the fact is that most people commit crimes, physical crimes, violent sexual

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:28.280
crimes, they're men. So we need to keep them out all of them. But men get pissed off when you say

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:33.480
that. What they don't get pissed off when you say is men are bigger and stronger and faster,

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:40.040
because that is also true. And so we have single sex sports in order that exceptional women can

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:46.280
be recognized and compete. Quite non exceptional men can defeat all women. There's a site called

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:52.680
boysvwomen.com if I remember correctly. And it compares the performance of under 18

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:59.160
American boys with world record holder women. Wow. And in pretty much every athletic

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:09.400
sport of any sort. So not equestrian basically is almost the only exception. American under 18 boys

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:17.320
defeat the world record holder Olympic winner woman. And often it's thousands of boys do it

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:23.400
every year. So, you know, you're, those boys are good, like obviously they're at national

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:28.360
standard in the US, which is very big country, very good sports. But they're not exceptional,

01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:33.800
they're not the world's best. So if you compete, if you allow men and women to compete in the same

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:39.400
competitions, there won't be any professional women, there won't be any women who win. And you'll

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:44.840
have women ranking, you know, I mean, if you're in a club like a running club, you might be able

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:50.200
to imagine that the person who you might think of as actually something you might go to the Olympics

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:55.880
for your country. If that's a woman, when she was running as a man, she might be a decent second rank

01:14:55.880 --> 01:15:00.840
small club runner. And running isn't even one of the things biggest difference and running it's

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:07.560
about 10 to 12% in weightlifting is 50% or more. And if you have weight in matched sizes, so if

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:12.440
you say the person is the same weight, a woman of the same physical body weight as a man will

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:19.160
lift 30% less at the top ranks. So that's why we have different sports. And if you allow men to

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:24.840
identify as women, you get just immediate absurdities. So Laurel Hubbard, who is a New Zealander, a man

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:30.280
who had been a relatively decent weightlifter in his youth, injured his shoulder incredibly

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:35.400
badly some years ago, like, you know, really just showed his elbow nearly off, you know,

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:43.240
he went to the Olympics in Tokyo for New Zealand, which has a joint team with the Pacific Islands.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.560
And it's one of the sports that Pacific Islanders do very well in his weightlifting because they

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:53.480
were particular body type. And so the world's best women do tend to come from there. And so he

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:58.600
displaced a woman from the Pacific Islands, an 18 year old girl to go on to be on the team. And the

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:07.720
other two went from the same area. He didn't get placed, but there was a young woman from a

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:13.400
poor country who had survived domestic violence as it happened for a child who missed out her one

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:18.200
and only chance probably of going to the Olympics and presenting her country. Because a man who

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:24.360
was in his 40s who had suffered a career ending, nearly injury, who really wasn't very good as a

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:29.640
man, like he wasn't even lifting a national level in New Zealand went instead. So that just shows

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:33.000
you the incredible difference that there is between men and women and the things it's very

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.600
visible, like Laurel Hubbard doesn't look like a woman. Of course he doesn't look like a woman,

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:42.440
he's not a woman. And he's standing there as this rather out of shape man on a podium in a local

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:46.680
competition. And there's these girls who are two of the world's strongest women on either side

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:53.080
in second per place. So sport gets there because men get it, they don't feel like attacking them.

01:16:54.040 --> 01:17:00.760
It's so visible. So absurd, so absurd. We are living in the age of the absurd, I feel like.

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:06.200
I sort of feel like we went into a parallel universe sometime around 2015 and I wish we

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:10.680
could get out of it again. Like, I used to do sensible things. I used to talk about actual

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:15.960
genuine policy problems. Like this isn't a real policy problem. Like if the first person, the first

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:20.520
man who ever said, I feel like I'm a woman and I want to compete in women's sports have been told,

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:26.760
no, no, no again. No, because it's so stupid, don't be ridiculous, go and compete with your

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:32.120
own sex. And we had never started, it would all have been fine. But now all of us are having to

01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:37.640
work so hard to regain ground that should never have been lost. And again, these are just the

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:41.560
high profile examples. I'm very sorry for those girls from the Pacific Island. At least they're

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:45.240
not locked up with a rapist, which is happening in women's prisons right now.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:54.040
That is horrific, the fact that a man who has a criminal record can just say, I feel like a woman

01:17:54.040 --> 01:18:01.880
and, you know, heaven is moved just so he can be transferred into a woman's prison

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:09.800
to be put with women who he then rapes. And I understand that there is a man who identifies

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:15.400
as a woman, he was transferred into a women's prison, and he got two women pregnant by raping

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:19.960
them. And well, I mean, who knows whether it was consensual, but I mean, what does consensual

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:25.000
mean in prison? Like they can't get away from him, you know? Like these are very vulnerable

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:30.280
women. I mean, people often don't know this if they haven't ever looked at it. I mean, I often say

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:35.080
that the place that you see sex differences most clearly is obviously in the labor ward.

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:41.880
But the second place behind that where you see sex differences most clearly is in crime or in prison.

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:47.480
So I know the figures for the UK and I did look up the figures for the US and they're not massively

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:52.760
different. I mean, you imprison a whole lot more people than we do. But as a share of men and women,

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:58.920
what I'm saying for the UK holds roughly for the US. So about 7% of people who get admitted to

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:04.760
prison every year in this country are women and 93% are men. Now the women overwhelmingly commit

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:10.280
nonviolent crimes and get short sentences. So at any given time, about 4% of prison are women.

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:16.440
And the rest are men. Of the women, I think it's about 4% again have committed any sort of violent

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:22.920
crime. Of the men, it's it's God, it's 20% or 40%. I now can't remember which. Of the women,

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:28.360
it's less than 100 committed sexual crime and overwhelmingly that's non contact crimes. So

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:32.680
terrible things like helping to create child porn. But it's not things that make you physically

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:37.880
dangerous to the other people in prison with you. Of the men, it's 19% committed sexual crimes and

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:43.880
they were violent crimes and mostly against women. So you've got thousands and thousands of men

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:48.120
in men's prisons, who are there because they committed violent crimes against women,

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:53.400
and 100 women who committed nonviolent crimes, not against the sort of people who are locked up at

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:59.960
all. So you just need a few of those men to identify as women. And I mean, the incentive is high,

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:04.440
like if you're going to get transferred and you're a rapist. And then on top of that, you remember

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:10.760
that almost no rapes are even reported. Like plausibly at most one rape in 100 even gets as

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:17.000
far as a trial, let alone a conviction. So if you look at the men who were in prison, to have proven

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:21.960
that, you know, they are willing to do anti social and illegal things, a lot of them are going to be

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:27.160
rapists, but not actually in there for rape. Like they raped somebody and nobody knows. So even if

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:31.000
you say I'll keep the rapists out, if you transfer any men, there's a good chance you're transferring

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.320
a rapist, or you're going to transfer somebody who hasn't raped yet, but given the opportunity,

01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:39.640
he will. And then the last thing that's worth saying about people who are in prison is that the

01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:44.760
women are nearly people who have been victimized and far worse than the crime they committed

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:52.200
themselves. So most women who were in prison have experienced at least one domestic violence, sexual

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:59.160
crime, child abuse, and they've been in coercive relationships with men, like often all of those

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:06.280
things. And they are deeply vulnerable people, you know, they often obviously they're also criminals,

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:10.040
so they can be nightmares as well as very vulnerable people. But they are they're very,

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:14.840
very, very vulnerable people, they find a presence of men often very triggering. And then you've got

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:22.440
these men of whom literally at any one time, you know, cut out, I don't know, 20,000 of them

01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:26.360
already committed a serious sexual crime against a woman and a whole load more

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:31.000
use their fists to solve problems. And that's who you think you can transfer into women's prisons.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:37.160
Insane. Insane. And wicked. It's actually wicked. It's worse than insane.

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:42.040
I agree. I agree. There's something really sinister about this movement and

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:49.080
these policies that, you know, trans activists are pushing. And I hope I hope that people

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:55.560
come away from this conversation with a little bit more understanding about the ideology that's

01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:03.240
being pushed. I hope they understand that you and I are in no way homophobic, we're in no way

01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:12.840
against people living good lives. But we want to be connected to reality. We cannot keep distorting

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:20.440
reality in order to appease some fringe minority that's very aggressive and uncomfortable to deal

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:27.560
with. And that is difficult. People are facing this in all sorts of fields, you know, in their

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:34.920
workplace and all sorts of places. But I think having the facts is important. And I think remembering

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:42.360
that there is such a thing as objective reality. And we need to keep ourselves oriented to it.

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.320
Because if we don't, it could be very, very dangerous.

01:22:46.040 --> 01:22:49.960
And even if people think like, you know, what's the harm in a bit of delusion? I mean,

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:53.320
I don't think I think there's a lot of harm in delusion, actually. But even if you are someone

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:58.440
who thinks that one of the trans activists slogans is be kind, they think that people like me are

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:03.640
very unkind. Well, listen to what I said about what they're doing to children. And listen to what I

01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:08.600
said about what they're doing to deeply vulnerable women in prison, moving rapists and potential

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:17.080
rapists and unknown rapists, very violent, and ask yourself what's kind. It isn't kind to go along

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:22.040
with an ideology that causes so much harm, and that causes so much harm to very vulnerable people.

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:26.840
And that ends up with gay kids thinking that they're meant to be the opposite sex and therefore

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:32.520
getting sterilized. Like that's a human rights abuse at a major scale, major medical scandal.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:39.480
It's not none of this is kind. So I know that I sound unkind to people who desperately want

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:47.480
reality to not be as it is. But when you lie to people about what's real, you end up being deeply,

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:55.720
deeply unkind. I agree. I agree. And I look at it in the sense of if I'm dealing with a child,

01:23:55.720 --> 01:24:02.520
sometimes you need to be a little unkind to the child to keep them safe. And that's okay. In the

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:08.760
long run, that is the kind thing to do. So it's not kind to duck the difficult conversation. It's

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:14.040
very unkind. Like if a child says to you, you know, I want to eat ice cream for every meal,

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:19.800
deeply unkind to let them do it. And this is so much more serious. The harms are so much worse.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:24.040
Absolutely. Absolutely. Helen, where can people find your work?

01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:31.160
So I have a website that HelenJoyce.com. And I also tweet more than I probably should at Joyce

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:36.360
Gender. And anyone who wants to look at the Critic Magazine website, I have a column there. It's a

01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:41.480
month magazine here in the UK. And but basically, if you search for me, you'll find me. And I've

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:45.720
done a lot of podcast interviews by this time. And you know what? I always learn from them. So

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:49.880
thank you for the concepts that you raised in this conversation. But if people want to listen

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:54.920
to more, I do have a list on my own website. But anyway, you just search for me. Wonderful. Wonderful.

01:24:54.920 --> 01:25:00.360
I really recommend people check out your book. I think it really sheds a lot of light and clarity

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:05.880
on this topic. And I just want to say thank you for all the work you are doing because it takes

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:10.680
a lot of bravery. And I really, really respect that. Thank you very much.
