00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Hi, everybody. Hello, hello.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Welcome. I'm so psyched to be here today.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Maybe before I even get started,

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
can I just get a show of hands?

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
If you're a creator, raise your hand.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Let's see, creators. Oh, my gosh. Yes.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Okay. If you're in the music industry,

00:19.000 --> 00:21.000
folks in the music industry, management companies, labels,

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
okay, great. Cool.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
And then how about if you're just in tech,

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
like anybody in tech, creator, economy, tech?

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
Okay, awesome. Cool. All right.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
So, I have a little cool mix of folks here today.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
I've been thinking a lot about the whole arc of the Internet

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
and how it's evolved over the last couple of decades,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
and then how I think it's going to evolve,

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
and Patreon's place in all of that.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
And that's what I want to share with you today.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
So, I started making music and videos

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
and putting them on the Internet right after I finished college

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
in 2007, and I made a ton of movies in school.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I also made animations as a kid,

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
so making stuff wasn't particularly new to me,

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
but I had just spent, at the time,

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
when I finished college, six months and thousands of hours

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
on a new record called Nightmares and Daydreams.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I was living at my dad's house at the time,

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
working out in my old childhood bedroom,

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
and I was trying to figure out how to reach people

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
with this new record that I had worked so hard on.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Like, even the cover, that guy on the cover

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
is an actual clay guy that I made out of Sculpey,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
and then I did a photo shoot with him,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
and I did a great job, but then I had to use the lasso tool

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
and Photoshop to cut him out,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
and this was before the magnetic lasso tool,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
so I had to do that shit by hand,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
and that took way too long, but none of that mattered,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
because by sheer luck, I happened to finish school

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
right when this budding technology called the Internet

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
was going through a massive shift.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
It was just starting to move from what people called Web 1

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
to Web 2.0.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Sure, everybody knows about this in this room.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
You all are here at South by Southwest, so you probably know this,

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
but Web 1 was essentially a read-only version of the Internet.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
In retrospect, people call this 90s version of the Web

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
the static Web.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
It was like AOL, where you could browse Web pages

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
and read the news, but there was no easy way

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
for people to upload and share,

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
and then in the early 2000s,

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
a slew of new companies like YouTube and Facebook

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
and Twitter came onto the scene,

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
and YouTube's motto was broadcast yourself.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
The whole idea of Web 2

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
was that for the first time as a creative person,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
you could easily participate on the Internet.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
You could post and tweet and upload

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
instead of just being a passenger,

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
and I thought that was fucking awesome.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
Honestly, I still think it's fucking awesome.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
It's so easy to forget how magical this is,

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
how special this is,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
but this moment in history marked a shift

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
for humanity and for artists and creators especially,

02:37.000 --> 02:40.000
because for the first time on the Internet,

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
you could do more than just consume.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
You could create.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
You could reach other people,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
and it was in that moment,

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
right here in 2007, when I had to graduate college

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
and finish my record, Nightmares and Daydreams,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
and I was trying to reach people with it,

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
and at the time, my best bet was DMing bands on Myspace

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
and asking if I could open for them

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
at local bars up and down the West Coast.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I sent cold outreach to music venues to get booked,

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
and then I got in my car because I couldn't afford to rent a van,

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
and I drove up and down the West Coast to the United States,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
and I played the dankest local bars,

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
and I sang my guts out,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
and I sweated, and I sang, and I sweated, and I sang,

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
and I ate tacos out of the back of my car

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
while my friends were all getting promoted

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
in high-paying jobs as investment bankers,

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
for years, tour after tour,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
and I'm using the word tour lightly here.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Like, there weren't people at my shows.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
Like, nobody came!

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I had no fans!

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
On a good night, there were a couple stragglers

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
who wanted in off the street,

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
but I was playing empty bars.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
It was so hard to reach people.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
So you can imagine how excited I was

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
when a friend sent me a video of a guy named David Choi

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
singing with a guitar in front of his webcam

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
on a new website called YouTube.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
And this video had, like, 300,000 views

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
or something like that.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
I couldn't believe it! David was reaching people!

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
This phase of the internet had the potential

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
to solve a fundamental problem for me as an artist.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I felt like I had to jump in, and I did.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I immediately started uploading videos to YouTube.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Back then, no one else was showing

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
the, like, at-home recording process,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
so I just filmed myself playing instruments,

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
and then I layered them in the video with split screens

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
so people could see all the musical elements

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
coming together to form a song.

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
And it's funny, because in 2023, this idea seems totally obvious,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
but nobody was doing that back then.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
It wasn't a fancy recording studio

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
with millions of dollars' equipment.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
It was a bedroom with an M-Box audio interface

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
and a cheap version of a laptop recording software

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
called Pro Tools LE and an old Sony handicap

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
that I lugged around with me everywhere

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
that shot on high eight tapes

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
and a bed comforter humming on the wall

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
to dampen the sound and broken cymbals

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
but I was making real music.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
I was screaming my fucking guts out

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
and playing accordion and doing collabs with friends

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
and it started working.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
People started watching my videos and listening to my music.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
I was reaching people.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
My videos started getting thousands of views.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
It wasn't millions of people at first,

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
but it was so much better than playing empty bars.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
So I kept doing it.

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
And by 2009, I had made 43 YouTube videos of my songs

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
and I was feeling amazing

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
and the first time in my life,

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
I was actually reaching people with my work.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Okay, but the real beauty

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
of this new website called YouTube,

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
the most amazing thing about it,

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
was that it had a subscribe button.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
I only realized how truly special

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
this idea was in retrospect.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
But in my opinion, this concept turned out to be

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
one of the most important things

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
about this new era of the internet,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
called Web 2.0.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
The subscribe button was foundational.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
It changed YouTube from being a tool to reach people,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
to being a way to reach them

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
and then build a following around my work.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
The subscribe button allowed people who liked my stuff

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
to sign up to see more of it in the future.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
And as a creator, it gave me a channel of distribution

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
to ensure that my future work was sent to those people.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
So it turned out that Web 2 solved more than just reach,

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
more than just discovery.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
It represented the birth of the follower.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
In my opinion, the follow is not some handy feature

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
of a social network.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
The follow is foundational architecture

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
for human creativity and organization.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
The idea of a creator, an artist, or a community of fans

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
around them who want to see their future work,

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
this concept, the follow, it's profound.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Whether it's the following that I was building as a musician

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
or a podcasting duo who talks about what it's like

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
to be single moms in a community of single mothers

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
who finally feel seen and understood

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
or a science education creator and students

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
who didn't previously have access to high quality education,

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
the follow was a system of organization

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
for the entire internet.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
It was a framework for the distribution of creativity

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
and communication, not just reach,

06:59.000 --> 07:02.000
but a step past it, ongoing communication,

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
connection, a sustained relationship, community.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And I learned just how magical the concept of the following could be

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
when I did my first collab with my girlfriend Natalie.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
We put up a video on my YouTube channel in 2008

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
that was a song we created together,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
and it was different than my music.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
It was way less screamy and insane,

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
but it was more active and fleshed out than her music,

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
so we decided to create a new separate channel for our collabs

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
and we called this new YouTube channel, Pomplimus.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Oh, all right, got some Pomplimus fans in the house, all right.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
But we posted our first video,

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
the first Pomplimus video was actually posted on my channel,

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
and I had about 7,000 subscribers at the time,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
and my subscribers loved this new video.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
And at the end of it, we posted a little link

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
to the new Pomplimus channel to tell people about it,

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
and almost instantly, the new Pomplimus channel

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
got 3,000 subscribers.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
That's what a following is.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
People see your new shit, literally they follow you,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
wherever you go on the internet.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
So Natalie and I started making more videos and more videos,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
and within a year, we got 18,000 subscribers,

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
and then in one video, we announced that we were playing a show,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
and we showed up to the show in San Francisco,

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
and there were 40 people there, and oh my God, guys,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
I cannot tell you what it's like to have 40 people at your show

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
after years of playing empty bars.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
Fucking magic. It was amazing.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
It was so great.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
That night was such a great night.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
I feel like I literally can remember that.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Another time, Natalie and I were filming a vlog

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
to put in one of our videos,

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
and my sister happened to walk in behind us,

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
and she was holding a bar.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
She's a soap maker.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
She was holding a bar of grapefruit-scented soap.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Pomplimus means grapefruit in French.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
And she said, hey, guys, look, I have Pomplimus soap.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.000
And Natalie and I just saw that and decided to keep it in the video,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
and we put it up in the video,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
and our fans were like, oh my God, Pomplimus soap.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
We want a bar of Pomplimus soap.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
So we made another video, and we said, okay,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
now you can order Pomplimus soap,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
and we got hundreds of orders for Pomplimus soap.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
Another time, when USB thumb drives were starting to get huge,

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
we thought, why do CDs?

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Let's put all of our music on a thumb drive.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
And so we did.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And we loaded up the thumb drives.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
We put up a video. We said, hey, if you want to buy a thumb drive,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
you can buy a thumb drive now.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
And we ended up selling hundreds and hundreds of thumb drives.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
We decided to sign every one of them,

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
and it was really personal with our fans.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
And it was kind of crazy.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
We had to figure out the packaging.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
We had no idea how to package that many thumb drives.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
My family ended up helping out.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
My parents were freaking out.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Dad's taking pictures and stuff.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
It was really fun. It was amazing.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.000
Another time, we decided to put our album on iTunes,

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
our first Pomplimus album back in 2008,

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
and we didn't have artwork.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
So we asked our fans, hey, do you want to make the artwork

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
for a Pomplimus?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
And we got hundreds of submissions for the cover

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
of the new Pomplimus album from our fans.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
And they were freaking talented.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Their artwork was amazing.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
This is the one that actually won.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Natalie and I just love this one.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
So this is the artwork for our first album.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
It was made by one of our fans.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Another time, we booked a show at a laundromat.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
That's a sentence I just said.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
We booked a show at a laundromat.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
The idea was like as a laundromat,

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
you could go order food, do your laundry,

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
eat by the time you're done eating, take your laundry home.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
That was the idea of a laundromat.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
And we booked the show.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
If you crammed people in there,

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
it held 60 people in this laundromat.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
And then we uploaded this video.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
And this was the first video that we ever uploaded

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
that went viral.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
And it got like half a million views overnight,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
and we showed up to our show at the laundromat,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
and there were 200 people crammed inside the laundromat.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
And then 150 or 200 people outside,

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
like spilling in the street, cars were swerving around them.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
And like there was no stage.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Like it's a laundromat.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
So literally, I'm playing music, and there's a person.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Like I'm like looking out of person's eyes

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
while I'm playing pompomous songs.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
It was insane.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Honestly, it was the first night.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
It was mayhem.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
I don't have any pictures of the night,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
but this is what it felt like.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Like it was just like insane.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
And this was the first time I was like,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
oh my God, this is going to work.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Like having a following is amazing.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
This is going to work.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
We're going to be able to be full-time musicians.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
Another time we posted another video.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
And at the end of the video, we told our fans,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
hey, we're uploading a song to iTunes.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.000
We decided not to ever sign or kind of enter the music industry.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
We did everything ourselves.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
We negotiated our own contract with iTunes directly.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
We posted our songs directly to iTunes.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
And so we kept almost, you know,

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
all of the revenue associated with that.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
And when we posted this album,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
told our fans about it online, told our followers,

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
we sold 30,000 songs that month.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
And we got $22,000 deposited directly into our bank account.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
It was more money than I'd ever seen in one place,

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
ever in my life.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
I was losing my mind.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
It was so incredible.

11:55.000 --> 12:02.000
Then Pompomoo started playing shows,

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
and we started touring.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
And, you know, hundreds of people started showing up.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
And then many hundreds of people,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
and then thousands of people started showing up.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
And this is my wife, Crowdsurfing,

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
because she's a fucking badass.

12:14.000 --> 12:21.000
And that's what I mean when I say that the subscribe button

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
is not a silly feature.

12:25.000 --> 12:30.000
The concept of the follow changed my life.

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
It made my dreams come true as an artist.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
It took me from playing empty bars

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
to living out my fantasy as a musician.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
The follow is a piece of internet architecture

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
that felt closer to magic than anything

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
I had ever experienced in my life.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Right around the moment that Pompomoo was starting to work,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
right through all of this,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
there is this genius named Kevin Kelly.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Has anybody heard of Kevin Kelly?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
Founder of Wired, yeah, a bunch of people.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Okay, amazing thinker and mind.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
He wrote an essay called A Thousand True Fans.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
And his premise was simple.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
It was that in the age of the internet,

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
you don't need millions of fans to be successful.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
If you can just find a thousand people

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
who are willing to buy 100 bucks of stuff from you per year,

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
that's $100,000 per year,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
which is a pretty freaking great business as a creative person.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
You just need a thousand true fans

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
who really connect with you and believe in you.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
And this is different than just reaching people.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
It's even deeper than followers.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
This is super fans, true fans, real fans.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Call it whatever you want.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
The idea is that there's this group of people that is your core.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.000
If reach means people see it,

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
and follower means people want to see more,

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
then true fans are the people who go to the shows

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
and buy the merch and download the record

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
and pay for the course and get the live stream tickets

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
and all the things.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
And this idea really resonated with me.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
We had fans showing up to Pompomoo shows

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
with tattoos of the band.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
We had fans literally making custom t-shirts

14:10.000 --> 14:16.000
of Pompomoo posters, drawings, artwork, cookies.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
We had a fan do icing of my face on a cookie.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
I ate my face.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
We had a fan who made an oil painting

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
and me screaming my fucking guts out.

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
I learned HTML and I had a little website.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
I used this link release software called eJunkie

14:34.000 --> 14:37.000
and I cobbled together like a little MP3 store

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
for myself on the internet.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
I would sell original music and I was selling 500 bucks a month

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
of my original songs on my own website

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
with my own shitty thing that I made.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
Fans were showing up to buy things, to be there.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
One time we asked our Pompomoo fans

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
to come film a music video with us on a Saturday,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
like show up to Dolores Park in San Francisco,

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
show up and be in this music video.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
50 people showed up.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
They even learned this dance.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
We shot this dance.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
The dance is in this Pompomoo's video.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Another time we would actually always use this software

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
called Stage It, which is like a ticketed live stream software.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
We could play our songs.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
People could buy tickets and show up live on the internet.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Natalie and I would just sit at home

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
and play these songs for 45 minutes

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
and people would buy tickets and leave tips during the concert

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
and we would routinely make like three grand

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
in 45 minutes playing our songs.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
It's like these are true fans.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.000
Another time Natalie raised over $100,000

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
for her record from just 2,000 people.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.000
Another time we made a Pompomoo's album

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
and we went online on YouTube.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
We put up this video and we said,

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
hey, everybody, we have a new Pompomoo's album.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
It's not for sale.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
You can't buy it.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
You can't get the new Pompomoo's album.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
The only way to get the new Pompomoo's album

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
is if you donate a book to the Richmond School District

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
and then send us the receipt for that book

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
and we will send you the Pompomoo's album for free.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
Just donate a book.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
It's super easy.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
We'll send you the album in the mail for free.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
And the Richmond School District

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
ended up having to rent a shipping container

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
to keep up with the packages.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
It's like 11,000 books that got sent to the Richmond School.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
It's like $140,000 worth of books.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
It was amazing.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
It felt incredible to see that many people show up for this.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.000
That's true fans, real fans, super fans.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Call it whatever you want.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
But this was the concept that was rattling around in my head

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
when I started Patreon 11 years ago.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
This is actually the first sketch of Patreon.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
I called up my co-founder and he turned this

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
into what is now Patreon.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
And the idea was very simple.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
It's like a membership platform

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
where fans could sign up for a subscription payment

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
to the creator and the creator could run a membership

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
and get paid for their work.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I'm not going to tell the Patreon founding story.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
I've told it a million times.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
But the company is now over 400 people, 11 years in.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
We have over 250,000 creators

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
who have made over $3.5 billion on the platform,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
which I think of as proof, if we ever needed it,

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
that the true fans are there and the true fans are ready.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
Okay.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
In the background, while Patreon was being formed,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
building over the last decade,

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
the whole internet was again starting to shift.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.000
And if you think of the 90s as Web 1 and the 2000s as Web 2,

17:38.000 --> 17:42.000
right around the 2010s, there was a new change happening.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
Facebook started experimenting with a new thing called ranking.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
And I realize most everybody here knows about this.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Ranking did was essentially it took the feed,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
which you can think of as a list of posts from creators that I follow,

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
and it analyzed each and every post for how engaging it was.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
And if it wasn't engaging enough,

17:59.000 --> 18:04.000
Facebook would then take that post and push it down in the feed.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
In other words, they started ranking or ordering posts

18:06.000 --> 18:09.000
according to what was best for their business.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
This was actually great for Facebook.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
It was the right business decision for them and their company

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
and their revenue model.

18:17.000 --> 18:22.000
But what it meant for creators was that for the first time since Web 2.0,

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
my followers might not necessarily see my posts.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
And this idea of a subscription started to break down.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
If the person doesn't receive the things,

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
it's not really a direct true connection between a creator and their fans.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
It's not really a subscription.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
The channel of distribution is broken.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
And it creates another problem too around creative freedom,

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
because now suddenly, my post has to be better than the other posts,

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
according to a set of criteria that I don't know or have control of

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
or even agree with.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
So instead of thinking, what do I want to make?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
What lights me up?

18:57.000 --> 19:00.000
What is the output that I want to create as an artist?

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
What will my fans love?

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
Instead of thinking those questions, now in the back of my mind,

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
I'm thinking, what will the ranking algorithm favor?

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
And that subconsciously or consciously changes my creative output

19:12.000 --> 19:18.000
to achieve Facebook's goals, not my goals as a creator.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.000
And if it were just Facebook doing this, fine,

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
creators would just leave and post somewhere else.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
But it worked really well.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
It was great for Facebook's business.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.000
And people started spending even more time on the platform.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
So the other platforms had to compete.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
And YouTube launched the Cosmic Panda redesign,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
centering the entire company around watch time.

19:39.000 --> 19:42.000
And Twitter and Instagram followed with ranked feeds in 2016.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
And we only saw it in retrospect.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
But now I think of the 2010s as the decade of ranking,

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
the decade when the original promise of the creator-led community,

19:52.000 --> 19:57.000
the true follow was broken for the first time.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
I want to just do a quick aside here,

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
because I know there's this big debate in the world

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
about chronological feeds versus algorithmic feeds.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
And I don't want to make it sound like I'm a zealot

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
on either of the two polarized sides.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
It's actually not the takeaway here.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
It's not how I think of it.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
I actually see problems with chronological feeds,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
because as a creator, if it's chronological,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
then you have to keep posting to stay on top.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
So I don't think that's necessarily the best way

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
to build strong relationships either.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
The problem that I have is if you're going to change that,

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
if you're going to adjust the way you create a feed,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
what is the purpose behind that?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
What is the intention behind that?

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Are you trying to create a place

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
where you can build strength of relationship

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
with your community,

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
where your fandom gets energized over time,

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
where people are guaranteed that subscription,

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
where you get a direct connection with your community

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
and your true fans?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Is that it?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Or is it maximizing attention?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Is it maximizing watch time?

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Those are two very different goals

20:55.000 --> 20:57.000
and very different ways of organizing

20:57.000 --> 21:00.000
your entire product as a technology company.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
This one helps me as a creator,

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
and this one hurts me as a creator.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.000
It hurts my community.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
It hurts my business.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
It hurts my creative output.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
I wish that it stopped there,

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
but around the turn of the decade,

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
a new company came onto the scene called TikTok,

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
and TikTok had a much deeper impact on the ecosystem

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I think anyone foresaw at the time.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
It wasn't just short form vertical first video.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
That wasn't it.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
That's a red herring, I think.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
It was much more fundamental than that.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
TikTok said,

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
we want to make the most engaging feed possible.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
This whole idea of a list of your subscriptions,

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
forget about that.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
In fact, forget about the whole concept of subscriptions.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
TikTok started from the ground up

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
with something totally different called For You,

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
where each of these posts are chosen for me by TikTok

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
instead of me choosing what's in my feed,

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
and this completely abandoned the concept of the follow.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
But it worked.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
TikTok had a billion users by 2021,

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
and traffic on the internet started flowing away

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
from the legacy social companies and toward TikTok.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
So just like with Facebook and ranking,

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
the other platforms had to compete.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
YouTube launched shorts,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
Instagram launched reels,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
and Twitter launched a For You feed as well,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
and within a couple of years,

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
this whole system of organization for the internet,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
the creator-led community,

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
started to fade into the past.

22:29.000 --> 22:34.000
I have really felt this personally as a creator

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
in the last four years, especially.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
My fans don't see as much of my stuff anymore.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
It's harder to sell tickets to a show.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
It's harder to reach people with my new work.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
It's harder to build community.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
It's harder to build a business.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
It's harder to energize my fans.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
I was curious for the creators and the audience.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
Are you feeling this too?

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
Are folks in the room feeling this?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I'm seeing nodding heads, raised hands.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Yes, okay.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
This is, I just feel it.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
What's happening here is we are in the middle of another shift,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
and this is a big one.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
If the 90s was Web 1,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
and the 2000s was Web 2,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
and the 2010s was ranking,

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
I'm worried that the 2020s

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
could become the death of the follower.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
I got an email from a creator

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
that I was spending a lot of time with

23:27.000 --> 23:30.000
a little while ago, about a year and a half ago,

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
and I got this email in my heart,

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
just sank in my stomach.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Can we get the slide up? Great.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Hey, Jack.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
I'm writing this letter to you hat in hand

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
due to changes at Facebook.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
Overnight, the traffic to my links in my page

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
is dropped by 80%.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
As such, it looks like I'll have to sell my home.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
I'm dusting off my resume

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
and looking for jobs in social media management.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
This is now,

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
I'm seeing more and more of things like this,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
and it's not just happening to creators.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
It's happening to anyone who posts stuff on the internet.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
It's happening to media companies.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
Look at what's happening to Vice and Buzzfeed

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
and Rooster Teeth's announcement a couple of weeks ago.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
This is a really hard change to navigate

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
for anyone who's posting stuff online

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
and trying to build community and business.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
For the creators in the room,

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
I think it's really important to remember that

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
and to understand that.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
If you're not connecting

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
as much as you want to with your audience right now,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
that does not necessarily mean

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
there's something wrong with you.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
A lot of us as creators have this tendency to be like,

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
what can I do better?

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
And that's a good impulse, honestly.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
It's like growth mindset.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
How am I contributing to this?

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
What can I do better?

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
And again, I think most of the time that's really good,

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
but there is also something happening in the background right now.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
It's a macro thing that's happening on the web

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
that makes our jobs as creators really hard right now.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
There's a lot of smart people at big companies

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
that are well-funded, big media companies,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
trying to figure this out too,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
and they're having trouble with it too.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
So as creators, just know that.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
It doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong with you here.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
I believe that this problem is the single most important problem

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
that faces creative people today.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
The weakening of creator-led communities,

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
of our distribution channels to our fans.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
This is the hardest, most challenging,

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
and most painful issue threatening the present

25:30.000 --> 25:33.000
and the future of creativity on the internet.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.000
So I want to be very clear about this.

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
I actually, I don't think that this is going to happen.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.000
I don't think that we're actually going to see the real death of the follower.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
That's not what I think is going to happen.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
I think the follow is too important to die.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
I think it's too valuable to ignore.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.000
I think it's too useful and awesome for creative people,

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
for publishers, for media companies,

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
and I think the next wave of internet

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
and media technology companies are going to surge on this problem

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
and try to solve it.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
And it's actually already started.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
And the incumbents of the audience

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
are not going to be able to fight it

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
because their revenue relies on maximizing attention.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
To drive their businesses, they're being forced up

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
towards discovery, towards reach, personalization, algorithmic curation.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
These are the levers that drive attention

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
and therefore they drive their strategies.

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
That's why there's a whole already opening up

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
and why we're starting to see a whole new set of companies emerge

26:31.000 --> 26:34.000
that look fundamentally different from the legacy social landscape.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Discord and Kajabi and Fourth Wall and Gumroad Moment,

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
which Patreon acquired last year.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
The Courses Platforms, Events Companies.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
Some people are calling this subset of companies the creator economy.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I don't even think of it like that.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
It's a fundamental shift in approach.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
And the hallmark strategy of the drivers of these businesses

26:53.000 --> 26:56.000
is the focus on deeper connections,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
as opposed to just more connections.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
The true fan, the real fan, call it whatever you want.

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
It's the 5% of fans that drive 90% of the community and business.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
This is a direct to fan business.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
This is an ads business.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
This is about depth of connection.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
This is about maximizing attention.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
This is about deeper fans.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
This is about more fans.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
And what binds this new wave of emerging companies

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
is that their strategic focus is down here.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
The next decade of creative and media technology companies

27:26.000 --> 27:29.000
will focus on building direct to fan connections

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
and community strength.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.000
As creators, we'll still need the social platforms.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
We'll still need those companies up here for discovery, for reach.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
We need that.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
But those companies will be one component

27:42.000 --> 27:45.000
of the many tools that we have as creative people

27:45.000 --> 27:48.000
to help us run our communities and businesses.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
That's where the world is going.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
I'm sure of it.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
And personally, right now,

27:57.000 --> 28:02.000
I feel a sense of responsibility through this.

28:02.000 --> 28:05.000
I feel a sense of responsibility because

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
I remember what it feels like to be a creator

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
on the outside of these platforms,

28:11.000 --> 28:14.000
watching the internet move in a direction

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
that I don't agree with and that I don't like

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
and that I don't think is good for my community and my business.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
I remember what that feels like.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
I remember feeling anxiety.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I remember feeling fear.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
I remember feeling scared of where that was going

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
and what it meant for me.

28:30.000 --> 28:34.000
And now, through whatever crazy life path

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
I have been on as an artist,

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
I'm now finding myself as a CEO

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
of one of these fucking tech companies

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
and I feel this sense of

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
I want to help build the type of internet

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
that I want as a creator.

28:53.000 --> 28:57.000
That's what I want to do.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
So I really don't want this talk to feel like a Patreon ad.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Actually, I really hope it doesn't.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
But I do want to give you a sense

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
of how I'm thinking about this problem

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
given this seat that I'm in

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
and how Patreon is now thinking about this problem

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
and what we think our place is in it

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
and what we want to do about it.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.000
And the headline is this.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
It's been 20 or 30 years.

29:24.000 --> 29:30.000
And the current version of how art and community

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
exists on the internet today,

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
I don't think is the right version.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
How community and art exists on the web.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
I don't think it's the right way.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.000
And I want Patreon to contribute

29:45.000 --> 29:47.000
to building a better version

29:47.000 --> 29:50.000
of how art and community could exist on the internet.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
We've oriented the whole company

29:53.000 --> 29:58.000
around this problem.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
And we've been building a lot in the background

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
over the last couple of years,

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
but we made some big announcements a couple of months ago

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
about the next phase of Patreon

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
and how we're thinking about this problem.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.000
Specifically, we started as a membership platform

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
11 years ago, subscription payments.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
But we have built a lot,

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
especially in the last three years,

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
in an effort to take a more holistic approach

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
to building this.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
We built video, community, podcasting,

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
better posting, a new media player, commerce,

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
free membership, which is essentially like a follow

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
gated on an email and live.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
And while this might look like a lot,

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
it's actually just three things,

30:34.000 --> 30:37.000
media, community, and business.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
And we're now thinking of Patreon

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
no longer as a membership platform,

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
where we started,

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
but as this whole thing,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
the media, community, and business foundation

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
for the next decade of professional creativity

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
on the internet,

30:51.000 --> 30:54.000
organized around the concept of the true follow

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
in an effort to build a better way

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
that art can exist on the web.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
That's the theory.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.000
That's what the company is setting out to solve now.

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
And in practice, what that looks like

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
is a new set of products and tools

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
that we built into Patreon.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.000
This is our first foray into community.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
And essentially this allows fans

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
to connect with each other

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
and build energized fandoms

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
and creators to hop in there and talk with fans.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
It's a place for true fandom.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
Why do we build this?

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
What's the thinking? What's the strategy

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
and the idea behind this? Here's why.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
As a creator on the internet today,

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
I can get subscribers and I can get views

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
and if I can send my fans to Instagram

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
or TikTok and they can be there,

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
but what I've noticed is those communities

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
degrade over time.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
They don't get energized over time.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
They get de-energized.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
It gets harder and harder to reach those people.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
I make a post. I reach 2% of my audience.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
I reach 1% of my audience.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
I lose touch with those people

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
and there's no way for me to find

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
those real fans, those true fans,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
the small portion of my fans

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
that drive everything for me as a creator.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
The way we're building this

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
and what I want as a creator

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
is a place where I can send my fans

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
and that fandom gets energy over time.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
That fandom gets closer.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
That fandom gets more vibrant,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
more connected over time,

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
more enthusiastic over time.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
That's what I want as a creator.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
That's the space that I want to have

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
as a creative person.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Creators deserve a place like that.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
That is important.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
It's important for the future of creativity.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Another thing that we built

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
is commerce.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
Commerce allows creators

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
to sell a digital thing,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
anything that you can sell online,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
any digital thing.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Why did we build this? Why did we build commerce?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Because

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
creators

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
send lots of people to their Patreon,

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
millions of people to their Patreon pages every month.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
What we found is

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
a lot of those people are true fans.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
They're like the really intense,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
interested, excited fans.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
But not all of those fans

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
are ready to pay with a subscription payment.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
In fact, a lot of them don't want to pay

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
with a subscription payment.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
A lot of them.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Why? Why don't they want to pay with a subscription payment?

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Either they have subscription fatigue,

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
which is a real thing,

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
or they're not in the right financial situation,

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
or they don't want to commit to a payment every month.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
But they're still true fans.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
Rather than having those true fans

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
leave the creator,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
we want to give creators a way

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
to start forming connections with those fans,

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
to build businesses with those fans.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
We built commerce as a way

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
to participate in the creator's business

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
and community through this commerce product.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Meanwhile, the creator can build

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
an awesome business along the way, too.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
The logic is very similar for free membership.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Why do we build free membership?

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
What is free membership, by the way?

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
Think of this as a follow gated on your email.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
It's kind of like an email capture,

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
almost, as a creator.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
It allows a fan to follow your page

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
without paying

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
in exchange for giving them your email.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
It's the same logic as commerce.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
They're sending their true fans millions

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
every month to their Patreon pages.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
And we wanted to give creators a way

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
to reach that portion of their fans

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
that they go to the shows,

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
they have the merch, they have the hat.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
They're true fans, but for whatever reason,

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
they don't want to buy one of the things you have digitally,

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
and they don't want to pay a subscription.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
And this allows creators

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
to continue forming relationships with those fans.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
And what's super exciting about this

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
is we have found that about 40 to 50%

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
of these fans

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
actually say

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
that they intend to pay the creator

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
in the next few months.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
They have high intention

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
to be a part of the creators' community and business.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
And this gives creators a way

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
to start building community with those folks.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
Okay, we also

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
acquired a live experiences

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
platform called Moment.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
And I don't even

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
want to call it ticketed live streaming,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
because it's so much more beautiful than that.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
Arjun and the team did such an incredible job

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
of building this place

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
for creators to sell tickets

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
to these live experiences,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
and they can debut their work.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
A stand-up special, a movie that they've made,

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
a special episode

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
that they know is going to be a total banger,

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
whatever it is, it allows creators

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
to sell tickets to that experience

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
and then have community with those fans

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
while they're all watching it together.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
And they've launched amazing creators,

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Tam and Paula and Bieber,

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
and they've worked with folks like Arjun Schultz,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
to have that live community experience

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
and start gathering those community members

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
around their work.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Okay, so

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
all that to say,

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
the way we're thinking about it,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
and the way we're thinking about this next phase is that

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
we're not just a membership company anymore.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
We're a true fan company.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
We're a creator company.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
We're building a better way for art and community

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
to exist on the internet.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Because I want Patreon to build

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
an internet where creators have

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
true creative freedom.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
I want Patreon to contribute to a web

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
where creators have control of their businesses

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
and their careers.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
And I want it to feel like fire

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
to be part of a creator's community.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
I know what it feels like

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
to be part of an energized community.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I remember it.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
And I have that same conviction now

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
that I did back in 2013 when I started Patreon.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
I know that it is possible

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
to build an internet where fandoms thrive

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
and where professional creativity is possible

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
for anyone.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
I believe this in my bones.

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
It is not a choice.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
It's not optimism.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
It's just deep down what I actually know

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
to be available to humanity

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
if that is the path that we choose.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Okay.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
That's what Patreon is doing.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
It's how we're thinking about this future

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
and Patreon's place in it.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
But for the creators in the audience,

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
creators don't have to wait.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
Creators don't have to wait for this.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
Over the last decade,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
I've talked to thousands of creative people.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
I've had my own creative projects.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
I've learned a lot.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
And I want to share just a few thoughts

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
about navigating the shifts

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
in the internet

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
and how we can all

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
prepare ourselves

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
and our communities for those shifts.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
And we don't even need to wait

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
for any of the tech platforms

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
to catch up.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Can I get next slide?

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Great.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
The first,

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
invest in those true fans.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Invest in the depth of connection.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Not just new.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
It's not all about new views,

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
new subscribers, watch time up and to the right.

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
It's about depth.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
It's about quality of interaction.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
It's about finding that small portion of your fans

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
that are your engine,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
that are your core,

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
that are your core.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
And that's what I'm trying to reach them.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Sometimes when I talk about this,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
creators think,

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
does that mean like DMs?

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Should I be talking to individual fans?

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
No, not necessarily.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
That's not actually what I mean.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
Finding those people

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
and building real connections with them

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
in whatever capacity you have.

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
And my team will probably kill me for saying this.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
It's not even using Patreon.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
There's a bunch of ways that you can do this.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
I'm a little biased, but I think you could.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
You could find

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
some other place

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
where you can build that community

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
with your true fans.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
The point is find those people

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
and invest in that community.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
That is the engine that will drive your business,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
slingshot your business

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
through these shifts in the internet.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
Okay.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
The second thing,

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
make beautiful things.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
There is so much tension,

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
especially right now,

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
to make for the algorithm.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
And I've seen the diagrams.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
I've seen the charts.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
I've even drawn them in my history.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Make for the algorithm, make for yourself,

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
and then make the things that help you build a business.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
This is a Venn diagram, little center part,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
and that's the sweet part. I've seen all that.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
And I get that.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
But the gravity,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
the gravity,

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
everywhere we look as creators today,

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
the gravity is just pushing us.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
It's just pushing us toward

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
making for other reasons

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
than why we set out to make things in the first place.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
It's so important

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
to remember to make beautiful things,

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
to make things that light you up,

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
and to make things that you care about.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
There's a wonderful metaphor that I love.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
It's a business metaphor,

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
but it makes sense for creators too, I think.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
It's a metaphor of the business

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
of the hot dog stand under the Eiffel Tower,

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
or the local restaurant.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
And the hot dog stand in the Eiffel Tower

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
gets thousands of new customers

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
coming through their hot dog stand every day.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
It's just tourists just coming through.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
And they know they're going to get lots and lots of new customers,

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
and none of those people come back, but it doesn't matter,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
because they're just always getting new customers every day

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
because of the Eiffel Tower,

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
and they just make hot dogs and sell them,

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
and some portion of those customers buy their hot dogs.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
Actually, you don't even have to be very good hot dogs.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
They just sell hot dogs. They know they're going to keep making money.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
And that business works.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
Like, it works. It's an okay business.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
There's another business, which is the local restaurant business,

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
where the people there just focus on making

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
great food and having great service.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
And they actually are not in a place that gets a lot of foot traffic,

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
so they don't get lots of new customers,

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
but everybody in like a five-mile radius

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
eats there twice a month.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
And they just get lots of repeat customers

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
because they've built trust,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
and they've built depth of connection with those people,

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
and people know that restaurant

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
and love it and know they're going to have a great time

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
when they're there.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
That is a great business.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
You don't have to get lots of new

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
and billions and acquisition,

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
and you don't...

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
That's not the only type of business you can build as a creator.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
There's this wonderful group of creators

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
who are like, God, I've fallen in love with them.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Anybody heard of the YouTube New Wave?

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Has anybody heard of these folks seeing some hands?

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
It's this group of creators.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
They make these wonderful 30, 45-minute long form

41:04.000 --> 41:07.000
films, many documentaries

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
about their lives and their struggles

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
coming into the world and quitting college,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
and they're beautiful. It's incredible.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
They're patient, they're slow,

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
the films are long,

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
but, oh, my God,

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
the depth of the message

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
in these films is incredible,

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
and they're building such a strong community

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
around their work.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
People just love what they have to say

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
and wait to see the next one.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
That's a real business.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
That's a real community.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
It's different than what we're incentivized to do

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
everywhere on the Internet,

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
but that works.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Okay.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
The last thing.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
Ooh, that was loud.

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Know what you want.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
The hardest lesson I have learned

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
as a creative person

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
and as an operator and CEO

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
over the last 10 years

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
is to know

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
and trust what I want

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
and to be true to that over time.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
That's easier said than done.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Don't let somebody else

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
tell you what you want,

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
because then you'll end up with what they want

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
instead of what you want.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
I think a good example of that

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
is as creators,

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
we open up our dashboards

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
and we see

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
these metrics on what success is.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
This is a dashboard that someone else

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
built for us,

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
and it tells us what we want,

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
and the weird thing is after a couple of years,

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
we start to believe that.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
Our minds get reprogrammed

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
and we believe this is what I want.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
This is success,

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
and we chase that.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
If you went back in time

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
and you asked Ella Fitzgerald

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
or David Bowie or Prince,

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
what do you want?

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
What's your goal as an artist?

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
What matters to you?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Do you think Bowie would have said,

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
my goal as an artist

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
is to maximize

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
the amount of human hours

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
spent consuming my work?

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
I don't know

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
what Bowie wanted.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
I'm not going to pretend to,

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
but I can tell you what I want as an artist.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
I can tell you what matters to me

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
as a creative person,

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
and what I know will matter to me

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
10 years ago, now,

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
and 10 years from now.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
I want to say something

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
that matters to somebody.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.000
I want to say something that only I can say

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
because of whatever experience

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
I've had in my lived experience

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
something that is uniquely

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
pointed to me.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
I want to say that.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
I want to figure out how to say that.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
I want to find that core of human truth

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
in my experience

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
and communicate it eloquently and clearly

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
and have it be true and feel true

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
and have someone else see that

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
and have that person think,

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
yes, that feels true

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
and it feels true to them.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
And I want that person to feel connected to me

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
that I've never met before in our lives.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
But I said a thing that resonated with them

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
and made them feel a little bit less alone

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
because they felt like there was another person

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
who had that same experience.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
I want to make things that are timeless.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I want to make things that feel true now.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
I want to make things that feel true in 50 years.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
I want to make things that still feel true

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
500 years after I'm dead.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
I want to figure out how to use my

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
short years on this planet

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
to find that kind of truth and say it.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
That's what I want

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
as an artist.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
And that's a very different goal

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
than watch time.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
That may not be what you want

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
as an artist and that's okay.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
But the point is to know

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
what you want,

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
what matters to you,

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
what are you trying to achieve

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
as a creative person.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
We have this tendency to look outside

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
for those answers.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
I do it too.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
This advice is honestly more for me

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
than it is for anybody else in this room.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
We want there to be a Yoda.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
We want there to be a leader

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
or a manager or a voice of authority

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
that can tell us what we want

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
because it's a scary thing to ask.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
But that does not exist.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
What we want comes

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
intrinsically, not extrinsically.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
It comes from in here.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
That's where we find it.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
So as we navigate

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
this next phase of the internet

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
as creative people,

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
as we go through these ups and downs

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
of the web

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
in its ever-evolving state,

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
do not forget

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
what matters to you as an artist.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Do not forget what fills you

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
with pride to make.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Do not forget

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
your purpose for making things

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
in the first place.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
Don't forget why you wake up in the morning

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
and energy to your craft.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
Don't forget what gives you

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
a sense of meaning

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
as a creative person.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
And lastly,

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
don't forget to scream your fucking guts out.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Thank you, everybody. Appreciate you being here.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
Thank you.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
Thanks.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Thank you.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Thanks.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Thank you.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Thank you.
