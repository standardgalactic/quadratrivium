0	3000	Hi, everybody. Hello, hello.
6000	8000	Welcome. I'm so psyched to be here today.
8000	10000	Maybe before I even get started,
10000	12000	can I just get a show of hands?
12000	14000	If you're a creator, raise your hand.
14000	16000	Let's see, creators. Oh, my gosh. Yes.
16000	19000	Okay. If you're in the music industry,
19000	21000	folks in the music industry, management companies, labels,
21000	23000	okay, great. Cool.
23000	25000	And then how about if you're just in tech,
25000	27000	like anybody in tech, creator, economy, tech?
27000	29000	Okay, awesome. Cool. All right.
29000	32000	So, I have a little cool mix of folks here today.
32000	37000	I've been thinking a lot about the whole arc of the Internet
37000	40000	and how it's evolved over the last couple of decades,
40000	43000	and then how I think it's going to evolve,
43000	46000	and Patreon's place in all of that.
46000	49000	And that's what I want to share with you today.
49000	53000	So, I started making music and videos
53000	57000	and putting them on the Internet right after I finished college
57000	60000	in 2007, and I made a ton of movies in school.
60000	62000	I also made animations as a kid,
62000	64000	so making stuff wasn't particularly new to me,
64000	66000	but I had just spent, at the time,
66000	69000	when I finished college, six months and thousands of hours
69000	71000	on a new record called Nightmares and Daydreams.
71000	73000	I was living at my dad's house at the time,
73000	75000	working out in my old childhood bedroom,
75000	77000	and I was trying to figure out how to reach people
77000	80000	with this new record that I had worked so hard on.
80000	82000	Like, even the cover, that guy on the cover
82000	84000	is an actual clay guy that I made out of Sculpey,
84000	86000	and then I did a photo shoot with him,
86000	88000	and I did a great job, but then I had to use the lasso tool
88000	90000	and Photoshop to cut him out,
90000	92000	and this was before the magnetic lasso tool,
92000	94000	so I had to do that shit by hand,
94000	96000	and that took way too long, but none of that mattered,
96000	98000	because by sheer luck, I happened to finish school
98000	100000	right when this budding technology called the Internet
100000	103000	was going through a massive shift.
103000	106000	It was just starting to move from what people called Web 1
106000	108000	to Web 2.0.
108000	110000	Sure, everybody knows about this in this room.
110000	112000	You all are here at South by Southwest, so you probably know this,
112000	115000	but Web 1 was essentially a read-only version of the Internet.
115000	117000	In retrospect, people call this 90s version of the Web
117000	119000	the static Web.
119000	121000	It was like AOL, where you could browse Web pages
121000	123000	and read the news, but there was no easy way
123000	125000	for people to upload and share,
125000	127000	and then in the early 2000s,
127000	129000	a slew of new companies like YouTube and Facebook
129000	131000	and Twitter came onto the scene,
131000	134000	and YouTube's motto was broadcast yourself.
134000	136000	The whole idea of Web 2
136000	138000	was that for the first time as a creative person,
138000	140000	you could easily participate on the Internet.
140000	142000	You could post and tweet and upload
142000	144000	instead of just being a passenger,
144000	146000	and I thought that was fucking awesome.
146000	148000	Honestly, I still think it's fucking awesome.
148000	150000	It's so easy to forget how magical this is,
150000	152000	how special this is,
152000	154000	but this moment in history marked a shift
154000	157000	for humanity and for artists and creators especially,
157000	160000	because for the first time on the Internet,
160000	163000	you could do more than just consume.
163000	165000	You could create.
165000	167000	You could reach other people,
167000	169000	and it was in that moment,
169000	172000	right here in 2007, when I had to graduate college
172000	174000	and finish my record, Nightmares and Daydreams,
174000	176000	and I was trying to reach people with it,
176000	178000	and at the time, my best bet was DMing bands on Myspace
178000	180000	and asking if I could open for them
180000	182000	at local bars up and down the West Coast.
182000	184000	I sent cold outreach to music venues to get booked,
184000	187000	and then I got in my car because I couldn't afford to rent a van,
187000	189000	and I drove up and down the West Coast to the United States,
189000	191000	and I played the dankest local bars,
191000	193000	and I sang my guts out,
193000	195000	and I sweated, and I sang, and I sweated, and I sang,
195000	197000	and I ate tacos out of the back of my car
197000	199000	while my friends were all getting promoted
199000	201000	in high-paying jobs as investment bankers,
201000	203000	for years, tour after tour,
203000	205000	and I'm using the word tour lightly here.
205000	207000	Like, there weren't people at my shows.
207000	210000	Like, nobody came!
210000	212000	I had no fans!
212000	214000	On a good night, there were a couple stragglers
214000	216000	who wanted in off the street,
216000	218000	but I was playing empty bars.
218000	221000	It was so hard to reach people.
221000	223000	So you can imagine how excited I was
223000	226000	when a friend sent me a video of a guy named David Choi
226000	228000	singing with a guitar in front of his webcam
228000	231000	on a new website called YouTube.
231000	233000	And this video had, like, 300,000 views
233000	235000	or something like that.
235000	238000	I couldn't believe it! David was reaching people!
238000	240000	This phase of the internet had the potential
240000	244000	to solve a fundamental problem for me as an artist.
244000	247000	I felt like I had to jump in, and I did.
247000	249000	I immediately started uploading videos to YouTube.
249000	251000	Back then, no one else was showing
251000	254000	the, like, at-home recording process,
254000	256000	so I just filmed myself playing instruments,
256000	258000	and then I layered them in the video with split screens
258000	260000	so people could see all the musical elements
260000	262000	coming together to form a song.
262000	265000	And it's funny, because in 2023, this idea seems totally obvious,
265000	267000	but nobody was doing that back then.
267000	269000	It wasn't a fancy recording studio
269000	271000	with millions of dollars' equipment.
271000	273000	It was a bedroom with an M-Box audio interface
273000	275000	and a cheap version of a laptop recording software
275000	277000	called Pro Tools LE and an old Sony handicap
277000	279000	that I lugged around with me everywhere
279000	281000	that shot on high eight tapes
281000	283000	and a bed comforter humming on the wall
283000	285000	to dampen the sound and broken cymbals
285000	287000	but I was making real music.
287000	289000	I was screaming my fucking guts out
289000	291000	and playing accordion and doing collabs with friends
291000	293000	and it started working.
293000	296000	People started watching my videos and listening to my music.
296000	298000	I was reaching people.
298000	300000	My videos started getting thousands of views.
300000	302000	It wasn't millions of people at first,
302000	305000	but it was so much better than playing empty bars.
305000	308000	So I kept doing it.
308000	312000	And by 2009, I had made 43 YouTube videos of my songs
312000	314000	and I was feeling amazing
314000	316000	and the first time in my life,
316000	318000	I was actually reaching people with my work.
318000	321000	Okay, but the real beauty
321000	324000	of this new website called YouTube,
324000	327000	the most amazing thing about it,
327000	330000	was that it had a subscribe button.
330000	333000	I only realized how truly special
333000	335000	this idea was in retrospect.
335000	338000	But in my opinion, this concept turned out to be
338000	340000	one of the most important things
340000	342000	about this new era of the internet,
342000	344000	called Web 2.0.
344000	346000	The subscribe button was foundational.
346000	349000	It changed YouTube from being a tool to reach people,
349000	351000	to being a way to reach them
351000	354000	and then build a following around my work.
354000	357000	The subscribe button allowed people who liked my stuff
357000	360000	to sign up to see more of it in the future.
360000	363000	And as a creator, it gave me a channel of distribution
363000	367000	to ensure that my future work was sent to those people.
367000	371000	So it turned out that Web 2 solved more than just reach,
371000	373000	more than just discovery.
373000	375000	It represented the birth of the follower.
375000	379000	In my opinion, the follow is not some handy feature
379000	381000	of a social network.
381000	383000	The follow is foundational architecture
383000	386000	for human creativity and organization.
386000	389000	The idea of a creator, an artist, or a community of fans
389000	391000	around them who want to see their future work,
391000	394000	this concept, the follow, it's profound.
394000	397000	Whether it's the following that I was building as a musician
397000	399000	or a podcasting duo who talks about what it's like
399000	401000	to be single moms in a community of single mothers
401000	403000	who finally feel seen and understood
403000	405000	or a science education creator and students
405000	407000	who didn't previously have access to high quality education,
407000	410000	the follow was a system of organization
410000	412000	for the entire internet.
412000	415000	It was a framework for the distribution of creativity
415000	419000	and communication, not just reach,
419000	422000	but a step past it, ongoing communication,
422000	426000	connection, a sustained relationship, community.
426000	429000	And I learned just how magical the concept of the following could be
429000	432000	when I did my first collab with my girlfriend Natalie.
432000	435000	We put up a video on my YouTube channel in 2008
435000	437000	that was a song we created together,
437000	439000	and it was different than my music.
439000	441000	It was way less screamy and insane,
441000	444000	but it was more active and fleshed out than her music,
444000	447000	so we decided to create a new separate channel for our collabs
447000	450000	and we called this new YouTube channel, Pomplimus.
450000	453000	Oh, all right, got some Pomplimus fans in the house, all right.
454000	456000	But we posted our first video,
456000	459000	the first Pomplimus video was actually posted on my channel,
459000	461000	and I had about 7,000 subscribers at the time,
461000	463000	and my subscribers loved this new video.
463000	465000	And at the end of it, we posted a little link
465000	467000	to the new Pomplimus channel to tell people about it,
467000	470000	and almost instantly, the new Pomplimus channel
470000	472000	got 3,000 subscribers.
472000	474000	That's what a following is.
474000	476000	People see your new shit, literally they follow you,
476000	478000	wherever you go on the internet.
478000	480000	So Natalie and I started making more videos and more videos,
480000	482000	and within a year, we got 18,000 subscribers,
482000	485000	and then in one video, we announced that we were playing a show,
485000	487000	and we showed up to the show in San Francisco,
487000	490000	and there were 40 people there, and oh my God, guys,
490000	493000	I cannot tell you what it's like to have 40 people at your show
493000	495000	after years of playing empty bars.
495000	498000	Fucking magic. It was amazing.
500000	502000	It was so great.
503000	505000	That night was such a great night.
505000	507000	I feel like I literally can remember that.
507000	510000	Another time, Natalie and I were filming a vlog
510000	512000	to put in one of our videos,
512000	515000	and my sister happened to walk in behind us,
515000	517000	and she was holding a bar.
517000	519000	She's a soap maker.
519000	521000	She was holding a bar of grapefruit-scented soap.
521000	523000	Pomplimus means grapefruit in French.
523000	526000	And she said, hey, guys, look, I have Pomplimus soap.
526000	529000	And Natalie and I just saw that and decided to keep it in the video,
529000	531000	and we put it up in the video,
531000	533000	and our fans were like, oh my God, Pomplimus soap.
533000	535000	We want a bar of Pomplimus soap.
535000	537000	So we made another video, and we said, okay,
537000	539000	now you can order Pomplimus soap,
539000	541000	and we got hundreds of orders for Pomplimus soap.
541000	546000	Another time, when USB thumb drives were starting to get huge,
546000	548000	we thought, why do CDs?
548000	550000	Let's put all of our music on a thumb drive.
550000	552000	And so we did.
552000	554000	And we loaded up the thumb drives.
554000	556000	We put up a video. We said, hey, if you want to buy a thumb drive,
556000	558000	you can buy a thumb drive now.
558000	561000	And we ended up selling hundreds and hundreds of thumb drives.
561000	563000	We decided to sign every one of them,
563000	566000	and it was really personal with our fans.
566000	568000	And it was kind of crazy.
568000	570000	We had to figure out the packaging.
570000	572000	We had no idea how to package that many thumb drives.
572000	575000	My family ended up helping out.
575000	577000	My parents were freaking out.
577000	579000	Dad's taking pictures and stuff.
579000	581000	It was really fun. It was amazing.
581000	584000	Another time, we decided to put our album on iTunes,
584000	587000	our first Pomplimus album back in 2008,
587000	589000	and we didn't have artwork.
589000	592000	So we asked our fans, hey, do you want to make the artwork
592000	594000	for a Pomplimus?
594000	596000	And we got hundreds of submissions for the cover
596000	598000	of the new Pomplimus album from our fans.
598000	600000	And they were freaking talented.
600000	602000	Their artwork was amazing.
602000	604000	This is the one that actually won.
604000	606000	Natalie and I just love this one.
606000	608000	So this is the artwork for our first album.
608000	610000	It was made by one of our fans.
610000	613000	Another time, we booked a show at a laundromat.
613000	615000	That's a sentence I just said.
615000	617000	We booked a show at a laundromat.
617000	619000	The idea was like as a laundromat,
619000	621000	you could go order food, do your laundry,
621000	624000	eat by the time you're done eating, take your laundry home.
624000	626000	That was the idea of a laundromat.
626000	628000	And we booked the show.
628000	630000	If you crammed people in there,
630000	632000	it held 60 people in this laundromat.
632000	634000	And then we uploaded this video.
634000	636000	And this was the first video that we ever uploaded
636000	638000	that went viral.
638000	640000	And it got like half a million views overnight,
640000	642000	and we showed up to our show at the laundromat,
642000	645000	and there were 200 people crammed inside the laundromat.
645000	647000	And then 150 or 200 people outside,
648000	651000	like spilling in the street, cars were swerving around them.
651000	653000	And like there was no stage.
653000	654000	Like it's a laundromat.
654000	656000	So literally, I'm playing music, and there's a person.
656000	659000	Like I'm like looking out of person's eyes
659000	661000	while I'm playing pompomous songs.
661000	663000	It was insane.
663000	665000	Honestly, it was the first night.
665000	666000	It was mayhem.
666000	667000	I don't have any pictures of the night,
667000	668000	but this is what it felt like.
668000	669000	Like it was just like insane.
669000	671000	And this was the first time I was like,
671000	672000	oh my God, this is going to work.
672000	674000	Like having a following is amazing.
674000	675000	This is going to work.
675000	677000	We're going to be able to be full-time musicians.
677000	679000	Another time we posted another video.
679000	681000	And at the end of the video, we told our fans,
681000	683000	hey, we're uploading a song to iTunes.
683000	686000	We decided not to ever sign or kind of enter the music industry.
686000	687000	We did everything ourselves.
687000	690000	We negotiated our own contract with iTunes directly.
690000	692000	We posted our songs directly to iTunes.
692000	694000	And so we kept almost, you know,
694000	696000	all of the revenue associated with that.
696000	698000	And when we posted this album,
698000	700000	told our fans about it online, told our followers,
700000	703000	we sold 30,000 songs that month.
704000	709000	And we got $22,000 deposited directly into our bank account.
709000	711000	It was more money than I'd ever seen in one place,
711000	712000	ever in my life.
712000	713000	I was losing my mind.
713000	715000	It was so incredible.
715000	722000	Then Pompomoo started playing shows,
722000	723000	and we started touring.
723000	726000	And, you know, hundreds of people started showing up.
726000	727000	And then many hundreds of people,
727000	730000	and then thousands of people started showing up.
730000	732000	And this is my wife, Crowdsurfing,
732000	734000	because she's a fucking badass.
734000	741000	And that's what I mean when I say that the subscribe button
741000	745000	is not a silly feature.
745000	750000	The concept of the follow changed my life.
750000	754000	It made my dreams come true as an artist.
754000	756000	It took me from playing empty bars
756000	758000	to living out my fantasy as a musician.
758000	761000	The follow is a piece of internet architecture
761000	763000	that felt closer to magic than anything
763000	768000	I had ever experienced in my life.
768000	770000	Right around the moment that Pompomoo was starting to work,
770000	772000	right through all of this,
772000	775000	there is this genius named Kevin Kelly.
775000	777000	Has anybody heard of Kevin Kelly?
777000	779000	Founder of Wired, yeah, a bunch of people.
779000	782000	Okay, amazing thinker and mind.
782000	785000	He wrote an essay called A Thousand True Fans.
785000	787000	And his premise was simple.
787000	789000	It was that in the age of the internet,
789000	792000	you don't need millions of fans to be successful.
792000	794000	If you can just find a thousand people
794000	797000	who are willing to buy 100 bucks of stuff from you per year,
797000	800000	that's $100,000 per year,
800000	802000	which is a pretty freaking great business as a creative person.
802000	804000	You just need a thousand true fans
804000	807000	who really connect with you and believe in you.
807000	810000	And this is different than just reaching people.
810000	814000	It's even deeper than followers.
814000	817000	This is super fans, true fans, real fans.
817000	819000	Call it whatever you want.
819000	822000	The idea is that there's this group of people that is your core.
822000	825000	If reach means people see it,
825000	828000	and follower means people want to see more,
828000	831000	then true fans are the people who go to the shows
831000	833000	and buy the merch and download the record
833000	835000	and pay for the course and get the live stream tickets
835000	837000	and all the things.
837000	839000	And this idea really resonated with me.
839000	842000	We had fans showing up to Pompomoo shows
842000	846000	with tattoos of the band.
846000	850000	We had fans literally making custom t-shirts
850000	856000	of Pompomoo posters, drawings, artwork, cookies.
856000	859000	We had a fan do icing of my face on a cookie.
859000	862000	I ate my face.
862000	864000	We had a fan who made an oil painting
864000	866000	and me screaming my fucking guts out.
866000	871000	I learned HTML and I had a little website.
871000	874000	I used this link release software called eJunkie
874000	877000	and I cobbled together like a little MP3 store
877000	879000	for myself on the internet.
879000	882000	I would sell original music and I was selling 500 bucks a month
882000	884000	of my original songs on my own website
884000	888000	with my own shitty thing that I made.
888000	893000	Fans were showing up to buy things, to be there.
893000	897000	One time we asked our Pompomoo fans
897000	900000	to come film a music video with us on a Saturday,
900000	902000	like show up to Dolores Park in San Francisco,
902000	904000	show up and be in this music video.
904000	905000	50 people showed up.
905000	907000	They even learned this dance.
907000	909000	We shot this dance.
909000	911000	The dance is in this Pompomoo's video.
911000	915000	Another time we would actually always use this software
915000	918000	called Stage It, which is like a ticketed live stream software.
918000	920000	We could play our songs.
920000	923000	People could buy tickets and show up live on the internet.
923000	925000	Natalie and I would just sit at home
925000	927000	and play these songs for 45 minutes
927000	930000	and people would buy tickets and leave tips during the concert
930000	932000	and we would routinely make like three grand
932000	934000	in 45 minutes playing our songs.
934000	936000	It's like these are true fans.
936000	940000	Another time Natalie raised over $100,000
940000	943000	for her record from just 2,000 people.
943000	947000	Another time we made a Pompomoo's album
947000	949000	and we went online on YouTube.
949000	950000	We put up this video and we said,
950000	952000	hey, everybody, we have a new Pompomoo's album.
952000	953000	It's not for sale.
953000	954000	You can't buy it.
954000	956000	You can't get the new Pompomoo's album.
956000	958000	The only way to get the new Pompomoo's album
958000	961000	is if you donate a book to the Richmond School District
961000	965000	and then send us the receipt for that book
965000	967000	and we will send you the Pompomoo's album for free.
967000	968000	Just donate a book.
968000	969000	It's super easy.
969000	971000	We'll send you the album in the mail for free.
971000	973000	And the Richmond School District
973000	975000	ended up having to rent a shipping container
975000	977000	to keep up with the packages.
977000	980000	It's like 11,000 books that got sent to the Richmond School.
980000	983000	It's like $140,000 worth of books.
983000	985000	It was amazing.
985000	989000	It felt incredible to see that many people show up for this.
989000	994000	That's true fans, real fans, super fans.
994000	995000	Call it whatever you want.
995000	998000	But this was the concept that was rattling around in my head
998000	1000000	when I started Patreon 11 years ago.
1000000	1004000	This is actually the first sketch of Patreon.
1004000	1007000	I called up my co-founder and he turned this
1007000	1009000	into what is now Patreon.
1009000	1011000	And the idea was very simple.
1011000	1013000	It's like a membership platform
1013000	1015000	where fans could sign up for a subscription payment
1015000	1017000	to the creator and the creator could run a membership
1017000	1019000	and get paid for their work.
1019000	1021000	I'm not going to tell the Patreon founding story.
1021000	1022000	I've told it a million times.
1022000	1025000	But the company is now over 400 people, 11 years in.
1025000	1028000	We have over 250,000 creators
1028000	1031000	who have made over $3.5 billion on the platform,
1031000	1034000	which I think of as proof, if we ever needed it,
1034000	1039000	that the true fans are there and the true fans are ready.
1040000	1044000	Okay.
1044000	1047000	In the background, while Patreon was being formed,
1047000	1049000	building over the last decade,
1049000	1054000	the whole internet was again starting to shift.
1054000	1058000	And if you think of the 90s as Web 1 and the 2000s as Web 2,
1058000	1062000	right around the 2010s, there was a new change happening.
1062000	1066000	Facebook started experimenting with a new thing called ranking.
1066000	1068000	And I realize most everybody here knows about this.
1068000	1070000	Ranking did was essentially it took the feed,
1070000	1073000	which you can think of as a list of posts from creators that I follow,
1073000	1077000	and it analyzed each and every post for how engaging it was.
1077000	1079000	And if it wasn't engaging enough,
1079000	1084000	Facebook would then take that post and push it down in the feed.
1084000	1086000	In other words, they started ranking or ordering posts
1086000	1089000	according to what was best for their business.
1089000	1092000	This was actually great for Facebook.
1092000	1095000	It was the right business decision for them and their company
1095000	1097000	and their revenue model.
1097000	1102000	But what it meant for creators was that for the first time since Web 2.0,
1102000	1107000	my followers might not necessarily see my posts.
1107000	1110000	And this idea of a subscription started to break down.
1110000	1112000	If the person doesn't receive the things,
1112000	1116000	it's not really a direct true connection between a creator and their fans.
1116000	1118000	It's not really a subscription.
1118000	1121000	The channel of distribution is broken.
1121000	1123000	And it creates another problem too around creative freedom,
1123000	1127000	because now suddenly, my post has to be better than the other posts,
1127000	1131000	according to a set of criteria that I don't know or have control of
1131000	1133000	or even agree with.
1133000	1135000	So instead of thinking, what do I want to make?
1135000	1137000	What lights me up?
1137000	1140000	What is the output that I want to create as an artist?
1140000	1142000	What will my fans love?
1142000	1144000	Instead of thinking those questions, now in the back of my mind,
1144000	1147000	I'm thinking, what will the ranking algorithm favor?
1147000	1152000	And that subconsciously or consciously changes my creative output
1152000	1158000	to achieve Facebook's goals, not my goals as a creator.
1158000	1161000	And if it were just Facebook doing this, fine,
1161000	1164000	creators would just leave and post somewhere else.
1164000	1167000	But it worked really well.
1167000	1169000	It was great for Facebook's business.
1169000	1172000	And people started spending even more time on the platform.
1172000	1174000	So the other platforms had to compete.
1174000	1176000	And YouTube launched the Cosmic Panda redesign,
1176000	1179000	centering the entire company around watch time.
1179000	1182000	And Twitter and Instagram followed with ranked feeds in 2016.
1182000	1184000	And we only saw it in retrospect.
1184000	1188000	But now I think of the 2010s as the decade of ranking,
1188000	1192000	the decade when the original promise of the creator-led community,
1192000	1197000	the true follow was broken for the first time.
1197000	1199000	I want to just do a quick aside here,
1199000	1202000	because I know there's this big debate in the world
1202000	1205000	about chronological feeds versus algorithmic feeds.
1205000	1208000	And I don't want to make it sound like I'm a zealot
1208000	1210000	on either of the two polarized sides.
1210000	1212000	It's actually not the takeaway here.
1212000	1213000	It's not how I think of it.
1213000	1215000	I actually see problems with chronological feeds,
1215000	1217000	because as a creator, if it's chronological,
1217000	1219000	then you have to keep posting to stay on top.
1219000	1221000	So I don't think that's necessarily the best way
1221000	1223000	to build strong relationships either.
1223000	1227000	The problem that I have is if you're going to change that,
1227000	1230000	if you're going to adjust the way you create a feed,
1230000	1232000	what is the purpose behind that?
1232000	1234000	What is the intention behind that?
1234000	1237000	Are you trying to create a place
1237000	1239000	where you can build strength of relationship
1239000	1240000	with your community,
1240000	1242000	where your fandom gets energized over time,
1242000	1245000	where people are guaranteed that subscription,
1245000	1247000	where you get a direct connection with your community
1247000	1248000	and your true fans?
1248000	1249000	Is that it?
1249000	1251000	Or is it maximizing attention?
1251000	1253000	Is it maximizing watch time?
1253000	1255000	Those are two very different goals
1255000	1257000	and very different ways of organizing
1257000	1260000	your entire product as a technology company.
1260000	1263000	This one helps me as a creator,
1263000	1266000	and this one hurts me as a creator.
1266000	1267000	It hurts my community.
1267000	1268000	It hurts my business.
1268000	1270000	It hurts my creative output.
1274000	1278000	I wish that it stopped there,
1278000	1280000	but around the turn of the decade,
1280000	1283000	a new company came onto the scene called TikTok,
1283000	1285000	and TikTok had a much deeper impact on the ecosystem
1285000	1287000	I think anyone foresaw at the time.
1287000	1289000	It wasn't just short form vertical first video.
1289000	1290000	That wasn't it.
1290000	1291000	That's a red herring, I think.
1291000	1293000	It was much more fundamental than that.
1293000	1294000	TikTok said,
1294000	1297000	we want to make the most engaging feed possible.
1297000	1300000	This whole idea of a list of your subscriptions,
1300000	1301000	forget about that.
1301000	1304000	In fact, forget about the whole concept of subscriptions.
1304000	1306000	TikTok started from the ground up
1306000	1309000	with something totally different called For You,
1309000	1312000	where each of these posts are chosen for me by TikTok
1312000	1315000	instead of me choosing what's in my feed,
1315000	1320000	and this completely abandoned the concept of the follow.
1320000	1321000	But it worked.
1322000	1324000	TikTok had a billion users by 2021,
1324000	1326000	and traffic on the internet started flowing away
1326000	1329000	from the legacy social companies and toward TikTok.
1329000	1331000	So just like with Facebook and ranking,
1331000	1333000	the other platforms had to compete.
1333000	1335000	YouTube launched shorts,
1335000	1337000	Instagram launched reels,
1337000	1339000	and Twitter launched a For You feed as well,
1339000	1341000	and within a couple of years,
1341000	1344000	this whole system of organization for the internet,
1344000	1346000	the creator-led community,
1346000	1348000	started to fade into the past.
1349000	1354000	I have really felt this personally as a creator
1354000	1356000	in the last four years, especially.
1356000	1359000	My fans don't see as much of my stuff anymore.
1359000	1361000	It's harder to sell tickets to a show.
1361000	1363000	It's harder to reach people with my new work.
1363000	1364000	It's harder to build community.
1364000	1366000	It's harder to build a business.
1366000	1368000	It's harder to energize my fans.
1368000	1370000	I was curious for the creators and the audience.
1370000	1372000	Are you feeling this too?
1372000	1373000	Are folks in the room feeling this?
1373000	1375000	I'm seeing nodding heads, raised hands.
1375000	1376000	Yes, okay.
1377000	1379000	This is, I just feel it.
1381000	1386000	What's happening here is we are in the middle of another shift,
1386000	1388000	and this is a big one.
1388000	1390000	If the 90s was Web 1,
1390000	1392000	and the 2000s was Web 2,
1392000	1394000	and the 2010s was ranking,
1394000	1396000	I'm worried that the 2020s
1396000	1398000	could become the death of the follower.
1402000	1405000	I got an email from a creator
1405000	1407000	that I was spending a lot of time with
1407000	1410000	a little while ago, about a year and a half ago,
1410000	1412000	and I got this email in my heart,
1412000	1414000	just sank in my stomach.
1414000	1416000	Can we get the slide up? Great.
1418000	1420000	Hey, Jack.
1420000	1422000	I'm writing this letter to you hat in hand
1422000	1423000	due to changes at Facebook.
1423000	1425000	Overnight, the traffic to my links in my page
1425000	1426000	is dropped by 80%.
1426000	1428000	As such, it looks like I'll have to sell my home.
1428000	1430000	I'm dusting off my resume
1430000	1432000	and looking for jobs in social media management.
1433000	1437000	This is now,
1437000	1440000	I'm seeing more and more of things like this,
1440000	1442000	and it's not just happening to creators.
1442000	1445000	It's happening to anyone who posts stuff on the internet.
1445000	1447000	It's happening to media companies.
1447000	1450000	Look at what's happening to Vice and Buzzfeed
1450000	1453000	and Rooster Teeth's announcement a couple of weeks ago.
1453000	1456000	This is a really hard change to navigate
1456000	1459000	for anyone who's posting stuff online
1459000	1461000	and trying to build community and business.
1462000	1464000	For the creators in the room,
1464000	1466000	I think it's really important to remember that
1466000	1468000	and to understand that.
1468000	1471000	If you're not connecting
1471000	1474000	as much as you want to with your audience right now,
1474000	1476000	that does not necessarily mean
1476000	1478000	there's something wrong with you.
1478000	1480000	A lot of us as creators have this tendency to be like,
1480000	1481000	what can I do better?
1481000	1483000	And that's a good impulse, honestly.
1483000	1484000	It's like growth mindset.
1484000	1486000	How am I contributing to this?
1486000	1487000	What can I do better?
1487000	1490000	And again, I think most of the time that's really good,
1490000	1493000	but there is also something happening in the background right now.
1493000	1496000	It's a macro thing that's happening on the web
1496000	1500000	that makes our jobs as creators really hard right now.
1500000	1503000	There's a lot of smart people at big companies
1503000	1505000	that are well-funded, big media companies,
1505000	1507000	trying to figure this out too,
1507000	1509000	and they're having trouble with it too.
1509000	1511000	So as creators, just know that.
1511000	1514000	It doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong with you here.
1515000	1520000	I believe that this problem is the single most important problem
1520000	1522000	that faces creative people today.
1522000	1524000	The weakening of creator-led communities,
1524000	1526000	of our distribution channels to our fans.
1526000	1528000	This is the hardest, most challenging,
1528000	1530000	and most painful issue threatening the present
1530000	1533000	and the future of creativity on the internet.
1533000	1536000	So I want to be very clear about this.
1536000	1541000	I actually, I don't think that this is going to happen.
1541000	1545000	I don't think that we're actually going to see the real death of the follower.
1545000	1547000	That's not what I think is going to happen.
1547000	1550000	I think the follow is too important to die.
1550000	1552000	I think it's too valuable to ignore.
1552000	1556000	I think it's too useful and awesome for creative people,
1556000	1558000	for publishers, for media companies,
1558000	1560000	and I think the next wave of internet
1560000	1563000	and media technology companies are going to surge on this problem
1563000	1565000	and try to solve it.
1565000	1567000	And it's actually already started.
1567000	1569000	And the incumbents of the audience
1569000	1571000	are not going to be able to fight it
1571000	1574000	because their revenue relies on maximizing attention.
1574000	1577000	To drive their businesses, they're being forced up
1577000	1581000	towards discovery, towards reach, personalization, algorithmic curation.
1581000	1583000	These are the levers that drive attention
1583000	1586000	and therefore they drive their strategies.
1586000	1588000	That's why there's a whole already opening up
1588000	1591000	and why we're starting to see a whole new set of companies emerge
1591000	1594000	that look fundamentally different from the legacy social landscape.
1594000	1597000	Discord and Kajabi and Fourth Wall and Gumroad Moment,
1597000	1599000	which Patreon acquired last year.
1599000	1601000	The Courses Platforms, Events Companies.
1601000	1605000	Some people are calling this subset of companies the creator economy.
1605000	1607000	I don't even think of it like that.
1607000	1610000	It's a fundamental shift in approach.
1610000	1613000	And the hallmark strategy of the drivers of these businesses
1613000	1616000	is the focus on deeper connections,
1616000	1618000	as opposed to just more connections.
1618000	1621000	The true fan, the real fan, call it whatever you want.
1621000	1625000	It's the 5% of fans that drive 90% of the community and business.
1625000	1627000	This is a direct to fan business.
1627000	1629000	This is an ads business.
1629000	1631000	This is about depth of connection.
1631000	1633000	This is about maximizing attention.
1633000	1635000	This is about deeper fans.
1635000	1637000	This is about more fans.
1637000	1639000	And what binds this new wave of emerging companies
1639000	1643000	is that their strategic focus is down here.
1643000	1646000	The next decade of creative and media technology companies
1646000	1649000	will focus on building direct to fan connections
1649000	1652000	and community strength.
1652000	1655000	As creators, we'll still need the social platforms.
1655000	1658000	We'll still need those companies up here for discovery, for reach.
1658000	1660000	We need that.
1660000	1662000	But those companies will be one component
1662000	1665000	of the many tools that we have as creative people
1665000	1668000	to help us run our communities and businesses.
1668000	1670000	That's where the world is going.
1670000	1673000	I'm sure of it.
1673000	1677000	And personally, right now,
1677000	1682000	I feel a sense of responsibility through this.
1682000	1685000	I feel a sense of responsibility because
1685000	1689000	I remember what it feels like to be a creator
1689000	1691000	on the outside of these platforms,
1691000	1694000	watching the internet move in a direction
1694000	1696000	that I don't agree with and that I don't like
1696000	1699000	and that I don't think is good for my community and my business.
1699000	1701000	I remember what that feels like.
1701000	1703000	I remember feeling anxiety.
1703000	1705000	I remember feeling fear.
1705000	1707000	I remember feeling scared of where that was going
1707000	1710000	and what it meant for me.
1710000	1714000	And now, through whatever crazy life path
1714000	1717000	I have been on as an artist,
1717000	1720000	I'm now finding myself as a CEO
1720000	1723000	of one of these fucking tech companies
1723000	1727000	and I feel this sense of
1727000	1730000	I want to help build the type of internet
1730000	1733000	that I want as a creator.
1733000	1737000	That's what I want to do.
1737000	1740000	So I really don't want this talk to feel like a Patreon ad.
1740000	1742000	Actually, I really hope it doesn't.
1742000	1745000	But I do want to give you a sense
1745000	1747000	of how I'm thinking about this problem
1747000	1749000	given this seat that I'm in
1749000	1752000	and how Patreon is now thinking about this problem
1752000	1754000	and what we think our place is in it
1754000	1758000	and what we want to do about it.
1758000	1761000	And the headline is this.
1761000	1764000	It's been 20 or 30 years.
1764000	1770000	And the current version of how art and community
1770000	1773000	exists on the internet today,
1773000	1777000	I don't think is the right version.
1777000	1780000	How community and art exists on the web.
1780000	1782000	I don't think it's the right way.
1782000	1785000	And I want Patreon to contribute
1785000	1787000	to building a better version
1787000	1790000	of how art and community could exist on the internet.
1790000	1793000	We've oriented the whole company
1793000	1798000	around this problem.
1798000	1800000	And we've been building a lot in the background
1800000	1801000	over the last couple of years,
1801000	1803000	but we made some big announcements a couple of months ago
1803000	1805000	about the next phase of Patreon
1805000	1808000	and how we're thinking about this problem.
1808000	1811000	Specifically, we started as a membership platform
1811000	1813000	11 years ago, subscription payments.
1813000	1815000	But we have built a lot,
1815000	1817000	especially in the last three years,
1817000	1819000	in an effort to take a more holistic approach
1819000	1821000	to building this.
1821000	1823000	We built video, community, podcasting,
1823000	1825000	better posting, a new media player, commerce,
1825000	1827000	free membership, which is essentially like a follow
1827000	1830000	gated on an email and live.
1830000	1832000	And while this might look like a lot,
1832000	1834000	it's actually just three things,
1834000	1837000	media, community, and business.
1837000	1839000	And we're now thinking of Patreon
1839000	1841000	no longer as a membership platform,
1841000	1843000	where we started,
1843000	1845000	but as this whole thing,
1845000	1847000	the media, community, and business foundation
1847000	1849000	for the next decade of professional creativity
1849000	1851000	on the internet,
1851000	1854000	organized around the concept of the true follow
1854000	1856000	in an effort to build a better way
1856000	1859000	that art can exist on the web.
1859000	1861000	That's the theory.
1861000	1864000	That's what the company is setting out to solve now.
1864000	1867000	And in practice, what that looks like
1867000	1869000	is a new set of products and tools
1869000	1871000	that we built into Patreon.
1871000	1874000	This is our first foray into community.
1874000	1876000	And essentially this allows fans
1876000	1878000	to connect with each other
1878000	1880000	and build energized fandoms
1880000	1882000	and creators to hop in there and talk with fans.
1882000	1884000	It's a place for true fandom.
1884000	1886000	Why do we build this?
1886000	1888000	What's the thinking? What's the strategy
1888000	1890000	and the idea behind this? Here's why.
1890000	1892000	As a creator on the internet today,
1892000	1894000	I can get subscribers and I can get views
1894000	1896000	and if I can send my fans to Instagram
1896000	1898000	or TikTok and they can be there,
1898000	1900000	but what I've noticed is those communities
1900000	1902000	degrade over time.
1902000	1904000	They don't get energized over time.
1904000	1906000	They get de-energized.
1906000	1908000	It gets harder and harder to reach those people.
1908000	1910000	I make a post. I reach 2% of my audience.
1910000	1912000	I reach 1% of my audience.
1912000	1914000	I lose touch with those people
1914000	1916000	and there's no way for me to find
1916000	1918000	those real fans, those true fans,
1918000	1920000	the small portion of my fans
1920000	1922000	that drive everything for me as a creator.
1922000	1924000	The way we're building this
1924000	1926000	and what I want as a creator
1926000	1928000	is a place where I can send my fans
1928000	1930000	and that fandom gets energy over time.
1930000	1932000	That fandom gets closer.
1932000	1934000	That fandom gets more vibrant,
1934000	1936000	more connected over time,
1936000	1938000	more enthusiastic over time.
1938000	1940000	That's what I want as a creator.
1940000	1942000	That's the space that I want to have
1942000	1944000	as a creative person.
1944000	1946000	Creators deserve a place like that.
1946000	1948000	That is important.
1948000	1950000	It's important for the future of creativity.
1950000	1952000	Another thing that we built
1952000	1954000	is commerce.
1954000	1956000	Commerce allows creators
1956000	1958000	to sell a digital thing,
1958000	1960000	anything that you can sell online,
1960000	1962000	any digital thing.
1962000	1964000	Why did we build this? Why did we build commerce?
1964000	1966000	Because
1966000	1968000	creators
1968000	1970000	send lots of people to their Patreon,
1970000	1972000	millions of people to their Patreon pages every month.
1972000	1974000	What we found is
1974000	1976000	a lot of those people are true fans.
1976000	1978000	They're like the really intense,
1978000	1980000	interested, excited fans.
1980000	1982000	But not all of those fans
1982000	1984000	are ready to pay with a subscription payment.
1984000	1986000	In fact, a lot of them don't want to pay
1986000	1988000	with a subscription payment.
1988000	1990000	A lot of them.
1990000	1992000	Why? Why don't they want to pay with a subscription payment?
1992000	1994000	Either they have subscription fatigue,
1994000	1996000	which is a real thing,
1996000	1998000	or they're not in the right financial situation,
1998000	2000000	or they don't want to commit to a payment every month.
2000000	2002000	But they're still true fans.
2002000	2004000	Rather than having those true fans
2004000	2006000	leave the creator,
2006000	2008000	we want to give creators a way
2008000	2010000	to start forming connections with those fans,
2010000	2012000	to build businesses with those fans.
2012000	2014000	We built commerce as a way
2014000	2016000	to participate in the creator's business
2016000	2018000	and community through this commerce product.
2018000	2020000	Meanwhile, the creator can build
2020000	2022000	an awesome business along the way, too.
2022000	2024000	The logic is very similar for free membership.
2024000	2026000	Why do we build free membership?
2026000	2028000	What is free membership, by the way?
2028000	2030000	Think of this as a follow gated on your email.
2030000	2032000	It's kind of like an email capture,
2032000	2034000	almost, as a creator.
2034000	2036000	It allows a fan to follow your page
2036000	2038000	without paying
2038000	2040000	in exchange for giving them your email.
2040000	2042000	It's the same logic as commerce.
2042000	2044000	They're sending their true fans millions
2044000	2046000	every month to their Patreon pages.
2046000	2048000	And we wanted to give creators a way
2048000	2050000	to reach that portion of their fans
2050000	2052000	that they go to the shows,
2052000	2054000	they have the merch, they have the hat.
2054000	2056000	They're true fans, but for whatever reason,
2056000	2058000	they don't want to buy one of the things you have digitally,
2058000	2060000	and they don't want to pay a subscription.
2060000	2062000	And this allows creators
2062000	2064000	to continue forming relationships with those fans.
2064000	2066000	And what's super exciting about this
2066000	2068000	is we have found that about 40 to 50%
2068000	2070000	of these fans
2070000	2072000	actually say
2072000	2074000	that they intend to pay the creator
2074000	2076000	in the next few months.
2076000	2078000	They have high intention
2078000	2080000	to be a part of the creators' community and business.
2080000	2082000	And this gives creators a way
2082000	2084000	to start building community with those folks.
2084000	2086000	Okay, we also
2086000	2088000	acquired a live experiences
2088000	2090000	platform called Moment.
2090000	2092000	And I don't even
2092000	2094000	want to call it ticketed live streaming,
2094000	2096000	because it's so much more beautiful than that.
2096000	2098000	Arjun and the team did such an incredible job
2098000	2100000	of building this place
2100000	2102000	for creators to sell tickets
2102000	2104000	to these live experiences,
2104000	2106000	and they can debut their work.
2106000	2108000	A stand-up special, a movie that they've made,
2108000	2110000	a special episode
2110000	2112000	that they know is going to be a total banger,
2112000	2114000	whatever it is, it allows creators
2114000	2116000	to sell tickets to that experience
2116000	2118000	and then have community with those fans
2118000	2120000	while they're all watching it together.
2120000	2122000	And they've launched amazing creators,
2122000	2124000	Tam and Paula and Bieber,
2124000	2126000	and they've worked with folks like Arjun Schultz,
2126000	2128000	to have that live community experience
2128000	2130000	and start gathering those community members
2130000	2132000	around their work.
2132000	2134000	Okay, so
2134000	2136000	all that to say,
2136000	2138000	the way we're thinking about it,
2138000	2140000	and the way we're thinking about this next phase is that
2140000	2142000	we're not just a membership company anymore.
2142000	2144000	We're a true fan company.
2144000	2146000	We're a creator company.
2146000	2148000	We're building a better way for art and community
2148000	2150000	to exist on the internet.
2150000	2152000	Because I want Patreon to build
2152000	2154000	an internet where creators have
2154000	2156000	true creative freedom.
2156000	2158000	I want Patreon to contribute to a web
2158000	2160000	where creators have control of their businesses
2160000	2162000	and their careers.
2162000	2164000	And I want it to feel like fire
2164000	2166000	to be part of a creator's community.
2166000	2168000	I know what it feels like
2168000	2170000	to be part of an energized community.
2170000	2172000	I remember it.
2172000	2174000	And I have that same conviction now
2174000	2176000	that I did back in 2013 when I started Patreon.
2176000	2178000	I know that it is possible
2178000	2180000	to build an internet where fandoms thrive
2180000	2182000	and where professional creativity is possible
2182000	2184000	for anyone.
2184000	2186000	I believe this in my bones.
2186000	2188000	It is not a choice.
2188000	2190000	It's not optimism.
2190000	2192000	It's just deep down what I actually know
2192000	2194000	to be available to humanity
2194000	2196000	if that is the path that we choose.
2200000	2202000	Okay.
2202000	2204000	That's what Patreon is doing.
2204000	2206000	It's how we're thinking about this future
2206000	2208000	and Patreon's place in it.
2208000	2210000	But for the creators in the audience,
2210000	2212000	creators don't have to wait.
2212000	2214000	Creators don't have to wait for this.
2214000	2216000	Over the last decade,
2216000	2218000	I've talked to thousands of creative people.
2218000	2220000	I've had my own creative projects.
2220000	2222000	I've learned a lot.
2222000	2224000	And I want to share just a few thoughts
2224000	2226000	about navigating the shifts
2226000	2228000	in the internet
2228000	2230000	and how we can all
2230000	2232000	prepare ourselves
2232000	2234000	and our communities for those shifts.
2234000	2236000	And we don't even need to wait
2236000	2238000	for any of the tech platforms
2238000	2240000	to catch up.
2240000	2242000	Can I get next slide?
2242000	2244000	Great.
2244000	2246000	The first,
2246000	2248000	invest in those true fans.
2248000	2250000	Invest in the depth of connection.
2250000	2252000	Not just new.
2252000	2254000	It's not all about new views,
2254000	2256000	new subscribers, watch time up and to the right.
2256000	2258000	It's about depth.
2258000	2260000	It's about quality of interaction.
2260000	2262000	It's about finding that small portion of your fans
2262000	2264000	that are your engine,
2264000	2266000	that are your core,
2266000	2268000	that are your core.
2268000	2270000	And that's what I'm trying to reach them.
2270000	2272000	Sometimes when I talk about this,
2272000	2274000	creators think,
2274000	2276000	does that mean like DMs?
2276000	2278000	Should I be talking to individual fans?
2278000	2280000	No, not necessarily.
2280000	2282000	That's not actually what I mean.
2282000	2284000	Finding those people
2284000	2286000	and building real connections with them
2286000	2288000	in whatever capacity you have.
2288000	2290000	And my team will probably kill me for saying this.
2290000	2292000	It's not even using Patreon.
2292000	2294000	There's a bunch of ways that you can do this.
2294000	2296000	I'm a little biased, but I think you could.
2296000	2298000	You could find
2298000	2300000	some other place
2300000	2302000	where you can build that community
2302000	2304000	with your true fans.
2304000	2306000	The point is find those people
2306000	2308000	and invest in that community.
2308000	2310000	That is the engine that will drive your business,
2310000	2312000	slingshot your business
2312000	2314000	through these shifts in the internet.
2314000	2316000	Okay.
2316000	2318000	The second thing,
2318000	2320000	make beautiful things.
2320000	2322000	There is so much tension,
2322000	2324000	especially right now,
2324000	2326000	to make for the algorithm.
2328000	2330000	And I've seen the diagrams.
2330000	2332000	I've seen the charts.
2332000	2334000	I've even drawn them in my history.
2334000	2336000	Make for the algorithm, make for yourself,
2336000	2338000	and then make the things that help you build a business.
2338000	2340000	This is a Venn diagram, little center part,
2340000	2342000	and that's the sweet part. I've seen all that.
2342000	2344000	And I get that.
2344000	2346000	But the gravity,
2346000	2348000	the gravity,
2348000	2350000	everywhere we look as creators today,
2350000	2352000	the gravity is just pushing us.
2352000	2354000	It's just pushing us toward
2354000	2356000	making for other reasons
2356000	2358000	than why we set out to make things in the first place.
2360000	2362000	It's so important
2362000	2364000	to remember to make beautiful things,
2364000	2366000	to make things that light you up,
2366000	2368000	and to make things that you care about.
2368000	2370000	There's a wonderful metaphor that I love.
2372000	2374000	It's a business metaphor,
2374000	2376000	but it makes sense for creators too, I think.
2376000	2378000	It's a metaphor of the business
2378000	2380000	of the hot dog stand under the Eiffel Tower,
2380000	2382000	or the local restaurant.
2382000	2384000	And the hot dog stand in the Eiffel Tower
2384000	2386000	gets thousands of new customers
2386000	2388000	coming through their hot dog stand every day.
2388000	2390000	It's just tourists just coming through.
2390000	2392000	And they know they're going to get lots and lots of new customers,
2392000	2394000	and none of those people come back, but it doesn't matter,
2394000	2396000	because they're just always getting new customers every day
2396000	2398000	because of the Eiffel Tower,
2398000	2400000	and they just make hot dogs and sell them,
2400000	2402000	and some portion of those customers buy their hot dogs.
2402000	2404000	Actually, you don't even have to be very good hot dogs.
2404000	2406000	They just sell hot dogs. They know they're going to keep making money.
2406000	2408000	And that business works.
2408000	2410000	Like, it works. It's an okay business.
2410000	2412000	There's another business, which is the local restaurant business,
2414000	2416000	where the people there just focus on making
2416000	2418000	great food and having great service.
2420000	2422000	And they actually are not in a place that gets a lot of foot traffic,
2422000	2424000	so they don't get lots of new customers,
2424000	2426000	but everybody in like a five-mile radius
2426000	2428000	eats there twice a month.
2428000	2430000	And they just get lots of repeat customers
2430000	2432000	because they've built trust,
2432000	2434000	and they've built depth of connection with those people,
2434000	2436000	and people know that restaurant
2436000	2438000	and love it and know they're going to have a great time
2438000	2440000	when they're there.
2440000	2442000	That is a great business.
2442000	2444000	You don't have to get lots of new
2444000	2446000	and billions and acquisition,
2446000	2448000	and you don't...
2448000	2450000	That's not the only type of business you can build as a creator.
2450000	2452000	There's this wonderful group of creators
2452000	2454000	who are like, God, I've fallen in love with them.
2454000	2456000	Anybody heard of the YouTube New Wave?
2456000	2458000	Has anybody heard of these folks seeing some hands?
2458000	2460000	It's this group of creators.
2460000	2463000	They make these wonderful 30, 45-minute long form
2464000	2467000	films, many documentaries
2467000	2469000	about their lives and their struggles
2469000	2472000	coming into the world and quitting college,
2472000	2474000	and they're beautiful. It's incredible.
2474000	2476000	They're patient, they're slow,
2476000	2478000	the films are long,
2478000	2480000	but, oh, my God,
2480000	2482000	the depth of the message
2482000	2484000	in these films is incredible,
2484000	2486000	and they're building such a strong community
2486000	2488000	around their work.
2488000	2491000	People just love what they have to say
2491000	2493000	and wait to see the next one.
2493000	2495000	That's a real business.
2495000	2497000	That's a real community.
2497000	2499000	It's different than what we're incentivized to do
2499000	2501000	everywhere on the Internet,
2501000	2503000	but that works.
2503000	2505000	Okay.
2505000	2507000	The last thing.
2509000	2511000	Ooh, that was loud.
2513000	2515000	Know what you want.
2517000	2519000	The hardest lesson I have learned
2519000	2521000	as a creative person
2521000	2523000	and as an operator and CEO
2523000	2525000	over the last 10 years
2525000	2527000	is to know
2527000	2529000	and trust what I want
2531000	2533000	and to be true to that over time.
2533000	2536000	That's easier said than done.
2538000	2540000	Don't let somebody else
2540000	2542000	tell you what you want,
2543000	2545000	because then you'll end up with what they want
2545000	2547000	instead of what you want.
2547000	2549000	I think a good example of that
2549000	2551000	is as creators,
2551000	2553000	we open up our dashboards
2553000	2555000	and we see
2555000	2557000	these metrics on what success is.
2557000	2559000	This is a dashboard that someone else
2559000	2561000	built for us,
2561000	2563000	and it tells us what we want,
2563000	2565000	and the weird thing is after a couple of years,
2565000	2567000	we start to believe that.
2567000	2569000	Our minds get reprogrammed
2569000	2571000	and we believe this is what I want.
2571000	2573000	This is success,
2573000	2575000	and we chase that.
2578000	2580000	If you went back in time
2580000	2582000	and you asked Ella Fitzgerald
2582000	2584000	or David Bowie or Prince,
2584000	2586000	what do you want?
2586000	2588000	What's your goal as an artist?
2588000	2590000	What matters to you?
2590000	2592000	Do you think Bowie would have said,
2593000	2595000	my goal as an artist
2595000	2597000	is to maximize
2597000	2599000	the amount of human hours
2599000	2601000	spent consuming my work?
2601000	2603000	I don't know
2603000	2605000	what Bowie wanted.
2605000	2607000	I'm not going to pretend to,
2607000	2609000	but I can tell you what I want as an artist.
2609000	2611000	I can tell you what matters to me
2611000	2613000	as a creative person,
2613000	2615000	and what I know will matter to me
2615000	2617000	10 years ago, now,
2617000	2619000	and 10 years from now.
2619000	2621000	I want to say something
2621000	2623000	that matters to somebody.
2623000	2626000	I want to say something that only I can say
2626000	2628000	because of whatever experience
2628000	2630000	I've had in my lived experience
2631000	2633000	something that is uniquely
2634000	2636000	pointed to me.
2636000	2638000	I want to say that.
2638000	2640000	I want to figure out how to say that.
2640000	2642000	I want to find that core of human truth
2642000	2644000	in my experience
2644000	2646000	and communicate it eloquently and clearly
2646000	2648000	and have it be true and feel true
2648000	2650000	and have someone else see that
2650000	2652000	and have that person think,
2652000	2654000	yes, that feels true
2654000	2656000	and it feels true to them.
2656000	2658000	And I want that person to feel connected to me
2658000	2660000	that I've never met before in our lives.
2660000	2662000	But I said a thing that resonated with them
2662000	2664000	and made them feel a little bit less alone
2664000	2666000	because they felt like there was another person
2666000	2668000	who had that same experience.
2668000	2670000	I want to make things that are timeless.
2670000	2672000	I want to make things that feel true now.
2672000	2674000	I want to make things that feel true in 50 years.
2674000	2676000	I want to make things that still feel true
2676000	2678000	500 years after I'm dead.
2680000	2682000	I want to figure out how to use my
2682000	2684000	short years on this planet
2684000	2686000	to find that kind of truth and say it.
2686000	2688000	That's what I want
2688000	2690000	as an artist.
2690000	2692000	And that's a very different goal
2692000	2694000	than watch time.
2696000	2698000	That may not be what you want
2698000	2700000	as an artist and that's okay.
2700000	2702000	But the point is to know
2702000	2704000	what you want,
2704000	2706000	what matters to you,
2706000	2708000	what are you trying to achieve
2708000	2710000	as a creative person.
2712000	2714000	We have this tendency to look outside
2714000	2716000	for those answers.
2716000	2718000	I do it too.
2718000	2720000	This advice is honestly more for me
2720000	2722000	than it is for anybody else in this room.
2722000	2724000	We want there to be a Yoda.
2724000	2726000	We want there to be a leader
2726000	2728000	or a manager or a voice of authority
2728000	2730000	that can tell us what we want
2730000	2732000	because it's a scary thing to ask.
2732000	2734000	But that does not exist.
2734000	2736000	What we want comes
2736000	2738000	intrinsically, not extrinsically.
2738000	2740000	It comes from in here.
2740000	2742000	That's where we find it.
2744000	2746000	So as we navigate
2746000	2748000	this next phase of the internet
2748000	2750000	as creative people,
2750000	2752000	as we go through these ups and downs
2752000	2754000	of the web
2754000	2756000	in its ever-evolving state,
2756000	2758000	do not forget
2758000	2760000	what matters to you as an artist.
2760000	2762000	Do not forget what fills you
2762000	2764000	with pride to make.
2764000	2766000	Do not forget
2766000	2768000	your purpose for making things
2768000	2770000	in the first place.
2770000	2772000	Don't forget why you wake up in the morning
2772000	2774000	and energy to your craft.
2776000	2778000	Don't forget what gives you
2778000	2780000	a sense of meaning
2780000	2782000	as a creative person.
2782000	2784000	And lastly,
2784000	2786000	don't forget to scream your fucking guts out.
2786000	2788000	Thank you, everybody. Appreciate you being here.
2788000	2790000	Thank you.
2790000	2792000	Thanks.
2792000	2794000	Thank you.
2794000	2796000	Thanks.
2796000	2798000	Thank you.
2802000	2804000	Thank you.
