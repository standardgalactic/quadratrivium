1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Hi, everybody. Hello, hello.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Welcome. I'm so psyched to be here today.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Maybe before I even get started,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
can I just get a show of hands?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If you're a creator, raise your hand.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let's see, creators. Oh, my gosh. Yes.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay. If you're in the music industry,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
folks in the music industry, management companies, labels,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
okay, great. Cool.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And then how about if you're just in tech,

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
like anybody in tech, creator, economy, tech?

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay, awesome. Cool. All right.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So, I have a little cool mix of folks here today.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I've been thinking a lot about the whole arc of the Internet

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and how it's evolved over the last couple of decades,

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and then how I think it's going to evolve,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and Patreon's place in all of that.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And that's what I want to share with you today.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So, I started making music and videos

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
and putting them on the Internet right after I finished college

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
in 2007, and I made a ton of movies in school.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I also made animations as a kid,

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
so making stuff wasn't particularly new to me,

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but I had just spent, at the time,

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
when I finished college, six months and thousands of hours

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
on a new record called Nightmares and Daydreams.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I was living at my dad's house at the time,

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
working out in my old childhood bedroom,

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and I was trying to figure out how to reach people

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
with this new record that I had worked so hard on.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Like, even the cover, that guy on the cover

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
is an actual clay guy that I made out of Sculpey,

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and then I did a photo shoot with him,

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and I did a great job, but then I had to use the lasso tool

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and Photoshop to cut him out,

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and this was before the magnetic lasso tool,

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
so I had to do that shit by hand,

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and that took way too long, but none of that mattered,

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
because by sheer luck, I happened to finish school

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
right when this budding technology called the Internet

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
was going through a massive shift.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It was just starting to move from what people called Web 1

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
to Web 2.0.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sure, everybody knows about this in this room.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You all are here at South by Southwest, so you probably know this,

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
but Web 1 was essentially a read-only version of the Internet.

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
In retrospect, people call this 90s version of the Web

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
the static Web.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It was like AOL, where you could browse Web pages

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and read the news, but there was no easy way

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
for people to upload and share,

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and then in the early 2000s,

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
a slew of new companies like YouTube and Facebook

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and Twitter came onto the scene,

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and YouTube's motto was broadcast yourself.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The whole idea of Web 2

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
was that for the first time as a creative person,

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
you could easily participate on the Internet.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You could post and tweet and upload

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
instead of just being a passenger,

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and I thought that was fucking awesome.

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Honestly, I still think it's fucking awesome.

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's so easy to forget how magical this is,

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
how special this is,

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
but this moment in history marked a shift

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
for humanity and for artists and creators especially,

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
because for the first time on the Internet,

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
you could do more than just consume.

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You could create.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You could reach other people,

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and it was in that moment,

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
right here in 2007, when I had to graduate college

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and finish my record, Nightmares and Daydreams,

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and I was trying to reach people with it,

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and at the time, my best bet was DMing bands on Myspace

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and asking if I could open for them

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
at local bars up and down the West Coast.

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I sent cold outreach to music venues to get booked,

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and then I got in my car because I couldn't afford to rent a van,

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and I drove up and down the West Coast to the United States,

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and I played the dankest local bars,

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and I sang my guts out,

83
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and I sweated, and I sang, and I sweated, and I sang,

84
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and I ate tacos out of the back of my car

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
while my friends were all getting promoted

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
in high-paying jobs as investment bankers,

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
for years, tour after tour,

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and I'm using the word tour lightly here.

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Like, there weren't people at my shows.

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Like, nobody came!

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I had no fans!

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
On a good night, there were a couple stragglers

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
who wanted in off the street,

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
but I was playing empty bars.

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It was so hard to reach people.

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So you can imagine how excited I was

97
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
when a friend sent me a video of a guy named David Choi

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
singing with a guitar in front of his webcam

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
on a new website called YouTube.

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And this video had, like, 300,000 views

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
or something like that.

102
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I couldn't believe it! David was reaching people!

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This phase of the internet had the potential

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
to solve a fundamental problem for me as an artist.

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I felt like I had to jump in, and I did.

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I immediately started uploading videos to YouTube.

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Back then, no one else was showing

108
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
the, like, at-home recording process,

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
so I just filmed myself playing instruments,

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and then I layered them in the video with split screens

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
so people could see all the musical elements

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
coming together to form a song.

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And it's funny, because in 2023, this idea seems totally obvious,

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
but nobody was doing that back then.

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It wasn't a fancy recording studio

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
with millions of dollars' equipment.

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It was a bedroom with an M-Box audio interface

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and a cheap version of a laptop recording software

119
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
called Pro Tools LE and an old Sony handicap

120
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
that I lugged around with me everywhere

121
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
that shot on high eight tapes

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
and a bed comforter humming on the wall

123
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
to dampen the sound and broken cymbals

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
but I was making real music.

125
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I was screaming my fucking guts out

126
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and playing accordion and doing collabs with friends

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and it started working.

128
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
People started watching my videos and listening to my music.

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I was reaching people.

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
My videos started getting thousands of views.

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It wasn't millions of people at first,

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
but it was so much better than playing empty bars.

133
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So I kept doing it.

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And by 2009, I had made 43 YouTube videos of my songs

135
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and I was feeling amazing

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and the first time in my life,

137
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I was actually reaching people with my work.

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay, but the real beauty

139
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
of this new website called YouTube,

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
the most amazing thing about it,

141
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
was that it had a subscribe button.

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I only realized how truly special

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
this idea was in retrospect.

144
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But in my opinion, this concept turned out to be

145
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
one of the most important things

146
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
about this new era of the internet,

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
called Web 2.0.

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The subscribe button was foundational.

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It changed YouTube from being a tool to reach people,

150
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
to being a way to reach them

151
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and then build a following around my work.

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The subscribe button allowed people who liked my stuff

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
to sign up to see more of it in the future.

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And as a creator, it gave me a channel of distribution

155
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
to ensure that my future work was sent to those people.

156
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So it turned out that Web 2 solved more than just reach,

157
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
more than just discovery.

158
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It represented the birth of the follower.

159
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
In my opinion, the follow is not some handy feature

160
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
of a social network.

161
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The follow is foundational architecture

162
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
for human creativity and organization.

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The idea of a creator, an artist, or a community of fans

164
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
around them who want to see their future work,

165
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
this concept, the follow, it's profound.

166
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Whether it's the following that I was building as a musician

167
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
or a podcasting duo who talks about what it's like

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
to be single moms in a community of single mothers

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
who finally feel seen and understood

170
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
or a science education creator and students

171
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
who didn't previously have access to high quality education,

172
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
the follow was a system of organization

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
for the entire internet.

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It was a framework for the distribution of creativity

175
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and communication, not just reach,

176
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
but a step past it, ongoing communication,

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
connection, a sustained relationship, community.

178
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And I learned just how magical the concept of the following could be

179
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
when I did my first collab with my girlfriend Natalie.

180
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We put up a video on my YouTube channel in 2008

181
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
that was a song we created together,

182
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and it was different than my music.

183
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It was way less screamy and insane,

184
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
but it was more active and fleshed out than her music,

185
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
so we decided to create a new separate channel for our collabs

186
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and we called this new YouTube channel, Pomplimus.

187
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, all right, got some Pomplimus fans in the house, all right.

188
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
But we posted our first video,

189
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the first Pomplimus video was actually posted on my channel,

190
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and I had about 7,000 subscribers at the time,

191
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and my subscribers loved this new video.

192
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And at the end of it, we posted a little link

193
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
to the new Pomplimus channel to tell people about it,

194
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and almost instantly, the new Pomplimus channel

195
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
got 3,000 subscribers.

196
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's what a following is.

197
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
People see your new shit, literally they follow you,

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
wherever you go on the internet.

199
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So Natalie and I started making more videos and more videos,

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
and within a year, we got 18,000 subscribers,

201
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
and then in one video, we announced that we were playing a show,

202
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and we showed up to the show in San Francisco,

203
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and there were 40 people there, and oh my God, guys,

204
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I cannot tell you what it's like to have 40 people at your show

205
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
after years of playing empty bars.

206
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Fucking magic. It was amazing.

207
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It was so great.

208
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That night was such a great night.

209
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I feel like I literally can remember that.

210
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Another time, Natalie and I were filming a vlog

211
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
to put in one of our videos,

212
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
and my sister happened to walk in behind us,

213
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
and she was holding a bar.

214
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
She's a soap maker.

215
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
She was holding a bar of grapefruit-scented soap.

216
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Pomplimus means grapefruit in French.

217
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And she said, hey, guys, look, I have Pomplimus soap.

218
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And Natalie and I just saw that and decided to keep it in the video,

219
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and we put it up in the video,

220
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and our fans were like, oh my God, Pomplimus soap.

221
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We want a bar of Pomplimus soap.

222
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So we made another video, and we said, okay,

223
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
now you can order Pomplimus soap,

224
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and we got hundreds of orders for Pomplimus soap.

225
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Another time, when USB thumb drives were starting to get huge,

226
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
we thought, why do CDs?

227
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's put all of our music on a thumb drive.

228
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And so we did.

229
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And we loaded up the thumb drives.

230
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
We put up a video. We said, hey, if you want to buy a thumb drive,

231
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
you can buy a thumb drive now.

232
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
And we ended up selling hundreds and hundreds of thumb drives.

233
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We decided to sign every one of them,

234
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and it was really personal with our fans.

235
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And it was kind of crazy.

236
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We had to figure out the packaging.

237
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We had no idea how to package that many thumb drives.

238
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
My family ended up helping out.

239
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
My parents were freaking out.

240
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Dad's taking pictures and stuff.

241
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It was really fun. It was amazing.

242
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Another time, we decided to put our album on iTunes,

243
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
our first Pomplimus album back in 2008,

244
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and we didn't have artwork.

245
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So we asked our fans, hey, do you want to make the artwork

246
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
for a Pomplimus?

247
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And we got hundreds of submissions for the cover

248
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
of the new Pomplimus album from our fans.

249
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And they were freaking talented.

250
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Their artwork was amazing.

251
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This is the one that actually won.

252
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Natalie and I just love this one.

253
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So this is the artwork for our first album.

254
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It was made by one of our fans.

255
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Another time, we booked a show at a laundromat.

256
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That's a sentence I just said.

257
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We booked a show at a laundromat.

258
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The idea was like as a laundromat,

259
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
you could go order food, do your laundry,

260
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
eat by the time you're done eating, take your laundry home.

261
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That was the idea of a laundromat.

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And we booked the show.

263
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If you crammed people in there,

264
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
it held 60 people in this laundromat.

265
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And then we uploaded this video.

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And this was the first video that we ever uploaded

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
that went viral.

268
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And it got like half a million views overnight,

269
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and we showed up to our show at the laundromat,

270
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
and there were 200 people crammed inside the laundromat.

271
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And then 150 or 200 people outside,

272
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
like spilling in the street, cars were swerving around them.

273
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And like there was no stage.

274
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Like it's a laundromat.

275
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So literally, I'm playing music, and there's a person.

276
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Like I'm like looking out of person's eyes

277
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
while I'm playing pompomous songs.

278
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It was insane.

279
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Honestly, it was the first night.

280
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It was mayhem.

281
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't have any pictures of the night,

282
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
but this is what it felt like.

283
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Like it was just like insane.

284
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And this was the first time I was like,

285
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
oh my God, this is going to work.

286
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Like having a following is amazing.

287
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This is going to work.

288
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We're going to be able to be full-time musicians.

289
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Another time we posted another video.

290
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And at the end of the video, we told our fans,

291
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
hey, we're uploading a song to iTunes.

292
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We decided not to ever sign or kind of enter the music industry.

293
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
We did everything ourselves.

294
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We negotiated our own contract with iTunes directly.

295
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We posted our songs directly to iTunes.

296
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And so we kept almost, you know,

297
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
all of the revenue associated with that.

298
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And when we posted this album,

299
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
told our fans about it online, told our followers,

300
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
we sold 30,000 songs that month.

301
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And we got $22,000 deposited directly into our bank account.

302
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It was more money than I'd ever seen in one place,

303
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
ever in my life.

304
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I was losing my mind.

305
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It was so incredible.

306
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Then Pompomoo started playing shows,

307
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
and we started touring.

308
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
And, you know, hundreds of people started showing up.

309
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And then many hundreds of people,

310
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
and then thousands of people started showing up.

311
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And this is my wife, Crowdsurfing,

312
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
because she's a fucking badass.

313
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And that's what I mean when I say that the subscribe button

314
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
is not a silly feature.

315
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The concept of the follow changed my life.

316
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It made my dreams come true as an artist.

317
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It took me from playing empty bars

318
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
to living out my fantasy as a musician.

319
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The follow is a piece of internet architecture

320
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
that felt closer to magic than anything

321
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I had ever experienced in my life.

322
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Right around the moment that Pompomoo was starting to work,

323
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
right through all of this,

324
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
there is this genius named Kevin Kelly.

325
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Has anybody heard of Kevin Kelly?

326
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Founder of Wired, yeah, a bunch of people.

327
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Okay, amazing thinker and mind.

328
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
He wrote an essay called A Thousand True Fans.

329
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And his premise was simple.

330
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It was that in the age of the internet,

331
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
you don't need millions of fans to be successful.

332
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
If you can just find a thousand people

333
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
who are willing to buy 100 bucks of stuff from you per year,

334
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
that's $100,000 per year,

335
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
which is a pretty freaking great business as a creative person.

336
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You just need a thousand true fans

337
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
who really connect with you and believe in you.

338
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And this is different than just reaching people.

339
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's even deeper than followers.

340
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
This is super fans, true fans, real fans.

341
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Call it whatever you want.

342
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The idea is that there's this group of people that is your core.

343
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
If reach means people see it,

344
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and follower means people want to see more,

345
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
then true fans are the people who go to the shows

346
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
and buy the merch and download the record

347
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and pay for the course and get the live stream tickets

348
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
and all the things.

349
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And this idea really resonated with me.

350
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We had fans showing up to Pompomoo shows

351
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
with tattoos of the band.

352
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
We had fans literally making custom t-shirts

353
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
of Pompomoo posters, drawings, artwork, cookies.

354
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We had a fan do icing of my face on a cookie.

355
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I ate my face.

356
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
We had a fan who made an oil painting

357
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and me screaming my fucking guts out.

358
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I learned HTML and I had a little website.

359
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I used this link release software called eJunkie

360
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and I cobbled together like a little MP3 store

361
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
for myself on the internet.

362
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I would sell original music and I was selling 500 bucks a month

363
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
of my original songs on my own website

364
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
with my own shitty thing that I made.

365
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Fans were showing up to buy things, to be there.

366
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
One time we asked our Pompomoo fans

367
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
to come film a music video with us on a Saturday,

368
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
like show up to Dolores Park in San Francisco,

369
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
show up and be in this music video.

370
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
50 people showed up.

371
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
They even learned this dance.

372
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
We shot this dance.

373
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The dance is in this Pompomoo's video.

374
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Another time we would actually always use this software

375
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
called Stage It, which is like a ticketed live stream software.

376
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
We could play our songs.

377
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
People could buy tickets and show up live on the internet.

378
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Natalie and I would just sit at home

379
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and play these songs for 45 minutes

380
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and people would buy tickets and leave tips during the concert

381
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and we would routinely make like three grand

382
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
in 45 minutes playing our songs.

383
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's like these are true fans.

384
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Another time Natalie raised over $100,000

385
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
for her record from just 2,000 people.

386
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Another time we made a Pompomoo's album

387
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
and we went online on YouTube.

388
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
We put up this video and we said,

389
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
hey, everybody, we have a new Pompomoo's album.

390
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's not for sale.

391
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You can't buy it.

392
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You can't get the new Pompomoo's album.

393
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The only way to get the new Pompomoo's album

394
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
is if you donate a book to the Richmond School District

395
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
and then send us the receipt for that book

396
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
and we will send you the Pompomoo's album for free.

397
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Just donate a book.

398
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's super easy.

399
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
We'll send you the album in the mail for free.

400
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
And the Richmond School District

401
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
ended up having to rent a shipping container

402
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
to keep up with the packages.

403
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's like 11,000 books that got sent to the Richmond School.

404
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's like $140,000 worth of books.

405
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It was amazing.

406
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It felt incredible to see that many people show up for this.

407
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That's true fans, real fans, super fans.

408
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Call it whatever you want.

409
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But this was the concept that was rattling around in my head

410
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
when I started Patreon 11 years ago.

411
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This is actually the first sketch of Patreon.

412
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I called up my co-founder and he turned this

413
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
into what is now Patreon.

414
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And the idea was very simple.

415
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's like a membership platform

416
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
where fans could sign up for a subscription payment

417
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
to the creator and the creator could run a membership

418
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
and get paid for their work.

419
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm not going to tell the Patreon founding story.

420
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I've told it a million times.

421
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But the company is now over 400 people, 11 years in.

422
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
We have over 250,000 creators

423
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
who have made over $3.5 billion on the platform,

424
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
which I think of as proof, if we ever needed it,

425
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
that the true fans are there and the true fans are ready.

426
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Okay.

427
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
In the background, while Patreon was being formed,

428
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
building over the last decade,

429
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
the whole internet was again starting to shift.

430
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And if you think of the 90s as Web 1 and the 2000s as Web 2,

431
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
right around the 2010s, there was a new change happening.

432
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Facebook started experimenting with a new thing called ranking.

433
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And I realize most everybody here knows about this.

434
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Ranking did was essentially it took the feed,

435
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
which you can think of as a list of posts from creators that I follow,

436
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
and it analyzed each and every post for how engaging it was.

437
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And if it wasn't engaging enough,

438
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Facebook would then take that post and push it down in the feed.

439
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
In other words, they started ranking or ordering posts

440
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
according to what was best for their business.

441
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
This was actually great for Facebook.

442
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It was the right business decision for them and their company

443
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and their revenue model.

444
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But what it meant for creators was that for the first time since Web 2.0,

445
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
my followers might not necessarily see my posts.

446
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And this idea of a subscription started to break down.

447
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
If the person doesn't receive the things,

448
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
it's not really a direct true connection between a creator and their fans.

449
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's not really a subscription.

450
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The channel of distribution is broken.

451
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And it creates another problem too around creative freedom,

452
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
because now suddenly, my post has to be better than the other posts,

453
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
according to a set of criteria that I don't know or have control of

454
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
or even agree with.

455
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So instead of thinking, what do I want to make?

456
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What lights me up?

457
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What is the output that I want to create as an artist?

458
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What will my fans love?

459
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Instead of thinking those questions, now in the back of my mind,

460
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm thinking, what will the ranking algorithm favor?

461
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And that subconsciously or consciously changes my creative output

462
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
to achieve Facebook's goals, not my goals as a creator.

463
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And if it were just Facebook doing this, fine,

464
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
creators would just leave and post somewhere else.

465
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But it worked really well.

466
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It was great for Facebook's business.

467
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And people started spending even more time on the platform.

468
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So the other platforms had to compete.

469
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And YouTube launched the Cosmic Panda redesign,

470
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
centering the entire company around watch time.

471
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And Twitter and Instagram followed with ranked feeds in 2016.

472
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And we only saw it in retrospect.

473
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
But now I think of the 2010s as the decade of ranking,

474
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
the decade when the original promise of the creator-led community,

475
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
the true follow was broken for the first time.

476
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I want to just do a quick aside here,

477
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
because I know there's this big debate in the world

478
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
about chronological feeds versus algorithmic feeds.

479
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And I don't want to make it sound like I'm a zealot

480
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
on either of the two polarized sides.

481
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's actually not the takeaway here.

482
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's not how I think of it.

483
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I actually see problems with chronological feeds,

484
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
because as a creator, if it's chronological,

485
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
then you have to keep posting to stay on top.

486
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So I don't think that's necessarily the best way

487
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
to build strong relationships either.

488
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The problem that I have is if you're going to change that,

489
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
if you're going to adjust the way you create a feed,

490
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
what is the purpose behind that?

491
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What is the intention behind that?

492
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Are you trying to create a place

493
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
where you can build strength of relationship

494
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
with your community,

495
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
where your fandom gets energized over time,

496
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
where people are guaranteed that subscription,

497
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
where you get a direct connection with your community

498
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and your true fans?

499
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Is that it?

500
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Or is it maximizing attention?

501
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Is it maximizing watch time?

502
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Those are two very different goals

503
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
and very different ways of organizing

504
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
your entire product as a technology company.

505
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
This one helps me as a creator,

506
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
and this one hurts me as a creator.

507
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It hurts my community.

508
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It hurts my business.

509
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It hurts my creative output.

510
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I wish that it stopped there,

511
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
but around the turn of the decade,

512
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
a new company came onto the scene called TikTok,

513
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
and TikTok had a much deeper impact on the ecosystem

514
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I think anyone foresaw at the time.

515
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It wasn't just short form vertical first video.

516
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That wasn't it.

517
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That's a red herring, I think.

518
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It was much more fundamental than that.

519
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
TikTok said,

520
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
we want to make the most engaging feed possible.

521
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
This whole idea of a list of your subscriptions,

522
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
forget about that.

523
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
In fact, forget about the whole concept of subscriptions.

524
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
TikTok started from the ground up

525
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
with something totally different called For You,

526
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
where each of these posts are chosen for me by TikTok

527
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
instead of me choosing what's in my feed,

528
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
and this completely abandoned the concept of the follow.

529
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But it worked.

530
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
TikTok had a billion users by 2021,

531
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
and traffic on the internet started flowing away

532
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
from the legacy social companies and toward TikTok.

533
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So just like with Facebook and ranking,

534
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
the other platforms had to compete.

535
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
YouTube launched shorts,

536
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Instagram launched reels,

537
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and Twitter launched a For You feed as well,

538
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
and within a couple of years,

539
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
this whole system of organization for the internet,

540
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
the creator-led community,

541
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
started to fade into the past.

542
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I have really felt this personally as a creator

543
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
in the last four years, especially.

544
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
My fans don't see as much of my stuff anymore.

545
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's harder to sell tickets to a show.

546
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's harder to reach people with my new work.

547
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's harder to build community.

548
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's harder to build a business.

549
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's harder to energize my fans.

550
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I was curious for the creators and the audience.

551
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Are you feeling this too?

552
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Are folks in the room feeling this?

553
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm seeing nodding heads, raised hands.

554
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yes, okay.

555
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
This is, I just feel it.

556
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What's happening here is we are in the middle of another shift,

557
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
and this is a big one.

558
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
If the 90s was Web 1,

559
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
and the 2000s was Web 2,

560
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
and the 2010s was ranking,

561
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm worried that the 2020s

562
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
could become the death of the follower.

563
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I got an email from a creator

564
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
that I was spending a lot of time with

565
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
a little while ago, about a year and a half ago,

566
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and I got this email in my heart,

567
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
just sank in my stomach.

568
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Can we get the slide up? Great.

569
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Hey, Jack.

570
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm writing this letter to you hat in hand

571
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
due to changes at Facebook.

572
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Overnight, the traffic to my links in my page

573
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
is dropped by 80%.

574
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
As such, it looks like I'll have to sell my home.

575
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm dusting off my resume

576
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
and looking for jobs in social media management.

577
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
This is now,

578
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I'm seeing more and more of things like this,

579
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
and it's not just happening to creators.

580
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's happening to anyone who posts stuff on the internet.

581
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's happening to media companies.

582
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Look at what's happening to Vice and Buzzfeed

583
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and Rooster Teeth's announcement a couple of weeks ago.

584
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
This is a really hard change to navigate

585
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
for anyone who's posting stuff online

586
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
and trying to build community and business.

587
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
For the creators in the room,

588
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I think it's really important to remember that

589
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
and to understand that.

590
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
If you're not connecting

591
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
as much as you want to with your audience right now,

592
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
that does not necessarily mean

593
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
there's something wrong with you.

594
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
A lot of us as creators have this tendency to be like,

595
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
what can I do better?

596
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
And that's a good impulse, honestly.

597
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
It's like growth mindset.

598
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
How am I contributing to this?

599
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
What can I do better?

600
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And again, I think most of the time that's really good,

601
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
but there is also something happening in the background right now.

602
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's a macro thing that's happening on the web

603
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
that makes our jobs as creators really hard right now.

604
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
There's a lot of smart people at big companies

605
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
that are well-funded, big media companies,

606
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
trying to figure this out too,

607
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
and they're having trouble with it too.

608
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So as creators, just know that.

609
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
It doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong with you here.

610
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I believe that this problem is the single most important problem

611
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
that faces creative people today.

612
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The weakening of creator-led communities,

613
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
of our distribution channels to our fans.

614
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
This is the hardest, most challenging,

615
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
and most painful issue threatening the present

616
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
and the future of creativity on the internet.

617
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
So I want to be very clear about this.

618
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I actually, I don't think that this is going to happen.

619
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I don't think that we're actually going to see the real death of the follower.

620
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
That's not what I think is going to happen.

621
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I think the follow is too important to die.

622
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I think it's too valuable to ignore.

623
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I think it's too useful and awesome for creative people,

624
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
for publishers, for media companies,

625
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and I think the next wave of internet

626
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
and media technology companies are going to surge on this problem

627
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
and try to solve it.

628
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And it's actually already started.

629
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And the incumbents of the audience

630
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
are not going to be able to fight it

631
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
because their revenue relies on maximizing attention.

632
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
To drive their businesses, they're being forced up

633
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
towards discovery, towards reach, personalization, algorithmic curation.

634
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
These are the levers that drive attention

635
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
and therefore they drive their strategies.

636
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
That's why there's a whole already opening up

637
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
and why we're starting to see a whole new set of companies emerge

638
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
that look fundamentally different from the legacy social landscape.

639
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Discord and Kajabi and Fourth Wall and Gumroad Moment,

640
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
which Patreon acquired last year.

641
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
The Courses Platforms, Events Companies.

642
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Some people are calling this subset of companies the creator economy.

643
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I don't even think of it like that.

644
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's a fundamental shift in approach.

645
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And the hallmark strategy of the drivers of these businesses

646
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
is the focus on deeper connections,

647
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
as opposed to just more connections.

648
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
The true fan, the real fan, call it whatever you want.

649
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's the 5% of fans that drive 90% of the community and business.

650
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
This is a direct to fan business.

651
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
This is an ads business.

652
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
This is about depth of connection.

653
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
This is about maximizing attention.

654
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
This is about deeper fans.

655
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
This is about more fans.

656
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
And what binds this new wave of emerging companies

657
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
is that their strategic focus is down here.

658
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
The next decade of creative and media technology companies

659
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
will focus on building direct to fan connections

660
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
and community strength.

661
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
As creators, we'll still need the social platforms.

662
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
We'll still need those companies up here for discovery, for reach.

663
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
We need that.

664
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
But those companies will be one component

665
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
of the many tools that we have as creative people

666
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
to help us run our communities and businesses.

667
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That's where the world is going.

668
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm sure of it.

669
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
And personally, right now,

670
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I feel a sense of responsibility through this.

671
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I feel a sense of responsibility because

672
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I remember what it feels like to be a creator

673
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
on the outside of these platforms,

674
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
watching the internet move in a direction

675
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
that I don't agree with and that I don't like

676
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and that I don't think is good for my community and my business.

677
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I remember what that feels like.

678
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I remember feeling anxiety.

679
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I remember feeling fear.

680
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I remember feeling scared of where that was going

681
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and what it meant for me.

682
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And now, through whatever crazy life path

683
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I have been on as an artist,

684
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm now finding myself as a CEO

685
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
of one of these fucking tech companies

686
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and I feel this sense of

687
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I want to help build the type of internet

688
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
that I want as a creator.

689
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
That's what I want to do.

690
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So I really don't want this talk to feel like a Patreon ad.

691
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Actually, I really hope it doesn't.

692
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
But I do want to give you a sense

693
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
of how I'm thinking about this problem

694
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
given this seat that I'm in

695
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
and how Patreon is now thinking about this problem

696
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
and what we think our place is in it

697
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and what we want to do about it.

698
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And the headline is this.

699
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
It's been 20 or 30 years.

700
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And the current version of how art and community

701
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
exists on the internet today,

702
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't think is the right version.

703
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
How community and art exists on the web.

704
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I don't think it's the right way.

705
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And I want Patreon to contribute

706
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
to building a better version

707
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
of how art and community could exist on the internet.

708
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
We've oriented the whole company

709
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
around this problem.

710
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And we've been building a lot in the background

711
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
over the last couple of years,

712
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
but we made some big announcements a couple of months ago

713
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
about the next phase of Patreon

714
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
and how we're thinking about this problem.

715
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Specifically, we started as a membership platform

716
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
11 years ago, subscription payments.

717
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But we have built a lot,

718
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
especially in the last three years,

719
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
in an effort to take a more holistic approach

720
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
to building this.

721
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
We built video, community, podcasting,

722
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
better posting, a new media player, commerce,

723
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
free membership, which is essentially like a follow

724
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
gated on an email and live.

725
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And while this might look like a lot,

726
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
it's actually just three things,

727
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
media, community, and business.

728
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And we're now thinking of Patreon

729
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
no longer as a membership platform,

730
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
where we started,

731
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
but as this whole thing,

732
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
the media, community, and business foundation

733
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
for the next decade of professional creativity

734
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
on the internet,

735
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
organized around the concept of the true follow

736
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
in an effort to build a better way

737
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
that art can exist on the web.

738
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
That's the theory.

739
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
That's what the company is setting out to solve now.

740
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And in practice, what that looks like

741
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
is a new set of products and tools

742
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
that we built into Patreon.

743
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
This is our first foray into community.

744
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
And essentially this allows fans

745
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
to connect with each other

746
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
and build energized fandoms

747
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
and creators to hop in there and talk with fans.

748
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's a place for true fandom.

749
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Why do we build this?

750
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
What's the thinking? What's the strategy

751
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
and the idea behind this? Here's why.

752
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
As a creator on the internet today,

753
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I can get subscribers and I can get views

754
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and if I can send my fans to Instagram

755
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
or TikTok and they can be there,

756
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
but what I've noticed is those communities

757
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
degrade over time.

758
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
They don't get energized over time.

759
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
They get de-energized.

760
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
It gets harder and harder to reach those people.

761
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
I make a post. I reach 2% of my audience.

762
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I reach 1% of my audience.

763
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I lose touch with those people

764
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
and there's no way for me to find

765
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
those real fans, those true fans,

766
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
the small portion of my fans

767
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
that drive everything for me as a creator.

768
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
The way we're building this

769
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
and what I want as a creator

770
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
is a place where I can send my fans

771
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
and that fandom gets energy over time.

772
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
That fandom gets closer.

773
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That fandom gets more vibrant,

774
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
more connected over time,

775
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
more enthusiastic over time.

776
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
That's what I want as a creator.

777
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That's the space that I want to have

778
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
as a creative person.

779
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Creators deserve a place like that.

780
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
That is important.

781
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
It's important for the future of creativity.

782
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Another thing that we built

783
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
is commerce.

784
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Commerce allows creators

785
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
to sell a digital thing,

786
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
anything that you can sell online,

787
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
any digital thing.

788
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Why did we build this? Why did we build commerce?

789
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Because

790
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
creators

791
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
send lots of people to their Patreon,

792
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
millions of people to their Patreon pages every month.

793
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
What we found is

794
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
a lot of those people are true fans.

795
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
They're like the really intense,

796
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
interested, excited fans.

797
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
But not all of those fans

798
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
are ready to pay with a subscription payment.

799
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
In fact, a lot of them don't want to pay

800
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
with a subscription payment.

801
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
A lot of them.

802
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Why? Why don't they want to pay with a subscription payment?

803
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Either they have subscription fatigue,

804
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
which is a real thing,

805
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
or they're not in the right financial situation,

806
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
or they don't want to commit to a payment every month.

807
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
But they're still true fans.

808
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Rather than having those true fans

809
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
leave the creator,

810
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
we want to give creators a way

811
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
to start forming connections with those fans,

812
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
to build businesses with those fans.

813
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
We built commerce as a way

814
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
to participate in the creator's business

815
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
and community through this commerce product.

816
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Meanwhile, the creator can build

817
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
an awesome business along the way, too.

818
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
The logic is very similar for free membership.

819
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Why do we build free membership?

820
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
What is free membership, by the way?

821
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Think of this as a follow gated on your email.

822
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
It's kind of like an email capture,

823
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
almost, as a creator.

824
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It allows a fan to follow your page

825
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
without paying

826
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
in exchange for giving them your email.

827
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It's the same logic as commerce.

828
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
They're sending their true fans millions

829
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
every month to their Patreon pages.

830
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
And we wanted to give creators a way

831
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
to reach that portion of their fans

832
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
that they go to the shows,

833
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
they have the merch, they have the hat.

834
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
They're true fans, but for whatever reason,

835
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
they don't want to buy one of the things you have digitally,

836
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
and they don't want to pay a subscription.

837
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
And this allows creators

838
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
to continue forming relationships with those fans.

839
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
And what's super exciting about this

840
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
is we have found that about 40 to 50%

841
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
of these fans

842
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
actually say

843
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
that they intend to pay the creator

844
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
in the next few months.

845
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
They have high intention

846
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
to be a part of the creators' community and business.

847
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
And this gives creators a way

848
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
to start building community with those folks.

849
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Okay, we also

850
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
acquired a live experiences

851
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
platform called Moment.

852
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And I don't even

853
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
want to call it ticketed live streaming,

854
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
because it's so much more beautiful than that.

855
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Arjun and the team did such an incredible job

856
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
of building this place

857
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
for creators to sell tickets

858
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
to these live experiences,

859
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and they can debut their work.

860
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
A stand-up special, a movie that they've made,

861
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
a special episode

862
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
that they know is going to be a total banger,

863
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
whatever it is, it allows creators

864
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
to sell tickets to that experience

865
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
and then have community with those fans

866
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
while they're all watching it together.

867
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
And they've launched amazing creators,

868
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Tam and Paula and Bieber,

869
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
and they've worked with folks like Arjun Schultz,

870
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
to have that live community experience

871
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
and start gathering those community members

872
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
around their work.

873
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Okay, so

874
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
all that to say,

875
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
the way we're thinking about it,

876
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
and the way we're thinking about this next phase is that

877
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
we're not just a membership company anymore.

878
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
We're a true fan company.

879
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
We're a creator company.

880
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
We're building a better way for art and community

881
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
to exist on the internet.

882
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Because I want Patreon to build

883
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
an internet where creators have

884
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
true creative freedom.

885
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I want Patreon to contribute to a web

886
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
where creators have control of their businesses

887
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
and their careers.

888
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And I want it to feel like fire

889
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
to be part of a creator's community.

890
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I know what it feels like

891
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
to be part of an energized community.

892
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I remember it.

893
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And I have that same conviction now

894
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
that I did back in 2013 when I started Patreon.

895
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I know that it is possible

896
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
to build an internet where fandoms thrive

897
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and where professional creativity is possible

898
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
for anyone.

899
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I believe this in my bones.

900
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
It is not a choice.

901
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
It's not optimism.

902
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's just deep down what I actually know

903
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
to be available to humanity

904
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
if that is the path that we choose.

905
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Okay.

906
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
That's what Patreon is doing.

907
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
It's how we're thinking about this future

908
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
and Patreon's place in it.

909
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
But for the creators in the audience,

910
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
creators don't have to wait.

911
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Creators don't have to wait for this.

912
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Over the last decade,

913
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
I've talked to thousands of creative people.

914
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I've had my own creative projects.

915
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I've learned a lot.

916
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And I want to share just a few thoughts

917
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
about navigating the shifts

918
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
in the internet

919
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
and how we can all

920
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
prepare ourselves

921
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
and our communities for those shifts.

922
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
And we don't even need to wait

923
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
for any of the tech platforms

924
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
to catch up.

925
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Can I get next slide?

926
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Great.

927
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
The first,

928
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
invest in those true fans.

929
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Invest in the depth of connection.

930
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Not just new.

931
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It's not all about new views,

932
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
new subscribers, watch time up and to the right.

933
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
It's about depth.

934
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
It's about quality of interaction.

935
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
It's about finding that small portion of your fans

936
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
that are your engine,

937
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
that are your core,

938
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
that are your core.

939
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
And that's what I'm trying to reach them.

940
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Sometimes when I talk about this,

941
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
creators think,

942
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
does that mean like DMs?

943
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Should I be talking to individual fans?

944
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
No, not necessarily.

945
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
That's not actually what I mean.

946
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Finding those people

947
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
and building real connections with them

948
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
in whatever capacity you have.

949
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And my team will probably kill me for saying this.

950
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
It's not even using Patreon.

951
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
There's a bunch of ways that you can do this.

952
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm a little biased, but I think you could.

953
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
You could find

954
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
some other place

955
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
where you can build that community

956
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
with your true fans.

957
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
The point is find those people

958
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
and invest in that community.

959
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
That is the engine that will drive your business,

960
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
slingshot your business

961
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
through these shifts in the internet.

962
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Okay.

963
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
The second thing,

964
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
make beautiful things.

965
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
There is so much tension,

966
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
especially right now,

967
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
to make for the algorithm.

968
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And I've seen the diagrams.

969
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I've seen the charts.

970
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I've even drawn them in my history.

971
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Make for the algorithm, make for yourself,

972
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
and then make the things that help you build a business.

973
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
This is a Venn diagram, little center part,

974
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
and that's the sweet part. I've seen all that.

975
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And I get that.

976
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
But the gravity,

977
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
the gravity,

978
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
everywhere we look as creators today,

979
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
the gravity is just pushing us.

980
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
It's just pushing us toward

981
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
making for other reasons

982
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
than why we set out to make things in the first place.

983
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It's so important

984
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
to remember to make beautiful things,

985
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
to make things that light you up,

986
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
and to make things that you care about.

987
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
There's a wonderful metaphor that I love.

988
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
It's a business metaphor,

989
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
but it makes sense for creators too, I think.

990
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's a metaphor of the business

991
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
of the hot dog stand under the Eiffel Tower,

992
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
or the local restaurant.

993
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
And the hot dog stand in the Eiffel Tower

994
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
gets thousands of new customers

995
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
coming through their hot dog stand every day.

996
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It's just tourists just coming through.

997
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And they know they're going to get lots and lots of new customers,

998
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
and none of those people come back, but it doesn't matter,

999
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
because they're just always getting new customers every day

1000
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
because of the Eiffel Tower,

1001
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
and they just make hot dogs and sell them,

1002
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
and some portion of those customers buy their hot dogs.

1003
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Actually, you don't even have to be very good hot dogs.

1004
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
They just sell hot dogs. They know they're going to keep making money.

1005
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And that business works.

1006
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Like, it works. It's an okay business.

1007
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
There's another business, which is the local restaurant business,

1008
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
where the people there just focus on making

1009
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
great food and having great service.

1010
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And they actually are not in a place that gets a lot of foot traffic,

1011
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
so they don't get lots of new customers,

1012
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
but everybody in like a five-mile radius

1013
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
eats there twice a month.

1014
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And they just get lots of repeat customers

1015
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
because they've built trust,

1016
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
and they've built depth of connection with those people,

1017
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
and people know that restaurant

1018
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and love it and know they're going to have a great time

1019
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
when they're there.

1020
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
That is a great business.

1021
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You don't have to get lots of new

1022
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
and billions and acquisition,

1023
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
and you don't...

1024
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
That's not the only type of business you can build as a creator.

1025
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
There's this wonderful group of creators

1026
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
who are like, God, I've fallen in love with them.

1027
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Anybody heard of the YouTube New Wave?

1028
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Has anybody heard of these folks seeing some hands?

1029
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's this group of creators.

1030
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
They make these wonderful 30, 45-minute long form

1031
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
films, many documentaries

1032
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
about their lives and their struggles

1033
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
coming into the world and quitting college,

1034
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
and they're beautiful. It's incredible.

1035
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
They're patient, they're slow,

1036
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
the films are long,

1037
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
but, oh, my God,

1038
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
the depth of the message

1039
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
in these films is incredible,

1040
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
and they're building such a strong community

1041
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
around their work.

1042
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
People just love what they have to say

1043
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
and wait to see the next one.

1044
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
That's a real business.

1045
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
That's a real community.

1046
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
It's different than what we're incentivized to do

1047
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
everywhere on the Internet,

1048
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
but that works.

1049
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Okay.

1050
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
The last thing.

1051
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Ooh, that was loud.

1052
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Know what you want.

1053
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
The hardest lesson I have learned

1054
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
as a creative person

1055
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
and as an operator and CEO

1056
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
over the last 10 years

1057
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
is to know

1058
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
and trust what I want

1059
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
and to be true to that over time.

1060
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
That's easier said than done.

1061
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Don't let somebody else

1062
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
tell you what you want,

1063
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
because then you'll end up with what they want

1064
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
instead of what you want.

1065
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I think a good example of that

1066
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
is as creators,

1067
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
we open up our dashboards

1068
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
and we see

1069
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
these metrics on what success is.

1070
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
This is a dashboard that someone else

1071
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
built for us,

1072
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
and it tells us what we want,

1073
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
and the weird thing is after a couple of years,

1074
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
we start to believe that.

1075
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Our minds get reprogrammed

1076
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
and we believe this is what I want.

1077
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
This is success,

1078
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
and we chase that.

1079
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
If you went back in time

1080
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
and you asked Ella Fitzgerald

1081
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
or David Bowie or Prince,

1082
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
what do you want?

1083
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
What's your goal as an artist?

1084
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
What matters to you?

1085
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Do you think Bowie would have said,

1086
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
my goal as an artist

1087
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
is to maximize

1088
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
the amount of human hours

1089
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
spent consuming my work?

1090
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I don't know

1091
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
what Bowie wanted.

1092
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
I'm not going to pretend to,

1093
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
but I can tell you what I want as an artist.

1094
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
I can tell you what matters to me

1095
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
as a creative person,

1096
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
and what I know will matter to me

1097
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
10 years ago, now,

1098
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
and 10 years from now.

1099
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I want to say something

1100
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
that matters to somebody.

1101
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I want to say something that only I can say

1102
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
because of whatever experience

1103
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
I've had in my lived experience

1104
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
something that is uniquely

1105
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
pointed to me.

1106
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I want to say that.

1107
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I want to figure out how to say that.

1108
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I want to find that core of human truth

1109
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
in my experience

1110
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
and communicate it eloquently and clearly

1111
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
and have it be true and feel true

1112
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
and have someone else see that

1113
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
and have that person think,

1114
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
yes, that feels true

1115
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
and it feels true to them.

1116
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
And I want that person to feel connected to me

1117
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
that I've never met before in our lives.

1118
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
But I said a thing that resonated with them

1119
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
and made them feel a little bit less alone

1120
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
because they felt like there was another person

1121
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
who had that same experience.

1122
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I want to make things that are timeless.

1123
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I want to make things that feel true now.

1124
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I want to make things that feel true in 50 years.

1125
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I want to make things that still feel true

1126
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
500 years after I'm dead.

1127
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
I want to figure out how to use my

1128
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
short years on this planet

1129
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
to find that kind of truth and say it.

1130
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That's what I want

1131
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
as an artist.

1132
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And that's a very different goal

1133
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
than watch time.

1134
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
That may not be what you want

1135
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
as an artist and that's okay.

1136
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
But the point is to know

1137
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
what you want,

1138
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
what matters to you,

1139
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
what are you trying to achieve

1140
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
as a creative person.

1141
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
We have this tendency to look outside

1142
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
for those answers.

1143
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I do it too.

1144
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
This advice is honestly more for me

1145
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
than it is for anybody else in this room.

1146
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
We want there to be a Yoda.

1147
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
We want there to be a leader

1148
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
or a manager or a voice of authority

1149
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
that can tell us what we want

1150
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
because it's a scary thing to ask.

1151
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
But that does not exist.

1152
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
What we want comes

1153
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
intrinsically, not extrinsically.

1154
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It comes from in here.

1155
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
That's where we find it.

1156
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So as we navigate

1157
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
this next phase of the internet

1158
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
as creative people,

1159
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
as we go through these ups and downs

1160
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
of the web

1161
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
in its ever-evolving state,

1162
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
do not forget

1163
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
what matters to you as an artist.

1164
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Do not forget what fills you

1165
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
with pride to make.

1166
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Do not forget

1167
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
your purpose for making things

1168
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
in the first place.

1169
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Don't forget why you wake up in the morning

1170
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
and energy to your craft.

1171
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Don't forget what gives you

1172
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
a sense of meaning

1173
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
as a creative person.

1174
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
And lastly,

1175
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
don't forget to scream your fucking guts out.

1176
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Thank you, everybody. Appreciate you being here.

1177
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Thank you.

1178
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Thanks.

1179
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Thank you.

1180
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Thanks.

1181
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Thank you.

1182
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Thank you.
