00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
Calling all COBOL programmers.

00:02.720 --> 00:03.280
Hi, everybody.

00:03.280 --> 00:05.640
Carol Novie here for Tech Republic with Esther Shine.

00:05.640 --> 00:07.160
Thanks for being with us today, Esther.

00:07.160 --> 00:10.760
And who would have thought that a decades-old programming

00:10.760 --> 00:15.080
language would be this much on the forefront here

00:15.080 --> 00:16.920
of the minds of those who are trying

00:16.920 --> 00:20.840
to get things in order to file unemployment claims.

00:20.840 --> 00:25.640
And we are looking for those people who may be skilled

00:25.640 --> 00:26.360
in this arena.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.480
Let's start with just COBOL, the language of itself.

00:29.480 --> 00:31.000
First, talk a little bit about that.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.400
And then we'll get into why these programmers are so

00:33.400 --> 00:36.040
needed right now.

00:36.040 --> 00:37.440
Sure.

00:37.440 --> 00:43.080
So COBOL has been around, gosh, for about 60 years.

00:43.080 --> 00:48.280
And it was one of the first, if not the first, programming

00:48.280 --> 00:52.600
languages for those huge mainframe computers

00:52.600 --> 00:55.760
that you may have thought are no longer around,

00:55.760 --> 00:58.080
but they actually are.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.160
They are still the common platform

01:00.160 --> 01:04.960
for running government systems, like motor vehicle

01:04.960 --> 01:08.640
registration, real estate tax, income tax.

01:08.640 --> 01:11.280
And of course, right now, they're

01:11.280 --> 01:16.800
in the spotlight because a lot of states' unemployment systems

01:16.800 --> 01:21.640
run on a mainframe using COBOL.

01:21.640 --> 01:27.120
And we have a tremendous spike in unemployment claims

01:27.120 --> 01:32.840
being filed right now due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

01:32.840 --> 01:38.160
So programmers who know COBOL are in desperate need

01:38.160 --> 01:42.240
right now, which is pretty interesting.

01:42.240 --> 01:47.280
I also read a report by Reuters that found

01:47.280 --> 01:52.040
that there are still 220 billion lines of COBOL in use

01:52.040 --> 01:55.520
today, which is pretty stunning.

01:55.520 --> 01:59.920
And that 43% of banking systems are built on COBOL,

01:59.920 --> 02:08.040
and 95%, 95% of ATM swipes rely on COBOL code.

02:08.040 --> 02:11.440
So just let that sink in for a minute.

02:11.440 --> 02:14.680
COBOL is still very much alive and well,

02:14.680 --> 02:17.960
as are the mainframes they run on.

02:17.960 --> 02:20.160
Yeah, I think that that would shock people.

02:20.160 --> 02:22.800
Esther, we talk about Python and all of these languages

02:22.800 --> 02:26.760
that are the top languages, the hot languages.

02:26.760 --> 02:29.040
So often, we're talking about them here on Tech Republic

02:29.040 --> 02:29.880
and ZDNet.

02:29.880 --> 02:33.720
And if you're in school or looking to make a transition,

02:33.720 --> 02:37.160
and these are the languages you should look towards,

02:37.160 --> 02:41.240
but it's crazy to think that actually so much of our

02:41.240 --> 02:45.360
infrastructure involves COBOL, yet people aren't learning

02:45.360 --> 02:47.280
the language anymore.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.160
Right.

02:49.160 --> 02:55.560
And I had an interesting conversation with an analyst

02:55.560 --> 03:00.240
from IDC, and he said that even as desperate as states

03:00.240 --> 03:05.760
are to find programmers to help with the tremendous uptick

03:05.760 --> 03:09.840
in unemployment claims processing

03:09.840 --> 03:14.120
that they're looking for, he feels

03:14.120 --> 03:19.080
that that's not what the real problem is.

03:19.080 --> 03:23.640
He feels that modern mainframes are highly scalable,

03:23.640 --> 03:27.360
and getting more throughput is usually just a matter of paying

03:27.360 --> 03:31.160
to turn on more CPUs.

03:31.160 --> 03:34.960
But the problem is that states have

03:34.960 --> 03:40.360
had to make specific changes to these current applications

03:40.360 --> 03:43.360
they're using to accommodate the changes related

03:43.360 --> 03:46.520
to the unemployment process driven

03:46.520 --> 03:49.880
by the federal government's response to the crisis

03:49.880 --> 03:53.640
and the individuals who are affected by it.

03:53.640 --> 03:59.280
So surprisingly, COBOL skills are still

03:59.280 --> 04:02.240
maintained in the industry simply

04:02.240 --> 04:06.040
because state government, federal government,

04:06.040 --> 04:09.560
even large enterprises continue to have mainframes

04:09.560 --> 04:15.400
and COBOL applications to maintain.

04:15.560 --> 04:18.840
You won't find many COBOL developers anymore

04:18.840 --> 04:21.960
because it's not their preferred language.

04:21.960 --> 04:22.880
It's antiquated.

04:22.880 --> 04:26.560
And most do the maintenance of COBOL applications

04:26.560 --> 04:31.520
because they have to, not because they necessarily want to.

04:31.520 --> 04:35.040
And a problem that state governments face

04:35.040 --> 04:38.240
is that the chances are pretty good.

04:38.240 --> 04:41.440
They don't have the deep bench of professional developers

04:41.440 --> 04:44.680
that a large enterprise would have.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.360
And as a result, they haven't been

04:46.360 --> 04:51.200
able to replace COBOL programmers who have retired

04:51.200 --> 04:56.520
or build those skills across less senior employees.

04:56.520 --> 05:00.880
Yes, you can find consulting firms and offshoring services

05:00.880 --> 05:03.600
that will do development work in COBOL.

05:03.600 --> 05:09.400
But that's not going to help out states in the next week

05:09.400 --> 05:10.600
or so.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.200
Yeah, and that's what we're talking about.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.880
Time is of the essence, obviously,

05:14.880 --> 05:17.960
Esther, as we're trying to get these millions of claims

05:17.960 --> 05:20.280
processed across all of this state.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.960
So what can we do about it?

05:22.960 --> 05:25.440
How do we get people that are possibly in retirement

05:25.440 --> 05:27.800
to come back and help out?

05:27.800 --> 05:31.560
What can happen from here in a short amount of time?

05:31.560 --> 05:33.560
Sure.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.040
IBM and the Linux Foundation, I know,

05:36.040 --> 05:40.320
have teamed up on a free training course this week.

05:40.320 --> 05:42.720
So they're teaching the 60-year-old programming

05:42.720 --> 05:44.920
language coders.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.160
They've also launched a forum where

05:47.160 --> 05:49.760
people who have knowledge of COBOL

05:49.760 --> 05:53.040
can be matched with companies and state governments that

05:53.040 --> 05:58.400
are in need of help maintaining their critical systems.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.600
Some of these positions are paying.

06:01.600 --> 06:04.280
And of course, I believe the states

06:04.280 --> 06:08.120
are looking for volunteers to help right now,

06:08.120 --> 06:13.400
given how critical the need is with this unprecedented surge

06:13.400 --> 06:15.600
in people being laid off and having

06:15.600 --> 06:20.960
to file for unemployment benefits.

06:20.960 --> 06:28.680
And then IBM has also got some COBOL training material.

06:28.680 --> 06:33.920
And I know that I think in a few weeks,

06:33.960 --> 06:37.920
they're going to be launching a series of videos

06:37.920 --> 06:41.400
on platforms like Coursera.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.640
And they've got this talent match portal

06:44.640 --> 06:48.080
that's also being used to match programmers

06:48.080 --> 06:51.880
with companies and government organizations that

06:51.880 --> 06:54.000
need their help.

06:54.000 --> 06:54.520
Excellent.

06:54.520 --> 06:57.000
So really, just like a lot of things right now,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.520
asking American people to do what they can,

07:00.520 --> 07:02.920
step up in whatever way that they can.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.320
And certainly, this is a very niche area

07:05.320 --> 07:08.680
that they need people to come forward and say, yes, I can

07:08.680 --> 07:12.240
help and put my knowledge to work here.

07:12.240 --> 07:13.920
So really an interesting thing here.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.240
And I know the great thing is, Esther,

07:15.240 --> 07:18.000
you put together two great articles that

07:18.000 --> 07:20.720
explain the situation with COBOL and what's

07:20.720 --> 07:23.480
being done with the programs with IBM and things like that,

07:23.480 --> 07:26.560
and also have included some links there as well

07:26.560 --> 07:28.640
that people have to.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.960
So that's a great resource.

07:30.960 --> 07:36.320
Yeah, so I would just say that if you are a programmer

07:36.320 --> 07:43.200
and you're retired or you have some semblance of COBOL skills

07:43.200 --> 07:47.600
and maybe you feel you don't know enough,

07:47.600 --> 07:48.840
that's not an issue.

07:48.840 --> 07:49.960
You are wanted.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.640
You are still relevant.

07:51.640 --> 07:56.560
And if you're willing, there are plenty of people

07:56.560 --> 07:59.120
who could use your help right now.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.160
Most definitely.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.080
All right, very well said.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.760
Well, Esther, we appreciate it very much.

08:02.760 --> 08:06.240
And your article tier links, all of that, of course,

08:06.240 --> 08:07.520
can be found on TechRepublic.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.520
We hope all of you guys will check it out.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.560
And we certainly appreciate you watching.
