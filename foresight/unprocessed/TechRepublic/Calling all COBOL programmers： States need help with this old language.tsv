0	2720	Calling all COBOL programmers.
2720	3280	Hi, everybody.
3280	5640	Carol Novie here for Tech Republic with Esther Shine.
5640	7160	Thanks for being with us today, Esther.
7160	10760	And who would have thought that a decades-old programming
10760	15080	language would be this much on the forefront here
15080	16920	of the minds of those who are trying
16920	20840	to get things in order to file unemployment claims.
20840	25640	And we are looking for those people who may be skilled
25640	26360	in this arena.
26360	29480	Let's start with just COBOL, the language of itself.
29480	31000	First, talk a little bit about that.
31000	33400	And then we'll get into why these programmers are so
33400	36040	needed right now.
36040	37440	Sure.
37440	43080	So COBOL has been around, gosh, for about 60 years.
43080	48280	And it was one of the first, if not the first, programming
48280	52600	languages for those huge mainframe computers
52600	55760	that you may have thought are no longer around,
55760	58080	but they actually are.
58080	60160	They are still the common platform
60160	64960	for running government systems, like motor vehicle
64960	68640	registration, real estate tax, income tax.
68640	71280	And of course, right now, they're
71280	76800	in the spotlight because a lot of states' unemployment systems
76800	81640	run on a mainframe using COBOL.
81640	87120	And we have a tremendous spike in unemployment claims
87120	92840	being filed right now due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
92840	98160	So programmers who know COBOL are in desperate need
98160	102240	right now, which is pretty interesting.
102240	107280	I also read a report by Reuters that found
107280	112040	that there are still 220 billion lines of COBOL in use
112040	115520	today, which is pretty stunning.
115520	119920	And that 43% of banking systems are built on COBOL,
119920	128040	and 95%, 95% of ATM swipes rely on COBOL code.
128040	131440	So just let that sink in for a minute.
131440	134680	COBOL is still very much alive and well,
134680	137960	as are the mainframes they run on.
137960	140160	Yeah, I think that that would shock people.
140160	142800	Esther, we talk about Python and all of these languages
142800	146760	that are the top languages, the hot languages.
146760	149040	So often, we're talking about them here on Tech Republic
149040	149880	and ZDNet.
149880	153720	And if you're in school or looking to make a transition,
153720	157160	and these are the languages you should look towards,
157160	161240	but it's crazy to think that actually so much of our
161240	165360	infrastructure involves COBOL, yet people aren't learning
165360	167280	the language anymore.
167280	169160	Right.
169160	175560	And I had an interesting conversation with an analyst
175560	180240	from IDC, and he said that even as desperate as states
180240	185760	are to find programmers to help with the tremendous uptick
185760	189840	in unemployment claims processing
189840	194120	that they're looking for, he feels
194120	199080	that that's not what the real problem is.
199080	203640	He feels that modern mainframes are highly scalable,
203640	207360	and getting more throughput is usually just a matter of paying
207360	211160	to turn on more CPUs.
211160	214960	But the problem is that states have
214960	220360	had to make specific changes to these current applications
220360	223360	they're using to accommodate the changes related
223360	226520	to the unemployment process driven
226520	229880	by the federal government's response to the crisis
229880	233640	and the individuals who are affected by it.
233640	239280	So surprisingly, COBOL skills are still
239280	242240	maintained in the industry simply
242240	246040	because state government, federal government,
246040	249560	even large enterprises continue to have mainframes
249560	255400	and COBOL applications to maintain.
255560	258840	You won't find many COBOL developers anymore
258840	261960	because it's not their preferred language.
261960	262880	It's antiquated.
262880	266560	And most do the maintenance of COBOL applications
266560	271520	because they have to, not because they necessarily want to.
271520	275040	And a problem that state governments face
275040	278240	is that the chances are pretty good.
278240	281440	They don't have the deep bench of professional developers
281440	284680	that a large enterprise would have.
284680	286360	And as a result, they haven't been
286360	291200	able to replace COBOL programmers who have retired
291200	296520	or build those skills across less senior employees.
296520	300880	Yes, you can find consulting firms and offshoring services
300880	303600	that will do development work in COBOL.
303600	309400	But that's not going to help out states in the next week
309400	310600	or so.
310600	312200	Yeah, and that's what we're talking about.
312200	314880	Time is of the essence, obviously,
314880	317960	Esther, as we're trying to get these millions of claims
317960	320280	processed across all of this state.
320280	322960	So what can we do about it?
322960	325440	How do we get people that are possibly in retirement
325440	327800	to come back and help out?
327800	331560	What can happen from here in a short amount of time?
331560	333560	Sure.
333560	336040	IBM and the Linux Foundation, I know,
336040	340320	have teamed up on a free training course this week.
340320	342720	So they're teaching the 60-year-old programming
342720	344920	language coders.
344920	347160	They've also launched a forum where
347160	349760	people who have knowledge of COBOL
349760	353040	can be matched with companies and state governments that
353040	358400	are in need of help maintaining their critical systems.
358400	361600	Some of these positions are paying.
361600	364280	And of course, I believe the states
364280	368120	are looking for volunteers to help right now,
368120	373400	given how critical the need is with this unprecedented surge
373400	375600	in people being laid off and having
375600	380960	to file for unemployment benefits.
380960	388680	And then IBM has also got some COBOL training material.
388680	393920	And I know that I think in a few weeks,
393960	397920	they're going to be launching a series of videos
397920	401400	on platforms like Coursera.
401400	404640	And they've got this talent match portal
404640	408080	that's also being used to match programmers
408080	411880	with companies and government organizations that
411880	414000	need their help.
414000	414520	Excellent.
414520	417000	So really, just like a lot of things right now,
417000	420520	asking American people to do what they can,
420520	422920	step up in whatever way that they can.
422920	425320	And certainly, this is a very niche area
425320	428680	that they need people to come forward and say, yes, I can
428680	432240	help and put my knowledge to work here.
432240	433920	So really an interesting thing here.
433920	435240	And I know the great thing is, Esther,
435240	438000	you put together two great articles that
438000	440720	explain the situation with COBOL and what's
440720	443480	being done with the programs with IBM and things like that,
443480	446560	and also have included some links there as well
446560	448640	that people have to.
448640	450960	So that's a great resource.
450960	456320	Yeah, so I would just say that if you are a programmer
456320	463200	and you're retired or you have some semblance of COBOL skills
463200	467600	and maybe you feel you don't know enough,
467600	468840	that's not an issue.
468840	469960	You are wanted.
469960	471640	You are still relevant.
471640	476560	And if you're willing, there are plenty of people
476560	479120	who could use your help right now.
479120	480160	Most definitely.
480160	481080	All right, very well said.
481080	482760	Well, Esther, we appreciate it very much.
482760	486240	And your article tier links, all of that, of course,
486240	487520	can be found on TechRepublic.
487520	489520	We hope all of you guys will check it out.
489520	491560	And we certainly appreciate you watching.
