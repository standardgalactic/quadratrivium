1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Calling all COBOL programmers.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,280
Hi, everybody.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,640
Carol Novie here for Tech Republic with Esther Shine.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,160
Thanks for being with us today, Esther.

5
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,760
And who would have thought that a decades-old programming

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,080
language would be this much on the forefront here

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,920
of the minds of those who are trying

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,840
to get things in order to file unemployment claims.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,640
And we are looking for those people who may be skilled

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,360
in this arena.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,480
Let's start with just COBOL, the language of itself.

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,000
First, talk a little bit about that.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,400
And then we'll get into why these programmers are so

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,040
needed right now.

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,440
Sure.

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,080
So COBOL has been around, gosh, for about 60 years.

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,280
And it was one of the first, if not the first, programming

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,600
languages for those huge mainframe computers

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,760
that you may have thought are no longer around,

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,080
but they actually are.

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,160
They are still the common platform

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,960
for running government systems, like motor vehicle

23
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,640
registration, real estate tax, income tax.

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,280
And of course, right now, they're

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,800
in the spotlight because a lot of states' unemployment systems

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,640
run on a mainframe using COBOL.

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,120
And we have a tremendous spike in unemployment claims

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,840
being filed right now due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

29
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,160
So programmers who know COBOL are in desperate need

30
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,240
right now, which is pretty interesting.

31
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,280
I also read a report by Reuters that found

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,040
that there are still 220 billion lines of COBOL in use

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,520
today, which is pretty stunning.

34
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,920
And that 43% of banking systems are built on COBOL,

35
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:08,040
and 95%, 95% of ATM swipes rely on COBOL code.

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,440
So just let that sink in for a minute.

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,680
COBOL is still very much alive and well,

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,960
as are the mainframes they run on.

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,160
Yeah, I think that that would shock people.

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,800
Esther, we talk about Python and all of these languages

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,760
that are the top languages, the hot languages.

42
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,040
So often, we're talking about them here on Tech Republic

43
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,880
and ZDNet.

44
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,720
And if you're in school or looking to make a transition,

45
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,160
and these are the languages you should look towards,

46
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,240
but it's crazy to think that actually so much of our

47
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,360
infrastructure involves COBOL, yet people aren't learning

48
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,280
the language anymore.

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,160
Right.

50
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:55,560
And I had an interesting conversation with an analyst

51
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,240
from IDC, and he said that even as desperate as states

52
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,760
are to find programmers to help with the tremendous uptick

53
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,840
in unemployment claims processing

54
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,120
that they're looking for, he feels

55
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,080
that that's not what the real problem is.

56
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,640
He feels that modern mainframes are highly scalable,

57
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,360
and getting more throughput is usually just a matter of paying

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,160
to turn on more CPUs.

59
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,960
But the problem is that states have

60
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,360
had to make specific changes to these current applications

61
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,360
they're using to accommodate the changes related

62
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,520
to the unemployment process driven

63
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,880
by the federal government's response to the crisis

64
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,640
and the individuals who are affected by it.

65
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:59,280
So surprisingly, COBOL skills are still

66
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,240
maintained in the industry simply

67
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,040
because state government, federal government,

68
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,560
even large enterprises continue to have mainframes

69
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,400
and COBOL applications to maintain.

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,840
You won't find many COBOL developers anymore

71
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,960
because it's not their preferred language.

72
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,880
It's antiquated.

73
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,560
And most do the maintenance of COBOL applications

74
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,520
because they have to, not because they necessarily want to.

75
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,040
And a problem that state governments face

76
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,240
is that the chances are pretty good.

77
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,440
They don't have the deep bench of professional developers

78
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,680
that a large enterprise would have.

79
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,360
And as a result, they haven't been

80
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,200
able to replace COBOL programmers who have retired

81
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,520
or build those skills across less senior employees.

82
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,880
Yes, you can find consulting firms and offshoring services

83
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,600
that will do development work in COBOL.

84
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,400
But that's not going to help out states in the next week

85
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,600
or so.

86
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
Yeah, and that's what we're talking about.

87
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,880
Time is of the essence, obviously,

88
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,960
Esther, as we're trying to get these millions of claims

89
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,280
processed across all of this state.

90
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,960
So what can we do about it?

91
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,440
How do we get people that are possibly in retirement

92
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,800
to come back and help out?

93
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,560
What can happen from here in a short amount of time?

94
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Sure.

95
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,040
IBM and the Linux Foundation, I know,

96
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,320
have teamed up on a free training course this week.

97
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,720
So they're teaching the 60-year-old programming

98
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,920
language coders.

99
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,160
They've also launched a forum where

100
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,760
people who have knowledge of COBOL

101
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,040
can be matched with companies and state governments that

102
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,400
are in need of help maintaining their critical systems.

103
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,600
Some of these positions are paying.

104
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,280
And of course, I believe the states

105
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,120
are looking for volunteers to help right now,

106
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,400
given how critical the need is with this unprecedented surge

107
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,600
in people being laid off and having

108
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,960
to file for unemployment benefits.

109
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:28,680
And then IBM has also got some COBOL training material.

110
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,920
And I know that I think in a few weeks,

111
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,920
they're going to be launching a series of videos

112
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,400
on platforms like Coursera.

113
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,640
And they've got this talent match portal

114
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,080
that's also being used to match programmers

115
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,880
with companies and government organizations that

116
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,000
need their help.

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,520
Excellent.

118
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,000
So really, just like a lot of things right now,

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,520
asking American people to do what they can,

120
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,920
step up in whatever way that they can.

121
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,320
And certainly, this is a very niche area

122
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,680
that they need people to come forward and say, yes, I can

123
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,240
help and put my knowledge to work here.

124
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,920
So really an interesting thing here.

125
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,240
And I know the great thing is, Esther,

126
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,000
you put together two great articles that

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,720
explain the situation with COBOL and what's

128
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,480
being done with the programs with IBM and things like that,

129
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,560
and also have included some links there as well

130
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,640
that people have to.

131
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,960
So that's a great resource.

132
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,320
Yeah, so I would just say that if you are a programmer

133
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:43,200
and you're retired or you have some semblance of COBOL skills

134
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,600
and maybe you feel you don't know enough,

135
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,840
that's not an issue.

136
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,960
You are wanted.

137
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,640
You are still relevant.

138
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,560
And if you're willing, there are plenty of people

139
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,120
who could use your help right now.

140
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,160
Most definitely.

141
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,080
All right, very well said.

142
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,760
Well, Esther, we appreciate it very much.

143
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,240
And your article tier links, all of that, of course,

144
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,520
can be found on TechRepublic.

145
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
We hope all of you guys will check it out.

146
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,560
And we certainly appreciate you watching.
