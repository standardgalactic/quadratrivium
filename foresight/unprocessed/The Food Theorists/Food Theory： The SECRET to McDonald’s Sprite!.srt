00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Everyone knows that McDonald's Sprite tastes way better than just ordinary Sprite. Why is it so good?

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,520
What is the secret to McDonald's soda fountains?

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,200
It's a great question that's been circulating around the internet for the last five years,

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,600
and that is what I aimed to answer today.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,440
And let me tell you, the truth is in the place that you'd least suspect it.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,400
Hello internet! Welcome to Food Theory, the channel that hits different.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,040
For a while now, the internet's been obsessed with a fizzy mystery that is McDonald's Sprite.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,000
In case you've never had it, it's like perfectly chilled liquid pop rocks bursting with lemon lime flavor.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,120
The general consensus is that the Sprite being served out of McDonald's soda fountain is stronger,

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,000
giving it an electric, or even a spicy, taste.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,440
Why is it spicy?

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,040
You need to order a Sprite?

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,240
Extra spicy.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,360
Extra spicy?

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,960
Whoa, it's spicy!

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,800
Others have said that this stuff is so powerful it could probably fry fish.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,240
I'm at the price of fish, you want some?

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,520
Yeah, but we don't have a place.

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,640
I got something stronger, man.

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,560
Ah!

21
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,840
My personal favorite flavor comparison, though, is that it tastes like what a Super Saiyan 2 looks like.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,360
Crisp and full of lightning.

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,080
It's even gotten to the point where McDonald's and Sprite themselves have had to acknowledge this trend.

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,200
Hey everybody, Chris K here. I'm in the mood for some spice.

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,880
First, the spicy Sprite.

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,480
That's spicy.

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,200
But obviously, the next question that everyone has on their mind is,

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,280
what exactly makes the drink so explosive?

29
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,560
So good, so crisp.

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,720
Well, the internet has plenty of theories.

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,240
Food theories, trying to answer exactly that.

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,560
In general, the guesses circulating the internet boil down to four key factors.

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,040
The first is that the Sprite syrup getting shipped to the restaurants gets special treatment due to a

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,520
long-standing partnership between Coke and McDonald's.

35
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,440
Coke sends syrup in plastic bags to other restaurants and stores.

36
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,640
They send the syrup to McDonald's in stainless steel containers.

37
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,160
The second theory is that the carbonation levels are just higher at McDonald's.

38
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,720
So you get more carbonation, that's why it burns your nose.

39
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,680
Third is that the Sprite is extra sweet to better combat the saltiness of McDonald's fries.

40
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,440
McDonald's hired a sensory scientist and he found out that the salt that they use in their fries

41
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,920
enhances the flavor of the Sprite.

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,080
And finally, some have thrown all of that other stuff away and said that there's no difference,

43
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,080
but rather everything's the result of McDonald's having a larger straw.

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,280
Apparently, the straw is bigger, so you get more flavor in your mouth.

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,080
Okay, this one's definitely for who even rides this.

46
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,080
So today we're putting this debate to rest once and for all by digging into the facts

47
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,640
and then running our own battery of scientific tests.

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,440
Why is McDonald's Sprite so different?

49
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,160
Is it different?

50
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,000
Or is this just a self-fulfilling prophecy started by the internet hype machine

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,320
that now everyone just implicitly believes?

52
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,600
Get ready, theorists.

53
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,040
Today we obey our thirst, but follow the facts.

54
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,800
Now, before we get to my big taste experiment, putting all these theories to the test,

55
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,680
I think it makes sense to look at the possible explanations one at a time

56
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,080
to see if there's anything we can debunk right off the bat.

57
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,600
The first hypothesis that I've seen circulating around is that Coca-Cola

58
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,360
especially delivers the Sprite syrup to McDonald's restaurant in these large,

59
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,640
stainless steel tanks.

60
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,840
This is the result of a long-standing relationship between the two companies.

61
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,600
And right off the bat, this one does seem to be rooted in some amount of truth.

62
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,960
You see, the relationship between Coke and McDonald's started in the early days of the

63
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,280
restaurant's expansion, with the two companies partnering up and largely growing together.

64
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,920
Their relationship is so strong that Coke is contractually barred from selling syrup to

65
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,480
other restaurants for less than what McDonald's pays, even if it means costing them business.

66
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,920
There's even a division at Coca-Cola dedicated to specifically McDonald's business, aptly named

67
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,040
the McDonald's division.

68
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,920
Look, they're saving the creativity for the marketing and not the department naming.

69
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,440
Needless to say, Coke works closely with McDonald's to make sure that they have

70
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,320
everything they need to deliver their product in the best way possible.

71
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,520
And in turn, McDonald's spends a large amount of resources to ensure that they're

72
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,400
given their customers the best Coca-Cola experience they can.

73
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,320
But does any of this actually affect the way that syrup is being shipped?

74
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,200
Yes, it does.

75
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,960
You see, the concept of delivering the syrup in stainless steel vats makes a lot of sense.

76
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,320
The steel helps ensure that the syrup's flavor is the purist it can be.

77
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,160
And when you look at the reality of the situation, Coke is indeed sending

78
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,160
syrups to McDonald's and steel vats.

79
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,200
There's just one problem.

80
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,040
It's not Sprite syrup.

81
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,000
According to James McIntyre, a franchise owner from Pennsylvania,

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,320
not all Coke products get the same treatment.

83
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,600
Dessert for Coca-Cola?

84
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,520
That arrives in stainless steel tanks.

85
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,680
The Sprite, however, does not.

86
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,280
It instead comes in the standard plastic bags that everyone else is using.

87
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,600
That's right, it's just a box lined with a plastic bag.

88
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,720
We even went to our local McDonald's and asked to speak to the manager,

89
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,480
in the least caring way possible, to see if we could get confirmation of any of this.

90
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,200
And yep, only Coca-Cola gets the stainless steel vat treatment, not Sprite.

91
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,680
So that's one major theory debunked right off the bat.

92
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,040
Next up, the water quality and overall level of carbonation.

93
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,960
As hype around McDonald's soda is circulated across the internet for the past five years,

94
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,000
various sources have started to come clean about how clean McDonald's soda fountains really are.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,160
And it's here that our friend James McIntyre,

96
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,960
that franchise owner from Pennsylvania I talked about in the last paragraph,

97
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,160
helps us out again, revealing that McDonald's has not one,

98
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,160
but four different water filtration systems that the water has to go through

99
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,240
before it ever makes it to the soda tower.

100
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,520
This process includes a state-of-the-art reverse osmosis filter

101
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,160
that works by applying pressure to the unfiltered water,

102
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,640
forcing it through a membrane and into a storage tank,

103
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,080
which in turn helps remove dissolved minerals, bacteria, and other solids.

104
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,680
This makes the water virtually tasteless before the syrup gets mixed in,

105
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,760
thereby ensuring a consistent flavor profile wherever you're going in the country.

106
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,560
Usually a restaurant or a gas station that has itself a soda fountain

107
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,040
is gonna connect the water line directly to the machine.

108
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,760
Rarely are they incorporating a filter, let alone four.

109
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,680
This makes the process simpler and cheaper,

110
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,320
but apparently McDonald's isn't afraid to spend a little bit more.

111
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,840
But it's not all about purity.

112
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
Once the water is squeaky, clean, and tasteless,

113
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,800
the next step in the process is for them to make it sub-zero.

114
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,240
Uh, alright, not exactly sub-zero, but just really, really cold.

115
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,920
See, the other big difference is the temperature that McDonald's keeps everything at.

116
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,000
Normally other soda fountains are set to flash-chill their sodas as they're being dispensed,

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,240
so that they come out cold, but not cold-cold.

118
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,000
The golden arches on the other hand are pre-chilling not only the filtered water,

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,880
but also the syrup to the perfect range between 33 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit,

120
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,720
just above freezing temperatures.

121
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,360
This range is important because it's the optimal temperatures for the carbonation of the water.

122
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,520
You see, CO2, or carbon dioxide, the chemical compound that makes fizzy drinks,

123
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,520
fizz, has a higher rate of absorption and dispersion in colder liquids.

124
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,280
In other words, the colder the liquid is, the more carbonation it's able to have.

125
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,840
This is why warm drinks tend to go flat quicker.

126
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,680
The gas is able to escape more easily.

127
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,280
So with the sprite's water and syrup both being pre-chilled,

128
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,920
it's preventing any unwanted fluctuations in temperature

129
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,640
when the water and syrup get mixed together in the soda fountain.

130
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,880
In other words, the claim that McDonald's sprite is more carbonated is technically true,

131
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,960
but not for the reasons that you would expect.

132
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,560
It appears like it has more to do with the colder temperatures of the water and syrup

133
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,600
rather than any sort of artificial increase in the amount of actual bubbles being shoved into the mix.

134
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,680
But then, what about the syrup-to-water ratio?

135
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,160
One of the biggest myths that you see circulating around the internet

136
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,960
is that the syrup-to-water ratio coming out of McDonald's fountains

137
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,120
is actually higher than what's being served up in a typical bottle or can of sprite,

138
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,760
thereby making their soda sweeter and thus more flavorful or stronger to the drinkers.

139
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,040
This is one, though, that McDonald's themselves have publicly shut down,

140
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,440
saying that there's no special formula they have.

141
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,920
That said, I'm not just gonna naturally trust a corporation.

142
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,120
Can we take their word for it?

143
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,080
The answer is actually somewhere between yes and no,

144
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,280
while McDonald's claims to strictly adhere to the Coca-Cola standard

145
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,920
of one-to-five water-sirrup ratio or one ounce of syrup to every five ounces of water,

146
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,760
they do take into consideration the ice that's being added into the drink,

147
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,240
meaning that they have a slightly higher syrup content,

148
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
but it's done so that once ice is added,

149
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,280
you're tasting the equivalent of the standard one-to-five ratio.

150
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,880
So, pro tip to all of you watching,

151
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,360
don't skip the ice the next time you drink at McDonald's.

152
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,920
You're gonna ruin the ratio, you'll ruin the art,

153
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,760
and it'll just be a tad bit too sweet.

154
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,000
So we've gotten our cup of sprite straight out of the fountain,

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,560
nice and cold with just the right amount of ice and flavor,

156
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,280
but there's still something else at work here, the fries.

157
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,640
Rumor number three states that McDonald's hired sensory scientists

158
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,320
to help optimize how the sweet sprite pairs with the salty fries,

159
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,640
all in order to make the perfect combination.

160
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,120
And anecdotally, there's evidence to back this one up.

161
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,960
According to some sources, McDonald's has developed a special ketchup recipe,

162
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,520
one that's sweeter and tangier than other brands

163
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,120
that is specifically designed to match the saltier flavor of their fries.

164
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,000
Now, according to my research, this has never been outright confirmed,

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,040
but it is known that the company uses extensive taste testing

166
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,520
to ensure that their products are as delicious as possible,

167
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,800
and if they're doing it with ketchup,

168
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,840
is it that much of a stretch to believe that they're doing it with the sodas as well?

169
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,560
But that's not all.

170
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,720
Back in the ancient days of the 1980s,

171
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,960
when cars were powered by feet like the Flintstones,

172
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,760
the French fries at McDonald's were fried using beef tallow

173
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,920
instead of the canola oil that they use today.

174
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,120
This made for an insanely rich, savory fry taste.

175
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,000
Unfortunately, beef tallow is also incredibly unhealthy.

176
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
So in the 90s, when the public grew more concerned

177
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,680
about the saturated fats in their foods,

178
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,080
they made the switch to plain old vegetable oil.

179
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,160
Customers obviously started to complain,

180
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,640
so McDonald's began adding natural beef flavorings to mimic the old beloved flavor.

181
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,080
Yep, that means that the fries at McDonald's are not vegan-friendly,

182
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,160
so uh, sorry any of you vegans out there

183
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,800
that have been happily munching down on the golden goodness.

184
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,360
But hey, at least they did have to pay $10 million as part of a lawsuit because of that very fact.

185
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,560
Anyway, today their French fries still contain that rich umami flavor

186
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,320
from the added beef flavoring and salt.

187
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,960
Couple that with the refreshing acidity and sweetness of the sprite,

188
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
and you have yourself the bliss point.

189
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,520
A term coined by market researcher Howard Moskowitz

190
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,720
when describing the perfect balance of sugar, salt, and fat.

191
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,160
These two complete each other like a fast food rom-com come to life,

192
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,200
but none of it is gonna matter if you're just guzzling the sprite like an animal.

193
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,480
And this, my friends, is where one of the smallest parts of this process

194
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,200
makes itself the biggest difference, the straw.

195
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,680
Hypothesis number four, the size of the straw.

196
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,360
Most people don't give the straw a second thought,

197
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,240
but McDonald's gave it a second, third, and fourth thought.

198
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,600
For example, did you know that McDonald's straws are actually wider than normal?

199
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,960
Yeah, the diameter of a standard drinking straw is 0.24 inches,

200
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,440
but a McDonald's straw has a diameter of 0.284 inches.

201
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,800
Now, that might not sound like that much,

202
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,440
but it's enough of a difference that a normal straw can actually fit inside of a McDonald's one.

203
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,680
And just how much of that is changing the drink experience?

204
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,520
Well, the advantage of drinking through a straw is that it delivers less liquid into your mouth,

205
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,560
allowing you to warm it up faster and get more aroma and flavor

206
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,240
through volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, for short.

207
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,200
VOCs help produce aromas of the food and drinks that we consume,

208
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,880
aromas that are intensified and become more complex when they warm up.

209
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,760
That's why if you were to just take a giant swig of freezing sprite,

210
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,440
you'd barely be able to taste much outside of the brain freeze that's ravaging your head.

211
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,120
But with a straw, it limits the amount of liquid that you can take into your mouth at a time,

212
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,080
which lets it warm up briefly and at the same time improves air circulation in the mouth when you drink.

213
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,320
The straw is also helping out with the carbonation because,

214
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,080
while a straw might seem smooth to us,

215
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,520
there are actually tons of tiny little bumps and indentations in there,

216
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,400
all places where carbon dioxide molecules can attach to,

217
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,360
thereby creating more bubbles, promoting more effervescence.

218
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,720
This is why paper straws, which have even more imperfections,

219
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,040
can cause carbonated drinks to go crazy.

220
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,760
Or at least that's how the science should play out.

221
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,640
But does any of this actually make that substantial of a difference?

222
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,600
It's finally time to put all these variables to the test.

223
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,360
Take it away, live-action MatPat.

224
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,720
Alright, so with all our variables set and ready to go,

225
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,840
it's time to actually put our money where our mouth is.

226
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,480
Or put our sprite where our mouth is.

227
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,720
I am joined on the couch by HR representative Rachel.

228
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,960
Hello, happy to be here.

229
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Is that the lore that I should build for you at this point?

230
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,880
That's sure. That sounds fancier than I am.

231
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,240
So before you, we have a bunch of different varieties of sprite,

232
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,280
so we can actually get a side-by-side taste test

233
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,240
on what truly is the best version of sprite.

234
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,680
We also have variables of different straw sizes,

235
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,960
so we can see if straw size is playing a factor in all of this.

236
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,760
And then lastly, we have the fries.

237
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,440
Right over here, it's lunchtime, which is great.

238
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,880
We have some fries, so we can test out whether this sprite

239
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,160
is specifically engineered to complement the saltiness

240
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,720
of the McDonald's fry, or if that's just a myth

241
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,000
and they're all equally the same.

242
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,760
So, how do you feel about sprite?

243
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,120
I love sprite, and I expect them all to taste the same,

244
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,000
but I'm going to enjoy them all.

245
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,280
Yeah, you think they're all going to taste the same?

246
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,360
Well, I think with the fries, I think we're going to like that one.

247
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,240
For the vibes.

248
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,280
Really, for the vibes.

249
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,680
Purely vibes. Purely off of vibes.

250
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,200
But I don't think they're going to be that different.

251
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,720
I firmly disagree.

252
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,280
Really?

253
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,000
100%.

254
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,480
Long, long-term viewers of our channels will know

255
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,000
that I can taste-test the difference between Diet Coke

256
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,440
from can to bottle to fountain to glass.

257
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,520
Like, it's very easy for me to...

258
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,200
Even from different restaurant franchises,

259
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,560
I can tell you different Diet Cokes.

260
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,760
I'm an addict.

261
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,080
I wouldn't be surprised if this taste is vastly different.

262
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,800
So, without any further ado, let's crack these guys open, shall we?

263
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
You want me to...

264
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,800
This isn't a twist-off.

265
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,600
Do we have a can up here?

266
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,640
Do we have a can up here?

267
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,440
Here, let's go for it.

268
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,240
A bottle opener or something?

269
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,520
You just did it with your teeth.

270
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,320
Sure.

271
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,360
Just a talent.

272
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,280
Okay. Pleasant.

273
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,760
Sprite.

274
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,400
Tastes like Sprite.

275
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,680
It tastes like Sprite.

276
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,760
It's not as carbonated,

277
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,160
but this is a good baseline of Sprite,

278
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,760
not as carbonated as I expected,

279
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,920
but also doesn't have that spiciness that you associate with Sprite.

280
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,880
It's well-balanced.

281
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,400
Yeah, it's actually very smooth.

282
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:08,800
It is.

283
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,080
It's a smooth Sprite.

284
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,960
All right, here's the big boy.

285
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:14,800
Huh.

286
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,120
I don't know what to do with that.

287
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,760
I don't either.

288
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,360
This feels flatter.

289
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,040
It feels fizzier, this one does.

290
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,480
Right, that one feels fizzier.

291
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,640
I don't know if the fizz has a flavor,

292
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,320
but it does change.

293
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,080
The fizz is what really feels like it gives you that crispiness,

294
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,720
or the little bit of the Sprite burn.

295
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,360
And it does feel like when this one goes through this straw,

296
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,280
this one feels bubblier.

297
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,760
It does.

298
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,880
Whereas this guy does not.

299
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,960
No trouble with that one.

300
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,320
Right, thanks.

301
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,360
Thank you, but should I enlist your teeth for this one?

302
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,600
Huh.

303
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,240
Okay, that one has less flavor to me.

304
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,200
I agree with that.

305
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,040
It doesn't have much to do with the carbonation,

306
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,800
but it does feel less sweet.

307
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,920
You're trying this one again?

308
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,960
Well, maybe they're not as different as I thought.

309
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,680
So Sprite all really tastes the same.

310
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,080
Yeah.

311
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,280
It's very similar.

312
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,360
There's differences in carbonation,

313
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,480
but I feel like the taste is consistent.

314
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,280
It does feel like the taste is consistent across the board.

315
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,160
It is purely based off of carbonation,

316
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,400
and less to do with the flavor mix.

317
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,040
The more carbonation it feels like the less sweet it is,

318
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,720
whereas like this is more carb,

319
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,320
that's the flattest one so far.

320
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,640
The other ones have like an airy feel.

321
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,640
We did an episode a long time ago about champagne,

322
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,880
and about how the glass bottles of the champagne

323
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,320
and why you pour it into glass,

324
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,880
because it's able to retain the smaller bubbles better.

325
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,200
Oh.

326
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,200
And so I'm wondering if the glass bottle of the Sprite

327
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
is actually playing into that in some way,

328
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,720
and it's functioning in some way.

329
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,280
That was nice.

330
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,080
I was able to do that one too, sorry.

331
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,000
I should have offered it to your teeth first, my bad.

332
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,080
This is so vastly different.

333
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,040
There's a lot of bubbles happening.

334
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,680
Those are close with the bubbles.

335
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,640
In terms of the teeny bubbles?

336
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,280
Tiny bubbles.

337
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,400
But it almost feels like this one has the most flavor.

338
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,440
This is so bubbly.

339
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,840
It because the other ones are just so carbonated.

340
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,040
I feel like it's distracting.

341
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,880
So what have we learned here?

342
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,280
What is the most different Sprite?

343
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,760
They all, to me, taste the same.

344
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,240
Yes.

345
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,960
This one, I get a little bit of a sense of the can.

346
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,560
This one tastes a bit watery because of the ice.

347
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,680
This one is very bubbly through a straw

348
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,880
relative to the other ones.

349
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,040
But as far as the flavor difference?

350
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,880
Not a ton.

351
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,760
And I'm surprised.

352
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,680
My hypothesis, like I said at the beginning of the thing,

353
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
my hypothesis was that it would be very easy

354
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,080
to tell a flavor difference between all four of these

355
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,080
in much the same way that you do with Diet Coke.

356
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,120
I sit here and I think I'm completely wrong about that.

357
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,440
All right.

358
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,600
So with round one of the tests complete,

359
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,080
I think let's move on to the big boy straws.

360
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,320
So this is what McDonald's is primed to give you, right?

361
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,880
You already do that?

362
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,680
Yours is better than mine.

363
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,040
I have a four-year-old.

364
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,240
I do it slightly more frequently.

365
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,040
That's valid.

366
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,880
I blew, speaking of my four-year-old,

367
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
I blew Ollie's mind one time

368
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,640
by showing him the Giga straw.

369
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,040
There it is.

370
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,920
Why do you call it that?

371
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,880
The Giga straw?

372
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,080
To this more?

373
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:16,400
Yes.

374
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,160
Because it's more.

375
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,880
Obviously we have a bigger boy straw.

376
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,440
So now it's time to compare the flavor of the two, right?

377
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,880
Does the higher volume of stuff

378
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,480
that you're getting in your mouth through this one

379
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,920
complement this type of sprite?

380
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,360
Does it change things at all?

381
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,280
Does it affect the amount of carbonation

382
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,640
and bubbles that you're tasting?

383
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,200
So without any further ado, back to the rounds.

384
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,640
I might need a Giga straw for this soon.

385
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,640
It's good down there.

386
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,400
It's easier to drink.

387
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,520
It tastes the same.

388
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,960
It still tastes like sprite.

389
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,000
It tastes the same.

390
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,120
Spoiler alert, drinking it through a big straw

391
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,840
has not changed the fact that it is still sprite.

392
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,320
There you go, Matt.

393
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,680
You can open this one.

394
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,400
Oh, thanks.

395
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,760
Please don't.

396
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,040
That old plan.

397
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,320
He should need to break it.

398
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,960
He gave you a can opener.

399
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,280
He did?

400
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,360
It's on the air.

401
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,040
It's a can opener of defeat.

402
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,120
So wait, let's do the side by side real quick.

403
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,240
So we got thin straw.

404
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,520
Okay, thin straw versus thick boy.

405
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,480
Interesting.

406
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,440
We do it side by side.

407
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,160
The bubbles don't come through quite as much.

408
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,320
Right.

409
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,120
It's a little bit easier.

410
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,480
Yeah, it's interesting.

411
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,440
Because the straw has texture on the inside,

412
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,400
the soda's coming through it,

413
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,560
so it's activating a lot of those bubbles, right?

414
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,120
Here, because you're getting more fluid

415
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,560
and less surface area,

416
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,320
you're going to get less bubbles overall.

417
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,920
And that's exactly what I'm tasting here.

418
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,520
This one, the smaller straw,

419
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,720
is giving me stuff that is decidedly more bubbly

420
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,240
and concentrated in the bubbles.

421
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,120
This is a much more balanced flavor for this guy.

422
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,560
This is a moment of truth.

423
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:48,800
Huh.

424
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,640
Interesting.

425
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:50,800
What is that?

426
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,240
I'm curious to get your opinion.

427
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,440
I don't want to color any judgment.

428
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,240
To me, it's the same.

429
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:54,560
Really?

430
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,040
Yeah.

431
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,520
Interesting.

432
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,760
Here.

433
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,560
Stir it again.

434
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,760
I think for some reason,

435
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,240
you almost lose the carbonation with the small straw

436
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,160
and it comes back more with the big one.

437
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,440
I don't think it's there quite as much

438
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,960
as the other ones still,

439
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,760
but it is more balanced, for sure.

440
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,720
Maybe I'm just consuming my drinks like a maniac.

441
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,120
It's sicko mode.

442
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,960
Like, oh, I'm drinking the whole thing.

443
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
And it's not giving me much of a flavor difference,

444
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,200
but it's giving me like...

445
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,160
To mouth feel.

446
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,200
Yeah, it's a weird mouth feel thing, right?

447
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,520
Where having more fluid hitting my mouth faster

448
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,320
is more satisfying in some way.

449
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,000
When I'm drinking this,

450
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,520
I find it much more enjoyable

451
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,360
going through this straw than this straw.

452
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,840
I think it's just a whole experience.

453
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,160
Not 100% sure what it is,

454
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,920
but with both of the two,

455
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
I would opt for the bigger straw.

456
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,680
Even though I couldn't necessarily tell you

457
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,600
why I'm opting for the bigger straw,

458
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,280
I like it better.

459
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,920
For the vibes.

460
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,280
For the vibes.

461
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,600
Yeah.

462
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,240
For the vibes.

463
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,680
Same thing.

464
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,080
These straws are just too small.

465
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,400
They create too much carbonation.

466
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,440
And as a result,

467
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,480
I don't get the flavor of the soda

468
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,160
as much as just a bunch of bubbles

469
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,520
and I don't like that much carbonation.

470
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,680
That's significantly different.

471
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,480
Carbonation.

472
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,280
Yeah, between the two.

473
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,960
Yeah, the flavor stays the same.

474
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,840
Through all of them, I think.

475
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,320
But the carbonation affects the flavor.

476
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,880
It does.

477
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,200
100% cross the board in every single one of these.

478
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,120
Big straw is the better option.

479
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,400
The flavor is better with less carbonation.

480
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,320
So maybe McDonald's' secret sauce here

481
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
isn't so much about like

482
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,240
the flavor or anything like that.

483
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,640
It really boils down to the straw.

484
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,480
But what's interesting, right,

485
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,720
is as we continue to drink this,

486
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,440
as I get overwhelmed with the flavor of Sprite,

487
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,640
I appreciate the watered-down,

488
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
icy, you know, this is the guy

489
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,960
that has the watered-down Sprite flavor.

490
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,320
Whereas the other ones are just pure and unconcentrated.

491
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,680
And so, like you said,

492
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,320
this one tastes slightly different

493
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,120
as a result of that.

494
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,800
It tastes more mild.

495
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,240
It's more soothing.

496
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,560
And so, like, I feel like I can drink more of this.

497
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,000
And this one at this point

498
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,600
is like my favorite of these.

499
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah.

500
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,760
Because it's not just cloying the entire time.

501
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,840
Yeah, it does feel more refreshing.

502
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,560
I feel like that's...

503
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,320
If I had to drink all of one of these,

504
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:12,960
that one's bigger.

505
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,920
So I don't know if that's fair.

506
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,200
But I would drink more of that one.

507
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,240
Yeah, it's mellower now at this point.

508
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,760
Again, because of the ice.

509
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,320
But as a result, I actually like it better.

510
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,640
So maybe what the conclusion here

511
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,200
is that normal Sprite is just too strong of a soda.

512
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,440
And they just need to chill it out a little bit.

513
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,160
Maybe.

514
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,240
I mean, there's just a lot going on

515
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,960
with flavor and carbonation in all of these.

516
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,960
And that takes a little bit of it away, which is nice.

517
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,480
Which brings us to the final variable,

518
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,480
which is the fries.

519
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,280
The French fries.

520
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:45,600
Right?

521
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,880
So now the question is,

522
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,520
will the Sprite from McDonald's

523
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
be specifically engineered

524
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,880
to complement the flavor

525
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,480
and the saltiness of the McDonald's, right?

526
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,120
Because we've ultimately decided that the syrup

527
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,640
tastes largely the same,

528
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,560
I don't think that's going to be the case.

529
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,360
I'm not super hopeful on this one, to be honest with you.

530
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,000
This is better with fries than the bottle.

531
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,480
I agree.

532
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,040
Maybe just the sweetness of it.

533
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,440
Oh, I don't like the fries with the bottle.

534
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,040
This just feels right.

535
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,600
Right?

536
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,160
What is it?

537
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,880
It's sweeter.

538
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,000
I almost think the opposite.

539
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,560
Really?

540
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,120
Where I think these two that I just tried

541
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,760
are so sweet and so flavored.

542
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,280
Whereas this one, again,

543
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,480
has a little bit of that wateriness to it,

544
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,880
which balances, like, it's mellower

545
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,240
and a little bit waterier,

546
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,680
which balances out against the, like,

547
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,280
salty greasiness of the fry.

548
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,200
If you were to ask me which one I would want,

549
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,360
just, like, by natural impulse,

550
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,200
which one are you drinking with these fries?

551
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,840
Hands down.

552
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,560
Hands down.

553
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,200
Hands down.

554
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,840
Hands down.

555
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,320
Right?

556
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,040
And again, is it a flavor difference?

557
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,080
No.

558
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,640
It is more refreshing.

559
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,520
It is.

560
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,160
And it's got to be a mix of, like,

561
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,400
water and carbonation,

562
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,240
and it's refreshing.

563
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,160
I feel like it's probably a combination

564
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,240
of everything that we've talked about today, right?

565
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,280
There is an element of the ice

566
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,320
that's mixed into this,

567
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,080
which makes it slightly more refreshing.

568
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,920
There is an element of the straw,

569
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,360
which makes it more consumable.

570
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,800
And then, yeah, as I keep going back

571
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,240
to the other sprites,

572
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,280
all the other sprites have just that,

573
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,880
again, like, such a strong flavor

574
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,760
as opposed to this guy,

575
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,880
which is different in a good way.

576
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,440
Yeah.

577
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,240
Top tier.

578
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,040
Top tier.

579
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,360
Why?

580
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,000
I don't know.

581
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,120
Yeah, yeah.

582
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,920
It's top tier and not in a way

583
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,680
that you can clearly articulate,

584
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,880
but is better.

585
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,440
Yeah.

586
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,480
So there you have it.

587
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,680
After rigorous testing

588
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,360
and absolutely attacking our stomachs

589
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,000
with sugar,

590
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,440
we found that McDonald's sprite

591
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,200
does indeed hit different,

592
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,960
but not for the reasons you might expect.

593
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,040
To start, the carbonation was actually

594
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
less in the McDonald's sprite than the others.

595
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,560
We didn't really feel that snap,

596
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,840
crackle, or pop,

597
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,480
but you know what?

598
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,040
It worked.

599
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,560
And we're not the only ones to think so.

600
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,200
This one kind of tasted too fizzy for me.

601
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,280
I actually kind of like these better than that one.

602
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,480
The lack of carbonation there

603
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,320
was a real surprise considering the science

604
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,840
behind the McDonald's process.

605
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,040
The cold filtered water

606
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,640
should have allowed for more carbonation,

607
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,840
but the ice and the rate at which

608
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,120
the plastic cup heated up

609
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,480
might have affected the fizziness.

610
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,320
We also found that the flavor was milder

611
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,520
and a little bit sweeter.

612
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,200
Ultimately, it amounted to an overall

613
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,720
more pleasant experience,

614
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,000
and was the drink that we agreed

615
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
would be the one that we'd keep coming back to.

616
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,720
But in the end,

617
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,880
the one variable that made the biggest difference

618
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,400
across all the taste tests

619
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,840
is the bigger straw.

620
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,360
The fact that, I gotta be honest,

621
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,200
was absolutely shocking to me.

622
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,040
The wider straw made the perfect balance

623
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,240
so you got enough fluid

624
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,440
so you could taste the flavors,

625
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,320
but also adding in just the right amount of bubbles.

626
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,600
And even though Rachel and I

627
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,800
didn't quite see eye to eye

628
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,000
on what made the fountain sprite

629
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,600
our favorite to partner with the fries,

630
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,960
it was in a different league

631
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,920
than any of the others

632
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,840
in terms of how refreshing it was to drink

633
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,720
and how well it worked

634
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,560
with all that salty greasiness.

635
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,120
In the end,

636
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,720
the secret to McDonald's sprite

637
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,920
wasn't a matter of taste,

638
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,200
which makes sense considering

639
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,560
there's nothing special about the syrup

640
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,760
that McDonald's is using

641
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,120
nor the container they keep it in.

642
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,600
Instead,

643
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,120
it was a matter of how pleasant

644
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,600
the entire drink experience ended up being.

645
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,200
It's a finely tuned process

646
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,040
that takes into account everything

647
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,920
from temperature,

648
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,720
the amount of ice,

649
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,920
to straw your sipping through,

650
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,280
the dishes that you're enjoying

651
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,240
alongside the drink,

652
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,520
all of those things combined

653
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,840
to make McDonald's sprite truly special.

654
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,240
And sure,

655
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,920
it didn't quite make me feel like static,

656
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,880
a lightning or the meteor

657
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,160
that killed the dinosaurs,

658
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,520
but we obeyed our thirst,

659
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,720
and I was quenched.

660
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,920
It'll quench ya.

661
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,840
Nothing's quenched here.

662
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,280
It's the quenched here.

663
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,240
But hey,

664
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,000
that's just a theory.

665
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
A food theory.

666
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,280
Bottoms up.
