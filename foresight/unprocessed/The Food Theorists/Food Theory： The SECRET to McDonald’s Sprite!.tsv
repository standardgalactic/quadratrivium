0	4800	Everyone knows that McDonald's Sprite tastes way better than just ordinary Sprite. Why is it so good?
4800	7520	What is the secret to McDonald's soda fountains?
7520	11200	It's a great question that's been circulating around the internet for the last five years,
11200	13600	and that is what I aimed to answer today.
13600	17440	And let me tell you, the truth is in the place that you'd least suspect it.
19360	24400	Hello internet! Welcome to Food Theory, the channel that hits different.
24400	29040	For a while now, the internet's been obsessed with a fizzy mystery that is McDonald's Sprite.
29040	34000	In case you've never had it, it's like perfectly chilled liquid pop rocks bursting with lemon lime flavor.
34000	39120	The general consensus is that the Sprite being served out of McDonald's soda fountain is stronger,
39120	42000	giving it an electric, or even a spicy, taste.
42000	43440	Why is it spicy?
43440	45040	You need to order a Sprite?
45040	46240	Extra spicy.
46240	47360	Extra spicy?
47360	48960	Whoa, it's spicy!
48960	52800	Others have said that this stuff is so powerful it could probably fry fish.
52800	54240	I'm at the price of fish, you want some?
54240	55520	Yeah, but we don't have a place.
55520	56640	I got something stronger, man.
57440	58560	Ah!
58560	63840	My personal favorite flavor comparison, though, is that it tastes like what a Super Saiyan 2 looks like.
63840	65360	Crisp and full of lightning.
65360	70080	It's even gotten to the point where McDonald's and Sprite themselves have had to acknowledge this trend.
70080	73200	Hey everybody, Chris K here. I'm in the mood for some spice.
73200	74880	First, the spicy Sprite.
75680	76480	That's spicy.
76480	79200	But obviously, the next question that everyone has on their mind is,
79200	81280	what exactly makes the drink so explosive?
81280	82560	So good, so crisp.
82560	84720	Well, the internet has plenty of theories.
84800	88240	Food theories, trying to answer exactly that.
88240	92560	In general, the guesses circulating the internet boil down to four key factors.
92560	97040	The first is that the Sprite syrup getting shipped to the restaurants gets special treatment due to a
97040	99520	long-standing partnership between Coke and McDonald's.
99520	103440	Coke sends syrup in plastic bags to other restaurants and stores.
103440	106640	They send the syrup to McDonald's in stainless steel containers.
106640	110160	The second theory is that the carbonation levels are just higher at McDonald's.
110160	112720	So you get more carbonation, that's why it burns your nose.
112720	117680	Third is that the Sprite is extra sweet to better combat the saltiness of McDonald's fries.
117680	123440	McDonald's hired a sensory scientist and he found out that the salt that they use in their fries
123440	125920	enhances the flavor of the Sprite.
125920	130080	And finally, some have thrown all of that other stuff away and said that there's no difference,
130080	134080	but rather everything's the result of McDonald's having a larger straw.
134080	137280	Apparently, the straw is bigger, so you get more flavor in your mouth.
137280	140080	Okay, this one's definitely for who even rides this.
140080	144080	So today we're putting this debate to rest once and for all by digging into the facts
144080	146640	and then running our own battery of scientific tests.
146640	149440	Why is McDonald's Sprite so different?
149440	150160	Is it different?
150160	154000	Or is this just a self-fulfilling prophecy started by the internet hype machine
154000	156320	that now everyone just implicitly believes?
156320	157600	Get ready, theorists.
157600	161040	Today we obey our thirst, but follow the facts.
161040	164800	Now, before we get to my big taste experiment, putting all these theories to the test,
164800	167680	I think it makes sense to look at the possible explanations one at a time
167680	170080	to see if there's anything we can debunk right off the bat.
170080	173600	The first hypothesis that I've seen circulating around is that Coca-Cola
173600	177360	especially delivers the Sprite syrup to McDonald's restaurant in these large,
177360	178640	stainless steel tanks.
178640	181840	This is the result of a long-standing relationship between the two companies.
181840	185600	And right off the bat, this one does seem to be rooted in some amount of truth.
185600	188960	You see, the relationship between Coke and McDonald's started in the early days of the
188960	193280	restaurant's expansion, with the two companies partnering up and largely growing together.
193280	197920	Their relationship is so strong that Coke is contractually barred from selling syrup to
197920	202480	other restaurants for less than what McDonald's pays, even if it means costing them business.
202480	207920	There's even a division at Coca-Cola dedicated to specifically McDonald's business, aptly named
207920	209040	the McDonald's division.
209040	211920	Look, they're saving the creativity for the marketing and not the department naming.
211920	215440	Needless to say, Coke works closely with McDonald's to make sure that they have
215440	218320	everything they need to deliver their product in the best way possible.
218320	221520	And in turn, McDonald's spends a large amount of resources to ensure that they're
221520	224400	given their customers the best Coca-Cola experience they can.
224400	228320	But does any of this actually affect the way that syrup is being shipped?
228320	229200	Yes, it does.
229200	232960	You see, the concept of delivering the syrup in stainless steel vats makes a lot of sense.
232960	236320	The steel helps ensure that the syrup's flavor is the purist it can be.
236320	240160	And when you look at the reality of the situation, Coke is indeed sending
240160	242160	syrups to McDonald's and steel vats.
242160	243200	There's just one problem.
243200	245040	It's not Sprite syrup.
245040	248000	According to James McIntyre, a franchise owner from Pennsylvania,
248000	250320	not all Coke products get the same treatment.
250320	251600	Dessert for Coca-Cola?
251600	253520	That arrives in stainless steel tanks.
253520	255680	The Sprite, however, does not.
255680	259280	It instead comes in the standard plastic bags that everyone else is using.
259280	261600	That's right, it's just a box lined with a plastic bag.
261600	264720	We even went to our local McDonald's and asked to speak to the manager,
264720	268480	in the least caring way possible, to see if we could get confirmation of any of this.
268480	273200	And yep, only Coca-Cola gets the stainless steel vat treatment, not Sprite.
273200	275680	So that's one major theory debunked right off the bat.
275680	279040	Next up, the water quality and overall level of carbonation.
279040	282960	As hype around McDonald's soda is circulated across the internet for the past five years,
282960	288000	various sources have started to come clean about how clean McDonald's soda fountains really are.
288000	290160	And it's here that our friend James McIntyre,
290160	292960	that franchise owner from Pennsylvania I talked about in the last paragraph,
292960	296160	helps us out again, revealing that McDonald's has not one,
296160	300160	but four different water filtration systems that the water has to go through
300160	302240	before it ever makes it to the soda tower.
302240	305520	This process includes a state-of-the-art reverse osmosis filter
305520	308160	that works by applying pressure to the unfiltered water,
308160	310640	forcing it through a membrane and into a storage tank,
310640	314080	which in turn helps remove dissolved minerals, bacteria, and other solids.
314080	317680	This makes the water virtually tasteless before the syrup gets mixed in,
317680	321760	thereby ensuring a consistent flavor profile wherever you're going in the country.
321760	324560	Usually a restaurant or a gas station that has itself a soda fountain
324560	327040	is gonna connect the water line directly to the machine.
327040	329760	Rarely are they incorporating a filter, let alone four.
329760	331680	This makes the process simpler and cheaper,
331680	334320	but apparently McDonald's isn't afraid to spend a little bit more.
334320	335840	But it's not all about purity.
335840	337840	Once the water is squeaky, clean, and tasteless,
337840	340800	the next step in the process is for them to make it sub-zero.
340800	344240	Uh, alright, not exactly sub-zero, but just really, really cold.
344240	347920	See, the other big difference is the temperature that McDonald's keeps everything at.
347920	352000	Normally other soda fountains are set to flash-chill their sodas as they're being dispensed,
352000	354240	so that they come out cold, but not cold-cold.
354240	358000	The golden arches on the other hand are pre-chilling not only the filtered water,
358000	362880	but also the syrup to the perfect range between 33 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit,
362880	364720	just above freezing temperatures.
364720	369360	This range is important because it's the optimal temperatures for the carbonation of the water.
369360	373520	You see, CO2, or carbon dioxide, the chemical compound that makes fizzy drinks,
373520	377520	fizz, has a higher rate of absorption and dispersion in colder liquids.
377520	381280	In other words, the colder the liquid is, the more carbonation it's able to have.
381280	383840	This is why warm drinks tend to go flat quicker.
383840	385680	The gas is able to escape more easily.
385680	389280	So with the sprite's water and syrup both being pre-chilled,
389280	391920	it's preventing any unwanted fluctuations in temperature
391920	394640	when the water and syrup get mixed together in the soda fountain.
394640	398880	In other words, the claim that McDonald's sprite is more carbonated is technically true,
398880	400960	but not for the reasons that you would expect.
400960	404560	It appears like it has more to do with the colder temperatures of the water and syrup
404560	409600	rather than any sort of artificial increase in the amount of actual bubbles being shoved into the mix.
409600	411680	But then, what about the syrup-to-water ratio?
411680	414160	One of the biggest myths that you see circulating around the internet
414160	416960	is that the syrup-to-water ratio coming out of McDonald's fountains
416960	421120	is actually higher than what's being served up in a typical bottle or can of sprite,
421120	425760	thereby making their soda sweeter and thus more flavorful or stronger to the drinkers.
425760	429040	This is one, though, that McDonald's themselves have publicly shut down,
429040	431440	saying that there's no special formula they have.
431440	433920	That said, I'm not just gonna naturally trust a corporation.
433920	435120	Can we take their word for it?
435120	438080	The answer is actually somewhere between yes and no,
438080	441280	while McDonald's claims to strictly adhere to the Coca-Cola standard
441280	445920	of one-to-five water-sirrup ratio or one ounce of syrup to every five ounces of water,
445920	449760	they do take into consideration the ice that's being added into the drink,
449760	452240	meaning that they have a slightly higher syrup content,
452240	454240	but it's done so that once ice is added,
454240	457280	you're tasting the equivalent of the standard one-to-five ratio.
457280	458880	So, pro tip to all of you watching,
458880	461360	don't skip the ice the next time you drink at McDonald's.
461360	463920	You're gonna ruin the ratio, you'll ruin the art,
463920	465760	and it'll just be a tad bit too sweet.
465760	468000	So we've gotten our cup of sprite straight out of the fountain,
468000	470560	nice and cold with just the right amount of ice and flavor,
470560	473280	but there's still something else at work here, the fries.
473280	476640	Rumor number three states that McDonald's hired sensory scientists
476640	480320	to help optimize how the sweet sprite pairs with the salty fries,
480320	482640	all in order to make the perfect combination.
482640	485120	And anecdotally, there's evidence to back this one up.
485120	488960	According to some sources, McDonald's has developed a special ketchup recipe,
488960	491520	one that's sweeter and tangier than other brands
491520	495120	that is specifically designed to match the saltier flavor of their fries.
495120	498000	Now, according to my research, this has never been outright confirmed,
498000	501040	but it is known that the company uses extensive taste testing
501040	503520	to ensure that their products are as delicious as possible,
503520	504800	and if they're doing it with ketchup,
504800	507840	is it that much of a stretch to believe that they're doing it with the sodas as well?
507840	508560	But that's not all.
508560	510720	Back in the ancient days of the 1980s,
510720	512960	when cars were powered by feet like the Flintstones,
512960	515760	the French fries at McDonald's were fried using beef tallow
515760	517920	instead of the canola oil that they use today.
517920	521120	This made for an insanely rich, savory fry taste.
521120	524000	Unfortunately, beef tallow is also incredibly unhealthy.
524000	526000	So in the 90s, when the public grew more concerned
526000	527680	about the saturated fats in their foods,
527680	530080	they made the switch to plain old vegetable oil.
530080	532160	Customers obviously started to complain,
532160	536640	so McDonald's began adding natural beef flavorings to mimic the old beloved flavor.
536640	540080	Yep, that means that the fries at McDonald's are not vegan-friendly,
540080	542160	so uh, sorry any of you vegans out there
542160	544800	that have been happily munching down on the golden goodness.
544800	549360	But hey, at least they did have to pay $10 million as part of a lawsuit because of that very fact.
549360	552560	Anyway, today their French fries still contain that rich umami flavor
552560	554320	from the added beef flavoring and salt.
554320	556960	Couple that with the refreshing acidity and sweetness of the sprite,
556960	558960	and you have yourself the bliss point.
558960	561520	A term coined by market researcher Howard Moskowitz
561520	564720	when describing the perfect balance of sugar, salt, and fat.
564720	568160	These two complete each other like a fast food rom-com come to life,
568160	571200	but none of it is gonna matter if you're just guzzling the sprite like an animal.
571200	574480	And this, my friends, is where one of the smallest parts of this process
574480	577200	makes itself the biggest difference, the straw.
577200	579680	Hypothesis number four, the size of the straw.
579680	581360	Most people don't give the straw a second thought,
581360	584240	but McDonald's gave it a second, third, and fourth thought.
584240	587600	For example, did you know that McDonald's straws are actually wider than normal?
587600	590960	Yeah, the diameter of a standard drinking straw is 0.24 inches,
590960	595440	but a McDonald's straw has a diameter of 0.284 inches.
595440	596800	Now, that might not sound like that much,
596800	601440	but it's enough of a difference that a normal straw can actually fit inside of a McDonald's one.
601440	603680	And just how much of that is changing the drink experience?
603680	607520	Well, the advantage of drinking through a straw is that it delivers less liquid into your mouth,
607520	610560	allowing you to warm it up faster and get more aroma and flavor
610560	614240	through volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, for short.
614240	617200	VOCs help produce aromas of the food and drinks that we consume,
617200	620880	aromas that are intensified and become more complex when they warm up.
620880	623760	That's why if you were to just take a giant swig of freezing sprite,
623760	627440	you'd barely be able to taste much outside of the brain freeze that's ravaging your head.
627440	631120	But with a straw, it limits the amount of liquid that you can take into your mouth at a time,
631120	636080	which lets it warm up briefly and at the same time improves air circulation in the mouth when you drink.
636080	638320	The straw is also helping out with the carbonation because,
638320	640080	while a straw might seem smooth to us,
640080	643520	there are actually tons of tiny little bumps and indentations in there,
643520	646400	all places where carbon dioxide molecules can attach to,
646400	649360	thereby creating more bubbles, promoting more effervescence.
649360	652720	This is why paper straws, which have even more imperfections,
652720	655040	can cause carbonated drinks to go crazy.
655040	657760	Or at least that's how the science should play out.
657760	660640	But does any of this actually make that substantial of a difference?
660640	663600	It's finally time to put all these variables to the test.
663600	665360	Take it away, live-action MatPat.
665360	668720	Alright, so with all our variables set and ready to go,
668720	671840	it's time to actually put our money where our mouth is.
671840	674480	Or put our sprite where our mouth is.
674480	678720	I am joined on the couch by HR representative Rachel.
678800	680960	Hello, happy to be here.
680960	682960	Is that the lore that I should build for you at this point?
682960	684880	That's sure. That sounds fancier than I am.
686560	690240	So before you, we have a bunch of different varieties of sprite,
690240	693280	so we can actually get a side-by-side taste test
693280	696240	on what truly is the best version of sprite.
696240	699680	We also have variables of different straw sizes,
699680	702960	so we can see if straw size is playing a factor in all of this.
702960	705760	And then lastly, we have the fries.
705760	707440	Right over here, it's lunchtime, which is great.
707440	710880	We have some fries, so we can test out whether this sprite
710880	714160	is specifically engineered to complement the saltiness
714160	716720	of the McDonald's fry, or if that's just a myth
716720	718000	and they're all equally the same.
718000	719760	So, how do you feel about sprite?
719760	723120	I love sprite, and I expect them all to taste the same,
723120	724000	but I'm going to enjoy them all.
724000	725280	Yeah, you think they're all going to taste the same?
725280	729360	Well, I think with the fries, I think we're going to like that one.
729360	730240	For the vibes.
730240	731280	Really, for the vibes.
731280	733680	Purely vibes. Purely off of vibes.
733680	735200	But I don't think they're going to be that different.
735200	736720	I firmly disagree.
736720	737280	Really?
737280	738000	100%.
738000	740480	Long, long-term viewers of our channels will know
740480	744000	that I can taste-test the difference between Diet Coke
744000	747440	from can to bottle to fountain to glass.
747440	749520	Like, it's very easy for me to...
749520	751200	Even from different restaurant franchises,
751200	752560	I can tell you different Diet Cokes.
752560	753760	I'm an addict.
753760	756080	I wouldn't be surprised if this taste is vastly different.
756080	758800	So, without any further ado, let's crack these guys open, shall we?
760000	761200	You want me to...
761200	762800	This isn't a twist-off.
762800	763600	Do we have a can up here?
763600	764640	Do we have a can up here?
764640	765440	Here, let's go for it.
765440	766240	A bottle opener or something?
767280	771520	You just did it with your teeth.
771520	772320	Sure.
772320	773360	Just a talent.
773360	775280	Okay. Pleasant.
775280	775760	Sprite.
775760	776400	Tastes like Sprite.
776400	777680	It tastes like Sprite.
777680	779760	It's not as carbonated,
779760	782160	but this is a good baseline of Sprite,
782160	783760	not as carbonated as I expected,
783760	785920	but also doesn't have that spiciness that you associate with Sprite.
785920	786880	It's well-balanced.
786880	788400	Yeah, it's actually very smooth.
788400	788800	It is.
788800	790080	It's a smooth Sprite.
790080	790960	All right, here's the big boy.
794320	794800	Huh.
795520	797120	I don't know what to do with that.
797120	797760	I don't either.
800240	801360	This feels flatter.
801360	803040	It feels fizzier, this one does.
803040	804480	Right, that one feels fizzier.
804480	806640	I don't know if the fizz has a flavor,
806640	808320	but it does change.
808320	812080	The fizz is what really feels like it gives you that crispiness,
812080	814720	or the little bit of the Sprite burn.
814720	817360	And it does feel like when this one goes through this straw,
818080	819280	this one feels bubblier.
819280	819760	It does.
819760	820880	Whereas this guy does not.
822080	822960	No trouble with that one.
822960	824320	Right, thanks.
824400	827360	Thank you, but should I enlist your teeth for this one?
828960	829600	Huh.
829600	832240	Okay, that one has less flavor to me.
832240	833200	I agree with that.
833200	835040	It doesn't have much to do with the carbonation,
835040	836800	but it does feel less sweet.
836800	837920	You're trying this one again?
837920	840960	Well, maybe they're not as different as I thought.
840960	843680	So Sprite all really tastes the same.
843680	844080	Yeah.
844080	845280	It's very similar.
845280	847360	There's differences in carbonation,
847360	850480	but I feel like the taste is consistent.
850480	853280	It does feel like the taste is consistent across the board.
853280	856160	It is purely based off of carbonation,
856160	858400	and less to do with the flavor mix.
858400	861040	The more carbonation it feels like the less sweet it is,
861040	862720	whereas like this is more carb,
862720	864320	that's the flattest one so far.
864320	866640	The other ones have like an airy feel.
867200	870640	We did an episode a long time ago about champagne,
870640	872880	and about how the glass bottles of the champagne
872880	874320	and why you pour it into glass,
874320	876880	because it's able to retain the smaller bubbles better.
876880	877200	Oh.
877200	881200	And so I'm wondering if the glass bottle of the Sprite
881280	883280	is actually playing into that in some way,
883280	884720	and it's functioning in some way.
884720	885280	That was nice.
886160	888080	I was able to do that one too, sorry.
888080	890000	I should have offered it to your teeth first, my bad.
892720	894080	This is so vastly different.
895520	897040	There's a lot of bubbles happening.
897040	899680	Those are close with the bubbles.
899680	900640	In terms of the teeny bubbles?
901280	903280	Tiny bubbles.
903280	906400	But it almost feels like this one has the most flavor.
906400	907440	This is so bubbly.
907440	909840	It because the other ones are just so carbonated.
909840	911040	I feel like it's distracting.
911280	912880	So what have we learned here?
912880	915280	What is the most different Sprite?
915280	917760	They all, to me, taste the same.
917760	918240	Yes.
918240	920960	This one, I get a little bit of a sense of the can.
921600	924560	This one tastes a bit watery because of the ice.
924560	927680	This one is very bubbly through a straw
927680	928880	relative to the other ones.
928880	931040	But as far as the flavor difference?
932160	932880	Not a ton.
932880	933760	And I'm surprised.
933760	935680	My hypothesis, like I said at the beginning of the thing,
935680	937680	my hypothesis was that it would be very easy
937680	940080	to tell a flavor difference between all four of these
940080	942080	in much the same way that you do with Diet Coke.
942080	945120	I sit here and I think I'm completely wrong about that.
945120	945440	All right.
945440	947600	So with round one of the tests complete,
947600	950080	I think let's move on to the big boy straws.
950080	954320	So this is what McDonald's is primed to give you, right?
954320	954880	You already do that?
958480	959680	Yours is better than mine.
960240	961040	I have a four-year-old.
961040	962240	I do it slightly more frequently.
962240	963040	That's valid.
963040	964880	I blew, speaking of my four-year-old,
964880	966880	I blew Ollie's mind one time
966880	968640	by showing him the Giga straw.
968640	969040	There it is.
969040	969920	Why do you call it that?
970160	970880	The Giga straw?
971440	972080	To this more?
976080	976400	Yes.
977280	978160	Because it's more.
978160	980880	Obviously we have a bigger boy straw.
980880	983440	So now it's time to compare the flavor of the two, right?
983440	984880	Does the higher volume of stuff
984880	986480	that you're getting in your mouth through this one
986480	987920	complement this type of sprite?
987920	989360	Does it change things at all?
989360	991280	Does it affect the amount of carbonation
991280	992640	and bubbles that you're tasting?
992640	995200	So without any further ado, back to the rounds.
995200	996640	I might need a Giga straw for this soon.
997680	998640	It's good down there.
998640	1000400	It's easier to drink.
1002400	1003520	It tastes the same.
1004320	1004960	It still tastes like sprite.
1004960	1006000	It tastes the same.
1006000	1009120	Spoiler alert, drinking it through a big straw
1009120	1011840	has not changed the fact that it is still sprite.
1011840	1012320	There you go, Matt.
1012320	1013680	You can open this one.
1013680	1014400	Oh, thanks.
1016800	1017760	Please don't.
1017760	1019040	That old plan.
1019040	1020320	He should need to break it.
1023120	1024960	He gave you a can opener.
1024960	1025280	He did?
1026240	1027360	It's on the air.
1027360	1029040	It's a can opener of defeat.
1029040	1031120	So wait, let's do the side by side real quick.
1031120	1032240	So we got thin straw.
1033600	1035520	Okay, thin straw versus thick boy.
1037840	1038480	Interesting.
1038480	1039440	We do it side by side.
1040320	1042160	The bubbles don't come through quite as much.
1042160	1042320	Right.
1042320	1043120	It's a little bit easier.
1043120	1044480	Yeah, it's interesting.
1044480	1047440	Because the straw has texture on the inside,
1047440	1048400	the soda's coming through it,
1048400	1050560	so it's activating a lot of those bubbles, right?
1050560	1053120	Here, because you're getting more fluid
1053120	1054560	and less surface area,
1054560	1056320	you're going to get less bubbles overall.
1056320	1057920	And that's exactly what I'm tasting here.
1057920	1059520	This one, the smaller straw,
1059520	1062720	is giving me stuff that is decidedly more bubbly
1062720	1064240	and concentrated in the bubbles.
1064240	1067120	This is a much more balanced flavor for this guy.
1067120	1068560	This is a moment of truth.
1068560	1068800	Huh.
1070080	1070640	Interesting.
1070640	1070800	What is that?
1070800	1072240	I'm curious to get your opinion.
1072240	1073440	I don't want to color any judgment.
1073440	1074240	To me, it's the same.
1074240	1074560	Really?
1074560	1075040	Yeah.
1075040	1075520	Interesting.
1075520	1075760	Here.
1075760	1076560	Stir it again.
1076560	1077760	I think for some reason,
1077760	1080240	you almost lose the carbonation with the small straw
1080240	1082160	and it comes back more with the big one.
1082160	1083440	I don't think it's there quite as much
1083440	1084960	as the other ones still,
1084960	1087760	but it is more balanced, for sure.
1087760	1090720	Maybe I'm just consuming my drinks like a maniac.
1091760	1093120	It's sicko mode.
1093120	1094960	Like, oh, I'm drinking the whole thing.
1094960	1096960	And it's not giving me much of a flavor difference,
1097680	1099200	but it's giving me like...
1099200	1100160	To mouth feel.
1100160	1103200	Yeah, it's a weird mouth feel thing, right?
1103200	1107520	Where having more fluid hitting my mouth faster
1107520	1110320	is more satisfying in some way.
1110320	1112000	When I'm drinking this,
1112080	1113520	I find it much more enjoyable
1113520	1115360	going through this straw than this straw.
1115360	1117840	I think it's just a whole experience.
1118480	1120160	Not 100% sure what it is,
1120160	1121920	but with both of the two,
1121920	1123920	I would opt for the bigger straw.
1123920	1125680	Even though I couldn't necessarily tell you
1125680	1127600	why I'm opting for the bigger straw,
1127600	1129280	I like it better.
1129280	1129920	For the vibes.
1130480	1131280	For the vibes.
1131280	1131600	Yeah.
1131600	1132240	For the vibes.
1132960	1133680	Same thing.
1133680	1136080	These straws are just too small.
1136080	1138400	They create too much carbonation.
1138400	1139440	And as a result,
1139440	1142480	I don't get the flavor of the soda
1142480	1144160	as much as just a bunch of bubbles
1144160	1145520	and I don't like that much carbonation.
1145520	1147680	That's significantly different.
1147680	1148480	Carbonation.
1148480	1149280	Yeah, between the two.
1149280	1150960	Yeah, the flavor stays the same.
1150960	1151840	Through all of them, I think.
1151840	1154320	But the carbonation affects the flavor.
1154320	1154880	It does.
1154880	1157200	100% cross the board in every single one of these.
1157200	1159120	Big straw is the better option.
1159120	1162400	The flavor is better with less carbonation.
1162400	1166320	So maybe McDonald's' secret sauce here
1166320	1168080	isn't so much about like
1168080	1170240	the flavor or anything like that.
1170240	1172640	It really boils down to the straw.
1173360	1174480	But what's interesting, right,
1175360	1176720	is as we continue to drink this,
1176720	1179440	as I get overwhelmed with the flavor of Sprite,
1179440	1182640	I appreciate the watered-down,
1182640	1184640	icy, you know, this is the guy
1184640	1186960	that has the watered-down Sprite flavor.
1186960	1190320	Whereas the other ones are just pure and unconcentrated.
1190320	1191680	And so, like you said,
1191680	1194320	this one tastes slightly different
1194320	1195120	as a result of that.
1195120	1196800	It tastes more mild.
1196800	1198240	It's more soothing.
1198240	1200560	And so, like, I feel like I can drink more of this.
1200560	1202000	And this one at this point
1202000	1203600	is like my favorite of these.
1203600	1204000	Yeah.
1204000	1207760	Because it's not just cloying the entire time.
1207760	1209840	Yeah, it does feel more refreshing.
1209840	1210560	I feel like that's...
1210560	1212320	If I had to drink all of one of these,
1212320	1212960	that one's bigger.
1212960	1213920	So I don't know if that's fair.
1213920	1215200	But I would drink more of that one.
1215200	1218240	Yeah, it's mellower now at this point.
1218240	1219760	Again, because of the ice.
1219760	1222320	But as a result, I actually like it better.
1222320	1224640	So maybe what the conclusion here
1224720	1229200	is that normal Sprite is just too strong of a soda.
1229200	1231440	And they just need to chill it out a little bit.
1231440	1232160	Maybe.
1232160	1234240	I mean, there's just a lot going on
1234240	1236960	with flavor and carbonation in all of these.
1236960	1240960	And that takes a little bit of it away, which is nice.
1240960	1242480	Which brings us to the final variable,
1243360	1244480	which is the fries.
1244480	1245280	The French fries.
1245280	1245600	Right?
1245600	1246880	So now the question is,
1246880	1249520	will the Sprite from McDonald's
1249520	1251520	be specifically engineered
1251520	1252880	to complement the flavor
1252880	1254480	and the saltiness of the McDonald's, right?
1254560	1257120	Because we've ultimately decided that the syrup
1257120	1258640	tastes largely the same,
1258640	1260560	I don't think that's going to be the case.
1260560	1263360	I'm not super hopeful on this one, to be honest with you.
1263360	1266000	This is better with fries than the bottle.
1266000	1266480	I agree.
1267200	1269040	Maybe just the sweetness of it.
1269040	1271440	Oh, I don't like the fries with the bottle.
1271440	1273040	This just feels right.
1273040	1273600	Right?
1273600	1274160	What is it?
1274160	1274880	It's sweeter.
1274880	1276000	I almost think the opposite.
1276000	1276560	Really?
1276560	1279120	Where I think these two that I just tried
1279120	1281760	are so sweet and so flavored.
1282320	1283280	Whereas this one, again,
1283280	1284480	has a little bit of that wateriness to it,
1284480	1286880	which balances, like, it's mellower
1286880	1288240	and a little bit waterier,
1288240	1289680	which balances out against the, like,
1289680	1291280	salty greasiness of the fry.
1291280	1293200	If you were to ask me which one I would want,
1293200	1295360	just, like, by natural impulse,
1295360	1297200	which one are you drinking with these fries?
1299280	1299840	Hands down.
1299840	1300560	Hands down.
1300560	1301200	Hands down.
1301200	1301840	Hands down.
1301840	1302320	Right?
1302320	1305040	And again, is it a flavor difference?
1305840	1306080	No.
1307280	1308640	It is more refreshing.
1308640	1309520	It is.
1309520	1312160	And it's got to be a mix of, like,
1312240	1314400	water and carbonation,
1314400	1316240	and it's refreshing.
1316240	1318160	I feel like it's probably a combination
1318160	1320240	of everything that we've talked about today, right?
1320240	1323280	There is an element of the ice
1323280	1324320	that's mixed into this,
1324320	1326080	which makes it slightly more refreshing.
1326080	1327920	There is an element of the straw,
1327920	1329360	which makes it more consumable.
1329360	1330800	And then, yeah, as I keep going back
1330800	1332240	to the other sprites,
1332240	1335280	all the other sprites have just that,
1335280	1336880	again, like, such a strong flavor
1336880	1337760	as opposed to this guy,
1337760	1340880	which is different in a good way.
1340880	1341440	Yeah.
1341440	1342240	Top tier.
1342240	1343040	Top tier.
1343040	1343360	Why?
1343360	1344000	I don't know.
1344000	1345120	Yeah, yeah.
1345120	1347920	It's top tier and not in a way
1347920	1349680	that you can clearly articulate,
1349680	1350880	but is better.
1350880	1351440	Yeah.
1351440	1352480	So there you have it.
1352480	1353680	After rigorous testing
1353680	1355360	and absolutely attacking our stomachs
1355360	1356000	with sugar,
1356000	1357440	we found that McDonald's sprite
1357440	1359200	does indeed hit different,
1359200	1360960	but not for the reasons you might expect.
1360960	1363040	To start, the carbonation was actually
1363040	1365040	less in the McDonald's sprite than the others.
1365040	1366560	We didn't really feel that snap,
1366560	1367840	crackle, or pop,
1367840	1368480	but you know what?
1368480	1369040	It worked.
1369040	1370560	And we're not the only ones to think so.
1370560	1373200	This one kind of tasted too fizzy for me.
1373200	1375280	I actually kind of like these better than that one.
1375280	1376480	The lack of carbonation there
1376480	1378320	was a real surprise considering the science
1378320	1379840	behind the McDonald's process.
1379840	1381040	The cold filtered water
1381040	1382640	should have allowed for more carbonation,
1382640	1383840	but the ice and the rate at which
1383840	1385120	the plastic cup heated up
1385120	1386480	might have affected the fizziness.
1386480	1388320	We also found that the flavor was milder
1388320	1389520	and a little bit sweeter.
1389520	1391200	Ultimately, it amounted to an overall
1391200	1392720	more pleasant experience,
1392720	1394000	and was the drink that we agreed
1394000	1396000	would be the one that we'd keep coming back to.
1396000	1396720	But in the end,
1396720	1398880	the one variable that made the biggest difference
1398880	1400400	across all the taste tests
1400560	1401840	is the bigger straw.
1401840	1403360	The fact that, I gotta be honest,
1403360	1405200	was absolutely shocking to me.
1405200	1407040	The wider straw made the perfect balance
1407040	1408240	so you got enough fluid
1408240	1409440	so you could taste the flavors,
1409440	1412320	but also adding in just the right amount of bubbles.
1412320	1413600	And even though Rachel and I
1413600	1414800	didn't quite see eye to eye
1414800	1416000	on what made the fountain sprite
1416000	1417600	our favorite to partner with the fries,
1417600	1418960	it was in a different league
1418960	1419920	than any of the others
1419920	1421840	in terms of how refreshing it was to drink
1421840	1422720	and how well it worked
1422720	1424560	with all that salty greasiness.
1424560	1425120	In the end,
1425120	1426720	the secret to McDonald's sprite
1426720	1427920	wasn't a matter of taste,
1427920	1429200	which makes sense considering
1429200	1430560	there's nothing special about the syrup
1430560	1431760	that McDonald's is using
1431760	1433120	nor the container they keep it in.
1433120	1433600	Instead,
1433600	1435120	it was a matter of how pleasant
1435120	1437600	the entire drink experience ended up being.
1437600	1439200	It's a finely tuned process
1439200	1441040	that takes into account everything
1441040	1441920	from temperature,
1441920	1442720	the amount of ice,
1442720	1443920	to straw your sipping through,
1443920	1445280	the dishes that you're enjoying
1445280	1446240	alongside the drink,
1446240	1447520	all of those things combined
1447520	1449840	to make McDonald's sprite truly special.
1449840	1450240	And sure,
1450240	1451920	it didn't quite make me feel like static,
1451920	1452880	a lightning or the meteor
1452880	1454160	that killed the dinosaurs,
1454160	1455520	but we obeyed our thirst,
1455520	1456720	and I was quenched.
1456800	1457920	It'll quench ya.
1457920	1459840	Nothing's quenched here.
1459840	1461280	It's the quenched here.
1461280	1462240	But hey,
1462240	1464000	that's just a theory.
1464000	1466000	A food theory.
1466000	1467280	Bottoms up.
