00:00.000 --> 00:04.800
Everyone knows that McDonald's Sprite tastes way better than just ordinary Sprite. Why is it so good?

00:04.800 --> 00:07.520
What is the secret to McDonald's soda fountains?

00:07.520 --> 00:11.200
It's a great question that's been circulating around the internet for the last five years,

00:11.200 --> 00:13.600
and that is what I aimed to answer today.

00:13.600 --> 00:17.440
And let me tell you, the truth is in the place that you'd least suspect it.

00:19.360 --> 00:24.400
Hello internet! Welcome to Food Theory, the channel that hits different.

00:24.400 --> 00:29.040
For a while now, the internet's been obsessed with a fizzy mystery that is McDonald's Sprite.

00:29.040 --> 00:34.000
In case you've never had it, it's like perfectly chilled liquid pop rocks bursting with lemon lime flavor.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.120
The general consensus is that the Sprite being served out of McDonald's soda fountain is stronger,

00:39.120 --> 00:42.000
giving it an electric, or even a spicy, taste.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.440
Why is it spicy?

00:43.440 --> 00:45.040
You need to order a Sprite?

00:45.040 --> 00:46.240
Extra spicy.

00:46.240 --> 00:47.360
Extra spicy?

00:47.360 --> 00:48.960
Whoa, it's spicy!

00:48.960 --> 00:52.800
Others have said that this stuff is so powerful it could probably fry fish.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.240
I'm at the price of fish, you want some?

00:54.240 --> 00:55.520
Yeah, but we don't have a place.

00:55.520 --> 00:56.640
I got something stronger, man.

00:57.440 --> 00:58.560
Ah!

00:58.560 --> 01:03.840
My personal favorite flavor comparison, though, is that it tastes like what a Super Saiyan 2 looks like.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.360
Crisp and full of lightning.

01:05.360 --> 01:10.080
It's even gotten to the point where McDonald's and Sprite themselves have had to acknowledge this trend.

01:10.080 --> 01:13.200
Hey everybody, Chris K here. I'm in the mood for some spice.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.880
First, the spicy Sprite.

01:15.680 --> 01:16.480
That's spicy.

01:16.480 --> 01:19.200
But obviously, the next question that everyone has on their mind is,

01:19.200 --> 01:21.280
what exactly makes the drink so explosive?

01:21.280 --> 01:22.560
So good, so crisp.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.720
Well, the internet has plenty of theories.

01:24.800 --> 01:28.240
Food theories, trying to answer exactly that.

01:28.240 --> 01:32.560
In general, the guesses circulating the internet boil down to four key factors.

01:32.560 --> 01:37.040
The first is that the Sprite syrup getting shipped to the restaurants gets special treatment due to a

01:37.040 --> 01:39.520
long-standing partnership between Coke and McDonald's.

01:39.520 --> 01:43.440
Coke sends syrup in plastic bags to other restaurants and stores.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.640
They send the syrup to McDonald's in stainless steel containers.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.160
The second theory is that the carbonation levels are just higher at McDonald's.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.720
So you get more carbonation, that's why it burns your nose.

01:52.720 --> 01:57.680
Third is that the Sprite is extra sweet to better combat the saltiness of McDonald's fries.

01:57.680 --> 02:03.440
McDonald's hired a sensory scientist and he found out that the salt that they use in their fries

02:03.440 --> 02:05.920
enhances the flavor of the Sprite.

02:05.920 --> 02:10.080
And finally, some have thrown all of that other stuff away and said that there's no difference,

02:10.080 --> 02:14.080
but rather everything's the result of McDonald's having a larger straw.

02:14.080 --> 02:17.280
Apparently, the straw is bigger, so you get more flavor in your mouth.

02:17.280 --> 02:20.080
Okay, this one's definitely for who even rides this.

02:20.080 --> 02:24.080
So today we're putting this debate to rest once and for all by digging into the facts

02:24.080 --> 02:26.640
and then running our own battery of scientific tests.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.440
Why is McDonald's Sprite so different?

02:29.440 --> 02:30.160
Is it different?

02:30.160 --> 02:34.000
Or is this just a self-fulfilling prophecy started by the internet hype machine

02:34.000 --> 02:36.320
that now everyone just implicitly believes?

02:36.320 --> 02:37.600
Get ready, theorists.

02:37.600 --> 02:41.040
Today we obey our thirst, but follow the facts.

02:41.040 --> 02:44.800
Now, before we get to my big taste experiment, putting all these theories to the test,

02:44.800 --> 02:47.680
I think it makes sense to look at the possible explanations one at a time

02:47.680 --> 02:50.080
to see if there's anything we can debunk right off the bat.

02:50.080 --> 02:53.600
The first hypothesis that I've seen circulating around is that Coca-Cola

02:53.600 --> 02:57.360
especially delivers the Sprite syrup to McDonald's restaurant in these large,

02:57.360 --> 02:58.640
stainless steel tanks.

02:58.640 --> 03:01.840
This is the result of a long-standing relationship between the two companies.

03:01.840 --> 03:05.600
And right off the bat, this one does seem to be rooted in some amount of truth.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.960
You see, the relationship between Coke and McDonald's started in the early days of the

03:08.960 --> 03:13.280
restaurant's expansion, with the two companies partnering up and largely growing together.

03:13.280 --> 03:17.920
Their relationship is so strong that Coke is contractually barred from selling syrup to

03:17.920 --> 03:22.480
other restaurants for less than what McDonald's pays, even if it means costing them business.

03:22.480 --> 03:27.920
There's even a division at Coca-Cola dedicated to specifically McDonald's business, aptly named

03:27.920 --> 03:29.040
the McDonald's division.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.920
Look, they're saving the creativity for the marketing and not the department naming.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.440
Needless to say, Coke works closely with McDonald's to make sure that they have

03:35.440 --> 03:38.320
everything they need to deliver their product in the best way possible.

03:38.320 --> 03:41.520
And in turn, McDonald's spends a large amount of resources to ensure that they're

03:41.520 --> 03:44.400
given their customers the best Coca-Cola experience they can.

03:44.400 --> 03:48.320
But does any of this actually affect the way that syrup is being shipped?

03:48.320 --> 03:49.200
Yes, it does.

03:49.200 --> 03:52.960
You see, the concept of delivering the syrup in stainless steel vats makes a lot of sense.

03:52.960 --> 03:56.320
The steel helps ensure that the syrup's flavor is the purist it can be.

03:56.320 --> 04:00.160
And when you look at the reality of the situation, Coke is indeed sending

04:00.160 --> 04:02.160
syrups to McDonald's and steel vats.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.200
There's just one problem.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.040
It's not Sprite syrup.

04:05.040 --> 04:08.000
According to James McIntyre, a franchise owner from Pennsylvania,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.320
not all Coke products get the same treatment.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.600
Dessert for Coca-Cola?

04:11.600 --> 04:13.520
That arrives in stainless steel tanks.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.680
The Sprite, however, does not.

04:15.680 --> 04:19.280
It instead comes in the standard plastic bags that everyone else is using.

04:19.280 --> 04:21.600
That's right, it's just a box lined with a plastic bag.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.720
We even went to our local McDonald's and asked to speak to the manager,

04:24.720 --> 04:28.480
in the least caring way possible, to see if we could get confirmation of any of this.

04:28.480 --> 04:33.200
And yep, only Coca-Cola gets the stainless steel vat treatment, not Sprite.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.680
So that's one major theory debunked right off the bat.

04:35.680 --> 04:39.040
Next up, the water quality and overall level of carbonation.

04:39.040 --> 04:42.960
As hype around McDonald's soda is circulated across the internet for the past five years,

04:42.960 --> 04:48.000
various sources have started to come clean about how clean McDonald's soda fountains really are.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.160
And it's here that our friend James McIntyre,

04:50.160 --> 04:52.960
that franchise owner from Pennsylvania I talked about in the last paragraph,

04:52.960 --> 04:56.160
helps us out again, revealing that McDonald's has not one,

04:56.160 --> 05:00.160
but four different water filtration systems that the water has to go through

05:00.160 --> 05:02.240
before it ever makes it to the soda tower.

05:02.240 --> 05:05.520
This process includes a state-of-the-art reverse osmosis filter

05:05.520 --> 05:08.160
that works by applying pressure to the unfiltered water,

05:08.160 --> 05:10.640
forcing it through a membrane and into a storage tank,

05:10.640 --> 05:14.080
which in turn helps remove dissolved minerals, bacteria, and other solids.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.680
This makes the water virtually tasteless before the syrup gets mixed in,

05:17.680 --> 05:21.760
thereby ensuring a consistent flavor profile wherever you're going in the country.

05:21.760 --> 05:24.560
Usually a restaurant or a gas station that has itself a soda fountain

05:24.560 --> 05:27.040
is gonna connect the water line directly to the machine.

05:27.040 --> 05:29.760
Rarely are they incorporating a filter, let alone four.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.680
This makes the process simpler and cheaper,

05:31.680 --> 05:34.320
but apparently McDonald's isn't afraid to spend a little bit more.

05:34.320 --> 05:35.840
But it's not all about purity.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.840
Once the water is squeaky, clean, and tasteless,

05:37.840 --> 05:40.800
the next step in the process is for them to make it sub-zero.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.240
Uh, alright, not exactly sub-zero, but just really, really cold.

05:44.240 --> 05:47.920
See, the other big difference is the temperature that McDonald's keeps everything at.

05:47.920 --> 05:52.000
Normally other soda fountains are set to flash-chill their sodas as they're being dispensed,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.240
so that they come out cold, but not cold-cold.

05:54.240 --> 05:58.000
The golden arches on the other hand are pre-chilling not only the filtered water,

05:58.000 --> 06:02.880
but also the syrup to the perfect range between 33 and 38 degrees Fahrenheit,

06:02.880 --> 06:04.720
just above freezing temperatures.

06:04.720 --> 06:09.360
This range is important because it's the optimal temperatures for the carbonation of the water.

06:09.360 --> 06:13.520
You see, CO2, or carbon dioxide, the chemical compound that makes fizzy drinks,

06:13.520 --> 06:17.520
fizz, has a higher rate of absorption and dispersion in colder liquids.

06:17.520 --> 06:21.280
In other words, the colder the liquid is, the more carbonation it's able to have.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.840
This is why warm drinks tend to go flat quicker.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.680
The gas is able to escape more easily.

06:25.680 --> 06:29.280
So with the sprite's water and syrup both being pre-chilled,

06:29.280 --> 06:31.920
it's preventing any unwanted fluctuations in temperature

06:31.920 --> 06:34.640
when the water and syrup get mixed together in the soda fountain.

06:34.640 --> 06:38.880
In other words, the claim that McDonald's sprite is more carbonated is technically true,

06:38.880 --> 06:40.960
but not for the reasons that you would expect.

06:40.960 --> 06:44.560
It appears like it has more to do with the colder temperatures of the water and syrup

06:44.560 --> 06:49.600
rather than any sort of artificial increase in the amount of actual bubbles being shoved into the mix.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.680
But then, what about the syrup-to-water ratio?

06:51.680 --> 06:54.160
One of the biggest myths that you see circulating around the internet

06:54.160 --> 06:56.960
is that the syrup-to-water ratio coming out of McDonald's fountains

06:56.960 --> 07:01.120
is actually higher than what's being served up in a typical bottle or can of sprite,

07:01.120 --> 07:05.760
thereby making their soda sweeter and thus more flavorful or stronger to the drinkers.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.040
This is one, though, that McDonald's themselves have publicly shut down,

07:09.040 --> 07:11.440
saying that there's no special formula they have.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.920
That said, I'm not just gonna naturally trust a corporation.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.120
Can we take their word for it?

07:15.120 --> 07:18.080
The answer is actually somewhere between yes and no,

07:18.080 --> 07:21.280
while McDonald's claims to strictly adhere to the Coca-Cola standard

07:21.280 --> 07:25.920
of one-to-five water-sirrup ratio or one ounce of syrup to every five ounces of water,

07:25.920 --> 07:29.760
they do take into consideration the ice that's being added into the drink,

07:29.760 --> 07:32.240
meaning that they have a slightly higher syrup content,

07:32.240 --> 07:34.240
but it's done so that once ice is added,

07:34.240 --> 07:37.280
you're tasting the equivalent of the standard one-to-five ratio.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.880
So, pro tip to all of you watching,

07:38.880 --> 07:41.360
don't skip the ice the next time you drink at McDonald's.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.920
You're gonna ruin the ratio, you'll ruin the art,

07:43.920 --> 07:45.760
and it'll just be a tad bit too sweet.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.000
So we've gotten our cup of sprite straight out of the fountain,

07:48.000 --> 07:50.560
nice and cold with just the right amount of ice and flavor,

07:50.560 --> 07:53.280
but there's still something else at work here, the fries.

07:53.280 --> 07:56.640
Rumor number three states that McDonald's hired sensory scientists

07:56.640 --> 08:00.320
to help optimize how the sweet sprite pairs with the salty fries,

08:00.320 --> 08:02.640
all in order to make the perfect combination.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.120
And anecdotally, there's evidence to back this one up.

08:05.120 --> 08:08.960
According to some sources, McDonald's has developed a special ketchup recipe,

08:08.960 --> 08:11.520
one that's sweeter and tangier than other brands

08:11.520 --> 08:15.120
that is specifically designed to match the saltier flavor of their fries.

08:15.120 --> 08:18.000
Now, according to my research, this has never been outright confirmed,

08:18.000 --> 08:21.040
but it is known that the company uses extensive taste testing

08:21.040 --> 08:23.520
to ensure that their products are as delicious as possible,

08:23.520 --> 08:24.800
and if they're doing it with ketchup,

08:24.800 --> 08:27.840
is it that much of a stretch to believe that they're doing it with the sodas as well?

08:27.840 --> 08:28.560
But that's not all.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.720
Back in the ancient days of the 1980s,

08:30.720 --> 08:32.960
when cars were powered by feet like the Flintstones,

08:32.960 --> 08:35.760
the French fries at McDonald's were fried using beef tallow

08:35.760 --> 08:37.920
instead of the canola oil that they use today.

08:37.920 --> 08:41.120
This made for an insanely rich, savory fry taste.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.000
Unfortunately, beef tallow is also incredibly unhealthy.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
So in the 90s, when the public grew more concerned

08:46.000 --> 08:47.680
about the saturated fats in their foods,

08:47.680 --> 08:50.080
they made the switch to plain old vegetable oil.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.160
Customers obviously started to complain,

08:52.160 --> 08:56.640
so McDonald's began adding natural beef flavorings to mimic the old beloved flavor.

08:56.640 --> 09:00.080
Yep, that means that the fries at McDonald's are not vegan-friendly,

09:00.080 --> 09:02.160
so uh, sorry any of you vegans out there

09:02.160 --> 09:04.800
that have been happily munching down on the golden goodness.

09:04.800 --> 09:09.360
But hey, at least they did have to pay $10 million as part of a lawsuit because of that very fact.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.560
Anyway, today their French fries still contain that rich umami flavor

09:12.560 --> 09:14.320
from the added beef flavoring and salt.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.960
Couple that with the refreshing acidity and sweetness of the sprite,

09:16.960 --> 09:18.960
and you have yourself the bliss point.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.520
A term coined by market researcher Howard Moskowitz

09:21.520 --> 09:24.720
when describing the perfect balance of sugar, salt, and fat.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.160
These two complete each other like a fast food rom-com come to life,

09:28.160 --> 09:31.200
but none of it is gonna matter if you're just guzzling the sprite like an animal.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.480
And this, my friends, is where one of the smallest parts of this process

09:34.480 --> 09:37.200
makes itself the biggest difference, the straw.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.680
Hypothesis number four, the size of the straw.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.360
Most people don't give the straw a second thought,

09:41.360 --> 09:44.240
but McDonald's gave it a second, third, and fourth thought.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.600
For example, did you know that McDonald's straws are actually wider than normal?

09:47.600 --> 09:50.960
Yeah, the diameter of a standard drinking straw is 0.24 inches,

09:50.960 --> 09:55.440
but a McDonald's straw has a diameter of 0.284 inches.

09:55.440 --> 09:56.800
Now, that might not sound like that much,

09:56.800 --> 10:01.440
but it's enough of a difference that a normal straw can actually fit inside of a McDonald's one.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.680
And just how much of that is changing the drink experience?

10:03.680 --> 10:07.520
Well, the advantage of drinking through a straw is that it delivers less liquid into your mouth,

10:07.520 --> 10:10.560
allowing you to warm it up faster and get more aroma and flavor

10:10.560 --> 10:14.240
through volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, for short.

10:14.240 --> 10:17.200
VOCs help produce aromas of the food and drinks that we consume,

10:17.200 --> 10:20.880
aromas that are intensified and become more complex when they warm up.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.760
That's why if you were to just take a giant swig of freezing sprite,

10:23.760 --> 10:27.440
you'd barely be able to taste much outside of the brain freeze that's ravaging your head.

10:27.440 --> 10:31.120
But with a straw, it limits the amount of liquid that you can take into your mouth at a time,

10:31.120 --> 10:36.080
which lets it warm up briefly and at the same time improves air circulation in the mouth when you drink.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.320
The straw is also helping out with the carbonation because,

10:38.320 --> 10:40.080
while a straw might seem smooth to us,

10:40.080 --> 10:43.520
there are actually tons of tiny little bumps and indentations in there,

10:43.520 --> 10:46.400
all places where carbon dioxide molecules can attach to,

10:46.400 --> 10:49.360
thereby creating more bubbles, promoting more effervescence.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.720
This is why paper straws, which have even more imperfections,

10:52.720 --> 10:55.040
can cause carbonated drinks to go crazy.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.760
Or at least that's how the science should play out.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.640
But does any of this actually make that substantial of a difference?

11:00.640 --> 11:03.600
It's finally time to put all these variables to the test.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.360
Take it away, live-action MatPat.

11:05.360 --> 11:08.720
Alright, so with all our variables set and ready to go,

11:08.720 --> 11:11.840
it's time to actually put our money where our mouth is.

11:11.840 --> 11:14.480
Or put our sprite where our mouth is.

11:14.480 --> 11:18.720
I am joined on the couch by HR representative Rachel.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.960
Hello, happy to be here.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.960
Is that the lore that I should build for you at this point?

11:22.960 --> 11:24.880
That's sure. That sounds fancier than I am.

11:26.560 --> 11:30.240
So before you, we have a bunch of different varieties of sprite,

11:30.240 --> 11:33.280
so we can actually get a side-by-side taste test

11:33.280 --> 11:36.240
on what truly is the best version of sprite.

11:36.240 --> 11:39.680
We also have variables of different straw sizes,

11:39.680 --> 11:42.960
so we can see if straw size is playing a factor in all of this.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.760
And then lastly, we have the fries.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.440
Right over here, it's lunchtime, which is great.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.880
We have some fries, so we can test out whether this sprite

11:50.880 --> 11:54.160
is specifically engineered to complement the saltiness

11:54.160 --> 11:56.720
of the McDonald's fry, or if that's just a myth

11:56.720 --> 11:58.000
and they're all equally the same.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.760
So, how do you feel about sprite?

11:59.760 --> 12:03.120
I love sprite, and I expect them all to taste the same,

12:03.120 --> 12:04.000
but I'm going to enjoy them all.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.280
Yeah, you think they're all going to taste the same?

12:05.280 --> 12:09.360
Well, I think with the fries, I think we're going to like that one.

12:09.360 --> 12:10.240
For the vibes.

12:10.240 --> 12:11.280
Really, for the vibes.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.680
Purely vibes. Purely off of vibes.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.200
But I don't think they're going to be that different.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.720
I firmly disagree.

12:16.720 --> 12:17.280
Really?

12:17.280 --> 12:18.000
100%.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.480
Long, long-term viewers of our channels will know

12:20.480 --> 12:24.000
that I can taste-test the difference between Diet Coke

12:24.000 --> 12:27.440
from can to bottle to fountain to glass.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.520
Like, it's very easy for me to...

12:29.520 --> 12:31.200
Even from different restaurant franchises,

12:31.200 --> 12:32.560
I can tell you different Diet Cokes.

12:32.560 --> 12:33.760
I'm an addict.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.080
I wouldn't be surprised if this taste is vastly different.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.800
So, without any further ado, let's crack these guys open, shall we?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.200
You want me to...

12:41.200 --> 12:42.800
This isn't a twist-off.

12:42.800 --> 12:43.600
Do we have a can up here?

12:43.600 --> 12:44.640
Do we have a can up here?

12:44.640 --> 12:45.440
Here, let's go for it.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.240
A bottle opener or something?

12:47.280 --> 12:51.520
You just did it with your teeth.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.320
Sure.

12:52.320 --> 12:53.360
Just a talent.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.280
Okay. Pleasant.

12:55.280 --> 12:55.760
Sprite.

12:55.760 --> 12:56.400
Tastes like Sprite.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.680
It tastes like Sprite.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.760
It's not as carbonated,

12:59.760 --> 13:02.160
but this is a good baseline of Sprite,

13:02.160 --> 13:03.760
not as carbonated as I expected,

13:03.760 --> 13:05.920
but also doesn't have that spiciness that you associate with Sprite.

13:05.920 --> 13:06.880
It's well-balanced.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.400
Yeah, it's actually very smooth.

13:08.400 --> 13:08.800
It is.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.080
It's a smooth Sprite.

13:10.080 --> 13:10.960
All right, here's the big boy.

13:14.320 --> 13:14.800
Huh.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.120
I don't know what to do with that.

13:17.120 --> 13:17.760
I don't either.

13:20.240 --> 13:21.360
This feels flatter.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.040
It feels fizzier, this one does.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.480
Right, that one feels fizzier.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.640
I don't know if the fizz has a flavor,

13:26.640 --> 13:28.320
but it does change.

13:28.320 --> 13:32.080
The fizz is what really feels like it gives you that crispiness,

13:32.080 --> 13:34.720
or the little bit of the Sprite burn.

13:34.720 --> 13:37.360
And it does feel like when this one goes through this straw,

13:38.080 --> 13:39.280
this one feels bubblier.

13:39.280 --> 13:39.760
It does.

13:39.760 --> 13:40.880
Whereas this guy does not.

13:42.080 --> 13:42.960
No trouble with that one.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.320
Right, thanks.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.360
Thank you, but should I enlist your teeth for this one?

13:48.960 --> 13:49.600
Huh.

13:49.600 --> 13:52.240
Okay, that one has less flavor to me.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.200
I agree with that.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.040
It doesn't have much to do with the carbonation,

13:55.040 --> 13:56.800
but it does feel less sweet.

13:56.800 --> 13:57.920
You're trying this one again?

13:57.920 --> 14:00.960
Well, maybe they're not as different as I thought.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.680
So Sprite all really tastes the same.

14:03.680 --> 14:04.080
Yeah.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.280
It's very similar.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.360
There's differences in carbonation,

14:07.360 --> 14:10.480
but I feel like the taste is consistent.

14:10.480 --> 14:13.280
It does feel like the taste is consistent across the board.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.160
It is purely based off of carbonation,

14:16.160 --> 14:18.400
and less to do with the flavor mix.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.040
The more carbonation it feels like the less sweet it is,

14:21.040 --> 14:22.720
whereas like this is more carb,

14:22.720 --> 14:24.320
that's the flattest one so far.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.640
The other ones have like an airy feel.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.640
We did an episode a long time ago about champagne,

14:30.640 --> 14:32.880
and about how the glass bottles of the champagne

14:32.880 --> 14:34.320
and why you pour it into glass,

14:34.320 --> 14:36.880
because it's able to retain the smaller bubbles better.

14:36.880 --> 14:37.200
Oh.

14:37.200 --> 14:41.200
And so I'm wondering if the glass bottle of the Sprite

14:41.280 --> 14:43.280
is actually playing into that in some way,

14:43.280 --> 14:44.720
and it's functioning in some way.

14:44.720 --> 14:45.280
That was nice.

14:46.160 --> 14:48.080
I was able to do that one too, sorry.

14:48.080 --> 14:50.000
I should have offered it to your teeth first, my bad.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.080
This is so vastly different.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.040
There's a lot of bubbles happening.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.680
Those are close with the bubbles.

14:59.680 --> 15:00.640
In terms of the teeny bubbles?

15:01.280 --> 15:03.280
Tiny bubbles.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.400
But it almost feels like this one has the most flavor.

15:06.400 --> 15:07.440
This is so bubbly.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.840
It because the other ones are just so carbonated.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.040
I feel like it's distracting.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.880
So what have we learned here?

15:12.880 --> 15:15.280
What is the most different Sprite?

15:15.280 --> 15:17.760
They all, to me, taste the same.

15:17.760 --> 15:18.240
Yes.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.960
This one, I get a little bit of a sense of the can.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.560
This one tastes a bit watery because of the ice.

15:24.560 --> 15:27.680
This one is very bubbly through a straw

15:27.680 --> 15:28.880
relative to the other ones.

15:28.880 --> 15:31.040
But as far as the flavor difference?

15:32.160 --> 15:32.880
Not a ton.

15:32.880 --> 15:33.760
And I'm surprised.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.680
My hypothesis, like I said at the beginning of the thing,

15:35.680 --> 15:37.680
my hypothesis was that it would be very easy

15:37.680 --> 15:40.080
to tell a flavor difference between all four of these

15:40.080 --> 15:42.080
in much the same way that you do with Diet Coke.

15:42.080 --> 15:45.120
I sit here and I think I'm completely wrong about that.

15:45.120 --> 15:45.440
All right.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.600
So with round one of the tests complete,

15:47.600 --> 15:50.080
I think let's move on to the big boy straws.

15:50.080 --> 15:54.320
So this is what McDonald's is primed to give you, right?

15:54.320 --> 15:54.880
You already do that?

15:58.480 --> 15:59.680
Yours is better than mine.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.040
I have a four-year-old.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.240
I do it slightly more frequently.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.040
That's valid.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.880
I blew, speaking of my four-year-old,

16:04.880 --> 16:06.880
I blew Ollie's mind one time

16:06.880 --> 16:08.640
by showing him the Giga straw.

16:08.640 --> 16:09.040
There it is.

16:09.040 --> 16:09.920
Why do you call it that?

16:10.160 --> 16:10.880
The Giga straw?

16:11.440 --> 16:12.080
To this more?

16:16.080 --> 16:16.400
Yes.

16:17.280 --> 16:18.160
Because it's more.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.880
Obviously we have a bigger boy straw.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.440
So now it's time to compare the flavor of the two, right?

16:23.440 --> 16:24.880
Does the higher volume of stuff

16:24.880 --> 16:26.480
that you're getting in your mouth through this one

16:26.480 --> 16:27.920
complement this type of sprite?

16:27.920 --> 16:29.360
Does it change things at all?

16:29.360 --> 16:31.280
Does it affect the amount of carbonation

16:31.280 --> 16:32.640
and bubbles that you're tasting?

16:32.640 --> 16:35.200
So without any further ado, back to the rounds.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.640
I might need a Giga straw for this soon.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.640
It's good down there.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.400
It's easier to drink.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.520
It tastes the same.

16:44.320 --> 16:44.960
It still tastes like sprite.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.000
It tastes the same.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.120
Spoiler alert, drinking it through a big straw

16:49.120 --> 16:51.840
has not changed the fact that it is still sprite.

16:51.840 --> 16:52.320
There you go, Matt.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.680
You can open this one.

16:53.680 --> 16:54.400
Oh, thanks.

16:56.800 --> 16:57.760
Please don't.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.040
That old plan.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.320
He should need to break it.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.960
He gave you a can opener.

17:04.960 --> 17:05.280
He did?

17:06.240 --> 17:07.360
It's on the air.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.040
It's a can opener of defeat.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.120
So wait, let's do the side by side real quick.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.240
So we got thin straw.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.520
Okay, thin straw versus thick boy.

17:17.840 --> 17:18.480
Interesting.

17:18.480 --> 17:19.440
We do it side by side.

17:20.320 --> 17:22.160
The bubbles don't come through quite as much.

17:22.160 --> 17:22.320
Right.

17:22.320 --> 17:23.120
It's a little bit easier.

17:23.120 --> 17:24.480
Yeah, it's interesting.

17:24.480 --> 17:27.440
Because the straw has texture on the inside,

17:27.440 --> 17:28.400
the soda's coming through it,

17:28.400 --> 17:30.560
so it's activating a lot of those bubbles, right?

17:30.560 --> 17:33.120
Here, because you're getting more fluid

17:33.120 --> 17:34.560
and less surface area,

17:34.560 --> 17:36.320
you're going to get less bubbles overall.

17:36.320 --> 17:37.920
And that's exactly what I'm tasting here.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.520
This one, the smaller straw,

17:39.520 --> 17:42.720
is giving me stuff that is decidedly more bubbly

17:42.720 --> 17:44.240
and concentrated in the bubbles.

17:44.240 --> 17:47.120
This is a much more balanced flavor for this guy.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.560
This is a moment of truth.

17:48.560 --> 17:48.800
Huh.

17:50.080 --> 17:50.640
Interesting.

17:50.640 --> 17:50.800
What is that?

17:50.800 --> 17:52.240
I'm curious to get your opinion.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.440
I don't want to color any judgment.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.240
To me, it's the same.

17:54.240 --> 17:54.560
Really?

17:54.560 --> 17:55.040
Yeah.

17:55.040 --> 17:55.520
Interesting.

17:55.520 --> 17:55.760
Here.

17:55.760 --> 17:56.560
Stir it again.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.760
I think for some reason,

17:57.760 --> 18:00.240
you almost lose the carbonation with the small straw

18:00.240 --> 18:02.160
and it comes back more with the big one.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.440
I don't think it's there quite as much

18:03.440 --> 18:04.960
as the other ones still,

18:04.960 --> 18:07.760
but it is more balanced, for sure.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.720
Maybe I'm just consuming my drinks like a maniac.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.120
It's sicko mode.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.960
Like, oh, I'm drinking the whole thing.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.960
And it's not giving me much of a flavor difference,

18:17.680 --> 18:19.200
but it's giving me like...

18:19.200 --> 18:20.160
To mouth feel.

18:20.160 --> 18:23.200
Yeah, it's a weird mouth feel thing, right?

18:23.200 --> 18:27.520
Where having more fluid hitting my mouth faster

18:27.520 --> 18:30.320
is more satisfying in some way.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.000
When I'm drinking this,

18:32.080 --> 18:33.520
I find it much more enjoyable

18:33.520 --> 18:35.360
going through this straw than this straw.

18:35.360 --> 18:37.840
I think it's just a whole experience.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.160
Not 100% sure what it is,

18:40.160 --> 18:41.920
but with both of the two,

18:41.920 --> 18:43.920
I would opt for the bigger straw.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.680
Even though I couldn't necessarily tell you

18:45.680 --> 18:47.600
why I'm opting for the bigger straw,

18:47.600 --> 18:49.280
I like it better.

18:49.280 --> 18:49.920
For the vibes.

18:50.480 --> 18:51.280
For the vibes.

18:51.280 --> 18:51.600
Yeah.

18:51.600 --> 18:52.240
For the vibes.

18:52.960 --> 18:53.680
Same thing.

18:53.680 --> 18:56.080
These straws are just too small.

18:56.080 --> 18:58.400
They create too much carbonation.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.440
And as a result,

18:59.440 --> 19:02.480
I don't get the flavor of the soda

19:02.480 --> 19:04.160
as much as just a bunch of bubbles

19:04.160 --> 19:05.520
and I don't like that much carbonation.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.680
That's significantly different.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.480
Carbonation.

19:08.480 --> 19:09.280
Yeah, between the two.

19:09.280 --> 19:10.960
Yeah, the flavor stays the same.

19:10.960 --> 19:11.840
Through all of them, I think.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.320
But the carbonation affects the flavor.

19:14.320 --> 19:14.880
It does.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.200
100% cross the board in every single one of these.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.120
Big straw is the better option.

19:19.120 --> 19:22.400
The flavor is better with less carbonation.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.320
So maybe McDonald's' secret sauce here

19:26.320 --> 19:28.080
isn't so much about like

19:28.080 --> 19:30.240
the flavor or anything like that.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.640
It really boils down to the straw.

19:33.360 --> 19:34.480
But what's interesting, right,

19:35.360 --> 19:36.720
is as we continue to drink this,

19:36.720 --> 19:39.440
as I get overwhelmed with the flavor of Sprite,

19:39.440 --> 19:42.640
I appreciate the watered-down,

19:42.640 --> 19:44.640
icy, you know, this is the guy

19:44.640 --> 19:46.960
that has the watered-down Sprite flavor.

19:46.960 --> 19:50.320
Whereas the other ones are just pure and unconcentrated.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.680
And so, like you said,

19:51.680 --> 19:54.320
this one tastes slightly different

19:54.320 --> 19:55.120
as a result of that.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.800
It tastes more mild.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.240
It's more soothing.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.560
And so, like, I feel like I can drink more of this.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.000
And this one at this point

20:02.000 --> 20:03.600
is like my favorite of these.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.000
Yeah.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.760
Because it's not just cloying the entire time.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.840
Yeah, it does feel more refreshing.

20:09.840 --> 20:10.560
I feel like that's...

20:10.560 --> 20:12.320
If I had to drink all of one of these,

20:12.320 --> 20:12.960
that one's bigger.

20:12.960 --> 20:13.920
So I don't know if that's fair.

20:13.920 --> 20:15.200
But I would drink more of that one.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.240
Yeah, it's mellower now at this point.

20:18.240 --> 20:19.760
Again, because of the ice.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.320
But as a result, I actually like it better.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.640
So maybe what the conclusion here

20:24.720 --> 20:29.200
is that normal Sprite is just too strong of a soda.

20:29.200 --> 20:31.440
And they just need to chill it out a little bit.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.160
Maybe.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.240
I mean, there's just a lot going on

20:34.240 --> 20:36.960
with flavor and carbonation in all of these.

20:36.960 --> 20:40.960
And that takes a little bit of it away, which is nice.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.480
Which brings us to the final variable,

20:43.360 --> 20:44.480
which is the fries.

20:44.480 --> 20:45.280
The French fries.

20:45.280 --> 20:45.600
Right?

20:45.600 --> 20:46.880
So now the question is,

20:46.880 --> 20:49.520
will the Sprite from McDonald's

20:49.520 --> 20:51.520
be specifically engineered

20:51.520 --> 20:52.880
to complement the flavor

20:52.880 --> 20:54.480
and the saltiness of the McDonald's, right?

20:54.560 --> 20:57.120
Because we've ultimately decided that the syrup

20:57.120 --> 20:58.640
tastes largely the same,

20:58.640 --> 21:00.560
I don't think that's going to be the case.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.360
I'm not super hopeful on this one, to be honest with you.

21:03.360 --> 21:06.000
This is better with fries than the bottle.

21:06.000 --> 21:06.480
I agree.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.040
Maybe just the sweetness of it.

21:09.040 --> 21:11.440
Oh, I don't like the fries with the bottle.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.040
This just feels right.

21:13.040 --> 21:13.600
Right?

21:13.600 --> 21:14.160
What is it?

21:14.160 --> 21:14.880
It's sweeter.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.000
I almost think the opposite.

21:16.000 --> 21:16.560
Really?

21:16.560 --> 21:19.120
Where I think these two that I just tried

21:19.120 --> 21:21.760
are so sweet and so flavored.

21:22.320 --> 21:23.280
Whereas this one, again,

21:23.280 --> 21:24.480
has a little bit of that wateriness to it,

21:24.480 --> 21:26.880
which balances, like, it's mellower

21:26.880 --> 21:28.240
and a little bit waterier,

21:28.240 --> 21:29.680
which balances out against the, like,

21:29.680 --> 21:31.280
salty greasiness of the fry.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.200
If you were to ask me which one I would want,

21:33.200 --> 21:35.360
just, like, by natural impulse,

21:35.360 --> 21:37.200
which one are you drinking with these fries?

21:39.280 --> 21:39.840
Hands down.

21:39.840 --> 21:40.560
Hands down.

21:40.560 --> 21:41.200
Hands down.

21:41.200 --> 21:41.840
Hands down.

21:41.840 --> 21:42.320
Right?

21:42.320 --> 21:45.040
And again, is it a flavor difference?

21:45.840 --> 21:46.080
No.

21:47.280 --> 21:48.640
It is more refreshing.

21:48.640 --> 21:49.520
It is.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.160
And it's got to be a mix of, like,

21:52.240 --> 21:54.400
water and carbonation,

21:54.400 --> 21:56.240
and it's refreshing.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.160
I feel like it's probably a combination

21:58.160 --> 22:00.240
of everything that we've talked about today, right?

22:00.240 --> 22:03.280
There is an element of the ice

22:03.280 --> 22:04.320
that's mixed into this,

22:04.320 --> 22:06.080
which makes it slightly more refreshing.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.920
There is an element of the straw,

22:07.920 --> 22:09.360
which makes it more consumable.

22:09.360 --> 22:10.800
And then, yeah, as I keep going back

22:10.800 --> 22:12.240
to the other sprites,

22:12.240 --> 22:15.280
all the other sprites have just that,

22:15.280 --> 22:16.880
again, like, such a strong flavor

22:16.880 --> 22:17.760
as opposed to this guy,

22:17.760 --> 22:20.880
which is different in a good way.

22:20.880 --> 22:21.440
Yeah.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.240
Top tier.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.040
Top tier.

22:23.040 --> 22:23.360
Why?

22:23.360 --> 22:24.000
I don't know.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.120
Yeah, yeah.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.920
It's top tier and not in a way

22:27.920 --> 22:29.680
that you can clearly articulate,

22:29.680 --> 22:30.880
but is better.

22:30.880 --> 22:31.440
Yeah.

22:31.440 --> 22:32.480
So there you have it.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.680
After rigorous testing

22:33.680 --> 22:35.360
and absolutely attacking our stomachs

22:35.360 --> 22:36.000
with sugar,

22:36.000 --> 22:37.440
we found that McDonald's sprite

22:37.440 --> 22:39.200
does indeed hit different,

22:39.200 --> 22:40.960
but not for the reasons you might expect.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.040
To start, the carbonation was actually

22:43.040 --> 22:45.040
less in the McDonald's sprite than the others.

22:45.040 --> 22:46.560
We didn't really feel that snap,

22:46.560 --> 22:47.840
crackle, or pop,

22:47.840 --> 22:48.480
but you know what?

22:48.480 --> 22:49.040
It worked.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.560
And we're not the only ones to think so.

22:50.560 --> 22:53.200
This one kind of tasted too fizzy for me.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.280
I actually kind of like these better than that one.

22:55.280 --> 22:56.480
The lack of carbonation there

22:56.480 --> 22:58.320
was a real surprise considering the science

22:58.320 --> 22:59.840
behind the McDonald's process.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.040
The cold filtered water

23:01.040 --> 23:02.640
should have allowed for more carbonation,

23:02.640 --> 23:03.840
but the ice and the rate at which

23:03.840 --> 23:05.120
the plastic cup heated up

23:05.120 --> 23:06.480
might have affected the fizziness.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.320
We also found that the flavor was milder

23:08.320 --> 23:09.520
and a little bit sweeter.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.200
Ultimately, it amounted to an overall

23:11.200 --> 23:12.720
more pleasant experience,

23:12.720 --> 23:14.000
and was the drink that we agreed

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
would be the one that we'd keep coming back to.

23:16.000 --> 23:16.720
But in the end,

23:16.720 --> 23:18.880
the one variable that made the biggest difference

23:18.880 --> 23:20.400
across all the taste tests

23:20.560 --> 23:21.840
is the bigger straw.

23:21.840 --> 23:23.360
The fact that, I gotta be honest,

23:23.360 --> 23:25.200
was absolutely shocking to me.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.040
The wider straw made the perfect balance

23:27.040 --> 23:28.240
so you got enough fluid

23:28.240 --> 23:29.440
so you could taste the flavors,

23:29.440 --> 23:32.320
but also adding in just the right amount of bubbles.

23:32.320 --> 23:33.600
And even though Rachel and I

23:33.600 --> 23:34.800
didn't quite see eye to eye

23:34.800 --> 23:36.000
on what made the fountain sprite

23:36.000 --> 23:37.600
our favorite to partner with the fries,

23:37.600 --> 23:38.960
it was in a different league

23:38.960 --> 23:39.920
than any of the others

23:39.920 --> 23:41.840
in terms of how refreshing it was to drink

23:41.840 --> 23:42.720
and how well it worked

23:42.720 --> 23:44.560
with all that salty greasiness.

23:44.560 --> 23:45.120
In the end,

23:45.120 --> 23:46.720
the secret to McDonald's sprite

23:46.720 --> 23:47.920
wasn't a matter of taste,

23:47.920 --> 23:49.200
which makes sense considering

23:49.200 --> 23:50.560
there's nothing special about the syrup

23:50.560 --> 23:51.760
that McDonald's is using

23:51.760 --> 23:53.120
nor the container they keep it in.

23:53.120 --> 23:53.600
Instead,

23:53.600 --> 23:55.120
it was a matter of how pleasant

23:55.120 --> 23:57.600
the entire drink experience ended up being.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.200
It's a finely tuned process

23:59.200 --> 24:01.040
that takes into account everything

24:01.040 --> 24:01.920
from temperature,

24:01.920 --> 24:02.720
the amount of ice,

24:02.720 --> 24:03.920
to straw your sipping through,

24:03.920 --> 24:05.280
the dishes that you're enjoying

24:05.280 --> 24:06.240
alongside the drink,

24:06.240 --> 24:07.520
all of those things combined

24:07.520 --> 24:09.840
to make McDonald's sprite truly special.

24:09.840 --> 24:10.240
And sure,

24:10.240 --> 24:11.920
it didn't quite make me feel like static,

24:11.920 --> 24:12.880
a lightning or the meteor

24:12.880 --> 24:14.160
that killed the dinosaurs,

24:14.160 --> 24:15.520
but we obeyed our thirst,

24:15.520 --> 24:16.720
and I was quenched.

24:16.800 --> 24:17.920
It'll quench ya.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.840
Nothing's quenched here.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.280
It's the quenched here.

24:21.280 --> 24:22.240
But hey,

24:22.240 --> 24:24.000
that's just a theory.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
A food theory.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.280
Bottoms up.
